    "it was einstein who soon after formulating his theory of general relativity , first introduced the idea of teleparallel gravity @xcite . in this new theory ,",
    "a set of four tetrad ( or vierbein ) fields form the orthogonal bases for the tangent space at each point of spacetime and torsion instead of curvature describes gravitational interactions .",
    "tetrads are the dynamical variables and play a similar role to the metric tensor field in general relativity .",
    "teleparallel gravity also uses the curvature - free weitzenbock connection instead of levi - civita connenction of general relativity to define covariant derivatives @xcite .",
    "after its first introduction , further important developments were made by several pioneering works in teleparallel gravity and it has been shown that teleparallel lagrangian density only differs with ricci scalar by a total divergence @xcite .",
    "this shows that general relativity and teleparallel gravity are dynamically equivalent theories where the difference arises only in boundary terms .",
    "however there are some fundamental conceptual differences between teleparallel theory and general relativity . according to general relativity",
    ", gravity curves the spacetime and shapes the geometry . in teleparallel theory however torsion does not shape the geometry but instead acts as a force .",
    "this means that there are no geodesics equations in teleparallel gravity but there are force equations much like the lorentz force in electrodynamics .",
    "recently with the discovery of accelerated cosmic expansion@xcite , modifying gravity beyond general relativity has generated much interest .",
    "one way to modify gravity is to replace the gr lagrangian density , @xmath2 , with a general function of ricci scalar .",
    "this approach leads to the so called @xmath1 theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "similarly one can try to modify gravity in the context of teleparallel formalism and replace the teleparallel lagrangian density , @xmath3 with a general function of @xmath3 which leads to the generalized teleparallel gravity or @xmath0 theories @xcite .",
    "the resulting field equations in @xmath0 theories are second order equations and are much simpler than the fourth order equations that appear in metric formalism of @xmath4 ) gravities .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath0 theories can explain the present time cosmic acceleration without resorting to some exotic dark energy @xcite .",
    "however one should remain cautious when selecting the form of function @xmath0 .",
    "it is a well established fact in our every day experience that weak - field gravitational bodies like the sun or the earth do not experience violent instabilities resulting in dramatic changes in their gravitational fields .",
    "so any theory which results in such instabilities should be clearly ruled out .",
    "it has been shown that some prototypes of @xmath1 theory suffer from these instabilities @xcite and a general condition for the stability of such theories has been derived @xcite .",
    "similarly one should consider stability of the theory in the weak - field limit of @xmath0 gravity . in this paper",
    "we show that matter is generally stable in the context of modified teleparallel gravity .",
    "in teleparallel gravity we need to define four orthogonal vector fields named tetrad which form the basis of spacetime .",
    "the manifold and the minkowski metrics are related as @xmath5 where the greek indices run from @xmath6 to @xmath7 in coordinate basis of the manifold , the latin indices run the same in tangent space of the manifold and @xmath8 .",
    "the connection in teleparallel theory , the weitzenbock connection , is defined as @xmath9 which gives the spacetime a nonzero torsion but zero curvature in contrast with general relativity . by this definition",
    "the torsion tensor and its permutations are @xcite @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is called the superpotential . in correspondence with ricci scalar",
    "we define a torsion scalar as @xmath14 so the gravitational action is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the determinant of the vierbein @xmath17 which is equal to @xmath18 .",
    "variation of the above action with respect to the vierbeins will give the teleparallel field equations @xmath19 now similar to modifying the action of general relativity which @xmath2 is replaced by a general function @xmath1 , one can replace the teleparallel action @xmath3 by a function @xmath0 . doing this , the resulting modified field equations are @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the energy momentum tensor of matter . in what follows we set @xmath23 .",
    "the main motivation for modifying gravity in both teleparallel and general relativity is the explanation of present time accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "if one considers a flat , homogeneous friedmann - robertson - walker universe , then the tetrads are @xmath24 and the torsion scalar will be @xmath25 from the field equation ( 9 ) one can derive the modified friedmann equation as @xcite @xmath26 to achieve the present time acceleration , any added term to the torsion scalar should be dominant at late times but negligible at early times . in ref .",
    "@xcite the form @xmath27 has been proposed .",
    "this gives the correct cosmological dynamics at late times without resorting to dark energy .",
    "now we turn to the problem of matter stability . following the above discussion",
    "we promote the torsion scalar , @xmath3 to a general function in the form @xmath28 where the parameter @xmath29 should be small to agree with recent observational constraints .",
    "to study the matter stability of a model of modified teleparallel gravity in the form ( 13 ) , we begin by taking the trace of field equation ( 9 )    @xmath30 @xmath31 substituting ( 13 ) , gives    @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 note that eqs .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 15 ) correspond to the trace of the equation of motion since the only kind of perturbations we take into account are the ones of conformal factor _",
    "i.e. _ scalar modes .",
    "now we apply this equation to the gravitational field of a weak - field object like the sun or the earth . for such gravitational bodies ,",
    "the torsion scalar in _ linear perturbation _ can be approximated by @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the linear perturbation and @xmath37 is the covariant derivative with the levi - civita connection .",
    "this equation followed from the fact that the torsion scalar @xmath3 and the ricci scalar @xmath2 only differ by a total divergence , @xmath38 .",
    "the minus sign in ( 16 ) comes from the fact that the torsion scalar is negative for a homogeneous and isotropic weak field gravitational body .",
    "the metric is also approximately can be taken as the minkowski metric plus some small perturbations @xmath39 where we assume perturbations to be homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "( 17 ) means that the vierbeins can also locally be written in the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a small perturbation in relation to the trivial tetrad .",
    "we can describe the deviation from the flat spacetime by [ 4 ] @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a dimensionless parameter which labels the order of perturbations . inserting this expansion in ( 17 ) , the corresponding expansion of the metric is @xmath44 and we have @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "+ here we consider only the first order or linear perturbations so from now on we drop the subscript @xmath47 from the equations .",
    "+ by perturbing the torsion in the form of equation ( 16 ) we ll have the following equation in linear perturbation theory for the nearly flat region inside a weak field celestial body ( see appendix for proof ) @xmath48    where @xmath49 is a positive constant . inserting ( 16 ) ,",
    "( 18 ) and ( 21 ) in ( 15 ) and keeping only the terms linear in perturbations , we get    @xmath50\\dot{t_{1}}\\ ] ] @xmath51t_{1}\\ ] ] @xmath52 + a(2+\\epsilon\\varphi')\\big[\\frac{\\dot{\\theta } } { 2\\sqrt{\\theta}}\\partial_{t}^{2}\\,\\tilde{e}_{\\nu}^{\\nu}\\big]\\ ] ] @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath49 and a dot denotes differentiation with respect to time . note",
    "that the perturbation equation in modified teleparallel gravity , equation ( 22 ) is a first order differential equation in contrast to the second order equations that appear in @xmath1 theories @xcite .",
    "the right hand side of ( 22 ) is a source term involving the matter content and also deviation from the flat background as in ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) .",
    "equation ( 22 ) can be rewritten in a concise form as @xmath55 where we have defined @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58\\ ] ] @xmath59-a(1+\\epsilon\\varphi')\\sqrt{\\theta}\\partial_{t}(\\tilde{e}_{i}^{\\nu } ) \\delta_{\\nu}^{i}\\ ] ] @xmath60 let us make a comparison between values of the terms in @xmath61 . for a typical gravitational body",
    "the energy - momentum scalar , @xmath62 , is proportional to the mass density of the body and is positive @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the mass density of the body .",
    "for example we have @xmath65 for the earth and @xmath66 for the sun .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is fixed in such a way that it gives the correct cosmological dynamics at late times , so it should be extremely small .",
    "for example , a common class of functions that are popular in @xmath0 literature is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is some real number and the @xmath69 parameter will be fixed to a value that the model can reproduce the late time accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . for this model",
    "we have @xmath70    from this it is obvious that the first term in @xmath61 is much larger than the other two terms and we can safely neglect the second and third terms .",
    "doing this , equation ( 22 ) becomes    @xmath71t_{1}\\ ] ] @xmath72    let s consider the time evolution of perturbations . from the form of differential equation ( 28 )",
    "it is obvious that first order perturbations , @xmath36 will grow with time if the coefficient of @xmath36 in ( 28 ) is negative and decreases with time if the coefficient is positive .",
    "growing of perturbations with time will mean that the torsion will rise very quickly and leads to strong instability while a decreasing perturbations will mean that the gravitational field will bounce back to its equilibrium state and so the body is stable . the coefficient of @xmath36 in ( 28 )",
    "is dominated by the last term @xmath73 due to extremely small value of @xmath29 .",
    "note that @xmath74 and @xmath62 are positive so from this discussion it is obvious that the coefficient of @xmath36 will always remain positive and as a result the matter in these types of theories is always stable .",
    "now we turn our attention to the case of a radiation fluid . for this type of matter the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath62 is vanishing . from ( 16 ) we have @xmath75 . inserting this in the trace of field equation ( 9 ) yields @xmath76 where by definition @xmath77 @xmath78 solving equation ( 29 ) for the time evolution of @xmath36 gives @xmath79 which of course is always stable because the perturbations will become constant after some time . here",
    "@xmath80 is an integration constant .",
    "the limiting value is given by @xmath81 which is extremely small because of the value of @xmath29 .",
    "figure ( 1 ) shows the qualitative behaviour of @xmath36 as given by equation ( 31 ) .",
    "from a geometric point of view , modifying gravity seems a necessary task in order to explain recent positively accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "any such modified theory , whether it is in the context of general relativity or in teleparallel gravity , may be expected to show some strong deviation from the standard gravity at very high energies and in strong - field regimes .",
    "this is because we still do not have a proper theory of quantum gravity to describe the behavior of gravitational interactions at those energies . on the other hand any strong deviation from the standard gravity at low energies and weak - field regimes",
    "immediately disqualify the theory because it will contradicts well established weak - field experiments .",
    "one of these experiments is the stability of weak - field celestial bodies or any other weak gravity objects . in this paper",
    "we ve investigated the stability of such objects in the context of modified teleparallel gravity .",
    "the analysis shows that there is no dolgov - kawasaki matter instability in these type of theories .",
    "in contrast , in the corresponding @xmath1 theories a certain stability condition should be met .",
    "this gives a great advantage to @xmath0 theories over their @xmath1 counterparts because from matter stability viewpoint , there is no limit on the form of functions that can be chosen to replace the torsion scalar in the action of @xmath0 theories .",
    "we note that we have extended our analysis to the second order of perturbations and we have observed that the matter is still stable in this scenario",
    ". +    [ [ section ] ]    here we present the proof of equation ( 23 ) for an almost flat region inside a weak field gravitational body .",
    "for such an object the tetrad and metric are given by equations ( 18 ) and ( 20 ) respectively .",
    "considering only the first order perturbations and dropping the subscript we have the following equations for the torsion and superpotential tensors @xmath82 + and + @xmath83 @xmath84 the tensor @xmath85 is not necessarily symmetric but it has been shown that the anti - symmetric part of it has no physical significance in the field equations so we assume it to be symmetric here[4 ] .",
    "furthermore for an almost flat region inside a star , we can safely assume that both the background and the first order correction are homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "in that case the torsion and its perturbation does not depend on spatial coordinates and we have @xmath86 . also for a homogeneous and isotropic perturbation the first order correction of the tetrad has the form @xmath87 and @xmath88 only depends on time . substituting this in ( a1 ) and ( a2 )",
    ", we can find the torsion scalar as @xmath89 up to the first order in perturbations , the second term in the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( 16 ) will be @xmath90 .",
    "on the other hand the only non zero components of the superpotential tensor are all the same ( up to a sign ) and proportional to @xmath91 , in particular we have @xmath92 so we will have the relation @xmath93 substituting from ( 16 ) , equation ( 23 ) is obtained .",
