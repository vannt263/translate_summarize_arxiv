    "the quantum tunneling in a double - well potential appears in a variety of physical cases .",
    "well - known examples include inversion of ammonia molecule @xcite , for which the double - well is symmetric , and proton tunneling in hydrogen bonds , for which the two wells could be unsymmetrical @xcite . for a symmetric potential , instanton method developed in @xcite , has been elaborated and applied to calculate energy splitting @xcite .",
    "the tunneling splitting calculated from the instanton method exactly agrees with the wkb result when the quadratic connection formula is adopted , and it has been confirmed that the result is very accurate for large separation between the two wells @xcite .",
    "quantum tunneling in asymmetric double - well potentials has also long been considered @xcite , and one of the intriguing properties in these cases is the appearance of resonances .",
    "for example , the wave function appropriate for the false vacuum of the potential @xmath2 &                ~{\\rm for}~ x < 0\\\\            \\frac{m\\omega^2}{2}(x-\\beta)^2      & ~ { \\rm for}~ x\\geq 0 ,           \\end{array}\\right . \\label{v_d}\\ ] ] ( @xmath3 ) can significantly tunnel to the side of @xmath4 only when @xmath5 is tuned to satisfy the condition @xmath6 through various numerical calculations , it has been known that the appearance of these resonances is not limited to @xmath7 , but is a general property of tunneling in asymmetric potentials @xcite . in this paper , in order to elucidate the analytic structures of the resonances , we construct the wkb wave functions for a class of asymmetric double - well potentials .",
    "specifically , we consider a smooth double - well potential @xmath8 , assuming that @xmath8 has minima at @xmath9 and at @xmath10  ( @xmath11 ) , and a local maximum at @xmath12 .",
    "the minima are taken to be quadratic with a frequency @xmath0 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ( see fig . [ fig ] ) . as in the instanton method ,",
    "we are interested in the large separation between the two wells , and consider the ground and low lying excited states of energy eigenvalue @xmath15 satisfying @xmath16 .",
    "we also assume that the potential is still quadratic near the classical turning points between the wells .    around the minima ,",
    "exact solutions to the schrdinger equation are described by the parabolic cylinder functions @xcite . on both sides of @xmath12 , a wkb wave function",
    "is constructed by matching the wkb function to the asymptotic forms of the exact solutions near the classical turning points .",
    "the continuities of the wave function and its first derivative at the local maximum then give the energy - level splitting formula .",

    "the splitting formula is found from these wave functions .",
    "indeed it turns out that the wkb wave functions satisfying the continuities could be written as linear combinations of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , while the linear combinations lift the degeneracy to make the splitting .",
    "therefore , a linear combination of the time - dependent wkb wave functions gives a system which shuttles back and forth between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , to clearly elucidate the resonance structure of the tunneling in the asymmetric potential of @xmath19 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : continuity ] , we construct the wkb wave function on both sides of the local maximum and , by requiring the continuities at the maximum , we evaluate the energy splitting . in section [ sec : tunneling ] , we find the appropriate localized wave functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 , to re - obtain the energy splitting formula .",
