    "the random vortex world - surface model is a concrete realization of the center vortex picture of the strong interaction vacuum @xcite , i.e. , the notion that the relevant infrared gluonic degrees of freedom of the strong interaction are closed tubes of quantized chromomagnetic flux .",
    "the random vortex world - surface model was initially investigated for @xmath2 yang - mills theory @xcite , and in this simplest case , the main characteristics of the strongly interacting vacuum were reproduced . both a confining low - temperature phase as well as a deconfined high - temperature phase",
    "are found @xcite , separated by a second - order deconfinement phase transition ; furthermore , the topological susceptibility @xcite and the ( quenched ) chiral condensate @xcite match the ones extracted from @xmath2 lattice yang - mills theory quantitatively . extending the investigation to the @xmath3 gauge group @xcite , the deconfinement phase transition exhibits weakly first - order behavior @xcite , and a y - law for the baryonic static potential",
    "is found @xcite , again matching the corresponding characteristics of @xmath3 lattice yang - mills theory .",
    "studies of the topological and chiral properties in the @xmath3 case are pending .    the aforementioned successes of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 random vortex world - surface models are obtained on the basis of very simple vortex dynamics , with the action determined purely by world - surface curvature . accordingly , these models only contain one dimensionless coupling parameter , which is adjusted in practice to reproduce the ratio of the deconfinement temperature @xmath4 to the square root of the zero - temperature string tension @xmath5 found in the corresponding yang - mills theory .",
    "recent efforts have focused on the question of how far this simple picture carries as the gauge group is varied .",
    "there are two systematic ways of extending the yang - mills gauge group beyond the cases discussed above : on the one hand , one may increase the number of colors @xmath6 determining the @xmath7 gauge symmetry ; on the other hand @xcite , the @xmath2 group can alternatively be considered as the smallest symplectic group @xmath8 , and the @xmath9 sequence can also be used to generalize @xmath10 . accordingly",
    ", random vortex world - surface models for the infrared sectors of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 yang - mills theory have been constructed @xcite and are presented in the following . in both cases , new dynamical characteristics emerge .",
    "the concrete modeling methodology used in the random vortex world - surface model is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "vortex world - surfaces are composed of elementary squares on a hypercubic space - time lattice . the lattice spacing is a fixed physical quantity related to the transverse thickness of vortices ; it represents the ultraviolet cutoff inherent in any infrared effective description .",
    "an ensemble of closed vortex world - surfaces is generated by monte carlo update .",
    "for different underlying gauge groups , random vortex world - surface models differ in two respects : on the one hand , the quantization of vortex flux is determined by the center of the gauge group . when encircling a vortex , a wilson loop acquires a phase given by one of the nontrivial center elements .",
    "accordingly , in general , several species of center vortices , corresponding to the different nontrivial center elements , can exist .",
    "they can merge and disassociate into one another . on the other hand",
    ", the models can differ in the effective action governing the vortices .",
    "the @xmath0 group contains the nontrivial center elements @xmath11 .",
    "vortex fluxes associated with the elements @xmath12 and @xmath13 are related by an inversion of space - time orientation ; therefore , there are altogether only two physically distinct types of center vortices .",
    "a vortex generating a phase factor @xmath14 when linked to a wilson loop can branch into two vortices associated with a phase factor @xmath15 and vice versa .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath0 yang - mills theory @xcite also induces two distinct string tensions , the quark string tension @xmath16 and the diquark string tension @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath0 yang - mills confinement properties thus are characterized by the ratios @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as well as the behavior at the deconfinement phase transition , which is about twice as strongly first - order as the one of @xmath3 yang - mills theory .    to properly model these characteristics ,",
    "it is necessary to use an effective vortex action which is more complicated than for @xmath2 or @xmath3 , and which can be symbolically represented as @xmath20        @xmath21    @xmath12    the first term is the curvature term already used in the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 models .",
    "it penalizes configurations in which two vortex squares share a link without lying in the same plane by an action increment @xmath22 depending on the types of vortices participating ; in the @xmath0 case , there are two vortex types , @xmath23 . studying a model based only on this term led to the conclusion that it can not faithfully reproduce the confinement properties of @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath24 is tuned to the correct value , the deconfinement phase transition is second - order .",
    "consequently , additional dynamics must be introduced , embodied in the second term in , the branching term .",
    "it facilitates vortex branchings by weighting links at which 3 or 5 vortex squares meet with an action decrement @xmath25 .    using this action , agreement with the @xmath0 yang - mills confinement characteristics is reached at the physical point @xcite @xmath26",
    "it should be noted that , in abelian gauges , vortex branching can be associated with abelian magnetic monopoles @xcite .",
    "thus , the above result can be interpreted as implying that a realistic vortex model for @xmath0 yang - mills theory is only achieved by including a dependence of the vortex dynamics on the configuration of the abelian magnetic monopoles which reside on the vortices in abelian gauges @xcite .",
    "this confirms a corresponding expectation formulated in @xcite , that abelian magnetic monopoles begin to play a role in infrared yang - mills vortex dynamics as the number of colors @xmath6 is raised . note that abelian magnetic monopoles are also present in @xmath2 and @xmath3 vortex configurations ; however , there is no signature for an independent dynamical role of these monopoles .",
    "their distribution appears to be essentially determined by the dynamics of the vortices on which they reside .",
    "a remarkable property of the @xmath9 sequence of groups is that all members have the same center , @xmath27 , and allow for the same set of center vortex degrees of freedom .",
    "there is only one nontrivial center element , @xmath14 , and therefore only one type of vortex flux .",
    "nevertheless , the effective vortex actions can be very different for different underlying @xmath9 groups ; after all , different cosets would be integrated out in each case if one were to derive the effective vortex action from first principles",
    ". therefore , vortex models for different @xmath9 yang - mills theories are by no means forced to display similar confinement characteristics , such as deconfinement transitions of the same order .",
    "indeed , while @xmath10 yang - mills theory exhibits a second - order deconfinement phase transition , the deconfinement transition of @xmath1 yang - mills theory is strongly first - order @xcite .",
    "as above , in order to generate such behavior , new dynamics must be introduced compared to the @xmath2 vortex model .",
    "the confinement characteristics of @xmath1 yang - mills theory can be reproduced using an effective vortex action of the symbolic form    @xmath28        the first term is the curvature term already discussed above . the second term can be interpreted in terms of a `` stickiness '' of vortices : when 4 ( or even 6 ) vortex squares meet at a link , this corresponds to 2 ( or even 3 ) intersecting vortex fluxes maintaining contact to one another for a finite space - time length instead of intersecting only at one space - time point .",
    "enhancing such behavior by choosing a negative value for @xmath29 means that vortices become stickier .",
    "indeed , a first - order deconfinement phase transition of the proper strength , together with the correct value of @xmath30 is achieved at the physical point @xcite",
    "extending the yang - mills gauge group to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , new dynamics emerge in the corresponding infrared effective vortex descriptions .",
    "the @xmath0 case exhibits clear signatures of abelian magnetic monopoles ( which are intrinsically present in vortex configurations cast in abelian gauges ) attaining a dynamical significance of their own as the number of colors is raised .",
    "this corroborates related arguments put forward in @xcite . in the @xmath1 case , a new `` stickiness '' term in the effective action serves to drive the deconfinement transition towards the correct first - order behavior .",
    "while @xmath10 and @xmath1 yang - mills theory contain the same center vortex degrees of freedom , the vortex effective actions in the two cases differ and thus naturally lead to different behavior at the deconfinement transition .    having determined the physical points and of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 infrared effective vortex models ,",
    "the behavior of the spatial string tensions at high temperatures can be predicted @xcite . as discussed further in @xcite , comparison with measurements in the corresponding full lattice",
    "yang - mills theories can be used to test the validity of the model constructions presented here .",
