    "oscillations of a pendulum with periodically varying length ( ppvl ) is one of the classical problems in mechanics , see @xcite .",
    "we represent ppvl as a weightless rod with a point mass sliding along the rod axis according to periodic law .",
    "this is also a simple model of child s swing . in works @xcite small oscillations of ppvl",
    "were studied . in @xcite",
    "the instability domains of the vertical position were found both analytically and numerically .",
    "regular rotations and chaotic regimes were also investigated , see @xcite .    in the literature oscillatory and rotational approximate solutions for ppvl",
    "were obtained with quasi - linear approach , where nonlinearity was assumed to be small as well as the excitation amplitude .",
    "the only exception is @xcite , where exact stable uniform rotations were found in the case of zero damping and harmonic excitation with special amplitude and phase .",
    "but these uniform rotations occur only for very restrictive relation of parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "quasi - linear approach requires taking high order approximations for substantially nonlinear regimes , such as regular rotations with frequencies higher than the frequency of excitation , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "that makes approximate expressions cumbersome and analysis difficult , while the error of approximation can still be high , because the smallness assumption of both excitation and nonlinearity might not be satisfied for any existing rotations .    in order to resolve this issue in the present paper",
    "we analyze boundaries in the parameter space for oscillatory , rotational , and more complex ( rotational - oscillatory , chaotic ) regimes of ppvl assuming arbitrary ( not small ) nonlinearity .    on one hand , the methods used for studying other parametrically excited pendula , such as a pendulum with vibrating pivot @xcite ,",
    "can also be applied to ppvl .",
    "in particular , we apply melnikov analysis in a similar way to @xcite , that is applicable when excitation and damping are small .",
    "we also compare the obtained boundaries with the results of numerical simulations .",
    "on the other hand , our paper contains a methodological novelty since the rotational regimes are studied without the assumption that excitation is small . instead of this , to apply the method of averaging , we assume that the frequency of excitation is large . in that case",
    "the unperturbed system preserves angular momentum , which is a distinctive feature of ppvl . as a result the first order approximation happens to be enough to find approximate solutions of different angular velocities .",
    "we also study the stability of these solutions , find their existence domains in parameter space , and compare them with the results of numerical simulations .",
    "numerical simulations were made in @xcite for different amplitudes and frequencies of excitation , starting from the same initial conditions .",
    "after sufficiently high time of simulation the solutions converged to regular regimes ( equilibrium , oscillations , rotations ) or remained `` chaotic '' .",
    "thus we have the points in parameter space , where corresponding regimes exist , for comparison with the analytically obtained approximations of the corresponding existence domains .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "s : main ] main equations of motion of a pendulum with variable length are derived and given in non - dimensional form . in section [ s : melnikov ] we use melnikov s analysis @xcite to find bifurcations of homoclinic , oscillatory and subharmonic rotational orbits of ppvl .",
    "melnikov s functions are obtained and compared with the results of numerical simulation . in section  [ s : avg ]",
    "we find bifurcations of superharmonic rotational orbits with the use of the averaging method and compare them with the numerical simulation results . in section  [ s : avg ]",
    "we find the domains of existence of the rotational solutions under assumption that the unperturbed system preserves the angular momentum ( rather than hamiltonian as in the melnikov s analysis ) and allows for non - small excitation amplitude .",
    "equation for motion of the ppvl is derived with the use of angular momentum alteration theorem and taking into account linear damping forces , see @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the mass , @xmath2 is the length , @xmath3 is the angle of the pendulum deviation from the vertical position , @xmath4 is the damping coefficient , and @xmath5 is the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "it is assumed that the length of the pendulum changes according to a periodic law @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mean pendulum length , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the amplitude and frequency of the excitation , @xmath10 is a smooth zero mean periodic function with period @xmath11 .",
    "we introduce new time @xmath12 and three dimensionless parameters @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the eigenfrequency of the pendulum with constant length @xmath15 and zero damping . in this notations equation ( [ eq_swing ] )",
    "takes the form @xmath16 where the upper dot denotes differentiation with respect to new time @xmath17 .",
    "assuming @xmath18 , equation ( [ eq : swing2 ] ) can be written in the following form @xmath19 coefficients of nonlinear equation ( [ eq_theta ] ) explicitly depend on the periodic function @xmath10 and three independent dimensionless parameters : the relative excitation amplitude @xmath20 , the damping @xmath21 , and the inverse relative frequency of excitation @xmath22 .",
    "let us assume that parameters of excitation amplitude @xmath20 and damping @xmath21 are small of the same order , @xmath23 .",
    "thus , we can say that dynamics of ppvl is described by the perturbed hamiltonian system @xmath24 where the perturbation function @xmath25 is of the first order of smallness , i.e. @xmath26 . the following function @xmath27 is the hamiltonian of the unperturbed system @xmath28 which is system ( [ eq : hpert_theta])([eq : g1 ] ) with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the unperturbed system describes motions of the pendulum with constant length and zero damping , so the system has the first integral @xmath31 .",
    "unperturbed system ( [ eq : hunpert_theta])([eq : hunpert_v ] ) has an oscillatory solution if @xmath32 and a rotational solution if @xmath33 . if @xmath34 the solution is a separatrix dividing oscillatory and rotational domains in phase space ( @xmath35 ) .      in order to apply melnikov s criterion @xcite to a homoclinic orbit",
    "we find the separatrix of the unperturbed system ( [ eq : hunpert_theta])([eq : hunpert_v ] ) that goes through the saddle - node point @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "for this point we have @xmath38 and with the use of ( [ eq : h ] ) obtain @xmath39 .",
    "so , the separatrix has the following form @xmath40 this equation allows for separation of variables and the following integration @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a constant of integration .",
    "potentiation of ( [ eq : sprtrx_int ] ) with some transformations yields @xmath43      \\displaystyle\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right ) & = & \\displaystyle\\pm\\tanh\\left(\\omega\\left(\\tau-\\tau_0\\right)\\right ) .",

    "@xmath48 this is a sign - changing function if the following inequality is satisfied @xmath49 according to melnikov s criterion @xcite when condition ( [ eq : con ] ) is satisfied then homoclinic structure and complex dynamics appear near the separatrix . condition ( [ eq : con ] ) means that complex dynamics appears only when the amplitude of excitation is sufficiently large with respect to the damping coefficient .",

    "similar inequality for the pendulum with vertically vibrating pivot was obtained in @xcite , where the right - hand side function is three times greater than that in ( [ eq : con ] ) .      in order to apply melnikov s criterion to oscillatory orbits",
    "we find oscillatory solutions of the unperturbed system ( [ eq : hunpert_theta])-([eq : hunpert_v ] ) .",
    "for this reason we introduce the amplitude of oscillations @xmath47 so that from the first integral for @xmath37 we have @xmath53 and with the use of ( [ eq : h ] ) we obtain @xmath54 .",
    "thus , we can write the following equation @xmath55 which allows for separation of variables . in order to integrate ( [ eq : oscl ] ) one usually introduces ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) a monotonically increasing phase @xmath56 such that @xmath57 where instead of amplitude @xmath47 one uses @xmath58 , which is called modulus in elliptic integrals",
    ". we have from ( [ eq : kpsi ] ) equation ( [ eq : oscl ] ) in the form @xmath59 .",
    "this equation along with time - differentiation of ( [ eq : kpsi ] ) yields @xmath60 . as a result of integration starting from time @xmath42 , when @xmath61 , we have @xmath62 and consequently @xmath63 and @xmath64      \\displaystyle \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right ) & = & k\\,{{\\rm \\,sn}}\\!\\left(\\omega\\left(\\tau-\\tau_0\\right),k\\right ) ,      \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are the ( elliptic ) jacobi functions . the elliptic amplitude function @xmath65 is the inverse of the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind @xmath69 and other elliptic functions are defined as follows : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",

    "similar inequality was obtained in @xcite , with the right - hand side function being three times greater than that in ( [ eq : con3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the melnikov approach leads to similar results for different models of pendula .",
    "we study resonant rotations @xmath104 where @xmath95 is the number of full rotations during @xmath77 complete periods of excitation .",
    "the new assumption here is that the relative eigenfrequency @xmath105 is small of the same order with damping parameter @xmath106 , e.g. because of the small gravitation @xmath5 or high excitation frequency @xmath107 , while the excitation amplitude @xmath20 is not small .",
    "then , unperturbed system ( equation ( [ eq : swing2 ] ) with @xmath108 ) has the specific angular momentum or sector velocity @xmath109 as its first integral .",
    "the unperturbed system is not hamiltonian , so we can not apply melnikov s analysis to obtain domains of existence of corresponding rotations . for this purpose",
    "we use the method of averaging , @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : swing2 ] ) can be written in the form of the system @xmath110 where the perturbation function is the following @xmath111 with the ratio @xmath112 that can be considered as a new parameter .",
    "the unperturbed system has the following solution @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the constant phase shift , @xmath115 is the constant sector velocity , and @xmath116 denotes the following integral @xmath117 we choose such constants @xmath115 and @xmath114 , that they approximate the perturbed solution , i.e. @xmath118 . in order to do",
    "so we take a resonance condition from ( [ eq : resrq ] ) along with the following _ averaged equation _ of ( [ eq : sdot ] ) @xmath119where the first order approximation function @xmath120 is derived via the substitution in @xmath121 variable @xmath3 by the expression @xmath122 and taking time - average of @xmath121 as if the corresponding _ averaged variable _",
    "@xmath123 and @xmath124 are constant , see @xcite : @xmath125 where @xmath47 and @xmath126 denote the following integrals @xmath127 the period of averaging is chosen @xmath128 to contain integer numbers of motion and excitation periods .",
    "notice that the averaged equation of ( [ eq : thetadot ] ) @xmath129 does not influence the dynamics of @xmath123 in ( [ eq : sdotavg ] ) and for constant ( steady state ) @xmath123 has the solution @xmath130 .",
    "the steady state value of @xmath123 follows from resonance condition ( [ eq : resrq ] ) written with the use of solution ( [ eq : solform ] ) and stating that period of rotation and period of excitation should be in rational relation @xmath131 where @xmath95 and @xmath77 are relatively prime natural numbers from ( [ eq : resrq ] ) .",
    "we have from ( [ eq : resr ] ) the approximate steady state value , @xmath132 , where @xmath133 values of @xmath124 we find from the averaged equation ( [ eq : sdotavg ] ) when we set @xmath134 and substitute @xmath123 by its steady state value @xmath115 expressed in ( [ eq : sbar ] ) , so that @xmath135 : @xmath136 thus , we find @xmath137 , that takes values form two branches ( @xmath89 ) of the solution @xmath138 where the constant @xmath139 can be expressed as follows @xmath140 with @xmath141 being an integer number .",
    "thus , the domain of existence of corresponding regular rotations is approximated by the following condition that equation ( [ eq : ss ] ) has the solution expressed in ( [ eq : thetabar ] ) , @xmath142    the averaged variables @xmath123 and @xmath143 approximate the slow variable @xmath144 and fast phase @xmath145 , which solve system ( [ eq : thetadot])([eq : sdot ] ) .",
    "the solution for regular rotational motion in resonance @xmath96 can be written as follows @xmath146 where @xmath115 and @xmath114 are defined in ( [ eq : sbar ] ) and ( [ eq : thetabar ] ) .",
    "we obtain here only the first order approximation with the use of averaged equation ( [ eq : sdotavg ] ) . in order to obtain higher order approximations the general averaging scheme by volosov",
    "can be applied to system ( [ eq : thetadot])-([eq : sdot ] ) , see @xcite .      in order to study the stability of a solution @xmath147 we perturb it by small value @xmath148 in ( [ eq : sdotavg ] ) .",
    "thus we have the linearized equation @xmath149with the derivative of function @xmath120 in the form @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the derivatives of integrals @xmath47 and @xmath126 in ( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] ) : @xmath153 according to lyapunov s theorem on stability based on a linear approximation the instability or asymptotic stability of the solution @xmath123 of equation ( [ eq : sdotavg ] ) is determined by the instability or asymptotic stability of the linearized equation ( [ eq : sdotavglin ] ) .",
    "thus , for steady state solution , @xmath154 , we have the condition of asymptotic stability @xmath155 : @xmath156 this condition is checked numerically for various parameters @xmath20 and @xmath157 , see fig .",
    "[ f : super_rot ] ( left ) .",
    "it turns out that only one branch of the solution , that corresponds to plus ( @xmath158 ) in ( [ eq : thetabar ] ) , can be stable .",
    "moreover there are regions ( denoted with hatch lines in fig .",
    "[ f : super_rot ] ) where both existing branches of the solution are unstable .",
    "superharmonic bifurcations of rotational orbits happen on the upper borders of the corresponding hatched areas .",
    "although it would be natural to expect that exact ( not approximate ) borders of existence domain coincide with the border of stability domain .",
    "[ f : super_rot_data ]      in order to find the boundaries for rotational regimes with relative angular velocities @xmath159 the first approximation is enough , because excitation amplitude @xmath20 is not small in contrast to the quasi - linear approach in @xcite , where both @xmath20 and @xmath22 are assumed to be small and higher order approximations of the averaging method are needed to obtain similar boundaries .",
    "notice that it is also possible to consider not small damping @xmath21 when sector velocity @xmath160 is small , because they are multiplied in the first term of perturbation function ( [ eq : f1 ] ) .    the right hand side in condition ( [ eq : con4 ] )",
    "can be calculated for any particular @xmath20 , @xmath95 , and @xmath77 , see fig .",
    "[ f : super_rot ] , where @xmath161 . in order to do that",

    "[ f : super_rot ] we depict the points where numerical simulation converged to regular rotations .",
    "the points have different colors for relative angular velocities @xmath159 .",
    "all these points are above the corresponding boundaries of existence domains which have same colors .",
    "thus , existence condition ( [ eq : con4 ] ) is satisfied for all numerically obtained rotational solutions .",
    "for the pendulum with variable length we derived analytical formulas for the boundaries of bifurcations in the space of three parameters : the relative frequency of excitation , amplitude of excitation , and damping .",
    "the boundaries for homoclinic bifurcation separating the domain of only stationary and oscillatory regimes from the domain of more complex dynamics , subharmonic oscillations and subharmonic rotations are obtained using melnikov s method under assumption of small damping and excitation amplitude . for the analysis of superharmonic bifurcations of rotational orbits the method of averaging",
    "is used assuming smallness of relative excitation frequency rather than that of excitation amplitude .",
    "both methods allow to obtain in the first approximation the basic rotational orbit with angular velocity equal to the excitation frequency , @xmath162 .",
    "small excitation frequency ( or small gravity ) allows to introduce the unperturbed system with the conservation of angular momentum , so that faster rotations are found in the first approximation by the method of averaging . in figs .",
