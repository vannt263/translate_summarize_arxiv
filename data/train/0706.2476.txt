    "ensembles of matrices with random elements have been widely studied since the pioneering works of wigner @xcite and dyson @xcite on the threefold way. a first , gross classification of random matrix ( rm ) models can take into account i ) whether the size @xmath5 of the matrices in the ensemble is finite or the limit @xmath6 is taken and ii ) whether the probability distribution of the entries remains invariant after a rotation in the matrix space .",
    "the requirement of rotational invariance implies that the joint probability density ( jpd ) of the eigenvalues can be written as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a confining potential ( @xmath9 for gaussian ensembles ) and the interaction term between eigenvalues is the well - known vandermonde determinant raised to the power @xmath2 .",
    "the dyson index @xmath2 can classically take _ only _ the values @xmath10 according to the number of variables needed to specify a single entry ( @xmath11 for real , @xmath12 for complex and @xmath13 for quaternion numbers ) . this @xmath2 index in turn identifies the symmetry group of the ensemble ( orthogonal , unitary and symplectic respectively ) .",
    "thanks to the works of mehta @xcite and many others , very powerful analytical tools are available to deal with invariant ensembles , both for finite @xmath5 and as @xmath6 , the latter limit being usually the most interesting for rm theorists",
    ". however , it was very soon realized that matrices with the smallest size @xmath14 can equally well provide deep insights and trigger new ideas , the most successful one being the celebrated wigner s surmise @xcite which gives an excellent approximation for the level spacing of bigger matrices .",
    "the study of @xmath0 random matrices has since been strongly developed and it remains an active area of research in mathematical physics @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to introduce and solve exactly a family of @xmath0 random matrices depending on one parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this ensemble will have rotational invariance _ but _ a real effective dyson index @xmath3 in an interval .",
    "although it is commonly assumed that the two properties :    * rotational invariance ; * real dyson index .    are essentially incompatible , since the dyson index of an invariant ensemble is strictly constrained to the values @xmath15 or @xmath13 as described above , we will show how to construct explicitly a counterexample in section [ mainidea ] introducing suitable correlations among the matrix entries .",
    "the motivation for this study stems from two apparently unrelated issues , namely the dumitriu - edelman @xmath2-ensembles @xcite and the so - called poisson - wigner crossover for the level spacing @xcite . in order to make the paper",
    "self - contained , we give a brief introduction to both of them highlighting also the two main tasks we tackle in this paper . in subsection [ summary ] , we provide the plan of the article .",
    "consider the jpd .",
    "does there exist a non - trivial matrix model having as its jpd of eigenvalues for _ any _ @xmath16 ? very recently , dumitriu and edelman were able to answer this question affirmatively @xcite .",
    "they introduced two ensembles of tridiagonal @xmath17 matrices with independent entries , whose jpd of eigenvalues is exactly given by for general @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "these ensembles have been called @xmath2-hermite and @xmath2-laguerre , according to the classical weight their jpd contains .",
    "this result is essential for an efficient numerical sampling of random matrices @xcite and has triggered a significant amount of further research @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath2-ensembles , having independent non - gaussian entries are obviously _ non - invariant_. thus , the first novel task we tackle in this paper ( section [ gaussian ] ) is the following :    design and solve exactly a @xmath18 ensemble with :    * rotational invariance ; * running @xmath19 +   are given in section [ gaussian ] . ]",
    "+ ; * assigned classical potential ( in particular , gaussian - hermite ) .    in fact , an invariant matrix model displaying a running dyson index would be of great interest : tuning the strength of the correlations between the eigenvalues in has significant importance for systems which , although endowed with an intrinsic invariance , are subjected to a weak non - invariant perturbation ( see e.g. @xcite ) and may also have important implications for lattice gas theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is a long - standing observation that nuclear systems with two - body interactions display an average density of states whose profile is much closer to a gaussian distribution @xcite@xcite than to a semicircle .",
    "hence , a rm approach with the appropriate symmetries clearly requires much weaker , and possibly suppressed altogether , correlations among the energy levels than those arising from with integer and fixed @xmath2 . in this respect , the limit @xmath20 of our model is particularly appealing ( see section [ gaussian ] ) .",
    "another interesting transitional regime in quantum chaos theory , namely the so - called poisson - wigner crossover for level spacings , has attracted much attention in the past twenty years @xcite . in terms of the dimensionless nearest - neighbor spacing @xmath21",
    ", the poisson and wigner distributions are given by : @xmath22 and correspond to the limiting cases of classical dynamics , namely purely regular and completely chaotic .",
    "intermediate regimes between those two extremes have been intensely investigated ( see @xcite for a review ) , and interpolating phenomenological formulas have been proposed , the most famous being the brody @xcite and berry - robnik @xcite distributions .",
    "the quest for a deeper understanding of such a crossover has motivated many proposals of parametrical random matrix models whose level spacing distribution interpolates between and @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "normally , the requirement of rotational invariance is the first to be dropped in those models .",
    "the reason is easy to understand : once this condition is imposed , the vandermonde - coupling between the eigenvalues forces the level spacing @xmath23 to display a term of the form @xmath24 ( @xmath4 ) and thus is very stiff , at least for small values of the gap @xmath21 .",
    "no meaningful crossover could occur in such models for any standard choice of the confining potential .",
    "this problem would be overcome by an invariant model with a tunable index @xmath3 and thus leads to our second unconventional task ( section [ nongaussian ] ) :    design and solve exactly a @xmath18 ensemble with :    * rotational invariance ; * running @xmath19 ; * assigned level - spacing profile .",
    "the @xmath0 ensemble we are going to introduce in section [ mainidea ] is completely defined when one assigns :    * a symmetry group ( sg ) ( orthogonal , unitary or symplectic ) , corresponding to real symmetric , hermitian or quaternion self - dual matrices ; * a weight function , to be defined in section [ mainidea ] ; * a range for the free parameter @xmath1 .    as far as the sg is concerned , in the present study we will confine ourselves to hermitian ( unitary invariant ) matrices , although generalizations to other sg may be easily derived ( see section [ generalizations ] ) .",
    "the dyson index for this unitary ensemble turns out to be @xmath25 and for this reason we call the ensemble ( @xmath1-unitary ensemble ) .    in sections",
    "[ gaussian ] and [ nongaussian ] we make two different choices for the combination ( weight function @xmath26 range for @xmath1 ) in order to tackle the tasks 1 and 2 described above .",
    "more precisely :    * : choosing as an example a standard gaussian potential , we design a ensemble which is essentially a @xmath18 @xmath2-hermite model @xcite _ plus _ rotational invariance for @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "we compute analytically the marginal distributions of the correlated entries in subsection [ marginal distribution of entries . ] and we derive explicitly the spectral properties in [ subsectionspectral ] .",
    "these results are then checked by numerical diagonalization of actual samples in subsection [ numericalsimulations ] . * : choosing as limiting cases the wigner and the poisson level - spacing profile , we design a ensemble whose level spacing interpolates between the two cases for the parameter @xmath28 $ ] . following the same guidelines , it is in principle possible to extend the analysis to an arbitrary pre - assigned level - spacing profile @xmath29 .    in section [ generalizations ]",
    "we discuss generalizations of this model towards different sg , different weight functions and extended ranges for @xmath1 . at that stage",
    ", we will make comments about some emerging features of our model that appear interesting to be tackled in future researches .",
    "+ in section [ conclusions ] , we first provide a synthetic table with a comparison of the main features of all the ensembles considered in this work , and then we add some concluding remarks .",
    "some technical derivations are also given in the appendices .",
    "let @xmath30\\equiv \\mathbf{p}_\\eta(x_{11},\\ldots , x_{nn})$ ] be the joint probability density of the entries for a @xmath17 random matrix ensemble , depending on the parameter @xmath1 .",

    "we highlight this point by writing hereafter starred quantities ( such as @xmath32 $ ] ) whenever they are meant to be written in terms of traces of powers of @xmath31.[property1 ] 2 .",
    "the jpd of eigenvalues is given by : @xmath33 where the vandermonde term comes from integrating out the ` angular ' variables in the diagonalization @xmath34 .",

    "[ property2 ]    we can specialize the properties [ property1 ] and [ property2 ] to an ensemble of @xmath0 unitary invariant hermitian matrices : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are random variables taken from a jpd @xmath37 and the @xmath38 factors are included for later convenience",

    "the price to pay is that the entries are no longer independent , but get correlated through the multiple trace - trace interaction term @xmath49 .",
    "one may ask whether the crucial identity is just an algebraic accident holding only for @xmath0 matrices or it has a deeper origin .",
    "in fact , turns out to be a special case of the more general identity : @xmath50=\\\\ & = \\left|    \\begin{array}{ccccc }    n & s_1 & s_2 & \\cdots & s_{n-1}\\\\    s_1 & s_2 & s_3 & \\cdots & s_{n}\\\\    s_2 & s_3 & s_4 & \\cdots & s_{n+1}\\\\    \\vdots & \\vdots &   & \\ddots & \\\\",

    "since the vandermonde - squared coupling is a symmetric polynomial in the eigenvalues , it can be represented on the basis of power sums @xcite , which are nothing but traces of higher order powers of @xmath52 .",
    "the representation precisely encodes this change of basis , which is currently used in the context of the fractional quantum hall effect but usually overlooked in rm studies .",
    "note that the general expansion can be used in principle to define a @xmath17 model , although any analytical approach appears very challenging in this case .    from",
    ", it is clear that different choices for the weight function and the range @xmath53 for @xmath1 can be combined to achieve a variety of results . in particular , we are now ready to tackle the first task described in the introduction .",
    "suppose we choose the confining potential to be harmonic @xmath54 .",
    "it is then sufficient to make the simple choices @xmath55 and @xmath27 $ ] to design a @xmath3-hermite model ( @xmath56 $ ] ) @xcite _ plus _ unitary invariance which we are going to solve exactly . before doing that",
    ", we make the following important remark :    unlike in the case of @xmath2-hermite ensemble , the value @xmath57 can be actually reached in for @xmath58 .",

    "the range of variability for @xmath1 is largely arbitrary ( see also subsection [ differentrange ] ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath64 $ ] is motivated by a nice duality between the limiting cases @xmath65 and @xmath58 as in the following table :    .the jpd of entries factorizes for @xmath65 and gives rise to gue ( gaussian unitary ensemble ) with strongly correlated eigenvalues . on the contrary , for @xmath58 the jpd of eigenvalues factorizes and the eigenvalues become i.i.d .",

    "even though the two above cases ( poisson and wigner ) absorb the vast majority of literature on these issues , nevertheless few instances of non - standard gap distributions have been also reported @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "our hope is that the tool we propose here may be used to comprise even these fairly anomalous cases into the universal and otherwise very successful framework of rm theory .",
    "the starting point is the general jpd of eigenvalues : @xmath126 where the superscript @xmath127 recalls that the weight function is still to be determined .",
    "the gap probability for a general weight function can be formally written as : @xmath128 apart from being symmetric in the eigenvalues        , non - negative everywhere and normalizable , the sought @xmath129 should satisfy the following constraints : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a numerical constant is @xmath11 if the spectrum has not been unfolded and @xmath132 in the other case .",
    "however , specifying @xmath131 is not crucial for what follows . ] , in such a way that reduces exactly to poisson for @xmath58 or wigner for @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , the wigner distribution in corresponds to the gap probability for a goe ensemble of @xmath0 _ real _ matrices ( @xmath103 ) and thus has to be realized in for @xmath102 and for a gaussian weight function .",

    "the reader may be puzzled by the non - standard expression and may wonder whether the resulting weight function @xmath129 is indeed expressible in terms of traces of powers of @xmath31 , a fact which is not obvious at first sight .",

    "thus our ensemble smoothly interpolates the tail of the gap distribution between the two known cases , although the full behavior of @xmath155 is different from any previous proposals ( e.g. brody and berry - robnik distributions ) .",

    "hence , one has to be careful in deducing the sg of the ensemble from the exponent of the vandermonde coupling @xmath3 , as this connection may be deceptive . 2 .",
    "using this tool , we have constructed an invariant @xmath0 version of the @xmath2-ensembles of dumitriu and edelman .",
    "this matrix model is completely defined assigning a symmetry group ( orthogonal , unitary , symplectic ) , a weight function and a certain range for @xmath1 : * for the unitary case , with gaussian weight function and @xmath186 , both the marginal distribution of the entries and the spectral properties have been computed analytically and have been tested by numerical sampling of matrices .",
    "the case @xmath63 , corresponding to independent normally distributed eigenvalues , is particularly interesting and can be obtained for @xmath58 .",
    "* for the unitary case , with a generalized bessel weight function and @xmath187 , we generate matrices with a level spacing profile interpolating between poisson and wigner .",
    "both analytical and numerical results have been provided .",
    "3 .   unlike the classical invariant ensembles , our ensembles belonging to different symmetry classes may display the same spectral properties for a suitable range of the free parameter .",
    "we called this curious phenomenon _ spectral twinning _ and we leave a deeper understanding of it as an open problem .",
    "4 .   an extended range for @xmath1 may lead to invariant ensembles whose eigenvalues tend to cluster instead of repelling apart due to a negative dyson index @xmath2 . we are not aware of any previous proposal in this direction , even though this behavior is fairly common in the study of disordered many - body systems .",
    "while generalizations to bigger sizes @xmath188 appear difficult to be tackled analytically , nonetheless the model we presented here displays non - trivial and often surprising features , which make us hope that the proposed technical tool may prove useful in future rm studies .",
