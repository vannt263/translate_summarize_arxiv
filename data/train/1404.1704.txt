    "when setting up a coarse grained model for a polymer or biopolymer it is often useful , if not necessary , to account for its ability to both bend and twist .",
    "a notable example is that of double - stranded dna . a first coarse grained description of dna is to view it as a semi - flexible polymer , or a worm - like chain  @xcite , i.e. a fluctuating elastic rod with a bending rigidity , and an associated persistence length .",
    "the latter gives a measure of the length scale along the polymer backbone over which correlations in the local direction ( the tangent to the backbone ) decay .",
    "for dna in a physiologically realistic salt solution this length is 50 nm , which is significantly larger than its thickness ( 2.5 nm for hydrated b - dna ) .",
    "while a worm - like chain provides a simple and useful description of dna under some conditions  @xcite , it neglects a key elastic property of this biomolecule : its resistance to twisting .",
    "indeed , in reality dna is a double helix which in its relaxed state has a pitch of around 10 base pairs ( in b - dna ) , and over - twisting or under - twisting the helix incurs an energetic penalty  @xcite . twisting dna may also lead to supercoiling  @xcite , i.e. the writhing of a highly twisted filament , which can be witnessed in the everyday world when twisting up an office telephone cord .",
    "supercoiling can be due to over or under - twisting the helical dna , and is accordingly referred to as either positive or negative .",
    "supercoiling is important for dna organisation and function within cells . within bacteria ,",
    "supercoiling helps pack the genome into the tight volume of the cell  @xcite , and hi - c experiments suggest that this phenomenon is also gives rise to the contact maps observed for the bacterial chromosome  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was realised many years ago that supercoiling is naturally and generically created _ in vivo _",
    "@xcite : as an rna polymerase transcribes a gene , it generates an excess of twist ahead , and a deficit behind , and this leads to , respectively , positively and negatively supercoiled domains ( a brownian dynamics simulation exploring the biophysics of this phenomenon was provided in  @xcite ) .",
    "supercoiling is also thought to play a functional role in gene regulation  @xcite and transcription  @xcite in eukaryotes .",
    "this is because , among other things , as the dna wraps around histones to make chromatin , each wrapping adds two units of writhe into the polymer : the interplay of this writhe with the transcriptionally - driven supercoiling just discussed could help open up the chromatin fibre as it is transcribed ( or replicated )  @xcite .",
    "the importance of supercoiling to intracellular dna is also apparent from the number of key enzymes whose role is to regulate it , such as dna gyrases , which induce negative supercoiling , and topoisomerases , which are often employed to relieve it  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore vital for coarse grained simulations of bacterial and eukaryotic dna , or of naked dna loops , to be able to treat twist and twist fluctuations accurately . the simplest way to achieve",
    "this is to endow the model dna with a twist rigidity as well as a bending rigidity  @xcite .",
    "just as the bending rigidity leads to a non - zero persistence length which characterises how correlations in the backbone directions decay due to bending , the twist rigidity leads to a twist persistence length , which characterises how twist correlations decay , or , equivalently , how big twist fluctuations should be at a given temperature @xmath0 .",
    "this twist persistence length is of the same order of , and slightly larger than , the bending persistence length , and typical estimates are between 60 and 75 nm  @xcite .",
    "there are many excellent papers in the literature which discuss how to set up a model of a twistable worm - like chain to study the dynamics of dna when supercoiling is important  @xcite .",
    "most of the brownian dynamics simulation work on coarse grained ( bead - and - spring ) dna molecules with twisting and supercoiling build on the seminal contributions in refs .",
    "however , most modern , widely - used molecular dynamics codes , such as lammps  @xcite , do not currently incorporate this force field in their source code . furthermore , in the literature there have been a variety of approaches to study twistable elastic chains , and to our knowledge there has not been a systematic analysis of the possible hamiltonians , and the relation between them and with the available continuum theories .",
    "thus our goal in this work is to fill this gap and provide a detailed description of possible coarse grained hamiltonians for twistable worm - like chains , suitable for use in brownian or langevin dynamics simulations .",
    "we also derive formulas for the tangent - tangent and for the twist correlation functions , and describe several possible implementations of these models in lammps .",
    "our work is structured as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will review the continuum theory of elastic rods . in sec .",
    "iii , we discretise the continuum energy and show that the model in ref .  @xcite provides a valid discretisation , as do other equally valid options which are formulated using appropriate combinations of dihedral potentials .",
    "section iv contains an analytical calculation of the persistence lengths in the discrete model , together with a comparison with numerical data .",
    "section v provides a detailed description of the implementation of some of the models introduced in sec .",
    "iii in lammps , and then in sec .",
    "vi we compare the some simulations results with the theory . finally , in sec .",
    "vii we draw some conclusions , and point to some possible ways in which the current work may be applied to dna biophysics .",

[ continuous ] has been formulated for a linear rod with unconstrained ends . several previous studies  @xcite have focused on supercoiled dna by considering a rod stretched between two substrates ; there the rod is parametrised by the deviation of its configuration from a reference relaxed molecule , an extra stretching term is included in the energy , and a constraint of constant linking number is imposed .",
    "that description suffers from a pathology in the continuum limit which arises because twisting a constrained rod will lead to writhing , and , unless self - avoidance is accounted for , it is possible for loops to form and the rod to pass through itself ( this manifests as a singularity in the constant linking number hamiltonian , and is related to the analogous system of a quantum mechanical symmetric top  @xcite ) .",
    "this problem does not arise in our analytical treatment , because we do not need to employ any approximate formulas for writhe and linking number , as we do not include supercoiling ( since the ends of the rod are not constrained ) .",
    "a similar pathology appears in the case where the energy includes a term in the geometric normal @xmath4 ( defined in sec .",
    "[ continuous ] ) instead of the material normal @xmath11  @xcite , which gives rise to complex eigenvalues of the transfer matrix ; this results in the tangent - tangent correlations decaying in an oscillatory way , with the oscillation period becoming singular in the continuum limit .",
    "we do not encounter this problem in the present work , since the energy in eq .",
    "( [ ediscreteeq ] ) leads to a transfer matrix [ eq .",
    "( [ transfer_mean ] ) ] with real eigenvalues .",
    "the main contribution of our work is that we have provided a detailed implementation of the model of refs .",
    "@xcite in lammps  @xcite , a very well used code to simulate brownian dynamics .",
    "the associated code , which is available on request , allows the inclusion of hamiltonians defined in terms of euler angles , and we expect it will be of use in the future to perform large scale and parallel coarse grained simulations of dna and of other polymers or fibres where twist , as well as twist fluctuations , play a major role in the physics ( for some examples , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in particular , one may use the implementation we have described to study the dynamics and physics of confined supercoiled dna , which is a good starting point to describe bacterial dna ; it would also be possible , for instance , to model supercoiling in chromatin fibres and chromosome fragments , to begin understanding its role in gene regulation .",
    "the advantage of the approach we are proposing here is that , thanks to the high scalability of lammps , these simulations can reach unprecedented large scale with respect to previous simulations of coarse grained supercoiled dna presented .",
    "we acknowledge epsrc grants ep / i034661/1 and ep / i004262/1 for funding .",
    "here we present an approximate but intuitive way of calculating the correlation functions associated with bending and twisting of an elastic rod .",
