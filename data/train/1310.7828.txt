    "the ( propositional ) planning problem has been the subject of intensive study in knowledge representation , artificial intelligence and control theory and is relevant for a large number of industrial applications  @xcite .",
    "the problem involves deciding whether an _ initial state_an @xmath0-vector over some domain @xmath1can be transformed into a _ goal state _ via the application of _ actions _ ( or _ operators _ ) each consisting of _ preconditions _ and _ post - conditions _ ( or _ effects _ ) stating the conditions that need to hold before the action can be applied and which conditions will hold after the application of the action , respectively .",
    "it is known that the problem of deciding whether a solution exists or not is -complete  @xcite .",
    "although various -complete and even tractable restrictions are known in the literature @xcite these are often considered not to coincide well with cases that are intersting in practice . in the authors",
    "experience , classical complexity analysis is often too coarse to give relevant results for planning , since most interesting restrictions seem to remain -complete . despite this",
    ", there has been very few attempts to use alternative analysis methods .",
    "the few exceptions include probabilistic analysis  @xcite , approximation  @xcite and padding  @xcite .",
    "another obvious alternative is to use the framework of parameterized complexity which offers the more relaxed notion of _ fixed - parameter tractability _ ( fpt ) .",
    "a problem is fixed - parameter tractable if it can be solved in time @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an arbitrary function of the parameter @xmath4 ( which measures some aspect of the input ) and @xmath0 is the input size .",
    "indeed , already in a 1999 paper , downey , fellows and stege @xcite initiated the parameterized analysis of planning , taking the minimum number of steps from the initial state to the goal state ( i.e. , the length of the solution plan ) as the parameter .",
    "however , the parameterized viewpoint did not immediately gain momentum for analysis of planning and it is only during the last few years that we have witnessed a strongly increased interest in this method , cf .",
    "@xcite .    in this article",
    ", we use the same parameter as downey et al . and provide a complete analysis of planning under various syntactical restrictions , in particular the restrictions considered by bylander  @xcite and by bckstrm and nebel  @xcite .",
    "these were among the first attempts to understand why and when planning is hard or easy and they have had a heavy influence on later theoretical research in planning .",
    "we complement these results by also considering bounds on problem kernels for those planning problems that we prove to be fixed - parameter tractable .",
    "it is known that a decidable problem is fixed - parameter tractable if and only if it admits a polynomial - time self - reduction where the size of the resulting instance is bounded by a function  @xmath3 of the parameter  @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath3 is called the _ kernel size_. by providing upper and lower bounds on the kernel size , one can rigorously establish the potential of polynomial - time preprocessing for the problem at hand .",
    "we provide a full parameterized complexity analysis of planning with respect to the length of the solution plan , under all combinations of the syntactical p , u , b , and s restrictions previously considered by bckstrm and nebel  @xcite as well as under the restrictions on the number of preconditions and effects previously considered by bylander  @xcite .",
    "our new parameterized results are summarized in table  [ table : bylander ] and figure  [ fig : pubs - lattice ] alongside the previously reported classical complexity results .",
    "we discuss our results more thoroughly in section  [ sec : class ] .",
    "in addition , we examine whether the fixed - parameter tractable subcases , which we obtain , admit polynomial kernels or not .",
    "our results on this are negative throughout  if any of these problems admit polynomial kernels , or even polynomial bi - kernels , then @xmath5 and the polynomial - time hierarchy collapses .",
    "the rest of the paper is laid out as follows .",
    "section 2 defines some concepts of parameterized complexity theory and section 3 defines the sas@xmath6  and strips  planning languages .",
    "the hardness results are collected in section 4 and the membership results in section 5 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to our tractability results and in section 7 we show that none of the tractable subcases admits a polynomial kernel .",
    "we summarize the results of the paper in section 8 and discuss some observations and consequences .",

    "this work opens up several new research directions .",
    "we briefly discuss some of them below .",
    "the use of parameterized analysis in planning is by no means restricted to using plan length as parameter .",
    "for instance , very recently kronegger et  al .",
    "@xcite obtained parameterized results for several different parameters and combinations of them : one should note that the parameter need not be a single value , it can be a combination of two or more ` basic ' parameters .",
    "a second example is considered by downey et al .",
    "@xcite . they show that strips  planning can be recast as the signed digraph pebbling problem which is modeled as a special type of graph .",
    "they analyze the parameterized complexity of this problem considering also the treewidth of the graph as a parameter .",
    "a final example is the recent paper by de haan et al .",
    "@xcite who study the parameterized complexity of plan reuse , where the task is to modify an existing plan to obtain the solution for new planning instance by making a small modification .",
    "our observation that restriction u makes planning easier under parameterized analysis is interesting in the context of the literature on planning .",
    "although this case remains -complete under classical complexity analysis , it has been repeatedly stressed in the literature that unary actions are interesting for reasons of efficiency .",
    "for instance , williams and nayak  @xcite considered planning for spacecrafts and found that unary actions were often sufficient to model real - world problems in this domain .",
    "they noted that one consequence of having only unary actions is that the causal graph for a planning instance must be acyclic , a property which has often been exploited in the literature , both for theoretical results on planning complexity for various strucutures of the causal graph @xcite as well as for practical planning  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is a result on causal graphs in general by chen and gimnez @xcite .",
    "it is a classical complexity result that is proven under an assumption from parameterized complexity .",
    "there are also close ties between model checking and planning and this connection deserves further study .",
    "for instance , model - checking traces can be viewed as plans and vice versa  @xcite , and methods and results have been transferred between the two areas in both directions @xcite .",
    "our reductions from planning to model - checking suggest that the problems are related also on a more fundamental level than just straightforward syntactical translations .",
    "the major motivation for our research is the need for alternative and complementary methods in complexity analysis of planning .",
    "however , planning is also an interesting problem per se .",
    "it is a very powerful modelling language since it is -complete in the general case , while it is also often simple to model other problems as planning problems . for instance , it would be interesting to identify various restrictions that make planning -complete but still allow for straightforward modelling of many common -complete problems , and analogously for other classes than .    like most other results on complexity analysis of planning in the literature ,",
    "our results apply to various restrictions of the actual planning language .",
    "however , the commonly studied language restrictions usually do not match the restrictions implied by applications .",
    "a complementary approach is thus to study the complexity of common benchmark problems for planning , e.g. the blocks world  @xcite and the problems used in the international planning competitions  @xcite .",
    "hence , it would be interesting to apply parameterized complexity analysis to these problems to see if it could help to explain the empirical results on which problems are hard and easy in practice . finding the right parameter(s ) would , of course , be crucial for achieving relevant results on this .",

    "<S> problem is a notoriously difficult computational problem , which remains hard even under strong syntactical and structural restrictions . given its difficulty it becomes natural to study planning in the context of parameterized complexity . </S>",

    "<S> we provide a complete classification of the parameterized complexity of the planning problem under two of the most prominent syntactical restrictions , i.e. , the so called pubs restrictions introduced by bckstrm and nebel and restrictions on the number of preconditions and effects as introduced by bylander . </S>",
    "<S> we also determine which of the considered fixed - parameter tractable problems admit a polynomial kernel and which do nt . </S>"
