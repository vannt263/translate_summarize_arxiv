    "one of the main goals of the high energy heavy - ion collision experiments is to study the various aspects of the qcd phase diagram  @xcite . with this purpose",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has finished the first phase of the beam energy scan ( bes ) program  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the bes program was to look for changes in observation of various measurements as a function of beam energy to establish transition region between the partonic and/or hadronic dominant interactions in the qcd phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "+ the elliptic flow parameter @xmath0 is a good tool for studying the system formed in the early stages of high energy collisions at rhic  @xcite .",
    "it describes the azimuthal momentum anisotropy of particle emission in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is defined as the second harmonic coefficient of the azimuthal fourier decomposition of the momentum distribution with respect to the reaction plane angle ( @xmath5 ) and can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath1 is emission azimuthal angle  @xcite .",
    "according to hydrodynamical description @xmath0 is an early time phenomenon and sensitive to the equation of state of the system formed in the collision  @xcite .",
    "the results from relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) on @xmath7 as a function of transverse momentum ( @xmath8 ) shows that at low @xmath8 elliptic flow of identified hadrons follows mass ordering ( lower @xmath0 for heavier hadrons than that of lighter hadrons ) whereas at intermediate @xmath8 all mesons and all baryons form two different groups .",
    "when @xmath0 and @xmath8 are scaled by number of constituent quarks of the hadrons , the measured @xmath0 values are consistent with each other as the parton coalescence or recombination models predicted  @xcite .",
    "this observation , is known as number of constituents quark scaling ( ncq scaling ) .",
    "this effect has been interpreted as collectivity being developed at the partonic stage of the evolution of the system in heavy - ion collision  @xcite .",
    "+ although the parton coalescence or recombination model can successfully explain the observed quark scaling in experimental data but one can not say that only ncq scaling of identified hadrons  @xcite is sufficient signature for the formation of de - confined matter .",
    "the study of ncq scaling of identified hadrons from urqmd model shows that the pure hadronic medium can also reproduced such scaling in @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "this is due to modification of initially developed @xmath0 by later stage hadronic interactions  @xcite .",
    "so the @xmath9 of those particles which do not interact with hadronic interaction will be the clean and good probe for early dynamics in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the @xmath1 meson , which is the bound state of @xmath10 and @xmath11 quark , has small interaction cross - section with other hadrons  @xcite and freezes out early  @xcite . due to small hadronic interaction cross - section ,",
    "@xmath1-mesons @xmath0 are almost unaffected by later stage interaction and it will have negligible value if @xmath1 mesons are not produced via @xmath10 and @xmath11 quark coalescence  @xcite . therefore , it is very important to study the @xmath1-meson @xmath0 in bes program at rhic .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in the section , ampt model has been briefly discussed .",
    "section describe the comparison of experimentally measured @xmath1-meson @xmath0 with the corresponding results from the ampt model ( version 1.11 ) .",
    "finally the summary and conclusion has been discussed in section .",
    "the ampt model , which is a hybrid transport model , has four main stages : the initial conditions , partonic interactions , the conversion from the partonic to the hadronic matter , and hadronic interactions  @xcite .",
    "it uses the same initial conditions from hijing  @xcite .",
    "scattering among partons are modelled by zhang s parton cascade  @xcite , which calculates two - body parton scatterings using cross sections from pqcd with screening masses . in the default ampt model",
    ", partons are recombined with their parent strings and when they stop interacting , the resulting strings fragment into hadrons according to the lund string fragmentation model  @xcite .",
    "however in the string melting scenario ( labeled as ampt - sm ) , these strings are converted to soft partons and a quark coalescence model is used to combine parton into hadrons .",
    "the evolution dynamics of the hadronic matter is described by a relativistic transport ( art ) model .",
    "the interactions between the minijet partons in the ampt default model and those between partons in the ampt - sm could give rise to substantial @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , agreement between the data and the results from ampt - sm would indicate the contribution of partonic interactions to the measured @xmath9 .",
    "the parton - parton interaction cross section in the string - melting version of the ampt is taken to be 3 mb and 10 mb . in this study , approximately 1.5 million events for each configuration were generated for minimum - bias au+au collisions .",
    "in this section , the @xmath1-meson @xmath0 measured by star experiment at mid - rapidity ( @xmath12 1.0 ) for @xmath2 = 7.7 - 200 gev  @xcite has been compared with ampt model .",
    "@xmath1 mesons are identified from the @xmath13 and @xmath14 decay channel , the same method as used in experimental analysis .",
    "+      figure  [ v2_pt ] shows the comparison of elliptic flow of @xmath1 mesons in 0 - 80@xmath15 minimum - bias au+au collisions at mid - rapidity ( @xmath12 1.0 ) for @xmath2 = 7.7 , 11.5 , 19.6 , 27 , 39 and 62.4 gev with the corresponding results from the ampt model  @xcite .",
    "the measured data points are compared with both ampt string melting ( 3 mb and 10 mb parton - parton cross - section ) and ampt default version . at @xmath2 = 62.4 gev experimental data",
    "are in a good agreement with ampt string melting model with 10 mb parton - parton cross - section .",
    "this is also true for @xmath2 = 200 gev as reported in ref .",
    "the measured @xmath1 @xmath0 , for @xmath16 gev / c , lie between 3 mb and 10 mb for the energy range @xmath17 @xmath4 @xmath2 @xmath4 39 gev , but in order to explain the measurements for @xmath18 gev / c , a parton - parton cross - section of the oder of 10 mb is required .",
    "none of the above model can explain the trend of @xmath1-mesons @xmath0 at @xmath2 = 7.7 and 11.5 gev where the event statistics for data is also small . as we expect that the @xmath1-meson @xmath0 mostly reflect the collectivity from the partonic phase ,",
    "therefore from the comparison of experimental data with ampt model one can conclude that the partonic collectivity has been developed for @xmath2 @xmath3 19.6 gev at rhic .",
    "whereas the contribution from the partonic collectivity to the final collectivity seems negligible at @xmath2 @xmath4 11.5 gev .",

    "this tells that there is a substantial contribution of partonic collectivity to the final collectivity for @xmath2 @xmath3 19.6 gev .",

    "the comparison of the experimental data on the beam energy dependence of the average elliptic flow of @xmath1 meson with the corresponding results from a transport model calculation with varying parton - parton cross section suggests that the partonic contribution to the collectivity decreases and possibly the value of the @xmath39/@xmath10 of the system increases as the beam energy decreases .",
