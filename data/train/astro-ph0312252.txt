    "the current state - of - the - art in radial velocity precision did not come easily : it is the result of years of dedicated effort by numerous groups to develop the optimal instrumental methods , prior to the announcement of the first successful detections . by analogy ,",
    "dozens of research groups are now exploring novel techniques to follow - up and characterize these newly - detected planets . many of these methods were considered completely unrealistic prior to discovery of the great diversity of planetary systems , when only our own solar system served as a guide .",
    "notably , several techniques have been fueled by the detection of gas giants that are either significantly more massive , or closer to the central star , than any object in our solar system .",
    "i describe here the current sensitivity of several of these techniques , discussing wherever possible published data , and the corresponding upper limits and/or detections .",
    "i provide an extensive reference list so that this paper may also serve as gateway for individuals new to the field : such studies will likely require many teams and years of development to find the optimal observing strategy .",
    "benedict et al . ( 2002 ) report the first astrometrically determined mass of an extrasolar planet : capitalizing on the high - precision astrometry enabled by the hst fine guidance sensors , they have detected the astrometric motion of the gj  876 due to its outer orbiting planet ( gj  876  b , @xmath0  d ; the inner planet , gj  876  c , has a period of @xmath1  d ) .",
    "combining the astrometry with the radial velocity measurements , they solve for the perturbation semi - major axis @xmath2  mas , inclination @xmath3 , as well as the gj  876 absolute parallax , @xmath4  mas . since the system is very close to edge on , the planetary mass they determine , @xmath5 , is indeed the minimum mass derived from radial velocities alone .",
    "the high inclination indicates that the one or both of the planets may indeed lie in a transiting configuration .",

    "planets shine in reflected light with a flux ( relative to their stars ) of @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the semi - major axis , @xmath21 is the geometric albedo , and @xmath22 is the phase function ( the flux from the planet when viewed at a phase angle @xmath23 relative to the flux received when the planet is at opposition ) .",
    "the system can thus be pictured as an extreme double - lined spectroscopic binary : the secondary spectrum is exceptionally faint ( @xmath24 ) , but very well separated spectroscopically , as the orbital velocities for these hot jupiters are typically of order @xmath25 , much greater than the typical stellar line widths of @xmath26 .",
    "the challenge is to detect the secondary spectrum , and thus derive the planetary mass ( from the projected velocity separation of the planet and star ) , as well as estimates of the geometric albedo and planetary radius .",

    "the hd  209458 system ( @xmath55  d , @xmath56 ) would require longer integration times due to its faintness ( @xmath57 ) , yet the interpretation of such data would be greatly simplified : since the orbital inclination ( @xmath58 ) and planetary radius ( @xmath59 ) are known , the geometric albedo can be estimated unambiguously from the flux ratio .",
    "a more direct method to study the albedo and scattered light curves of hot jupiters is ultra - high precision photometry capable of measuring the photometric modulation that results from the varying illumination of the planet as it orbits the central star .",
    "ground - based efforts to detect the reflected - light modulation from extrasolar planets are typically limited by atmospheric extinction effects to a precision of 0.1% ( see kenworthy & hinz 2003 for a description of such an effort ) .",

    "the most satellite ( matthews et al . 2000 ; walker et al . 2003 ) was launched 30 june 2003 , and possesses just such a capability : although its primary science goal is the detection and characterization of rapid acoustic oscillations in sun - like stars ( @xmath60  mhz ) , it should have the precision to detect the variation caused by several known hot jupiters ( @xmath61  mhz ) .",
    "most conducts photometry in a single bandpass ( @xmath62  nm ) and thus will provide no spectral information .",

    "the primary detectability determinant ( other than the model of the planetary atmosphere ) is the stellar rotation period , although stellar brightness is significant for @xmath65 . the upcoming cnes corot mission ( schneider et al .",

    "i do not discuss here the numerous efforts to detect unknown extrasolar planets by the transit method ( for a review , see horne 2003 and charbonneau 2003a ) .",

    "is frustrated by a significant degeneracy , as it is possible to fit the data by a family of models wherein the ratio @xmath66 is preserved .",
    "the typical resulting uncertainty in the planetary radius as derived from these ground - based data sets is 10% .",
    "in contrast to this situation , brown et al .",
    "( 2001 ) observed four transits with hst / stis , and achieved a precision of 0.1  mmag and a rapid cadence of 80  s. these data constrained the slope and duration of ingress and egress with sufficient quality to break the above degeneracy .",

    "they also ruled out the presence of planetary satellites larger than 1.2  @xmath73 ( based on photometric residuals ) or more massive than 3  @xmath73 ( based on timing residuals ) , and placed constraints on the presence of opaque circumplanetary rings .",
    "schultz et al . ( 2003 ) observed several transits with the hst fine guidance sensors , which yielded an ultra - rapid cadence of 0.025  s , and a typical signal - to - noise ratio of 80 .",

    "( 2001 ) and schultz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) data sets , each of which permit an accurate determination of the time of center of transit , yields an extremely precise value of the orbital period .",

    "2002a , b ; konacki et al .",
    "the period deduced from recent doppler observations of the system ( torres et al .",
    "2003 ) confirms that found from the photometric data , and the amplitude of the doppler shift demonstrates that the companion is indeed of planetary mass .",
    "the precision of the radial velocity observations is relatively coarse ( typically 100  m@xmath74 , due to the much fainter magnitude of the star than those typically surveyed ) .",
    "the best estimates of the planetary radius , @xmath75 , and mass , @xmath76 , imply a much greater density @xmath77 than that of hd  209458  b. the semi - major axis of ogle - tr-56  b ( 0.0225  au ) is less than half that of hd  209458  b ( 0.0468  au ) , and thus comparison of these objects may offer us insight into the importance of insolation upon the planetary radius .",

    "they rule out alternate explanations of this dimming ( such as stellar limb darkening ) , and conclude that the effect is due to absorption in the planetary atmosphere .",
    "the signal amplitude is roughly 1/3 that predicted from model atmospheres that are cloudless and contain a solar abundance of sodium in atomic form .",
    "a possible explanation for this decrement is the presence of a high - altitude cloud deck ( with cloud tops above 0.4  mbar ) .",
    "an alternative reason is the depletion of atomic sodium , either as a result of chemical reaction into molecules such as nacl and na@xmath79s , or indicative of a global metal abundance that is significantly reduced relative to solar .",

    "they found a transit depth of @xmath80  % , corresponding to an equivalent size of 4.3  @xmath81 .",
    "as this is in excess of the roche limit of 3.6  @xmath81 , they conclude that some hydrogen atoms must be escaping from the planet ( there is also some independent spectral evidence that the atoms have a large velocity relative to the planet ) .",
    "although the minimum escape rate required by the data would reduce the planetary mass by only a negligible amount ( 0.1% ) when integrated over the age of the system , significantly higher mass - loss rates are also permitted .",
    "there have been several ground - based efforts to detect additional atmospheric features in absorption , all of which have been frustrated by variability in the telluric spectrum and the spectrograph .",

    "richardson et al . ( 2003a , b ) have presented strong limits on the infrared spectrum of hd  209458  b. their method of `` occultation spectroscopy '' capitalizes on the transiting geometry to search for the disappearance and reappearance of spectral features at the times of ingress and egress .",

    "they are not , however , sensitive to all reasonable models of the planetary atmosphere : in particular , cloudy models ( as favored by the small amplitude of the sodium feature detected by transmission spectroscopy ; charbonneau et al .",
    "2002 ) would yield substantially weaker features which would be below their detection threshold .",

    "they are able to rule out cloudless models in which there is a strong day - night temperature asymmetry , as such models yield a steep temperature - pressure profile to which their experiment is most sensitive .",
    "the secondary eclipse need not occur exactly half a period after the primary eclipse .",
    "the current upper limit on the orbital eccentricity , @xmath93 ( g. marcy , personal communication ) is indeed consistent with zero ( as expected from tidal circularization ) , but could conceivably be as high as @xmath94 .",
    "an eccentricity of @xmath95 could shift the time of secondary eclipse by as much as 2  hours ( depending on the longitude of periastron @xmath96 ; see charbonneau 2003b for details ) .",
    "the detection of a significant offset would place a lower limit on the eccentricity ( and the radial velocity measurements provide an upper bound ) .",
    "conversely , upper limits on the offset would provide even more stringent constraints upon the eccentricity , and thus bear upon the mechanisms that compete to pump and damp the orbital eccentricity .",
    "thus , experiments that attempt to detect the secondary eclipse must account for the additional complication that the event may shifted by as much as 2  hours , but this possibility also provides us with a additional tool with which to study the planet and its orbit .",
    "cuntz , saar & musielak ( 2000 ) investigate several possible interactions between extrasolar planets and their parent stars that may result in stellar chromospheric and coronal activity enhancement .",
    "these effects will be due predominantly to a combination of tidal and magnetic effects .",
    "the origin of any observed activity could be distinguished observationally , since tidal effects should reveal a periodicity of @xmath97 ( where @xmath98 is the planetary orbital period ) , whereas magnetic effects should follow a period of @xmath98 .",

    "the group is monitoring 51  peg , but has seen no clear evidence for variability .",
    "even before the doppler detections of numerous extrasolar planets , searches for long - wavelength radio emission from planets orbiting neighboring stars had been carried out ( wingleee , dulk & bastian 1986 ) .",
    "such searches are motivated by the observation that the polar regions of all of the solar system gas giants are the sites of intense auroral - related radio emission .",

    "several scaling laws have been proposed to relate the approximate radio power for the planets of the solar system .",
    "these `` radiometric bode s laws '' suggest that the radiated power scales directly with the planetary mass , and inversely with the three - halves power of the semi - major axis , @xmath108 .",
    "since we now know of several nearby sun - like stars that are host to jupiter - mass planets at a distance of 0.05  au , the scaling laws from the solar system suggest that the radio emission from these objects could exceed jupiter by a factor of 1000 ( see discussion in farrell et al .",

    "the detection of cyclotron radio emission from extrasolar planets would be a valuable tool ( e.g. bastian et al .",
    "2000 ) : it would permit the characterization of the planetary magnetic field , and the upper limit on the emission frequency would yield the maximum strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the sense of circular polarization might indicate from which pole the emission originated , and the elliptical polarization might yield a limit on the plasma density in the planetary magnetosphere .",
    "furthermore , the periodicity of the radio emission would give a direct determination of the rotational period ( indeed , the rotation periods for the solar system gas giants are determined by this method , not by the observation of atmospheric features , which rotate differentially ) .",
    "additional periodicities in the emission might indicate the presence of planetary satellites , again by analogy with the planets of the solar system .",
    "farrell et al . ( 2003 ) identified the hot jupiter system @xmath27  boo ( @xmath109 ) as the optimal target , as the scaling favors massive planets at small orbital separations . at a distance of 10  pc , the radio power from jupiter",
    "would be approximately 0.023  mjy .",

    "bastian et al . ( 2000 ) have conducted vla observations of seven extrasolar planets ( 51  peg , @xmath18  and , @xmath111  cnc , 47  uma , @xmath27  boo , 70  vir , and hd  114762 ) at 333  mhz and 1465  mhz , where the sensitivities are greater , but the predicted signals are much weaker .",
    "their typical 1-@xmath15 sensitivities were @xmath112  mjy at 333  mhz , and @xmath113  mjy at 1465  mhz .",
    "they state upper limits for each system .",
    "they also observed the 47  uma system ( @xmath114 , @xmath115  d ) , at 74  mhz with a sensitivity of 50  mjy , but did not detect a signal .",
    "a weaker signal is expected for 47  uma than for the hot jupiter system @xmath27  boo , due to the much larger semi - major axis .",
