    "the voronoi summation formulas for @xmath3 and @xmath0 have had numerous applications to problems in analytic number theory , perhaps most notably to recent subconvexity results ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the formulas provide an identity between sums of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 are fourier coefficients of the automorphic form , @xmath6 , @xmath7 an exponential sum , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 a pair of test functions related by an integral transformation .",
    "indeed , such a rubric covers the poisson summation formula , itself a cornerstone tool in analytic number theory . for @xmath3",
    "the exponential sum is a single exponential , whereas for @xmath0 it is a kloosterman sum .",
    "one way to prove the @xmath3 formula is to use mellin inversion of the functional equation of the standard @xmath2-function with twists .",
    "an analytic variant of this method , carried out by duke - iwaniec @xcite , involves an @xmath10-dimensional hyperkloosterman sum .",
    "that could be regarded as predicting the appearance of a hyperkloosterman sum in the voronoi formula for @xmath1 .",
    "however , the mellin - inversion approach quickly runs into computational difficulties .",
    "the argument that we follow here closely follows the one in @xcite , except that it is done for general @xmath1 , and not just @xmath11 as was the case there .",
    "in particular , all of the analytic details necessary to justify that formula are essentially covered in @xcite , though the formal aspects of the computation   while philosophically identical   are more involved , of course .",
    "we first execute the computation in classical terms , entirely analogously to the @xmath0 argument in @xcite , and then later perform the computation adelically .",
    "the latter has the advantage of providing a formula for general congruence groups .",
    "fourier coefficients of automorphic forms on @xmath1 are indexed by @xmath12-tuples @xmath13 ; for a cusp form , the coefficients vanish unless @xmath14 . for full level hecke cusp forms ,",
    "the coefficients are uniquely determined by the @xmath2-function coefficients @xmath15 , or dually , by the coefficients @xmath16 .",
    "that is a consequence of fairly complicated hecke relations .",
    "however , the voronoi formulas we state hold even for non - hecke eigenforms , and our proof does not require the hecke property .",
    "when the full - level assumption is dropped , there are more fourier coefficients to take into account . for @xmath3",
    "this is explained by the jacquet - langlands and atkin - lehner theory , but in the absence of a satisfactory theory of this type for @xmath1 , one can not at present pin down the general fourier coefficients for @xmath1 in terms of the @xmath2-function coefficients .",
    "thus we state the formulas for full level , although our second , adelic proof produces a general formula once one has further information of atkin - lehner type .",
    "we say that @xmath17 is the representation parameter of a cusp form on @xmath1 if its archimedean component embeds    the casselman embedding theorem @xcite guarantees that such an embedding exists .    into the principal series representation @xmath18",
    "we do not assume that the archimedean component is a full principal series representation ; in particular , it need not belong to the spherical principal series .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 may not be uniquely determined by the archimedean component :  indeed , when the archimedean component is an irreducible principal series representation , the @xmath19 can be ( simultaneously ) freely permuted , a fact which provides useful flexibility in the range of test functions allowed in the voronoi formula . except for that flexibility , our formula is independent of the parameters up to permutation , as will be clear from its statement below .",
    "another ingredient of the voronoi formula is the integral transform relating the two test functions ; in the prototypical example of the poisson summation formula the fourier transform plays that role .",
    "we shall give two descriptions here , entirely analogous to those in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first is more concise but somewhat symbolic , in that it needs to be interpreted carefully to have meaning .",
    "let @xmath20 , and suppose that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the space of schwartz functions on the real line .",
    "the transform @xmath9 of @xmath8 is then defined as @xmath23 with an inversion formula that involves replacing the @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "evidently this formula can be regarded as a generalization of the fourier transform . for details on how the formula needs to be interpreted",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the second , equivalent description of the transform @xmath26 relates the signed mellin transform @xmath27 of @xmath28 to that of @xmath29 : @xmath30 here @xmath31 , with @xmath32 , denotes the gamma factor @xmath33 that was introduced in @xcite .",
    "one can reconstruct the odd and even components of @xmath9 from the formula ( [ mfmf ] ) by means of the signed mellin inversion formula @xmath34 this latter description of the transform @xmath35 is less suggestive than ( [ ffromf ] ) , but more useful in applications .",
    "one can argue as in @xcite that @xmath36 in the singular cases where two or more of the @xmath24 differ by an integer , the above formula must be interpreted as including powers of @xmath37 ",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "it is important to note that this only affects the asymptotics of the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 near zero , a point at which they are never directly evaluated in our formula below .",
    "we had remarked that the components @xmath38 of the parameter @xmath39 are freely permutable when the archimedean representation is an irreducible principal series representation . in that situation",
    "we can replace @xmath40 on the left hand side of ( [ mfmf1 ] ) by @xmath41 , and then sum over @xmath42 . that makes the hypotheses on the test functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 completely symmetric .",
    "the @xmath1 summation formula requires one more ingredient , the @xmath12-dimensional hyperkloosterman sum @xmath43 where @xmath44 is shorthand for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , for @xmath47 , denotes the reciprocal of @xmath48 modulo @xmath49 .",
    "the sum is used only when @xmath50 divides @xmath51 for each @xmath52 .",
    "[ mainthm ] under the assumptions on a cusp form for @xmath53 stated above , with fixed values of @xmath54 and relatively prime @xmath55 , @xmath56    a voronoi summation formula for @xmath1 appears in goldfeld - li @xcite .",
    "our formula precedes the goldfeld - li formula ; see @xcite .",
    "it is also more general in two respects : it applies not only to spherical principal series representations , and involves summation over the fourier coefficients @xmath57 for arbitrary nonzero @xmath58 , not with @xmath59 as in @xcite .",
    "the freedom to specify arbitrary non - zero @xmath60 is potentially important ; in the case of @xmath0 , for example , li s convexity breaking result @xcite crucially depends on this additional freedom .",
    "theorem ( [ mainthm ] ) applies to cusp forms .",
    "ivic @xcite proves and uses a voronoi formula for multiple divisor functions , which corresponds to non - cusp forms .",
    "his proof uses poisson summation .",
    "in fact , voronoi formulas for noncusp forms can always be derived using the formulas for cusp forms on smaller groups , though this procedure may be complicated because of their nonzero constant terms .",
    "one application of our formula is to give a new proof of the functional equation for the standard @xmath2-function of a cusp form for @xmath53 , and more generally those twisted by dirichlet characters .",
    "this was carried out in @xcite for @xmath61 by a general argument , an argument that also applies to our situation here , as we shall argue presently .",
    "the key point is that our voronoi formula can be applied to the test functions @xmath62 even though they do not satisfy the hypotheses of the theorem as stated .",
    "they can , because of a deeper analytic fact :  the relevant automorphic distributions in section  [ sec : background ] vanish to infinite order at 0 and @xmath63 in the sense of @xcite ( see proposition  [ fliprelationsprop ] below ) .",
    "the proof of this vanishing to infinite order involves arguments related to the main mechanism of proof in the paper @xcite of casselman - hecht - milii . in effect , certain fourier components of automorphic distributions are completely determined , as distributions , by their restriction to an open schubert cell , just as is the case for whittaker distributions in their paper .",
    "we could have relied on their result , but have chosen to develop the necessary tools ourselves in section [ sec : inforder ] , for the following reasons .",
    "our tools are both stronger and more concrete than the corresponding arguments in @xcite , and we expect to use them in the future , in situations not covered by @xcite . in fact , we prove a slightly more general version of an important lemma  lemma  [ inforderlem3 ] below  than we need for the proof of the voronoi formula . this more general version , which we also expect to use in the future , can not be reduced to the whittaker case .",
    "we now consider the formula in theorem  [ mainthm ] with the choice of functions ( [ fpower ] ) , taking @xmath60 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 to be positive   as we may , because the coefficient @xmath66 is insensitive to the signs of the entries of @xmath67 .",
    "that results in a general functional equation for additively twisted @xmath2-functions : @xmath68 or , in the special case of @xmath69 , more simply @xmath70 now let @xmath71 be a primitive dirichlet character modulo @xmath65 , such that @xmath72 .",
    "a basic identity asserts @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the gauss sum @xmath75 for @xmath71 .",
    "thus , summing ( [ simpleraddtwistlfn ] ) over the residue classes modulo @xmath65 , one derives the functional equation of the standard @xmath2-function twisted by the dirichlet character @xmath76 , @xmath77    it is a pleasure to express our gratitude to james cogdell and herve jacquet . both of them helped us with detailed information about the state of the literature relevant to the appendix .",
    "we derive the voronoi summation formula not from the datum of an automorphic form , but from the essentially equivalent datum of an automorphic distribution . for the connection between the two we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "we kept the definition ( [ vld ] ) of the principal series representation with parameter @xmath39 purposely vague : when the functions @xmath8 in the definition are required to be smooth , one denotes the resulting space by @xmath78 , and when these  functions \" are only required to be distributions , one obtains @xmath79 , the larger space of distribution vectors .",
    "of course these are not the only choices of a topology for @xmath80 . in all cases the group @xmath81 acts by left translation . by definition",
    "an automorphic distribution for an arithmetic subgroup @xmath82 , with representation parameter @xmath39 , is a @xmath83-invariant vector @xmath84 in @xmath79  in other words , @xmath85 for all @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in dealing with distributions ,",
    "we adopt the same convention as in our other papers :  distributions transform like functions \"   i.e. , they are naturally dual to smooth , compactly supported measures .",
    "let @xmath88 denote the subgroup of unipotent upper triangular matrices , and @xmath89 $ ] , @xmath90 $ ] its first two derived subgroups .",
    "in the classical approach we shall work exclusively at full level ; we therefore change notation from @xmath83 to @xmath91 .",
    "analogously we let @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 denote the groups of integral points in @xmath95 and its derived subgroups .",
    "since we are working at full level , no nonzero automorphic distributions can exist unless @xmath96 .",
    "we shall also assume @xmath97 ; this can be arranged by multiplying @xmath76 by an appropriate character of the center .",
    "for emphasis ,",
    "@xmath98 the first of these assumptions is not necessary , but helps to simplify formulas and arguments .",
    "our computations involve integrating translates of @xmath76 , sometimes multiplied by smooth functions , over compact sets .",
    "this makes sense : let @xmath99 denote the left @xmath100-translate of @xmath76 , formally @xmath101 then @xmath102 is a smooth function on @xmath103 with values in the closed subspace @xmath79 of @xmath104 , from which it inherits the structure of complete , locally convex , hausdorff topological vector space .",
    "one can integrate measurable functions with values in such a topological vector space over any finite measure space .",
    "for example , since @xmath76 is @xmath91-invariant under left translation , @xmath105 induces smooth , @xmath79-valued functions on the compact spaces @xmath106 ,",
    "thus @xmath108 are well defined vectors in @xmath79 , by construction invariant under , respectively , @xmath109 and @xmath110 : @xmath111 both are also @xmath92-invariant , @xmath112 since @xmath92 leaves @xmath76 invariant , normalizes all of the four groups @xmath109 , @xmath93 , @xmath110 , @xmath94 , and preserves the measures on @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "let @xmath113 denote the subgroup of lower triangular matrices .",
    "in view of ( [ autod ] ) , every distribution in @xmath114 behaves in a @xmath115 manner under right translation by elements of @xmath116 .",
    "since @xmath117 is open in @xmath103 , we can restrict such distributions from @xmath103 to the subgroup @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "in particular this applies to @xmath118 ; we shall refer to its restriction to @xmath95 as @xmath119 .",
    "in view of ( [ tau1] 0[tau2 ] ) , and because @xmath120 is normal , @xmath121 the entries on the first superdiagonal provide coordinates @xmath122 for @xmath123 . under this identification ,",
    "the image of @xmath92 in @xmath124 corresponds to @xmath125 .",
    "thus @xmath119 , as distribution on @xmath126 ,  has the fourier expansion @xmath127 here @xmath128 as before , and @xmath129 stands for the sum @xmath130 .",
    "note that the summation does not involve terms for which at least one of the @xmath131 equals zero  this reflects the assumption of cuspidality ; cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when there are several choices of the representation parameter , as is usually the case , the coefficients @xmath132 in the expansion ( [ tauabelexp ] ) do depend on @xmath39 .",

    "in this section , we give a second , self - contained derivation of the voronoi formula using adelic automorphic distributions .",
    "since it is a second proof , we will describe only the formal aspects of the calculation ; the rigorous justification can be handled using the techniques of the previous sections .",
    "to begin , we will describe the adelization of the classical automorphic distributions from section  [ sec : background ] , considering a @xmath53-invariant automorphic distribution that comes from a cuspidal automorphic representation of @xmath1 over @xmath963 , the adele group of @xmath964 .",
    "this process is formally identical to the usual adelization of classical automorphic functions using strong approximation , though we shall present it via fourier expansions because of the key role they play later .",
    "let us first review whittaker functions for automorphic representations .",
    "we use @xmath965 to denote the standard additive character on @xmath966 , whose restriction to @xmath347 coincides with @xmath967 .",
    "it can be used to form the standard character @xmath968 of @xmath969 , by composing @xmath970 with the sum of the entries just above the diagonal .",
    "a famous formula of piatetski - shapiro and shalika shows that the smooth vectors can be represented as sums of left - translates of adelic whittaker functions @xmath971 , each of which transforms on the left under @xmath972 by the character @xmath973 . by convention , the fourier coefficient @xmath66 of such a vector is the renormalized value of the finite part of the adelic whittaker function on the matrix @xmath974 : @xmath975    we shall define adelic automorphic distributions by replacing @xmath976 with a `` boundary whittaker distribution '' @xmath977 according to the following procedure .",
    "the distribution @xmath978 , like the whittaker function @xmath979 it shall replace , will also transform on the left under @xmath95 according to this character .",
    "up to scaling , it must therefore be equal to this character on @xmath95 , and is completely described as such on the open schubert cell .",
    "we define @xmath980 to be its unique extension to an @xmath95-equivariant distribution in @xmath981 , which was proven to exist in @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this definition is as follows .",
    "consider the relation ( [ ctoa ] ) between the fourier coefficients of an automorphic form associated to @xmath76 , and the fourier coefficients of ( [ tauabelexp ] ) .",
    "the latter were just interpreted in terms of @xmath982 .",
    "the product in ( [ ctoa ] ) is the reciprocal of the _ unnormalized _ inducing character ( i.e.  without including @xmath983 ) from ( [ autod ] ) on the diagonal matrix @xmath984 ; the presence of @xmath983 accounts for the product in ( [ adelicwhitfunctionfinite ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath985 .",
    "the adelic automorphic distribution @xmath986 , in analogy to the piatetski - shapiro - shalika fourier expansion of cusp forms in terms of whittaker functions , is defined as the sum of @xmath987 , where @xmath988 runs over all cosets of @xmath989 , @xmath990 being the subgroup of unit upper triangular matrices in @xmath991 .",

    "our assumption of @xmath53 invariance forces the @xmath994-adic whittaker functions @xmath995 , for @xmath994 finite , to be right invariant under the maximal compact subgroup @xmath996 of @xmath997 . for congruence subgroups",
    ", one must alter the @xmath994-adic whittaker functions @xmath995 for @xmath994 dividing the level ( this must be done even classically , and corresponds to vector valued automorphic forms or distributions which transform under @xmath53 by a matrix action ) .",
    "we shall not pursue this here , except to note that this is a computational obstacle to deriving the voronoi formula for arbitrary congruence subgroups that in principal can be solved with enough information about ramified whittaker functions .",
    "for notational convenience , we drop the subscript @xmath963 from @xmath986 , since only this object and not @xmath76 itself will be used for the remainer of this section .",
    "our proof is based on two different formulas for the following period of the adelic automorphic distribution : @xmath998 where @xmath999 is the unipotent radical of the standard @xmath1000 parabolic of @xmath1 .",
    "one easily sees that it has the fourier expansion @xmath1001 just like automorphic forms , the automorphic distribution @xmath76 has a contragredient dual automorphic distribution @xmath1002 defined through the map ( [ rjk1.2tau ] ) and the convention that @xmath1003 this convention also serves to define dual whittaker functions and distributions @xmath1004 and @xmath1005 which transform on the left according to the complex conjugate character @xmath1006 of @xmath137 , and @xmath1002 has a similar fourier expansion in terms of @xmath1007 . since the finite whittaker functions @xmath995 are assumed to be right invariant under @xmath996 , and @xmath980 is a distribution vector for a principal series representation ( [ autod ] ) , @xmath1008 @xmath1009 denoting the standard maximal compact subgroup of @xmath1010 .",

    "for that reason we have chosen to give a proof of it in the appendix .",
    "our alternate derivation of the formula in theorem  [ mainthm ] uses the formula in proposition  [ psformulaprop ] with @xmath1016 where @xmath1017 is in the center of @xmath1018 ( which , in our full level situation , we may tacitly assume @xmath76 and @xmath1002 are invariant under ) . here",

    "note that @xmath1024 is not simply equal to the diagonal embedding of the integer @xmath889 , but is altered at its prime factors so that it is a unit at each place .",
    "both sides of the expression in the proposition are distributions in @xmath1025 . in our calculation",

    "the value of @xmath1030 on diagonal matrices factors into the contragredient fourier coefficient ( [ ctoa ] ) from section  [ sec : background ] times the value of the unnormalized inducing character .",
    "the fourier coefficient vanishes unless @xmath934 , so the above equals @xmath1031 integrating in @xmath1032 against the test function @xmath1033 gives the left hand side of the formula in theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "this is the exact same integration that was performed in the previous section to obtain the left hand side of the voronoi formula , though in adelic terminology .",
    "now we examine the right hand side of the formula in proposition  [ psformulaprop ] , with the purpose of integrating it against ( [ testfunction ] ) . unlike the calculation in the previous section",
    ", this does not directly involve the distributions @xmath334 that played a prominent role there , though the mechanics are fundamentally related .",

    "thus the integral equals @xmath1046 in effect , this last matrix step is the only tool needed to compute the value of @xmath1047 and , as we now demonstrate , also reduces the range of integration .",
    "[ lotiszero ] let @xmath1048 denote the subset of @xmath1049 with successively nondecreasing @xmath994-adic valuations at each prime , that is @xmath1050 then ( [ rhside3 ] ) is equal to @xmath1051 where @xmath1052 is the diagonal matrix @xmath1053    by ( [ nminspher ] ) , @xmath1047 is invariant under right translation by the matrix @xmath1054 for @xmath1055 , which has the effect of translating @xmath1039 to @xmath1056 .",
    "thus the integration over @xmath1057 reduces to the quotient @xmath1058 . by ignoring the set where all",
    "@xmath1059 vanish and appealing to strong approximation , we may chose coset representatives @xmath1060 such that each @xmath1061 .",
    "this condition for @xmath1062 along with the matrix identity @xmath1063 allows us to replace the last matrix in ( [ rhside3 ] ) by these last two , regarded as embedded into the upper left @xmath1064 block of @xmath1 .",
    "the first of these matrices may be passed through to the left , and causes @xmath1047 to transform by @xmath1065 .",
    "the last matrix now has the same form as the original one , but of size one dimension smaller .",
    "right translation by an integer matrix as before , along with the structure of the character , shows that this integral is unchanged if @xmath1066 , for any @xmath1067 .",
    "thus we may again assume that @xmath1068 is a @xmath994-adic unit at each place .",
    "continuing this way , we reduce the integration to the domain @xmath1069 . to summarize , we have thus factored @xmath1070 as @xmath1071 the matrix @xmath1072 lies in @xmath1073 in the region @xmath1069 , and in this situation the last matrix in ( [ rhside3 ] )",
    "can be replaced by simply @xmath1074 , for @xmath1047 is right - invariant under such a matrix @xmath1072 .",
    "therefore ( [ rhside3 ] ) can be written as @xmath1075 which equals @xmath1076 by ( [ vperiodfourexp ] ) . to obtain the expression ( [ rhside6 ] )",
    "we change the index of summation @xmath1077 to @xmath1078 , and commute the upper triangular matrix @xmath1079 across to the left so that it transforms out according the character @xmath970 of @xmath137 on the left of @xmath1080 .    the value of @xmath1081 factors into an archimedean factor ( which is the value of the inducing character on this matrix ) , times local whittaker factors .",
    "since these local whittaker functions are unramified , their value is determined by the @xmath994-adic valuations on the simple roots , and vanish unless these are all @xmath1082 : @xmath1083 let us first consider the last of these inequalities , recalling that @xmath1084 .",
    "it constrains @xmath1085 to be a @xmath994-adic unit at all places , for some divisor @xmath912 of @xmath1086 . since @xmath1087 is a bijection of such divisors , we may instead write @xmath1088 , for @xmath1089 . likewise , the constraints @xmath1090 mean that @xmath1091 .",
    "thus , @xmath1092 equals @xmath1093 for some @xmath1094 , i.e. @xmath1095 . continuing ,",
    "we see that the range of integration @xmath1096 in ( [ rhside6 ] ) can be broken up as the disjoint union over @xmath1097 of @xmath1098 the divisors in ( [ divisors ] ) are precisely the ones occurring on the right hand side of the formula in theorem  [ mainthm ] , so we are reduced to showing that ( [ rhside6 ] )  when integrated over ( [ ranges ] ) instead of @xmath1069  corresponds to the rest of the right hand side of that formula .",
    "the first constraint in ( [ simprootcondition ] ) governs the integrality of @xmath1077 , namely that on the piece ( [ ranges ] ) one has that @xmath1077 times @xmath1099 is an integer .",
    "when @xmath1077 is divided by that quantity , the sum over it in ( [ rhside6 ] ) becomes a sum over nonzero integers , corresponding to the one on the right hand side in theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "we simultaneously change variables @xmath1100 which incurs no change of measure factor because these ratios are rational numbers .",
    "this converts the domain ( [ ranges ] ) to @xmath1101 , i.e.  adeles which are @xmath994-adic units at each finite place .",
    "then the relevant contribution of ( [ rhside6 ] ) is @xmath1102 we next modify the signs of @xmath1077 and the @xmath48 so that the signs of @xmath1062 , @xmath1103 , and @xmath1104 are all flipped .",
    "thus we replace ( [ rhside7 ] ) with @xmath1105 we now observe that both @xmath970 and @xmath1080 in ( [ rhside8 ] ) split into an archimedean factor ( which is a distribution in @xmath1032 , the archimedean part of @xmath890 ) , and a nonarchimedean factor ( in which we similarly replace @xmath890 by @xmath1106 ) . in the latter ,",
    "the value of @xmath1080 is precisely equal to @xmath1107 because @xmath1024 and the @xmath1108 are all @xmath994-adic units .",
    "an arbitrary element of @xmath1109 has the form @xmath1110 , where @xmath1111 is the finite part of a rational number @xmath1039 and @xmath1112 ; the value of @xmath970 on such an adele is equal to @xmath1113 .",
    "thus if an element of @xmath1114 is added to @xmath48 , the character @xmath970 is unchanged , and the @xmath1115 part of the integral in ( [ rhside8 ] ) breaks up into a sum over cosets : it equals the hyperkloosterman sum in theorem  [ mainthm ] , divided by @xmath1116 which is the adelic measure ( i.e.  index ) of this set that it is trivial on within @xmath1117 .    at this point",
    "the calculation has shifted from adeles to reals , and essentially repeats the final steps of the calculation in the previous section .",
    "the archimedean part ( [ rhside8 ] ) , including the factor of @xmath1045 , is a distribution in @xmath1025 which is integrated against the function ( [ testfunction ] ) . in order to symmetrize the expression which follows , we now relabel @xmath1118 , the archimedean part of @xmath890 , as @xmath1119 , and the variable @xmath1120 from ( [ testfunction ] ) as @xmath1121 .",

    "each term in the exponential , aside from the first , is now a ratio of successive variables @xmath1125 .",

    "the argument of @xmath8 is divided by the product of these ratios , @xmath1131 , and so this integral is therefore by ( [ ffromf ] ) equal to the same instance of @xmath1132 occurring in theorem  [ mainthm ] , times the change of variables factor @xmath1133 to finish , we multiply the products of @xmath957 , @xmath958 , @xmath1134 , @xmath1135 , @xmath959 , @xmath960 , @xmath961 , and @xmath962 from ( [ testfunction ] ) , ( [ valueofb ] ) , ( [ archpart1 ] ) , and ( [ theendisnear ] ) , and divide by ( [ index ] ) . using ( [ sumtozero ] ) , this indeed results in @xmath1136 , verifying the right hand side of the formula in theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "in this appendix we prove proposition  [ psformulaprop ] , the main identity used in the adelic proof of our @xmath1 voronoi summation formula . we do this by establishing a more general statement , namely a crucial but unpublished ingredient in the work of jacquet , piatetski - shapiro , and",

    "recall that a fundamental domain for a discrete subgroup @xmath1052 of a topological group @xmath1168 is an open set @xmath1169 whose left @xmath1052-translates are disjoint yet dense in @xmath1168 . for any @xmath1170 , @xmath1171 is also a fundamental domain for @xmath1052 , but @xmath1172 is instead a fundamental domain for @xmath1173 .",
    "if @xmath1174 is a fundamental domain for @xmath1175 , @xmath1176 is also a fundamental domain for each @xmath1165 , because @xmath1177 normalizes @xmath1167 .",
    "it follows from this that if @xmath1178 is a fundamental domain for @xmath1179 , then @xmath1180 is a fundamental domain for @xmath1181 .",
    "more generally , if @xmath1182 is continuous , then @xmath1183 is also a fundamental domain for @xmath1184 .",
    "we now apply the above considerations to an iterated semidirect product .",
    "namely , suppose that @xmath1072 is any unipotent radical of a parabolic subgroup of @xmath1 , having dimension @xmath1185 .",
    "its adelic points @xmath1186 can be identified , setwise , with @xmath1185-tuples @xmath1187 , and its haar measure is the product of haar measures @xmath1188 from each copy .",
    "a fundamental domain for @xmath1189 is given by any product of fundamental domains for each @xmath1190 , one for each copy .",
    "we always normalize our haar measures to give volume 1 to @xmath1191 under this identification .",
    "because @xmath1072 is an iterated semidirect product of abelian groups , the remark at the end of the previous paragraph implies the following by induction :      let @xmath1192 denote the subgroup @xmath1193 , so that @xmath1194 this reduces the proposition to showing @xmath1195 for an arbitrary @xmath1196 .",
    "let @xmath1072 denote the subgroup of unit upper triangular matrices in @xmath1197 .",
    "the character @xmath1198 for @xmath1197 makes sense on @xmath1186 , and agrees with its @xmath1 variant when @xmath1072 is embedded into the lower right corner ; as no confusion will arise , we shall use the notation @xmath1198 for either sized matrix . using the notation",
    "@xmath1199 as shorthand for a fundamental domain for the quotient @xmath1200 , we define the following integrals for @xmath1201 : @xmath1202 the @xmath331 integration is clearly well defined on the quotient , justifying the use of the fundamental domain for it .",
    "we now argue that the @xmath1203 and @xmath1120 integrations are as well . to simplify notation , let us temporarily write @xmath1204\\in m_{m-1,n+1-m}$ ] and @xmath1205\\in m_{n+1-m , m-1}$ ] , so that the argument of @xmath880 is @xmath1206 .",
    "suppose first that @xmath1120 is replaced by @xmath1207 , for @xmath1208 .",
    "since @xmath880 is left invariant under @xmath1209 , the argument of @xmath880 can be replaced by @xmath1210 . since @xmath988 is unipotent upper triangular , a column of @xmath1211 is formed its counterpart in @xmath1212 by adding multiples of preceding columns to it .",
    "the reverse change of variables @xmath1213 preserves the subgroup @xmath1214 and the measure @xmath159 . likewise , the variables @xmath1203 and @xmath1215 can be changed to convert the expression back to @xmath1216 . thus the @xmath1120 integration is well defined .    to show that the @xmath1203 integration is well defined , suppose @xmath1217 has zero entries in its bottom @xmath227 rows , so that its nonzero entries correspond to positions in @xmath1203 .",
    "adding @xmath1218 to @xmath1219 likewise has the effect of replacing the matrix @xmath1220 in the argument of @xmath880 by @xmath1221 since @xmath1222 . with @xmath1223 ,",
    "one has @xmath1224 . as before , the change of variables @xmath1225 modifies rows of @xmath1219 by adding multiplies of lower rows to them .",
    "this change of variables can be undone without changing the measure , and furthermore maps any fundamental domain for @xmath1203 to another .",
    "another application of proposition  [ leftfunddomprop ] shows that the change of variables @xmath1226 also maps any fundamental domain for @xmath1227 to another as well .",
    "it also preserves the character @xmath1228 , because @xmath1229  an member of the derived subgroup @xmath1230 $ ]  lies in the kernel of @xmath1198 .",
    "thus the integrands in each @xmath1216 are well - defined on their regions of integration .",
    "the group @xmath1192 is the semidirect product of the embedding of @xmath1072 into the lower right corner of @xmath1 , and the embedding of @xmath1231 into @xmath1 given by @xmath1232 .",
    "hence the product of fundamental domains for @xmath1189 and @xmath1233 serves as a fundamental domain for @xmath1234 , and the product of their haar measures is likewise the haar measure on @xmath1192 which gives this quotient volume 1 .",
    "therefore the integral @xmath1235 reduces to the left hand side of ( [ appprop4 ] ) . when @xmath1236 , @xmath1237 let us factor the last matrix in this expression as @xmath1238 , in which @xmath1239=[\\begin{smallmatrix }   x_2 \\\\   0 \\end{smallmatrix}]$ ] .",
    "both the change of variables @xmath1240 , as well as its inverse , involve adding multiples of lower rows to higher ones , which does not alter the measure @xmath1241 . applying the same considerations about product fundamental domains and measures for @xmath1145 as observed for @xmath1192 at the beginning of this paragraph , we see that ( [ approp22 ] ) is hence equal to the right hand side of ( [ appprop4 ] ) .",
    "to complete the proof we will show that @xmath1242 , and afterwards argue the absolute convergence . starting with ( [ appprop5 ] )",
    ", we enlarge @xmath331 by adding a column to its left , denoted by @xmath1243 .",
    "let @xmath1204 $ ] be as above , but with this newly enlarged @xmath331 .",
    "let @xmath1218 now denote the @xmath1244 matrix which has all zeroes except for its @xmath1245-th row , which equals the row vector @xmath1246 .",
    "we have that @xmath1222 and @xmath1247 is strictly upper triangular , with its @xmath1248-st entry equal to @xmath1249 . using @xmath880 s left invariance under @xmath1250 , we may rewrite @xmath1216 in terms of its fourier series expansion at @xmath1251 : @xmath1252 we calculate @xmath1253 where @xmath1254 .",
    "therefore the argument of @xmath880 in ( [ approp23 ] ) is equal to @xmath1255 } & { i_{n - m+1 } } \\end{smallmatrix}{\\right ) } } { { \\left(}\\begin{smallmatrix}{i_{m-1 } } & { } \\\\ { } & { u'u } \\end{smallmatrix}{\\right ) } } g\\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] again , changing variables @xmath1226 maps any fundamental domain for @xmath1189 into another , and changes the character @xmath1228 to @xmath1256  cf .",
    "proposition  [ leftfunddomprop ] .",
    "the multiplication of the unipotent matrix @xmath1229 on @xmath1257 $ ] serves to add multiples of lower rows to a higher rows .",
    "again , since @xmath1203 and @xmath1215 are integrated over abelian groups , this can be reversed by a change of variables which does not destroy the fundamental domain for @xmath1203 or change either haar measure . after combining the sum over @xmath65 in ( [ approp23 ] ) with the integration over the bottom row of @xmath1203 , so that it becomes an integration over @xmath1258 instead of @xmath1259 , we have thus converted the expression for @xmath1216 into that for @xmath1260 .",
    "finally , we conclude by justifying the absolute convergence of all these integrals , as well as the manipulations which formally relate them . for this we shall use an argument due to jacquet - shalika ( @xcite ) in the context of exterior square @xmath2-functions .",
    "the above manipulations show that the absolute value of @xmath1216 is bounded by the analogous expression to ( [ approp23 ] ) , but with absolute values around the integrand .",
    "that expression is in turn bounded above by the expression for @xmath1260  but again with absolute values around the integrand  because it is formed by combining a union of fundamental domains together .",
    "thus each such expression is absolutely convergent and all manipulations are justified , provided the final integral @xmath1261 , or equivalently the integral in proposition  [ appprop ] , is .",
    "the absolute convergence of the @xmath1261 integral itself follows from the gauge estimates in @xcite . indeed , although the estimates there are for the analogous local integrals instead , the mechanism of bounding the unipotent integration by a rapidly decaying function of the unipotent variable applies equally to the periods @xmath1047 , because of the expression for them as a sum of whittaker functions mentioned just after the statement of this proposition ."
