    "the traditional formulation of robertson @xcite gives a lower bound on the product of the standard deviations of two observables .",
    "this state - dependent bound is proportional to the modulus of the expectation value of the commutator in the measured state .",
    "dependence on the pre - measurement state results in the fact that robertson s bound may vanish , even if the commutator itself is non - zero .",
    "for instance , a trivial bound is obtained for any eigenstate of any of the two observables @xcite .",

    "can not distinguish the uncertainty inherent in obtaining a particular combination of the outcomes .",
    "studies of the fine - grained uncertainty relations were initiated in @xcite and further developed in @xcite .",
    "majorization relations offer an alternative way to express the uncertainty principle in terms of probabilities _ per se _",
    "at the same time , majorization relations directly lead to desired inequalities in terms of the shannon entropy or other generalized entropies .",

    "@xmath63 one has a certain freedom in the operator - sum representation .",
    "suppose that the set @xmath79 is another unraveling of the quantum operation ( [ opsm ] ) .",

    ", we assume that the sets @xmath82 and @xmath83 have the same cardinality by adding zero operators , if needed .",

    "if required , one can rescale the above formulas in order to change the base of the logarithm . in the following",
    ", we will use the fact that entropies ( [ renent ] ) and ( [ tsaent ] ) are both schur concave .",
    "many properties of entropies ( [ renent ] ) and ( [ tsaent ] ) and their applications are discussed in the book @xcite .",
    "we now recall some details of the majorization approach in finite dimensions .",
    "applications of this approach to the case of position and momentum are discussed in @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath95 and @xmath96 denote two probability vectors generated by two quantum measurements performed on two copies of the same quantum state .",
    "the key idea of this approach is to majorize some binary combination of @xmath95 and @xmath96 by a third vector with bounding elements .",
    "majorization relations of the tensor - product type , first considered in @xcite , are obtained by finding a probability vector @xmath104 such that the following majorization relation holds , @xmath105 in the present paper , we also deal with majorization relations of the direct - sum type originally introduced in @xcite .",
