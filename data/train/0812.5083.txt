    "we are aware of the likely extension of the survey area .",

    "( 2006 ) show that tomographic analyses with multi - bins of source galaxies ( denoted as @xmath55 ) can improve the statistical errors on cosmological parameter constraints considerably in comparison with those of 2-d analyses .",
    "the improvement increases with the increase of @xmath55 . on the other hand",

    "therefore the accuracy of photometric redshifts is sensitive to the wavelength coverage of observations .",

    ". then a series of simulations are carried out .",
    "the details of the simulations will be presented in jouvel et al .",
    "( 2009 in prep . ) . here",
    "we give a brief description .",
    "the simulations are performed with the le phare software .",

    "( 2005 ) , each with an assigned spectrum based on the coleman extended templates ( coleman et al . 1980 ) .",
    "this set of templates contains @xmath63 spectra obtained by interpolating between @xmath57 standard spectra : elliptical , sbc , scd , irregular and star forming galaxies .",
    "we then apply the filtering process to the simulated spectra with the 9-filter set .",
    "we thus obtain the sed for each simulated galaxy .",
    "the magnitudes of galaxies are randomly assigned in accordance with the properties of our fiducial survey .",
    "the photometric redshift for each galaxy is then computed using the lephare photometric redshift code .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : snap ] .",
    "it is seen that scatters and biases around @xmath21 exist for @xmath20 .",
    "besides , there are notable islands in the @xmath64-@xmath20 plot .",
    "the dominant one is located at @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which accounts for more than @xmath67 of the galaxies with @xmath68 .",
    "this island obviously comes from the confusion of the @xmath60 break with the lyman break in galaxy seds due to the limited wavelength coverage .",
    "it is found that the fraction of galaxies with such large catastrophic errors is about @xmath69 of the total number of galaxies . in our study",
    ", we particularly analyze the effect of this island on the constraints of dark energy parameters .",
    "to characterize the true distribution of galaxies whose photometric redshifts suffer from catastrophic failures , we use the following gaussian distribution with the form @xmath70 , \\label{eq : cata}\\ ] ] where the true mean redshift of the island @xmath71 and the standard deviation @xmath72 are obtained from fitting to the spectral(true)-z distribution histogram of the island .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 is determined by normalizing the gaussian distribution to the overall fraction of catastrophic failures @xmath74 .",
    "then in a tomographic division according to galaxies photometric redshifts , this part will be mistakenly shifted from low - z bin to another high - z bin .",
    "specifically , for the @xmath75 tomography we consider , the @xmath69 galaxies with their true - z falling in the first bin are assigned to the last ( 5th ) bin whose redshift range is @xmath76 .",
    "once the distribution of catastrophic failure fraction is known , we can evaluate the biases it induces on dark energy parameter estimates .    as mentioned in the previous subsection",
    ", we need to be aware of the fact that observationally , source galaxies are assigned to different redshift bins in terms of their observed photometric redshifts rather than their true redshifts .",
    "hence , a fraction of low redshift galaxies can be mistakenly distributed to high - redshift bins due to the catastrophic errors . as a consequence ,",
    "weak lensing signals from those relevant tomographic bins are perturbed and biases on cosmological parameter estimates may arise , if models used to fit the data were not modified correspondingly .    concerning the fiducial survey in this study , we know from simulations that there will be @xmath74 galaxies being misplaced into the 5th bin ( denoted as bin-5 ) , whilst their true redshifts are within the range of the first bin ( denoted as bin-1 ) .",
    "the true distribution of this catastrophic failure part can be described with eq .",
    "( [ eq : cata ] ) and will be labeled as bin - cata for convenience in the following discussion .",
    "note that the true z - range of bin - cata is within the z - range of bin-1 .    for bin-1 ,",
    "when bin - cata galaxies within it are misplaced in bin-5 due to catastrophic redshift errors , the number of galaxies contained in bin-1 is reduced .",
    "the redshift distribution of the galaxies left in it also changes somewhat in comparison with the true distribution without the catastrophic errors .",
    "the number change in bin-1 does not affect the lensing signal because the galaxy distribution within the bin is always normalized to unity .",
    "the shape change of the redshift distribution in the bin may have some effects . on the other hand , however , this change may already be included in the modeled overall redshift distribution of galaxies derived from photometric redshifts .",
    "thus in our consideration , we assume that the misplacement of bin - cata does not affect the lensing signal from bin-1 .    for bins in between bin-1 and bin-5 ,",
    "obviously the lensing signals should be kept unperturbed . combining the previous analysis for bin-1 , we thus get @xmath77 , where @xmath78 .    to the contrary , the lensing signals from bin-5 get perturbed .",
    "as shown in the bottom - left panel of figure [ fig : model ] , it in fact consists of two parts of galaxies , one with their true redshifts falling in bin-5 and the other being a contamination from bin - cata .",
    "correspondingly , besides the auto spectra of bin-5 , those cross spectra with one of the bins being bin-5 will also be affected . in this case , those convergence power spectra can be expressed as @xmath79 with @xmath80 where we omit the antecedent terms identical to those in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : weights ] ) .",
    "the true ( spectral ) galaxy distribution of bin-5 can be written as @xmath81\\nonumber \\\\ & = & { 1 \\over f_5+f_{\\rm cata}}\\ , \\ { n_5(z)+a_{\\rm cata}\\exp\\bigg [ -{(z - z_m)^2\\over 2\\sigma^2}\\bigg ] \\ } \\label{eqn : n5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is to normalize @xmath83 to be unity , with @xmath84 being the overall fraction of galaxies with their true redshifts falling in bin-5 .",
    "here the right side terms @xmath85 and @xmath86 are normalized to their overall fraction @xmath84 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "@xmath73 is thus determined by @xmath87 , as mentioned in the paragraph following eq .",

    "( [ eq : c_obs ] ) , finally we get the observed total spectra @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "in practical analysis , when calculating the ` theoretically expected ' lensing signals for bin-5 , we have no knowledge , in the case without spectroscopic calibration , of the fraction of low redshift galaxies and regard all the galaxies being at high redshifts ; or in the case with inadequate spectroscopic calibration , we have inaccurate knowledge therefore can make unprecise estimation of the fraction and distribution of low - z galaxies ( see figure [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "the former can be denoted as @xmath92 , with c being an arbitrary constant .",
    "the latter case gives @xmath93 , where the estimations @xmath94 and @xmath95 can deviate from their true values depending on the calibration size .",
    "consequently systematic biases may arise when the theoretically expected signals @xmath96 are compared with the observed ones @xmath97 to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "as an approximation , a simple extension of the fisher matrix formalism can be used to compute the bias in cosmological parameters with ( see huterer et al .",

    "the comparison of their results permits us to quantify the extent to which the linear approximation is valid .",

    "all the weak lensing related calculations are done with the icosmo package ( refregier , version 2005 ) , with modifications from 2d weak lensing to tomographic form for our specific study .",

    "to demonstrate clearly their significance , in this section , we present the results of bias on dark energy parameters due to catastrophic failures if there is no spectroscopic calibration for the problematic bin-5 .",
    "we apply both methods by @xmath3 fitting and by computation with the extension of fisher matrix formalism . in the next section",
    ", we will focus on the requirements for the spectroscopic calibrations .",
    "first , we employ the @xmath109 fitting method .",
    "as described in the previous section , for bin-5 , the observed signal is a combination of the two parts illustrated in the bottom - left panel of figure [ fig : model ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the model calculation is done with the galaxy distribution illustrated in the top panel of figure [ fig : model ] .",
    "the @xmath109 fitting is then applied to find the ` best - fit ' values of the cosmological parameters by comparing the model - predicted lensing signals with the ` observational data ' . in this fitting process",
    ", the ` measurement errors ' for each ` data point ' are theoretically calculated using a binned form of eq .",

    "we discard weak lensing information from all those scales beyond @xmath111 to avoid complications from various small - scale effects , such as baryonic cooling ( white 2004 , zhan & knox 2005 , jing et al . 2006 ) and non - gaussianity ( white & hu 2000 , cooray & hu 2001 ) .",
    "we apply binning procedures to @xmath43 . according to hu & white 2001",
    ", the bin width should be at least twice as big as @xmath112 , in order to reduce the covariance between the bins arising from the survey geometry .",
    "we then take @xmath113 bins , uniform in logarithmic scale over the range @xmath114 $ ] .    in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : bias ] , we show the resulting bias on the equation of state of dark energy obtained from @xmath3 fitting .",
    "gaussian priors @xmath115 for @xmath116 and @xmath117 for others are applied upon the hidden parameters in our 7-parameter fiducial model .",
    "these priors are consistent with the current constraints .",
    "it is found that the @xmath0 catastrophic failure fraction can bring large biases on @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the tomographic 5 z - bins case , highly significant compared to their statistical errors .",
    "the ` best fit ' values are @xmath118 and @xmath119 in comparison with the fiducial ones @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the results from the extended fisher matrix formalism are shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : bias ] . the same @xmath43-binning process and gaussian priors are applied .",
    "the ` best fit ' values are found to be @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "thus the linear approximation results in a notably larger bias than those of the @xmath3 fitting .",
    "this significant discrepancy reveals clearly the necessity to go beyond the linear approximation from the fisher matrix formalism .    in summary ,",
    "our analyses show that for our fiducial survey with a 9-filter set , the catastrophic photo - z errors with @xmath124 can bias the dark energy parameters at a level far exceeding the statistical errors if no further spectroscopic calibration is conducted .",
    "our calculations are done for a survey area @xmath125 , corresponding to a sky coverage @xmath49 .",
    "increasing the survey area reduces the statistical errors with @xmath126 . on the other hand ,",
    "the absolute biases on cosmological parameters should not change much .",
    "this can be seen clearly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bias ] ) in which @xmath127 enters through @xmath102 and @xmath128 . since both are proportional to @xmath129 , their dependencies on @xmath127 cancel out .",
    "thus with a larger sky coverage , the effect of the bias relative to the statistical errors would be even larger if the catastrophic fraction @xmath87 remains @xmath130 .",
    "the large bias seen in figure [ fig : bias ] clearly reveals the necessity to take extra measures to reduce the effects of the catastrophic redshift errors . among others",
    ", the spectroscopic calibration can play an crucial role in this regard .",
    "it is known that the spectroscopic calibration can be done either by taking spectra of a sub - sample of source galaxies after photo - z measurements or by employing a sophisticated technique where the spectral information is included in the determination of photometric redshifts .",
    "we consider the former case in our analyses , and explore the requirements of the spectroscopic calibration . specifically , we study the needed number of galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts in order to retrieve the unbiased parameter estimates .    since we particularly analyze the ` island ' catastrophic failures around @xmath131 seen in figure [ fig : snap ] , we consider the calibration for galaxies with their photo - z in the range @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that our simulation results shown in figure [ fig : snap ] reflect the real relation between photo - z and the true redshifts for observed galaxies .",
    "in other words , we take the simulation results as the fiducial distribution with an overall @xmath9",

    "first when the bias is large and the fitted values are outside the @xmath142 contour , the results from the linear approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bias ] ) start to deviate from the @xmath3 fitting results , as seen most evidently in the upper right panel .",
    "this shows the limitation of the linear approximation .",
    "if in some cases , very large biases are expected , it is necessary to perform a full @xmath3 fitting to evaluate quantitatively the biases .",
    "otherwise , an over - estimate of the bias on @xmath4 and @xmath5 would be obtained from the linear analysis .",
    "this is in good accordance with the results shown in figure [ fig : bias ] . on the other hand , when the biases are within the @xmath142 statistical contour , the two sets of results are in excellent agreement .",
    "thus in this regime , the linear approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bias ] ) provides us an accurate and convenient way to estimate the bias effects .",
    "we further find that the triangles from the linear calculations are almost perfectly on a straight line with little scatters .",
    "the results from the full @xmath3 calculations follow the same line when the biases are relatively small , and are bent downward when the biases are large . noting that the biases depend on three quantities ( @xmath134 , @xmath137 , @xmath95 ) ,",
    "the lining up of the results indicate that there is a dominant factor among the three .",
    "our detailed analyses , presented later in figure 6 , show that the biases are mainly determined by @xmath143 , and the shape of the redshift distribution in bin - cata ( described by the parameters @xmath137 , @xmath95 ) has insignificant effects .",
    "the straight line behavior presents us a quantitative way to describe the joint bias of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we define the joint bias of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for a realization , denoted by @xmath144 , as the distance in the ( @xmath145 ) plane , between the fiducial point and the best - fit point of this realization , with a sign equal to @xmath146 @xmath147 @xmath148 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , to quantify the relative bias with respect to the statistical errors , we define the corresponding joint statistical error @xmath149 as the distance in the ( @xmath145 ) plane between the fiducial point and the intersection point of the straight line with a given statistical error contour . this definition accounts correctly for the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    to see the dependence of the bias on calibrations , in figure [ fig : real ] , we show the correlation of the joint bias @xmath150 defined above and the residual @xmath87 ( corresponding to @xmath151 ) from each individual realization for @xmath141 .",
    "it clearly demonstrates that the bias scales approximately linearly with the fraction of catastrophic failures .",
    "the small dispersions of @xmath144 at a fixed residual @xmath87 correspond to results with different calibrated @xmath137 and @xmath95 for bin - cata .",
    "this reveals quantitatively that the effect of the specific distribution within bin - cata is sub - dominant , compared to the impact of the overall fraction of bin - cata , namely @xmath152 .",
    "this fact actually allows us to obtain an approximate scaling relation for the dependence of the bias on the survey area @xmath127 and on the catastrophic fraction @xmath87 , which will be discussed shortly .    with the biases obtained from individual realizations",
    ", we can statistically quantify the typical level of bias for a given @xmath133 . from figure",
    "[ fig : compare ] and [ fig : real ] , we see that the average bias from all the realizations of a given @xmath133 is expected to be close to zero .",
    "hence we use the root - mean - square bias calculated from the bias distribution to characterize the bias level for that particular @xmath133 . to illustrate it more clearly , in figure [ fig : rms ] , we show the distribution of @xmath144 from @xmath153 realizations for @xmath141 .",
    "the bias for each individual realization is calculated by employing the fisher matrix formalism eq .",
    "( [ eq : bias ] ) since it can give good approximation when the residual @xmath87 is reasonably small .",
    "it can be seen that the distribution is very close to a zero - mean gaussian distribution .",
    "the rms bias is calculated to be @xmath154\\approx 0.61 $ ] for @xmath141 .",
    "we perform such a calculation on @xmath154 $ ] for each considered @xmath133 , and the results are shown in figure [ fig : scaling ] .",
    "we can see that @xmath154\\propto 1/\\sqrt{n_{\\rm spec}}$ ] to a very good approximation , and can be written as @xmath154=0.61/\\sqrt{n_{\\rm spec}/500}$ ] . for @xmath49 and @xmath74 ,",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath13 @xmath4 and @xmath5 joint statistical errors defined above are @xmath155 and @xmath156 , respectively .",
    "then the needed @xmath157 and @xmath158 so that the rms bias @xmath154 $ ] can be smaller than the @xmath14 and @xmath13 statistical errors , respectively .",
    "the specific results on the required @xmath133 shown above are calculated with @xmath49 and @xmath9 .",
    "however , based on our analyses , we can derive a scaling relation which permits us to estimate the needed @xmath133 for different @xmath127 and @xmath87 . as illustrated in figure [ fig : real ] , the bias is linearly proportional to @xmath159 .",
    "thus the rms bias @xmath154 $ ] should be approximately proportional to the rms of @xmath159 , namely @xmath160 . furthermore , for a set of realizations , the number of calibrating galaxies that are identified to be in bin - cata follows the binomial distribution with a mean value of @xmath161 and the variance of @xmath162 , where @xmath163 , with @xmath164 and @xmath165 representing the total number of galaxies and the number of galaxies with @xmath132 , respectively . in our consideration",
    ", we have @xmath166 , and the distribution is close to the poisson distribution",
    ". then @xmath167 .",
    "on the other hand , as we discussed in  3 , the absolute bias should not depend on the survey area .",
    "the statistical error @xmath149 scales as @xmath168 .",
    "therefore the relative bias with respect to the statistical error scales as @xmath169 .",
    "this in turn gives rise to the scaling relation for the needed @xmath170 .",
    "we then have @xmath171 for keeping the bias smaller than the @xmath14 statistical error .",
    "thus for @xmath9 and @xmath172 ( @xmath173 ) , we would need @xmath174 .",
    "we emphasize that the number @xmath175 in the scaling relation above , depends on the specific detail of the considered catastrophic errors and the overall galaxy redshift distribution @xmath176 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : bias ] ) ] .",
    "our analyses are particularly for the island located at @xmath177 , which is the dominant catastrophic error occurrence seen from our photo - z simulations .",
    "it is known that the pattern of catastrophic errors depends on specific photo - z measurements , notably on the wavelength coverage and the filter set used .",
    "thus different sets of filters would result in different catastrophic errors , and consequently different calibration requirements .",
    "it is noted that the above linear scaling relation for @xmath87 is an approximate one as the normalization ( @xmath175 here ) has a mild dependence on the fiducial value of @xmath87 .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the calibration requirement we present does not contain the part needed internally for the photo - z measurements , which we assume have been done with considerable accuracy , prior to yielding the @xmath9 catastrophic outliers .",
    "in this paper , we concentrate on the island part of the galaxies in the @xmath178 plot where @xmath179 is completely mis - estimated .",
    "this type of large catastrophic failures in the photometric redshift measurements arise from the confusion of different characteristics of galaxies sed due to the limited wavelength coverage .",
    "the most notable features used in the photo - z measurement of galaxies are the lyman and @xmath60 breaks .",
    "the mis - identification of the two results in the islands at @xmath23 and @xmath180 seen in figure 1 .",
    "we particularly analyze the systematic bias induced by such islands on cosmological parameter estimations .",
    "we find that a fraction of @xmath181 catastrophic failures due to galaxies at @xmath182 being misidentified to be at @xmath183 , which is the dominant case of catastrophic failure occurrence in our photo - z simulations , can bring systematic biases on @xmath4 and @xmath5 at a level far exceeding the statistical errors in @xmath57-tomographic - bin analysis .",
    "it has been realized that spectroscopic redshift calibration may be necessary for future weak lensing surveys in order to reduce the uncertainty of photometric redshift errors .",
    "the large bias shown in our analyses reinforces such an argument .",
    "we investigate the requirements of the spectroscopic calibration to retrieve the unbiased parameter estimates .",
    "we find that for @xmath9 , and @xmath49 , about 400 - 1000 spectral redshift measurements for galaxies with @xmath184 $ ] are needed .",
    "we further present a scaling relation of @xmath185 .",
    "thus for a future survey with a survey area of @xmath186 , the size of the calibration sample in the redshift range @xmath184 $ ] should be on the order of @xmath187 if @xmath87 remains to be @xmath130 . in analyzing the error degradation from general photometric errors",
    ", people have argued that the inaccuracy of the high redshift photometric measurements can be compensated by increasing the measurement accuracy for galaxies at relatively low redshifts .",
    "therefore much less spectroscopic calibration samples at high redshifts are needed ( e.g. , ma et al .",
    "concerning the catastrophic - error - induced bias discussed in this paper , however , there is no such a compensation .",
    "thus the required @xmath188 spectral calibrations in @xmath184 $ ] may be regarded as challenging tasks .",
    "it is also argued that the inclusion of both u and near - ir filters is essential for the accuracy of photo - z and the minimization of the catastrophic outliers ( e.g. , dahlen et al .",
    "2008 , abdalla et al . 2008 ) , as the lyman and @xmath60 breaks can be effectively distinguished .",
    "given that our simulations with @xmath189-filter set already include the near - ir bands , we consider the improvements from u band coverage . extending the wavelength coverage to @xmath190 , our simulations show that the catastrophic failure fraction decreases dramatically to the level around @xmath191 ( jouvel et al .",
    "2009 , in prep . )",
    ". in this case , the bias should no longer be significant compared to the statistical errors .",
    "it is thus important to investigate the possibility to include @xmath192 sensitivity for the next generation space dark energy mission .",
    "it has also been proposed to filter out those problematic galaxies , such as late type galaxies , low signal - to - noise galaxies , or very low / high redshift ( e.g. , @xmath193/@xmath194 ) galaxies whose photo - zs are most suspicious , in the shear analysis to reduce the impact of catastrophic failures ( abdalla et al .",
    "2008 ; margoniner & wittman 2008 ; heavens , kitching & taylor 2006 ) .",
    "in such cases , the statistical power of a survey is inevitably lowered to certain extents depending on the fraction of galaxies discarded . in figure [ fig : cut ] , we show the degradation of the constraints if those galaxies at @xmath193 and @xmath194 ( thus 3 bins left ) are excluded in the analyses , compared to the case with calibrated ( known ) @xmath195 .",
    "we see that the figure of merit ( denoted as f.o.m ) , where f is the reduced fisher matrix for @xmath4 and @xmath5 after marginalization over other parameters .",
    "] decreases from 41 to 24 , i.e. , almost a factor of two degradation .",
    "if we re - divide the galaxies with @xmath196 into @xmath57 finer bins ( right panel of figure [ fig : cut ] ) , the f.o.m = 29 , or a degradation factor @xmath197 ( see also table 1 for a summary . ) .",
    "all these calculations are done with our fiducial survey conditions and gaussian priors @xmath115 for @xmath116 and @xmath117 are applied upon all other parameters .    in our current analyses ,",
    "we isolate the island galaxies appearing around @xmath198,@xmath199 to see clearly their effects on cosmic shear analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "the scatters and small bias of @xmath20 around @xmath21 have been modeled and studied in , for example , ma et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . with @xmath200 and @xmath201 as well as",
    "their uncertainties @xmath202 and @xmath203 taken into account , the statistical errors of the constrained cosmological parameters will be degraded depending on the values of ( @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 ) . for instance , considering ( @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath204 ) @xmath205 , the degradation factor for @xmath4 and @xmath5 is about @xmath206 ( ma et al .",
    "2006 ) . then a crude estimate based on our analyses gives the needed @xmath133 at @xmath207 $ ] to be about @xmath208 to control the bias down to @xmath14 level for @xmath9 and @xmath209 .",
    "more complete analyses should be done for both the degradation and the bias simultaneously taking into account both the small and the large photo - z errors .",
