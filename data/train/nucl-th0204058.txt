    "recently there has been much interest in studying nuclear physics problems , particularly the two - nucleon problem , using effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the eft approach is to shrink the full - space theory to a small - space one which contains only the low - momentum modes .",
    "this is accomplished by integrating out the high momentum modes , thus generating effective couplings which implicitly contain the effects of the high - momentum modes . in this way",
    ", one can derive a low - momentum nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potential , which is specifically designed for low - energy nuclear physics .",
    "the low - momentum nn potentials so constructed have indeed been quite successful in describing the two - nucleon system at low energy .",
    "@xcite    in the present work , we would like to derive also a low - momentum nn potential , although along a different direction .",
    "there are a number of realistic nucleon - nucleon potentials @xmath0 , such as the bonn @xcite and paris @xcite potentials , which all describe the observed deuteron and nn scattering data very well .",
    "they have both low- and high - momentum components .",
    "in fact because of the strong short range repulsion contained in them , their momentum space matrix elements @xmath5 are still significant at large momentum .",
    "we would like to reduce such realistic potentials , in a physically equivalent way , to certain effective low - momentum nn potentials , @xmath1 , which have only slow momentum components , below a chosen cut - off momentum @xmath3 .",
    "the schroedinger equation for the full - space two - nucleon problem is written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the kinetic - energy operator for the two - nucleon system .",
    "a model space p is defined as a momentum subspace with @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the two - nucleon relative momentum .",
    "we want to transform the above equation to a model - space one @xmath10 where the low - momentum effective interaction is denoted as @xmath1 .",
    "as far as the low - energy physics is concerned , we would like to have @xmath11 to be physically equivalent to @xmath12 .",
    "specifically , this means the requirement that the deuteron binding energy , low - energy nn phase shifts and the low - momentum half - on - shell t - matrix of h are all reproduced by @xmath11 .",
    "the full - space half - on - shell t - matrix for @xmath0 is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the unperturbed energy for state @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding model - space t - matrix given by @xmath16 is @xmath17 note for @xmath18 the intermediate states are integrated up to @xmath3 .",
    "the boundary conditions associated with the free green s function are not written out , for simplicity . for p and p both belonging to p ( i.e. both @xmath19 )",
    ", we require @xmath20    base on the kuo - lee - ratcliff ( klr ) folded - diagram method @xcite , bogner , kuo and coraggio @xcite have recently shown that the above requirements can be satisfied when the low - momentum effective interaction is given by the folded - diagram series @xmath21 where @xmath22 , often referred to as the @xmath23-box , is an irreducible vertex function in the sense that its intermediate states must be outside the model space p. the integral sign appearing above represents a generalized folding operation @xcite .",
    "@xmath24 is obtained from @xmath22 by removing terms of first order in the interaction @xmath0 .",
    "let us outline their proof .",
    "a general term of the above t - matrix can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "note that the intermediate states cover the entire space ( 1=p+q where p denotes the model space and q its complement ) .",
    "writing it out in terms of p and q , a typical term of t is @xmath27 .",
    "note it has three segments partitioned by two @xmath28 propagators .",
    "let us define a @xmath23-box as @xmath29 , where all intermediate states belong to q. one readily sees that the previous term is just a part of the three-@xmath23-box term , and in general we have @xmath30 . by performing a folded - diagram factorization of each term with more than one @xmath23-box , one can rewrite the t - matrix as @xmath31 .",
    "the above result then follows .",
    "the above @xmath1 may be calulated using iteration methods .",
    "we have done so using both the andreozzi - lee - suzuki ( als ) and andreozzi - krenciglowa - kuo ( akk ) iteration methods@xcite , for both the bonn - a and paris potentials .",
    "we note that @xmath1 is energy independent , and it contains less information than the full - space @xmath0 .",
    "the als method converges to the lowest ( in energy ) d states of h , d being the dimension of the model space .",
    "( here we have discretized the momentum space , writing h as a finite matrix . )",
    "in contrast , the akk method converges to the d states of h with maximum p - space overlaps .",
    "we have found that the @xmath1 given by both methods are very close to each other , an indication that the intruder - state problem @xcite does not seem to be present in our present calculation . the deuteron binding energy given by @xmath0 is very accurately reproduced by @xmath1 , for a wide range of @xmath3 . in fig.1 , we compare the phase shifts given by @xmath0 and those by @xmath1 .",
    "they agree quite well .",
    "empirical phase shifts are determined up to @xmath32mev , and they are given by the fully - on - shell t - matrix . hence we need to use @xmath33 , if we want @xmath1 to reproduce the phase shifts up to this energy . in fig .",
    "2 , we compare the half - on - shell t - matrices ( calculated with the principal - value boundary condition ) given by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , they also agree quite well .",
    "note that plotted are the ( k,k ) matrix elements with @xmath34 , m being the nucleon mass .",
    "there are a number of similarities between the model - space reduction method used here and the renormaliztion group method employed in effective field theory , and it would be useful to elucidate the connection between them . since our method exactly preserves the half - on - shell t - matrix , it may provide a convenient way to study the flow equation which describes the change of the low - momentum effective interaction with respect to the momentum cutoff .    to summarize ,",
    "we have reduced realistic nn potentials @xmath35 ( bonn - a and paris ) to corresponding effective low - momentum potentials @xmath1 for a model space of @xmath36 .",
    "the deuteron binding energy , low - energy phase shifts and the low - momentum half - on - shell t - matrix given by @xmath0 are all reproduced by @xmath1 . because of the strong short - range repulsion contained in @xmath0 ,",
    "it is well known that we can not use it directly in shell - model calulations of nuclei and/or in hartree - fock calculations of nuclear matter ; we need first to convert @xmath0 into a g - matrix , to take care of the short - range correlations .",
    "the g - matrix so obtained is energy dependent .",
    "we have found that our @xmath1 is a generally smooth potential ( without strong short range repulsion ) , and it is energy independent .",
    "it may be suitable to use @xmath1 directly in the above calculations , without the need of first calculating the usual brueckner g - matrix .",
    "this would be of interest and desirable .",
    "we have done some shell model calculations @xcite in this direction , and obtained rather encouraging results .",
    "nuclear matter calculations using @xmath1 are in progress .",
    "we thank prof .",
    "brown for many stimulating discussions .",

    "doe grant no .",
