    "in this technique , a rotating polarizer is used to modulate the polarization state of the terahertz light . in a manner to be described below",
    ", it allows for direct detection of the vertical ( @xmath18 ) and horizontal ( @xmath19 ) components of the electric field after passing through a sample using the in - phase and out - of - phase channels of a lock - in amplifier , respectively .",
    "the advantage of this technique is three - fold .",
    "first , measurement time is reduced as a single measurement determines both electric field polarization states , compared to the two measurements required with static polarizers .",
    "second , because the two polarization channels are measured simultaneously , time dependent common mode noise may be ratioed out , improving the signal of measurements such as kerr and faraday spectroscopies . third , as the experiment is only sensitive to the modulation of the polarization state , many detrimental effects due to the finite extinction ratio of the analyzing polarizers cancel out , improving the accuracy of the measurement .",
    "we first describe the mathematical analysis in detail . as usual ,",
    "a time - domain pulse @xmath20 can be written as a superposition of fourier components    @xmath21    here , @xmath20 is the purely real electric field propagating through the system , and @xmath22 describes the amplitude of the complex fourier components that comprise @xmath20.the mathematical description of the pulse as it propagate through the system is easiest to perform in terms of these fourier components .",
    "the propagation of the fourier components as they travel through the system can be described with the jones matrix formalism . in this formalism a matrix with ( in general ) complex elements acts on the fourier component with electric field amplitude @xmath23 to produce a final polarization state @xmath24 :    @xmath25    the advantage of this formalism is that a complicated series of optical elements can be represented as a simple set of matrix multiplications @xmath26 on the original electric field fourier component .",
    "the jones matrix for a polarizer with its transmission axis oriented at an angle @xmath27 with respect to the @xmath18 axis is given by :    @xmath28    here , a polarizer with @xmath29 polarizes light in the @xmath18 direction and is denoted @xmath30 , and a polarizer with @xmath31 is called @xmath32 . for a rotating polarizer with angular velocity @xmath33 , the angle @xmath27 is simply replaced by the factor @xmath34 to obtain the polarizer matrix as a function of time .    in general ,",
    "the goal of ellipsometry is to determine the values of the complex elements of the jones transfer matrix for a sample .",
    "the changes in amplitude and phase these elements produce in the electric field can then be correlated with physical properties of the sample , such as the conductivity .",
    "the complex transfer matrix @xmath35 for a sample is represented as :    @xmath36    in the setup described here , a rotating polarizer is used to modulate the polarization of a terahertz waveform after it has passed through the sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_diagram ] ) .",
    "analysis of the time dependence of the waveform can be used to extract the frequency dependent components of the @xmath35 matrix .    using the jones matrices to describe the frequency domain fourier components of the waveform as they travel through the sample and rotator ,",

    "the analysis can be greatly simplified by adding vertical polarizers before and after the rotator and sample , respectively , ( fig .",

    "first , there is the time associated with the position of the delay stage ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_diagram ] ) , determining the small time window of the terahertz pulse that is being measured .",
    "we denote this time as @xmath44 .",

    "( [ sx_meas ] ) and ( [ sy_meas ] ) with the fields found in eq .",
    "( [ static_meas ] ) , it is apparent that the rotator measurement is equivalent to direct measurement of the x and y components of the electric field after the sample simultaneously in the two lock - in channels . eqs .",
    "( [ sx_meas ] ) and ( [ sy_meas ] ) represent the principle result of this analysis : that a single measurement with the rotator technique is exactly equivalent to two measurements with a standard static polarizer setup .    in a real system",
    ", the non - ideality of the components must be taken into account .",
    "for example , perfectly aligned off - axis parabolic mirrors produce no rotation of the polarization state , but in a real system perfect alignment is impossible to achieve . in this regard placement of optical elements in the setup is crucial . in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_diagram ] off - axis parabolic mirrors ( oaps ) 1 and 2 can introduce a rotation @xmath59 of the initial polarization state of the electric field from the emitter . to eliminate measurement errors introduced by this rotation , it is critical to place the first static polarizer _",
    "after _ oaps 1 and 2 , which essentially redefines the initial vertical electric field for the measurement at this point .    for oaps 3 and 4 the same problem exists .",
    "consider the situation explicitly if polarizer p2 is placed not immediately before oap 3 , but instead after oap 4 .",
    "the total rotation @xmath60 produced from small misalignments in oaps 3 and 4 can be represented by the rotation matrix :    @xmath61    the @xmath18 polarized light detected in the two channels of the lock - in becomes a mixture of the components of the @xmath35 matrix :    @xmath62    as before , placing a polarizer between the rotator and oap 3 simplifies the result :    @xmath63    now each channel acquires the same rotation factor of @xmath64 , which merely acts to scale the overall magnitude of the electric field .",
    "there is no mixing of the polarization states in the lock - in channels .",
    "the finite extinction ratio of the polarizers in the system is also a factor in the overall system performance .",
    "the jones matrix for an imperfect polarizer is @xcite :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the extinction ratio of the polarizer , defined as the ratio of the transmitted electric field when the polarizer transmission axis is perpendicular and parallel to the electric field direction , @xmath67 . accounting for the finite extinction ratio ( @xmath68 ) of the rotating polarizer in the jones matrix analysis , the measured signals become :    @xmath69    the finite extinction ratio of the rotating polarizer acts only as a simple scaling of the amplitude of the measured electric field .",
    "this highlights a distinct advantage of the modulation technique over the standard static polarizer measurements : only modulated signals are measured by the lock - in , and non - ideality of the rotating polarizer only produces a small effect on the amplitude of the measured electric fields .",
    "commercially available polarizers in this frequency range typically have extinction ratios of @xmath70 , resulting in only @xmath71 difference between the ideal and real signals .",
    "the best figure of merit for the rotating polarizer becomes its stability under rotation and its robustness to high rotation rates to reduce @xmath72 noise , not the extinction ratio .",
    "finally , the effects of the finite extinction ratios of the static polarizers must be considered .",
    "this changes the form of the vertical polarization matrix , @xmath30 , to    @xmath73    finite extinction ratios of the static polarizers mix different @xmath35 matrix components in the measured signals .",
    "since the rotator projects the electric field onto the second polarizer at large angles , a non - trivial electric field leakage results and the elements of the @xmath35 matrix are mixed in the two detection channels .",
    "the obvious solution is to increase the quality of polarizer , but while polarizers with significantly higher extinction ratios in the terahertz range have been demonstrated , they are still not at the stage of commercial production @xcite .",
    "as shown below the solution to this problem relies on the final analysis performed on the collected time domain waveforms .    as described above , in order to obtain the electric field components as a function of frequency , the measured time domain waveform is fourier transformed to obtain the frequency response . for many measurements performed in this system , the quantity of interest is the rotation angle introduced by the sample , which can be found by simply taking the ratio of the fourier transforms of @xmath74 and @xmath75 . for the case of vertical p1 and p2 polarizers ( eq .",
    "( [ sx_meas ] ) ) :    @xmath76    if the polarizers are assumed to be ideal , simple cases such as rotation can be explicitly solved .",

    "the situation is particularly complicated for the case where small misalignments in off - axis parabolic mirrors given finite angles @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "however , we can perform a taylor expansion in @xmath66 up to second order for a simple rotation , giving    @xmath80    this expansion shows that a single measurement is in general not sufficient to determine the rotation angle . even with the setup optimized by proper polarizer placement to eliminate first order rotation effects due to the off - axis parabolic mirrors ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) ( as discussed above ) , the finite extinction ratio of the polarizers can still cause systematic error .",
    "note however , that the second term in eq . ( [ eq : expansion ] ) does not depend on the rotation angle @xmath77 . in this",
    "regard , two methods can be used to eliminate the systematic error . if the sample itself can be used to give a reference angle of rotation ( say at a particular temperature or magnetic field )",
    ", this reference can be subtracted to eliminate the constant term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : expansion ] ) and obtain the relative _ change _ in rotation angle .",
    "an example could be comparing a rotation measurement above and below @xmath81 in a superconductor for evidence of time reversal symmetry breaking @xcite or of a magnetic material above and below a magnetic ordering temperature . alternatively ,",
    "if an accurate reference sample can be used , the sample and reference angle scans can be subtracted , and systematic errors of this kind can be eliminated . also note that in general the contribution of @xmath82 will be small , as in the typical experimental geometry the vertically oriented photoconductive switches give an electric field which is primarily oriented along the @xmath18 direction .    up to this point",
    ", a technique has been developed and shown to be capable of measuring simple rotations .",
    "what are the ultimate capabilities of this technique , and how do they connect to full terahertz ellipsometry measurements ? to answer this question",

    "<S> in recent years , however , a number of dramatic advances in the form of _ time - domain _ thz spectroscopy ( tdts ) have helped span this gap , creating an emerging area of optical and materials research , with a broad range of applications @xcite .    photoconductive switch based tdts works by sequential excitation of source and detector semiconductor ( gaas in the present work ) structures by a femtosecond pulsed laser . </S>",

    "<S> a number of challenges remain . </S>",
    "<S> for example , highly accurate measurement of polarization states in the thz range has proven to be difficult @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> historically the highest achievable precisions in the thz or millimeter wave range have been approximately @xmath15 , measured using rotatable wire grid polarizers , with higher precisions only being achieved with extremely specialized setups @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is nowhere near the sub-@xmath2rad resolution that is possible in the near infrared and visible range @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a number of groups have developed polarization sensitive switches @xcite fabricated in a multi - pole configuration , where a single device is sensitive to two orthogonal electric field polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> this simultaneous detection of both electric field polarizations is advantageous , as the phase sensitive nature of tdts means that unlike conventional polarimetry , only two orthogonal directions have to be measured to resolve the complete jones matrix for a polarized wave .    </S>",
    "<S> although multi - pole devices @xcite and calibrated wire - grid polarizer measurements @xcite are capable of angular precision of 0.2 - 0.3@xmath16 , one might hope for even higher angular precision , as many material systems exhibit very small kerr or faraday rotations that are of fundamental interest for condensed matter physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of even higher precision thz polarimetry would also open the door for entirely new spectroscopic techniques such as thz ellipsometry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> currently the best thz ellipsometers ( based on continuous wave sources ) can not take reliable data below @xmath17 thz @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> with these ends in mind we have investigated and applied a polarization modulation technique using a fast rotator in combination with photoconductive switch based time - domain thz spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> this technique , originally developed for use with continuous wave gas lasers and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy @xcite , shows a distinct advantages when applied to tdts , namely that the phase sensitivity of tdts allows the unambiguous measurement of the jones vector polarization of a thz wave . </S>",
    "<S> the technique has recently been applied to tdts using electro - optic detection on topological insulators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when used with photoconductive switch tdts it is capable of an unprecedentedly high angular precision of better than @xmath3 , with an accuracy of @xmath1 in the frequency range from 0.1 to 1.25 thz , a sensitivity that makes entirely new classes of measurements possible . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we lay out the mathematical analysis of a polarization modulation measurement and describe initial experimental characterizations of this technique . </S>"
