    "clusters of galaxies are the largest virialized structures in the universe . tracing the distribution of these structures as a function of cosmic time provides a measurement of the growth of structure and is therefore a sensitive probe of dark energy .",
    "this method of constraining dark energy requires accurate cluster mass estimates as well as unbiased samples of clusters selected over a broad range in mass and redshift ( and with a well - defined selection function ) .",
    "there are two well - established selection techniques  optical detection of the member galaxies @xcite and x - ray detection of the hot intracluster gas @xcite  and two newer techniques weak gravitational lensing @xcite and the sunyaev - zelddovich effect ( sze , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which the cosmic microwave background is modified during its passage through the large potential wells associated with the intracluster medium .",
    "each method has its strengths and weaknesses .",
    "optical detection is capable of finding even poor clusters with relatively little observational resources , but its cluster selection function is the least well understood because the connection between mass ( whose clustering is predictable ) and galaxies is not well understood .",
    "x - ray selection is the least affected by line - of - sight projections because x - ray emissivity scales as the square of the local density , but by the same token clumpiness within the cluster changes the observable at a constant mass .",
    "sze has the advantage of being nearly redshift - independent , but large sze surveys are not yet available .",
    "lensing selection is based most directly on mass , but it is observationally difficult because galaxies _ behind _ the cluster must be imaged well enough to infer the shear induced by the cluster .",
    "whatever method is used to select the clusters , the next step is to infer cluster masses . here",
    "the nonlensing methods depend on assumptions about the dynamical state of the cluster , and lensing may be useful for calibrating the masses of subsamples . however , this is observationally easier than determining the lensing masses of individual clusters because subsamples may be stacked @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we determine lensing masses of shear - selected clusters , so hereafter we focus on the issues involved in shear selection and lensing mass determination .",
    "the weak lensing shear signal induced by a cluster is a function of its mass profile and its redshift relative to the background source galaxies being sheared , and is independent of the nature of the matter and of its dynamical or physical state .",
    "however weak lensing mass estimates do suffer from line - of - sight projections : structure along the line - of - sight could artificially boost the lensing signal or cause false positive detections .",
    "in addition poor knowledge of the source redshift distribution , as is often the case with only photometric redshift estimates , limits the accuracy of the mass estimate .",
    "we describe our choices in dealing with these issues as they arise later in the paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the selection of and previous work on these clusters in  [ sec - sample ] . in  [ sec - data ] , we summarize the data and its processing to the point of shear and photometric redshift catalogues . in  [ sec - fitting ] , we describe the fitting procedure used to estimate the masses .",
    "we present the results in  [ sec - results ] , and summarize and discuss the implications in  [ sec - discussion ] . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat universe with @xmath4 and hubble constant @xmath5 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "the deep lens survey ( dls : * ? ? ? * ) is a deep 20 deg@xmath0 @xmath6 survey conducted with the mosaic imagers @xcite on the ctio and kpno 4-m telescopes , with nominal exposure times of 18 ks in @xmath1 and 12 ks in the remaining bands .",
    "the clusters in this paper were shear - selected from the 8.6 deg@xmath0 which had at least 9 ks coverage in @xmath1 band as of march 2002 .",
    "here we briefly summarize their selection and spectroscopic and x - ray followup .",
    "we refer readers to @xcite for much more detail .",
    "@xcite ranked the shear peaks and then folded multiple peaks within a 16@xmath7  _ chandra _  acis - i field of view into candidate fields for x - ray followup .",
    "the top eight candidate fields were observed for 20 ks each with acis - i in _ chandra _",
    "ao4 , with the exception of abell 781 , which had archival _",
    "_  data . @xcite also obtained keck and ctio hydra spectroscopy of likely cluster members , for redshift confirmation and to identify any line - of - sight projections .",
    "redshifts were found to range from 0.19 to 0.68 .",
    "only one candidate ( candidate 5 ) was found to be a line - of - sight projection , on the basis of the spectroscopy and the absence of any detected x - ray emission . at the same time , most other candidates were found to contain multiple x - ray - emitting clumps , even where only one shear peak was present . in some cases , the additional extended x - ray sources correspond to extensions of the convergence map contours away from the main peak .",
    "see figures 8 to 12 and 14 to 17 in @xcite where the multiband optical imaging of each candidate , with convergence maps and x - ray contours overlaid , were presented.the maps of @xcite were not well suited to resolving multiple peaks because of the heavy smoothing , as the kernel described by @xcite is approximately equal to a gaussian with @xmath8@xmath7 . in this paper",
    ", we use the shear data to fit a mass model to each extended x - ray source .",
    "this eliminates the need for smoothing , so we expect this process to yield mass estimates even where the original maps did not show a clear peak .",
    "we also use improved shear data as described below .",
    "two of the candidates have already been published in further detail .",
    "@xcite reported the spectroscopy and strong lensing arc of candidate 8 at @xmath9 . @xcite conducted a detailed x - ray and shear - fitting analysis of candidate 1 at @xmath10 ( abell 781 ; note that the candidates are ranked by shear signal , so that abell 781 was the top candidate ) .",
    "abell 781 has multiple clumps which were fit simultaneously so as not to bias the mass estimates for individual clumps . in this paper , we present simultaneous mass profile fits to all seventeen x - ray - emitting clumps in all the candidate fields , as well as an overall fit to each candidate field .",
    "we repeat the fitting of abell 781 because @xcite used a completely different code and a slightly inferior version of the data , and we show that the two sets of results are consistent .",
    "the dls includes five widely separated 2@xmath11 by 2@xmath11 fields , labeled f1 through f5 . f1 and f2 are in the northern hemisphere and were observed with the mosaic camera @xcite on the kitt peak mayall 4-m telescope , while the remaining fields are in the south and were imaged with mosaic ii on the cerro tololo blanco 4-m telescope . each field is divided into a 3@xmath123 grid of 40@xmath7  by 40@xmath7  subfields .",
    "the imaging data set for each subfield consists of 20 dithered exposures in each of four bands ( @xmath6 ) , with each exposure lasting 900 s in @xmath1 and 600 s in the other bands .",
    "observations were done in @xmath1 when the seeing was better than 0.9@xmath13  fwhm , and galaxy shapes were measured in @xmath1 only .",
    "@xcite contains full details of the survey design .",
    "as mentioned above , the original candidate selection was done on the subfields ( totaling 8.6 deg@xmath0 ) for which at least 9 ks ( 10 exposures ) of @xmath1 band imaging had been completed by march 2002 . in this paper",
    ", we use the full imaging data set , so the data are deeper , and in some cases may extend to a larger distance from the candidate .    for each filter and subfield ,",
    "the 20 exposures were combined into a single stacked image using custom software as described in @xcite .",
    "the original images are 8192@xmath128192 pixels , with gaps between the eight ccds and a pixel size which varies over the field but averages to about 0.26@xmath13 .",
    "the stacked images are 10000@xmath1210000 pixels with a uniform pixel scale of 0.257@xmath13  and with no gaps , cosmic rays , or satellite trails .",
    "the stacked point - spread function ( psf ) size ranges from 0.8 - 0.9  in @xmath1 and from 0.9 - 1.2  in the other filters , depending on field and subfield .",
    "@xcite contains many more details on the stacking procedure .",
    "a minor improvement over the @xcite and @xcite processing is the use of a lanczos - windowed sinc function for pixel interpolation , rather than a truncated sinc function .",
    "window smoothly truncates the sinc function at its @xmath14th zero by multiplying it by another sinc function whose first zero occurs there .",
    "this also provides the useful property that the derivative of the interpolation kernel is zero at its edge . ]",
    "cataloging and photometric redshift estimation proceeded much as in @xcite .",
    "we ran sextractor on the stacked images in dual - image mode by detecting in @xmath1 and measuring in each of @xmath6 .",
    "we determined shapes of galaxies using the `` vm '' method described in @xcite .",
    "this is a partial implementation of @xcite which does not give higher weight to lower - ellipticity sources , so it should not lose accuracy in high - shear regions as does the full @xcite method .",
    "we apply a correction factor of @xmath15 to the vm shears , based on performance in the blind analysis of simulations presented by @xcite ( corrected for stellar contamination which was present in those simulations but not in these data ) , and we fold a 10% shear calibration systematic uncertainty into the cluster mass uncertainties .",
    "we used bpz @xcite to estimate photometric redshifts , using the hdf prior and template tweaking as described in ( based on the algorithm designed by @xcite ) . when compared against 328 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( _ not _ used in the template tweaking ) , the rms photometric redshift error per galaxy is @xmath16 , with a bias of @xmath17 and no catastrophic outliers over the redshift range 0.020.70 @xcite .",
    "however , these are relatively bright galaxies , and we expect that performance is worse for the more typical faint galaxies used in the shear fitting .",
    "we address that concern in ",
    "[ sec : pz ] below .    for each subfield",
    ", we matched the shape and photometric redshift catalogs , eliminating galaxies which failed one or the other procedure , and then applied masks around bright stars .",
    "we also cut sources with extremely large or exactly zero errors on the measured ellipticity , indicating a problem with the ellipticity measurement ; saturated sources ; and sources with a photometric redshift greater than 1.6 .",
    "we imposed the latter cut because photometric redshift performance is predicted to be poor after the 4000 angstrom break is shifted through the @xmath18 filter , and we have no spectroscopy in that redshift range to evaluate how it degrades .",
    "finally , we stitched together the nine subfields in each field , checking that object attributes in the overlap regions were consistent and that no objects were duplicated .",
    "the observed reduced shear components , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are calculated from the measured ellipticities of the source galaxies @xmath21 and @xmath22 by dividing by the shear responsivity correction @xmath23 : @xmath24 .",
    "we fit a model for the mass distribution of each cluster to the observed shear components , taking into account the full three - dimensional position of each source galaxy ( r.a . ,",
    ", photo - z ) .",
    "we refer to each shear - selected cluster as a candidate and each x - ray detection within the vicinity of a candidate position as a  clump \" .",
    "the x - ray positions give a better indication of a cluster center than the shear peak position because the x - ray centroids are more precise statistically .",
    "_ chandra _ has 0.5@xmath13angular resolution , while the convergence maps have @xmath25@xmath7  resolution .",
    "we number the candidates from 1 to 8 and label the x - ray clumps in their vicinity with lowercase letters . where there are multiple shear peaks ( which have x - ray confirmation ) within what could be considered a single candidate , we label them with uppercase letters .",
    "for each clump the r.a . and dec .",
    "positions are given by the x - ray position , and the redshift is given by a spectroscopic measurement , except for clumps 2b , 2c and 7c .",
    "the photometric redshifts of these clumps are consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts of the main clump in their respective fields , so in these cases we use the main clump spectroscopic redshift . the information on the clusters according to the labelling described above is presented in table [ tb - clusters ] .",
    "note that table 2 of @xcite contains a typographical error in the position of candidate 1 ; the correct position for the candidate field is 09:20:50 + 30:27:44 ( j2000 ) .",
    ".top 8 shear - selected clusters from dls .",
    "the clumps within each candidate are listed in order of decreasing x - ray flux .",
    "[ tb - clusters ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     = 0.4 cm      the results from the multi - profile fit , described in section [ sec : mm ] item ( ii ) , are shown in table [ tb : mc ] .",
    "candidates 4 and 6 only had one x - ray peak so only one profile is fitted , but now the profile center position is set as exactly the x - ray peak position .",
    "the masses and 1@xmath26 uncertainties in table  [ tb : mc ] are quoted after marginalization over the masses of any other clumps within the candidate field .",
    "figure [ fig : smcomp ] shows the relationship between the masses from the single profile fit and multi - profile fit , with nfw results at left and sis results at right . comparing the two panels , we see that switching from single to multiple fits lowered the sis mass estimates more than it lowered the nfw mass estimates .",
    "this suggests empirically that the nfw profile is less susceptible to shear from the neighboring clumps , a suggestion which is supported mathematically by the greater steepness of the nfw profile at larger radii .",
    "we now examine the effect of single vs. multiple fits on individual clusters .",
    "candidates 1 and 2 , with the most x - ray - emitting clumps ( four ) , are the two with significantly lower masses in the multi - profile fit as compared to the single - profile fit .",
    "this is simply due to the shear of the neighboring clumps contributing `` mass '' to the single - profile fit .",
    "candidates 7 and 8 , with three and two x - ray - emitting clumps respectively , also have lower masses with the simultaneous - fitting approach , but this effect is not significant given their larger uncertainties . for the remainder , the mass estimates did not decrease with the simultaneous - fitting approach ; of these , only candidate 3 had more than one x - ray - emitting clump .",
    "collectively , the single - clump candidates saw their masses _ increase _ slightly with the second approach .",
    "although this is not a very significant effect , it may follow from the one element of the algorithm which changed , namely , that positions are fixed to the x - ray positions rather than marginalized over .",
    "the small difference between the two results implies that the x - ray peak position was a good proxy for the cluster center position , and that we did not marginalize over too large an area .",
    "the striking effect of clump multiplicity demonstrates that care must be taken not to introduce a systematic error in the measured cluster masses due to the presence of nearby shear peaks .",
    "it also implies that there could be significant systematic errors from nearby undetected masses .",
    "we now compare our results to previously published mass estimates .",
    "there is a dramatic change in candidate 8 .",
    "recall the single - profile fit result of @xmath27 presented in table  [ tb : sc ] was higher than , but consistent with , the corrected @xcite result of @xmath28 .",
    "when we simultaneously fit the additional extended x - ray source in the field , the additional source is assigned most of the mass , @xmath29 , and the main source is left with only @xmath30 .",
    "the reason is unclear : the main source has a larger x - ray flux by a factor of 1.4 despite being at a higher redshift ( @xmath9 vs. 0.61 ) .",
    "the dynamical and strong - lensing mass estimates in @xcite were also consistent with the higher mass , and can not be affected by the secondary cluster at lower redshift .",
    "it could be argued that those estimates do not strongly rule out the lower mass estimate , given the small number of members with spectroscopy ( 17 ) and the unknown redshift of the strongly lensed arc .",
    "hence , a complete understanding of this system may require more data , in the form of an arc redshift , _",
    "hubble space telescope _ imaging for a higher - resolution weak lensing analysis , and/or more spectroscopy .    the second system with previously published mass estimates is abell 781 , for which @xcite simultaneously fit nfw profiles to clumps 1a ( which they called the `` main '' cluster ) , 1b ( which they called the `` middle '' cluster ) , and 1c ( which they called the `` east '' cluster ) .",
    "our simultaneously - fit nfw masses are consistent with theirs .",
    "although table [ tb : mc ] gives the impression that the new results are systematically somewhat lower , the total discrepancy of the three clumps is only about one in terms of @xmath31 , for three degrees of freedom .",
    "this is not significant .",
    "the velocity dispersions inferred from the multiple simultaneous sis fits also agree with the spectroscopic velocity dispersions measured by @xcite . when the shear fits are not simultaneous ( table  [ tb : sc ] ) , the inferred velocity dispersions are significantly overstimated .",
    "finally , we compare the results between the two different profiles , sis and nfw , for all the measured masses ( figure [ fig : compfit ] ) . only the masses of candidates 1a and 1b from the multiple profile",
    "fit have more than a 1@xmath26 discrepancy between the two profile types ; their sis masses are lower than their nfw masses by about 2@xmath26 .",
    "when the clumps are not fit simultaneously ( blue points ) , masses inferred from the two profiles are in excellent agreement . given the greater susceptibility of the sis to boosting by neighbors , we expect a shift in this direction , but we would have expected the non - simultaneous fits to lie _ above _ the unity - slope relation rather than _ on _ it .",
    "given that these are the two highest - shear clumps in the survey , this somewhat unexpected behavior may be indicating that high - mass neighbors induce additional subtle effects not accounted for by merely simultaneous fitting ( for example , magnification changing the source redshift distribution ) .",
    "figure [ fig : compfit ] also suggests that the nfw profile tends to assign more mass to the candidate ; nearly all the multiple - profile points lie below the line of unity slope . for the single - profile fits",
    ", this effect seems to be nearly cancelled by the tendency of the sis to pull in more neighboring mass .",
    "we investigated this observation with data simulated using an nfw profile .",
    "we fitted the data with both sis and nfw profiles and then compared the masses measured from both profiles .",
    "we found instead that fitting the sis profile caused a slight over - estimation of the true mass , but this was insignificant given the size of the statistical errors .",
    "the over - estimation was due to the inner regions of the profile having more weight in the fitting , and in these regions the sis density is less than the nfw density for the same mass .",
    "therefore it is possible the reason why the nfw profile seems to assign more mass to the cluster than the sis profile lies within the ( unknown ) exact details of the true density profile of clusters at these inner radii .",
    "this is reasonable because the shape of the cluster density profile at the lowest radii is the most uncertain .",
    "the nfw profile is predicted by cold dark matter only simulations , and would be affected at low radii by the baryonic cluster component , the existence of massive neutrinos or even the possibility that the dark matter has a non - zero cross - section .",
    "we have measured the masses of a sample of shear - selected clusters from the deep lens survey by fitting nfw and sis profiles to the full dataset of shears and source redshifts . for each type of profile",
    ", we fit the data in two different ways : ( i ) we fit to each _ shear peak separately _ , marginalizing over likely locations of the mass profile center ; ( ii ) we fit to all the _ extended x - ray sources simultaneously _ , fixing the mass profile locations at those of the x - ray peaks .",
    "we find that :    * masses measured with either profile are consistent with each other on a per - cluster basis .",
    "this is because the two profiles are similar to each other at the cluster radii probed by the weak lensing .",
    "there are hints that the nfw profile tends to assign more mass on average , but a larger and higher - s / n sample would be required to confirm this .",
    "the same tendency was found by @xcite , who studied 22 clusters with weak lensing signal measured from subaru / suprime - cam imaging data . * fitting multiple clumps simultaneously can yield a much lower mass estimate compared to fitting them separately .",
    "this is because the single - profile fit conflates shear from nearby peaks with shear from the peak being fit .",
    "the size of this effect was a factor of about 1.5 to 2 for abell 781 and for candidate 2 . * uncertainty in the mass profile center had a relatively small effect here , but should not be overlooked . for the candidates with a single extended x - ray source , the _",
    "only _ difference between approaches ( i ) and ( ii ) was the marginalization over , vs. fixing of , the mass profile center , and the results did not change dramatically .",
    "there was a shift in the sense that marginalizing over possible centers did yield lower mass estimates , but it was small compared to the typical per - cluster uncertainty here . while adequate for the current purpose , with larger samples this may become a nontrivial systematic issue . especially since we find from simplified simulations that a small offset of just 0.4 arcminutes could cause a systematic bias on the mass if the precision of the statistical errors is greater than 5 per cent",
    "more investigation into the typical bcg / x - ray and mass peak position offsets is required to make sure this systematic is fully under control .",
    "* a few clusters have masses which are consistent or nearly consistent with zero .",
    "although several effects may be contributing , the most likely is that the original shear selection , having been done without regard to source redshifts , was vulnerable to line - of - sight projections in a way that the current fitting technique is not .",
    "this problem may have been compounded by the heavy smoothing in the @xcite convergence maps . as shown by the spectroscopy and x - ray detections in @xcite , these are real clusters , but they may be so poor that they passed the selection only because of nearby projections .",
    "tomographic selection should reduce this problem , but , according to the simulations of @xcite , can not eliminate it .",
    "followup spectroscopy and/or x - ray observations can prove that a cluster exists at that location , but much more extensive ( perhaps prohibitive ) followup would be required to prove that that are no additional groups projected nearby that boosted the cluster into the sample .",
    "an alternative would be to think of these systems simply as shear peaks rather than clusters , and use the formalism of @xcite or @xcite to constrain cosmology .",
    "comparing to previous mass estimates of some of these systems , we find that abell 781 is entirely consistent .",
    "however , candidate 8 is more puzzling than previously thought ; the new fits indicate that the secondary x - ray peak has more mass than the primary one .",
    "more data may be required to fully understand this system .",
    "simulations suggest that the ellipticity of clusters could be used as a cosmological probe , if sufficiently good statistics can be obtained @xcite .",
    "observations do suggest that cluster shapes , measured by the distribution of galaxies , x - rays , sz effect and weak lensing , are usually not spherical .",
    "there is also indication that the mean ellipticity evolves with redshift @xcite , with clusters becoming less elliptical over time .",
    "this is expected because of hierarchical cluster formation and the reduced merger rate as clusters undergo a relaxation process .",
    "the systematic ellipticity of cluster dark matter halos was recently detected by stacking hundreds of clusters in sdss @xcite .",
    "an extension to the current paper would be therefore , to allow the individual clumps to be fitted with an elliptical profile instead of an axi - symmetric one .",
    "this may reduce the number of clumps required in the fit , or produce more realistic mass estimates for the individual clumps .",
    "however the ellipticity of clusters is difficult to measure for individual systems ( although see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to the high noise levels on individual shear measurements .",
    "@xcite looked at the resulting biases on the cluster mass function from fitting a spherical model to both spherical and elliptical ( triaxial ) halos after stacking the lensing signals of many clusters binned by mass - correlated observables .",
    "they fitted a circular model to the stack of elliptical halos and measured @xmath32 in a circular contour and found that this did not match with the @xmath32 values of the original individual halos , if this @xmath32 was calculated in elliptical isodensity contours .",
    "however they found that the stacked @xmath32 matched well to the @xmath32 of the individual halos , if the @xmath32 values of the original elliptical halos were defined using circular contours instead , where the density at different points around these circular contours was not constant .",
    "we performed a simulation to test this effect on a per - cluster basis .",
    "the clusters in @xcite were stacked without attention to aligning their axes , so the random orientations of many halos in each bin would artificially circularise the average of the stacked halos . in our simulations",
    "we calculate the difference between ( i ) the mass obtained from fitting a circular model and ( ii ) the mass within the circle containing @xmath33 of the best - fit elliptical model .",
    "we find these two numbers are the same to better than 1 per cent accuracy . therefore we conclude that there is negligible systematic bias in our results from fitting a spherical profile to an elliptical halo as long as @xmath32 in circular radii is the quantity of interest .",
    "many different cluster surveys will be taking place in the near future",
    ". they will aim to probe the growth of structure over time , beginning a new genre of cosmological analysis .",
    "understanding the sample selection and relating the cluster observables to the mass is a large task .",
    "shear selection in principle eases this task because it is independent of the nature of the matter and of its dynamical state , but there are clearly several issues which must be resolved , principally the observationally difficult task of accounting for projections , but also including determination of the mass profile center without biasing the mass estimate . in the future , large surveys such as the large - aperture synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) will find on the order of 100,000 shear - selected clusters @xcite . with such massive surveys systematics will become important .",
