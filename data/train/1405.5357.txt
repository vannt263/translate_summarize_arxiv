    "in this paper we investigate the role of quantum correlation in quantum metrology .",
    "the best suited measure of quantum correlation , which laid the basis of investigation , is the one based on quantum fisher information originally introduced in @xcite .",
    "as the quantum fisher information represents the quantum speed of evolution , when the geometric distance in the quantum state space is expressed in terms of bures metric , the quantum correlation can be interpreted from quantum dynamical perspective .",
    "thus the measure of quantum correlation becomes identified with the minimal speed of evolution over all possible local unitaries .",
    "this dynamical approach to quantify quantum correlation provides us the premise to study quantum metrology in the presence of quantum correlation .",
    "the quantum correlation measure gives the lowest bound on the error in quantum metrology , when the experiment is performed on one of the sub - systems .",
    "an upper bound on the error is also derived analytically . for quantum metrology with multi - party quantum systems , we show that not only the entanglement but also the quantum correlation plays important roles in enhancing precision in quantum metrology . even in the absence of entanglement , quantum correlation can be exploited to go beyond sql and attain hl .",
    "the very reason for better precision is the constructive interference between the local unitary evolutions , resulting in larger quantum fisher information and that happens only in the presence of quantum correlation .",
    "it is also possible to have destructive interference , in the presence of quantum correlation , to make the resultant quantum fisher information very small or even zero .",

    "<S> our analysis shows that not only the entanglement but also the quantum correlation plays important roles to enhance precision in quantum metrology . even in the absence of entanglement , quantum correlation can be exploited as the resource to beat standard quantum limit and reach heisenberg limit in metrology . clearly unraveling the role of quantum correlations , </S>",
