    "the advent of large scale cluster survey programs @xcite will soon provide large catalogs of galaxy clusters to test the standard cosmological scenario based on the cold dark matter paradigm with cosmological constant ( @xmath0cdm ) .",
    "galaxy clusters are the largest observable structures in the universe which reside inside massive dark matter ( dm ) halos .",
    "these are gravitationally bound objects that result from the gravitational collapse of small matter density fluctuations which were present in the early universe . because of this the number density of dm halos carries complementary information on both the statistics of the primordial matter density field and the growth rate of structures .",
    "measurements of the abundance of cluster of galaxies aim to probe such features , but their effectiveness to constrain cosmological models depends upon the precise understanding of the survey selection function @xcite as well as the availability of accurate measurements of cluster masses ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , measuring the mass of several hundreds of clusters is a challenging task that requires costly follow - up observations of individual objects , thus inevitably spanning these projects over long periods of time . while completing these programs ,",
    "cosmological information can still be inferred from reduced datasets consisting of the most massive objects .",
    "these probe the high - mass end of the halo mass function and thus have the potential to rule out entire classes of cosmological models .",
    "the advantage is that such systems , being also the most luminous , are easier to detect and being limited in number makes their follow - up observations more readily accessible .    in recent years",
    "this complementary approach to cluster cosmology has received lots of attention due to the discovery of very massive clusters at high - redshift @xcite .",
    "these detections have lead several authors to question the basic assumptions of the concordance @xmath0cdm model @xcite .",
    "however , estimating the probability that such extreme clusters occur is far from being trivial .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite assessing the rareness of clusters in terms of the probability of observing at least one cluster of mass larger than that observed and/or at a higher redshift can lead to biased conclusions .",
    "a natural framework to address these questions is given by the extreme value statistics ( evs ) .",
    "this can be used to predict the probability distribution of the mass of the most massive halo in the sample from prior knowledge of the halo mass function in a given cosmological model .",
    "this has been the subject of several studies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which have focused on the mass as measure of cluster extremeness .",
    "however , a careful analysis of the most massive systems so far observed suggests that there are other characteristics that are indicative of the extremeness of these objects .",
    "for instance , 1e0657 - 56 @xcite , macs j0025.4 - 1222",
    "@xcite , act - cl @xcite and as1063 @xcite are merging clusters with high relative velocities . among these",
    "1e0657 - 56 is one of the most well documented .",
    "known as the `` bullet cluster '' , it is composed of two clusters which have undergone a nearly head on collision . the main cluster has a mass @xmath1 h@xmath2 m@xmath3 , while the smaller one has mass @xmath4 h@xmath2 m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the system is located at @xmath5 @xcite and the clusters are separated by a distance of .",
    "x - ray observations have shown that the collision has ripped off the clusters of their intra - cluster gas which is trapped in a shock with mach number close to @xmath6 .",
    "this implies a velocity of the shock front of @xcite , which has been usually interpreted as being also the relative velocity of the colliding clusters . under this hypothesis",
    "@xcite analysed the velocities of the sub - halo distribution from the millenium simulation @xcite and concluded that the existence of the bullet cluster is consistent with the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "however , due to the limited volume of millenium simulation their result do not rely on direct measurement but rather on extrapolating the sub - halo velocity probability distribution to host halos with mass @xmath7 h@xmath2 m@xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , the relative velocity of the colliding clusters may well be different from that of the gas . as shown by @xcite using 2-d hydrodynamical simulations this can be up to @xmath8 smaller",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "to date the most detailed study of the bullet cluster has been performed by @xcite who have used 3-d non - cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to determine the initial physical configurations of the colliding clusters resulting in a system whose properties reproduce those observed in the bullet cluster .",
    "these include the displacement between the x - ray peaks and the mass distribution , the morphology of the shock velocity , the surface brightness and the projected temperature profiles across the shock .",
    "@xcite have shown that the colliding halos must have an initial velocity with a mass ratio of @xmath9 , an initial separation of @xmath10 mpc ( implying an initial redshift of @xmath11 ) and a collision angle @xmath12 close to 0 ( i.e. head on collision ) .",
    "the identification of these parameters has provided criteria to select bullet - like halo pairs in cosmological simulations , a crucial step to estimate the probability of finding the bullet cluster in a given cosmological setup .",
    "@xcite analysed the halo catalog from the mice simulations @xcite of @xmath0cdm cosmology at @xmath13 and @xmath14 to infer the pairwise velocities probability distribution for different mass ratios , distance separation and relative velocity .",
    "quite remarkably they found that none of the analysed catalogues contains a system with parameters corresponding to that of the bullet cluster .",
    "nevertheless , by fitting the probability density distribution to a gaussian , they were able to extrapolate the probability to high relative velocities .",
    "they found the rate of occurrence of bullet cluster - like systems to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 at @xmath13 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "@xcite performed a similar analysis of a set of @xmath0cdm simulations with dm mass resolution varying from 9@xmath18 to 5.7@xmath19 h@xmath2 m@xmath3 and box sizes ranging from @xmath20 h@xmath2 mpc to @xmath21 h@xmath2 gpc . by extrapolating the cumulative distribution to high relative velocities these authors obtained @xmath22 at @xmath23 for masses @xmath24 m@xmath3 .",
    "these probabilities imply that in the observable cosmic volume the existence of the bullet cluster pair is either incompatible with the @xmath0cdm scenario or as argued by @xcite that the initial conditions determined from the analysis of non - cosmological hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite have to be revised to much lower values of v@xmath25 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent study ) .",
    "a critical point is that all these analyses rely on extrapolating the tail of the pairwise velocity probability distribution to high - velocities .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the limited volumes of the numerical simulations from which these results have been derived .",
    "furthermore , the probability of observing the bullet cluster has been directly estimated from the tail of the probability density distribution fitted to a gaussian which may suffer of potential biases especially if the tail of the distribution is non - gaussian .    in the work presented here",
    "we improve these studies in several ways .",
    "we use the catalog of halos from the dark energy universe simulation - full universe runs ( deus - fur ) which cover the entire observable cosmic volume with a box - length of @xmath26h@xmath2 gpc and @xmath27 dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "these simulations provide an unprecedented large statistical sample to test the rareness of halo properties for different cosmological models .",
    "the large simulation volume allows us to perform a detailed analysis of the pairwise velocity especially in the high - velocity tail .",
    "building upon this study we use the extreme value statistics ( evs ) to quantify the probability of observing the bullet cluster .",
    "this enables us for the first time to perform a cosmological model comparison of the bullet cluster observation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we introduce the n - body simulation data , the halo finder algorithm and the halo pair selection method . in section",
    "[ dndv_fof ] , we described the dependence of the pairwise velocity function on the halo finder parameter and discuss the physical implications , while in section [ sec_cosmoz ] we study the redshift evolution and cosmology dependence . in section [ evsbull ]",
    "we introduce the extreme value statistics and present the results of its application to the bullet cluster .",
    "finally in section [ conclu ] we discuss our conclusions .",
    "we use numerical data issued from the deus - fur project .",
    "this consists of three n - body simulations with @xmath27 dark matter particles and box size of enclosing the observable volume of a flat @xmath0cdm cosmology and two dark energy models with different expansion histories .",
    "the simulations have been realized using the application amadeus - a multi - purpose application for dark energy universe simulation - expressly developed for the deus - fur project @xcite .",
    "this includes the generator of gaussian initial conditions for which we use an optimized version of the code mpgrafic @xcite , the n - body solver which is a version of the ramses code @xcite specifically improved to run on a large number of cores ( mpi tasks in production mode ) and an optimized friend - of - friend halo finder @xcite .",
    "ramses solves the vlasov - poisson equations using an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) particle mesh method with the poisson equation solved with a multigrid technique @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the algorithms , optimization schemes and the computing challenges involved with the realization of deus - fur is given in @xcite .",
    "all simulations share the same phase of the initial conditions .",
    "the coarse grid of the amr hierarchy contains @xmath27 resolution elements and is allowed to refined six times , reaching a formal spatial resolution of 40 h@xmath2 kpc , while the particle mass resolution for the different models is .",
    "such resolution roughly corresponds to the size and mass of the milky way ."
