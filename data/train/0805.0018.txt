    "it is by now widely accepted that hydrodynamics is a successful approach for describing the collective flow in high - energy nuclear collisions .",
    "the basic assumption in hydrodynamical models is the local thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is assumed that , after a complex process involving microscopic collisions of nuclear constituents , at a certain early instant a hot and dense matter is formed , which would be in local thermal equilibrium .",
    "usually , this state is characterized by some initial conditions ( ic ) , parametrized as smooth distributions of thermodynamic quantities and four - velocity .",
    "after this instant , the system would evolve hydrodynamically , following the well known set of differential equations .",
    "however , since our systems are not large , important event - by - event fluctuations are expected in real collisions . concerning this question , fluctuation in the ic",
    "deserves a special consideration . in the past few years",
    ", we have studied several effects caused by such fluctuating ic on observables , by using a computational code especially developed for this purpose , which we call nexspherio @xcite . in particular , in @xcite we have studied the fluctuations of the so called elliptic flow parameter @xmath0 , showing that they are quite large , which has been confirmed by recent data @xcite .",
    "our more recent computations gave similar results @xcite .",
    "an important point with regard to such ic for high - energy nuclear collisions is that they are not only event - by - event fluctuating , but also are strongly inhomogeneous in space .",
    "since the incident nuclei are not smooth objects , if the thermalization is verified at very early time as usually assumed in hydrodynamic approach , _ they could not be smooth but should have granular structure_. in the present work , we focus our attention mainly to such a _ granular structure _ of fluctuating ic and try to show important effects on some observables , especially on the elliptic - flow parameter @xmath0 .    in what follows",
    ", we will first give a brief discussion on _ what is expected if such hot blobs are produced_. this will be done in the next section .",
    "we shall then describe in section  [ ns ] , our main tool , the nexspherio code .",
    "we show the results of computations in section  [ results ] , first on transverse - momentum ( @xmath1 ) spectra , and then on @xmath2 as function both of pseudo - rapidity @xmath3 and of @xmath4 .",
    "finally , main conclusions are drawn in sec.[conclusions ] .",
    "what do we expect if the ic present granular structure as depicted in fig.@xmath5[blobs]@xmath5 ? because of high concentration of energy in _ point - like _ regions , we imagine that initially each blob would suffer a violent explosion and , because of their small size , isotropically . if one of such blobs is deep inside the hot matter , this initial motion is quickly absorbed by the surrounding medium , so would not result in any observable effect . however , if such a blob is at the surface of the matter , certainly the outgoing part of this initial acceleration would remain producing high-@xmath1 particles , which would be isotropically distributed in the momentum space .",
    "thus , first we expect that high-@xmath1 part of the @xmath1 spectra is enhanced when fluctuating ic are used in our computations , in comparison with the results with averaged ( smooth ) ic . in the second place",
    ", we expect that the anisotropic - flow coefficient @xmath0 suffers reduction as we go to high-@xmath1 region , due to the additional high-@xmath1 isotropic component included now . as for the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath2 , we know that the average matter density decreases as @xmath6 increases as reflected in the @xmath3 distribution of charged particles , so when such a blob is formed in the large-@xmath6 regions , its effects appear more clearly .",
    "therefore , we expect considerable reduction of @xmath2 in those regions .",
    "although not discussed here , the granular structure we are considering certainly affect the so - called hbt radii .",
    "this question has been discussed in a previous publication @xcite .",
    "our fundamental tool for the present study is called nexspherio .",
    "it is a junction of two computational codes : nexus and spherio .",
    "the nexus code @xcite is used to compute the ic : @xmath7 and @xmath8 on some initial hypersurface .",
    "it is a microscopic model based on the regge - gribov theory and the main advantage for our purpose is that , once a pair of incident nuclei or hadrons and their incident energy are chosen , it can produce , in the event - by - event basis , detailed space distributions of energy - momentum tensor , baryon - number , strangeness and charge densities , at a given initial time @xmath9fm . remark that , when we use a microscopic model to create a set of ic for hydrodynamics , the generated energy - momentum tensor does not necessarily correspond to that of local equilibrium , so we need to transform it to that of the equilibrated matter , adopting some procedure as described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ ic ] an example of such a fluctuating event , produced by nexus event generator , for central au  +  au collision at @xmath10gev , compared with an average over 30 events .",
    "as can be seen , the energy - density distribution for a single event ( left ) , at the mid - rapidity plane , presents several blobs of high - density matter , whereas in the averaged ic ( right ) the distribution is smoothed out , even though the number of events is only 30 .",
    "the latter would corresponds to the usually adopted smooth and symmetrical ic in many hydrodynamic calculations . the bumpy event structure , as exhibited in fig .  [ ic ] ,",
    "was also shown in calculations with hijing  @xcite and other event generators .",
    "as already observed there and studied in @xcite , this bumpy structure gives important consequences in the observables .",
    "as for the velocity distribution , it gives essentially zero transverse velocity and longitudinal component close to the boost - invariant one .",
    "solving the hydrodynamic equations for events , so irregular as the one shown in fig  [ ic ] , requires a special care .",
    "the spherio code is well suited to computing the hydrodynamic evolution of such systems .",
    "it is based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , an algorithm originally developed in astrophysics @xcite and adapted to relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "it parametrizes the flow in terms of discrete lagrangian coordinates attached to small volumes ( called `` particles '' ) with some conserved quantities .",
    "its main advantage is that any geometry in the initial conditions can be incorporated and this is done giving a desired precision .",
    "now , we have to specify some equation of state ( eos ) describing the locally equilibrated matter . here , in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite , we will adopt a phenomenological implementation of eos , giving a critical end point in the quark - gluon plasma - hadron gas transition line , as suggested by the lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "we shall neglect in this paper any dissipative effects and also assume the usual sudden freezeout at a constant temperature .",
    "as for the conserved quantities , besides the energy , momentum and entropy , we consider just the baryon number .",
    "although very simplified , we believe that the main outcomes of the present study will remain valid in more detailed description .",
    "in computing several observables , we perform in the present work two sets of computations : i ) first , we average over random nexus events , obtaining smooth ic , which are used to compute the observables by using the spherio code .",
    "this is similar to the usual hydro calculation .",
    "ii ) in the second set , nexspherio is run many times and an average over final results is performed .",
    "this mimics experimental conditions more closely .",
    "remark that in the latter the granular structure of ic , mentioned above , are being explicitly included whereas in the former not .    having depicted our tool , let us now explain how we fix the parameters of the model and compute the observables of our interest . certainly any model to be considered as such should reproduce the most fundamental , global quantities involving the class of phenomena for which it is proposed .",
    "so , we begin by fixing the initial conditions so as to reproduce properly the ( pseudo-)rapidity distributions of charged particles in each centrality window .",
    "this is done by applying an @xmath3-dependent factor @xmath11 to the initial energy density distribution of all the events of each centrality class , produced by nexus .",
    "next , we would like to correctly reproduce the transverse - momentum spectra of charged particles , which can be achieved by choosing an appropriate centrality dependent freezeout temperature , @xmath12 .",
    "we show in fig.@xmath5[dndpt]@xmath5 , our results for the charged - particle spectra in two different centrality windows as indicated , computed as explained in section [ ns ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that , as one goes from the smooth averaged ic to bumpy fluctuating ic , the high-@xmath1 component of the spectra increases as expected , making them more concave and closer to the data .",
    "distributions , in two different centrality windows , computed in two different ways as explained in the text .",
    "the solid lines indicate results for event - by - event fluctuating ic , whereas the dotted lines the ones for the averaged ic .",
    "the data points are also plotted for comparison @xcite . ]      in fig.@xmath5[v2pt]@xmath5 , we show our results for the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath13 in the centrality window and @xmath3 interval as indicated . here , since our purpose is to show clearly the effects of granular ic , we plot the results obtained with the same phobos hit - based method for the both curves , but without any correction for event - plane fluctuations . while the result with smooth averaged ic shows continuous increase of @xmath13 with @xmath4 , deviating largely from the data points , as happens in the orthodox hydro computations , the introduction of spiky ic makes @xmath0 smaller at high @xmath1 as expected , approaching the curve to the data points .",
    "the correction mentioned above shifts upward the curve , corresponding to the fluctuating ic , but without modifying its shape .",
    "the fact that the averaged smooth ic lead to rising @xmath14 for large @xmath1 and not flattening is usually interpreted as a breakdown of hydrodynamic model .",
    "we suggest it could be in part related to the granular structure of the ic .",
    "dependence of @xmath13 in the centrality window and @xmath3 interval as indicated , compared with data @xcite .",
    "the solid line indicates result for fluctuating ic , whereas the dotted one that for the averaged ic .",
    "the curves are averages over phobos centrality sub - intervals with freeze - out temperatures as indicated . ]      in fig.@xmath5[v2eta]@xmath5 , we show our results for the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath13 in three different centrality windows as indicated . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculated @xmath13 with respect to the event plane as done experimentally .",
    "the event plane has been determined here by all the charged particles ( the results with the phobos hit - based method with correction are almost identical ) . for averaged smooth ic , in agreement with the usual hydro computations @xcite",
    ", @xmath13 exhibits shoulders in high-@xmath6 regions . when fluctuating spiky ic are used , these shoulders are considerably weakened as expected .",
    "the results , which combine this and the complementary effect of increase of @xmath13 with the event - plane fluctuations , are now very close to the data .",
    "dependence of @xmath13 for three centrality windows .",
    "the solid lines indicate results for event - by - event fluctuating ic , whereas the dotted lines the ones for the averaged ic .",
    "the data points are also plotted for comparison @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 has been taken as indicated in fig.[v2pt ] . ]",
    "another important ingredient of a hydrodynamic model is the decoupling procedure .",
    "we are studying the effect of _ continuous emission _",
    "probably it makes the curve of @xmath0 at high-@xmath1 even flatter and the @xmath3-distribution narrower @xcite .",
    "this is clear , also in refs .",
    "@xcite , where they use the usual smooth ic and , by describing the decoupling with a microscopic transport model , could improve @xmath0 in this direction . the cascade model in the hadronic stage",
    "produces similar effects as the continuous emission .",
    "while it is believed that a granular structure exists in the ic , hydro simulations are usually done with smooth ic , the expectation being that the granularity will not manifest itself . in this paper , we argue that this may not be true qualitatively and also quantitatively .      1",
    ".   granular structure in the ic produces more high-@xmath1 particles , distributed isotropically .",
    "granular structure in the ic reduces the elliptic flow , because of the isotropic flow it generates .",
    "3 .   as function of @xmath1 ,",
    "the mechanism becomes more effective as @xmath1 increases , because those high - density blobs cause violent expansion , producing high-@xmath1 particles .",
    "this effect is enhanced where the average matter density is small .",
    "so , it decreases @xmath0 in the large pseudorapidity regions .",
    "nexspherio , with fluctuating and spiky ic , reproduce approximately the data both of the @xmath1-distribution and @xmath3-distribution of @xmath0 for different centrality windows .",
