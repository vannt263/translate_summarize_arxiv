    "the low - mass x  ray binary system 4u162667  is formed by a neutron star pulsating at about 7.7  s @xcite and orbiting the faint blue star kz  tra @xcite .",
    "this system shows the lowest mass function ever observed @xcite , putting severe constraints on the nature of the optical companion : the most likely is a 0.020.06 @xmath5 degenerate he or co dwarf @xcite .",
    "the determination of the 4u162667  orbital period have always been problematic : attempts to find doppler delays in the x  ray pulse arrival times have always been unsuccessful , but photometric studies of the optical companion revealed the presence of two periods : one at the x  ray pulsation frequency @xcite and another down - shifted by about 0.4 mhz with respect to the first @xcite .",
    "assuming that the optical emission is due to the reprocessing of the x  ray emission on the surface of the companion , a binary period of about 2500  s and a projected semi - major axis of 0.4 lt - s are inferred @xcite .",
    "the _ bepposax _  satellite includes two wide field cameras sensitive in the 230 kev range @xcite , and four narrow field instruments ( nfis ) sensitive in 0.110 kev ( lecs @xcite ) , 110 kev ( mecs @xcite ) , 3180 kev ( hpgspc @xcite ) , and 15300 kev ( pds @xcite ) .",
    "it is a program of the italian space agency ( asi ) , with participation of the netherlands agency for aerospace programs ( nivr ) .    during the science verification phase a series of well known x ",
    "ray sources were observed in order to check the capabilities and performances of the instruments on - board _",
    "bepposax_. 4u162667  is one of these sources and it was observed from august 9 00:10:35 to august 11 00:00:05 utc @xcite .",
    "data were telemetred in direct modes , which provide complete information on time , energy and , if available , position for each photon .",

    "a high energy cutoff at @xmath47 kev is also necessary to describe the high energy data @xcite .",
    "this spectral function describes very well our data , both the single _ bepposax _  nfis spectra , and the broad - band spectrum .",
    "we used the standard x  ray pulsar cutoff of the form @xmath48 $ ] , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the cutoff and folding energy , respectively .",
    "the smoother fermi - dirac cutoff did not adequately describe the high energy tail .",
    "after the inclusion of the ne line complex at 1 kev @xcite we obtained a best fit with a reduced  of 1.482 for 348 degrees of freedom ( dof ) . from the analysis of the residuals",
    "we were led to add a cyclotron resonance feature ( crf ) at @xmath51 kev .",
    "both a lorenzian or a gaussian in absorption model improved the fit , yielding s of 1.122 and 1.258 for 345 dof , respectively .",
    "an f - test shows that the improvement is significant at 99.99% .",
    "the fit results are summarized in table  [ tab : fit ] @xcite .",
    "the search for a possible crf at @xmath52 kev , as suggested by pravdo @xcite , was unsuccessful .",
    "the two crf models are equivalent : the probability of chance improvement from the lorenzian to the gaussian model is 30% . however , we prefer the gaussian description of the crf , because the cutoff energy in the lorenzian fit is too close to the resonance energy .",
    "as it is evident from table  [ tab : fit ] , the lorenzian model approximates the fall - off of the spectrum by increasing the cutoff energy , and shifting the cyclotron energy at values lower than those obtained by an absorption gaussian .",
    "this is a known effect already observed for the crf in her x-1 @xcite and vela x1 @xcite .",
    "our data do not show the presence of an iron k - shell line in 6.46.9 kev : the upper limit on its equivalent width is 21 ev , slightly more stringent than the 33 ev value obtained by asca @xcite .",
    "the total 0.1100 kev x  ray luminosity is @xmath53 erg  s@xmath54  d@xmath55 .",
    "the fluxes in the bands 0.510 and 10100 kev are @xmath56 and @xmath57 ergs  @xmath8  s@xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the pulse period referred to the solar system barycenter is @xmath58  s , in agreement with batse results @xcite .",
    "we folded the _ bepposax_mecs and pds data in different energy bands with this period , and the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : puls ] .",
    "we confirm the strong energy dependance of the 4u162667  pulse profile .",
    "the 210 kev pulse shape presents the characteristic _ bi - horned _ form , but the interpulse is not as flat as previously observed : it shows the presence of a small peak . as the energy increases , this third peak increases until it completely fills the interpulse , and the pulse profile becomes sinusoidal .",
    "this is a clear indication of the anisotropy in the radiative transfer in the strong neutron star magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we also computed the so - called _ modulation index _ , defined @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the maximum intensity in the pulse profile and @xmath61 is the minimum , at the given energy @xmath62 .",
    "this index gives information on the dependence on energy of the process which determines the modulation @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using the modulation index instead of the pulse fraction is that the former does not require the determination of the average emission .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mi ] , where we can see a monotonic increase of the index with energy ."
