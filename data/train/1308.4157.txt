    "the design and fabrication of micro- and nanotextured surfaces has received much attention during the past decade . in case of a hydrophobic texture",
    "a modified surface profile can lead to a very large contact angle , which induces exceptional wetting properties  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable mobility of liquids on such superhydrophobic surfaces is observed in the cassie state , where the textures are filled with gas , which renders them `` self - cleaning '' and causes droplets to roll ( rather than slide ) under gravity  @xcite and rebound ( rather than spread ) upon impact  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , patterned superhydrophobic materials are important in context of fluid dynamics and their superlubricating properties  @xcite .",
    "in particular , superhydrophobic heterogeneous surfaces in the cassie state exhibit very low friction , and this drag reduction is associated with the large slippage of liquids  @xcite .",
    "it is very difficult to quantify the flow past heterogeneous surfaces .",
    "however , analytical results can often be obtained using an effective slip boundary condition , @xmath0 , at the imaginary smooth homogeneous , but generally anisotropic surface  @xcite . for anisotropic textures ,",
    "the effective slip generally depends on the direction of the flow and is a tensor , @xmath1 represented by a symmetric , positive definite @xmath2 matrix  @xcite @xmath3diagonalized by a rotation @xmath4equation  ( [ beff_def1 ] ) allows us to calculate an effective slip in any direction given by an angle @xmath5 , provided the two eigenvalues of the slip - length tensor , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , are known .",
    "the concept of an effective slip length tensor is general and can be applied for arbitrary channel thickness  @xcite .",
    "it is a global characteristic of a channel  @xcite , and the eigenvalues usually depend not only on the parameters of the heterogeneous surfaces , but also on the channel thickness .",
    "however , for a thick channel ( compared to a texture period , @xmath10 ) they become a characteristic of a heterogeneous interface solely .    an important type of such surfaces are highly anisotropic textures , where a ( scalar ) partial local slip @xmath11 varies in only one direction .",
    "such surfaces can be created experimentally by making textured surfaces with one dimensional surface profiles , and in the cassie state , the local slip length will always reflect the relief of the texture .",
    "this is the consequence of the `` gas cushion model '' , which takes into account that the dissipation at the gas / liquid interface is dominated by the shearing of a continuous gas layer  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are dynamic viscosities of a gas and a liquid , and @xmath15 is the thickness of the gas layer .",

    "@xcite or if the flux in the `` pockets '' of superhydrophobic surfaces is equal to zero  @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ bgas ] ) could overestimate the local slip .",

    "( [ bgas ] ) leads to @xmath17 , it is expected that the `` gas cushion model '' could be safely applied up to @xmath18 or so .",
    "the flow properties on highly anisotropic surfaces can be highly peculiar .",
    "in particular , off - diagonal effects may be obtained where a driving force ( such as pressure gradient , shear rate , or electric field ) in one direction induces a flow in a different direction , with a measurable and useful perpendicular component.this could be exploited for implementing transverse pumps , mixers , flow detectors , and more  @xcite .",
    "the main task is to find the connection between the eigenvalues of the slip - length tensor and the parameters of such one - dimensional surface textures . up to now analytical results for the effective slip length",
    "have only been obtained for the simplest geometry of rectangular grooves @xcite .",
    "we are unaware of any prior work that has obtained analytical results for other types of one - dimensional textures .",
    "however , some recently derived relations for the case of an anisotropic isolated surface ( corresponding to the thick channel limit ) allow one to simplify the analysis of more complex geometries , and to rationalize the limiting behavior of the effective slip length in certain regimes .",
    "we mention first that the transverse component of the slip - length tensor was predicted to be exactly half the longitudinal component that one would obtain if the local slip were multiplied with a factor two , @xmath19  @xcite @xmath20 = \\frac{b_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\parallel } \\left [ 2b\\left ( y\\right ) /l\\right ] } { 2}.   \\label{1d}\\]]this relation can greatly simplify the analysis since it indicates that the flow along any direction of the one - dimensional surface can be easily determined , once the longitudinal component of the effective slip tensor is found .",
    "equation ( [ 1d ] ) has been recently verified for a texture with sinusoidal superhydrophobic grooves by using a lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method @xcite , and for weakly slipping stripes by using dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) simulations  @xcite .",
    "another useful relation addresses the particular case where the local slip is large , @xmath21 . in that case , the effective slip length tensor @xmath22 becomes isotropic and is given by @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mean inverse local slip .",
    "finally , for weakly slipping patterns with @xmath25 , the flow again becomes isotropic , and its value is equal to the surface average of the local slip length  @xcite : @xmath26 note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : b_small ] ) is expected to be accurate for a continuous local slip profile only . if the local slip length exhibits step - like jumps at the edges of heterogeneities , the expansions leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : b_small ] ) become questionable .",
    "higher order contributions to the effective slip become comparable to the first - order term given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : b_small ] ) and can no longer be ignored @xcite .",
    "computer simulations and numerical modeling can shed light on flow phenomena past one - dimensional surfaces . in efforts to better understand the connection between the parameters of the texture and the effective slip lengths , several groups have performed continuum and molecular dynamics simulations of flow past anisotropic surfaces .",
    "most of these studies focused on calculating eigenvalues of the effective slip - length tensor for superhydrophobic stripes  @xcite . to study various aspects of a flow past striped walls , recent works employed dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd )  @xcite and lattice boltzmann ( lb )  @xcite methods .",
    "in the case of stripes with a piecewise constant local slip profile ( i.e. , the profile features steplike jumps at the boundaries of the stripes ) , the singularity in the slip profile induces singularities both in the pressure and velocity gradient , which generates an additional mechanism for dissipation even at small local slip  @xcite .",
    "anisotropic one - dimensional texture with continuously varying patterns can produce a very large effective slip .",
    "this has been confirmed in recent lb simulations studies of sinusoidal textures  @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional continuous surfaces may also exhibit singularities ( for example , the first derivative may be discontinuous ) .",
    "however , we are unaware of any previous work that has addressed the question of effective slip lengths past such textures .",
    "in this paper we study the friction properties on trapezoidal superhydrophobic grooves [ see fig . [",
    "fig : sketch](a ) ] .",
    "this texture is more general than rectangular grooves since it provides an additional geometrical structure parameter , i.e. , the trapezoid base width .",
    "also , the trapezoid texture can be extended to its extremes , such as a triangular patterns , where the liquid / solid contact area vanishes , and rectangular reliefs .",
    "superhydrophobic trapezoidal textures were shown to give large contact angles , and to provide stable cassie states  @xcite .",
    "an obvious advantage of the trapezoidal surface relief is that the manufactured texture becomes mechanically more stable against bending compared to rectangular grooves .",
    "furthermore , it can be naturally formed from dilute rectangular grooves as a result of elasto - capillarity  @xcite .",

    ", of the corresponding local slip length ( b ) .",
    "]    our study is based on the use of dpd simulations , which we have put forward in our previous papers  @xcite , on the numerical solution of the stokes equations ( a collocation method ) , and on theoretical analysis .",
    "in particular , we validate eq .",
    "( [ 1d ] ) for trapezoidal textures with various parameters , we apply eq .",
    "( [ eq : b_large ] ) to evaluate an effective slip for strongly slipping patterns , we discuss the singularities in velocities caused by inflection points in the local slip profiles , which in particular lead to deviations from eq .",
    "( [ eq : b_small ] ) , and we finally suggest the optimal design of trapezoidal patterns .",
    "we consider creeping flow along a plane anisotropic superhydrophobic wall , using a cartesian coordinate system @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) . as in most previous publications  @xcite",
    ", we model the superhydrophobic plate as a flat heterogeneous interface .",
    "in such a description , we neglect an additional mechanism for a dissipation connected with the meniscus curvature  @xcite .",
    "note however that such an ideal situation has been achieved in many recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "the origin of coordinates is placed at the flat interface , characterized by a slip length @xmath11 , spatially varying in one direction , and the texture varies over a period @xmath10 .",
    "the local slip length is taken to be a piecewise linear function .",
    "it includes two regions with a constant slip : one where the slip length assumes its minimum value , @xmath28 , which has area fraction of @xmath29 , and another with area fraction @xmath30 where the slip length is maximal .",
    "these regions are connected by two transition regions with equal surface fractions @xmath31 , where the local slip length varies linearly from @xmath28 to @xmath32 .",
    "if we rewrite the coordinate @xmath33 in the form @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is an integer number and @xmath36 , the local slip - length profile can be expressed in terms of @xmath37 : @xmath38 for @xmath39 , we get a triangular profile @xmath40 note that regular trapezoidal and triangular profiles are continuous functions ( albeit with a discontinuous first derivative ) .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath41 , the profile reduces to the discontinuous rectangular slip length profile ( alternating stripe profile ) studied in earlier work @xmath42    our results apply to a single surface in a thick channel , where effective hydrodynamic slip is determined by flow at the scale of roughness , so that the velocity profile sufficiently far above the surface may be considered as a linear shear flow  @xcite .",
    "however it does not apply to a thin  @xcite or an arbitrary  @xcite channel situation , where the effective slip scales with the channel width .",
    "note that the flow in thin channels with superhydrophobic trapezoidal textures has been considered in recent work  @xcite .",
    "dimensionless variables are defined by using @xmath10 as a reference length scale , the inverse shear rate @xmath43 sufficiently far from the surface as a reference time scale , and setting the fluid kinematic viscosity , @xmath44 , to unity ( this sets the scale of mass ) . at small reynolds number ,",

    "more specifically , we use a version of dpd without conservative interactions @xcite and combine that with a tunable - slip method @xcite to model patterned surfaces .",
    "the tunable - slip method allows one to implement arbitrary hydrodynamic boundary condition in coarse - grained simulations . in the following ,",
    "we give a brief description of the model and introduce the implementation of planar surfaces with arbitrary one - dimensional slip profile .",
    "the basic dpd equations involve pair interactions between fluid particles .",

    "the amplitude of the stochastic contribution is related to the dissipative contribution by a fluctuation - dissipation theorem in order to ensure that the model reproduces the correct equilibrium distribution .",

    "the dissipative contribution is similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dpd_f_d ] ) , with the velocity replaced by the relative particle velocity with respect to the wall . for immobile walls ,",
    "the dissipative part can be written as @xmath90 the parameter @xmath91 characterizes the strength of the wall friction and can be used to tune the value of the slip length .",
    "for example , @xmath92 results in a perfectly slippery wall , whereas a positive value of @xmath91 leads to a finite slip length .",
    "the random force has the form @xmath93 where each component of @xmath94 is a random variable .",
    "again , the magnitude of the random force is chosen such that the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is satisfied .",

    "we need an accurate expression for the relation between the slip length and the tuning parameter @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , we have simulated plane poiseuille and couette flows with different @xmath91 to obtain the slip length and the position of the hydrodynamic boundary .",
    "the simulation results were fitted to a truncated laurent series up to second order in @xmath91 and first order in @xmath97 .",

    "one important observation is that both the slip length @xmath95 and the friction coefficient @xmath91 are local quantities .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to assume that the relation ( [ eq : b_fit ] ) also holds for inhomogeneous surfaces , as long as the slip length varies on length scales much larger than the range of the weight functions , @xmath99 and @xmath100 . for a patterned surface with @xmath10 much larger than @xmath88",

    "the simulation box is a rectangular cuboid of size @xmath105 , periodic boundary conditions are assumed in the @xmath86 plane , and the two symmetric patterned surfaces are located at @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the separation between the two surfaces is about twice the pattern periodicity .",
    "we have checked that increasing the channel thickness does not change the results .",
    "the simulation starts with randomly distributed particles inside the channel , and flow is induced by applying a body force to all particles .",
    "body forces used in this simulation were chosen small enough that the flow velocity near the wall was less than @xmath108 , in order to ensure that the flow is strictly laminar and effects of finite reynolds numbers do not affect the simulation results .",
    "the magnitude of the slip velocity also affects the spatial resolution in modeling the variation of the slip length .",
    "since the trajectories of the fluid particles are integrated at discrete time steps , the friction experienced by the particle between time steps is determined from the early instant .",
    "therefore , we used a small time step of @xmath109 . due to the large system size ,",
    "the relaxation time required for reaching a steady state was very large as well ( over @xmath110 time steps ) .",
    "the flow velocity is small in comparison with the thermal fluctuation ; thus many time steps are necessary to gather sufficient statistics . in this work",
    ", velocity profiles were averaged over @xmath111 time steps .",
    "a fit to the plane poiseuille flow then gives the effective slip length @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "the error bars are obtained by six independent runs with different initialization .",
    "finally , we note that in case of a triangular local slip , only a very small region near the no - slip point contributes to the shear stress at large @xmath113 .",
    "this presents a complication for simulations since fluid particles with a finite translational velocity travel a small distance over the no - slip region before reaching the zero averaged velocity .",
    "this distance is related to the initial velocity of the fluid particles when they enter the no - slip region , which is in general proportional to @xmath32 and the pressure gradient ( the body force in simulation ) . to obtain accurate simulation data at large @xmath114",
    ", one has to reduce the body force significantly , and the necessary simulation times increase prohibitively .",
    "therefore , only simulation results for @xmath115 and smaller are presented for this texture .",
    "here we present the results for the eigenvalues of the slip - length tensor obtained by simulations of different local slip profiles .",
    "we first verify eq .",
    "( [ 1d ] ) , derived earlier by some of us  @xcite to relate the longitudinal and transverse effective slip lengths .",
    "we use local slip profiles with @xmath116 . in that special case ,",
    "the profile @xmath11 can be characterized by three parameters : the area fraction @xmath29 of the no - slip region , the surface - averaged slip length @xmath117 , and the heterogeneity factor , @xmath118 , which is a measure for the relative variation of the slip length and defined as @xmath119 a homogeneous surface then corresponds to @xmath120 , and low values of @xmath118 corresponds to small @xmath121 .",
