    "how the electroweak symmetry is broken is one of the fundamental questions of particle physics . in the standard model ,",
    "the scalar higgs doublet acquires a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value ( _ vev _ ) , and therefore breaks the electroweak symmetry .",
    "however , the field - theoretical loop corrections to the masses of scalar particles are quadratically divergent .",
    "therefore , the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking is in fact unstable against radiative corrections , and how the very large hierarchy between the planck scale and the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking is generated remains a mystery .",
    "currently , weak scale supersymmetry @xcite is the most promising solution this hierarchy problem .",
    "supersymmetric theories are free from quadratic divergences due to delicate cancellations between boson and and fermion loop corrections , and therefore can stabilize the hierarchy between the planck scale and the electroweak scale .",
    "however , supersymmetry itself does not explain the origin of the electroweak scale .",
    "furthermore , supersymmetry introduces new particles ( _ i.e. _ , supersymmetric partners of the standard model particles . ) therefore , as a requirement of particle phenomenology , supersymmetry must be broken and the resulting theory is a supersymmetric extension of the standard model with supersymmetry _ softly _ broken at the electroweak scale .",
    "the experimental search for supersymmetric partners is very important to our understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "it will also shed light on the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking as well as the physics at ( and possibly above ) the scale where supersymmetry is broken . on the other hand , constructing a realistic scheme of supersymmetry breaking remains one of the big challenges to supersymmetry phenomenology .",
    "although it is possible , without knowing the details of the supersymmetry breaking mechanism , to parametrize the effects of softly broken supersymmetry in an effective description , yet it involves a huge numbers of unknown parameters and thus makes phenomenological analyses highly intractable .",
    "it is therefore desirable to have a realistic supersymmetry breaking scheme which predicts all the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters in terms of only a few parameters .",
    "it is well known that superstring theory offers , according to the above consideration , the most powerful scheme of supersymmetry phenomenology .",
    "more precisely , all the _ parameters _ appearing in the effective description of the superstring are in principle determined by the dynamics of superstring alone , _",
    "i.e. _ , by the _ vev _",
    "s of certain fields ( _ e.g. _ , the string dilaton and moduli . ) besides , the most compelling reason to study superstring theory is the fact that it is the only known candidate theory of quantum gravity .",
    "however , at the perturbative level the superstring has many vacua parametrized by flat directions ( _ e.g. _ , the string dilaton and moduli ) which will be lifted only after non - perturbative effects are included . even with the recent progress of string duality , there is still little knowledge of these non - perturbative effects and hence how the above powerful feature of superstring theory is realized .",
    "earlier attempts to study the phenomenology of superstrings @xcite have either ignored the non - perturbative effects responsible for stabilizing the string dilaton / moduli or relied on the racetrack model @xcite , and therefore their results may not be reliable . it is believed and will be shown in the following chapters that it is possible to draw reliable predictions from superstrings only after the relevant non - perturbative effects are fully taken into account .",
    "our study of superstring phenomenology contains two kinds of non - perturbative effects : the stringy non - perturbative effects generated above the string scale , and the field - theoretical non - perturbative effects of gaugino condensation generated by strongly - interacting gauge groups below the string scale . as for stringy non - perturbative effects",
    ", they have always been ignored in the past . the existence of significant stringy non - perturbative effects was first conjectured by s.h .",
    "shenker @xcite .",
    "the recent development of string duality has provided further evidence @xcite for shenker s conjecture .",
    "it was first noticed by t. banks and m. dine that significant stringy non - perturbative effects could have interesting implications @xcite . here",
    "we will study in detail the phenomenological implications of stringy non - perturbative effects using the linear multiplet formalism of superstring effective theory .",
    "it was first pointed out in @xcite that the field - theoretical limit of the weakly - coupled heterotic string theory should be described using the linear multiplet formalism rather than the chiral multiplet formalism . on the other hand",
    ", there exists a chiral - linear duality between these two formalisms @xcite , and therefore in principle these two formalisms should be equivalent .",
    "however , the chiral - linear duality is apt to be very complicated , especially when full quantum corrections are included .",
    "therefore , there should exist a formalism where the physics allows a simpler description .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that , according to the above consideration , the linear multiplet formalism should be the more appropriate formalism .",
    "furthermore , our study represents a concrete realization of this point of view .",
    "as we shall see in chapter 2 , in the linear multiplet formalism the string coupling is the linear multiplet @xmath4 which is the natural parametrization of stringy physics . on the other hand ,",
    "the coupling of string effective field theory is @xmath5 which is the natural parametrization of field - theoretical effects ; it is modified in the presence of stringy effects @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the linear multiplet formalism naturally distinguishes stringy effects from field - theoretical effects , and it is this feature that enables one to keep track of both effects within the effective field theory .",
    "this advantage of the linear multiplet formalism is very crucial to our study where both stringy and field - theoretical non - perturbative effects are considered .",
    "as we will see , stringy non - perturbative effects do play an important role in stabilizing the string dilaton / moduli and in breaking supersymmetry via the field - theoretical non - perturbative effects of gaugino condensation @xcite .    as for the field - theoretical non - perturbative effects ,",
    "gaugino condensation has always played a unique role : at low energy , the strong dilaton - yang - mills interaction leads to gaugino condensation which not only breaks supersymmetry spontaneously but also generates a non - perturbative potential which may eventually stabilize the dilaton . in the scheme of gaugino condensation the stabilization of string dilaton / moduli and the breaking of supersymmetry are therefore unified in the sense that they are two aspects of a single non - perturbative phenomenon .",
    "furthermore , gaugino condensation has its own important phenomenological motivations : gaugino condensation occurs in the hidden sector of a generic string model @xcite ; it can break supersymmetry at a sufficiently small scale and may induce viable soft supersymmetry breaking effects in the observable sector through gravity and/or an anomalous u(1 ) gauge interaction @xcite .",
    "however , although gaugino condensation has been studied since 1982 , it still has several long - standing problems in the context of superstrings .",
    "firstly , superstring phenomenology based on the scheme of gaugino condensation has been long plagued by the infamous dilaton runaway problem @xcite .",
    "that is , ( assuming that the tree - level khler potential of the dilaton is a good approximation ) one generally finds that the supersymmetric vacuum with vanishing coupling constant and no gaugino condensation is the only stable minimum in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "secondly , modular invariance is a very important property of the heterotic string , and it should have unique phenomenological predictions . however , most of the studies of gaugino condensation had neither complete nor correct treatments of modular invariance .",
    "as we shall see , a fully modular invariant treatment of gaugino condensation has non - trivial phenomenological implications .",
    "thirdly , in the past the gaugino condensate has always been described by an _ unconstrained _ chiral superfield @xmath7 which corresponds to the bound state of @xmath8 in the underlying theory .",
    "it was pointed out recently that @xmath7 should be a _ constrained _ chiral superfield @xcite due to the constrained superspace geometry of the underlying yang - mills theory : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an unconstrained vector superfield .",
    "fourthly , superstring phenomenology based on gaugino condensation suffers from several cosmological problems such as the cosmological moduli problem @xcite and the cosmological bound on the invisible axion @xcite . these cosmological problems either destroy the successful nucleosynthesis or overclose the universe .",
    "these formidable problems might make one think that the weakly - coupled heterotic string theory is in grave danger . on the other hand ,",
    "these problems are not unrelated to one another because the superstring has a highly constrained and predictive framework .",
    "as we shall see , in fact these problems arise from our poor understanding of non - perturbative string dynamics as well as inappropriate / incomplete treatments of superstring phenomenology in the past .",
    "once we know how to proceed in the right direction , these problems turn out to be solved or much less serious . for the first problem , we emphasize the advantage of using the linear multiplet formalism and show that stringy non - perturbative effects may stabilize the dilaton at a value compatible with a weak coupling regime @xcite .",
    "for the second and the third problems , full modular invariance is ensured through the green - schwarz term and string threshold corrections , and the constraint on the gaugino condensate @xmath7 is explicitly solved using the linear multiplet formalism @xcite .",
    "they do lead to unique predictions of superstring theory about supersymmetry breaking , the compactification scale , and axion physics .",
    "for example , string moduli are stabilized at the self - dual point , and therefore they do not participate in supersymmetry breaking because the _ vev _ s of moduli s @xmath0 terms vanish @xcite .",
    "this is certainly a desirable feature in consideration of flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) because non - vanishing _",
    "s of moduli s @xmath0 terms generically lead to non - universal contributions to the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters.@xmath11s@xmath12/z@xmath13 ) .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite recently , in that case supersymmetry is broken in the 5d bulk ; both the supergravity multiplet and the bulk moduli play the roles of messengers for carrying the effects of supersymmetry breaking to the observable sector at one of the two boundaries .",
    "therefore , the contribution to the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters from the bulk moduli is non - universal generally . ] in other words , simply as a consequence of modular invariance and an appropriate treatment of gaugino condensation , we have a dilaton - dominated scenario of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "therefore , the weakly - coupled heterotic string offers a rationale for the well - known dilaton - dominated scenario of supersymmetry breaking in a very elegant way . for the fourth problem ,",
    "let s recall the standard lore of superstring phenomenology which tells us that , based on a very naive order - of - magnitude estimate , string dilaton and moduli gain from supersymmetry breaking masses of order of the gravitino mass . since the gravitino mass is of order of the electroweak scale , these small masses of the dilaton and moduli lead to the cosmological moduli problem . on the other hand , our model is realistic enough for us to discuss these issues based on actual computations rather than educated guesses : it turns out that the string dilaton and moduli are in fact much heavier than the gravitino , which may be sufficient to solve the cosmological moduli problem @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the large entropy produced by the decays of the heavy moduli in our model will dilute the axion density and therefore raise the cosmological bound on the axion decay constant . as we shall see",
    ", this could solve the cosmological problem of the invisible axion .",
    "finally , let s make a brief comment on how the recent development of string duality might affect the status of weakly - coupled heterotic string theory .",
    "there have been claims in the literature in favor of the strongly - coupled heterotic string theory by arguing that it is unlikely that the weakly - coupled heterotic string theory can solve the dilaton runaway problem .",
    "however , the recent observation of string dualities actually implies that the strong coupling limit of heterotic string theory , which can be described by another weakly - coupled theory ( _ i.e. _ , m - theory compactified on r@xmath14@xmath11s@xmath12/z@xmath13 @xcite ) , is plagued by a similar runaway problem , along the 11th dimension .",
    "in particular , @xmath15 controls supersymmetry breaking , and supersymmetry is unbroken in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , there seem to be only two logical options for solving the runaway problem : either a truly non - perturbative heterotic string theory which does not allow a weakly - coupled description , or a weakly - coupled theory ( _ i.e. _ , the weakly - coupled heterotic string theory or the strong coupling limit of heterotic string theory ) .",
    "so far the first option remains a very interesting yet remote possibility . on the other hand , as for the second option both the weakly - coupled heterotic string theory and the strong coupling limit of heterotic string theory certainly deserve further study , is of order @xmath17 , where @xmath17 is the grand unification scale of the mssm .",
    "however , in our model the moduli associated with compactification are stabilized at the self - dual point , and therefore the argument of @xcite is not valid . more details of this discussion can be found in section 5.5 ] .",
    "it is first proposed by t. banks and m. dine @xcite that significant stringy non - perturbative effects could stabilize the dilaton .",
    "based on this idea , it is our purpose here to show that the weakly - coupled heterotic string theory could solve the dilaton runaway problem as well as lead to a satisfactory phenomenology @xcite .    in chapter 2 , a simple string orbifold model with a hidden e@xmath18 gauge group and no hidden matter",
    "is used to illustrate the studies of the linear multiplet formalism , the incorporation of stringy non - perturbative effects , static gaugino condensation , and the dilaton runaway problem . in chapter 3 , we give the motivations for studying dynamical gaugino condensation , and then show that static gaugino condensation is indeed the appropriate low - energy effective description of dynamical gaugino condensation . in chapter 4 , we extend our previous studies to a generic string orbifold model .",
    "the resulting model is generic and realistic enough , and we are therefore in a position to address several important phenomenological issues . in chapter 5 , we discuss phenomenological issues such as the dilaton and moduli masses , axion physics , soft supersymmetry breaking parameters , gauge coupling unification , as well as cosmological issues .",
    "constructing a realistic scheme of supersymmetry breaking is one of the big challenges to supersymmetry phenomenology .",
    "however , in the context of superstring phenomenology , there are actually more challenges .",
    "as is well known , a very powerful feature of superstring phenomenology is that all the _ parameters _ of the model are in principle dynamically determined by the _ vev _",
    "s of certain fields .",
    "one of these important fields is the string dilaton whose _ vev _ determines the gauge coupling constants . on the other hand ,",
    "how the dilaton is stabilized is outside the reach of perturbation theory since the dilaton s potential remains flat to all order in perturbation theory according to the non - renormalization theorem .",
    "therefore , understanding how the dilaton is stabilized ( _ i.e. _ , how the gauge coupling constants are determined ) is of no less significance than understanding how supersymmetry is broken .",
    "gaugino condensation has been playing a unique role in these issues : gaugino condensation not only breaks supersymmetry but also generates a non - perturbative dilaton potential which may eventually stabilize the dilaton .",
    "furthermore , gaugino condensation has its own important phenomenological motivations @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this beautiful scheme of gaugino condensation has been long plagued by the infamous dilaton runaway problem @xcite .",
    "( the recent observation of string dualities further implies that the strong - coupling regime is plagued by a similar runaway problem @xcite . ) only a few solutions to the dilaton runaway problem have been proposed . assuming the scenario of two or more gaugino condensates , the racetrack model stabilizes the dilaton and breaks supersymmetry with a more complicated dilaton superpotential generated by multiple gaugino condensation @xcite .",
    "however , stabilization of the dilaton in the racetrack model requires a delicate cancellation between the contributions from different gaugino condensates , which is not very natural .",
    "furthermore , it has a large and negative cosmological constant when supersymmetry is broken .",
    "the other solutions generically require the presence of an additional source of supersymmetry breaking ( _ e.g. _ , a constant term in the superpotential ) @xcite .",
    "it is therefore fair to say that there is no satisfactory solution so far .",
    "recently , there have been several new developments and insights in superstring phenomenology .",
    "it is our purpose to show that these new ingredients play important roles in the above issues and can eventually lead to a promising solution .",
    "one of these new ingredients is the linear multiplet formalism of superstring effective theories @xcite : among the massless string modes , a real scalar ( dilaton ) , an antisymmetric tensor field ( the kalb - ramond field ) and their supersymmetric partners can be described either by a chiral superfield @xmath19 or by a linear multiplet @xmath20 , which is known as the chiral - linear duality @xcite . by definition ,",
    "the linear multiplet @xmath20 is a vector superfield that satisfies the following constraints @xcite : @xmath21 the lowest component of @xmath20 is the dilaton field @xmath22 , and its _ vev _ is related to the gauge coupling constant as follows will be modified in the presence of stringy non - perturbative effects @xcite . ] : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the string scale @xcite .",
    "although the chiral - linear duality is obvious at tree level , it becomes obscure when quantum effects are included .",
    "although scalar-2-form field strength duality , which is contained in chiral - linear duality , has been shown to be preserved in perturbation theory  @xcite , the situation is less clear in the presence of non - perturbative effects , which are important in the study of gaugino condensation .",
    "it has recently been shown  @xcite that gaugino condensation can be formulated directly using a linear multiplet for the dilaton .",
    "although a formal equivalence between the chiral and linear multiplet formalisms has been shown  @xcite , the content of the resulting chiral - linear duality transformation is in general very complicated .",
    "if there is an elegant description of gaugino condensates in the context of superstring effective theories , it may be simple in only one of these formalisms , but not in both .",
    "therefore , a pertinent issue is : which formalism is better ? here we will construct the effective theory of gaugino condensation directly in the linear multiplet formalism without referring to the chiral multiplet formalism .",
    "there is reason to believe that the linear multiplet formalism is in fact more appropriate .",
    "the stringy reason for choosing the linear multiplet formalism is that the precise field content of the linear multiplet appears in the massless string spectrum , and @xmath25 plays the role of string loop expansion parameter .",
    "therefore , string information is more naturally encoded in the linear multiplet formalism of string effective theory . furthermore , as we will see in chapter 2 , stringy effects are believed to be important in the stabilization of the dilaton and supersymmetry breaking by gaugino condensation ; therefore , it is more appropriate to study these issues in the linear multiplet formalism .",
    "the other new ingredient concerns the effective description of gaugino condensation . in the known models of gaugino condensation using the chiral superfield representation for the dilaton",
    ", the gaugino condensate has always been described by an _ unconstrained _ chiral superfield @xmath7 which corresponds to the bound state of @xmath8 in the underlying theory .",
    "it was pointed out recently that @xmath7 should be a _ constrained _ chiral superfield @xcite due to the constrained superspace geometry of the underlying yang - mills theory : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an unconstrained vector superfield .",
    "furthermore , in the linear multiplet formalism the linear multiplet @xmath20 and the constrained @xmath7 , @xmath26 nicely merge into an unconstrained vector superfield @xmath10 @xcite , and therefore the effective lagrangian can elegantly be described by @xmath10 alone .",
    "the third new ingredient is the stringy non - perturbative effect conjectured by @xcite .",
    "it is further argued in @xcite that the khler potential can in principle receive significant stringy non - perturbative corrections although the superpotential can not generically .",
    "significant stringy non - perturbative corrections to the khler potential imply that the usual dilaton runaway picture is valid only in the weak - coupling regime ; as pointed out in @xcite , these corrections may naturally stabilize the dilaton .    in the next section",
    "we describe the linear multiplet formalism of string effective yang - mills theory , whose effective theory below the condensation scale is constructed and analyzed in section 2.3 .",
    "it is then shown in section 2.4 that supersymmetry is broken and the dilaton is stabilized in a large class of models of static gaugino condensation . here",
    "we use the khler superspace formulation  @xcite of supergravity , suitably extended to incorporate the linear multiplet  @xcite .        in the realm of superstring effective yang - mills theory , there are two important ingredients , namely , the symmetry group of modular transformations and the linear multiplet . in order to make the discussion as explicit as possible in this chapter , we consider here orbifolds with gauge group @xmath27 , which have been studied most extensively in the context of modular symmetries @xcite .",
    "they contain three untwisted ( 1,1 ) moduli @xmath28 , @xmath29 , which transform under sl(2,z ) as follows : @xmath30 the corresponding khler potential is @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and the modular weights @xmath33 depend on the particular matter field @xmath34 as well as on the modulus @xmath28 .",
    "however , it is well known that the effective theory obtained from the massless truncation of superstring is _ not _ invariant under the modular transformations ( 2.3 ) at one loop @xcite .",
    "counterterms , that correspond to the result of integrating out massive modes , have to be added to the effective theory in order to restore modular invariance since string theory is known to be modular invariant to all orders of the loop expansion @xcite .",
    "two types of such counterterms have been discussed in the literature @xcite , the so - called @xmath35-type counterterms ( _ i.e. _ , string threshold corrections ) and the green - schwarz counterterm .",
    "the green - schwarz counterterm , which is analogous to the green - schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism in d=10 , is naturally implemented with the linear multiplet formalism  @xcite . in chapters 2 and 3",
    "we consider only those orbifolds in which the full modular anomaly is cancelled by the green - schwarz counterterm alone ( _ i.e. _ , orbifolds with universal modular anomaly cancellation ) , and more generic orbifolds with both types of counterterms present will be considered in chapter 4 . indeed",
    ", an orbifold has universal modular anomaly cancellation unless its modulus @xmath28 corresponds to an internal plane which is left invariant under some orbifold group transformations , which may happen only if an @xmath36=2 supersymmetric twisted sector is present  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a large class of orbifolds , including the @xmath37 and @xmath38 orbifolds , is under consideration in this chapter .",
    "the antisymmetric tensor field of superstring theories undergoes yang - mills gauge transformations . in the effective theory",
    ", it can be incorporated into a gauge invariant vector superfield @xmath20 , the so - called modified linear multiplet , coupled to the yang - mills degrees of freedom as follows : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the yang - mills chern - simons superform .",
    "the summation extends over the indices @xmath41 numbering simple subgroups of the full gauge group .",
    "the modified linear multiplet @xmath20 contains the linear multiplet as well as the chern - simons superform , and its gauge invariance is ensured by imposing appropriate transformation properties for the linear multiplet .",
    "the generic lagrangian describing the linear multiplet coupled to supergravity and matter in the presence of yang - mills chern - simons superform is @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath20 is the modified linear multiplet and @xmath43 is the casimir operator in the adjoint representation of @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 is the @xmath44 one - loop @xmath46-function coefficient .",
    "the first term of @xmath47 is the superspace integral which yields the kinetic actions for the linear multiplet , supergravity , matter and yang - mills fields .",
    "the second term in ( 2.6 ) is the green - schwarz counterterm , which is `` minimal '' in the sense of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , arbitrariness in the two functions @xmath48 and @xmath6 is reduced by the requirement that the einstein term in @xmath47 be canonical . under this constraint ,",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath6 are related to each other by the following first - order differential equation  @xcite : @xmath49 the complete component lagrangian of ( 2.6 ) with the tree - level khler potential ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) has been presented in @xcite based on the khler superspace formulation .",
    "similar studies have also been performed in the superconformal formulation of supergravity @xcite . in the following , we are interested in the effective lagrangian of ( 2.6 ) below the condensation scale .      in this section",
    "we would like to illustrate how stringy effects are naturally incorporated with the superstring effective field theory using the linear multiplet formalism .",
    "consider again the effective field theory defined at the string scale @xmath24 .",
    "the quantum corrections , @xmath48 and @xmath6 , to the tree - level khler potential of ( 2.6 ) are naturally interpreted as stringy effects . indeed , in the context of superstring @xmath20 plays the role of string loop expansion parameter ( _ i.e. _ , the string coupling ) , and therefore stringy effects are naturally parametrized by @xmath20 .",
    "although perturbative contributions to @xmath48 and @xmath6 are generically small , yet , as first pointed out by shenker @xcite , there can be significant stringy non - perturbative contributions .",
    "it is then interesting to ask how the usual relation between the dilaton @xmath22 and the gauge coupling constant of the effective field theory , @xmath23 , might get modified in the presence of stringy effects ?",
    "it is straightforward to compute the gauge coupling constant at the string scale , @xmath52 , defined by the effective field theory ( 2.6 ) as follows : @xmath53 indeed , the presence of stringy effects do affect the usual interpretation of the gauge coupling constant of the effective field theory in terms of the string dilaton .",
    "more precisely , the linear multiplet formalism naturally distinguishes stringy effects from field - theoretical effects ; that is , @xmath22 is the natural parametrization of stringy effects and @xmath54 is on the other hand the natural parametrization of field - theoretical effects .",
    "therefore , in the linear multiplet formalism of superstring effective field theory it is much easier to keep track of both stringy and field - theoretical effects . as mentioned before , this unique feature of linear multiplet formalism is crucial to our study here , since stringy non - perturbative effects do play an important role in the stringy story of gaugino condensation .    on the other hand , in the chiral multiplet formalism where the string dilaton is described by a chiral superfield @xmath19 chiral superfield ( @xmath55 )",
    ", @xmath19 has to be re - defined order by order in perturbation , which is clear from the perturbative chiral - linear duality .",
    "furthermore , in the chiral multiplet formalism there is no clear distinction between stringy effects and field - theoretical effects ; more precisely , we always have from the chiral multiplet formalism of the superstring effective field theory @xmath56 even when stringy effects are included .",
    "one may also derive this result by a duality transformation from the linear multiplet formalism ( 2.6 ) to the corresponding chiral multiplet formalism of ( 2.6 ) .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that @xmath57 corresponds to @xmath58 through this duality transformation , and therefore the interpretations of @xmath59 in both formalisms are consistent with each other . in conclusion , we emphasize the advantage of using the linear multiplet formalism over the chiral multiplet formalism in telling the stringy story of gaugino condensation .",
    "more evidence of this advantage will be discovered in the following sections .      below the condensation scale",
    "at which the gauge interaction becomes strong , the effective lagrangian of the yang - mills sector can be described by a composite chiral superfield @xmath7 , which corresponds to the chiral superfield @xmath60 of the underlying theory .",
    "( we consider here gaugino condensation of a simple gauge group . )",
    "the scalar component of @xmath7 is naturally interpreted as the gaugino condensate .",
    "it was pointed out only recently that the composite field @xmath7 is actually a constrained chiral superfield @xcite .",
    "the constraint on @xmath7 can be seen most clearly through the constrained superspace geometry of the underlying yang - mills theory . as a consequence of this constrained geometry , the chiral superfield @xmath60 and its hermitian conjugate @xmath61 satisfy the following constraint : @xmath62 ( 2.10 ) has a natural interpretation in the context of a 3-form supermultiplet , and indeed @xmath60 can be interpreted as the degrees of freedom of the 3-form field strength @xcite .",
    "the explicit solution to the constraint ( 2.10 ) has been presented in @xcite , and it allows us to identify the constrained chiral superfield @xmath60 with the chiral projection of an unconstrained vector superfield @xmath20 : @xmath63 below the condensation scale , the constraint ( 2.10 ) is replaced by the following constraint on @xmath7 and @xmath26 : @xmath64 similarly , the solution to ( 2.12 ) allows us to identify the constrained chiral superfield @xmath7 with the chiral projection of an unconstrained vector superfield @xmath10 : @xmath65 ( 2.13 ) is the explicit constraint on @xmath7 and @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , the constraint on @xmath7 and @xmath26 enters the linear multiplet formalism of gaugino condensation very naturally .",
    "as described in section 2.2.1 , the linear multiplet formalism of supersymmetric yang - mills theory is described by a gauge - invariant vector superfield @xmath20 which satisfies @xmath66 for the linear multiplet formalism of the superstring effective lagrangian below the condensation scale , ( 2.14 ) is replaced by @xmath67 where @xmath7 is the gaugino condensate chiral superfield , and @xmath10 contains the linear multiplet as well as the `` fossil '' chern - simons superform . in view of ( 2.15 ) , it is clear that the constraint on @xmath7 and @xmath26 arises naturally in the linear multiplet formalism of gaugino condensation .",
    "furthermore , the low - energy degrees of freedom ( _ i.e. _ , the linear multiplet and the gaugino condensate ) are nicely merged into a single vector superfield @xmath10 , and therefore the linear multiplet formalism of gaugino condensation can elegantly be described by @xmath10 alone in the context of superstring .",
    "the detailed construction of the effective lagrangian for the vector superfield @xmath10 will be presented in the next section .",
    "constructing the linear multiplet formalism of gaugino condensation requires the specification of two functions of the vector superfield @xmath10 , namely , the superpotential and the khler potential . in the linear multiplet formalism , there is no classical superpotential  @xcite , and the quantum superpotential originates from the non - perturbative effects of gaugino condensation .",
    "this non - perturbative superpotential , whose form was dictated by the anomaly structure of the underlying theory , was first obtained by veneziano and yankielowicz @xcite .",
    "the details of its generalization to the case of matter coupled to @xmath36=1 supergravity in the khler superspace formulation has been presented in @xcite , and the superpotential term in the lagrangian reads : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the constrained gaugino condensate chiral superfield with khler weight 2 , and @xmath70 is a constant with dimension of mass that is left undetermined by the method of anomaly matching .    as for the khler potential for @xmath10 ,",
    "there is little knowledge beyond tree level .",
    "the best we can do at present is to treat all physically reasonable khler potentials on the same footing and to look for possible general features and/or interesting special cases . in particular , we are interested in a specific class of khler potentials where there are significant stringy non - perturbative corrections as pointed out in @xcite . before discussing this general analysis , it is instructive to examine a simple yet un - realistic linear multiplet model for gaugino condensation defined as follows @xcite : @xmath71 this simple model describes the effective theory for ( 2.6 ) below the condensation scale , where the khler potential of @xmath10 assumes its tree - level form .",
    "it is a `` static '' model of gaugino condensation in the sense that no kinetic term for @xmath7 is included . from the viewpoint of the anomaly structure ,",
    "static as well as dynamical models of gaugino condensation are interesting in their own right . however , as will be discussed in chapter 3 , dynamical models rather than static models generically occur in the context of superstrings .",
    "dynamical models of gaugino condensation in the linear multiplet formalism @xcite have been studied less extensively . on the other hand , as will also be shown in chapter 3 , after integrating out the heavy modes the static model of gaugino condensation is proven to be the appropriate effective description for the dynamical model incorporated consistently . ] .",
    "therefore , in chapter 2 we will concentrate on static models of gaugino condensation , and there will be no loss of generality .    with @xmath69 and @xmath72 ,",
    "we can rewrite the superpotential terms of @xmath73 as a single @xmath74 term by superspace partial integration . for example , for any chiral superfield @xmath75 of zero khler weight : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is an element of the supervielbein , and the total derivative on the right hand side contains the chiral anomaly ( @xmath78 ) of the @xmath0 term on the left hand side . therefore , up to a total derivative , the simple model ( 2.17 ) can be rewritten as follows : @xmath79 in ( 2.19 ) , the modular anomaly cancellation by the green - schwarz counterterm is transparent  @xcite .",
    "the green - schwarz counterterm @xmath80 and the superpotential @xmath74 term @xmath81 are _ not _ modular invariant separately , but their sum is modular invariant , which ensures the modular invariance of the full theory .",
    "in fact , the green - schwarz counterterm cancels the @xmath28 moduli - dependence of the superpotential completely .",
    "this is a unique feature of the linear multiplet formalism , and , as we will see later , has interesting implications for the moduli - dependence of physical quantities .    throughout this paper",
    "only the bosonic and gravitino parts of the component lagrangian are presented , since we are interested in the vacuum configuration and the gravitino mass . in the following , we enumerate the definitions of bosonic component fields of the vector superfield @xmath10 .",

    "2.1 , the scalar potential starts with @xmath94 at @xmath93 , first rises and then falls without limit as @xmath22 increases .    therefore , @xmath95 is unbounded from below , and this simple model has no well - defined vacuum",
    ". this may be somewhat surprising because the model defined by ( 2.17 ) superficially appears to be of the no - scale type : the green - schwarz counterterm , that destroys the no - scale property of chiral models and destabilizes the potential , is cancelled here by quantum effects that induce a potential for the condensate .",
    "however the resulting quantum contribution to the lagrangian ( 2.19 ) , @xmath96 , has an implicit @xmath97-dependence through the superfield @xmath7 due to its nonvanishing khler weight : @xmath98 .",
    "this implicit moduli - dependence is a consequence of the anomaly matching condition , and parallels the construction of the effective theory in the chiral multiplet formalism  @xcite which is also not of the no - scale form once the green - schwarz counterterm is included .",
    "if we take a closer look at ( 2.25 ) , it is clear that the unboundedness of @xmath95 in the strong - coupling limit @xmath99 is caused by a term of two - loop order : @xmath100 .",
    "this observation strongly suggests that the underlying reason for unboundedness is our poor control over the model in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "the form of the superpotential @xmath101 is completely fixed by the underlying anomaly structure .",
    "however the khler potential is much less constrained , and the choice ( 2.17 ) can not be expected to be valid in the strong - coupling regime where the non - perturbative contributions should not be ignored .",
    "we conclude that the unboundedness shown in fig .",
    "2.1 simply reflects the importance of non - perturbative contributions to the khler potential .",
    "in particular , it is natural to expect that the stringy non - perturbative effects conjectured by shenker @xcite are the non - perturbative contributions to the khler potential ignored in this simple model . in the absence of a better knowledge of the exact khler potential",

    "we show how to construct the component lagrangian for generic linear multiplet models of static gaugino condensation in the khler superspace formulation .",
    "further computational details can be found in @xcite .",
    "although our results can probably be rephrased in the chiral multiplet formalism , the equivalent chiral multiplet formalism are expected to be rather complicated because of the constraint on the gaugino condensate chiral superfield @xmath7 .",
    "quite generally we do not expect a simple ansatz in one formalism to appear simple in the other .    as suggested in section 2.3.1 ,",
    "we extend the simple model in ( 2.17 ) to linear multiplet models of static gaugino condensation with generic khler potentials defined as follows : @xmath102 for convenience , we also write @xmath103 @xmath104 and @xmath105 represent quantum corrections to the tree - level khler potential . here",
    "we have chosen to keep the khler potential under discussion as generic as possible . however , as suggested by @xcite , stringy non - perturbative corrections to the khler potential are probably the most important non - perturbative corrections . and ,",

    ", we use the chiral density multiplet method  @xcite , which provides us with the locally supersymmetric generalization of the @xmath0 term construction in global supersymmetry .",
    "the chiral density multiplet @xmath109 and its hermitian conjugate @xmath110 for the generic model in ( 2.26 ) are : @xmath111 in order to obtain the component lagrangian @xmath73 , we need to work out the following expression @xmath112 an important point in the computation of ( 2.30 ) is the evaluation of the component field content of the khler supercovariant derivatives , a rather tricky process .",
    "the details of this computation have by now become general wisdom and we can to a large extent rely on the existing literature @xcite .",
    "in particular , the lorentz transformation and the khler transformation are incorporated in a very similar way in the khler superspace formulation , and the lorentz connection as well as the so - called khler connection @xmath113 are incorporated into the khler supercovariant derivatives in a concise and constructive way .",

    "this corresponds to the fact that there are two ways to perform duality transformation . if we take @xmath155 to be auxiliary , its equation of motion is @xmath157 which ensures that @xmath158 is dual to the field strength of an antisymmetric tensor @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath159 in the lagrangian @xmath73 thus generates a kinetic term of this antisymmetric tensor field and its coupling to the gravitino . the other way to perform",

    "the physics of @xmath73 will be investigated in the following sections .",
    "hidden - sector gaugino condensation has been a very attractive scheme @xcite for supersymmetry breaking in the context of superstring . however ,",
    "before we can make any progress in superstring phenomenology , two important questions must be answered : is the dilaton stabilized , and is supersymmetry broken ?",
    "past analyses have generally found that , in the absence of a second source of supersymmetry breaking , the dilaton is destabilized in the direction of vanishing gauge coupling constant ( the so - called runaway dilaton problem ) and supersymmetry is unbroken . to address the above questions in generic linear multiplet models of gaugino condensation ,",
    "we first show how the three issues of supersymmetry breaking , gaugino condensation and dilaton stabilization are reformulated , and how they are interrelated , by examining the explicit expressions for the gravitino mass and the gaugino condensate .",
    "a detailed investigation of the vacuum will be presented in section 2.4 .",
    "the explicit expression for the gaugino condensate in terms of the dilaton @xmath22 is determined by ( 2.49 ) : @xmath163 with @xmath164=0 and @xmath165=0 , we recover the result of the simple model ( 2.17 ) @xcite . for generic models ,",
    "the dilaton dependence of the gaugino condensate involves @xmath164 and @xmath165 which represent stringy non - perturbative corrections to the tree - level khler potential . recall that in the linear multiplet formalism the gauge coupling of the superstring effective field theory is @xmath166 .",

    "the expression for @xmath175 follows directly from @xmath141 .",
    "@xmath176 where we have used ( 2.49 ) .",
    "this expression for the gravitino mass is simple and elegant even for generic linear multiplet models of static gaugino condensation . from the viewpoint of superstring effective theories , an interesting feature of ( 2.54 )",
    "is that the gravitino mass @xmath175 contains no explicit dependence on the modulus @xmath28 , which provides a direct relation between @xmath175 and @xmath170 .",
    "this feature can be traced to the fact that the green - schwarz counterterm cancels the @xmath28 dependence of the superpotential completely , a unique feature of the linear multiplet formalism . as we will see in section 4.5 ,",
    "this unique feature is still true even in a generic string orbifold model .",
    "we recall that in the chiral multiplet formalism of gaugino condensation  without the condition ( 2.12 )  that have been studied previously ( with or without the green - schwarz cancellation mechanism ) , @xmath175 always involves a moduli - dependence , and therefore the relation between supersymmetry breaking ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath177 ) and gaugino condensation ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath172 ) remains undetermined until the true vacuum can be found .",
    "by contrast , in generic linear multiplet models of gaugino condensation , there is a simple and direct relation , eq.(2.54 ) : supersymmetry is broken ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath177 ) if and only if gaugino condensation occurs ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "we wish to emphasize that the above features of the linear multiplet model are unique in the sense that they are simple only in the linear multiplet model .",
    "this is related to the fact pointed out in sections 2.1 and 2.2.3 that , once the constraint ( 2.12 ) on the condensate field @xmath7 is imposed , the chiral counterpart of the linear multiplet model is in general very complicated , and it is more natural to work in the linear multiplet formalism .",
    "our conclusion of this section is best illustrated by the following diagram :    @xmath178 @xmath178    the equivalence among the above three issues is obvious .",
    "therefore , in the following section , we only need to focus on one of the three issues in the investigation of the vacuum , for example , the issue of dilaton stabilization .",
    "as argued in section 2.3.1 , non - perturbative contributions to the khler potential should be introduced to cure the unboundedness problem of the simple model ( 2.17 ) . in the context of the generic model of static gaugino condensation ( 2.26 ) , it is therefore interesting to address the question as to how the simple model ( 2.17 ) should be modified in order to obtain a viable theory ( _ i.e. _ , with @xmath95 bounded from below ) .",
    "we start with the scalar potential @xmath95 arising from ( 2.46 ) after solving for the auxiliary fields ( using ( 2.49 ) , ( 2.50 ) and ( 2.52 ) ) . recalling that ( 2.27 ) yields the identity @xmath179",
    ", we obtain @xmath180 which depends only on the dilaton @xmath22 . the necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath95 to be bounded from below",
    "is @xmath181 it is clear that condition ( 2.56 ) is not at all restrictive , and therefore has no nontrivial implication . on the contrary ,",
    "condition ( 2.57 ) is quite restrictive ; in particular the simple model ( 2.17 ) violates this condition .",
    "condition ( 2.57 ) not only restricts the possible forms of the function @xmath35 in the strong - coupling regime but also has important implications for dilaton stabilization and for supersymmetry breaking . to make the above statement more precise ,",
    "let us revisit the unbounded potential of fig .",
    "2.1 , with the tree - level khler potential defined by @xmath182 . adding physically reasonable",
    "corrections @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( constrained by ( 2.5657 ) ) to this simple model should not qualitatively alter its behavior in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "therefore , as in fig .",
    "2.1 , the potential of the modified model in the weak - coupling regime starts with @xmath94 at @xmath93 , first rises and then falls as @xmath22 increases . on the other hand , adding @xmath104 and @xmath105 completely alters the strong - coupling behavior of the original simple model . as guaranteed by condition",
    "( 2.57 ) , the potential of the modified model in the strong - coupling regime is always bounded from below , and in most cases rises as @xmath22 increases . joining the weak - coupling behavior of the modified model to its strong - coupling behavior",
    "therefore strongly suggests that its potential has a non - trivial minimum ( at @xmath183 ) .",
    "furthermore , if this non - trivial minimum is global , then the dilaton is stabilized .",
    "we conclude that not only does ( 2.5657 ) tell us how to modify the theory , but a large class of theories so modified have naturally a stabilized dilaton ( and therefore broken supersymmetry by the argument of section 2.3.3 ) . in view of the fact that there is currently little knowledge of the exact khler potential ,",
    "the above conclusion , which applies to generic khler potentials subject to ( 2.5657 ) , is especially important to the search for supersymmetry breaking and dilaton stabilization .",
    "as discussed in sections 2.1 and 2.2.2 , the most interesting physical implication of this conclusion is that it is actually stringy non - perturbative effects that stabilize the dilaton and allow dynamical supersymmetry breaking via the field - theoretical non - perturbative effect of gaugino condensation .",
    "furthermore , ( 2.57 ) can be interpreted as the necessary condition for stringy non - perturbative effects to stabilize the dilaton .",
    "here we use a simple example only to illustrate the above important argument .",
    "a more detailed discussion of possible stringy non - perturbative corrections will be given in chapters 4 and 5 where a generic and phenomenologically viable model is presented .",
    "consider @xmath184 , where @xmath185 and @xmath186 are constants to be determined by the non - perturbative dynamics .",
    "the regulation conditions ( 2.5657 ) require @xmath187 . in fig .",
    "2.2 , @xmath95 is plotted versus the dilaton @xmath22 , where @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath70=1 .",
    "2.2 has two important features .",
    "firstly , @xmath95 of this modified theory is indeed bounded from below , and the dilaton is stabilized .",
    "therefore , we obtain supersymmetry breaking , gaugino condensation and dilaton stabilization in this example .",
    "the gravitino mass is @xmath190 in reduced planck units .",
    "secondly , the _ vev _ of dilaton is stabilized at the phenomenologically interesting range ( @xmath191 in fig .",
    "the above features involve no unnaturalness since they are insensitive to @xmath185 .",
    "furthermore , the dilaton is naturally stabilized in a weak coupling regime if @xmath186 is of order one .",
    "2.2 is a nice realization of the argument in the preceding paragraph .",
    "it should be contrasted with the racetrack model where at least three gaugino condensates and large numerical coefficients are needed in order to achieve similar results .",
    "besides , the racetrack model has a serious phenomenological problem of having a large negative cosmological constant",
    ". we can also consider possible stringy non - perturbative contributions to the khler potential suggested in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that we obtain the same general features as those of fig .",
    "this is not surprising since , as argued in the preceding paragraph , the important features that we find in fig .",
    "2.2 are common to a large class of models .",
    "more such discussions will be presented in chapters 4 and 5 in conjunction with other issues .",
    "note that the value of the cosmological constant is irrelevant to the arguments presented here and in section 2.3.3 .",
    "in other words , the generic model ( 2.26 ) suffers from the usual cosmological constant problem , although we can find a fine - tuned subset of models whose cosmological constants vanish .",
    "for example , the cosmological constant of fig .",
    "2.2 vanishes by fine tuning @xmath185 .",
    "it remains an open question as to whether or not the cosmological constant problem could be resolved within the context of the linear multiplet formalism of gaugino condensation if the exact khler potential were known .",
    "we have presented a concrete example of a solution to the infamous runaway dilaton problem , within the context of local supersymmetry and the linear multiplet formalism for the string dilaton .",
    "we considered models for a static condensate that reflect the modular anomaly of the effective field theory while respecting the exact modular invariance of the underlying string theory .",
    "the simplest such model  @xcite has a nontrivial potential that is , however , unbounded in the direction of strong coupling .",
    "including stringy non - perturbative corrections @xcite to the khler potential for the dilaton , the potential is stabilized , allowing a vacuum configuration in which condensation occurs and supersymmetry is broken .",
    "this is in contrast to previous analyses , based on the chiral multiplet formalism for the dilaton , in which supersymmetry breaking with a bounded vacuum energy was achieved only by introducing an additional source of supersymmetry breaking , such as a constant term in the superpotential @xcite .    in further contrast to most of the models studied using the chiral multiplet formalism",
    ", supersymmetry breaking arises from a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the auxiliary field associated with the dilaton rather than the moduli : roughly speaking , in the dual chiral multiplet formalism , @xmath192 rather than @xmath193 .",
    "that is , only the dilaton participates in supersymmetry breaking ( the so - called dilaton - dominated scenario . )",
    "as we shall see in chapter 4 , this unique feature is in fact true in generic string orbifold models , which therefore has non - trivial implications for fcnc . as a consequence , gaugino masses and @xmath185 terms",
    "are generated at tree level .",
    "although scalar masses are still protected at tree level by a heisenberg symmetry  @xcite , they will be generated at one loop by renormalizable interactions .",
    "for the model considered here , the hierarchy ( about five orders of magnitude ) between the planck scale and the gravitino mass is insufficient to account for the observed scale of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "of course , this is completely due to the large gauge content of the hidden e@xmath18 gauge group under consideration in this chapter , and will certainly be improved when a generic string model with a product of smaller hidden gauge groups @xmath194 . in that case",
    ", we will have to generalize the studies of this chapter by considering multiple gaugino condensation as well as hidden matter condensation .",
    "another unsatisfactory feature of the model presented in chapter 2 is that , according to ( 2.55 ) , the moduli @xmath28 remain flat directions of the scalar potential , and therefore the _ vev _ of @xmath195 is undetermined .",
    "fortunately , this is a feature belonging only to string models with hidden e@xmath18 gauge group and no hidden matter . as we shall see in chapter 4 , in a generic string model where multiple gaugino condensation as well as hidden matter condensation occurs naturally , hidden matter condensation together with string threshold corrections generates a non - perturbative potential for the moduli @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , the moduli are therefore stabilized at the self - dual point .",
    "the generalization of our formalism to generic string orbifold models , including models without universal anomaly cancellation , will be presented in chapter 4 .    as mentioned before , we have only dealt with generic models of static gaugino condensation in this chapter , but in the context of supergravity or superstrings it can be shown that models of dynamical gaugino condensation rather than models of static gaugino condensation occur .",
    "therefore , in the next chapter we will answer two questions : first , we show how to construct generic models of dynamical gaugino condensation using the linear multiplet formalism .",
    "secondly , we study how the models of dynamical gaugino condensation are connected to the models of static gaugino condensation , and show that static gaugino condensation is indeed the appropriate effective description of dynamical gaugino condensation and therefore justify the use of static gaugino condensation in chapter 2 .",
    "notice that the kalb - ramond field ( or the model - independent axion , in the dual description ) remains massless in the static models considered here .",
    "it has recently been shown in the context of global supersymmetry @xcite that an axion mass term is naturally generated in models of dynamical gaugino condensation . again , as we shall see in chapter 3 , one of the axions does get a very large mass through dynamical gaugino condensation in the context of local supersymmetry . on the other hand , after this very heavy axion is integrated out , the resulting axion content is in fact the same as that of static gaugino condensation , and we are still left with a massless model - independent axion .",
    "furthermore , we will show in chapters 4 and 5 that this model - independent axion axion will pick up a very small mass through multiple gaugino condensation .",
    "it can escape the cosmological bound on the axion decay constant and it has the desirable properties to be the candidate for the qcd axion .",
    "in chapter 2 , we have studied models of static gaugino condensation using the linear multiplet formalism . as mentioned before ,",
    "one of the major motivations for studying models of dynamical gaugino condensation is the observation that kinetic terms of the gaugino condensate naturally arise from field - theoretical loop corrections @xcite as well as from classical string corrections @xcite .",
    "for example , the relevant field - theoretical one - loop correction has been computed using the chiral multiplet formalism @xcite : @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the effective cut - off and @xmath198 is the number of gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , the confined theory using the linear multiplet formalism should contain a term which corresponds to ( 3.1 ) : @xmath199 as well as higher - order corrections @xmath200 , @xmath201 these @xmath74 terms are corrections to the khler potential , and will generate the kinetic terms for the gaugino condensate @xmath7 .",
    "an interesting interpretation of these corrections is that they are s - duality invariant in the sense defined by gaillard and zumino @xcite .",
    "this s - duality , which is an sl(2,r ) symmetry among elementary fields , is a symmetry of the equations of motion only of the dilaton - gauge - gravity sector in the limit of vanishing gauge coupling constants .",
    "the implication of this s - duality for gaugino condensation has recently been studied in @xcite using the chiral multiplet formalism .    for studies of gaugino condensation in the past where the important constraint ( 2.12 ) was not included",
    ", the connection between static and dynamical gaugino condensation is very easy to see and trivial : static gaugino condensation is just the low - energy limit of dynamical gaugino condensation after the gaugino condensate is integrated out .",
    "however , it certainly becomes a non - trivial issue once the constraint ( 2.12 ) is included , and it is necessary to settle this issue in order to justify the use of static gaugino condensation in the context of superstrings or supergravity .",
    "therefore , in this chapter we would like to study generic models of dynamical gaugino condensation . in section 3.2",
    ", the field component lagrangian for the generic model of dynamical gaugino condensation is constructed , and its vacuum structure is analyzed . in section 3.3 ,",
    "the s - dual models of dynamical gaugino condensation are studied . in particular",
    ", we show that the model of static gaugino condensation is the appropriate effective description for the model of dynamical gaugino condensation and its implications .",

    "the signs of the first term and the third term in @xmath288 remain undetermined in general ; however , near the weak - coupling limit the first term is positive and the third term is negative ( which is expected because the third term is the contribution of auxiliary fields @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) .",

    "s - dual loop corrections play no role in this issue , and s - dual loop corrections alone can not stabilize the dilaton . as discussed in section 2.4 , ( 3.52 ) can also be interpreted as the necessary condition for the dilaton to be stabilized .      in the previous section , the dynamical model of gaugino condensation",

    "this includes the usual suppression factor @xmath676 , where @xmath677 is the effective squared coupling constant at the string scale . however , there are also other important parameters that determine the scale of the hierarchy between the supersymmetry breaking scale and the planck scale .",

    "more phenomenological discussions of the model constructed in this chapter will be presented in chapter 5 .",
    "there has been interest in the question as to whether the linear and chiral multiplet formalisms are equivalent at the quantum level .",
    "they are presumably equivalent in the sense that technically we may always perform a duality transformation at the superfield level on the lagrangian ( 4.5 ) so as to recast it entirely in terms of chiral supermultiplets .",
    "the resulting effective lagrangian should be the chiral multiplet formalism with the gaugino condensates constrained by ( 2.12 ) , and it is apt to be rather complicated @xcite .",

    "in fact , this specific feature has to do with the cancellation of the cosmological constant . in our model",
    ", it is implicitly assumed that the mechanism which breaks supersymmetry is also responsible for the cancellation of the cosmological constant , which is the minimal and most economical assumption . with this assumption",
    ", @xmath762 leads to @xmath763 . according to ( 4.27 ) , the kinetic term of dilaton contains the small factor @xmath764 , which therefore leads to an enhancement of the mass of dilaton . on the other hand",
    ", there is so far very little insight about how the cosmological constant problem should be solved .",
    "it is possible that there are other sources which could contribute to the cancellation of cosmological constant .",
    "however , a detailed analysis of these more complicated scenarios is beyond the scope of our study here .",
    "we wish to emphasize that , even if @xmath765 might turn out to be , for example , an @xmath632 number in some other more complicated solutions to the cosmological constant problem , the natural hierarchy between the dilaton / moduli and squark / slepton masses still exists as long as gaugino condensation is the major source of supersymmetry breaking ; in this case we have @xmath766 tev and @xmath767 tev .",
    "the invisible axion is an elegant solution to the strong cp problem . in string theory , there seem to be many such axion candidates .",
    "however , as for the weakly - coupled superstring , it has been argued that qcd can not be the dominant contribution to the potential of any string axion @xcite , and therefore none of the string axions is qualified for the qcd axion . for string axions associated with the compactification @xmath28 moduli ,",
    "peccei - quinn symmetries are significantly broken by world - sheet instanton effects @xcite .",
    "for the string model - independent axion , it has been argued ( again using the _ unconstrained _ chiral multiplet formalism ) that the model - independent axion can not be the qcd axion due to stringy non - perturbative effects ( of order @xmath768 for the superpotential of dilaton ) @xcite . on the other hand , in the realistic model constructed in chapter 4 where stringy non - perturbative effects are fully included using the linear multiplet formalism , the model - independent axion does have the right features to be the qcd axion .",
    "the resolution for the stringy non - perturbative contribution , @xmath768 , to the superpotential of the dilaton is simple and impressive : as argued in @xcite using the chiral multiplet formalism , it seems plausible that there should be significant @xmath769 contributions to the superpotential of dilaton , leading to the qcd axion problem raised by banks and dine @xcite . on the other hand , in the linear multiplet formalism of string effective theory where the dilaton is represented by a vector superfield @xmath20 ,",
    "it is simply impossible to write down any @xmath20-dependent contribution ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath770 ) to the superpotential  a constraint coming from holomorphy .",
    "therefore , in the linear multiplet formalism the qcd axion problem of banks and dine @xcite is resolved in an elegant way , and one should re - examine the attractive possibility of the string model - independent axion being the qcd axion in this framework .    for any of the string axions to solve the strong cp problem",
    ", there is also a cosmological constraint .",
    "cosmological considerations require the decay constant @xmath771 of the invisible axion to lie between @xmath772 gev and @xmath773 gev ( the so - called axion window @xcite ) .",
    "the upper bound on the axion decay constant , @xmath774 gev , is due to the requirement that the energy density of the coherent oscillations of the axion be less than the critical density of the universe @xcite .",
    "however , in superstring theory the axion decay constant @xmath771 is naturally of order the planck scale , and therefore the cosmological upper bound on @xmath771 is seriously violated .",
    "although it was shown by choi and kim @xcite that the decay constant @xmath771 of the model - independent axion in the weakly - coupled heterotic string theory actually is @xmath775 gev , this is still much larger than the cosmological upper bound . on the other hand",
    ", cosmological constraints could be quite scheme - dependent ; for example , it has been pointed out that the entropy production due to the decays of massive particles dilutes the axion density and therefore raise the upper bound on @xmath771 @xcite .",
    "based on the above idea kawasaki , moroi and yanagida @xcite have proposed a refined scenario where the polonyi fields of supergravity models are natural candidates for entropy production . the new cosmological upper bound on @xmath771 in this scheme is : @xmath776 where @xmath777 is the mass of the polonyi field . in order to keep successful primordial nucleosynthesis in this scheme , @xmath777 should be larger than about 10 tev . with @xmath778 tev , @xmath779 gev and",
    "therefore the string model - independent axion is almost consistent with this new upper bound .",
    "however , @xmath780 tev seems un - natural according to the standard lore of string phenomenology where one expects @xmath781 tev . on the contrary ,",
    "the cosmological scenario of kawasaki _ et al _ naturally occurs in our model constructed in chapter 4 . as discussed in section 5.2 , in our model",
    "there is a natural hierarchy between the moduli and gravitino masses ( @xmath759 tev ) , and therefore the decays of moduli serve the purpose of raising the cosmological upper bound on @xmath771 to a value consistent with the @xmath771 of string model - independent axion .",
    "this natural hierarchy is indeed a desirable feature of our model since it not only could solve the cosmological moduli problem but also keeps the energy density of the oscillations of string model - independent axion from overclosing the universe .",
    "one particularly interesting aspect of our model constructed using the linear multiplet formalism of gaugino condensation in chapter 4 is axion physics .",
    "pseudoscalar fields are the phases @xmath513 of the condensates and the so - called model - independent axion which is dual to the fundamental antisymmetric tensor field .",
    "the latter couples in a universal way to the @xmath782 term of each gauge subgroup . if again we look at the dynamical model with one @xmath381 gaugino condensate in chapter 3 , we find that out of the two possible pseudoscalar the condensate phase is very heavy whereas the string model - independent axion remains massless .",
    "this is obviously the supersymmetric counterpart of what happens with the scalars .",
    "if we allow for more than one gaugino condensate , the model - independent axion acquires a very small mass ( typically exponentially suppressed relative to the gravitino mass by a factor of order @xmath783 in the two - condensate case according to ( 4.73 ) ) .",
    "furthermore , as we have seen in section 5.2 , the axions associated with the @xmath28 moduli get masses of order @xmath784 .",
    "therefore , we are always left with only one very light axion , the model - independent axion , and it has the right properties to be the qcd axion .",
    "remember that there are two kinds of non - perturbative effects in our model ( _ i.e. _ , the field - theoretical non - perturbative effects of hidden - sector gaugino condensation constrained by ( 2.12 ) and stringy non - perturbative effects ) , and they are best described using the linear multiplet formalism .",
    "in contrast to the argument against the string model - independent axion as the qcd axion @xcite in the presence of generic stringy non - perturbative effects using the _ unconstrained _ chiral multiplet formalism , in our model the model - independent axion can indeed be the qcd axion . as explained before ,",
    "the reason why the model - independent axion has the desirable features in the linear multiplet formalism are a correct treatment of gaugino condensation and the fact that such stringy non - perturbative effects of dilaton are actually forbidden in the superpotential due to holomorphy . as for the decay constant @xmath785 of the model - independent axion in our model",
    ", there is an additional reduction factor of @xmath786 compared to the result obtained by choi and kim @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section 5.2 , this reduction factor comes from the fact that the kinetic term of dilaton in ( 4.27 ) contains the small factor @xmath763 when @xmath787 is imposed .",
    "more precisely , this reduction factor is about @xmath788 if the gravitino mass is about 1 tev .",
    "besides the fact that the cosmological scenario of kawasaki _ et al _ naturally occurs in our model , this reduction in the model - independent axion s decay constant is certainly desirable from the viewpoint of the cosmological upper bound on @xmath771 .",
    "indeed , with this reduction factor the axion decay constant in our model is @xmath789 gev , which is truly consistent with the upper bound on @xmath771 ( @xmath790 gev ) imposed by the scenario of kawasaki _",
    "et al_.      in contrast to the studies of moduli and axion , the analysis of soft supersymmetry breaking parameters is much more sensitive to the very details of a string model .",
    "unfortunately , our current knowledge of string models is still limited .",
    "although in the following we will try to discuss soft supersymmetry breaking parameters in a model - independent way whenever it is possible , yet it should be kept in mind that our analysis can not cover all the interesting possibilities and therefore should not be regarded as final .",
    "it is straightforward to compute the soft supersymmetry breaking terms , that are generated at the condensation scale @xmath791 , for our model constructed in chapter 2 .",
    "the gaugino masses @xmath792 are : @xmath793 notice that the expression of gaugino masses contains the small factor @xmath764 discussed at the end of section 5.2 , and therefore gaugino masses are suppressed by @xmath794 after @xmath787 is imposed .",
    "therefore , it is possible that this suppression of gaugino masses could be relieved in models with a more complicated mechanism of cosmological constant cancellation .",
    "the soft terms in the scalar potential are sensitive to the  as yet unknown  details of matter - dependent contributions to the green - schwarz counterterm and string threshold corrections .",
    "we neglect the former , and write the green - schwarz counterterm as follows : @xmath795 where the @xmath400 are gauge nonsinglet chiral superfields , the @xmath796 are their modular weights , and the full khler potential reads @xmath797 under these assumptions , the scalar masses and cubic `` @xmath185 terms '' are given , respectively , by the following : @xmath798 + { \\rm h.c.}\\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & { 1\\over 4}e^{k/2}\\bar{u}_+\\[\\,\\sum_a{p_a - b_+\\over1+p_a\\ell } \\phi^aw_a(\\phi ) + { 3b_+\\over1+b_+\\ell}w(\\phi ) \\,\\ ] + { \\rm h.c . } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath799 and @xmath800 is the cubic superpotential for chiral matter superfields .",
    "note that the squared scalar masses are always positive . as concluded in section 4.6",
    ", we find in our model that moduli @xmath195 are stabilized at the self - dual point and their associated @xmath801 vanish in the vacuum , which results in a dilaton - dominated supersymmetry breaking scenario . according to ( 5.9 ) ,",
    "both the scalar masses and @xmath185 terms are indeed independent of their modular weights by virtue of the fact that @xmath802 . for the fcnc constraints ,",
    "this feature of dilaton - dominated scenario is a potential advantage over a moduli - dominant scenario . in the past , it was generally believed that a dilaton - dominated scenario results in universal soft supersymmetry breaking parameters due to the universality of dilaton couplings @xcite .",
    "however , here we wish to stress that the above statement did not take into account the matter - dependent contributions to the green - schwarz counterterm , and therefore a dilaton - dominated scenario does not guarantee universal soft supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "it is clear from the computations of our dilaton - dominated scenario in ( 5.9 ) that soft supersymmetry breaking parameters are universal  and unwanted flavor - changing neutral currents are thereby suppressed  if the matter couplings ( @xmath803 ) to the green - schwarz counterterm are also universal .",
    "unfortunately , so far there is little knowledge of @xmath803 s ; therefore , the best we can do right now is to study the consequences of several seemingly reasonable choices of @xmath803 s .",
    "one possibility is that @xmath803 s are universal ; thus we have universal soft supersymmetry breaking parameters and in this case @xmath185 terms in ( 5.9 ) reduce to @xmath804 for example , if the green - schwarz counterterm is simply independent of the matter fields @xmath400 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath805 ) , we have @xmath806 . as for choices of non - universal @xmath803 s ,",
    "a possibility is that the green - schwarz counterterm depends only on the radii @xmath807 of the three compact tori that determine the untwisted - sector part of the khler potential ( 5.8 ) : @xmath808 where @xmath809 in string units . in this case , @xmath810 for the untwisted chiral superfields @xmath811 , and @xmath805 for the twisted chiral superfields @xmath812 .",
    "the untwisted scalars have masses comparable to the moduli masses : @xmath813 . finally , we note that if @xmath814 , gaugino masses are suppressed relative to the gravitino mass at the condensation scale @xmath815 : @xmath816 . if there is a sector with @xmath817 and a yukawa coupling of order one involving @xmath460 ( anti- ) triplets ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath818 , where @xmath36 is a standard model singlet ) , its two - loop contribution to gaugino masses @xcite can be more important than the standard one - loop contribution , generating a physical mass for gluinos that is well within experimental bounds for @xmath761 tev . such a coupling could also generate a _ vev _ for @xmath36 , thus breaking possible additional @xmath575 s at a scale @xmath819 tev .",
    "the phenomenologically required @xmath70 term of the mssm may also be generated by the _ vev _ of a standard model gauge singlet or by one of the other mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of universal @xmath803 s , for the case of non - universal @xmath803 s one has to worry about the fcnc problem .",
    "scenarios in which the sparticles of the first two generations have masses as high as @xmath820 tev have in fact been proposed @xcite to solve the fcnc problem .",
    "however , it has recently been pointed out that such scenarios may suffer from a negative scalar top mass squared driven by two - loop renormalization group evolution @xcite .",
    "clearly , a better understanding of the matter dependence of the green - schwarz counterterm is required to make precise predictions for soft supersymmetry breaking .",
    "nevertheless our model suggests soft supersymmetry breaking patterns that may differ significantly from those generally assumed in the context of the mssm .",
    "phenomenological constraints such as current limits on sparticle masses , gauge coupling unification and a charge and color invariant vacuum can be used to restrict the allowed values of @xmath501 s as well as the low - energy spectrum of the string effective field theory . to conclude",
    ", we would like to stress that the model presented above is certainly not final and some of the results obtained , especially on the low - energy sector of the theory , may receive modifications .",
    "possible sources of modification are the presence of an anomalous @xmath575 symmetry @xcite or a constant term in the superpotential that breaks modular invariance @xcite .",
    "string non - perturbative corrections necessary to stabilize the dilaton could make significant corrections to the unification of gauge couplings . the functions @xmath821 and @xmath822 introduced above and the threshold corrections whose form is dictated by @xmath645 duality invariance contribute as follows to the value of couplings at unification : @xmath823 with @xmath824 let us note however that this parameter is worth @xmath825 in the perturbative case and @xmath826 in the one gaugino condensate model .",
    "let us take this opportunity to clarify a confusing statement in the literature about gauge coupling unification in weakly - coupled superstring .",
    "it is often stated that one can determine from the low - energy values of gauge couplings the precise value of the gauge coupling unification scale , @xmath827 , to be the @xmath828 gev based on the mssm .",
    "we think that this is a misleading statement since most string models constructed so far that hold a claim for being realistic include new forms of matter which perturb the evolution of the gauge couplings at some intermediate threshold @xcite . in fact , as for the string models considered in this study , the unification scale @xmath827 should naturally be the string scale @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the compactification scale @xmath739 is also close to the string scale because the compactification moduli are stabilized at the self - dual point .",
    "therefore , one naturally expects @xmath829    finally , let s make a short remark on the newton s constant @xmath830 . for the weakly - coupled heterotic string , it has been shown by e. witten @xcite that there exists a lower bound on the newton s constant as follows .",
    "@xmath831 if one simply takes @xmath739 to be @xmath17 , the resulting lower bound on the newton s constant is indeed too large . on the other hand , in our study the compactification moduli",
    "are actually stabilized at the self - dual point , @xmath738 .",
    "therefore , the compactification scale is quite close to the string scale . according to ( 5.14 )",
    ", one should take @xmath739 to be of order @xmath24 , and the resulting lower bound on the newton s constant is of order @xmath832 .",
    "this lower bound on @xmath830 is certainly small enough .",
    "as discussed in chapter 1 , the weakly - coupled heterotic string theory is known to have problems with dilaton / moduli stabilization , supersymmetry breaking , gauge coupling unification , qcd axion , as well as cosmological problems involving dilaton / moduli and axion . in the literature",
    "some of these problems are often treated as evidence against the weakly - coupled heterotic string theory .",
    "however , it is actually hard to say whether these problems are inherent to the weakly - coupled heterotic string theory or they simply reflect our ignorance of important string dynamics .",
    "furthermore , some of these problems will probably re - appear even in the study of the strong - coupling limit of the heterotic string theory . in this work we study these problems by adopting the point of view that they arise mostly due to our limited calculational power , little knowledge of of the full vacuum structure , and an inappropriate treatment of gaugino condensation .",
    "indeed , after a careful review one finds that the phenomenological studies of the weakly - coupled heterotic string theory in the literature contain several essential flaws .",
    "it is therefore of utmost importance to correct these flaws and then re - examine the problems of weakly - coupled heterotic string theory . in conclusion ,",
    "three essential changes to the standard lore of string phenomenology have to be made .",
    "the first essential change is about the effective field theory of the weakly - coupled heterotic string .",
    "it is emphasized that the linear multiplet formalism rather than the chiral multiplet formalism is the appropriate framework for the effective field theory of the weakly - coupled heterotic string .",
    "the second essential change is the inclusion of possible stringy non - perturbative effects in addition to the usual field - theoretical non - perturbative effects produced by gaugino condensation .",
    "the third essential change is an improved treatment of gaugino condensation by including the constraint ( 2.12 ) . as discussed in chapter 2 , the last two changes are most naturally implemented using the linear multiplet formalism .",
    "finally , notice that full modular invariance is always maintained in our construction .",
    "this is important because modular invariance is supposed to be an exact quantum symmetry of closed string theory @xcite .    in chapters 24 ,",
    "the linear multiplet formalism with the aforementioned features is constructed for an e@xmath833 model as well as a generic orbifold model .",
    "it is particularly transparent in this framework to realize how the dilaton can be stabilized by stringy non - perturbative contributions to the khler potential .",
    "furthermore , supersymmetry can be broken at a realistic scale once the dilaton is stabilized .",
    "as for the moduli , they are always stabilized at their self - dual points where the moduli actually do not contribute to supersymmetry breaking  a beautiful consequence of modular invariance and an appropriate treatment of gaugino condensation .",
    "phenomenologically , we always have a dilaton - dominated scenario of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the fact that the compactification moduli are stabilized at the self - dual point also leads to a small enough lower bound on the newton s constant @xcite . as for the masses of moduli , in contrast to the standard lore of string phenomenology a careful analysis reveals that there is a natural hierarchy between moduli and gravitino masses .",
    "it is not difficult to see how this hierarchy arises : in a generic orbifold model with realistic supersymmetry breaking scale , there is already a natural hierarchy between the e@xmath18 @xmath46-function coefficient @xmath703 ( associated with the green - schwarz counterterm ) and the @xmath834 of the largest hidden gauge subgroup ( @xmath758 ) .",
    "such a hierarchy between moduli and gravitino masses has important cosmological consequences .",
    "as discussed in chapter 5 , it not only could solve the cosmological moduli problem but also keeps the energy density of the oscillations of the string model - independent axion from overclosing the universe . as for the strong cp problem , there is always only one very light axion ( the model - independent axion ) in our model , and it does have the right features to be the qcd axion in contrast to the conclusion of banks and dine @xcite . the difference between our result and that of banks and dine has to do with our improved treatment of gaugino condensation and a holomorphy argument associated with the linear multiplet which is unique to the linear multiplet formalism . in conclusion , it is fair to say that these problems of the weakly - coupled heterotic string theory can be solved or are much less severe .",
    "as expected , the origin of the cosmological constant remains a mystery here although it is indeed under better control and the cosmological constant can be fine tuned to zero in our treatment . again , a final resolution of this problem might have to wait for a complete understanding of superstring dynamics .",
    "the other unsettled issue in this work is the soft supersymmetry breaking pattern .",
    "although our model always predicts a dilaton - dominated scenario of supersymmetry breaking , yet in contrast to the standard lore of string phenomenology we point out that whether a dilaton - dominated scenario predicts universal soft supersymmetry breaking parameters actually depends on whether the matter couplings to the green - schwarz counterterm are universal . to settle this issue , a better understanding of the matter dependence of the green - schwarz counterterm for generic string models is certainly required ; it deserves further studies and could lead to a rich phenomenology .",
    "another potential problem of this work is that the gaugino masses might be too small . whether this is a serious problem or not can be very model - dependent , especially in the context of superstrings where one generically encounters scenarios beyond the mssm . in conclusion ,",
    "we emphasize that this work is certainly not final , and it is very important to understand more about the non - perturbative aspects of superstrings , realistic string model building and the phenomenology . after a careful re - examination of the aforementioned problems of the weakly - coupled heterotic string theory",
    ", it is also hoped that those misunderstandings of the current status of weakly - coupled heterotic string theory in the literature are clarified by this work .",

    "<S> the weakly - coupled heterotic string is known to have problems of dilaton / moduli stabilization , supersymmetry breaking ( by hidden - sector gaugino condensation ) , gauge coupling unification ( or the newton s constant ) , qcd axion , as well as cosmological problems involving dilaton / moduli and axion . </S>",
    "<S> we study these problems by adopting the point of view that they arise mostly due to our limited calculational power , little knowledge of the full vacuum structure , and an inappropriate treatment of gaugino condensation . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that these problems can be solved or are much less severe after a more consistent and complete treatment .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two kinds of non - perturbative effects in our construction of string effective field theory : the field - theoretical non - perturbative effects of gaugino condensation ( with a constraint ignored in the past ) and the stringy non - perturbative effects conjectured by s.h . </S>",
    "<S> shenker , which are best described using the linear multiplet formalism . </S>",
    "<S> stringy non - perturbative corrections to the khler potential are invoked to stabilize the dilaton at a value compatible with a weak coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> modular invariance is ensured through the green - schwarz counterterm and string threshold corrections which , together with hidden matter condensation , lead to moduli stabilization at the self - dual point where the _ vev _ s of moduli s @xmath0 components vanish . in the vacuum , supersymmetry is broken at a realistic scale with vanishing cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> as for soft supersymmetry breaking , our model always leads to a dilaton - dominated scenario . for the strong cp problem , the model - independent axion has the right properties to be the qcd axion . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , there is a natural hierarchy between the dilaton / moduli mass and the gravitino mass , which could solve both the cosmological moduli problem and the cosmological problem of the model - independent axion .    </S>",
