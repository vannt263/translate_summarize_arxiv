    "we let , for simplicity , @xmath26 the laplacian of @xmath3 is again the generator of a continuous - time markov chain called the _ interchange process _ on @xmath15 .",
    "it can be described as follows : each site of @xmath15 is occupied by a particle of a different color , and for each edge @xmath27 , at rate 1 , the particles at vertices @xmath11 and @xmath28 are exchanged .",
    "it is easy to show ( it follows from and , but there are simpler and more direct proofs ) that the spectrum of @xmath12 is a subset of the spectrum of @xmath29 . by consequence @xmath30 being an @xmath31 matrix , in general",

    "version 1 also appears in @xcite , under the extra assumption of @xmath0 being bipartite .",
    "aldous s conjecture comes in a third flavor , which originates from the analysis of the representations of the symmetric group . and [ sec : lap ] .",
    "] from this point of view the laplacian @xmath12 corresponds to the @xmath1-dimensional _ defining _ representation of @xmath2 , whose irreducible components are the trivial representation and the representation associated with the partition @xmath33 .",

    "one finds ( see section [ sec : lap ] ) that aldous s conjecture can be restated as follows :    if @xmath0 is a finite connected simple graph , then @xmath41 for each nontrivial partition @xmath36 of @xmath1 ,   for each partition @xmath42 .",
    "aldous s conjecture has been proven for star - graphs in @xcite and for complete graphs in @xcite .",
    "a major progress was made in @xcite ( similar results were reobtained in @xcite ) , where a rather general technique was developed , which can be used to prove the conjecture for trees ( with weighted edges ) and a few other cases . without entering into the details , we mention that this technique is useful for classes of graphs whose spectral gap `` tends to decrease '' when a new site , and relative edges , are added to a preexisting graph .",
    "this is indeed the case of trees , since it is not too difficult to prove that adding a leaf with its relative edge can not increase the spectral gap . using this approach , aldous s conjecture has been recently proven @xcite , @xcite for hypercubes _ asymptotically _ ,   in the limit as the side length of the cube tends to infinity .",
    "the main result of the present paper is the proof of aldous s conjecture for _ complete multipartite graphs _ ( theorem [ th : main ] ) . these are graphs such that it is possible to write the vertex set of @xmath0 as a disjoint union @xmath43 in such a way that @xmath20 is an edge if and only if @xmath11 and @xmath28 belong to distinct @xmath44 s .",
