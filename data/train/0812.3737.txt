    "many characteristics of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have been revealed by the previous observations , and now it is widely believed that grbs are the one of the most powerful explosion in the universe , originating at cosmological distances .",
    "the association with the energetic supernovae was found for some long duration grbs .",
    "this provides a strong evidence that the progenitor of the long grbs is the core collapse of a massive star .",
    "the observed prompt gamma - ray spectra are often fitted well by a smoothly connected broken power - law called as the band function ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , we are still not able to uniquely associate the measured properties to the radiation mechanism of the prompt gamma - ray emission .",
    "although , the observed behavior of grbs , such as the intensity and the peak energy of the @xmath6 spectrum ( @xmath7 ) are dramatically different from burst to burst , some clear correlations between these parameters were reported , such as the correlation between isotropic equivalent radiation energy @xmath8 and the peak energy in the rest frame of the burst ( @xmath9 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , or the isotropic equivalent peak luminosity @xmath10 and the @xmath9 ( @xcite ) , and the total radiation energy corrected for the jet opening angle and the @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these relations are often used to estimate the inferred redshift value , and yonetoku et al .",
    "( 2003 ) estimated redshift for large batse sample and found that some of them have large redshift with z @xmath11 10 .",
    "such high - z grbs are important to constrain the cosmological parameters .",
    "furthermore , the same kind of correlation have been reported not only for each burst but also for individual pulses of a burst internally .",
    "several authors studied this hardness - intensity correlation ( hic ) for time - resolved spectral analysis .",
    "golenetski et al .",
    "1983 found a power - law correlation between observed energy flux and the spectral characteristic energy e@xmath12 , and the power - law correlation index was found to be a typical value of 1.5 - 1.7 .",
    "kargatis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) confirmed this correlation but the power - law index showed a larger spread .",
    "they obtained the power - law index of 2.2@xmath131.0 .",
    "strohmayer et al . (",
    "1998 ) also found that this power - law correlation is valid using ginga data .",
    "borgonovo & ryde ( 2001 ) also studied this correlation by strong batse sample .",
    "they found the specific feature that there is the sharp transition from one power - law track to the second track with the same power - law index in the decay phase of the pulse .",
    "they explained this track - jump behavior as the transition to a new pulse .",
    "the fact that the hic holds for both each pulse and within the pulse implies that the same physical condition is realized in each pulse .",
    "therefore , to investigate this relation it is very important to consider the radiation mechanism of the grb prompt emission .",
    "recently , liang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) analyzed the @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the 2408 time - resolved spectra for 91 batse grbs , assuming that the burst rate as a function of redshift is proportional to the star formation rate .",
    "yoshida et al . (",
    "2007 ) measured the @xmath14 and @xmath15 value for time - resolved spectra of hete-2 bursts .",
    "both of them found that @xmath16 , and yoshida et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that this relation is tighter for each spike - averaged spectra rather than that of simply 5.2 s - divided spectra .",
    "therefore , this relation could be different for finer time - resolved spectra .",
    "however , most of previous analysis was done using data for each pulse or for the decay phase of such pulses , while the detailed properties of time - resolved spectra , including initial rising phase for each pulse have not been considered and thus are still ambiguous . in this paper , we report on the time - resolved spectroscopy of the bright long grb 061007 observed by the suzaku / wam and swift / bat .",
    "this burst was also observed by many ground - based telescopes and the redshift was measured to be 1.261 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and schady et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested that this burst has an early jet break time which is within 80 s of the prompt emission , and a highly collimated outflow is likely case for this burst . using this bright burst with a measured redshift",
    ", we can investigate the relation between @xmath14 and @xmath9 within each pulse , including both the pulse - rise and the decay phase .",
    "this is possible since suzaku / wam has the largest effective area from 300 kev to 5 mev than any previous missions .",
    "furthermore , since swift / bat covers an energy range from 15 kev to 150 kev , the joint analysis using suzaku / wam and swift / bat gives us further constraints on the spectral parameters .",
    "therefore , this joint , broad - band suzaku / wam and swift / bat analysis allows the excellent time - resolved spectral analysis with both fine time resolution and high sensitivity .",
    "we also investigate the time - averaged properties of this burst such as @xmath8 ",
    "@xmath9 ( amati ) relation and @xmath14  @xmath15 ( yonetoku ) relation in order to compare with other bursts .",
    "thus , we denote our `` time - resolved '' peak energy and luminosity relation as @xmath17 ",
    "@xmath18 relation in this paper to distinguish from those time - averaged relationships .",
    "the suzaku / wam ( wam ) is the active shield of the hard x - ray detector ( hxd - ii ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) onboard suzaku ( @xcite ) .",
    "it consists of large and thick bgo crystals and it is also designed to monitor the all - sky flux over the 50 kev to 5 mev band .",
    "it has the largest effective area from 300 kev to 5 mev of all grb missions and thus enables us to perform a wide - band spectroscopy of grbs with a high sensitivity ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there is still uncertainty in the detector response matrices of the wam and the observed flux fluctuates by 10 - 20% on average and about 40% at the maximum depending on the incident azimuthal ( @xmath19 ) and zenith ( @xmath20 ) angle of grbs ( @xcite ) .",
    "we found that this uncertainty ( as compared to the pre - flight calibration ) is mainly caused by the absorption by the structures attached inside the satellite panel .",
    "we confirmed that this trend is the same even in the in - orbit environment by the cross - calibration between swift / bat and konus - wind , using the data of simultaneously detected grbs ( sakamoto et al .",
    "2008 in preparation ) .",
    "the wam outputs two data types , the transient ( trn ) data and the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) data .",
    "the trn data are always accumulated with 1 sec time resolution and 55 energy channels .",
    "this can be used to monitor the bright soft gamma - ray sources with the earth occultation method , as was done by the cgro / batse ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the grb data are recorded for 64 sec only when the grb trigger is activated , and the data cover 8 sec before and 56 sec after the trigger time .",
    "the grb data have four energy channels with 1/64 sec time resolution , in addition to the spectral data in 55 pulse height channels with 0.5 sec time resolution .",
    "grb061007 triggered the wam at 10:08:05 ut , october 07 , 2006 ( t@xmath12(wam ) ) .",
    "three large peaks as well as a following smaller peak were clearly seen in the wam light curve as shown in figure [ grb061007_wamgrblc ] .",
    "gamma - ray photons are strongly detected by the wam-3 detector .",
    "the t@xmath21 duration of this burst was about 59 seconds in the 50 - 5000 kev band ( @xcite ) .",
    "since this burst was so long that the emission lasted more than 56 s after the wam trigger , the grb data system could not record the whole emission profile .",
    "this is why the light curve of the wam grb data look truncated above 56 s ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "based on the position information of this burst provided by the swift as mentioned below , the incident direction against the wam detector was found to be ( @xmath20 , @xmath19 ) = ( 92 , 198 ) .",
    "this incident direction is consistent with the strong detection by the wam-3 detector , and the detector response of this direction is known to be reliable by the pre - flight and in - orbit calibrations .",
    "the uncertainties of the response matrix should be within 20 - 30% for this burst .",
    "the swift / bat ( bat ) was also triggered by grb 061007 , 3 s after the wam trigger , at 10:08:08 ut , october 07 , 2006 .",
    "the refined bat position for this burst was ra = @xmath22 dec = @xmath23 ( j2000 ) with an uncertainty of 0.9@xmath24 at 90% containment ( @xcite ) .",
    "the bat light curve showed a multi - peaked structure with a duration of about 100 seconds .",
    "the swift / xrt and swift / uvot observed this burst 80 s and 400 s after the bat trigger , respectively , and they found a bright fading source .",
    "although , the main purpose of this study is to investigate the behavior of the time - resolved spectra of grb 061007 , before we perform the time - resolved spectral analysis , the time - averaged spectral parameters have been also investigated .",
    "we utilize the transient ( trn ) data for the wam because grb data of the wam do not contain the whole emission of this burst due to its long duration .",
    "therefore , we can analyze only 1-sec time resolution data for this analysis .",
    "we perform the spectral analysis by applying three spectral models .",
    "the first one is a simple power law ( pl ) model :    @xmath25    where a is the normalization constant at 100 kev in photons @xmath26 s@xmath27 kev @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the power law photon index .    the second model is a power law with an exponential cutoff ( cpl ) :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the peak energy in the @xmath31 spectrum and it represents the energy at which most of the power is emitted .",
    "the third model is a smoothly connected broken power law model known as the band model ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath32^{(\\alpha-\\beta ) } { \\rm exp}(\\beta -        \\alpha ) , \\nonumber\\\\ & & { \\rm for}~ e \\geq   \\frac{(\\alpha-\\beta)e_{\\rm peak}}{(2+\\alpha ) }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 is the power law photon index in the lower energy band , and",
    "@xmath33 is that in higher energy band .",
    "in addition , in these basic models , we add the constant factor when we perform the joint spectral analysis between the wam and the bat to take into account for the uncertainties of the detector response matrix of the wam . throughout this analysis",
    ", we fit the spectrum from 120 kev to 5000 kev for the wam and from 13 kev to 150 kev for the bat , respectively .    in order to extract the dead - time corrected light curve and the spectrum , we use the standard ftools ; hxdmkwamspec and hxdmkwamlc for transient data , and hxdmkbstlc and hxdmkbstspec for grb data , which are included in the heasoft software package version 6.0.6 ( http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/ ) .",
    "we also apply a 2% systematic error to the wam spectrum only for the time - averaged spectral analysis due to its high counting rate .",
    "we also derive the light curve and the spectra from swift / bat data for joint spectral analysis .",
    "when we extract the spectrum or light curve from the bat event data , we use the standard ftools ; batbinevt , after we re - processed the energy calibration , making the detector quality map and mask weighting , using the latest version of the software and calibration data base . we also apply systematic error for the bat spectra , using batphasyserr script .",
    "the systematic error vector is retrieved from the calibration data base .",
    "we use the xspec version 11.3.2 for spectral analysis ( @xcite ) .",
    "all quoted error are 90% confidence level .",
    "we can see that the emission profile is well separated into first weak fred like structure and second bright , multi - peaked episode .",
    "therefore , firstly , we divide this burst into two time regions .",
    "the first time region named as interval a is selected from t@xmath12(wam)-2.0 s to t@xmath12(wam)+18.0 s , where t@xmath12(wam ) means the wam triggered time , and the second time region of the interval b is from t@xmath12(wam)+27.0 sec to t@xmath12(wam)+87.0 sec .",
    "we also analyze the integrated time region from t@xmath12(wam)-2.0 sec to t@xmath12(wam)+85.0 sec .",
    "we also extract the bat spectra from the same time interval as that of the wam in order to perform the joint spectral analysis .",
    "the selected time region is shown in the light curve of the wam and bat in figure [ grb061007_trnlcandspec ] .",
    "the best - fit parameters obtained by the joint analysis for each time region are shown in table [ bestfit_timeavegrb061007 ] .",
    "figure [ grb061007_trnlcandspec ] shows the spectra of the joint analysis with the wam and the bat for whole time region ( a+b ) .",
    "we find that the spectrum of this burst can be described by the typical band model for each time interval .",
    "we obtain the photon index of low - energy part , @xmath28 of @xmath34 , photon index of high - energy part , @xmath33 of @xmath35 , and the peak energy , @xmath30 of 354@xmath36 kev , 468 ( @xmath37 ) kev , 460 ( @xmath38 ) kev , for interval a , b , and a+b , respectively .",
    "these spectral parameters are consistent with that of reported by konus - wind ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 100 - 1000 kev fluence and the peak flux in 1-s time scale is measured to be 1.6 ( @xmath39 ) @xmath40 erg @xmath26 and 14.5 ( @xmath41 ) photons s@xmath27 @xmath26 , respectively",
    ". the constant factor of the wam against the bat is about 1.10 for any time regions .",
    "these values are consistent with the current uncertainties of the response matrix of the wam .",
    "furthermore , we find that the spectral parameters can be tightly constrained by the joint analysis between the wam and the bat .",
    "we also investigate other spectral properties of this burst using the spectrum of the whole time interval ( a+b ) .",
    "first , we measure the hardness ratio between 100 - 300 kev and 50 - 150 kev , using the fluence ratio based on the spectral fitting result and we obtain the value of 3.52 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we plot this value on the hardness - duration plane in figure [ grb061007_hrandamati ] ( left panel ) .",
    "we also plot the batse results together for comparison , and we find that this burst locate at the standard long / soft regime like batse results .",
    "then , we investigate the total emitting energy of this burst . we calculate the isotropic equivalent total energy @xmath8 from 1.0 to 10000 kev and the peak energy at the rest frame @xmath43 , using cosmological parameters ( h@xmath12 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) = ( 65 , 0.7 , 0.3 ) , and we obtain the @xmath8 of 1.0@xmath46 erg , and the @xmath47 of 1040@xmath48 kev , respectively .",
    "we plot this result in the @xmath43-@xmath8 plane and we show it in figure [ grb061007_hrandamati ] right . for long grbs",
    ", it is well known that there is a strong correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath47 ( amati relation ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we also plot the previous results reported by @xcite in the same figure , and we find that the @xmath8 and @xmath43 value of grb 061007 is quite consistent with amati relation .",
    "figure [ grb061007_yonetoku ] also shows a comparison of the @xmath8 and 1-sec peak luminosity ( yonetoku ) relation ( @xcite ) , and we find that grb 061007 also satisfies the yonetoku relation . from those time - averaged spectral analysis , we conclude that there is no large systematic problem in our analysis and that grb 061007 is a typical long grb with many common characteristics such as the duration , the spectral hardness , and the total emitting energy .      after we confirmed that there was no problem in the time - averaged spectral analysis between the wam and the bat ,",
    "we investigate the time - resolved spectral properties of this burst . in this analysis , we divide the wam data in 1.0 s time resolution .",
    "we also divided the bat data for the same time region .",
    "we extract total 58 time - resolved spectra and perform the spectral analysis with the same manner as that we used in the time - averaged analysis .",
    "the time - resolved spectra are also described by the cpl or band model .",
    "we can constrain the high energy photon index @xmath33 from only a few spectra which belong to the bright time region . therefore , we applied the fixed value of @xmath33 of @xmath49 which is obtained at the time - averaged spectral analysis . the best - fit parameters for 58-time - resolved spectra",
    "are shown in table [ grb061007_timeresolvedpar ] and [ grb061007_timeresolvedpar2 ] . from these time - resolved analysis",
    ", we find the evolution of the spectral shape during the burst .",
    "figure [ grb061007_ufu ] shows examples of the @xmath31 spectra with the best - fit band model for various intensity region , and the change of the spectral shape around the @xmath30 is clearly seen . in figure",
    "[ grb061007_bandlcpar ] , we present the best - fit parameters obtained by the band model fit as a function of time , and both the low energy photon index @xmath28 and the @xmath30 show a hard - to - soft tracking behavior correlated with the burst intensity . the low energy photon index @xmath28 changes between @xmath50 to @xmath51 with an average value of @xmath52 , which is consistent with the time integrated parameter of @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath30 also evolves within the burst , and it moves from 120 kev to 633 kev with an average value of 375 kev .",
    "figure [ epalpha ] shows the relation between low energy photon index , @xmath28 and the @xmath30 , and we find that only one time - resolved spectrum have the low energy photon index of flatter than @xmath54 , which is not allowed by the standard synchrotron shock scenario .",
    "from time - resolved spectral analysis , we find that the time - resolved @xmath30 ; @xmath55 changes are correlated with the burst intensity . in order to confirm this , we perform a correlation analysis between @xmath55 and time resolved luminosity ; @xmath56 for time - resolved spectra .",
    "the @xmath18 value is measured as the 1-sec time - averaged value for each of the time - resolved spectra in 30 kev to 10000 kev energy range .",
    "figure [ epliso ] shows the relation between @xmath55 and @xmath18 .",
    "we can see a clear positive correlation between these two parameters . to quantify this",
    ", we calculate the spearman rank - order coefficients ( @xmath57 ) , and we obtain the correlation coefficient of 0.78 .",
    "this coefficient corresponds to the significance probability that there is no correlation of 5.4 @xmath58 10@xmath59 .",
    "therefore , we confirm that the correlation surely exists at @xmath60 confidence level .",
    "we then fit this correlation by the simple power - law model like the hardness - intensity correlation , the amati relation , and the yonetoku relation .",
    "the fit gives a best fit parameter as , @xmath61    the power - law index slightly flatter than the value obtained by golenetskii et al .",
    "1983 but roughly agrees with the previous analysis by yonetoku 2004 ; @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , our data set can constrain both the power - law index and the normalization factor as well as the previous analysis using only one burst data set .",
    "the @xmath63 value for this fit is 83/56 and we still see a certain deviation in this relation around @xmath64 ( see figure 8) , and the data point which have large dispersion from this relation tend to have a higher @xmath55 value by a factor of 2 compared with many other data .",
    "we calculate the @xmath65 for each time region in order to separete these data point from other data which follow the equation([epliso_alldata ] ) . if the correlation follows @xmath66 for any time region , this parameter should retain constant . figure [ epoverliso045 ]",
    "shows the @xmath65 parameter as a function of time .",
    "we also show the best - fit constant value with 3 @xmath67 confidence region .",
    "the 8 data points ( t=4,5,6,7,31,32,48,50 ) exceed 3 @xmath67 limit of the constant value , and thus we consider these data points as the outliers on the @xmath68 plane .",
    "we confirm that these outliers with large dispersion from the main population are not caused by the systematic uncertainties in the analysis procedures such as the uncertainties of detector response matrix , systematic effect to the obtained spectral parameters , and the effect of the intense spectral evolution during the initial rising phase .",
    "the details of this verification processes are shown in the appendix .",
    "we then divide the derived parameter pairs into the main population , where the @xmath65 correlation is acceptable , and the outlier population , where that relation is broken at 3 @xmath67 significance .",
    "we calculate the correlation coefficient and perform the power - law fit for each population separately , and obtain the coefficients of 0.90 ( @xmath69 = 6.9 @xmath70 ) for the main population , and 0.62 for the outliers .",
    "the correlation coefficient of the main population is marginally improved when we exclude the outliers .",
    "the outliers also have a certain degree of the correlation .",
    "the power - law best - fit parameters for those two populations are found as follows ,    @xmath71    for the main population , the best - fit parameter of the power - law fit does not change significantly from that we derived from the entire data .",
    "we find that the power - law model is still valid for this relation .",
    "furthermore , this sparation also led to a very interesting result . from figure [ epoverliso045 ] , we can see that all of these outliers correspond to the rising phase of both initial weak peak and the second and third intense pulses .",
    "this indicates that if we exclude the initial rising phase of each pulse , we obtain much tighter @xmath72@xmath18 correlation for all grb .",
    "therefore , it is probably more appropriate to exclude initial rising phase of each pulse when we use this relation as the redshift indicator like time - averaged @xmath9 ",
    "@xmath14 ( yonetoku ) relation .",
    "moreover , it is likely that these outliers , in other words initial rising phase of each pulse have a different correlation with higher normalization and possibly smaller power - law index .",
    "however , we can not give a strong conclusion for this because this power - law index varies , strongly depending on the criteria between the main population and outliers .",
    "furthermore , we can not constrain the power - law index of outliers due to the small number of data . therefore , the robust conclusion is that the initial rising phase of burst have a different @xmath68 correlation with higher @xmath55 value from that of decay phase of burst .",
    "note that this argumentation do not form a circular logic because the main point of this study is not to improve the fit of @xmath68 correlation by removing the outliers but to just find that these outliers correspond to the initial phase of each pulse . this kind of trend that the initial phase of long grbs has harder spectrum than that of decay phase is already reported by @xcite .",
    "however , the wam data revealed that this harder - rising phase of long grbs also follow the another power - law relation with that of softer - decay phase .",
    "this difference between these different phases affects mainly the normalization of the relation .",
    "this fact can be useful to constrain the emission mechanism or dynamics of the emission site of the prompt emission of grbs .",
    "let us consider theoretical implications of our results that the spectral peak energy @xmath30 evolves from hard to soft in the rising phase of each pulse .",
    "although the emission mechanism of prompt grbs is still enigmatic , the leading models are ( 1 ) the synchrotron shock model @xcite and ( 2 ) the photosphere model @xcite .    in the synchrotron shock model ,",
    "the peak energy is identified with the typical synchrotron energy @xmath73 of electrons that are shocked in the relativistic outflow with a lorentz factor @xmath74 .",
    "assuming that a fraction @xmath75 of total energy goes into the electron acceleration and a fraction @xmath76 goes into the magnetic amplification , we have the typical lorentz factor of electrons as @xmath77 and the magnetic luminosity as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the shock radius and @xmath80 is the total luminosity .",
    "since almost all electron energy is radiated , the photon luminosity is given by @xmath81 .",
    "combining these relations , we have the peak energy as a function of @xmath79 , @xmath74 and @xmath82 as @xmath83    where @xmath84 in the cgs unit . in this model",
    ", the low energy photon index should not exceed @xmath54 , and even @xmath85 if electrons cool fast as expected in grbs @xcite . however , many previous observations found flatter low energy index than @xmath54 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since our results for grb 061007 exhibit flatter low energy photon index than @xmath54 for the spectrum of one time interval , the photosphere model should also be considered .    in the photosphere model ,",
    "the peak energy is identified with the thermal peak @xmath86 of the photosphere under which the outflow energy is internally dissipated and thermalized .",
    "most opacity of the photosphere is provided by @xmath87 pairs or electrons associated with baryons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this model has several advantages that the peak energy is stabilized even for high radiative efficiency and that the low energy photon index can be as hard as the thermal one , @xmath88 @xcite . with the stefan - boltzmann formula",
    ", we have the comoving energy density of photons as @xmath89 , so that @xmath90    from equations ( [ eq : epsyn ] ) and ( [ eq : epphoto ] ) , the high peak energy above the yonetoku relation @xmath91 suggests that the shock radius @xmath79 is small and/or the lorentz factor @xmath74 is large .",
    "this means that the fireball is expanding and/or decelerating in the initial rising of pulses , and we could be directly observing the fireball dynamics through the evolution of the yonetoku relation . since the shift of the peak energy is about a factor of two , the radius increases by a factor of @xmath92-@xmath93 and/or the lorentz factor decreases by a factor of @xmath94 . because the time dependence could be different between the synchrotron shock model @xmath95 and the photosphere model @xmath96",
    ", we could potentially discriminate models with similar but more detail spectral observations .",

    "in this section , we present the detail of the verification processes to check whether these outliers in the figure 8 are real or not from the point of view of the spectral analysis . at first , we compare the spectral shape of these outliers with that of main population as shown in figure [ systematic_spec ] left . for this comparison",
    ", we produce two integrated spectra . one of them is the spectrum of outliers which are summed up among all 8 data points which we defined as the outliers , and the other is the spectrum of the main population which is the summed up 9 data points with similar luminosity as the outliers .",
    "these selected data points are shown in the same figure . from this comparison , we find that the spectral shape of outliers is surely different from that of main population , and thus we confirm that these outliers do not simply arise from the uncertainty of the fitting procedures .",
    "then , we investigate another possibility that the lack of time resolution of the wam - trn data causes the behavior that the pulse rising phase tends to have higher @xmath3 value .",
    "we can only resolve with 1-sec time scale by the wam data even if the hard - to - soft spectral evolution exists with finer time scale .",
    "the @xmath3 value might be shifted if we average the spectrum out with 1-sec time scale which have that hard - to - soft evolution . in order to confirm this",
    ", we performed a monte carlo simulation to reproduce the spectra with hard - to - soft evolution . in this simulation , we assume that the @xmath3 and the luminosity of each spectrum change , following @xmath97 , as in the yonetoku relation , to represent the spectral evolution . we then investigate the differences of the @xmath3 value between each spectrum and that of averaged spectrum . as a result , we find that if we average the spectra with hard - to - soft evolution , the @xmath3 value becomes somewhat higher than than of each simulated spectrum , by about a factor of 1.3 .",
    "however , for the case of grb 061007 , the difference of the @xmath98 value between the outliers and the main population is much larger than this effect , which is about a factor of 2 , and we can not explain the behavior of the outliers only by this spectral evolution effect .",
    "next , we estimate the systematic uncertainties of these time - resolved spectral parameters",
    ". there are three major systematic uncertainties for the wam data .",
    "the first one is the uncertainty of the detector response matrix .",
    "however we already confirm that this uncertainty should be within 20% from the result of time - averaged spectral analysis .",
    "moreover , since we compare each time - resolved spectrum of only one burst , the uncertainties of response matrix do not influence our time - resolved analysis .",
    "the second issue is the dependence on the burst intensity . to investigate this uncertainty ,",
    "we calculate various types of spectra with same spectral parameters and different intensities by monte carlo simulation .",
    "figure [ systematic ] left shows the variation of the spectral parameters as a function of the burst intensity obtained by these simulated spectra , and we find that the @xmath30 goes to a lower value as the burst intensity goes down .",
    "however , this variation should be within only 20% and this tendency is inconsistent with that of outliers of our time - resolved spectra , i.e. the @xmath3 value of outliers becomes larger than major population .",
    "the third uncertainty is the variability of the background .",
    "figure [ systematic ] , right panel , shows a comparison of the background spectra between pre- and post - burst time intervals , and we find that the background spectrum only varies by less than 5% .",
    "we find that the @xmath30 value changes only 10% at maximum even when we use the background larger by 5% .",
    "this amount of variation can not explain the differences of the @xmath3 between the main population and the outliers of about a factor of 2 . from these estimation of the systematic effects of our time - resolved spectral analysis , we conclude that the differences of the main population and outliers can not be explained by the systematic uncertainties and this different population is real for this burst .",
