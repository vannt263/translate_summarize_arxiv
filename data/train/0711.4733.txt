    "the classical wave version uses only superposition , which is much more stable , and hence it is straightforward to design demonstration models @xcite . in the following ,",
    "i describe implementation of grover s algorithm in a simple mechanical setting , using four harmonic oscillators coupled via the centre - of - mass mode .",
    "a system of coupled harmonic oscillators is frequently studied in physics .",
    "it involves only quadratic forms , and can be solved exactly in both classical and quantum domains .",
    "let the items in the database be represented by @xmath0 identical harmonic oscillators . while they are oscillating in a specific manner , one of them is  tapped \" ( i.e. elastically reflected ) .",
    "the task is to identify which of the oscillators has been tapped , without looking at the tapping .",
    "the optimisation criterion is to design the system of oscillators , and their initial state , so as to make the identification as quickly as possible .",
    "= 9truecm    grover s algorithm requires identical coupling between any pair of oscillators .",
    "that is arranged by coupling all the @xmath0 small oscillators to a big oscillator , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "the big oscillator then is coupled to the centre - of - mass mode , and becomes an intermediary between any pair of oscillators with the same coupling .",
    "indeed , the centre - of - mass mode plays the role of the  average state \" . in this",
    "setting , elastic reflection of an oscillator implements the binary oracle in velocity space ( see fig.3 ) , and time evolution of the whole system by half an oscillation period carries out the reflection about average operation .",
    "the equations of motion are : @xmath18 the non - target ( @xmath19 ) oscillators influence the dynamics of the target oscillator ( @xmath20 ) only through the centre - of - mass position @xmath21 .",
    "they make up @xmath22 linearly independent modes , of the form @xmath23 , which decouple from @xmath20 and @xmath24 .",
    "effective dynamics is thus in the 3-variable space @xmath25 , with the equations of motion : @xmath26 the last equation is easily solved , with the angular frequency @xmath27 .",
    "the first two equations are coupled , and their eigenmodes are of the form @xmath28 .",
    "we can find them by requiring that @xmath29 therefore , @xmath30 let the dimensionless ratios for the spring constants and the masses be , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . then the sinusoidal solutions have the angular frequency @xmath33 there are two solutions to these equations , coefficients @xmath34 and the corresponding frequencies @xmath35 .",
    "they satisfy @xmath36 the general solution to the dynamical equations is : @xmath37    = 9truecm      we constructed the simplest system , with @xmath14 .",
    "the binary oracle ( i.e. @xmath9 ) is the elastic reflection @xmath38 when @xmath39 .",
    "the reflection about average operation imposes the constraint that the whole system must evolve by half an oscillation period between successive oracles . from the many possibilities , as our design parameters ,",
    "we selected the convenient frequency ratios @xmath40 then the time period @xmath41 for the whole system . time evolution for half the period reverses @xmath42 , while leaving @xmath43 unchanged , i.e. it implements the operator @xmath44 in the velocity space . thus grover s algorithm is realised by  tapping \" the target oscillator at every time interval @xmath45 .",
    "the above resonance criterion corresponds to : @xmath46 in a situation where all the non - target oscillators move uniformly together ( i.e. all @xmath19 equal , all @xmath47 equal ) , the displacements are @xmath48 our experimental parameters differed slightly from these ideal values because of various imperfections discussed later .",
    "the uniform superposition state corresponds to the initial conditions : @xmath49 in this case , the big oscillator returns to its initial rest state after every half a period , and the first binary oracle is applied at @xmath50 .",
    "the starting phases of the solution vanish , @xmath51 .",
    "the amplitudes are @xmath52 before the binary oracle , and @xmath53 after the binary oracle .",
    "the resultant time evolution of the oscillators in the position and velocity spaces is illustrated in fig.4 .",
    "it is observed that grover s algorithm provides position amplification of @xmath54 and velocity amplification of @xmath55 .",
    "[ t ] = 9truecm    = 9truecm    in actual experiment , it is much easier to start with the initial conditions : @xmath56 in this case , the velocities reach their maximum value after a quarter period , and the first binary oracle is applied at @xmath57 .",
    "the starting phases of the solution are , @xmath58 .",
    "the amplitudes are @xmath59 before the binary oracle , and @xmath60 after the binary oracle . the resultant time evolution ( as a function of @xmath61 ) of the oscillators in the position and velocity spaces is illustrated in fig.5 .",
    "it is found that grover s algorithm provides position amplification of @xmath62 and velocity amplification of @xmath55 .    in both these cases ,",
    "maximal velocity amplification is achieved .",
    "on the other hand , position amplification is substantial but not maximal .",
    "the reason is that the binary oracle is implemented in the velocity space , and it is physically not possible to implement it in the position space .",
    "= 9truecm    = 9truecm      _ gravity : _ a uniform gravitational field shifts the equilibrium positions of the vertically hanging springs , but apart from that it has no effect on their dynamics .",
    "this is obvious from the expression for the potential energy , @xmath63    _ imperfect synchronization of the initial state : _ when the initial velocities are arbitrary instead of uniform , the energy amplification of the target oscillator provided by the algorithm is not four - fold .",
    "it is instead limited to the initial energy present in the @xmath64 modes , @xmath65_{t=0 } ~ , \\label{maxgain}\\ ] ] which is still substantial for the generic situation where the initial @xmath66 and @xmath67 do not differ by a large amount .    _ imprecise reflection operations : _ in practice , the reflection operations may not exactly implement phase changes of @xmath15 .",
    "also , the measurement operation terminating the algorithm may not take place at the precise instant of maximum amplification .",
    "the energy amplification depends only quadratically on such phase errors from the ideal values , e.g. if the reflection phase change is @xmath68 , then the loss in energy amplification is @xmath69 .    _",
    "inelastic reflections : _ when the binary oracle produces an inelastic reflection of the target oscillator , with a coefficient of restitution @xmath70 ( i.e. @xmath71 ) , the energy amplification decreases by the factor @xmath72 . even in the extreme case of @xmath73 ,",
    "the energy amplification is a sizeable @xmath74-fold .",
    "_ spring masses : _ real springs are not massless .",
    "to a good approximation , the energy taken up by the springs can be estimated by assuming a constant velocity gradient along the springs , and then absorbing the spring energy by altering the masses of the objects attached to the springs .",
    "the dominant correction is to add one - third of the spring mass to the objects at either end .",
    "the remainder , in our set up and on the average , amounts to adding one - twelfth of the mass of the small springs to the big mass .",
    "this prescription allows tuning of the masses of the oscillators after measuring the masses of the springs , in order to maximise the energy amplification .",
    "_ damping : _ for a weakly damped oscillator ( damping force @xmath75 ) , its amplitude changes linearly with the damping coefficient @xmath76 , while its frequency changes quadratically @xcite .",
    "@xmath77 thus small external disturbances reduce the energy amplification , by a factor @xmath78 , but have little effect on the all important phase coherence amongst the oscillators that governs interference of the modes .",
    "overall , we find that most deviations of the parameters from their ideal values affect the performance of the algorithm only quadratically , and can be easily taken care of .",
    "damping provides the only linear perturbation , which should be controlled to the best possible extent .",
    "a variety of coupled vibrational systems with small damping can be made easily .",
    "they can provide either fast focusing or fast dispersal of energy , and can therefore be an important component in processes sensitive to energy availability .",
    "efficient concentration of the total energy of a coupled oscillator system into a specific oscillator can be used as a trigger or a sensor , where an external disturbance becomes the cause for the reflection oracle .",
    "the focusing of energy could also be useful in nanomechanical systems @xcite where the component concerned can not be directly controlled , and a possibility of using coupled cantilever beams as a switch is pointed out in fig.6 .",
    "there exist many processes that need crossing of an energy threshold for completion .",
    "their rates are typically governed by the boltzmann factor for the energy barrier , @xmath79 .",
    "energy amplification can speed up the rates of such processes by large factors , leading to catalysis @xcite .",
    "grover s algorithm is fully reversible .",
    "the reflection operators @xmath44 and @xmath9 are inverses of themselves .",
    "so the algorithm can be run backwards as @xmath80 . that disperses large initial energy in the target oscillator to a uniform distribution among its partners . in the coupled oscillator model , the initial condition would be @xmath81 and @xmath82 . after waiting for @xmath83 , and then reversing @xmath66 produces @xmath84 .",
    "this behaviour can be useful in quickly reducing localised perturbations by redistributing its energy throughout the system . instead of damping a single perturbed oscillator ,",
    "it is much more efficient to disperse the energy into several oscillators while damping all of them together . to illustrate the concept ,",
    "consider the situation where all the oscillators have the same damping coefficient @xmath76 .",
    "the normal modes in the @xmath25 space then separate the same way as in eq.(10 ) , and the relations in eqs.(12,13 ) are retained .",
    "damping shifts the oscillation frequencies according to @xmath85 , and the general solution becomes : @xmath86 the coupled oscillator dynamics of grover s algorithm is maintained by keeping the frequency ratios unchanged , @xmath87 if the initial conditions are chosen as @xmath88 then after half an oscillation period , @xmath89 , @xmath90 this results show that the distribution of energy among the coupled oscillators suppresses the energy of the target oscillator by an extra factor of 4 , in addition to the usual damping factor for a stand - alone oscillator .",
    "it is indeed the maximum possible reduction in energy , combining both the mechanisms .        with this choice , in time @xmath92 ,",
    "the energy of the target oscillator is reduced to @xmath93 of its initial value .",
    "although the energy loss is more compared to a stand - alone oscillator , it is less localized because it is distributed among the target oscillator , its partners and the big oscillator .",
    "the corresponding spring constant and mass ratios are : @xmath94    a hierarchical system of coupled oscillators ( see fig.7 ) can be even more efficient in dispersal of energy , by implementing the above mechanism simultaneously at multiple scales .",
    "the simplest choice would be to couple four small oscillators to a big one at every level , with appropriate mass , spring and damping parameters .",
    "it is also possible to combine dispersal and concentration operations to to transfer energy from one oscillator to another via the centre - of - mass mode .",
    "for example , in case of four coupled oscillators , initial energy in oscillator @xmath95 can be transferred to oscillator @xmath96 by @xmath97 in this manner , a local signal received by a large detector can be first dispersed over the whole system and then extracted at a specific location ."
