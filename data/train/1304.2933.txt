    "due to its unique properties , topological insulators ( ti ) @xcite are likely to play a major role as a component material in different types of heterostructures . for instance , with a view towards spintronics applications,@xcite heterostructures involving ferromagnetic ( fm ) materials or magnetic impurities have been studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally.@xcite underlying the many applications of magnetic heterostructures involving tis is the so - called axion electrodynamics,@xcite which was shown to distinguish the electromagnetic response of tis from ordinary insulators in an essential way.@xcite quite generally , it was shown in ref . that the lagrangian describing the electromagnetic response of _ all _ three - dimensional insulators is given by , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is in general a scalar field , the so - called axion,@xcite and @xmath7 is the fine - structure constant . in ordinary insulators",
    "@xmath6 vanishes , but this is not the case in tis.@xcite in its simplest variant the axion field is uniform and assumes the value @xmath8 for a bulk time - reversal ( tr ) invariant ti.@xcite for uniform @xmath6 the axion term becomes a surface term , leaving therefore the maxwell equations unaffected.@xcite despite being a surface term when @xmath6 is uniform , the axion term still plays an important role in finite samples .",
    "indeed , if we imagine a semi - infinite ti sample extending over @xmath9 up to the surface @xmath10 , we can use a covariant formalism to obtain , @xmath11 with the latin indices running over four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "application of gauss theorem yields , @xmath12 where the greek indices run over @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the above axion action at the surface actually represents a chern - simons ( cs ) term.@xcite as the chern - simons term does not depend on the metric , _",
    "i.e. _ on the geometry of the sample , its presence can be considered as a manifestation of the topological insulator .",
    "when some symmetry breaking is induced on the topological surface , the axion term may cause significant modifications on the dynamics of order parameters .",
    "for example , if the ti is in contact with a fm material and a proximity - induced magnetization arises on the topological surface , the magnetization dynamics is modified @xcite due to the so - called topological magnetoelectric ( tme ) effect,@xcite consisting of an electric field - induced magnetization caused by the quantum spin - hall effect . although the axion term with @xmath6 uniform does not modify the maxwell equation , it does modify the landau - lifshitz equation for the magnetization precession on the topological surface .",
    "@xcite    there are also situations where a non - uniform @xmath6 is relevant , like for example in the case of magnetic fluctuations coupled to the electromagnetic field.@xcite another example is when two topological surfaces of the material are gapped and an external magnetic field induces multichannel edge states.@xcite also in effective theories of topological superconductors a dynamical axion field plays an important role.@xcite in all these cases the maxwell equations are modified as well and in addition a dynamical field equation for the axion arises .    in order to generate an electromagnetic response featuring an axion term , the helical states have to gap .",
    "this may be achieved by an out - of - plane exchange field which may be induced by proximity effect .",
    "this means that the dirac fermions on the ti surface become massive and integrating them out generates a cs term , eq .",
    "( [ eq : axion - cs ] ) , having @xmath8.@xcite thus , in this case tr and parity symmetries are broken on the ti surface , but are still preserved in the bulk.@xcite to understand why the mass term breaks the tr and parity symmetries , observe that the qed - like theory emerging from the proximity - induced ferromagnetism on the surface of three - dimensional ti ( see sect .",
    "ii ) features two - component dirac fermions and , for this reason , does not have a chiral symmetry , since @xmath16-like matrices can only be defined for representations featuring four - component spinors.@xcite indeed , for @xmath17 @xmath18-matrices it is not possible to find an additional matrix that anticommutes with all of them .",
    "hence , the massless case corresponding to the case of in - plane magnetization has no _ internal _ symmetry that would prevent the addition of a mass term . on the other hand , a mass term breaks discrete spacetime symmetries .",
    "this case corresponds to an out - of - plane magnetization , which indeed is associated to mass term that breaks parity and tr symmetries . in particular , in 2 + 1 dimensions parity is realized in terms of a reflection ( mirror symmetry ) , for example , @xmath19 . note that inversion of both @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "does not work , since this is equivalent to a rotation by @xmath22 . in this case",
    "the dirac fermions transform under parity like @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the mass term is therefore not invariant under parity.@xcite in addition , the tr symmetry , defined by @xmath26 , @xmath27,@xcite is also broken once the mass term is introduced .",
    "this breaking of parity and tr symmetries by massive two - component dirac fermions causes a chern - simons ( cs ) term @xcite to be generated upon integrating them out .",
    "this generation of a cs term is related to the tme effect if these dirac fermions in 2 + 1 dimensions are viewed as surface states of a three - dimensional ti.@xcite it has been shown recently that the generation of the cs term by fermionic quantum fluctuations significantly affects the magnetization dynamics.@xcite    however , when only in - plane exchange is present , the dirac fermions on the ti surface remain massless , thus not violating tr or parity .",
    "consequently , in this case a cs term is not expected to be generated on the ti surface . an interesting question to be asked is whether masses for the dirac fermions simultaneously with the cs term can be spontaneously generated by some symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "we recall that there are several examples of _ dynamical _ mass generation in qed in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite and related theories , including some condensed matter models for graphene @xcite where the coulomb interaction is taken into account,@xcite and theories for the pseudogap in high-@xmath28 ( cuprate ) superconductors.@xcite however , the latter theories feature an even number of dirac cones , allowing the use of four - component dirac spinors .",
    "therefore , they have a chiral symmetry,@xcite since in this case two @xmath16-like matrices anticommuting with all @xmath18-matrices can be defined ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : seff - o - o - p ] ) , and this is simply not possible with an odd number of dirac cones arising in tis.@xcite thus , in none of the mentioned models a cs term can be generated when masses for the dirac fermions are dynamically generated .    in this paper",
    "we analyze what happens for an interacting ti having an odd number of dirac fermions in the proximity to a fm inducing an in - plane exchange . in particular , we show that in the presence of a screened coulomb interaction , a mass for the dirac fermions is dynamically generated only if the interaction strength exceeds some critical value . under the same conditions a cs term",
    "is also generated . as a result , the dynamical generation of the mass due to screened coulomb interaction in the case of ti in proximity to in - plane fm yields a tme effect similar to the case of an out - of - plane magnetization . in agreement with earlier calculations in the context of qed,@xcite",
    "we also show that for an even number of dirac fermions there is mass generation , but parity and tr are overall preserved and no cs term arises .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we define the qed - like model used in this paper and discuss its effective action in sects .",
    "[ sec : seff - o - o - p ] and [ sect : seff - i - p ] .",
    "[ sec : dynmass ] contains the main results , i.e. , the solution of the gap equation , showing that a semi - metal insulator transition occurs for a large enough value of the coupling constant .",
    "[ sect : discussion ] discuses the relation of our results to recent experiments and in sect .",
    "[ sect : conclusion ] we present the conclusions of this work .",
    "three appendices contain additional technical information about the calculations .",
    "in first - quantized form the hamiltonian for a topological surface with strong spin - orbit coupling in contact with a thin fm layer can be written in a form including a rashba - like term and an anisotropic exchange energy,@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fermi velocity , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the in - plane and out - of - plane exchange energies coupling to the magnetization @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "for an uniform magnetization , the hamiltonian is easily diagonalized , yielding the generally gapped energy spectrum , @xmath35 where @xmath36 . for a vanishing out - of - plane exchange we have a gapless spectrum with a dirac point at @xmath37 .",
    "thus , while for an out - of - plane magnetization the dirac spectrum is gapped , it is gapless in the case of in - plane exchange ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : precession ] .        in order to see",
    "whether for @xmath38 a mass can be dynamically generated , we have to consider the quantum fluctuations of the magnetization on the ti surface and , in addition , the coulomb interaction . if @xmath39^t$ ] , the schrdinger equation , @xmath40 , for a vanishing out - of - plane exchange in the absence of coulomb interaction reads , @xmath41 where @xmath42 plays the role of a vector potential .",
    "the above schrdinger equation has actually the form of a dirac equation in the presence of an electromagnetic field .",
    "thus , the lagrangian of the ti surface proximate to a fm thin film inducing a planar magnetization on it is given by , @xmath43\\psi,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the above lagrangian has a qed - like form in @xmath47 dimension with a vector potential @xmath42 , and no time component for the gauge field .",
    "a time component for the gauge field is introduced if we assume a screened coulomb interaction on the ti surface with interaction hamiltonian density @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 as usual .",
    "then , the full lagrangian acquires the following form @xmath51 which can be rewritten in terms of an auxiliary field , @xmath52 , via a hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation to obtain , @xmath53 where we have used the standard dirac slash notation , @xmath54 .",
    "note that the vector field @xmath55 is not dynamical at the lagrangian level , since the only quadratic term in the gauge field @xmath55 is a term proportional to @xmath56 with a time - independent coefficient .",
    "this term implies that the gauge symmetry is broken in the temporal direction .",
    "we are disregarding the long - range contribution to the coulomb interaction because it has been shown to be irrelevant in the long wavelength limit in theoretical studies of interacting graphene @xcite and a similar reasoning also applies here . from a model point of view",
    ", our lagrangian corresponds to a restricted thirring model,@xcite in the sense that only the zeroth component of the current @xmath57 appears squared in the interaction .    one important consequence of the term quadratic in @xmath52 ,",
    "is that @xmath0 does not renormalize .",
    "this follows from the gauge symmetry of the fermionic sector and can be easily proved using ward identities.@xcite an easy way of seeing this without making explicit use of the ward identity is to introduce renormalized fields @xmath58 and @xmath59 and observe that gauge invariance of the fermionic sector implies that the renormalized exchange coupling is @xmath60 , otherwise the form of the covariant derivative would not be preserved by a gauge transformation .",
    "furthermore , current conservation implies that any fluctuation correction for @xmath61 is transverse , and therefore terms quadratic in @xmath61 which are not gauge invariant do not renormalize , yielding @xmath62 and consequently @xmath63 . therefore , @xmath0 is a good tuning parameter in our theory .",
    "the fact that @xmath0 does not renormalize will be important in our subsequent analysis .",
    "note that our lagrangian does not include an intrinsic dynamics for the magnetization .",
    "although the fm above the ti surface has its own dynamics , we are assuming a minimal model on the topological surface where the only exchange interaction is the one between the electronic spin and the surface magnetization .",
    "thus , the whole magnetization dynamics on the topological surface will be generated by the quantum fluctuations of the dirac fermions .",
    "it is certainly important to include other exchange effects , like it was done in refs . and .",
    "however , our main aim here is to study the dynamical mass generation and the spontaneous breaking of parity and tr symmetries . for this purpose our minimal exchange model ( [ eq : ti - qed-1 ] ) already exhibits this feature and has the advantage of being analytically more tractable .",
    "let us first recall the situation for @xmath64 that is when the ferromagnet has the out - plane component of the magnetization . since we are assuming that the fm above the ti surface is in the broken symmetry state , we can write @xmath65 , where @xmath66 . which can be either positive or negative , and @xmath67 are small transverse fluctuations . in this case",
    "the lagrangian ( [ eq : ti - qed-1 ] ) becomes @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the mass term _ explicitly _ breaks parity and time - reversal symmetry .",
    "let us assume that we have @xmath2 dirac fermion species and work within an imaginary time formalism . in this case",
    "after integrating out the @xmath2 fermionic degrees of freedom , we obtain , @xmath70 now we expand the above effective action up to quadratic order in the vector field @xmath55 , which in momentum space reads , @xmath71,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the one - loop vacuum polarization , which is evaluated in detail in appendix [ app : vacpol ] .",

    "this result was used for the case where @xmath79 .",
    "we note also that the first ( maxwell ) term in eq .",
    "( [ cs - term ] ) contains a dimensionfull coefficient as it depends on @xmath80 .",
    "thus , this term is non - universal and receives corrections from all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the second term ( the cs term ) is universal and its prefactor @xmath81 is just a sign .",
    "moreover , being independent of the metric , it is not expected to be modified by the scale transformations , so it does not renormalize .",
    "the coleman - hill theorem @xcite on the non - renormalization of the cs term provides a more precise statement of this argument .",
    "observe that the number of dirac fermions , @xmath2 , must be necessarily odd , otherwise no cs term is generated .",
    "although this point was noticed before in ref .",
    "( see sect .",
    "iv - d there ) , we would like to revisit it in the framework of our calculations .",
    "in order to see the effect , let us now assume that each of the @xmath2 dirac fermions has a mass , @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the low - energy form of the cs term is now given by , @xmath84 now , if the number of dirac fermions is even , we can rewrite the dirac lagrangian in terms of @xmath85 four - component dirac fermions using @xmath86 @xmath18-matrices . in this case",
    "a mass term @xmath87 is invariant under both parity and time - reversal transformations , just like in the case of qed in four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "namely , when four - component dirac fermions are introduced in 2 + 1 dimensions , it is possible to introduce @xmath86 dirac matrices of the form,@xcite @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 are the pauli matrices . with the above representation",
    "the chiral symmetry can be defined via the following two matrices,@xcite @xmath93 anticommuting with all @xmath18-matrices ( [ eq : gamma ] ) , where @xmath94 is a @xmath17 identity matrix .",
    "the lagrangian for massless four - component dirac fermions has therefore the invariance under the chiral transformations @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "since under these transformations @xmath97 and @xmath98 , the current @xmath99 is invariant , but @xmath100 is not .",
    "thus , for massless qed in 2 + 1 dimensions with four - component dirac fermions the chiral symmetry prevents the addition of a mass term.@xcite indeed , a term @xmath101 in the lagrangian would explicitly break the chiral symmetry , but not parity and tr . in our particular case",
    "this implies that we must have @xmath102 in the representation where @xmath103 two - component dirac fermions are used , since this is equivalent to @xmath104 four - component dirac fermions .",
    "thus , the spectrum must consist of @xmath85 masses having the opposite sign of the remaining @xmath85 ones .",
    "we conclude that @xmath2 must be odd in order to generate a cs term , and we can write @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that a ti features an odd number of dirac fermions .",
    "therefore , the cs action originating from the coupling of dirac fermions to an out - of - plane exchange can be written in the form , @xmath107 which emphasizes the role of an odd number of dirac fermions .",
    "note that the apparent `` quantization '' of the cs coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs - action ] ) does not have in the present context the same origin as the hall conductivity in the quantum hall effect , as it arises from integrating out dirac fermions coupled to a vector field .",
    "however , it is consistent with the analysis of qi _",
    "et al._@xcite of the axion term , since we find here that the axion field has the constant value @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , for a single dirac fermion ( @xmath108 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs - action ] ) coincides with eq .",
    "( [ eq : axion - cs ] ) for this value of @xmath6 and identifying @xmath109 , so the in - plane exchange coupling squared plays the role of the fine - structure constant in this case .",
    "it is worth to mention in this context yet another aspect of the problem discussed recently in ref . , namely , the dependence of the hall conductivity at the edges of a finite sample for a general value of @xmath6 , not necessarily @xmath13 or @xmath22 .",
    "this case is relevant if there is an external magnetic field . in this situation",
    "it can be shown that the hall conductivity is given by @xmath110 $ ] [ in units where @xmath111 ; here we are assuming that the lowest value of @xmath104 is zero , just like in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs - action ] ) ] , and quantization will hold if @xmath6 changes by @xmath112 on loops containing @xmath113 edges channels.@xcite    it is important to emphasize here the difference between a non - abelian cs action , where the cs coupling is quantized due to the requirement of gauge - invariance,@xcite so that the integer arising there is actually a winding number .",
    "note that the derivation of the axion term in the bulk leads to an expression for @xmath6 given in terms of a non - abelian berry connection in momentum space , which is derived in terms of the actual band structure on the bulk.@xcite this is a topological invariant generalizing the thouless - kohmoto - nightingale - nijs invariant,@xcite which features a berry abelian curvature in momentum space , to higher dimensions . in our calculations done in the 2 + 1 dimensions",
    "@xmath6 is also quantized in the sense that it may have only two values , @xmath22 or 0 , where the latter refers to the absence of the cs term .",
    "rewriting the cs term in explicitly in terms of components allows us to analyze its physical content relative to the magnetization dynamics on the topological surface:@xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 yields the electric field associated to the screened coulomb potential and @xmath116 .",
    "we observed that the cs action contains an induced berry phase associated to the precession of the magnetization.@xcite if we neglect for a moment the contribution of the maxwell term in the effective action , we obtain simply , @xmath117 which is the expected result for a spin - hall response . in order to obtain the full magnetization precession",

    "the propagator ( [ eq : gauge - prop ] ) does not smoothly connect to the strongly coupled regime , @xmath128 .",
    "this is a typical behavior for massive vector fields @xcite which is also reflected here , although our vector field is only massive along the temporal direction .",
    "note , however , that in the strongly coupled regime our model reduces to a qed model in 2 + 1 dimensions with two - component dirac fermions .",

    "this means that in the ti / fm heterostructure with in - plane magnetization the dynamic mass generation will be proportional to the absolute value of the in - plane exchange coupling in the fm .",
    "this is interesting as it points towards experimental realizability of the observed effect by varying the fm substrate of the heterostructure .",
    "we note that the case of in - plane exchange coupling on a topological surface is highly nontrivial with respect to the case of out - of - plane exchange . indeed , in the case of an out - of - plane exchange a simple mean - field theory would generate a gap for arbitrarily small values of the coupling constant @xmath0 , and",
    "no semi - metal - insulator transition would take place in this case.@xcite this situation is reminiscent from the metal - insulator transition in the hubbard model , where a mean - field theory at half - filling yields a gap @xmath194 , where @xmath181 is the on - site coulomb interaction.@xcite it is well known that this result is not correct for values of @xmath181 smaller than energy scales of the order of the bandwidth.@xcite note , that on a ti surface the mean - field result also leads to a phase transition if a momentum dependence of the interaction induced by projecting the bulk hamiltonian on the edge states is taken into account but for some critical value @xmath195.@xcite in our case the out - of - plane exchange is generated dynamically from the interplay between quantum planar magnetic and charge fluctuations , which is characterized by a competition between the in - plane exchange coupling @xmath32 and the screened coulomb interaction @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to a dynamical mass generation accompanied by the generation of a cs term , which implies a coupling between the in - plane magnetization and the electric field @xmath115 , and to a berry phase governing the precession dynamics of the magnetization .",
    "note that the inclusion of the charged channel in the hubbard - stratonovich decoupling is crucial to obtain a cs term .",
    "the case of in - plane magnetization is of great experimental relevance . recently",
    "a thin film of fm insulator eus has been successfully grown on the surface of bi@xmath3se@xmath4,@xcite making the surface of bi@xmath3se@xmath4 ferromagnetic by proximity effect with magnetization at the interface being different from the bulk eus values .",
    "there were several features which point out towards a strong interaction between the magnetic moments of eus and bi@xmath3se@xmath4 .",
    "one of them refers to the fact that the dependence of the planar magnetoresistivity of the interface bi@xmath3se@xmath4 shows an effectively lower curie temperature than that of the bulk eus which could be the result of the quantum fluctuations due to presence of surface dirac fermions.@xcite another effect is even more interesting as it reports the significant out - of - plane magnetization of the magnetic moments at the fm - ti interface while the bulk eus has the in - plane orientation of the magnetic moments.@xcite our results show that the out of plane orientation of the moments will be indeed generated at the interface by the interaction among the dirac fermions although on the experimental side further mechanisms related to the crystalline anisotropy at the grown interface can be also in play .",
    "in addition , the direct gapping of the dirac spectrum of the surface electrons was reported very recently at the eus - bi@xmath3se@xmath4 interface.@xcite in particular , it was found that below curie temperature there is a negative megnetoresistance near zero field which is believed to be the consequence of gap opening in the dirac spectrum due to proximity to the ferromagnet with out - of - plane magnetization.@xcite according to our calculations this effect must be dependent on the temperature and on the strength of the out - plane component of the magnetization , induced by the interaction .",
    "this would be interesting to test experimentally .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that in topological insulators with a proximity - induced in - plane magnetization a gap can be spontaneously generated by tuning the local electronic interaction above a critical value , leading in this way to a semi - metal - insulator transition . in particular , considering the @xmath2 number of dirac fermions we find that when @xmath2 is even , the masses are generated in pairs @xmath196 and no cs term is generated , so that parity and time - reversal is overall preserved . on the other hand , for @xmath2 odd which",
    "the case of ti all generated masses are equal and positive and as a result , the cs term with tme effect is generated .",
    "in particular , we find that the critical dimensionless value of @xmath192 for generating this term is also proportional to the value of the in - plane exchange coupling of the fm making this effect to depend on the choice of the fm substrate in the experiment .    that no cs term is generated for @xmath2 even is physically reasonable , since in this case we can change to a representation where there are @xmath85 four - component dirac spinors , in which case the model may be reinterpreted as some model for graphene , a material featuring an even number of dirac cones .",
    "interestingly , in such a graphene model the gap generation is associated to a mass spectrum containing masses @xmath196 , a scenario not considered so far in interacting models for graphene where the `` vector field '' has only the time component as compared to qed.@xcite tis , on the other hand , have an odd number of dirac cones . in this context , recent experiments on eus / bi@xmath3se@xmath4 heterostructures open the possibility that the experimentally elusive gap generation in qed - like theories may finally be observed in the near future .",
