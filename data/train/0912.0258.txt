    "in terms of the quark model , one can observe a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the approximate @xmath9 symmetry , resulting in nine pseudo - goldstone bosons , that are usually associated with the light mesons formed as @xmath10 quark - antiquark bound states .",
    "this nave picture is , however , complicated by the fact that the @xmath1 meson has a large mass of the order of 1 @xmath11 .",
    "as early as 1970 , kobayashi and maskawa concluded that the large mass of the @xmath7meson ( formerly known as @xmath12 ) is a serious problem that is difficult to understand in a chiral @xmath9 model with an explicit symmetry breaking term between singlet and octet states  @xcite .",
    "they found that the existence of an effective six - quark determinantial vertex is necessary .",
    "as shown by t  hooft in 1976 , this vertex is contained in instanton - induced quark interactions  @xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect of this kobayashi - maskawa-t hooft or kmt term  @xcite is that it can give rise to a flavor mixing in the scalar as well as in the pseudoscalar channels .",
    "the coupling between the pseudoscalar singlet and octet states @xmath13 and @xmath14 arises both from the @xmath15 breaking and the anomaly terms , assuming isospin symmetry .",
    "the physical @xmath16 and @xmath7mesons are given by the mixing of the @xmath14 and @xmath13 modes , and the mass of the @xmath13 singlet state turns out to be sensitive to the strength of the kmt vertex .",
    "an explicit calculation for the general case gives the mixing angle @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath1 mesons change their masses as a function of the temperature @xmath18 , due to both the @xmath18 dependence of the quark condensate , and the possible decrease of the kmt coupling constant with increasing @xmath18 .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath19 also becomes @xmath18 dependent : as the temperature increases , mixing between @xmath16 and @xmath1 approximates the ideal one , and the @xmath13 component in the physical @xmath1 decreases . on the other hand , with increasing @xmath18 , the @xmath13 tends to play the role of the ninth nambu - goldstone boson of the @xmath20 symmetry , and loses its mass rapidly . at low temperatures , the @xmath21 part of the symmetry",
    "is broken by instantons , invoking distinct vacuum states .",
    "tunneling between these vacuum states is only possible `` at a cost '' , giving extra mass to the @xmath7meson .",
    "however , as the transition amplitude is dependent on the strong coupling constant @xmath22 , it follows that the effect of instantons rapidly decreases with increasing energy density .",
    "this is an effective restoration of the @xmath21 symmetry at finite @xmath18 , first suggested in ref .",
    "thus in high energy heavy ion collisions , where a hot and dense medium is created , the @xmath21 symmetry may temporarily be restored  @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite we reported the first observation of a significant reduction of the @xmath7mass , based on an analysis of phenix and star data  @xcite from @xmath23=200 gev central au+au collisions at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "the subject of the present manuscript is to detail and systematically explore these experimental signatures of a partial @xmath21 symmetry restoration at rhic .    in thermal models ,",
    "the production cross sections of the light mesons are exponentially suppressed by the mass .",
    "since the @xmath7mesons are heavy , by default one expects the number of @xmath7mesons to be about two orders of magnitude less than the number of pions .",
    "however , as a consequence of the mass reduction , this suppression would be moderated , and the @xmath1 mesons would show up in an enhanced number . once produced , the @xmath7is expected to be decoupled from other hadronic matter , since its annihilation cross section is very small . at the same time , the low-@xmath24@xmath7mesons are trapped in the medium due to energy conservation reasons , forming a condensate . due to expansion , the medium cools down and freezes out , emitting asymptotic particles that propagate in @xmath25 vacuum . by this time , the @xmath7mesons regain their original mass , hence the enhancement will mostly appear at low @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that the @xmath7lifetime is much longer than the lifetime of the hot and dense medium , therefore a direct observation of the mass shift seems to be extremely difficult .",
    "a promising channel of observation is the dileptonic decay @xmath26 , because a low-@xmath24@xmath7enhancement would give extra lepton pairs to the low invariant mass region .",
    "the paper of kapusta , kharzeev and mclerran on the return of the prodigal goldstone boson  @xcite was in fact motivated by the dilepton enhancement seen in cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) @xmath27 laboratory energies in s+pb reactions .",
    "recent interpretations of ceres  @xcite and na60 data  @xcite indicate that the approach to a chiral symmetry restored state could proceed through resonance broadening and eventually subsequent melting , rather than by dropping masses or mass dependency or mass degeneracy between chiral partners  @xcite .",
    "recent phenix findings also show a definite excess in the @xmath28 dielectron invariant mass region in @xmath5 au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "unlike at lower beam energies , in this case the contribution from a hot hadronic phase without mass shifts seems to be insufficient to account for the enhancement seen in the data  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we search for the @xmath7mass modification and the related restoration of the chiral symmetry in a different channel , using already published like - sign bose ",
    "einstein correlation ( bec ) measurements as proposed by ref .",
    "we report on a detailed systematic study of the presently available published data sets .",
    "future high precision data points in the low-@xmath24region will help to reduce the uncertainties of the measurements , and hopefully will provide a more precise estimation of the @xmath7mass reduction , compared to our current analysis .",

    "the widths of @xmath16 and @xmath7are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , corresponding to large decay times : they produce pions at @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which are huge compared to the characteristic hbt radii of 46 fm . among the decay channels of the @xmath7 ,",
    "the @xmath33 channel has the largest branching ratio of about 45% .",

    "halo picture , where the `` core '' consists of primordially created pions and those ones coming from fast - decaying resonances , while the other pions , coming from more slowly decaying resonances , make the `` halo '' @xcite .",
    "the core region is resolvable by bec , while the halo is not .",
    "in fact , the core  halo separation always depends on the experimental two - track resolution .",
    "for example in phenix and star , two tracks are separable with a momentum difference of @xmath42 larger than 4 to 5 mev , corresponding to a spatial separability @xmath43 that dies off at about 4050 fm  @xcite .",
    "long tails extending to this region were recently observed by the phenix and na49 collaborations at rhic and cern sps energies  @xcite .",
    "note that these long tails are also seen in kaon imaging , while the bulk production is well described with characteristic scales of 46 fm  @xcite .    in the core ",
    "halo picture  @xcite the correlation function can be measured with the so called extrapolated intercept parameter @xmath44as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is defined by the fourier transform of the one - pion emission function @xmath47 of the core as @xmath48 and the intercept parameter @xmath44 is derived from the _ extrapolation _ of the correlation value to @xmath49 , as @xmath50 . however , this extrapolation does not include the correlation between halo  halo and core  halo particle pairs , supposed to be unresolvable by our detectors .. generally , @xmath51 . ]    the intercept parameter can also be expressed directly with the fraction of the core pions to the total number of pions : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and it is per se sensitive to the core vs.  halo ratio .",

    "we will show that the phenomenon of a partial @xmath8 restoration and a connected mass reduction of the @xmath1 meson is able to explain the behavior of @xmath3 measured in rhic experiments . a previous analysis , based on the same idea ,",
    "was carried out on na44 data , and showed that a reduction of the @xmath71 mass should result in a dip of the @xmath72 at low-@xmath57 values .",
    "however , no significant signal of such a mass modification was seen in @xmath73 s+pb collisions at cern sps ( fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the sps data , a low-@xmath57dip of the @xmath72 was measured in @xmath74 au+au collisions at rhic by both the star and the phenix experiments  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath72 points were extracted from the measured correlation function of like - sign pions , using different methods .",
    "a comparison of the measurements to the fritiof  @xcite calculation including variation of the @xmath7mass was presented in fig .",
    "4 . of ref .",
    "it is important to note that , although the gaussian fit typically has 12% error on the @xmath75 value , this does not reflect the real error on the intercept caused by the extrapolation .",
    "for example , exponential fits yield larger values for @xmath75 than the gaussian fits do , and the difference between @xmath76 and @xmath77 is larger than several ( sometimes more than 5 ) standard deviations  @xcite .",
    "a reasonable range of errors can be estimated with the help of an edgeworth fit  @xcite . in the detailed presentation of ref .  @xcite it was suggested to utilize the normalized @xmath78quantity in order to remove sensitivity to the extrapolation technique , and to reduce other systematic errors .",
    "note that @xmath79 is defined as the value of the extrapolated intercept parameter in an @xmath80 region where its value is saturated ; according to simulations as well as the presently used phenix and star measurements , this corresponds to 0.5 gev @xmath81 0.7 gev region .",

    "] one should also note that the @xmath72 data may depend on the goodness of the particle identification too : other particles misidentified as pions will reduce correlation and will push the measured @xmath72 data down .",
    "the phenix @xmath72 data set was derived using the bowler - sinyukov method @xcite , while the star data set was obtained from a sixth order edgeworth fit .",

    "however , the error bars on @xmath3 are significantly larger than the nave errors on @xmath75 . as emphasized before , the edgeworth @xmath3 gives a more realistic estimation of both the value and the error of the intercept parameter , hence of the core - halo ratio .",
    "another data set on @xmath44from star was obtained with a gaussian fit using the bowler - sinyukov method , and it shows a good agreement with the star edgeworth data ( fig .  14 of @xcite ) .",
    "we do not use this data set in our analysis , since the error bars do not include all the relevant systematic effects , being in the order of @xmath85 , which is way smaller than the systematic error coming from the choice of the extrapolation .",

    "one can note that these two data sets are not in perfect overlap with each other , although they are consistent within their errors , and it is possible to fit both data sets simultaneously with good confidence levels .",
