    "m82 is a nearby edge - on galaxy ( d = 3.63 mpc , image scale 17.6  pcarcsec@xmath2 ; freedman et al . 1994 ) , which has revealed interesting phenomena at every spatial scale investigated ; on the largest scale , a bridge of intergalactic gas , spanning over 20  kpc , connects m82 with its neighbor m81 @xcite .",
    "the external part of the stellar disk ( radius@xmath35  kpc ) is warped in the direction of the hi streamers detected by @xcite .",
    "the central 500  pc of the galaxy harbors a starburst , the prototype for the starburst phenomenon @xcite .",
    "starburst - driven galactic superwinds were detected upto distances of 10  kpc above the plane of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "surrounding the active starburst region , there are a molecular ring of 400  pc radius @xcite , and a near - infrared ( nir ) bar of @xmath31  kpc length @xcite .",
    "a network of dusty filaments dominate the optical appearance of the galaxy .",
    "morphologically , m82 belongs to the irr ii class of galaxies @xcite , later called i0 by @xcite and `` amorphous '' by @xcite .",
    "m82 is a low mass galaxy ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) , with most of its mass concentrated within the central 2  kpc @xcite .",
    "there is overwhelming evidence that m82 has recently undergone close encounters with its massive neighbor m81 and the dwarf galaxy ngc3077 @xcite .",
    "detailed n - body simulations of interacting systems have shown that the onset of gaseous infall is intimately related to the formation of global bars and/or spiral arms ( i.e. @xmath0 mode ) , which help drive the gas towards the central regions @xcite .",
    "the presence of the nir bar in m82 is in agreement with this general picture .",
    "however , in m82 the bar occupies only one tenth of the optical disk , suggesting that there may be hidden components such as spiral arms extending over the entire disk .",
    "given the large amount of extinction in the optical bands , a careful analysis of nir images is needed to uncover such features .",
    "@xcite carried out nir surface photometry of m82 , and found distortions in the isophotes outside the central bar , which they assumed to be related to the warp of the external disk . in this _",
    "letter _ , using new deep nir images , we comprehensively show that these isophotal distortions in m82 are due to the presence of a two - armed logarithmic spiral structure .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the observations and the techniques adopted in their analysis . in section 3 and 4 , we characterize the properties of the disk and spiral arms .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we discuss the morphological type of m82 .",
    "new nir imaging of m82 in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands were obtained during 2004 march 30 and 31 , with the cananea near infrared camera ( canica ) available at the 2.1-m telescope of the observatorio astrofsico guillermo haro in cananea , sonora .",
    "canica hosts a @xmath8 format , hawaii array .",
    "the image scale and field of view of the camera are 0.32pixel@xmath2 and @xmath9@xmath105.5 , respectively .",
    "a sequence of object and sky images were taken , with the final co - added images corresponding to integration times on the object of 18 , 6 and 12.5 minutes in @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands , respectively .",
    "the fwhm of the seeing disk was @xmath32.5 .",
    "the galaxy slightly overfills the detector array , and the outermost isophotes in our images correspond to surface brightness levels of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13magarcsec@xmath14 in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands , respectively .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is in excess of 50 for the azimuthally averaged intensities .",
    "photometric standard stars from @xcite were observed to calibrate the images .",
    "the resulting magnitudes for the central 35  aperture agree within 0.05  mag with those extracted over the same aperture from the 2mass archival images .",
    "further information on the canica instrumentation and the reduction package can be found in @xcite .",
    "we complemented our nir data with @xmath15-band images @xcite , archived at the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "the optical appearance of m82 is dominated by bright star - forming knots interspersed by the dusty filaments . however , in the nir , the light distribution is smooth , rendering the images ideal for studying the properties of the stellar disk .",
    "@xcite analyzed nir images , and found variations of the position angle ( p.a . )",
    "of the semi - major axis and axial ratio @xmath16 , as a function of radius . in cases like this ,",
    "the determination of the inclination of the disk to the line of sight is highly uncertain .",
    "hence @xcite have suggested the use of a characteristic @xmath16 value jointly with an intrinsic ratio for the scaleheight to scalelength of 0.20 .",
    "the range of the observed @xmath16 ratios provides an estimator of error for the inclination angle . for m82",
    ", we determine a characteristic @xmath17 , corresponding to an inclination angle of @xmath18 .",
    "the surface photometry was carried out with the ellipse task in iraf / stsdas .",
    "we obtained one - dimensional ( 1-d ) intensity profiles in @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands by azimuthally averaging the intensities in successive annular regions .",
    "the 1-d intensity profiles in the outer parts of the galaxy follow an exponential law as expected for a stellar disk .",
    "a fit to the @xmath7-band profile outside a radius of 60  yields a scalelength of @xmath19(@xmath20  pc ) , in good agreement with the values obtained by @xcite .",
    "the error on the scalelength was estimated by fitting an exponential function to different 1-d profiles , each profile obtained by varying @xmath16 between 0.280.32 , and p.a . between 6265@xmath21 .",
    "the scalelengths in the @xmath22 and @xmath23-bands are identical to that in the @xmath7-band within the quoted errors .",
    "an image of the m82 disk was constructed from the exponential scalelength and the ellipse - fitting parameters .",
    "this was subtracted from the observed @xmath24-band images in order to obtain three residual images .",
    "non - axisymmetric structures such as a bar and spiral arms are expected to stand out on these images .",
    "a combined image of these residual images is displayed in figure  1a .",
    "the most prominent component in this image is a bright linear structure of 120  length centered around the nucleus , which then extends as arcs out to a radius of @xmath3160 .",
    "the bar discovered by @xcite occupies only the central 60 .",
    "the rest of the linear structure , along with the arcs represent spiral arm structure viewed almost edge - on , as we demonstrate below .",
    "the @xmath7-band residual image contours are superposed on a @xmath15-band image in figure  1b .",
    "note that the spiral arms are not seen directly in @xmath15-band . however , all the bright blue knots lie along our spiral arms .    a most common technique adopted to characterize the properties of the spiral arms is to analyze the azimuthal intensity profiles on deprojected images using fourier analysis . for galaxies with large inclinations ,",
    "as is the case for m82 , the face - on view of the galaxy can not be recovered by deprojection .",
    "hence , we followed an alternative approach of projecting models of spiral galaxies to the inferred inclination angle for m82 , and comparing the azimuthal profiles of these images with those in the @xmath7-band . a face - on model of m82",
    "is constructed by adding the light of an @xmath0 spiral mode of a given pitch angle to that of an exponential disk .",
    "details of this model are given in section .",
    "the observed azimuthal profiles are compared with model profiles in figure  2a , where azimuthal profiles for radii in the 40  to 160  range are plotted .",
    "the largest plotted radius corresponds to 3.4 times the disk scalelength .",
    "the north - eastern and south - western arms are easily noticeable at p.a.s 65@xmath25 and 245@xmath25 , respectively .",
    "as expected for a logarithmic spiral , the azimuthal angles of the arms vary systematically with radius . in our case ,",
    "the azimuthal angle turns over at @xmath2680   radius .",
    "the plotted profiles for the @xmath0 model illustrate that this dependence can be traced even in highly inclined systems .",
    "the observed azimuthal profiles at various radii are very well reproduced by a two - armed spiral mode with a 14@xmath25 pitch angle .",
    "the azimuthal profiles are also useful in quantifying the spiral arm contrasts . in the @xmath7-band ,",
    "the arms are brighter by about @xmath27 magnitudes with respect to the inter - arm regions . corresponding value for the @xmath15-band is @xmath28mag .",
    "these values translate to contrast parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 , following the @xcite definition , i.e. @xmath31 .",
    "these quantities in m82 are a factor of four lower than those observed for the grand design spiral m51 .",
    "the azimuthal profiles of @xmath32 and @xmath33 colors are plotted in figure  2b .",
    "the arms show up as the bluest regions , especially in the @xmath33 color .",
    "the south - western arm is bluer by 1.0  mag in @xmath33 and 0.2  mag in @xmath32 color .",
    "we also find that the location of the largest disk structures detected in near ultraviolet ( 2500 ) images @xcite , coincide with the location of the spiral arms . on the left side of the south - western arm , the @xmath33 color increases very sharply .",
    "this is due to the dust lane present on the concave side of the arm ( seen also in figure  1b ) .",
    "the azimuth range 65245 corresponds to the dustier part of the galaxy , also affected by the superwind cone .",
    "why were the spiral arms in m82 overlooked in previous studies in spite of the galaxy s high surface brightness and proximity ? the factors that play against an easy detection are the ( i ) high inclination angle of the disk , ( ii ) large optical obscuration , and ( iii ) low contrast for the spiral arms .",
    "this combination prevents the detection of the spiral structures even after the advent of nir detectors .",
    "we now investigate the possible nature of the newly discovered arms .",
    "are they trailing in nature as in the majority of galaxies ( e.g. , de vaucouleurs , 1958 ) ?",
    "do they emerge from the tips of the bar ?    in order to answer these questions , we constructed a model galaxy by adding the light of all relevant sub - components known to exist in m82 .",
    "the model spiral galaxy contains three main components : an exponential disk , an @xmath0 mode spiral and a bar .",
    "the 60-length bar is tilted with respect to the galaxy major axis by 4@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we have adopted such a configuration in our model . a fourth component , a starburst nucleus , modeled as a de vaucouleurs profile of effective radius 15 , was also added .",
    "the assumed intensity profiles of the bar and the starburst nucleus , do not affect our azimuthal profiles , since we limit our analysis to radii larger than the bar length .",
    "however , the inclusion of the bar in our model helps us to investigate the question of whether or not the spiral arms emanate from their tips .",
    "the spiral arms are chosen to be logarithmic in nature , and are generated for radii @xmath3430 .",
    "the intensity along the arms follows the same exponential law of the disk and hence the contrast of the arms remains constant all along them .",
    "different model galaxies were generated by varying the pitch angle , the initial phase , and the contrast of the spiral arms .",
    "the parameters of the model that best reproduce the observed @xmath7-band azimuthal intensity profile ( i.e. both the observed radius - azimuth and radius - contrast relation for the arms ) are chosen as the final ones .",
    "the plots for the model in figure  2a correspond to the best - fit case , whose parameters are listed in table  1 , along with the observed values and errors on them .",
    "the error assigned to model parameters indicate the range over which acceptable fits can be obtained .",
    "lll inclination [ @xmath25 ] & 77@xmath36 & 76@xmath37 + major axis p.a .",
    "[ @xmath25 ] & 6265 & 64@xmath37 + disk scalelength [ ] & 47@xmath36 & 48 + @xmath38(0 ) [ magarcsec@xmath14 ] & 14.1 & 15.5 + bar length [ ] & 60 & 60 + spiral ( @xmath0 ) & & trailing , logarithmic + & & pitch angle=14@xmath40 + contrast @xmath41 & @xmath42 & 1.20 +    the face - on , and projected views of the best - matched model galaxy , after subtracting the exponential disk , are displayed in figure  3 .",
    "it can be seen that the spiral arms emerge from the ends of the bar between the tips of the bar and the beginning of the arms .",
    "however , the arms can be connected to the tips of the bar by allowing the pitch angle to vary smoothly along the arms from 13@xmath25 in the inner part to 15@xmath25 at radius=160 . ] , as is commonly observed in barred galaxies .",
    "arms wind @xmath43 before they can be noticed as such on the residual image at @xmath380  radius . on the projected image ,",
    "the arms are almost straight features in the 3060  radial zone , appearing as an extention of the bar .",
    "the spiral arms are not noticeable unless an exponential disk is subtracted .    the expected sense of rotation of stars in trailing spiral arms is indicated in figure  3 .",
    "the observed geometrical and kinematical orientations of the galaxy are also shown .",
    "these are based on the scheme adopted by @xcite .",
    "this configuration is consistent with the spiral arms being trailing in nature .",
    "the presence of a dust lane on the concave side of the south - western arm also supports the trailing nature of the arms . besides , the molecular gas distribution in the disk closely follows this dust lane @xcite .",
    "further out , the molecular gas warps , connecting smoothly with the off - planar hi streamers reported by @xcite .",
    "the joint configuration of the bar , spiral arms , molecular gas , and hi streamers suggest that they are part of a global @xmath0 mode excited by a close encounter of m82 with its neighbors m81 and ngc3077 .",
    "the bi - symmetric structure might be facilitating the infall of gas from the debris surrounding m82 all the way to the nuclear region , thus fueling the starburst . in summary",
    ", m82 seems to fit well into the picture of spiral formation presented by @xcite .",
    "the discovery of spiral arms in m82 throws new light on the inhomogeneous class of galaxies known as irrii galaxies .",
    "these are disk galaxies that differ from spirals in not showing an obvious spiral structure .",
    "they differ from irregulars ( i m , sm ) by showing a much redder and unresolved disk , and from lenticulars by having an early - type ( i.e. younger ) stellar spectrum .",
    "it is well known that starburst activity , dust obscuration and tidal interaction play varying degrees of importance in shaping different galaxies in this class @xcite .",
    "all the three phenomena are present in m82 .",
    "in fact , the tidal interaction is responsible for both the chaotic distribution of dust and triggering the starburst activity .",
    "this suggests that tidal interaction may play an important role in other galaxies of this class as well .",
    "@xcite have argued that the gross properties of m82  its mass , luminosity , size , mean spectral type  are comparable to those of normal late type ( sc / irr ) galaxies . the rather small bulge ( mass@xmath44@xmath5 ; gaffney , lester & telesco 1993 ) , and the relatively open arms inferred in the present work ( pitch angle of 14@xmath21 ) , suggest a late morphological type sbc for m82 .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank a. bressan , e. recillas , o. lpez - cruz , and i. puerari for discussions during different phases of this work .",
    "the presentation of the paper has vastly improved following the insights given by the referee .",
    "we thank g. escobedo and all the staff at oagh , especially e. castillo , for technical help during observations .",
    "this work is partly supported by conacyt ( mexico ) research grants g28586-e and 39714-f .",
    "this research has made use of the ned , which is operated by the jpl / nasa ."
