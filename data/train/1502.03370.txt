    "in the children s game of rock - paper - scissors , paper wraps rock , rock smashes scissors , and scissors cut paper .",
    "theoretical biologists have used this game as a metaphor in ecology and evolutionary biology to describe interactions among three competing species in which each species has an advantage over one of its opponents but not the other  @xcite , a situation that can result in cyclic dominance  @xcite .",
    "interactions of this type occur between three competing strains of _ e. coli _",
    "@xcite as well as in the mating strategies of side - blotched lizards  @xcite .",
    "the rock - paper - scissors game also has applications outside of biology .",
    "for example , it has been used to analyze the dynamics of a sociological system with three strategies in a public goods game  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the dynamics of the rock - paper - scissors game is often studied using the replicator equations  @xcite , a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations that have been applied in diverse scientific settings .",
    "for example , replicator equations have been used to model the evolution of language , fashion , autocatalytic chemical networks , behavioral dynamics , and multi - agent decision making in social networks  @xcite .    in the specific context of the rock - paper - scissors game ,",
    "the replicator equations are most often studied in the absence of mutation  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics in that case tend to exhibit one of three types of long - term behavior , depending on a parameter @xmath0 that characterizes how far the game is from being a zero - sum game .",
    "the three types of behavior are : ( i ) stable coexistence of all three species , ( ii ) neutrally stable cycles that fill the whole state space , and ( iii ) large - amplitude heteroclinic cycles in which each species in turn almost takes over",
    "the whole population and then almost goes extinct .    in 2010 , mobilia  @xcite broke new ground by asking what would happen if the strategies are allowed to mutate into one another . for simplicity he assumed that every species could mutate into every other at a uniform rate @xmath1 .",
    "for this highly symmetrical case ( which we call global mutation ) , mobilia  @xcite found a new form of behavior , not present in the mutation - free case : the system could settle into a stable limit - cycle oscillation , born from a supercritical hopf bifurcation .",
    "in this paper we investigate what happens in other mutational regimes .",
    "for example , we consider the dynamics when precisely one species mutates into one other , or when two species mutate into two others , as well as more complicated patterns of mutation . in every case",
    "we find that stable limit cycles can occur , and we calculate the regions in parameter space where such attracting periodic behavior occurs .",
    "our work was motivated by a question that arose in one of our previous studies  @xcite .",
    "there we had explored the dynamics of the repeated prisoner s dilemma game for three strategies : always defect ( alld ) , always cooperate ( allc ) , and tit - for - tat ( tft ) .",
    "we incorporated mutations at a rate @xmath1 and a complexity cost @xmath2 of playing tft into the replicator equations and analyzed the six possible single - mutation cases ( exactly one strategy mutates into one other with rate @xmath1 ) as well as the global mutation case ( each strategy mutates into the two others at the same rate @xmath1 ) .",
    "our results showed that stable limit cycles of cooperation and defection were possible for _ every _ pattern of mutation we considered .",
    "what was particularly striking was that stable cycles occurred for parameter values arbitrarily close to the structurally unstable limiting case of zero mutation rate and zero complexity cost @xmath3 .",
    "we conjectured , but were unable to prove , that stable limit cycles would continue to exist near this point for _ any _ pattern of mutation , not just the single - mutation patterns we looked at in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in hopes of finding a more tractable system where the same phenomena might occur",
    ", we turned to the rock - paper - scissors game .",
    "the analogous question is , does this system always exhibit stable limit cycles for parameters arbitrarily close to the zero - sum , zero - mutation - rate limit , for any possible pattern of mutation ?",
    "for single mutations , the answer is yes , as we will show below . for arbitrary patterns of mutation",
    ", the answer again appears to be yes , but we have only managed to prove this under a further constraint , namely that the mutation pattern preserves the symmetrical coexistence state where all three strategies are equally populated .",
    "the standard rock - paper - scissors game is a zero - sum game with payoff matrix given in table  [ tab : payoff0sum ] .",
    "the entries show the payoff received by the row player when playing with the column player .",
    "lcdr & & & + rock & 0 & -1 & 1 + paper & 1 & 0 & -1 + scissors & -1 & 1 & 0 +    according to the payoff matrix in table  [ tab : payoff0sum ] , each species gets a payoff @xmath4 when playing against itself .",
    "when playing against a different species , the winner gets a payoff @xmath5 while the loser gets @xmath6 .    a more general payoff matrix , considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , allows for non - zero - sum games .",
    "now the winner gets a payoff @xmath5 and the loser gets @xmath7 , as shown in table  [ tab : payoffeps1 ] .",

    "for the payoff matrix defined above in table  [ tab : payoffeps0 ] , and using @xmath15 , we find @xmath22 and @xmath23    a conceptual disadvantage of eliminating @xmath13 in favor of @xmath16 and @xmath17 is that the system s cyclic symmetry becomes less apparent . to highlight it , one can plot the phase portraits of the system on the equilateral triangle defined by the face of the simplex @xmath14 , where @xmath24 .",
    "this mapping of the phase portrait onto the equilateral triangle can be achieved by using the following transformation : @xmath25 in what follows , all phase portraits will be plotted in @xmath26 space , but we will still indicate the values of @xmath27 at the vertices of the simplex , since these variables have clearer interpretations .    equation   has four fixed points : @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "the inner fixed point undergoes a hopf bifurcation when @xmath30 , as shown in  @xcite .",

    "thus , all the subsequent stability diagrams in this paper will show a saddle connection curve along the line @xmath31 .",
    "because of the cyclic symmetry of the rock - paper - scissors game , it suffices to consider two of the six possible single - mutation pathways . so without loss of generality , we restrict attention to rock ( @xmath16 ) @xmath32 paper ( @xmath17 ) and paper @xmath33 @xmath32 rock @xmath34 .    the two cases are qualitatively different . in the first case ,",

    "for example , the state in which only rock exists , corresponding to the corner @xmath43 of the simplex , is no longer a fixed point , since @xmath16 is now constantly mutating into @xmath17 .",
    "so paper must exist whenever rock does .",

    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pr](a ) , the fixed point @xmath55 exists only for parameter values above the transcritical bifurcation curve . by linearizing about the fixed point and seeking a zero - eigenvalue bifurcation",

    "is identical to that for eq .",
    ", even though the two systems have qualitatively different dynamics .",
    "we have no explanation for this coincidence .",
    "it does not follow from any obvious symmetry , as evidenced by the fact that the inner fixed points @xmath39 are different in the two cases .",
    "if we allow mutations to occur along two pathways instead of one , and assume that they both occur at the same rate @xmath1 , then by the cyclic symmetry of the rock - paper - scissors game there are four qualitatively different cases to consider . the analysis becomes more complicated than with single mutations , so we omit the details and summarize the main results in the stability diagrams shown in figure  [ fig : double ] .",
    "the key point is that in every case , stable limit cycles exist arbitrarily close to the origin @xmath61 in parameter space , consistent with the conjecture discussed in the introduction .",

    "the second case occurs when both mutation pathways go in the same direction relative to the flow , as in fig .",

    "then the stability diagram has only two regions , similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : rp](a ) .    the final case , shown in fig .",

    "the boundary between the regions turns out to be exactly straight in cases like this . specifically , we find that the hopf curve here is given by the line @xmath63 .",
    "the key to the analysis is the observation that the interior fixed point reduces to @xmath64 for this case .",

    "the analytical treatment of the model becomes prohibitively messy as one adds more mutation pathways . to make further progress ,",

    "these mutation patterns are shown in table  [ table : hopf ] .",
    "we computed the hopf curve analytically for all of them and noticed something curious : the equation of the hopf curve is always @xmath71 as shown in table  [ table : hopf ] .    to derive this formula ,",

    "for example , we set @xmath75 if @xmath16 mutates into @xmath17 . otherwise , we set @xmath76 .",
    "the same sort of reasoning applies to the various @xmath77 and @xmath78 .    to ensure that @xmath79 is a fixed point of eq .",
    ", the indicator coefficients must satisfy certain algebraic constraints .",
    "these are given by @xmath80 using eqs .   and",
    ", one can then show that the fixed point @xmath79 undergoes a hopf bifurcation at @xmath81 which yields the results in table  [ table : hopf ] .",
    "the upshot is that a curve of supercritical hopf bifurcations emanates from the origin in parameter space .",
    "hence , for complex mutation patterns that preserve the fixed point @xmath70 , we have confirmed the conjecture that stable limit cycles exist for parameters arbitrarily close to the zero - sum , zero - mutation - rate limit of the replicator equations for the rock - paper - scissors game .",
    "our main result is that for a wide class of mutation patterns , the replicator - mutator equations for the rock - paper - scissors game have stable limit cycle solutions . for this class of mutation patterns ,",
    "a tiny rate of mutation and a tiny departure from a zero - sum game is enough to destabilize the coexistence state of a rock - paper - scissors game and to set it into self - sustained oscillations .",
    "another caveat is that our results have been obtained for one version of the replicator - mutator equations , namely , that in which the mutation terms are _ added _ to the replicator vector field . in making this choice we are following mobilia  @xcite , who investigated the effect of additive global mutation on the replicator dynamics for the rock - paper - scissors game .",
    "but there is another way to include the effect of mutation in the replicator equations : one can include it _ multiplicatively _ as in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . in biological terms",
    ", the multiplicative case makes sense if the mutations occur in the offspring , whereas in the additive case they occur in the adults .",
    "we found the additive case easier to work with mathematically , but it would be interesting to see if our results would still hold ( or not ) in the multiplicative case .",
