    "the development of structural changes in vortical flows and , particularly , vortex breakdown @xcite has been intensively investigated during the last years @xcite .",
    "the characteristic and fundamental signature of vortex breakdown is the appearance of a stagnation point followed by regions of reversed axial flows with a bubble structure when the swirl is sufficiently large .",
    "this structural change is also accompanied by a sudden change of the size of the core and the appearance of disturbances downstream the enlargement of the core .",
    "vortex breakdown is very important in several applications of fluid mechanics such as aerodynamics , combustion , nuclear fusion reactors or bioreactors .",
    "the presence of this phenomenon in these devices may be beneficial or detrimental , depending on each particular application @xcite .",
    "vortex breakdown ( vb ) has been firstly observed in open flows @xcite , but subsequently it has been obtained also in experiments performed in confined flows , for example , in closed cylinders @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the characteristics of vb in both cases are strongly similar , suggesting the possibility that the basic mechanism of vb is the same in both situations @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements show that flows in open channels can be accurately described with the relatively simple q - vortex model @xcite . on the other hand , an analytical description for closed flows which are considerable more complex than closed flows",
    "is not known @xcite .",
    "thus , experiments performed with flows confined in cylinders are very attractive in order to understand the basic mechanism of vb , as well as investigate possible control mechanisms .    due to the great number of practical implications of vb , the development of mechanisms for controlling its emergence is of considerable interest .",
    "recently , different methods for controlling vb in closed flows have been proposed using different techniques .",
    "the effect of adding a small , rotating or stationary , cylinder was first investigated using numerical and experimental techniques , by mullin _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite considered the addition of co- or counter rotation near the axis using a small central rod rotating independently of the bottom or rotating end wall .",
    "they concluded that such method may be an effective way to either enhance or suppress vb .",
    "other approaches are based on the introduction of a small rotating disk in the end wall opposite to the rotating wall @xcite , or the use of axial temperature gradients @xcite .    in the ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors found that a straight small cylinder does not change qualitatively the characteristics of the flow .",
    "they also considered the case of a stationary cylinder for fixed aspect ratio and reynolds number they did not find important qualitative changes with respect to the case without inner cylinder .",
    "they concluded that it is necessary to slope the inner boundary in order to significantly alter the vb bubble .",
    "however , as these authors recognize it is difficult to find a reliable measure for the onset of vb using dye visualization .",
    "it is clear that a more accurate technique is necessary in order to get quantitative experimental results for the vb onset .",
    "the aim of this work is to analyze accurately the effect of the presence of a rod at the cylinder axis on the vb for an important range of parameters . since the onset of vb",
    "is associated with the appearance of a stagnation point near the axis an accurate determination of the velocity field is necessary . using the digital particle image velocimetry ( dpiv ) technique we obtain the critical reynolds number for the onset of vb as a function of the aspect ratio and radius of the inner cylinder . in order to gain a deeper understanding of the internal structure of the flow and accuracy in the critical reynolds numbers , we considered necessary to complement our experimental observations with numerical simulations .",
    "it is found that the existence of rods can affect significantly the critical value of the reynolds number , @xmath1 for the onset of the vb .",

    "the experimental setup consists of an plexiglas cylindrical container of inner radius @xmath2 mm , a rotating disk at the top and a fixed disk at the bottom of the cylinder ( see figure [ setup ] ) .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]     ( diamonds ) , @xmath72 ( circles ) and @xmath73 ( squares ) ]    it is interesting to compare our results with those obtained in references @xcite , @xcite . in these two works , it was concluded that a very slender rod at rest does not introduce significant changes in vb phenomena .",
    "the radius ratio used by these authors was @xmath74 , which is similar to the small radius ratio value we considered , that is @xmath75 . in reference",
    "@xcite , the authors used an inner cylinder with ratio @xmath76 . in our experiments",
    "we observed appreciable changes in the critical value of @xmath77 , for all values of the ratios considered .",
    "looking carefully at figures 2 and 3 of @xcite , we observe slight differences which , according to the authors , are within the experimental errors .",
    "for this reason , we took specially careful measurements in these cases .    at this point",
    "it is interesting to consider the origin of the effect of the rod on vb , and in particular if it is of viscous nature or not .",
    "inviscid theory has largely used to explain the origin of vb .",
    "the results has been sufficiently succesfull to support the belief that vb may occur with no presence of viscosity . in ref .",
    "@xcite , brown and lopez argumented that vb in closed flows takes place in conditions for which the flow may be considered as inviscid . in this case , a change of sign in the azimuthal component of vorticity @xmath56 is expected to occurs near the stagnation point @xcite .",
    "this condition is verified in the vb that takes place without rod , as can be seen in figure [ vort1]a . in this figure ,",
    "the stagnation point occur at @xmath78 , where @xmath79 measures the height from below . however , this condition is not satisfied in the presence of the rods . in these cases ,",
    "the stagnation point occur near @xmath80 on rod surface .",
    "this point is surrounded with a region of constant @xmath56 sign , as can be seen in figures [ vort1]b , c , d .",
    "thus the relation of brown and lopez does not holds , showing that we can not expect to describe the vb appropriately with only inviscid theory in the presence of rods .",
    "the decrease of @xmath18 due to small rods appears to be of viscous origin .",
    "the presence of the rods tends to reduce the velocity of the fluid due to stress at the rod surface , favoring the appearance of the stagnation point and thus reducing the critical value @xmath18 needed for the appearance of vb .",
    "the reducing effect of the viscosity is also present in the absence of rods and may begin the process that leads to the formation of the stagnation point ( as occur in pipe flows @xcite ) , but the presence of the rigid limit imposed by the rod enhances this effect very much .",
    "thus , a very thin rod produces an significative effect , because the boundary conditions at the axis changes drastically from free to no - slip .",
    "this produces an appreciable change in @xmath18 .",
    "a similar result was obtained in previous works where it has been shown that even though a thin wire may promote the formation vb in delta wings @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we note that when the diameter @xmath0 is sufficiently large , the critical value of @xmath81 increases with increasing @xmath0 ( see fig . [ diag ] ) .",
    "this effect is probably of inviscid origin .",
    "we support this conjecture with the results of a simple model for flows in a pipe , described in the appendix . with this model",
    "we obtain that the suppressing effect of increasing @xmath0 also appears in unconfined pipe flows .",
    "then , when @xmath0 increases , this effect of inviscid nature compensates the viscous one and finally the vb is displaced to higher values of re .",
    "in this work , we studied the changes in the vb phenomena that are produced when a rod is located at the axis of the cylinder container i.e. the vortex centerline .",
    "the experiments shown that the rod may increase or decrease the critical reynolds number for the emergence of vb .",
    "the effect of small rods is to decrease @xmath18 , while @xmath1 is increased when @xmath68 is beyond a certain critical value @xmath82 , which is of order @xmath83 .",
    "this critical value depends weakly on the aspect ratio , decreasing smoothly with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "the effects of the rods of practical interest since may be used to perform a control of the vb in a way that is simpler than other previously proposed in the literature , since it does not require additional auxiliary devices .",
    "it is worth noting that this method , unlike the approach proposed in previous works , does not imply the addition of swirl near the axis .",
    "this simplicity is an interesting feature , making it more feasible to be used in engineering devices .",
    "the modification of the critical re are very noticeable .",
    "the volume ratio ( cylinder to row ) is @xmath84 , while the decrease of the critical reynolds number is about @xmath85 . so that the shift of the critical reynolds number is 20 times larger that the percent modification of the volume of the cylinder , showing the effectiveness of the method .",
    "the dependence of the critical re with the rod diameter obtained experimentally is in very good agreement with the found with numerical calculations . using a simple theoretical model for flow in pipes",
    ", we obtained that the influence of the inner cylinder on the vb works in similar fashion in open flows , mainly for not too small values of @xmath82 .",
    "we gave arguments to support that the enhancing effect of very small rods on vb is of viscous origin .",
    "[ model ] in this appendix , we consider a model for vb in open swirling pipe flows .",
    "our interest is to study how the vb is affected when an inner cylinder is located at the axis of the duct . with this purpose ,",
    "we use a simple model based on the failure of the cylindrical solution . in the past",
    ", it has been shown that simple theoretical vortex models of open flows may predict with some accuracy the emergence of vortex breakdown . a classical approach based on axisymmetric",
    "inviscid analysis was given by batchelor @xcite .",
    "in this model , it is assumed that initially the fluid moves inside a cylindrical duct of radius @xmath86  , with a rankine vortex velocity field , and goes to another duct limited by two cylindrical boundaries of different radius .",
    "when the flow develops the stagnation point , the radial component of the velocity becomes important and the cylindrical approximation is no longer valid @xcite .",
    "this is reflected in the disappearance of cylindrical solutions .",
    "thus in this model , the disappearance of cylindrical solutions is identified with the emergence of vb @xcite .    in a cylindrical system of coordinates ( @xmath87 ) the velocity field of the assumed upstream flow",
    "is written as : @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are constants , with @xmath91 , in order to impose the continuity of the velocity .",
    "we introduce the streamfunction @xmath92 defined as @xmath93 employing the momentum conservation we obtain the following equation for the streamfunction : @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 . for the flow given by eqs .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) , we have that @xmath97          we particularize now to consider the situation in which the upstream flow goes two a duct limited by to cylindrical surfaces of inner radius @xmath0 and outer radius @xmath103 . the unknown constants which appear in eq . ( [ solphi ] ) can be determined imposing the mass conservation and the continuity of the pressure . from these conditions ,",
