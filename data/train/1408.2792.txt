    ". the nucleus will miss the planet , its moons , and orbiting spacecraft .",
    "however , given the right combination of ejection velocity , ejection time , and response to radiation pressure , dust grains from the comet can reach the planet .",
    "@xcite predict that mars will miss the comet s orbit by @xmath8  km at 20:10 utc .",
    "this second close approach potentially reduces the energy required to place dust grains on impacting orbits .",
    "we present models of the dust and gas based on the summary of the comet s activity by farnham et al .",
    "( in preparation ) and estimate the impact hazard for mars and its satellites as well as the comet gas flux at mars .",
    "to assess the impact hazard , we generated two simulations of @xmath9 particles each , picked from broad parameter ranges .",
    "these raw simulations act as guides to determine which combinations of size , ejection speed , and ejection time may result in impacts .",
    "next , we define more limited parameter sets that are carefully chosen to match known parameters of the comet . we select and weight particles from the raw simulations that match those sets , and use them to estimate the fluence at mars . below we describe our dynamical model , the raw simulations , and four parameter sets used to estimate the impact hazard .",
    "the circumstances of the encounter are simulated with the dynamical model of @xcite . for this study",
    "we use the jpl ephemeris solution # 46 @xcite . in order to reduce the required computational time , we modified the model to use the two - body ( keplerian ) propagation functions from nasa s navigation and ancillary information facility spice toolkit .",
    "dust grains are parameterized by @xmath10 , the ratio of the force from solar radiation pressure to the force from solar gravity : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the radiation pressure efficiency , @xmath13 is the grain density in units of g@xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the grain radius in units of @xcite . in the keplerian solution ,",
    "the gravitational force from the sun is reduced by the factor @xmath16 .",
    "the magnitude of the error introduced by neglecting planetary perturbations can be estimated by comparing zero - ejection velocity syndynes ( lines of constant @xmath10 with variable ejection times ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) generated using the keplerian solution to those generated using the original code .",
    "the distances between the syndynes define the error . for grains ejected up to 4 years before the closest approach",
    ", the error is at most 300  km for dust found within @xmath17  km from the nucleus .",
    "we also considered whether the gravitational pull of mars is significant . ignoring the atmosphere ,",
    "particles grazing the surface are displaced @xmath18  km at closest approach , and the cross - section enhancement factor from gravitational focusing by mars is 1.008 @xcite .",
    "the keplerian solution is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "simulation  1 contains @xmath9 particles selected from the following parameters , based on observations of the comet with a generous conservative margin : ages range uniformly from 0 to 4  yr ( out to @xmath19  au ) ; expansion speeds range uniformly from 0 to @xmath20 , where @xmath21  ms@xmath5 is the expansion speed of 1  mm grains ejected at 5  au from the sun ; ejection velocities are radial and isotropically distributed around the nucleus ; and , radii are selected from a distribution uniform in log - space ( @xmath22 ) ranging from 10 to @xmath23  .",
    "the logarithmic distribution ensures our final results will have a statistically uniform representation of each size decade . for the conversion from radius to @xmath10 we assume a grain density of 1  g@xmath14 , and @xmath24 .",
    "( in preparation ) imaged siding spring at 4.6 , 3.8 , and 3.3  au from the sun with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "wfc3 instrument .",
    "the high spatial resolution of the images ( 40  mas per pixel , corresponding to @xmath25  km per pixel ) resolve the inner coma , and allow investigations of the dust grain expansion velocities .",
    "farnham et al .",
    "( in preparation ) analyzed those images and found that the dust that comprises the bulk of the coma and tail has speeds best matched by @xmath26 , for @xmath27  ms@xmath5 .",
    "grains with these speeds are a subset of simulation  1 .    for an alternative scenario",
    "we consider the analysis of the _ hubble _ images by li et al .. using the distance from the nucleus to the outer edge of the coma in the sunward direction , they find that the heliocentric distance dependence of the resulting speeds follow @xmath28  ms@xmath5 for @xmath29  au , assuming @xmath30 grains ( @xmath31  ms@xmath5 ) .",
    "speeds based on this relationship for @xmath32  au exceed those in simulation  1 .",
    "therefore , we ran a second @xmath9 particle simulation ( simulation 2 ) with speeds picked uniformly from 0 to @xmath33 for @xmath21  ms@xmath5 .",
    "however , we note that these speeds , derived from some of the fastest moving grains in the coma , are much higher than the farnham et al . results , derived from the coma and tail morphologies .",
    "analyses based on the li et al .",
    "speeds will serve as upper - limit cases for fast moving grains not accounted for in the farnham et al .",
    "approach .    in order to transform the simulations into an impact hazard at mars ,",
    "we first rotate the position vectors from the ecliptic j2000 coordinate frame into a reference frame defined at closest approach : the x - axis is given by the comet - mars position vector , the y - axis by the comet - mars velocity vector , and the z - axis by the right - hand rule .",
    "simulations 1 and 2 projected into this reference frame is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xyz ] .",
    "the relative timing of grains arriving at mars is based on their y - axis position ; @xmath34  km corresponds to a time difference of 29.8  min .",
    "we then weight each particle to remove the bias introduced by our raw simulation s grain size distribution , and to provide a real estimate of the grain s frequency of occurrence in the comet coma .",
    "the particle weights are based on the parameter sets in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "set a is the nominal case , directly based on the results of farnham et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "sets b , c , and d are variations chosen to provide upper - limit estimates on the impacting dust .",
    "first , consider that the tail analysis of farnham et al .",
    "best describes the smallest grains ( @xmath35  ) and closest heliocentric distances ( 3  au @xmath36 5  au ) , and is extrapolated to larger @xmath15 and @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , as an alternative scenario , we have defined set b using a radius and heliocentric distance dependence in closer agreement to theoretical predictions : @xmath38 ( cf . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the speeds follow @xmath39  ms@xmath5 , corresponding to @xmath40 for @xmath41 ( @xmath42  ) .",
    "set c has the same parameters as set b , but the dust is shifted closer to mars according to the ephemeris s 3-@xmath7 error ellipse @xcite . in our closest approach reference frame described above , the dust is displaced by @xmath43  km , @xmath44  km .",
    "set d is based on our nominal case , but uses simulation 2 and the ejection speeds found by li et al .",

    "the raw simulations provide a guide to understanding what combination of grain size , ejection velocity , and age results in an impact hazard at mars . we define impacts at mars as any particle found within a distance of 10,000  km from the center of the planet .",

[ fig : beta - age - speed ] ]      for each parameter set , the impact hazards are computed by taking the set of particles found in each region of interest , removing those speeds outside the set s range , and weighting remaining particles according to the set s total production rate , grain size distribution , etc .",
    "table  [ tab : parameters ] lists , for mars , the raw number of impacting grains ( i.e. , before particle weighting ) , the impact fluence ( i.e. , after particle weighting ) , and the start and stop times of the hazard .",
    "no impacts are expected based on our nominal model , nor the @xmath90 model ( sets a and d ) because the ejection speeds of dust grains at @xmath91  au are too low to place particles within the vicinity of mars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beta - age - speed ] ) .",
    "in addition , displacing the comet dust in these two models according to the ephemeris 3-@xmath7 uncertainty ellipse does not result in any impacts .    in order to attain impacting particle trajectories ,",
    "higher ejection speeds are needed at @xmath91  au .",
    "this requirement is accomplished with the size-@xmath37-speed relationship of parameter set b , resulting in a total fluence of @xmath92  grainsm@xmath1 .",
    "based on the comet s current predicted closest approach time , the grains arrive between 19:57 and 20:17 utc ( time at mars ) , nearly centered on the epoch at which mars crosses the comet s orbital plane @xcite . note that non - gravitational forces frequently act upon comet nuclei , but we can neglect these effects because the dust is ejected at heliocentric distances where activity and resulting non - gravitational forces were low ( see fig .",
    "5 of * ? ? ?",
    "however , the current nucleus ephemeris uncertainty is still valid for the dust . displacing the dust in parameter set b closer to mars ( set c ) shifts the arrival time 5  min earlier and increases the fluence by a factor of 4 .",
    "the fluence results are summarized for mars and _ maven _ in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluence ] .",
    "the grains are limited to 1 to 3  mm in radius , due to the combined effects of radiation pressure , grain age , and ejection speed .",
    "the timing of the hazard at _ maven _ s distant apoapsis is 25  min later than the hazard at mars , and the fluences are a factor of 2 higher . in all simulations , the deimos region of interest remained dust free .",
    "gas outflow and nucleus gravity limits the size of dust grains that can be placed into heliocentric orbit .",
    "@xcite present the critical dust radius , @xmath93 , that can be lifted off a spherical nucleus by estimating the drag force on a spherical grain , and integrating the resulting equation of motion , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the atmoic weight of the driving gas , @xmath96 is the mass of hydrogen , @xmath97 is the gas production rate ( moleculess@xmath5 ) , @xmath98 is the expansion speed of the gas , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the grain and nucleus densities , @xmath101 is the nucleus radius , and @xmath102 is the gravitation constant . let @xmath103  kms@xmath5 to be consistent with farnham et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , and let the nucleus density be 0.3  g@xmath14 . the radius of the nucleus has not been measured , but @xcite estimate @xmath104  km based on water projection rates from _ swift _ photometry .",
    "therefore we consider two values : 0.5 and 2.0  km . for our adopted parameters , co@xmath78 can lift grains larger than 100   at heliocentric distances inside of 14 and 8  au for @xmath105 and 2.0  km , respectively .",
    "however , our parameter set ejection speeds only place particles on impacting trajectories for @xmath106  au ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beta - age - speed ] ) .",
    "thus , given this simplistic model , an impact hazard may not be expected if the nucleus radius is @xmath107  km or larger .",
    "overall , we do not expect any impacts on mars - orbiting spacecraft .",
    "based on the cross - sectional area of mars and our 10,000  km average fluence , the planet may receive up to @xmath2 grain impacts from 1- to 3-mm - radius grains , totaling @xmath3  kg , based on our models . at most",
    ", a few impacts may be expected on phobos ( @xmath108 ) , and no impacts at deimos .",
    "@xcite and @xcite predict a significantly larger impact hazard , with fluences of 0.1  grainsm@xmath1 and larger .",
    "their large fluences appear to be primarily due to their choice of ejection speeds .",
    "@xcite use @xmath109  ms@xmath5 ( a.  moorhead , private communication ) , and @xcite use @xmath50 up to 20  ms@xmath5 ( j.  vaubaillon , private communication ) .",
    "unfortunately , few observations that could constrain the dust expansion speeds , if any , were available to these investigators .",
    "in contrast , @xcite and @xcite constrain their fluence estimates using observations of the comet .",
    "@xcite base their methods on the farnham et al .",
    "( in preparation ) and li et al .",
    "( in preparation ) data , the same as our investigation , but with slightly different interpretations .",
    "they both predict little to no risk of impacts for the mars - orbiting spacecraft , despite their independent approaches .",
    "in particular , @xcite used observations of siding spring and the similarly bright comet c/2012 s1 ( ison ) to derive the dependence of ejection speed on size and @xmath37 : @xmath110 best matched their data , assuming a 2.5-km - radius nucleus and 0.3-g@xmath14 dust , resulting in no impacts for @xmath111  mm , and a fluence of @xmath112  grainsm@xmath1 for grains down to 10   in radius . in our parameterization , these speeds correspond to @xmath113  ms@xmath5 , higher than our set b. using their speeds and our production rate history , we find the same fluence , @xmath114  grainsm@xmath1 , but all impacts are millimeter sized .",
    "finally , we compare our results to the natural background of meteoroids estimated for the mars reconnaissance orbiter . over a 5-year period ,",
    "the total fluence for meteoroids with @xmath115  mm is 0.0021  grainsm@xmath1 , and for @xmath111  mm , it is 3.1  grainsm@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "our predicted fluences from comet siding spring are orders of magnitude smaller than these values , and we conclude the comet poses little additional hazard to the spacecraft",
    ".      the neutral coma gases will enter the atmosphere with a relative velocity of 56  kms@xmath5 .",
    "the kinetic energies of these molecules greatly exceeds their dissociation energies , e.g. , for h@xmath78o , the kinetic energy is 293 ev , and the dissociation energy ( h@xmath78o @xmath116",
