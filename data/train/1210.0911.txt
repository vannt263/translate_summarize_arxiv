    "the theoretical description of the electronic properties of transition metal compounds with partially filled @xmath1 and @xmath2-shells and strong coulomb interaction between the electrons remains a challenging , fundamental problem in condensed matter physics .",
    "@xcite the interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in such materials results in their diverse physical properties and rich phase diagrams making these compounds particularly attractive for technological applications .",
    "@xcite moreover , orbital degeneracy is an important and often inevitable cause of this complexity .",
    "together with the hund s exchange interaction , it has important implications for the electronic and magnetic properties of correlated materials , leading to formation of local moments and complicated multiplet structures .",
    "the electronic properties of correlated materials can be understood by employing the so - called lda+dmft approach ,  @xcite a combination of _ ab initio _ local density approximation ( lda ) of the density functional theory and dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "nowadays , the lda+dmft technique has become a state - of - the - art method for realistic description of correlated electron materials from first principles .",
    "this approach provides a systematic many - body treatment of the effect of local electronic correlations by taking into account temporal fluctuations while spatial fluctuations are neglected .",
    "applications of lda+dmft for correlated electron compounds such as transition metals and their oxides have provided important insights into our understanding of the electronic and magnetic properties of these materials . in particular , by employing the lda+dmft technique it has become possible to obtain a good quantitative description of localized as well as delocalized electron states .",
    "in addition , the approach allows one to determine the electronic and magnetic properties of correlated compounds in both paramagnetic and magnetically ordered states .    nevertheless , there are two important limitations of conventional implementations of the lda+dmft method .",
    "the first originates from the single - site ( local ) nature of dmft .",
    "in particular , the key assumption of the theory is the limit of infinite spatial dimension , which allows one to perform an exact mapping of a complex lattice model ( such as the hubbard model ) to a quantum impurity with an energy - dependent external bath , resulting in @xmath3-independent self - energy .",
    "however , in some cases the non - local spatial correlations can be essential to provide a correct description of the properties of correlated materials .",
    "@xcite for instance , the standard lda+dmft calculations are not able to capture the reduction of magnetic transition temperature due to long - wavelength spin waves . to resolve this problem several methods",
    "have been recently proposed ,  @xcite which we leave beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "the second limitation concerns the spin rotational symmetry of the hund s exchange interaction .",
    "since correlated materials often have several bands at the fermi level , it requires specific treatment of the local coulomb interaction , which in a cubic environment consists of the intra- and inter - orbital coulomb interactions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , hund s exchange @xmath6 , and the pair - hopping coupling @xmath7 .",
    "these interactions obey spin and orbital rotational symmetry , thereby @xmath8 ensures the rotational invariance in the orbital space and @xmath9 can be assumed whenever the spin - orbital coupling is negligible .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to handle all these multiband interactions including hund s exchange coupling and the pair hopping term with the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method .",
    "in particular , a straightforward implementation leads to a severe sign problem making such simulations unfeasible .",
    "therefore , at present , the most material - specific calculations employ the approximate form of the coulomb repulsion restricted to the ising - type exchange interaction .",
    "these calculations often provide a good quantitative description of the electronic , magnetic , and structural properties of correlated materials as a function of the reduced temperature @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the calculated temperature of magnetic ordering .",
    "@xcite however , the correct symmetry of the exchange interaction turns out to be essential for quantitative description of the electronic and magnetic properties of correlated systems .",
    "@xcite    this problem can be overcome by using some quantum impurity solvers such as numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) ,  @xcite exact diagonalization ( ed ) ,  @xcite continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) ,  @xcite and others ,  @xcite which allow one to treat the coulomb interaction in its general form with preserved spin rotational symmetry .",
    "these calculations performed for the two- and three - band hubbard models on the infinite - dimensional bethe  @xcite and hypercubic  @xcite lattices show a substantial overestimation of the magnetic transition temperature for the approximate ising - type form of the exchange coulomb interaction with respect to the rotationally invariant one . in accordance with this",
    ", recent lda+dmft calculations of correlated compounds also indicate that the magnetic transition temperatures appear to be significantly overestimated by using the density - density type of coulomb interaction .",
    "@xcite however , applications of these techniques so far have been mostly limited to simple model systems and only a few realistic calculations for 3@xmath1 compounds have been recently presented .",
    "@xcite this is mostly because of high computational costs ( exponential with the number of orbitals ) of these methods implemented with the full rotationally invariant coulomb interaction which makes such calculations for @xmath12 and @xmath13 materials extremely expensive . obviously , the lda+dmft investigations of correlated materials with the coulomb interaction in its general form with preserved spin rotational symmetry remain problematic and pose a great theoretical challenge .    in this paper , we present an implementation of the lda+dmft approach which allows us to take into account rotational symmetry of the exchange coulomb interaction .",
    "this approach is formulated in terms of the hirsch - fye quantum monte carlo algorithm  @xcite where the spin rotational invariance of hund s exchange is approximated by averaging over all possible directions of the spin quantization axis .",
    "it provides a robust and computationally efficient method which allows us to simulate the five - orbital systems at high temperatures . using this technique we perform benchmark calculations for the two- and three - band hubbard models on the infinite - dimensional bethe lattice .",
    "in addition , we employ the proposed approach to calculate the electronic and magnetic properties of paramagnetic @xmath0 iron and nickel . to outline the importance of rotational symmetry of the exchange coulomb interaction we compare our results with those obtained by using the density - density approximation .",
