    "in the present work we report the results of a new measurement of the muon - induced neutron production at shallow depth , based on the palo verde neutrino detector @xcite . even though the device was designed for a different purpose , namely the detection of reactor @xmath2 , it was possible to operate it in a mode suitable for the identification of muon - induced neutrons .",
    "neutrons and other hadrons produced by cosmic - ray muons in the earth are an important and unavoidable source of background for underground low rate experiments .",
    "knowledge of the rates for these processes is an essential part of understanding backgrounds in neutrino detectors and other low counting rate experiments .",
    "for example , since muon - produced fast single or multiple neutrons can mimic the correlated signature of inverse neutron beta decay , searches for neutrino oscillations at nuclear reactors @xcite must cope with this source of background .",
    "other neutrino and proton decay experiments , as well as dark matter searches ( even though often at greater depth ) , have to cope with this source of background as well .",
    "the cdms experiment , for instance , is searching for cold dark matter @xcite , and is presently at shallow depth ; muon - induced neutrons represent a major source of background .",
    "low - energy accelerator neutrino oscillation searches @xcite are usually performed near the earth s surface where muon - induced neutrons are a significant source of background .",
    "another example is the proposed orland neutrino detector at the spallation neutron source at oak ridge national laboratory @xcite which is also planned to be at shallow depth .    despite the importance of the subject",
    ", relatively little recent progress has been reported .",
    "several measurements of the neutron production rates at various depths conducted in the past suggest a smooth dependence of the neutron yield on depth or , equivalently , on the average muon energy @xcite .",
    "however , a more recent measurement by the lvd collaboration @xcite , resulting in a smaller yield , is in disagreement with this simple dependence on depth . at shallow depth , where the average muon energy is @xmath3 10 gev , the smooth trend was confirmed by measurements with relatively small detectors without much shielding against the neutrons produced outside them @xcite . in the more recent experiment @xcite , the single and double neutron yields were determined separately , and pion production by muons was also observed .",
    "one drawback of that experiment , possibly present in the other ones as well , is the difficulty of distinguishing between the neutrons produced in the detector ( the intended source of neutrons ) and the neutrons produced outside by the muon - induced showers .",
    "in fact , in ref . @xcite it has been estimated that half of the detected single neutrons originated in the hadron showers outside the detector volume .    the theoretical description of this background process is usually based on the assumption that the electromagnetic interaction of high - energy muons with matter can be modeled by replacing the exchanged virtual photon by  equivalent \" real photons , and using known photo - nuclear reaction cross sections @xcite .",
    "the analysis is complicated , since in order to relate the theoretical neutron production yield to measurement , the propagation and possible cascade multiplication of all reaction products must be understood .",
    "( for example , a @xmath4 produced by a muon will make more neutrons , as does the @xmath5 reaction , etc . ) . while the smooth variation noted above for the neutron reaction rate versus depth",
    "is supported in some calculations @xcite , other approaches come to different conclusions@xcite .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite was devoted , unlike the others , to the relatively shallow depth relevant for the present work . in that work ,",
    "the calculated neutron yield was smaller than the measured one @xcite , while the calculated and measured @xmath6 yields agreed with each other .",
    "one should also keep in mind that while the theoretical description quoted above deals with the muon - nucleus interaction involving the exchange of a virtual photon , neutrons can be also produced by nuclear interactions involving real bremsstrahlung photons , and electron / positron pairs created during the passage of muons through matter.(the present experiment can not separate neutrons created by interactions involving virtual photons from those produced by interactions of real photons . )",
    "the measurement of the neutron production rate was performed at @xmath7 meter - water - equivalent ( mwe ) depth using the palo verde neutrino detector .",
    "the detector and its operation is described in detail in ref .",
    "briefly , the apparatus consists of 66 acrylic cells , each 900 x 12.7 x 25.4 @xmath8 .",
    "these cells are filled with liquid scintillator loaded with gd 0.1% by weight , for a total scintillator volume of 11.34 tons .",
    "the acrylic material has an aggregate mass of 3.48 tons .",
    "muons can thus spall either in the scintillator volume or in the acrylic material , and the resulting neutrons can not be distinguished by source .",
    "neutrons , when moderated to thermal energies , are preferentially captured on gd , resulting in a @xmath9 mev gamma - ray cascade , the characteristic neutron capture signal .",
    "the central active detector volume is surrounded by a 1 m thick water shield , and the outermost layer of the detector is an active muon veto counter providing 4@xmath10 coverage .",
    "since the apparatus was intended for the detection of reactor neutrinos , it was not optimized for the neutron yield measurement . for the present purpose",
    "special runs were performed without the trigger rejection of the cosmic rays .",
    "the throughgoing muon sample was selected off - line such that at least two veto hits were recorded . only muons which at the same time went through at least three cells of the central detector",
    "were included .",
    "the delayed neutron capture events , recognized by their energy deposit , are of two kinds : the `` single bank '' events , where only one neutron capture candidate event occurs following the veto hit ; and the `` two bank '' events , which have two neutron capture candidate events following the muon .",
    "( the detector electronics is not capable of recording more than two correlated events . )",
    "the measured quantities are the numbers of single ( @xmath11 ) and double neutron - capture events ( @xmath12 ) associated with @xmath13 muons traversing the central detector .",
    "the average path length of these muons in the central detector is @xmath14 ( measured in units of g/@xmath1 ) .",
    "since some of the neutrons could have been created in the water shield or in other external detector parts , correction factors @xmath15 are applied to @xmath16 .",
    "finally , the neutron detection efficiencies @xmath17 are introduced . here , e.g",
    ", @xmath18 is the probability that one neutron was created and one detected , while @xmath19 is the probability that two neutrons were created and only one detected . if all these quantities were known one could define neutron yields @xmath20 , etc .",
    "( per muon and g/@xmath1 ) , where @xmath21 is the number of neutrons , that are independent of the detector properties and obey the relation @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the detection livetime correction which in this case depends on the number of detected neutron - like events @xmath24 .    obviously , since only two quantities , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are measured , only two yields can be determined , and the system above can not be solved without approximations . it is assumed further that the contributions from four or more produced neutrons can be neglected , as indicated in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "moreover , as will be shown below , the @xmath25 neutron yield @xmath26 is essentially independent of the ratio @xmath27 , i.e. , on the assumed value of @xmath28 , while the deduced single and double neutron yields @xmath29 and @xmath30 depend on that ratio significantly .",
    "thus , the final results of the present experiment will be expressed as the measurement of @xmath31 .",
    "note that the quantities @xmath32 , and thus also @xmath31 , contain @xmath33 processes that lead to the production of @xmath24 neutrons by the muon .",
    "thus , if the muon creates a @xmath4 ( or any other particle except a neutron ) which then , in turn , creates @xmath24 neutrons , all of the neutrons , regardless of source , contribute to @xmath32 .",
    "this somewhat awkward definition is necessary since the evaluation of the efficiencies @xmath17 is based on a code that tracks just neutron propagation in the detector .",
    "the neutron capture events were recorded in two runs , each about half of a day long .",
    "the raw muon veto rate was about 2 khz and the rate of muons which went through at least three cells of the central detector and caused two or more detectable veto hits in the first ( second ) run was 270(275 ) hz .",
    "these two runs are essentially equivalent , and the final total number of muons was determined to be @xmath34 , very similar in both runs .    the average path length @xmath14 of the muons is estimated with a simple ray - tracing monte carlo simulation , starting from a @xmath35 zenith angle distribution .",
    "the resulting @xmath14 was 125 g/@xmath1 for the central detector ( i.e. , the scintillator , the acrylic cells and the small amount of other materials ( cu , fe ) in the central detector ) and 317 and 62 g/@xmath1 for the water shield and veto counter , respectively .",
    "the neutron capture events @xmath36 were selected using cuts similar to the neutron part of the neutrino signal @xcite . for the single neutron events a time cut of 10 - 100 @xmath37s between the last muon event and the neutron capture event was used , while for the two neutron events only the lower limit of 10 @xmath37s was kept , the upper one being irrelevant .",
    "the time between the two neutron capture events was restricted to 5 - 100 @xmath37s .",
    "the energy distributions of all neutron events had identical shapes within statistics .",
    "there are several contributions to the livetime correction factors @xmath23 . the largest one , which affects primarily the single neutron events , arises since the initial information is overwritten when another muon strikes the veto after the single neutron event was recorded and before the 450 @xmath37s time interval of accepting new events .",
    "combining the correction for this effect with other deadtime corrections , the resulting @xmath38 = 30.8(27.8)% for the one - neutron events in the first(second ) runs , and @xmath39 = 72.4(70.3)% for the two - neutron events . the difference in @xmath23 between the two runs",
    "is caused primarily by the @xmath40 change in the raw muon rate .",
    "the distribution of the time interval between the muon and the single - neutron event is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "1 , while the lower panel shows the same distribution for the first of the two neutron events .",
    "the fitted curves are of the form @xmath41 here @xmath42s for the single neutron case while @xmath43s ( not very far from half of the previous @xmath44 , the value one expects for two neutrons ) for the double neutron case , are the characteristic neutron capture times .",
    "both agree quite well with the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation , as seen in fig .",
    "the presence of the time constant @xmath45 is related to the inhomogeneous nature of the detector .",
    "some neutrons enter the acrylic , where there is no gd available for captures , thus prolonging their capture time . finally , the last term , with the fixed time constant of 500 @xmath37s , represents the accidental background ( 500 @xmath37s is the average time interval between successive muons ) .",
    "using such a fit one can subtract the accidental background in the relevant time window , and calculate the corresponding correction for the described choice of the time cuts .    in fig .",
    "2 the distribution of the elapsed time between the two neutron capture events is shown , and again fitted to the same functional dependence , eq .",
    "the distinction between the top and bottom panels is explained below . ) here , the time constant @xmath46s in the top panel is substantially smaller than the @xmath44 obtained by the mc simulation ( @xmath47s , as expected if only two neutrons are involved ) .",
    "this feature suggests that the data sample contains a nonnegligible component with more than two neutrons .",
    "we will return to this point later .",
    "while the evaluation of @xmath13 , @xmath48 , and @xmath14 is rather straightforward , the determination of the efficiency matrix @xmath17 is somewhat model dependent .",
    "this is because , in order to calculate @xmath17 , one needs the initial energy and angular distributions of the created neutrons , both of which are poorly known . in practice , a number of physically plausible assumptions are made about these distributions , and the spread among the resulting efficiencies yields a measure of the systematic uncertainty .",
    "once the neutron initial distribution is chosen , the monte carlo simulation of the neutron transport developed for the neutrino experiment @xcite is used .",
    "the detector geometry , materials and electromagnetic interactions are simulated using geant @xcite .",
    "hadronic interactions are simulated by fluka @xcite , and the low energy neutron transport by gcalor @xcite .    to evaluate the quantities @xmath18 and @xmath49 initial single neutrons",
    "were distributed randomly in position and initial angles through the detector volume . for the initial energy distribution ,",
    "several possibilities were used : the exponential distribution @xmath50 as proposed by the karmen collaboration @xcite , and functions with the power dependence @xmath51 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these cover the shape following @xmath52 suggested by the experience with photo - nuclear processes @xcite .",
    "all of these distributions result in similar efficiencies . using the spread of the calculated values as a measure of the systematic error , and taking a simple average as the most probable value , one obtains @xmath53 note that the probability that a single initial neutron will result in two neutron captures , characterized by @xmath49 , is quite small .",
    "the determination of two neutron efficiencies is even more difficult , since it depends on the energy distribution of both initial neutrons . to evaluate the quantities @xmath54 and @xmath55 two neutrons",
    "were created at the same random point and with random directions for each of them .",
    "two extremes were considered . in the first of them , the total energy of the neutrons followed one of the previously described functions used above in the single neutron case .",
    "this initial energy was distributed randomly between them .",
    "( essentially the same efficiency was obtained if the two neutrons shared the initial available energy equally . )",
    "the other extreme is obtained if both neutrons each have the energy distribution used in the single neutron case , i.e. , the total neutron energy is on average twice as large .",
    "the spread ( not very large ) was again used in the averaging and in the estimate of the systematic error , resulting in @xmath56    note that there is a sizable probability that only one neutron is detected when two were initially created . none of the previous analyses , in particular ref .",
    "@xcite , took that into account .",
    "next , one has to consider the possibility that three neutrons were spalled by the muon , but only one or two were detected .",
    "again , using the average and the two extreme possibilities to divide the available energy among the three neutrons , one obtains @xmath57 it is important to realize that these efficiencies are not much smaller than those for initial one or two neutrons .",
    "thus , the effect of @xmath28 should be considered .",
    "( the effect of four and more neutron spallation will be neglected , however . )",
    "the correction factors @xmath58 that exclude neutrons created outside the central detector volume ( i.e. in the water shield since the effect of the veto is negligible ) , but captured there , must be determined also . to do that",
    ", the efficiencies for each passive volume were determined using the same monte carlo code as for the case of the central detector .",
    "then @xmath58 were determined from @xmath59 resulting in @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in order to obtain the above values a crude assumption @xmath62 , was used .",
    "it is important to note that the uncertainties of @xmath58 are strongly correlated with the error in the efficiencies .",
    "the effect of the neutron component of hadronic cascades created outside the veto , and coincident with the muon which created them , remains to be determined .",
    "the ratio of muons making three hits in the veto , thus involving more than one particle , to the prevalent case of the two hits was employed as a measure of the frequency of showers .",
    "this ratio was @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the first and second runs , respectively , i.e. , about 7% of muons entering the veto were accompanied by a shower .    to see that the ` triple - veto - hit ' events are really different from the standard throughgoing muons with just two veto hits , one can form ratios @xmath65 @xmath66 which represent a quantitative measure of the neutron content of the showers .",
    "the measured values are @xmath67 and @xmath68 , both significantly larger than unity .",
    "thus the shower events indeed are richer in neutrons , particularly in the two neutron sample",
    ".    moreover , the double neutron events with three veto hits have distinctly different time structure than the more common ones with just two veto hits .",
    "this is shown in the bottom part of fig . 2 for the interevent time , i.e. the elapsed time between the first and second neutron captures .",
    "the corresponding time constant @xmath44 for the three - veto - hit events is significantly smaller than for the two - veto - hit events , showing that the shower events have a large multineutron component .",
    "a similar effect is present when the capture time of the first neutron is considered .",
    "it is therefore likely that the discrepancies between data and simulation in the time dependence of the interevent time interval , noted above , are the consequence of a multineutron ( @xmath69 ) component in the two bank events .    since the shower events contain an unknown number of neutrons created outside the detector volume , they are excluded from further consideration .",
    "in the first run , the observed numbers of neutron captures , corrected for the random background and with the effect of showers subtracted , were @xmath70 , @xmath71 , while in the second run @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "the two runs , which were separated in time by 10 months , give consistent results when the differences in @xmath74 is taken into account , proving that the experiment is stable .    as a first step",
    ", the yields are analysed as in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , only the ` diagonal ' efficiencies @xmath75 are taken into account , thus @xmath76 the resulting yields obtained by averaging the two runs are : @xmath77    the exclusion of external showers , characterized by the three - veto - hit events , has resulted in the reduction of @xmath78 by 14% , and of @xmath79 by 45% .",
    "thus , presumably due to the presence of the sizable shield @xmath80 , the effect of the external showers , while still clearly present , was reduced compared to the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , where ( in the same units ) @xmath81 and @xmath82 without ( with ) the correction for external showers .",
    "however , the proper analysis should include the full efficiency matrix , i.e. , the possibility that two neutrons were initially produced but only one neutron capture was recorded and vice versa , as well as the possibility that three neutrons were originally produced and only two or one neutron captures were observed . as pointed out earlier , with only two measured capture rates , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , it is impossible to deduce all the relevant information without further constraints . to avoid these difficulties , and to make the comparison with other experiments easier , the @xmath25 number of neutrons produced per muon was evaluated .",
    "this quantity , @xmath31 , defined earlier in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , has the further advantage that it is essentially independent of the ratio @xmath27 for three to two neutron production , as demonstrated in table i.    thus , the final result of the present measurement can be expressed as @xmath83 where the systematic error is an estimate based on the spread of values in table i added in quadrature to the spread of the evaluated efficiencies .",
    "all available data on neutron yields are collected and compared in fig .",
    "( it is assumed that the other measurements ( @xcite ) also are really @xmath31 measurements . ) for the measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite both results , with and without the correction for external showers , are shown . in some of the other measurement",
    "the shower contribution was excluded , but it is not clear how well this has been done , since at least the results at 25 and 316 mwe were obtained with relatively small and unshielded detectors .",
    "at shallow depth there are now three measurements , with essentially consistent results . clearly , still better and more complete measurements are desirable , in which the full neutron multiplicity and energy spectra are determined and the neutrons produced externally are reliably identified .",
