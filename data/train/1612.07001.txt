    "graphene @xcite is a low defect material @xcite with weak hyperfine interaction @xcite , long spin coherence and relaxation times @xcite making it a promising medium for quantum information storage and processing based on the electron spins @xcite .",
    "however , the implementation of spin quantum information circuitry requires carrier confinement @xcite which in monolayer graphene is excluded by the klein tunneling effect @xcite .",
    "the energy gap required for such electrostatic confinement can be induced by lateral confinement in graphene nanoribbons @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a finite size flake of graphene @xcite could be used as a quantum dot for the carrier confinement . for both nanoribbons and nanoflakes the properties of the confined states",

    "the influence of the edges can be eliminated in a biased bilayer graphene which can host quantum dots defined electrostatically @xcite .",
    "spin - orbit coupling is a necessary prerequisite for the manipulation of confined spins by electric fields @xcite . in graphene",
    "the spin - orbit coupling is very weak since the intrinsic carbon atom spin - orbit coupling is not transferred to the @xmath0 graphene band due to the orthogonality of @xmath1 orbitals with @xmath2 and @xmath3 forming the @xmath4 bonds within the layer @xcite . in bilayer",
    "graphene the path for a stronger spin - orbit coupling could be opened by interlayer @xmath0 and @xmath4 bands mixing @xcite , which however turns out to be ineffective @xcite , and therefore resulting in a spin - orbit coupling energy exactly on the level of the single layer material .",
    "however , the spin - orbit coupling can be introduced into graphene by adatoms @xcite , e.g. hydrogen @xcite or fluorine @xcite .",
    "the fluorine adatoms , even in the dilute limit @xcite , increase the single - layer spin - orbit coupling energy substantially .",
    "a local deformation of the graphene sheet by flurorine produces @xmath4-@xmath0 band mixing @xcite as in folded graphene or carbon nanotubes @xcite givings rise to spin - dependent hopping near the adatom .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is the characterization of the spin - flip electric - dipole spin resonance ( edsr ) @xcite in a bilayer graphene quantum dot by external nano - engineered electrostatic potential , in which the spin - orbit interaction is introduced by fluorine adatoms at the top layer .",
    "we consider dilute adatom concentrations , for which the band structure of graphene is perturbed to a minimal extent .",
    "we consider the system near the neutrality point and determine the hamiltonian eigenstates using the atomistic tight binding approach that are next used for description of the spin resonance driven by ac electric field .",
    "we find that already at 0.5% concentration of the fluorine adatoms the spin - flip transition time driven by the ac field are shorter than the spin - relaxation times @xcite , which should allow for an experimental induction and detection of spin - flips in pauli - blocked quantum dots @xcite .",

    "we assume that the spin - orbit coupling interactions induced by the fluorine adatoms are limited to the nearest neighbours of the fluorinated carbon atom in the upper layer @xcite , which is justified by the weaker coupling along the vertical interlayer van der waals bond and the large ratio of the distance of the nearest interlayer and intralayer neighbors @xcite @xmath41  and @xmath42  , respectively .",

    ". we also account for the skew interlayer nearest - neighbor direct hopping between the carbon atoms that do not form dimers [ fig .",

    "this coupling produces trigonal warping @xcite of the fermi level near the dirac points .",
    "since we deal with localized states a contribution of the wave vectors off the dirac points is likely , hence the inclusion of skew hoppings within the model .",

    "although the present modification of the interlayer distance is an upper bound to the actual one , the corrections of the harrison law to the hopping elements as well as the ones due to the skew hopping elements have only a very weak effect on the energies of the confined states in the considered dilute limit of fluorine adatoms . nevertheless , the skew hopping influences the transition rates ( see below ) .     in the figure .",

    "the spin - transitions that are allowed by the strong local spin - orbit coupling interactions in the neighborhood of the adatoms even for the dilute concentration of the fluorine reach sub - nanosecond range below the spin relaxation times in graphene , and which should allow for their observation in the lifting of spin pauli blockade of the current .",

    "<S> spin transitions driven by a periodically varying electric potential in dilute fluorinated graphene quantum dots are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> flakes of monolayer graphene are considered as well as electrostatic electron traps induced in bilayer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the stationary states are obtained within the tight - binding approach and are used to the basis of eigenstates to describe the system dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the dilute fluorination of the top layer lifts the valley degeneracy of the confined states and attenuates the orbital magnetic dipole moments due to current circulation within the flake . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the spin - orbit coupling introduced by the surface deformation of the top layer induced by the adatoms allows spin flips to be driven by the ac electric field . for the bilayer quantum dots </S>",
    "<S> the spin flip times is substantially shorter than the experimental spin relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical effects including many - photon and multilevel transitions are also discussed . </S>"
