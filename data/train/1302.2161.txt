    "<S> a defining feature of many unconventional fermi superfluids and superconductors is the existence of lines or points on the fermi surface where the energy gap vanishes and so - called `` nodal quasi - particles '' can exist at arbitrarily low energies . in fermi systems with such nodal quasi - particles </S>",
    "<S> the low temperature specific heat will show particular power law behaviours as a function of temperature . </S>",

    "<S> these were subsequently clarified further @xcite and are now widely used to identify pairing states in unconventional superconductors @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that gap nodes in superconductors can occur in a number of more general types than simply the usual line or point zeros and that each of these has a corresponding thermodynamic signature , typically in the form of non - integer power laws in low temperature specific heat . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that these anomalous power laws generically occur at points in the phase diagram where there is a topological change in the line or point nodal structure on the fermi surface , which we illustrate with a specific example : the noncentrosymmetric superconductors li@xmath0pd@xmath1pt@xmath2b . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the gap node topological changes are also associated with changes of bulk topological quantum numbers for the quasi - particles . </S>",
    "<S> the future experimental observation of such non - integer power laws could therefore be used to identify not only superconductors with highly unconventional pairing symmetries , but also topological superconducting and superfluid systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar physics are realised in the high - temperature cobalt doped pnictide materials ba(fe@xmath4t@xmath2)@xmath0as@xmath0 ( t = co , ni , pd ) @xcite .    for the usual types of point and line </S>",

    "<S> the heat capacity at this critical point is a power law , with @xmath19 rather than the usual @xmath11 for point nodes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this aspect of non - linear excitation spectra was identified by leggett in his review of the superfluid phases of @xmath20he @xcite , though at the time no examples were known . </S>",
    "<S> later a ground state with e@xmath21 symmetry having this feature was proposed for the heavy - fermion superconductor upt@xmath14 @xcite and possible thermal transport signatures were discussed @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that this different type of point node behaviour is not restricted to certain special symmetries but occurs generically when the gap structure is changing from having a point node to having no nodes , as a function of some parameter defining the pairing potential on the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> we extend this notion to a much wider class of nodal types and node topology transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that it is possible to continuously remove a point node of the gap is surprising , since the usual linear spectrum point node behaviour is usually thought to be topologically stable against perturbations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the shallow node behaviour is not topologically protected , since it only occurs for specific parameter values in which accidental cancellations occur between different order parameter components . nevertheless , as we shall see its influence extends throughout the finite - temperature phase diagram .    </S>",

    "<S> , this type of shallow line node only occurs at a boundary between a nodeless superconductor and one with ordinary line nodes , as discussed recenly for the pnictide superconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , both nodal and nodeless compounds of the system ba(fe@xmath4co@xmath25)@xmath26as@xmath26 have been reported @xcite , suggesting that the @xmath24 power law could be observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> this would provide compelling evidence for the @xmath27 gap model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another type of nodal behaviour occurs when there is a crossing or topological reconnection of line nodes . </S>",
    "<S> these again lead to distinctive low temperature power laws , with non - integer power law exponents . </S>",
    "<S> a crossing of linear line nodes is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : points_lines_nodal_crossings ] ( e ) . </S>",
    "<S> this type of crossing can occur in a d - wave superconductor , for example @xmath28 , in the case where the fermi surface is spherical rather than cylindrical . </S>",
    "<S> although the node crossing point occurs for a small portion of the fermi surface , it turns out that this point dominates the low temperature heat capacity , and such crossings can therefore be detected experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the density of states resulting from the node crossing has a logarithmic term . </S>",
    "<S> this logarithmic term approximates a power law at low temperatures , and leads to a specific heat capacity contribution approximately of the form @xmath29 , which at low enough temperatures dominates over the usual line node contribution @xmath30 arising from the line nodes away from the crossing . unlike the shallow point node </S>",
    "<S> , the crossing of line nodes is expected to be topologically protected against small perturbations .    the final distinct type of gap node which we shall discuss is a crossing of shallow line nodes , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : points_lines_nodal_crossings ] ( f ) . </S>",
    "<S> again this leads to a logarithmic term in the density of states , which dominates the low temperature behaviour compared to the shallow line node case in the absence of crossings . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding specific heat capacity is approximately @xmath31 for the shallow line node crossing , compared to @xmath32 for the case without crossings . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , @xmath33 is not so far from the value obtained for the ungapped fermi surface of a normal ( non - superconducting ) fermi liquid , @xmath34 .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : exponent_plot ] shows the predicted exponents of the power law temperature dependences of specific heat for each of the different nodal types shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : points_lines_nodal_crossings ] . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> the predicted power law behaviour @xmath35 is accurate at very low temperatures , below @xmath36 , and in many cases the low temperature power laws apply over a range of temperatures up to @xmath37 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : points_lines_nodal_crossings ] and [ fig : exponent_plot ] are given in appendix [ sec : methods ] .    </S>",
    "<S> non - integer power laws , especially powers below @xmath38 , are a highly distinctive signature of the low energy excitation spectrum , and their experimental observation would be a relatively clear and direct form of evidence for the existence of the corresponding type of gap node in a given material . in systems where the gap topology is changing as a function of some experimental parameter ( e.g.  doping or spin - orbit coupling ) these anomalous powers will only be observed to the lowest temperatures if the material is exactly at the critical parameter value for the shallow node to occur . however , </S>",
    "<S> if the material is merely near to , not exactly at , the critical parameter value , then the shallow node power laws will hold over a wide temperature range , reverting to ordinary line , point , or nodeless behaviour at the very lowest temperatures . again </S>",
    "<S> experimental observation of such a cross - over between power laws would be a clear signature of the unusual gap nodal structure - we provide an explicit example of this below . in practice , it is unlikely that the power laws shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> fig : topology_plot_c ] ( inset ) , discussed below , is more feasible as a function of doping at constant temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the _ ad hoc _ mechanisms mentioned above , we expect shallow line or point nodes to occur generically in superconductors with multi - component order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> consider the simple model shown in fig . [ fig : multi_param ] . </S>",
    "<S> this shows a hypothetical system , such as an ordinary s - wave bcs superconductor with a significant level of anisotropy in the gap . </S>",

    "<S> where @xmath42 the gap is nodeless everywhere on the fermi surface . on the other hand , if @xmath43 then the gap changes sign at some points on the fermi surface , leading to pairs of line nodes . at the critical parameter value @xmath44 the line node pairs coalesce , leading to a single , shallow , line node . in this example </S>",
    "<S> no symmetry change occurs in the gap function , </S>",
    "<S> however `` accidental '' line nodes occur within a single symmetry of the cooper pair order parameter , because of the large degree of gap anisotropy .    </S>",
    "<S> an explicit example of this mechanism by which anomalous power laws may be observed is provided by non - centrosymmetric superconductors where the superconductor order parameter @xmath45 has singlet and triplet components @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively , such as the compounds li@xmath26pd@xmath1pt@xmath25b  @xcite . </S>",
