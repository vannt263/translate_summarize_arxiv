    "sol - gel method ( pechini ) was used to prepare nanotube and nanoparticle samples .",
    "the main difficulty of this method for nanocrystalline multicomponent oxides is to control of the stoichiometry at nanoscopic level and in this work we could overcame this difficulty . for the synthesis , we used analytical grade samarium nitrate ( sm(no@xmath8)@xmath86h@xmath9o ) , strontium carbonate ( srco@xmath8 ) and manganese acetate ( mn(ch@xmath8coo)@xmath94h@xmath9o ) weighted accurately ; and then these were dissolved into nitric and citric acid solution in de - ionized water .",
    "the solution were mixed to obtain a clear solution with molar ratio of sm : sr : mn=0.6:0.4:1 .",
    "a suitable amount of polyethylene glycol was added to the solution as polymerizing agent . in order to evaporate the excess of solvents and to promote polymerization ,",
    "the solution was submitted to 343 k for 6 h and then a yellow transparent viscous solution was obtained .",
    "a part of the solution was heated in a furnace for 8h at 973 k and a final black sm@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath8 powder was obtained .",
    "the deposition of nanotubes were made in ordered porous alumina with 200 nm of diameter for 2 h in vacuum ( pore wetting technique ) and treated for 8 h at 973 k. the bulk sample were prepared by conventional solid - state reaction from stoichiometric amounts of sm@xmath9o@xmath8 ; srco@xmath8 , and mn@xmath9o@xmath8 .",
    "the powders were ground , mixed and then calcined in air at 1373 k for 24 h. the resulting powder was reground , pressed into pellets , and then sintered at 1623 k during 36 h.    x - ray powder diffraction data were obtained at room temperature , using a bruker axs d8 advance diffractometer with cu - k@xmath10 radiation ( @xmath11 = 1.54056  ) for nanostructures , and with fe - k@xmath10 ( @xmath11 = 1.936087  ) for bulk sample .",
    "data were collected in the 15@xmath12 < 2@xmath13 < 85@xmath12 range in a bragg - brentano geometry , with a step size of 0.02@xmath12 and a counting time of 0.1 s per step . to confirm the formation of the nanotubes , high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) technique was employed . for these analysis",
    "the samples were diluted in alcohol .",
    "magnetic measurements was carried out using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction of the nanostructures and bulk are shown in the fig.[drxtodos ] ; the results confirm the formation of pure sm@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath8 crystalline phase ( space group _ pnma _ ortorhombic system ) .",
    "those data were refined by the rietveld method ( bottom of fig .",
    "[ drxtodos ] ) and the crystallographic parameters and reliability factors obtained are into table [ crystaldata ] and are in good agreement with previous results @xcite . using the scherrer equation@xcite was possible to estimate the average particle diameter @xmath14 from the nanoparticle and nanotube ( note the nanotube wall is composed of nanoparticles ) which are 29 nm and 15 nm , respectively ( table [ crystaldata ] ) .    .refined crystallographic data and reliability factors for sm@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 nanoparticle , nanotube and bulk samples .",
    "the nanoparticle size @xmath14 obtained by the x - ray and hrtem are also presented.[crystaldata ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to confirm the formation of the nanotubes , hrtem image were done . in figure [ tem](a ) it is possible to see the nanotube diameter of c.a .",
    "200 nm , while figure [ tem](b ) shows the image of a single nanoparticle that composes the nanotube wall .",
    "note the nanotube is formed by an assembly of nanoparticles with average diameter of @xmath15 nm .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the obtained value by xrd refinement data ( @xmath16 nm - see table [ crystaldata ] ) .",
    "due to the different morphology of the prepared samples , as detailed before , it is highly expected a different magnetic behavior for those samples ; and indeed it was found , as shown on figure [ mxttodos]-(a ) , that presents the magnetization curves as a function of temperature for all samples .",
    "data were collected in zero field cooled ( zfc ) and field cooled ( fc ) regimes .",
    "it is possible to observe that the bulk sample shows a thermal hysteresis , as expected and observed in other works@xcite , in which is a signature of first - order magnetic transition . on the other hand , magnetization of nanoparticles and nanotubes , without thermal hysteresis close to @xmath17 , presents a peak around 50 k , which is characteristic of superparamagnetic ( spm ) systems , and , in addition , the curve is broader than that one of the bulk .",
    "this result indicates that the magnetocaloric potential curve ( @xmath18 s ) for nanostructures will be wider .",
    "moreover , figure [ mxttodos]-(a ) shows that the magnetization value at low temperature is very different for all samples , which can be better understood analyzing the magnetization as a function of applied magnetic field at 4 k ( see figure [ mxttodos]-(b ) ) .",
    "we can see that the nanostructures do not saturate completely in fields up to 50 koe , but using the m _ vs _ 1/h curves ( not shown ) , it was possible to obtain the saturation magnetization of 0.4 @xmath19 , 2 @xmath19 and 3.6 @xmath19 for the nanotube , nanoparticle and bulk , respectively .",
    "note the magnetization in high magnetic field decreases by decreasing the size of the nanostructure due to the increasing of the surface / volume ratio ; and this behavior was already noted in other works@xcite .",
    "the magnetic state of the nanoparticle surface is different from the core ( volume ) , and in fact it is still a point of discussion : some researchers claim that manganite nanoparticles have a surface with ferrimagnetic order @xcite ; other groups focus on the magnetically dead surface @xcite and some other works argue that the surface presents only a canting effects @xcite . in spite of this divergence about the magnetic arrangement on the nanoparticle surface , all the works agree that the surface plays a fundamental role in the saturation magnetization .",
    "in addition , in what concerns the superparamagnetic evidences in the nanostructured sample , we used a simple criterion for analyzing such behavior : according to bean and livingston @xcite , a system can be considered superparamagnetic if @xmath20 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath21 for several temperatures overlap around @xmath22 ; and indeed this occurs , as can be seen in figure [ mxttodos]-(c ) .",
    "other works indeed agree with this assumption@xcite .    , width=226 ]    , width=219 ]    , width=211 ]    magnetization as a function of temperature for different applied magnetic fields are shown in figure [ mxtvsh ] for ( a ) bulk , ( b ) nanoparticles and ( c ) nanotubes .",
    "the magnetic entropy change was determined from the isothermals ( m versus h curves transposed of the m(t ) presented in figure [ mxtvsh ] ) using the integral version of a maxwell relation@xcite : @xmath23 the obtained magnetic entropy change are shown in figure [ emc ] for ( a ) bulk , ( b ) nanoparticles and ( c ) nanotubes , for @xmath18h = 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 and 50 koe .",
    "note indeed one of the goal of this work was reached , since we could make broader the magnetic entropy change of this highlighted sm@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 manganite by producing nanoparticles . in other words , this quantity changes from a sharp a - shape , for the bulk sample , to a much more smoothing curve , for the nanoparticles . in what concerns the nanotubes ,",
    "note a undesired m - shape profile was found and it is directly related to the nanoparticle size ( 25 nm ) that composes the nanotube wall ( in contrast to the 29 nm particle size of the pure nanoparticle sample ) .",
    "we mean , it depends on the nanoparticle size because for this case ( nanotube ) , superparamagnetic behavior is more pronounced ( note the valley occurs at the blocking temperature at 50 k ) .",
    "other important issue is the character of the magnetic transition . as can be seen in figure [ arrotplot ] , which shows the arrott plot , the bulk curves present a negative slope ( @xmath24 parameter of the landau expansion@xcite ) , for low values of magnetization , which indicates a first - order magnetic transition according to banerjee s criterion @xcite ; while the two nanostructured samples present a positive @xmath24 parameter , i.e. , transition of second - order character according to same criterion .",
    "the bulk suffers a first - order magnetic transition at @xmath25 coupled to a volume change ( @xmath26 ) of 0.1 % @xcite , which becomes second order as particle decreases .",
    "we should remember that the nanoparticle is composed of two different parts ; the inner is a core where double exchange interaction dominates and promotes ferromagnetic behavior .",
    "the outer part is a layer where magnetic interactions are clearly modified by defects , vacancies , stress , and broke bonds directing to a disordered magnetic state .",
    "hueso et al .",
    "@xcite argues that the center part always retains the intrinsic first - order magnetic transition of the bulk compound , while the disordered outer layer is more likely to undergo a second - order transition , from the disordered state into the paramagnetic .",
    "the composition of both transition hides the presence of the first - order one . in this way , the overall result in the smallest particles is a second - order transition , although both contribution should be present at the same time .",
    "thus , the aim of this paper was reached by producing nanostructure of the sm@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 by using a sol - gel modified method .",
    "in addition , the magnetic transition of the nanostructure was smoothed , and , thus , the magnetic entropy change curve is wider , instead of a sharp a - shape of the bulk sample . however , a drawback arose : the magnitude of the effect , that decreases from 8.2 j / kg.k for the bulk sample down to 1.2 j / kg.k for the nanoparticles ( at 50 koe of magnetic field change ) .",
    "this decreasing is associated to the decreasing of magnetic saturation , as discussed before ( see figure [ mxttodos]-bottom - left ) .",
    "indeed , it is not as bad as it seems , because the important quantity for magnetocaloric applications is the relative cooling power ( rcp ) ; i.e. , the maximum value of magnetic entropy change times the full width at half maximum .",
    "thus , the rcp for the bulk sample is 246 j / kg , while it is 132 j / kg for the nanoparticle ; and are therefore comparable . some final words : the decreasing of the maximum magnetic entropy change for the nanoparticles is associated to the decreasing of magnetic saturation , as discussed before ( see figure [ mxttodos]-bottom - left ) .",
    "bulk , nanoparticles and nanotubes of sm@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath8 manganites were successfully produced by the modified sol - gel method .",
    "the structural properties were investigated by the drx and hrtem techniques , which showed that nanoparticles and nanotubes present average diameter of 29 and 200 nm , respectively .",
    "in addition , we also could determine that nanotube wall is composed of nanoparticles with average diameter of 25 nm .",
    "magnetization measurements reveled a possible superparamagnetic behavior of these nanostrucutres due to the merged m _ vs _",
    "h / t curves . in addition , in this work was possible to make broader the magnetic entropy change curve of the highlighted manganite . more precisely , this quantity changes from a sharp a - shape ( bulk ) to a much broader curve ( nanoparticle ) , covering c.a .",
    "110 k ( full width at half maximum ) .",
    "however , for nanostructures the maximum of magnetic entropy change is significantly lower than the bulk due to suppression of first - order magnetic transition by nanostructuring .",
    "on the other hand , nanotubes , constituted of smaller nanoparticles ( 25 nm ) , have the superparamagnetic character much more pronounced and , as a consequence , this material has an undesired m - shape magnetic entropy change curve .",
    "thus , this work contributes by ( i ) improving the sol - gel method for producing manganites nanoestructured ( ii ) providing a broader and useful magnetic entropy change and ( iii ) pointing out the existence of a threshold size particle , below which the magnetocaloric features lack utility .",
    "further works to improve this effect is to ( i ) prepare advanced nanomaterials shell - protected , i.e. , magnetic nanoparticles with magnetic shell and ( ii ) determine the threshold nanoparticle size to avoid superparamagnetic character .",
