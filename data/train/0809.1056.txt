    "the problem of finding the ground state of a many - particle hamiltonian is , in general , a daunting task .",
    "the problem is most severe in the case of fermionic particles , where the infamous fermion sign problem plagues solutions via numerical methods .",
    "in contrast , in bosonic systems , monte carlo methods are rather efficient in simulating systems of reasonably large sizes .",
    "certain methods , such as density matrix renormalization group , avoid the sign problem , but are mainly restricted to 1d or quasi-1d systems .",
    "in this paper we step back from the problem of determining the ground state of a given many - body hamiltonian , and instead pose the following question : fixing the kinetic energy part of the hamiltonian , can a _ given _ wavefunction be the ground state for _ some _ choice of potential energy ? put simply , we ask if the wavefunction is _",
    "groundstatable_. the question is trivial to answer for bosonic system , as we discuss below , but in the case of fermions it is much more difficult and subtle .",
    "to illustrate this idea , let us start with a very simple example : the case of a single spin @xmath0 degree of freedom .",
    "consider a hamiltonian of the form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the usual spin - flip operator and @xmath3 is a diagonal operator in the @xmath4 basis . here",
    ", we will not specify @xmath3 and try to diagonalize @xmath5 ; instead , we will consider the wavefunction @xmath6\\ ] ] and ask what the condition is on @xmath7 so that @xmath8 is the ground state of @xmath5 , for some a proper choice of @xmath3 . to answer that , the first step is to make @xmath8 an eigenstate of @xmath5 by imposing @xmath9 ( so @xmath8 is an eigenstate of @xmath5 with energy zero ) .",
    "the expression of @xmath3 follows immediately and we can rewrite @xmath5 in a matrix form as : @xmath10 the two eigenvalues of this problem are @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "now , it is easy to see that @xmath13 will be the ground state of @xmath5 if and only if @xmath14 ( _ i.e. _ if the wavefunction elements are all positive ) .",
    "we will say that @xmath8 is _ groundstatable _ for @xmath14 . on the contrary ,",
    "when @xmath15 , @xmath8 is an excited state of the problem and no longer groundstatable . at the boundary between the two cases , one component of the wavefunction",
    "vanishes at @xmath16 .",
    "then , the potential energy blows up and the eigenvalue @xmath17 goes from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "of course , the property of groundstatability for a given wavefunction is directly related to the kinetic energy operator we have considered .",
    "had we chosen a different operator , we would have reached a different conclusion on @xmath7 .",
    "the point is that once this operator is fixed , the problem is uniquely defined .",
    "this approach to the single spin hamiltonian can be extended to a many - body problem , where the kinetic energy is often chosen to be a local hopping operator between nearby sites .",
    "then , from the set of all possible many - body wavefunctions , some are groundstatable and others are not .",
    "it is of crucial importance to establish in which category a given wavefunction belongs to , since it determines if this state is allowed in nature . in general , for a given kinetic energy term , the hilbert space is broken down in regions in which the wavefunction satisfies groundstatability ; as we will see below , the level of complexity of the partitions of the space into such regions is closely related to the presence or the absence of a sign problem in the hamiltonian .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : problem ] we define the problem of groundstatability on a finite dimensional hilbert space and we show how it can be solved on a particular case where the hamiltonian admits a product form .",
    "then , we present in section [ sec : many - body ] the main part of our work , namely how one can build a hamiltonian for which a given many - body fermionic wavefunction is the groundstate",
    ". the numerical procedure is also detailed in that section .",
    "results are shown in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we discuss the case of the wavefunction for non - interacting fermions which allows us to illustrate the loss of groundstatability in these systems .",
    "we then present the potentials obtained from mean - field solutions of the hubbard model , bcs superconductors and spin - density waves ( sdw ) .",
    "these results are in accordance with mean - field analysis . by considering additional jastrow factors",
    ", we also examine partially - projected bcs wavefunctions relevant for the study of high-@xmath20 superconductors .",
    "finally , a more open problem , with a class of wavefunctions containing both superconductivity and antiferromagnetism , is investigated .",
    "let us consider a finite dimensional matrix example . take a hamiltonian matrix @xmath21 , where @xmath22 index the states in the @xmath23-dimensional hilbert space , for example the spatial configurations of fermions on a finite lattice .",
    "suppose that the off - diagonal elements @xmath24 are known , and one wants to determine if the vector ( state ) with components @xmath25 can be the ground state if the matrix elements in the diagonal are properly picked .",
    "there are two steps in the problem : the first is trivial , to make @xmath26 an eigenstate , and the second is the problem we pose , whether it can be _ the _ ground state .",
    "we start by determining the diagonal elements from the condition that @xmath26 is an eigenstate . for simplicity , we shift again the eigenvalue @xmath27 to zero , and solve for the @xmath23 variables @xmath28 in the diagonal : @xmath29 so the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath30 \\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a sum of projector operators acting on a 2-dimensional subspace of states @xmath22 ( one can check that the operator within brackets squares to a multiple of itself ) .",
    "the problem of groundstatability is that it is not guaranteed , with the hamiltonian @xmath31 now determined , that @xmath32 is _ the _ ground state , and not an excited state .",
    "what are the conditions on the vector components @xmath25 for it to be the ground state ?",
    "if the off - diagonal matrix elements are all non - positive , then one can make use of the perron - frobenius theorem and the well - known connection to stochastic dynamics  @xcite , or alternatively cast the hamiltonian as a sum of positive semi - definite projectors  @xcite . basically , the condition of groundstatability in this case is that @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "this is the case of matrix hamiltonians for bosonic systems , and the strictly negative or zero off - diagonal elements is related to the absence of a sign - problem in the hamiltonian .",
    "the problem of the single spin @xmath0 mentioned in the introduction falls in this category .",
    "now , one does not have the luxury of the stochastic mapping to a problem with positive probabilities in general .",
    "if some off - diagonal elements of the hamiltonian are non positive , we lack any general theorem to conclude on the groundstatability of the wavefunction .",
    "sometimes , it is possible to find a gauge transformation to come back to the simpler case with all strictly negative or zero off - diagonal elements ; this happens for some spin models , like the anti - ferromagnetic heisenberg hamiltonian , where the sign structure of the ground state is given by the marshall rule  @xcite .",
    "however , in fermionic problems and some frustrated magnets , the problem remains unsolved .      before going to our main case of interest which is the fermionic hamiltonian with neighboring site hopping for kinetic energy term",
    ", we would like to present another class of models where the question of groundstatability can be completely and analytically answered even in the absence of a marshall - like rule .",
    "the problem of groundstatability is defined for a given choice of kinetic energy operator , and we will choose here the off - diagonal elements of the hamiltonian @xmath35 to be separable into products of @xmath36 . notice that these models are highly non - local problems .",
    "however , they are interesting because they display the fundamental difference between the presence / absence of a sign problem in the system , mainly , the parameter space can be separated into disconnected groundstatable regions in the @xmath37 case , whereas in the @xmath38 case the groundstatable region is just made of a single block .",
    "let us consider the two possibilities : @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "now , given a vector @xmath25 , we construct the diagonal elements according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : diagonal ] ) so that @xmath25 is an eigenvector with eigenvalue zero .",
    "the schrdinger equation for any eigenstate @xmath41 with energy @xmath42 reads : @xmath43 and it is then straightforward to show that all eigenvalues @xmath42 are solutions of the equation : @xmath44 @xmath45 is indeed , by construction , a solution .",
    "the state @xmath26 is the ground state if all other solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pole - eq ] ) are positive .",
    "it follows that solutions of @xmath46 satisfy @xmath47 if all poles of the function @xmath48 are positive , and solutions of @xmath49 satisfy @xmath47 if one and only one of the poles of the function @xmath50 is negative ( see figure [ fig : poles ] ) .    ) ( circles ) for a three dimensional hilbert space when @xmath51 is the ground state energy .",
    "notice the positions of the poles with respect to zero in the two cases . ]",
    "notice that in the ( @xmath52 ) case , to fix the poles of @xmath48 to be positive , the signs of groundstatable vectors @xmath25 are related to those of @xmath53 , and one can thus write @xmath54 , which is a simple example of a marshall sign . in this case , the signs of the @xmath53 s can be gauged away from the hamiltonian , bringing it to the form that satisfy the perron - frobenius theorem : @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the condition for groundstatability in the ( @xmath57 ) case is richer .",
    "the condition that one and only one of the poles of the function @xmath50 is negative leads to @xmath23 distinct sectors in the hilbert space , each sector corresponding to the choice of which of the @xmath23 poles is selected to be the negative one .",
    "more explicitly , the condition on the poles is equivalent , for @xmath58 , to : @xmath59 each of these inequalities split the hilbert space into two pieces via a hyperplane , and the @xmath23 conditions lead to a simplex , and the choices of the @xmath60 to @xmath23 such simplexes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : simplex ] for simple examples on @xmath61 hamiltonians ) .",
    "is groundstatable : we fix @xmath62 , and show the regions in the @xmath63 plane where the wavefunctions are groundstatable .",
    "( @xmath52 ) @xmath64 ( frobenius case ) and ( @xmath57 ) @xmath65 ( non - frobenius case ) , for @xmath66 . ]    in most of the cases , the edges of the simplexes correspond to the vanishing of one of the @xmath67 in the wavefunction .",
    "indeed , coming from a groundstatable region , if one component @xmath25 changes sign the inequalities ( [ eq : inequal ] ) are violated . on the edge , @xmath68",
    ", the associated diagonal element @xmath28 is infinite [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : diagonal ] ) ] and one of the positive eigenvalues diverges towards @xmath18 and reappears at @xmath19 .",
    "another edge is given by the equation @xmath69 .",
    "in this case , the whole hamiltonian is reduced to the projector @xmath70 ( this corresponds to the diagonal line on fig . [",
    "fig : simplex ] ) and there are only two eigenvalues : @xmath71 and @xmath72 . from this point of view , boundaries between groundstatable and non - groundstatable either corresponds to ill - defined hamiltonians or to highly degenerate problems , the first case being the most common one .    for a hamiltonian with off - diagonal matrix elements that can not be separated into a product as in the example above",
    ", the situation is more complicated .",
    "nonetheless , one should expect that the feature we encountered in the simple case study should remain : generically the set of groundstatable wavefunctions within the hilbert space is largely fragmented into regions . in the case of the example , there are order @xmath23 , the dimension of the hilbert space , regions .",
    "this is to be contrasted to the case where there is no fermion sign problem , where there is one single region .",
    "this fragmentation of the groundstatable set should be a generic feature of systems with fermionic sign problems .",
    "moreover , we also expect the diagonal part of the hamiltonian to abruptly change form when it leaves a groundstatable region and to become singular at the boundary ( the edges of the simplexes ) .",
    "these abrupt changes in the hamiltonian can be used as telltales that the wavefunction , as function of some parameter , exits a groundstatable region .",
    "it is important to point out that , within a given groundstatable region , many phases of matter can exist .",
    "order parameters computed from a groundstatable wavefunction can be used to classify the phases .",
    "the groundstatable regions thus do not delimit single phases ; what they do demarcate are the regions where a wavefunction can possibly correspond to a state of matter , for a fixed kinetic energy term in the hamiltonian .",
    "let us now turn into a more practical application , and show how one can implement the procedure of finding the potential energy term for which a given fermionic many - body state @xmath73 is the ground state , given a kinetic energy .",
    "we will consider specifically the case where the kinetic energy comes from a tight - binding hopping term on a lattice , which is common in many strongly - correlated electronic problems .",
    "we consider the case of fermions on a square lattice , and detail below the numerical procedure used to evaluate the potential energy of the hamiltonian .    shifting the ground state energy to zero , the hamiltonian @xmath74 that we seek",
    "should satisfy    @xmath75    for all eigenstates @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath77 label the site and the spin of the fermions , respectively .",
    "( hereafter we set the energy scale @xmath78 . )",
    "the potential @xmath79 depends only on the fermionic occupation operators @xmath80 and is uniquely determined by the condition eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) provided @xmath26 is groundstatable .",
    "we will focus here on the general form of this potential , addressing the question of groundstatability for more specific cases .",
    "we treat this problem in the configuration basis @xmath81 , where a basis element stands for a set of positions of the @xmath82 fermions , say @xmath83 for the up spins and @xmath84 for the down spins .",
    "the anticommutation relations between fermionic operators also require enumerating the fermions and keeping the same ordering for each configuration .",
    "the action of the kinetic operator @xmath85 on an ordered configuration @xmath86 can be understood by introducing a configuration @xmath87 such that @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is another ordered configuration differing from @xmath86 by the local hopping of a single electron . if configuration @xmath87 is correctly ordered , @xmath31 is equal to @xmath90 , otherwise it is equal to @xmath91 .",
    "thus , to determine the sign of @xmath92 one has to consider the positions of all the fermions in @xmath86 and @xmath89 .",
    "this is the sign problem , which bedevils monte carlo simulations on the hubbard model in dimensions higher than one .    in this study",
    ", the fermionic many - body wavefunctions will take the form : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a jastrow factor that depends on the fermion occupation numbers in configuration @xmath86 , and @xmath95 is a @xmath96 matrix with elements that depend on the position of the particles in configuration @xmath86 , @xmath97_{lm}\\equiv\\varphi \\left(\\mathbf{r}_l^{\\ups}-\\mathbf{r}_m^{\\downs } \\right)$ ] , with @xmath98 a function characterizing the correlations between pairs of fermions@xcite .",
    "this form includes the wavefunction for non - interacting fermions , bcs and spin density wave ( sdw ) wavefunctions and also partial projections of these states @xcite . in the configuration basis , the potential @xmath79 reads : @xmath99 supposing there are no vanishing determinants",
    ". only neighboring configurations , defined so that @xmath86 and @xmath89 differ by the hopping of a single fermion , contribute to the sum . to evaluate the sum , rather than determining @xmath31 for each pair of configuration @xmath86 and @xmath89",
    ", we can use the fact that @xmath100 to rewrite the potential @xmath101 as a function of configurations @xmath87 : @xmath102 where the primed sum is over configurations @xmath87 that differ from @xmath86 by the hopping of a single electron .",
    "we then compute @xmath101 by calculating all the ratios @xmath103 which are easy to calculate since the matrices @xmath104 differ from @xmath105 by the modification of one row or one column , depending if an up or down spin hopped , respectively  recall that @xmath97_{lm}\\equiv\\varphi \\left(\\mathbf{r}_l^{\\ups}-\\mathbf{r}_m^{\\downs } \\right)$ ] .",
    "notice that , by working directly with the positions @xmath106 and @xmath107 , issues of orderings of configurations disappear from the problem .    to evaluate the operator @xmath79 , we first compute @xmath101 for a large number of configurations @xmath108 .",
    "the configurations are chosen according to their weight @xmath109 via a metropolis algorithm , using the inverse update method for fermionic monte carlo  @xcite .",
    "then , we search for the best two - body approximation to the interaction , neglecting three - body and higher order terms : @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "( notice that for fixed particle number the onsite potential can be written with @xmath112 , with a constant shift absorbed into @xmath113 . ) the coefficients @xmath114 are evaluated through a linear least square method ( lls ) and the best approximated solution is the one minimizing the sum of the squared residuals @xmath115 .",
    "this quantity can be related to the overlap @xmath116 between the wavefunction @xmath117 , ground state of @xmath5 , and the ground state @xmath118 of @xmath119 , as follows .",
    "using perturbation theory on @xmath120 , we can write the ( unormalized ) ground state wavefunction of @xmath119 as @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the eigenstates and eigenvalues of @xmath5 . the norm of this state , @xmath124 , can be related to the squared residuals @xmath125 : @xmath126 overlapping @xmath26 with the normalized state @xmath127 yields ( up to second order in perturbation theory in @xmath128 ) @xmath129 therefore the squared residuals @xmath130 which we obtain by approximating the potential energy @xmath131 by a two - body interaction are a measure of the overlap between the ground states of @xmath132 and its two - body approximation @xmath133 .",
    "the smaller @xmath134 , the closer the overlap is to @xmath72 .",
    "one can bound the overlap between the two wavefunctions by noticing that , even if the system is gapless , the excitation energy @xmath135 should be controlled by the finite size @xmath136 of the system , and thus if @xmath134 is found to be much smaller than @xmath137 , the overlap will remain close @xmath72 . in estimating the overlap hereafter , we use the worst case scenario that the system is gapless , with a wavevector @xmath138 for the lowest energy excitation .",
    "( in the computations of @xmath116 below , we assume linearly dispersing modes with a velocity of order unity . )",
    "we computed the potential and the associated overlap for several wavefunctions . in each case",
    ", we considered a tilted lattice of size @xmath139 with odd @xmath136 and periodic boundary conditions to avoid singularities of @xmath140-wave wavefunctions in reciprocal space @xcite .",
    "10000 sweeps are usually considered for equilibration .",
    "then , up to @xmath141 configurations are taken for the lls method .",
    "computations have been made for various system sizes ( @xmath142 ) at half filling ( @xmath143 ) . because one can always change the constant @xmath113 by a shift in all the coefficients @xmath114 , we add the additional constraint @xmath144 such that the last @xmath145 coefficients average to zero .",
    "we checked numerically that the results do not depend on that specific choice of @xmath146 .",
    "we would like to emphasize here the difference between our method and the traditional variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method .",
    "given a wavefunction @xmath147 , the vmc method provides an upper bound for the ground state energy of a hamiltonian @xmath148 , _",
    "i.e. _ , in vmc the hamiltonian is given , and a wavefunction is the target . by varying the parameters contained in @xmath149 , one can find the best choice which minimizes the energy and then compute other operator averages such as order parameters or correlations functions .",
    "however , it is also possible that the real ground state of the system is so different from @xmath149 that it can not be reached by a variation in the parameters .",
    "this systematic uncertainty is not encountered in our approach as the hamiltonian @xmath150 derives uniquely from @xmath73 , _",
    "i.e. _ , we inverted the target to be the hamiltonian and not the wavefunction .",
    "if @xmath151 is groundstatable , it is the ground state of @xmath150 by construction .",
    "the potential obtained from the lls expansion should give an adequate description of the hamiltonian when interactions are predominantly two - body .",
    "accordingly , when three - body and higher interactions are totally absent , it should reproduce the exact form of the hamiltonian . hence , to check the consistency of our method",
    ", we would like to begin with a fermionic system with only two - body interactions whose ground state is known exactly , and try to recover the hamiltonian starting from the wavefunction .",
    "unfortunately , we lack any exact results in two dimensions .",
    "so , we will preliminarily step back to the one dimensional case where exact results are known , and investigate systems of @xmath152 interacting fermions on a ring .",
    "an appropriate case is the hamiltonian with an inverse - square potential : @xmath153 depending on the value of @xmath42 , the potential can be either attractive ( @xmath154 ) or repulsive ( @xmath155 ) , @xmath156 corresponding to the non - interacting case .",
    "the ground state wavefunction of this hamiltonian has been found by sutherland @xcite to be of the product form @xmath157    let us now apply our procedure to the wavefunction ( [ eq : sutherland ] ) .",
    "the configuration basis is the set of positions of @xmath152 spinless fermions on a ring of size @xmath136 . for @xmath108 configurations @xmath158 , we calculate @xmath101 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : diagonal ] ) and then perform the lls method .",
    "we do not have to worry about groundstatability here , since the wavefunction is always the groundstate for any @xmath42 .",
    "the potential energy we obtain is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sutherland ] for different values of @xmath42 , @xmath159 and @xmath141 .",

    "indeed , the precise dependence of the potential energy on the distance is found in quantitative agreement with that in the hamiltonian  [ eq : h - sutherland ] , with our method returning an exponent @xmath163 for the power law decay shown in fig .",

    "note the difference with a phase transition , where it is the wavefunction which displays singular behavior at a critical point as the hamiltonian is smoothly varied ; here the problem is inverted , as it is the hamiltonian that is singular at the boundary of the groundstatable region as the wavefunction is smoothly varied",

    "therefore , we are able to find an adiabatic path between the bcs state and the sdw state . in contrast , for @xmath260 to @xmath198 , we face a phase transition near @xmath261 ; this transition is probably first - order , given 1 ) the sharpness in the drop of the fidelity , and 2 ) the fact that the states at @xmath262 are the same ( they differ by an overall sign of the wavefunction ) and thus can not be separated by a second order transition . this particular evolution is peculiar to the mixtured considered in ( [ eq : bcs - sdw ] ) .",

    "the evolution of the order parameters as function of @xmath182 are presented in figure [ fig : order ] .",
    "let us first discuss the evolution of the af order parameter .",
    "starting from @xmath182 large and negative , the magnetization steadily increases from zero .",
    "it then displays a maximum at @xmath265 and finally decreases back to zero for @xmath182 large and positive .",
    "so we find that the maximum of the magnetization does not correspond to the pure sdw state but rather to the sdw state with small additional bcs correlations .",
    "the study of the superconducting order is also very interesting : @xmath266 is maximum for large values of @xmath267 and it vanishes at @xmath268 as expected .",
    "but it also displays an unexpected local maximum at @xmath269 . in the range @xmath270 ,",
    "both superconductivity and magnetism are not competing but rather supporting each other .",
    "notice also that the state with @xmath271 and the pure sdw state share the same characteristics : they have the same value of @xmath263 and no bcs order at all . what does this corresponds to in terms of the hamiltonian ?",
    "turning back to fig .",
    "[ fig : mix ] , we see that the maximum of both orders corresponds to a potential with a short range repulsion and a long - range attraction . however , it is hard to draw a clear conclusion on this potential since the variation of the overlap @xmath116 is pretty large near @xmath269 .",
    "nonetheless , it appears that we can trust the results on the potential for @xmath272 where the overlap is still large .",
    "as we already discussed , this corresponds to a purely repulsive potential with a hubbard term larger than in the pure sdw case .",

    "in conclusion , although the question here posed of groundstatability of a given wavefunction for a fixed kinetic energy term is much harder to address in fermionic than in bosonic systems , there are cases where it can be answered concretely , and we gave examples in this paper . considering exact results such as the calogero - sutherland wavefunction in 1d , we were able with our method to recover the hamiltonian starting from the wavefunction . in 2d",
    ", we illustrated the problem of groundstatability on the guztwiller wavefunction , where by slightly deforming the fermi sea of a non - interacting fermion system , one can go from the groundstate to an excited state .",
    "then , we analyzed several mean - field wavefunctions with different types of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism .",
    "these wavefunctions appeared to be groundstatable as they can be obtained by a deformation of the guztwiller state without losing groundstatability in the process .",
    "starting from these wavefunctions , we obtained the potential for which these states are the exact ground states , and we showed that the two - body approximation to the potential appeared to be valid in a broad range of parameter space .",
    "we found both short - range and long - range interactions in the hamiltonian .",
    "finally , we discussed the case of two non - trivial cases : the partially projected guztwiller wavefunction and a state with a mixture of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism . in the latter",
    ", we were able to find a hamiltonian favoring both sc and af at the same time .",
    "the approach we follow , of constructing the hamiltonian starting from the wavefunction and kinetic term , should be useful in determining whether certain exotic states of matter  for example non - fermi liquids in two or higher dimensions , and rvb states  are permitted in nature .",
    "instead of guessing hamiltonians that would realize these states , one can algorithmically determined the target hamiltonian starting from a wavefunction and local kinetic terms .",

    "it is actually interesting to ask the reverse question , and find out the conditions on a function @xmath274 so that the determinant of a matrix constructed from this function corresponds to a many - body wavefunction built by creating particles in pairs .",

    "first , note that the matrices @xmath293 and @xmath294 are hermitian and thus diagonalizable : @xmath295 that the indices @xmath42 labeling the states and the eigenvalue are common can be seen as follows : @xmath296 and therefore @xmath297 is an eigenstate of @xmath298 with eigenvalue @xmath299 .",
    "indeed , we can actually pair up the eigenvalues of @xmath298 and @xmath300 : @xmath301 and @xmath302 .",
    "more precisely , we can write @xmath303 and @xmath304 , where @xmath305 .",

    "notice that if @xmath283 is a real function , and if the spectrum of @xmath293 is non degenerate , then its eigenvectors @xmath313 are necessarily real and one has @xmath314 .",
    "so to get a non trivial function @xmath315 , it is important that all eigenvalues of @xmath293 are degenerate ( except maybe at some particular point where @xmath316 ) , and the corresponding eigenvectors reside in an eigenspace @xmath317 of dimension 2 . for real @xmath98",
    "it is possible to write two orthonormal real eigenvectors in @xmath317 , which can then be used as real and imaginary parts of new orthogonal eigenvectors @xmath318 and @xmath319 .",

    "what do we need to make the spectrum of @xmath293 degenerate ?",
    "suppose the function @xmath323 has some symmetry .",
    "for instance , in the case of the bcs and sdw wavefunctions , one can check that @xmath324 is indeed a symmetry .",

    "finally , notice that if one assembles a function from a linear combination of two functions that satisfy the conditions above ( for example , a symmetry such as @xmath333 as in the bcs and sdw cases ) , then the resulting function also satisfy the conditions .",
    "in particular , the combination @xmath334 does lead to a good fermionic wavefunction ( built as in eq .",

    "<S> we pose the question of whether , once the kinetic energy is fixed , a candidate ground state is _ groundstatable or not_. the easiness to answer this question is strongly related to the presence or the absence of a sign problem in the system . </S>",
    "<S> when groundstatability is satisfied , it is simple to obtain the potential energy that will lead to such a ground state . as a concrete case study </S>",
    "<S> , we apply these ideas to different fermionic wavefunctions with superconductive or spin - density wave correlations and we also study the influence of jastrow factors . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy considered is a simple next nearest neighbor hopping term .    . </S>"
