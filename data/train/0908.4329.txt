    "this result show that polarisation is a good tool to constraint the cut - off in the power spectrum . in particular",
    "while the considerations based only on the cmb anisotropies indicate a cut - off , the joined anisotropy and polarisation data indicate limit on the cut - off .",
    "this is crucial while constraining quantum cosmologies based on cut - offs resulting them .",
    "the second , b - type polarisation , still remains unreachable observationally .",
    "however there is presently a huge effort to detect it . in particular mission like",
    "planck aims to detect this type of polarisation .",
    "if the b - type polarisation will be measured then amplitude of the tensor power spectrum can be determined . in case of slow - roll inflation",
    "this amplitude is given by @xmath170 because @xmath171 , the measurements of the b - type polarisation enable us to determine energy scale of inflation .",
    "therefore absolute values of parameters @xmath172 and @xmath56 can be found .",
    "this give us also restriction on the pre - bounce initial condition , in particular on @xmath52 .",
    "when different modes of perturbations interact one another then field becomes non - gaussian .",
    "this interaction can be produced by the potential of the scalar field , higher order corrections in the perturbative expansion or by the quantum gravitational effects .    in case of the gaussian field ,",
    "all its statistical properties are fully described by the two point function @xmath173 where @xmath174 is power spectrum given by eq .",
    "[ defpowerspect ] . in order to describe non - gaussian effects",
    "it is necessary to consider higher order correlation functions .",
    "the first contribution of non - linearity comes in tree - point function @xmath175 where @xmath176 is called bispectrum .",
    "in case of the gaussian field , this spectrum is equal zero .",
    "the primordial non - gaussianity , if present , could affect also the spectrum of cmb anisotropies leading to its non - gaussianity .",
    "present observations indicate however that cmb spectrum is nearly gaussian .",
    "this give us constraint on the cosmological models with a huge amount of nonlinearity .",
    "in particular , based on these observations , some quantum cosmological models can be constrained or even excluded .",
    "for example preliminary studies on non - gaussianity in lqc were performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in these studies ,",
    "non - gaussianity is produced by the specific scalar field potential not by the quantum gravity effects itself .",
    "however , this model gives an example of non - gaussianity production in the bouncing universe .",
    "it was shown that in this model , non - gaussianity is produced in the vicinity of the points @xmath177 and @xmath178 , where hubble factor reach its maximal value .",
    "another example of non - gaussianity production in the bouncing cosmology can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper production of the non - gaussianity at the matter bounce",
    "is considered and indicate that this form of non - gaussianity can be potentially distinguished from this produced during the inflationary phase .      when the length of the mode of perturbation approaching the planck scale then semi - classical approximation fails .",
    "the notion of continuous wave is missed and and fully quantum gravitational considerations have to be applied . therefore these so called transplanckian modes can not be studied with use of quantum field theory on curved spaces as it was done in the present paper .",
    "more adequate would be application of quantum field theory on quantum spaces as this studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ modesbounce ] we show evolution of the different length scales in the bouncing universe .        we see that modes with @xmath179 can be described by the semi - classical approximation .",
    "it is exactly the case considered in this paper .",
    "however when @xmath180 then new formulation has to be applied .",
    "this would lead to potentially new effects .",
    "however these transplanckian modes can decay before crossing the horizon during the inflation .",
    "then any signature of the quantum gravity effects can be lost .",
    "however investigations as this performed in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that effects of transplanckian modes can lead to potentially observational effects .",
    "if the quantum cosmologies can give imprints on cmb , then some of these effects could be seen also in the subsequent structures .",
    "the region of the low multipoles corresponds now to the largest visible distances in the universe .",
    "gravitational structures on these scales are called large scale structure ( lss )",
    ". therefore observations of the large scale structures are complementary to the observations of the low multipoles in cmb .",
    "these both methods were already applied to investigate effects of the bouncing cosmological scenario in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this",
    "paper authors predict oscillations in the power spectrum on the horizontal scales due to the bounce . however available observational data from e.g. sdss are still not sufficient to probe these effects .",
    "in this paper we have shown possible way to relate quantum cosmological models with astronomical observations .",
    "this method can be used to constraint models of the universe in the planck epoch .",
    "in particular we constrained barmero - immirzi parameter @xmath0 , critical density @xmath1 and parameter @xmath2 .",
    "however , present constraints are still very week and ambiguous .",
    "the part of this ambiguity can be removed by fixing the parameters of inflation ( @xmath172 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "parameter n is today fixed by the requirement of solving the horizon problem .",
    "then value of @xmath56 is determined from the amplitude of cmb anisotropies .",
    "however problem of horizon do not appear in the bouncing cosmologies .",
    "therefore at present we have fixed only relation between @xmath172 an @xmath56 but not the absolute values . in order to fix one of these parameters ,",
    "other observable has to be measured .",
    "the most promising is amplitude of tensor perturbations .",
    "these perturbations produce b - type polarisation in cmb . therefore , if this polarisation would be measured then parameters @xmath172 and @xmath56 can be fixed .",
    "this will enable us to perform less ambiguous constraint on the lqc parameters , in particular on @xmath181 .",
    "we have shown that phase of a bounce set proper initial conditions for inflation . moreover",
    "parameters of inflation depends only logarithmically on the pre - bounce initial conditions .",
    "subsequently we considered model of perturbations at the bounce and at the joined bounce+inflation phase .",
    "we showed that this second model can give explanation of the suppression of the low multipoles in cmb .",
    "moreover we have indicated that model is fully consistent and scale of the cut - off agree with the present size of horizon .",
    "this indicate that fine - tuning is not required to produce suppression on the horizontal scales .    beside the cosmological approach to constraint quantum gravity effects",
    "also other indirect methods are available .",
    "in particular astrophysical measurements of the lorentz symmetry violation .",
    "it is in principle possible to derive quantitative predictions about this effect directly from lqg .",
    "however process of derivation require construction of the semi - classical states , where unknown phenomenological parameters appear .",
    "since their values are unknown , predictive power of this approach is marginal .",
    "if these difficulties would be removed then this method can be complementary with the cosmological approach .",
    "also the quantum effects on the gravitational collapses gives possible way to constraint the lqg .",
    "here the results are less ambiguous , however it is harder to relate them with some astrophysical data .",
    "as we see the difficulties lies here on both theoretical and empirical side . without knowing the relation between the lqc and lqg we can treat parameters of this first rather as phenomenological .",
    "if these difficulties would not be overcome it will be hard to perform complementary constraints of the same parameters , based on different methods , e.g. observations of cmb and gamma ray bursts .",
