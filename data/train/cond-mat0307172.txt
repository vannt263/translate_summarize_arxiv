    "an unsolved problem in many - body physics is to augment numerical exact diagonalization , which is only feasible on comparatively small systems , so as to give the maximum information about the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we know from the renormalization group that only a few degrees of freedom , _ viz .",
    "_ those with low energies and long wavelengths , really matter .",
    "hence it should be possible in principle to discard the irrelevant parts of the hilbert space , but no method has been developed in real space for higher - dimensional , interacting lattice models . the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite is the only successful method to date , but it is limited to one - dimensional chains , or two - dimensional systems that can be forced into one dimension as strips.@xcite    to get more mileage out of density matrix - based renormalization group methods , surely we must develop a deep understanding of the structure of density matrices of the simplest possible systems , for which analytic results are available to guide us .",
    "therefore , it is appropriate to begin by considering the ground state of a one - dimensional chain of noninteracting spinless fermions described by a nearest - neighbour hopping hamiltonian @xmath3.\\ ] ] here we observe that , in one dimension , one has the same fermi sea ground state for a variety of translationally - invariant hamiltonians with hoppings to further neighbors , provided their dispersion relation is monotonic so that the fermi surface occurs at the same wavevector for a given filling .",
    "a ` block ' is then identified within this one - dimensional system by choosing @xmath1 sites that need not be contiguous , following which we can define the many - body density matrix @xmath0 of the block starting from the zero - temperature many - body wavefunction and tracing out all sites outside the chosen block of @xmath1 sites .",
    "the basis of this paper is the simple factorized nature of @xmath0 and its eigenfunctions , which we derived exactly for noninteracting ( spinless or spinfull ) fermions,@xcite by extending a technique introduced by chung and peschel@xcite .    in ref .",
    ", it was shown that many - particle density matrix eigenstates are built from a set of single - particle creation operators and eigenvalues , quite analogous to the energy eigenstates of a noninteracting system of fermions .",
    "for a block of @xmath1 sites cut out from a larger overall system , there are @xmath1 such _ pseudo - creation operators _ @xmath4 , and the block s hilbert space is therefore spanned by all @xmath5 products of the @xmath4 s .",
    "the density matrix of the block can be written as @xmath6 which is the exponential of a _ pseudo - hamiltonian _ given by @xmath7 with _ single - particle pseudo - energy spectrum _ @xmath8 .",
    "this paper is devoted entirely to noninteracting fermions , because the analytic results of ref .",
    "permit many calculations that could not be done by numerical brute force in an interacting case , or can be carried out only by quite different methods ( such as monte carlo ) .",
    "furthermore , our hypothetical renormalization or projection algorithm using dm truncation would first be applied to a well - understood system in which the low - energy excitations behave as noninteracting quasiparticles ( as in a fermi liquid or a @xmath9-wave superconducting phase ) .",
    "our imagined numerical method in such a system would extract renormalized pseudo - creation operators @xmath10 which are related to the single - particle operators @xmath11 in the same way that quasiparticle creation operators are related to bare fermion creation operators .",
    "the pseudo - dispersion relation for the renormalized @xmath12 is thus expected to scale in the same fashion as the pseudo - dispersion @xmath8 encoded in of the noninteracting fermions considered in this paper .    through the calculations in this paper we aim to understand the analytic structure of @xmath0 , and to begin to understand the quantitative errors due to truncation .",
    "this includes the question : what is the proper measure of error ?",
    "the most familiar measure , the retained fraction of total density matrix weight , does not seem to be the best measure of error , as evidenced by the small errors obtained in section  [ sect : cdmts ] for the calculations of the dispersion relation .",
    "another question to be investigated is whether  when we are severely truncating the hilbert space , and attempting only to obtain the low - energy excitations  the density matrix eigenstates are the optimal basis . as shown by the comparison in section  [ sect : cpwts ] , they are certainly superior to the other plausible basis ( plane waves ) .",
    "in section  [ sect : dmstructure ] , we summarize first our much improved understanding of the analytic structure of the density matrix for noninteracting fermions ( and by implication for any fermi liquid ) following from and , and elucidate the statistical - mechanical analogy between the density matrix eigenstates and the many - body states of a system of noninteracting spinless fermions . in section  [",
    "sect : oldresults ] , we summarize the important results which we obtained in ref .  , giving exact relationships between the block density matrix @xmath0 , the green function matrix @xmath13 restricted to the block , as well as their eigenstates and eigenvalues .",
    "then in section  [ sect : recipe ] , we develop the main ideas behind a _ operator - based density matrix ( dm ) truncation scheme _ based on the statistical - mechanical analogy described in section  [ sect : dmstructure ] .",
    "the relation between the single - particle density matrix eigenstates and single - particle energy eigenstates of a system of noninteracting spinless fermions also suggests how the distribution of single - particle pseudo - energies @xmath8 are expected to scale with the block size @xmath1 .",
    "numerically , a scaling relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath1 was found indeed , for the overall chain at various fillings @xmath2 .",
    "our analytical results from ref .",
    "shed light on this eigenvalue scaling in two ways .",
    "firstly , as in ref .  , they allow numerical study of the density matrix for system sizes so large that they would be inaccessible to any other techniques . secondly , the exact connection of the block density matrix @xmath0 to the block green function matrix @xmath13 gives hints about the eigenvalue distribution .",
    "all of these will be discussed further in section  [ sect : scaling ] , and the implications of the scaling behaviour of the single - particle pseudo - energies are discussed in section  [ sect : implications ] , where we derived the asymptotic behaviour , in the limit of infinite block sizes , of the largest density matrix weight and the truncated weight @xmath14 , which is the sum of weights of the density matrix eigenstates retained in the operator - based dm truncation scheme .    compared to the traditional density matrix truncation scheme used in the dmrg , our operator - based density matrix truncation scheme gives for the same number of density matrix eigenstates retained a slightly larger discarded weight @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : neps ] in section  [ sect : residue ] ) .",
    "this quantity gives a @xmath16 estimate as an upper bound  a worst case scenario  for the error incurred when computing the expectation of a most general observable .",
    "as with examples in numerical integration , the performance of an algorithm in integrating some classes of functions may be much better than that expected from the straightforward error analysis . in any case",
    ", we are not really interested in arbitrary observables , but rather , in the dispersion relation of elementary excitations , which we calculate in section  [ sect : cdmts ] .",
    "the results are highly encouraging : the dispersion relation calculated in the operator - based dm truncation scheme differ from the true dispersion relation by an amount much smaller than what is suggested by the discarded weight .    besides quasiparticle dispersion relations , real space correlation functions are also interesting quantities to calculate , and these invariably depend on the real space structure of the many - body ground state wavefunction . since this wavefunction is to be written in terms of the one - particle density matrix eigenfunctions , it is important to understand the real space structure of these as well .",
    "the one - particle density matrix eigenfunctions kept in our operator - based dm truncation scheme have spatial structures that are very similar to each other . in section",
    "[ sect : wavefunctionscaling ] we look into a representative one - particle density matrix eigenfunction , the pseudo - fermi eigenfunction , for each @xmath1 , and found that they also obey a universal scaling relation .",
    "then in section  [ sect : dm2pw ] , we check how well such a truncated basis of one - particle density matrix eigenfunctions can approximate the true single - particle wavefunction at the fermi level , which is a plane wave with wavevector @xmath17 .",
    "we find the approximation to be good even when less than one quarter of the one - particle density matrix eigenfunctions are kept .",
    "this is impressive , considering the fact that in the operator - based dm truncation scheme , the number of many - particle density matrix eigenstates thus represented by the one - particle density matrix eigenstates retained constitutes a miniscule fraction of the total number of density matrix eigenstates .",
    "finally , for systems where we know that the true single - particle wavefunctions are plane waves , it seems _ a priori _ plausible that a plane wave - based operator - based truncation scheme might outperform the operator - based density matrix truncation scheme .",
    "we look into this possibility in section  [ sect : cpwts ] , and find that while there are a few aspects in calculating the dispersion relation where the _ operator - based plane wave ( pw ) truncation scheme _ outperforms the operator - based dm truncation scheme , the overall performance of the pw scheme is inferior to the dm scheme .",
    "we then conclude in section  [ sect : conclusions ] by summarizing the important results obtained in this paper , and discuss where all these might fit into the numerical analysis of an interacting system .",
    "because the hamiltonian in conserves particle number , the eigenstates of @xmath0 have definite particle number , and may be grouped into various @xmath18-particle sectors , where @xmath19 .",
    "a consequence of our fundamental formulas and is that every eigenstate of @xmath0 has the form @xmath20 each eigenstate is specified by a list of _ pseudo - occupation numbers _",
    "@xmath21 , where @xmath22 for the factors contained in , and is zero otherwise .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding eigenvalue , the _ density matrix weight _ , is simply given by @xmath23,\\ ] ] where the quantity @xmath24 appearing in the exponent is the _ total pseudo - energy_. in terms of the single - particle pseudo - energies @xmath25 , the normalization constant of the density matrix in can be written as @xmath26,\\ ] ] where the summation is over all @xmath5 combinations of occupations .",
    "it is immediately clear from that the density matrix eigenstate of maximum weight corresponds to the minimum total pseudo - energy .",
    "this is obtained by setting @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 . in complete analogy to the real energy of a noninteracting system of fermions , we simply fill up the _ single - particle pseudo - energy levels ( pels ) _ from the lowest up to a _ pseudo - fermi level_. the maximum density matrix weight always turns out to occur with the block fractional filling that is closest to the bulk filling of the fermi sea ground state .",
    "more generally , the maximum - weight state in the @xmath18-particle sector is obtained by filling the states with the @xmath18 lowest single - particle pseudo - energies .",
    "finally , it is clear that the next - highest weights , or equivalently the next - lowest total pseudo - energies in the @xmath18-particle sector , are obtained by making particle - hole excitations involving the pels near to the last one filled .",
    "the above analogy may be extended to note that is exactly the density matrix that would be obtained ( see for example , ref .  ) at temperature @xmath31 if @xmath32 were the hamiltonian .",
    "the reciprocal of the normalization constant @xmath33 of @xmath0 in just corresponds to the grand partition function for the block of @xmath1 sites . among other things",
    ", this implies that @xmath34 , the average particle number in a particular pel , has the functional form of the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "we will actually apply this idea in a slightly different way , so as to relate the single - particle pseudo - energies @xmath8 for different block sizes .",
    "if we were dealing with an actual hamiltonian , the dispersion relation would imply a density of states which would be multiplied by the system size to obtain the actual distribution of states .",
    "our numerical scaling results in section  [ sect : eigscale ] confirm that pseudo - energies behave similarly to real energies .      in our earlier work@xcite we obtain an exact formula @xmath35_{ij}{{c_{i}^{\\dagger}}}{{c_{j}^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}}},\\ ] ] which , with , relates @xmath0 to the block green function matrix @xmath13 , whose matrix elements are @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 restricted to sites within the block . clearly becomes when the pseudo - hamiltonian is diagonalized .",
    "also , tells us that the quadratic form of @xmath32 in and @xmath13 are simultaneously diagonalizable .",
    "if we denote by @xmath39 the single - particle eigenstate of @xmath32 with eigenvalue @xmath8 , then @xmath40 is the eigenvector of @xmath13 with eigenvalue @xmath41 .",
    "the single - particle pseudo - energies are related to the eigenvalues of @xmath13 by @xmath42 or equivalently , @xmath43 i.e.  the eigenvalues of @xmath13 are the average pseudo - occupation numbers @xmath34 .",
    "note that we sometimes write @xmath44 to make explicit the dependence on block size @xmath1 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath8 are ordered from the most negative to the most positive values .",
    "another notable result that was derived in ref .",
    "is that @xmath45 along with and , comprises the final ingredients that allow numerical computation of the density matrix even in very large blocks . aside from the possibilities of truncation , through",
    "have completely reduced a @xmath46 diagonalization problem into a @xmath47 problem , a computational shortcut which allows numerical studies of large blocks .",
    "the analytical structure of hints at the proper design of a truncation scheme .",
    "the retained hilbert space of a block _ should not _ be the span of those density matrix eigenstates whose weight exceeds a cutoff . instead , we should implement a ` consistent ' truncation , such that the truncated hilbert space consists of exactly @xmath48 states , built from all combinations of @xmath49 pseudo - creation operators @xmath50 , ",
    ", @xmath51 , acting on a block ` vacuum state ' @xmath52 , and satisfying fermion anticommutation relations .    in the traditional density",
    "matrix - based truncation scheme used in dmrg , the recipe for truncation is to sort all density matrix weights in descending order , and then retain only the eigenstates associated with the weights that exceed a certain cut off .",
    "let us refer to this as the _ weight - ranked dm truncation scheme_. in light of our understanding of the structure of the many - body density matrix presented in this paper , we can see that the weight - ranked dm truncation scheme will certainly retain the eigenstate with maximum weight , the pseudo - fermi sea described in section  [ sect : dmstructure ] , along with eigenstates that are ` particle excitations ' , ` hole excitations ' and ` particle - hole excitations ' from the pseudo - fermi sea .",
    "if we arrange the entire collection of many - particle density matrix eigenstates into a state graph , then the state graph looks like a @xmath1-dimensional hypercubic lattice near the pseudo - fermi sea .",
    "what the weight - ranked dm truncation does in this state graph picture is to remove nodes , and in effect cut bonds , out from this hypercubic lattice , producing a subgraph that is much less connected and containing tenuous links .",
    "because of this , when the hamiltonian is projected onto the weight - ranked dm truncated basis , spurious interactions are introduced .",
    "we can apply the pseudo - energy analogy in choosing how to truncate , given the form of the density matrix .",
    "it is familiar , in the truncation used in fourier - space - based quantum renormalization groups , to discard all single - particle degrees of freedom except for a shell around the fermi surface . in the same way ,",
    "let us discard all operators @xmath53 as degrees of freedom , except those for which @xmath54 is less than some threshold @xmath55 .",
    "for all other @xmath53 , we ` freeze ' @xmath56 by setting @xmath56 to its ground state value @xmath57 this choice gives the maximum density matrix weight , among the eigenstates having any particular set of @xmath56 for the retained single - particle pseudo - energy levels .",
    "the spirit of this truncation scheme is similar to that used in quantum chemistry@xcite , except that the notion of a fermi surface is more fuzzy in atoms and molecules .",
    "the idea that truncation consists of decreasing the thickness of a shell of wavevectors around the fermi surface appeared in the original renormalization group for a quantum - mechanical solid - state problem ( anderson s poor man s",
    "rg for the kondo problem@xcite ) . this obvious notion",
    " that the action is around the fermi surface  necessarily appears in every effective form of truncation intended for a metal ( see for example , ref .   and ref .",
    ", among others ) . however , to our knowledge all such schemes used a basis of plane waves or of energy eigenstates .",
    "our variation uses pels in analogy to the use of energy eigenstates in these previous problems . deriving from the density matrix",
    ", it makes sense only in procedures that involving cutting a real - space block out of a larger system .    within this _ operator - based density matrix ( dm ) truncation scheme _ , we can define an effective hamiltonian for the truncated hilbert space , just by taking the matrix elements of the true hamiltonian between all the retained states . using an operator - based truncation",
    ", this will have a particularly clean form : first replace each creation operator @xmath58 by the equivalent combination of all @xmath11 ; then replace @xmath59 for each single - particle pseudo - energy @xmath60 ( these are frozen to be always occupied ) , and otherwise remove all terms involving the operators that are truncated .",
    "thus , if the original hamiltonian has at most @xmath49-fermion terms , the same will be true for the truncated hamiltonian .",
    "this prescription shows that such a truncation is possible for general models , once one knows the appropriate density matrix , but in this paper we have applied it only to noninteracting models .",
    "since the many - particle density matrix eigenvalues are built , according to , from the single - particle pseudo - energies , the latter are the focus of our numerical investigations . now",
    "if our entire system consisted of the block in a pure state at @xmath61 , then every eigenvalue @xmath41 of the block green function matrix @xmath13 , being the average pseudo - occupation number @xmath34 of a pel , would either be one or zero . at @xmath62 , @xmath41 follow a fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "we will see later that cutting out a finite block from a @xmath61 system , by tracing over the environment of the block , has a similar effect on the eigenvalues of @xmath13 as would taking @xmath62 when the block is the whole system .    in a translationally invariant system with filling @xmath2 ( at @xmath61 ) , a fraction @xmath2 of the eigenvalues of @xmath13 are one , while the rest are zero . cutting out a block of length @xmath1 must smooth out this step ( much as having @xmath62 makes it into a fermi - dirac distribution ) , and we expect the transition from one to zero to occur over a fraction @xmath63 .",
    "this guess was inspired by the analogy of pseudo - energy @xmath8 in to the real energy , which near the fermi level scales linearly with wavevector @xmath63 .",
    "this @xmath64 scaling suggests the conjecture of a scaling form for the single - particle pseudo - energy like @xmath65 , and indeed we find below just such a scaling form .",
    "in this subsection we calculate numerically the eigenvalues @xmath41 of the block green function matrix @xmath13 , and use to compute the single - particle pseudo - energies @xmath8 . for a chain of free spinless fermions in its ground state ,",

    "[ fig : scalingplot ] , we see that @xmath75 is an odd function , i.e. @xmath77 which is what we would expect from particle - hole symmetry when the overall system is at half - filling , and @xmath75 has a finite positive slope at @xmath78 , i.e. @xmath79    $ ] as a function of the scaling variable @xmath73 - 1/2 $ ] for various block sizes at half - filling , showing a scaling collapse onto the scaling function @xmath75 . for @xmath80 , the largest and smallest pseudo - energies",

    "similar scaling behaviours of the form @xmath81 are found for all @xmath2 , with the generic scaling variable @xmath82 where @xmath83 plays the role of a fermi wavevector , and a filling fraction - dependent scaling function @xmath84 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : completescaling ] .",
    "the scaling functions continue to satisfy @xmath85 and @xmath86 but @xmath84 is no longer an odd function of @xmath74 for @xmath87 . instead",
    ", the particle - hole symmetry inherent in our model is manifested as @xmath88    , 0.3 , 0.7 and 0.9 , plotted against the scaling variable @xmath89 , for three different block sizes : @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) , @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) . ]    from and , we can write @xmath41 as @xmath96 which tells us that @xmath84 plays the role of a dispersion relation @xmath97 , while @xmath1 plays the role of the inverse temperature @xmath98 .",
    "this confirms our suspicion that the effect of cutting a block out of an overall system in its ground state at @xmath61 is to ascribe to the block an effective temperature . as expected , this effective temperature approaches zero as the block size is increased , since we are keeping more and more information about the overall system , which we know to be at @xmath61 .",
    "having understood that @xmath41 is related to the scaling function @xmath84 as in , we are now ready to investigate the scaling behaviour of the normalization constant @xmath99 , which is related to @xmath41 by .",
    "we do this first at half - filling . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdadiff ] , at half - filling roughly half of the @xmath41 are approximately one , whereas the other half are approximately zero .",

    "with our understanding of the structure of the many - particle density matrix eigenvalues and eigenstates developed in section  [ sect : dmstructure ] , and on the scaling behaviour of the single - particle found in section  [ sect : scaling ] , we want to now address the question of how much of the hilbert space we can truncate .",
    "clearly , the answer to this question depends on what measure of error we intend to use as our criteria for judging how well the truncated hilbert space describes the physics associated with the parent model . in this section",

    "a linear subspace of the hilbert space is chosen , and the hamiltonian projected onto this subspace . if @xmath353 is an eigenstate of the full hamiltonian , and if @xmath353 is retained in the truncated hilbert space , then it will continue to be an eigenstate of the truncated hamiltonian , with the same eigenvalue .",

    "the many - particle eigenstates of @xmath0 can then be interpreted simply as the many - body energy eigenstates of the system of noninteracting spinless fermions described by @xmath32 , and their associated density matrix weights are then their statistical weights in the grand canonical ensemble , _ as though _ the block is at a finite temperature . within this statistical - mechanical picture",
    ", we can apply intuitions learnt from the statistical mechanics of real fermionic systems , and talk about the filling of single - particle pseudo - energy levels ( pels ) as dictated by the fermi - dirac distribution , the pseudo - fermi sea with its pseudo - fermi level @xmath198 and particle - hole excitations of the pseudo - fermi sea .    using results obtained in ref .",
    ", we make this statistical - mechanical picture more precise , by identifying the single - particle eigenstates @xmath245 in of @xmath0 as those built up from the eigenvectors @xmath40 , @xmath248 , of the green function matrix @xmath13 restricted to the block .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath41 of @xmath13 , related to the single - particle pseudo - energies @xmath8 by and , are the average pseudo - occupation numbers of the @xmath218^th^ pel .",
    "the statistical mechanics of real fermionic systems tells us that , at finite temperature , the physically important many - body states are those low - energy particle - hole excitations involving single - particle energy levels within @xmath392 of the fermi level .",
    "single - particle energy levels far away from the fermi level contribute negligibly to the thermodynamic properties of the fermionic system , and are precisely the degrees of freedom to be truncated in a renormalization group analysis .",
    "we capitalize on this insight , and described a recipe for operator - based truncation of the density matrix eigenstates , where out of the @xmath1 pseudo - fermion operators @xmath391 , we truncate those @xmath53 s associated with single - particle pseudo - energies @xmath8 far away from @xmath198 and retain @xmath49 of them with @xmath393 . within this operator - based truncation scheme ,",
    "the effective pseudo - hamiltonian acting on the truncated hilbert space can be made to have the same form as the original pseudo - hamiltonian , in the same spirit of renormalization group transformations in statistical mechanics or quantum field theory .",
    "having laid out the basic principles behind our operator - based dm truncation scheme , we proceeded to look more closely into the distribution of single - particle pseudo - energies @xmath8 , and how these scale with the block size @xmath1 .",
    "there are two related questions that provide the motivation for doing this : ( 1 ) the statistical mechanics of real fermionic systems suggests that single - particle energy levels within @xmath394 of the fermi level are the physically relevant degrees of freedom  what then is the effective temperature @xmath395 that we should use as the natural cutoff when performing operator - based truncation on @xmath391 ?",
    "( 2 ) although we have associated the pseudo - dispersion relation @xmath8 with the dispersion relation @xmath97 of a real fermionic system of noninteracting spinless fermions , the wavevector @xmath251 enumerating @xmath97 is an _ intensive _ quantity whereas the ordinal number @xmath218 enumerating @xmath8 is an _ extensive _ quantity  what would the intensive analog of @xmath218 that more closely parallels the wavevector @xmath251 , and how would the pseudo - dispersion relation look like in terms of this intensive label ?",
    "the natural answer to the second question would be to write the pseudo - dispersion relation @xmath8 as a function of @xmath134 , totally analogous with how the wavevector @xmath251 is enumerated as @xmath396 for a chain of @xmath338 sites satisfying the born - von karman boundary condition .",
    "in fact , we find strong numerical evidence that suggests that the single - particle pseudo - energies , for various block sizes and fillings , satisfy a scaling relation of the form given in , where the scaling function @xmath84 is the proper analog of the dispersion relation @xmath97 , and the scaling variable @xmath74 given in is the proper analog of the wavevector @xmath251 . from",
    ", we see that the block size @xmath1 plays the role of inverse temperature .",
    "our scaling results in section  [ sect : scaling ] indicate that the density matrix eigenstates and eigenvalues behave , as block size @xmath1 is increased , very much as energy eigenstates and eigenvalues do when the system size is increased . in the latter case , we have a dispersion relation and are more or less sampling it at different wavevectors .",
    "it is not quite that simple in the density matrix case , since the scaling function  our analog of the energy dispersion relation  depends on the filling @xmath2 .",
    "we only note that this analogy still lacks an analytical foundation .",
    "a more penetrating analysis is called for of the relation of @xmath13 to @xmath0 ( or equivalently , the effect on its eigenvalues of restricting @xmath13 to sites on a block ) .",
    "incidentally , we noted that our equation relating @xmath13 to @xmath0 was valid at any temperature , but we assumed zero temperature throughout this paper .",
    "we expect nonzero temperature @xmath397 would become a second scaling variable . since @xmath62 has similar effects on the green function @xmath398 as does the gap introduced in , we expect the scaling also behaves similarly and we did not investigate it .      in a real application",
    ", it appears quite unlikely that hamiltonians will be projected directly onto large blocks ( meaning blocks of more than 16 sites ) .",
    "what then is the practical value of extracting scaling forms , if they are unambiguously seen only in blocks of 100 or more sites ?",
    "one answer is that , even though it is an oversimplified cartoon for the non - asymptotic situations in which it usually gets applied , a scaling law is easier to grasp than brute numerical or graphical facts .",
    "the scaling relation is a powerful tool that we can use to derive deeper understanding concerning the structure of the block density matrix , as well as various aspects of truncation .",
    "but in itself , the scaling relation provides only a partial answer to our first question , which is about how much of the hilbert space of many - body states on the block of @xmath1 sites we can truncate . to answer this question more completely , we looked at the three density matrix eigenstates @xmath121 , @xmath125 and @xmath124 with the largest weights . using the scaling relation , we find that the ratios @xmath399 of their weights ( @xmath179 being the largest density matrix weight ) approach a constant , in for a gapless system of noninteracting spinless fermions , as @xmath185 .",
    "the same result was also found for a gapped system of noninteracting spinless fermions , for which we find scaling relations governed by gap - dependent scaling functions .",
    "furthermore , the scaling relation allowed us to conclude that as @xmath185 , the largest density matrix weight @xmath179 approaches a constant given in , and derive approximately the dependence on the number @xmath49 of pels retained and the truncated weight @xmath14 in the operator - based dm truncation scheme .",
    "it is difficult to compare our results with those obtained in the context of the dmrg , because that is an incremental method . rather than obtain the density matrix of a large block all at once",
    ", each iteration of the dmrg takes an approximate density matrix for a block of @xmath1 sites and produces an approximate density matrix for a block of @xmath400 sites .",
    "the fraction of weight kept , which is taken as the figure of merit , refers to the small truncation in each iteration .",
    "the cumulative dmrg truncation might be more appropriate to compare with our results for rather large blocks .    nevertheless , let us note that operator - based truncation can be applied independent of whether we use an incremental or one - shot method .",
    "in particular , operator - based truncation could be used in a test run to apply dmrg to a noninteracting fermi chain .",
    "one is given a truncated list of @xmath148 operators @xmath401 where @xmath402 for the original block , and a hamiltonian projected onto it .",
    "one augments this list with the bare creation operators @xmath403 on a new site that will be added , and defines the new hamiltonian by adding the hopping to the new site .    in light of the derivation of ref .  , we anticipate that the density matrix of the augmented system s ground state must have the same quadratic form , with new operators @xmath404 , which could presumably be obtained merely by diagonalizing the single - particle sector .",
    "one simply deletes the least important member of this list to obtain a new truncated list , no longer than the original one .",
    "this difficulty notwithstanding , we still carried out a naive comparison of the performance of the operator - based dm truncation scheme against the traditional weight - ranked dm truncation scheme used in the dmrg , using the ability to exhaust the sum rule for a given total numer @xmath115 of density matrix eigenstates retained as a criterion .",
    "the conclusion : while the operator - based dm truncation scheme do not exhaust the sum rule as rapidly as the weight - ranked dm truncation scheme , @xmath14 is still of @xmath106 , i.e.  the significant parts of the total density matrix weight are ` captured ' by the operator - base dm truncation scheme .      however , we believe it is more important to check how well a truncation scheme do by calculating physical quantities , rather than rely solely on the truncated weight @xmath14 as a performance indicator . to this end , we calculated the dispersion relation of elementary excitations within the operator - based dm truncation scheme ( an easy thing to do ) , and found that the error incurred decays exponentially as @xmath49 , the number of pels retained when @xmath405 .",
    "this error is much smaller than @xmath16 , which is expected from a naive analysis based on the discarded weight @xmath15 . here",
    ", there is subtle worry that it may be that truncation works especially well for our chosen hopping hamiltonian is so local .",
    "a hamiltonian with longer range hopping would have the same fermi sea and hence the same density matrix , but the truncation errors might be worse .",
    "it would be desirable to also calculate the dispersion relation within the weight - ranked dm truncation scheme , and compare the results to those obtained within the operator - based dm truncation scheme .",
    "however , in the latter case it is problematic even to define the question , since each retained density matrix eigenstate would be a many - particle state .",
    "the new truncated hamiltonian might be conveniently expressed in terms of the pseudo - creation operators @xmath401 , but many combinations of occupations would not exist",
    ".    the situation would be somewhat analogous to taking a simple , noninteracting hopping hamiltonian for spinfull fermions , and imposing a gutzwiller projection ( no doubly occupied sites ) . in effect , the projection made a noninteracting model into an interacting one . similarly a weight - ranked truncation must introduce spurious interactions .",
    "hence , even if a system containing several blocks were to be exactly diagonalized ( using the truncated basis ) we could not immediately identify the elementary excitations .",
    "one would need , for example , to numerically compute a spectral function @xmath406 , where @xmath407 are momentum and energy , and then locate peaks as a function of @xmath408 . on the other hand , a system which is truncated using the operator - based truncation scheme can still be represented by a set of creation and annihilation operators .      following this ,",
    "we argued , based on the real - space structure of the one - particle density matrix eigenfunctions shown in section  [ sect : wavefunctionscaling ] , that an operator - based truncation scheme can also be defined naturally using the basis formed by single - particle plane wave ( pw ) states on the block of @xmath1 sites .",
    "the dispersion relation was calculated within this operator - based pw truncation scheme , and compared to that calculated within the operator - based dm truncation scheme .",
    "we find that , other than getting the dispersion exactly right at the zone center of the reduced brillouin zone , the operator - based pw truncation scheme is generally inferior to the operator - based dm truncation . instead of decaying exponentially as @xmath49 , the error in the dispersion relation calculated within the operator - based pw truncation scheme decays as a power law @xmath409 , which means that more single - particle basis states need to be retained in the operator - based pw truncation scheme as compared to the operator - based dm truncation scheme .",
    "it is not much harder in principle to analyze the proposed operator - based density matrix truncation scheme for _ noninteracting _ fermions in two dimensions .",
    "however , it will be harder to understand the scaling since we can not simply rank the eigenvalues .",
    "one dimension was special because we know that each successive state has one more node than the previous one .",
    "a further very important difference is that in @xmath411 there are just two fermi points , whereas in @xmath410 there is a fermi surface .",
    "thus , whereas in @xmath411 the density matrix eigenstates near the pseudo - fermi level are related to the energy eigenstates at @xmath330 , in @xmath410 these eigenstates will correspond to mixtures of wavevectors from every piece of the fermi surface .",
    "obviously , noninteracting systems do not require numerical studes , so we must clarify how our results are relevant to the problem of interacting systems .",
    "firstly , many ( gapless ) systems of interest are in a phase  fermi liquid , @xmath9-wave superconductor  which are noninteracting in the low - energy , long - wavelength limit .",
    "when applied to a fermi liquid system , we expect ( to the extent that the truncation has separated out the low energy modes ) that any iterative renormalization scheme will converge on the noninteracting limit , and it must behave properly in that limit to have even the hope of success .",
    "hence , for a density matrix - based scheme , the first order of business is to study the density matrix for a free fermion ground state ( as in this paper ) or for a bcs state,@xcite i.e.  that the density matrix will actually have the simple operator - based form , and hence its many - particle eigenstates of the density matrix really are built from the single - particle eigenstates .    for an interacting system",
    ", the truncated basis should of course be constructed using the many - body density matrix for that system ( not the noninteracting system ) .",
    "we expect that the operators generating this many - particle truncated basis will _ not _ just be those that create the 1-particle density matrix eigenstates ( they were in the noninteracting case studied in this paper ) .",
    "more thought will be needed as to discover the best recipe to optimize the truncation rule so as to balance the needs of sectors with different particle numbers in a strongly interacting system .",
    "the simple algebraic structure of the noninteracting density matrix eigenstates , considered in this paper , has motivated investigations ( in progress ) of the relationships among the many - particle density matrix eigenstates for an interacting system .",
    "a separate reason why our results for the noninteracting fermions are relevant to the study of interacting systems is that the scaling behaviour of the noninteracting density matrix should be a good guide to that of interacting systems , although details may differ .",
    "this is in the same sense that mean - field theory is a good guide to the overall pattern of critical phenomena .",
    "however , other interacting models of interest sit at quantum critical points that are not described by quasiparticle interactions , or possess fractionalized excitations . since we do not presently understand the proper way to write their wavefunctions in terms of a spatially blocked basis , nor the proper renormalization step to capture the interblock correlations in the fractionalized systems , we do not know if a plain block density matrix gives the proper basis for truncation of the states . furthermore , in the absence of an analytic construction of the block density matrix , for example , for laughlin s quantum hall wavefunction or the one - dimensional su - schrieffer state , we can not proceed to scaling studies of large blocks like those found in the present paper , but numerical studies of such density matrices might be an illuminating subject for future research .    this research is supported by nsf grant dmr-9981744 , and made use of the computing facility of the cornell center for materials research ( ccmr ) with support from the national science foundation materials research science and engineering centers ( mrsec ) program ( dmr-0079992 ) .",
