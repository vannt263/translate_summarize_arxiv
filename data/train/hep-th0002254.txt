    "the object of this paper is to carry on studying the local potential approximation of the exact renormalization group ( rg ) equation for the scalar theory @xcite . in a previous publication @xcite ( to be considered as the part i of the present work )",
    ", we had already considered this approximation with a view to qualitatively discuss the connection between the standard perturbative renormalization of field theory ( as it can be found in most textbooks on field theory , see for example @xcite ) and the modern view @xcite in which the renormalized parameters of a field theory are introduced as the `` relevant '' directions of a fixed point ( fp ) of a rg transform .",
    "actually the local potential approximation , which allows us to consider all the powers of the field @xmath7 on the same footing , is an excellent textbook example of the way infinitely many degrees of freedom are accounted for in ( nonperturbative ) rg theory .",
    "almost all the characteristics of the rg theory are involved in this approximation .",
    "the only lacking features are related to phenomena highly correlated to the non local parts neglected in the approximation and when the critical exponent @xmath8 is small ( especially for @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , one expects the approximation to be qualitatively correct on all aspects of the rg theory @xcite .    in the following we look at the domains of attraction or of repulsion of fixed points in the @xmath0 scalar theory in three and four dimensions ( @xmath10 and @xmath9 ) .    at first sight",
    ", one could think that the issue considered is very simple since , with regard to criticality , the @xmath0-symmetric systems in three dimensions are known to belong to the same class of universality ( the ising class ) .",
    "now , because the ising class is associated to the domain of attraction of the unique ( non - trivial ) wilson - fisher fixed point @xcite , then by adjusting one parameter ( in order to reach the critical temperature ) any @xmath0 scalar hamiltonian should be driven to the wilson - fisher fixed point under the action of renormalization .",
    "consequently there would have only two domains for the @xmath0 scalar theory : the critical subspace @xmath1 ( of codimension 1 ) in the wilson space ( @xmath11 ) of infinite dimensions of the hamiltonian parameters ( in which the rg transforms generate flows ) and the complement to @xmath11 of @xmath1 ( corresponding to noncritical hamiltonians ) .",
    "in fact , that is not correct because there is another fixed point in @xmath11 : the gaussian fixed point which , although trivial , controls tricritical behaviors in three dimensions .",
    "now each fp has its own basin of attraction in @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the attraction domain of the gaussian fp is the tricritical subspace @xmath4 of codimension 2 ( with no intersection with @xmath1 ) .",
    "in addition , we show that there is a second subspace of codimension 1 in @xmath11 , called @xmath2 , which is different from @xmath1 , and thus which is not a domain of attraction to the wilson - fisher fixed point .",
    "there is no fp to which a point of @xmath2 is attracted to .",
    "@xmath2 is characterized by a negative sign of the @xmath12-hamiltonian parameter @xmath13 and is associated with systems undergoing a first - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "we show that an endless attractive rg trajectory is associated to this domain of first - order transitions .",
    "it is a renormalized trajectory ( denoted below by t@xmath14 ) that emanates from the gaussian fixed point .",
    "the frontier between @xmath15 and @xmath1 corresponds to the tricritical subspace @xmath4 which is the domain of attraction of the gaussian fixed point while @xmath16 and @xmath1 are two distinct domains of repulsion for the gaussian fixed point .",
    "actually , the situation is conform to the usual view .",
    "considering the famous @xmath5-model [ landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) hamiltonian ] in which the associated coupling @xmath13 is positive , then the hamiltonian at criticality is attracted exclusively to the wilson - fisher fixed point , but if @xmath13 is negative , a @xmath17-term is required for stability , but then one may get either a tricritical phase transition or a second- or a first - order transition @xcite . in the present study we do not truncate the hamiltonian which involves all the powers of the field @xmath7 .",
    "we explicitly show that a system which would correspond to an initial point lying very close to the frontier @xmath4 in the critical side ( in @xmath18 ) would display a retarded classical - to - ising crossover @xcite .",
    "this result is interesting with regard to ionic systems ( for example ) in which a classical behavior has been observed while an ising like critical behavior was expected .",
    "the eventuality of a retarded crossover from the classical to the ising behavior has previously been mentioned but without theoretical explanation on how this kind of crossover could develop @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a calculation suggests that the rpm model for ionic systems would specifically correspond to a scalar hamiltonian with a negative sign for the @xmath5-hamiltonian parameter ( but the order parameter chosen is not the bulk density @xcite ) .",
    "that calculation has motivated the present study .",
    "we also indicate that the renormalized trajectory t@xmath19 still exists in four dimensions .",
    "this makes the gaussian fixed point ultraviolet stable and the scalar field theory _ formally _ asymptotically free .",
    "however the associated `` perfect '' action @xcite would have the wrong sign to provide us with an acceptable ( well defined ) field theory .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows . in section [ lpa - erge ]",
    "we briefly present the local potential approximation of the exact rg equation to be studied .",
    "we introduce the strategy we have chosen to solve the resulting nonlinear differential equation with a view to show the trajectories of interest in the space @xmath11 of infinite dimension .",
    "because the practical approach to the gaussian fixed point is made difficult due to the logarithmic slowness characteristic of a marginally irrelevant direction ( for @xmath10 ) , we found it useful to first test our numerical method with a close approach to the wilson - fisher fixed point .",
    "we present the characteristic results of this approach and the various kinds of domains corresponding to @xmath20 ( somewhat a summary of @xcite )    in section [ uneg ] we describe the various kinds of attraction or repulsion domains of the gaussian fixed point ( for a negative value of the @xmath12-hamiltonian parameter ) corresponding to tricritical , critical and first - order subspaces .",
    "then we discuss the consequences and especially explicitly show how a retarded crossover from the classical to the ising behavior can be obtained .",
    "we then shortly discuss the case @xmath9 when @xmath21 .    in two appendices we report on some technical aspects of the numerical treatment of the rg equation",
    "studied , in particular on the appearance of spurious nontrivial tricritical fixed points ( appendix [ spurious ] ) .",
    "the local potential approximation has been first considered by nicoll et al @xcite from the sharp cutoff version of the exact rg equation of wegner and houghton @xcite , it has been rederived by tokar @xcite by using approximate functional integrations and rediscovered by hasenfratz and hasenfratz @xcite . as in @xcite",
    "we adopt the notation of the latter authors and consider the following nonlinear differential equation for the simple function @xmath22 : @xmath23 in which a prime refers to a derivative with respect to the constant dimensionless field @xmath7 ( at constant @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 is the derivative of the dimensionless potential @xmath26 ; @xmath27 stands for @xmath28 in which @xmath24 is the scale parameter defined by @xmath29e@xmath30 and corresponding to the reduction to @xmath31 of an arbitrary initial momentum scale of reference @xmath32 ( the initial sharp momentum cutoff ) . finally , @xmath33 is the surface of the @xmath34-dimensional unit sphere divided by @xmath35 .",
    "a fixed point is solution of the equation @xmath36 .",
    "the study of the resulting second order differential equation provides the following results :    * @xmath37 , no fp is found except the gaussian fixed point . *",
    "@xmath38 , one nontrivial fp ( the wilson - fisher fixed point @xcite ) is found @xcite * a new nontrivial fp emanates from the origin ( the gaussian fixed point ) below each dimensional threshold @xmath39 , @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "if one represents the function @xmath22 as a sum of monomials of the form :    @xmath41 then , for @xmath10 , the wilson - fisher fixed point @xmath42 is located in @xmath11 at @xcite : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , etc .",
    "once the fp is known , one may study its vicinity which is characterized by orthogonal directions corresponding to the infinite set of eigenvectors , solutions of the differential equation ( [ eq4 ] ) linearized at @xmath42 .",
    "the eigenvectors associated to positive eigenvalues are said relevant ; when the eigenvalues are negative they are said irrelevant and marginal otherwise @xcite .",
    "the relevant eigenvectors correspond to directions along which the rg trajectories go away from the fp and the irrelevant eigenvectors correspond to directions along which the trajectories go into the fp .",
    "a marginal eigenvector may be relevant or irrelevant .",
    "our present fp @xmath42 has only one relevant direction and infinitely many irrelevant directions ( no marginal direction , however see @xcite ) . as already explained and shown in @xcite , in order to approach @xmath42 starting from an initial point in @xmath11",
    ", one must adjust one parameter of the initial function @xmath47 .",
    "this amounts to fixing the temperature of a system to its critical temperature .    starting with a known initial function ( at `` time '' @xmath48 )",
    "say :    @xmath49 we adjust @xmath50 to the critical value @xmath51 corresponding to @xmath52 so that @xmath22 [ solution at time @xmath24 of the differential equation ( [ eq4 ] ) ] approaches @xmath42 when @xmath53 . the approach to @xmath54",
    "is characterized by the least negative eigenvalue @xmath55 ( @xmath56 was noted @xmath57 in @xcite ) .",
    "this means that , in the vicinity of @xmath42 any parameter @xmath58 evolves as follows ( @xmath53 ) : @xmath59    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates this feature for the first four @xmath58 s in the approach to @xmath42 . in @xcite the two associated attractive trajectories ( locally tangent to the least irrelevant eigenvector in the vicinity of @xmath42 )",
    "was noted t@xmath60 and t@xmath61 .",
    "one may also constrain the trajectory to approach @xmath42 along the second irrelevant direction ( with the associated attractive trajectories noted t@xmath62 or t@xmath63 in @xcite and associated with the second least negative eigenvalue @xmath64 ) . in this case a second parameter of the initial @xmath65 must be adjusted , e.g. , @xmath66 must be adjusted to @xmath67 _ and _ _ simultaneously _ @xmath68 to the corresponding @xmath69 , see @xcite .",
    "then , in the vicinity of @xmath42 , any parameter @xmath70 will evolve as follows : @xmath71    looking for this kind of approach to @xmath42 , we have found that @xmath72 and @xmath73 this has allowed us to estimate @xmath74 .",
    "although the shooting method is certainly not well adapted to the determination of the eigenvalues ( see the huge number of digits required in the determination of @xmath75 and @xmath67 ) , our estimate is close to @xmath76 found by comellas and travesset @xcite .",
    "because @xmath67 can not be perfectly determined , the trajectory leaves the trajectory t@xmath77 before reaching @xmath42 to take one of the two directions t@xmath60 or t@xmath78 ( corresponding to @xmath56 ) .",
    "fig [ fig2 ] illustrates this effect with the evolution , for @xmath79 , of the following effective eigenvalue :    @xmath80    the definition of which does not refer explicitly to @xmath42 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath81 shows a flat extremum ( or a flat inflexion point ) at an rg eigenvalue of @xmath42 each time the rg flow runs along an eigendirection in the vicinity of @xmath42 .",
    "similarly to @xmath67 , the value @xmath69 can not be perfectly determined , consequently the trajectory ends up going away from the fixed point .",
    "this provides us with the opportunity of determining the only positive ( the relevant ) eigenvalue corresponding to the critical exponent @xmath82 [ @xmath81 shows then a flat extremum at @xmath83 when the flow still runs in the close vicinity of @xmath42 ] .",
    "finally , far away from the fixed point , the rg trajectory approaches the trivial high temperature fixed point characterized by a classical eigenvalue ( equal to @xmath85 ) .",
    "the global picture summarizing the evolution of @xmath81 along a rg trajectory initialized in such a way as to approach @xmath42 first along t@xmath62 , is drawn on fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "the values we have determined by this shooting method are ( for eigenvalues other than @xmath86 already mentioned ) :    @xmath87    which are close to the values found , for example , in @xcite : @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "in the preceding section , we have obtained a rg trajectory approaching the wilson - fisher fixed point @xmath42 along t@xmath77 by adjusting two parameters of the initial hamiltonian ( @xmath67 and @xmath69 ) .",
    "this is exactly the procedure one must follow to determine a tricritical rg trajectory approaching the gaussian fixed point in three dimensions ( because of its two relevant directions ) .",
    "the only difficulty is to discover initial points in @xmath90 which are attracted to the gaussian fixed point . to this end",
    ", we again use the shooting method .    from usual arguments on the lgw hamiltonian and from the work done by aharony on compressible ferromagnets @xcite ,",
    "one expects to find the tricritical surface in the sector @xmath21 ( and with @xmath91 ) .",
    "thus we have tried to approach the gaussian fixed point starting with initial function @xmath92 of the form : @xmath93 with ( not large ) negative values of @xmath94 , for example @xmath95 .    because the gaussian fixed point is twice unstable , we must adjust two parameters to approach it starting with ( [ eq - init - tri1 ] ) .",
    "we do that by successive tries ( shooting method ) . for example , if we choose @xmath96 and @xmath97 and determine a value of @xmath98 such as to get a trajectory which does not go immediately towards the trivial high temperature fixed point , the best we obtain is a trajectory which approaches the wilson - fisher fixed point ( thus the corresponding initial point belongs to the attraction domain of @xmath42 although @xmath99 @xcite ) .",
    "but if @xmath100 , the adjustment of @xmath50 with a view to counterbalance the effect of the most relevant direction of the gaussian fixed point ( which would drive the trajectory toward the high temperature fp ) yields a runaway rg flow towards larger and larger negative values of @xmath101 .",
    "from now on , the target is bracketted : the tricritical trajectory corresponding to @xmath102 can be obtained with a value of @xmath103 in the range @xmath104 2,3\\right [ $ ] ( we actually find a rather close approach to the gaussian fixed point for @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) .    in order to understand the origin of the direction of runaway in the sector of negative values of @xmath13 , it is worth to study the properties of the gaussian fixed point by linearization of the rg flow equation in the vicinity of the origin . if we request the effective potential to be bounded by polynomials then the linearization of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) identifies with the differential equation of hermite s polynomials of degree @xmath107 for the set of discrete values of @xmath108 satisfying @xcite :    @xmath109    from which it follows that    * for @xmath9 : @xmath110 @xmath111 , there are two non - negative eigenvalues : @xmath112 and @xmath113 * for @xmath10 : @xmath114 @xmath111 , there are three non - negative eigenvalues : @xmath112 , @xmath115 et @xmath116    if we denote by @xmath117 the eigenfunctions associated to the eigenvalue @xmath118 , it comes :    * @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , whatever the spatial dimensionality @xmath34 .",
    "the upperscript `` @xmath123 '' is just a reminder of the fact that the eigenfunctions are defined up to a global factor and thus the functions @xmath124 are also eigenfunctions with the same eigenvalue @xmath118 .      similarly to @xmath125 ,",
    "the direction provided by @xmath126 in @xmath90 is a direction of instability of the gaussian fixed point .",
    "now @xmath127 is associated with the well known renormalized trajectory t@xmath60 on which is defined the usual ( massless ) @xmath128-field theory @xcite , for the same reasons a renormalized trajectory t@xmath129 locally tangent to @xmath126 in the vicinity of the origin of @xmath11 exists with the same properties as t@xmath60 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the difference is that t@xmath19 lies entirely in the sector @xmath21 and is endless ( not ended by a fixed point ) .",
    "this endless renormalized trajectory is associated with systems undergoing a first - order phase transition .",
    "this is due to the absence of fixed point @xcite , in which case the correlation length @xmath130 can not be made infinite although for some systems lying close to t@xmath19 and attracted to it ( i.e. at the transition temperature ) , @xmath130 may be very large ( because t@xmath19 is endless ) , in which cases one may say that the transition is almost of second order @xcite . of course , a domain of first - order phase transition in @xmath11 was expected from the usual arguments @xcite , we only specify better the conditions of realization , in @xmath11 , of the first - order transition .",

    "t@xmath19 together with the attractive tricritical line approaching the gaussian fixed point . the tricritical surface @xmath4 separates the first - order surface @xmath2 from the critical surface @xmath1 . fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows also that systems lying close to the tricritical surface may still be attracted to the wilson - fisher fixed point . in this case",
    "the effective exponents may undergo a very retarded crossover to the asymptotic ising values compared to usual systems corresponding to initial points chosen in the sector @xmath20 of @xmath11 .",
    "[ fig5 ] illustrates how minus the inverse of ( [ eq - omegaeff ] ) provides us with different evolutions [ calculated from ( [ eq4 ] ) ] of the effective exponent @xmath131 [ with @xmath132 $ ] according to the initial point chosen in @xmath11 .",
    "it is worth to explain how we have defined @xmath133 .",
    "we have seen at the end of section [ lpa - erge ] that the quantity ( [ eq - omegaeff ] ) undergoes a flat extremum ( or a flat inflexion point ) at an rg eigenvalue of @xmath42 each time the rg flow runs along an eigendirection in the vicinity of @xmath42 .",
    "now it happens that this extremum is less and less flat as one chooses larger and larger values of @xmath134 ( for the eigenvalue @xmath135 ) but still exists .",
    "this provides us with a way to express the evolution of an effective exponent @xmath136 when the rg - substitute to @xmath137 , namely @xmath138 , is varied .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows such an evolution for some initial hamiltonian ( with @xmath139 ) .",
    "notice that for such a hamiltonian , the extremum disappears before @xmath136 reaches the trivial value @xmath85 ( associated with the approach to the trivial high temperature fixed point and to a regular non critical behavior ) while in the case of a hamiltonian initialized close to the tricritical surface , the classical - to - ising crossover is complete ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this is because in the latter case the rg trajectory comes close to the gaussian fixed point ( and @xmath140 has an extremum at @xmath85 ) before approaching to @xmath42 .",
    "this reinforces the idea that the so - called classical - to - ising crossover actually exists only between the gaussian and wilson - fisher fixed points @xcite .    the same configuration displayed by fig .",

    "hence the marginal parameter decreases as @xmath24 grows .",
    "as it is well known , in four dimensions the marginal parameter is irrelevant .",
    "however , if one considers the direction opposite to @xmath125 ( i.e. @xmath126 ) then the evolution corresponds to changing @xmath149 .",
    "this gives , for small values of @xmath146 : @xmath150 $ ] and the parameter becomes relevant .",

    "we have verified that the trajectory t@xmath19 survives when @xmath9 ( contrary to t@xmath60 , see @xcite ) . that trajectory t@xmath129 is a renormalized trajectory on which we could define a continuum limit for the @xmath6-field theory and if the corresponding ( perfect ) action was positive for all @xmath7",
    ", one could say that the @xmath155-field theory with a negative coupling is asymptotically free . unfortunately , because the @xmath5-term is dominant for large @xmath7 in the vicinity of the origin of @xmath11 ( due to the relevant direction provided by @xmath126 ) , the negative sign of the renormalized coupling prevents the path integral to be well defined .",
    "however , because the action to which one refers in the continuum limit ( the perfect action ) is formal ( because it involves an infinite number of parameters and can not be written down , see @xcite ) we wonder whether the wrong sign of the action is actually a valid argument to reject the @xmath156-field theory with a negative renormalized coupling .",
