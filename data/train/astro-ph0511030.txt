    "galactic black hole binaries at high mass accretion rates show spectra which are often dominated by a soft , quasi - thermal component ( e.g. the review by tanaka & lewin 1995 ) .",
    "this shape matches very well with that expected from an optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disc , as described in the seminal paper by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) .",
    "this identification is strengthened by observations of variability in which the temperature , @xmath4 , and luminosity , @xmath5 , of this quasi - thermal component change together in such a way as to indicate that the size of the emitting structure remains approximately constant ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the last stable orbit is the only obvious candidate for such a radius , so this gives compelling evidence for a key prediction of general relativity , as well as providing an observable diagnostic of the mass and spin of the black hole ( ebisawa et al 1994 ; kubota et al 2001 ; gierliski & done 2004 ; kubota & done 2004 ; hereafter kd04 ) .",
    "the most recent models of accretion disc spectra are able to reproduce this behavior ( davis et al 2005 ; davis , done & blaes 2006 ) .",
    "these supersede earlier models which showed strong deviations from the @xmath7 relation , but which did not include metal opacity nor treat the difference in vertical structure between the radiation and gas pressure dominated regimes ( merloni , fabian & ross 2000 ) .",
    "the disc dominated spectra always contain some small fraction of emission in a tail extending to much higher energies .",
    "however , some high luminosity spectra have a rather different spectral shape , where the tail contains a much larger fraction of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the disc emission in these spectra ( variously termed very high or steep power law dominant state , hereafter vhs ; miyamoto et al .",
    "1991 ; mcclintock & remillard 2003 ) is less obvious due to the lower contrast against the strong continuum .",
    "nonetheless , it can be identified in spectral fitting , but its derived parameters ( temperature and luminosity ) are somewhat dependent on how the tail is modelled , which in turn depends on the radiation processes involved .",
    "a power law or broken power law description for the tail might be appropriate if the emission is from nonthermal electrons in the jet , but these models require fine tuning in order to match all the observational constraints .",
    "conversely , comptonisation models , where the disc is the source of seed photons , rather naturally reproduce both multiwavelength spectral constraints and x - ray variability patterns ( see  3 ) , so here we explore the consequences of such models .",
    "firstly , the disc temperature in gbh is close to ( or within ! ) the observed x - ray bandpass , so the low energy break in the comptonised component is predicted to be present , giving a rather different spectrum at low energies to that of a power law which extends unbroken through the disc emission .",
    "thus using proper comptonisation models can significantly change the parameters of the inferred disc component ( done , @xmath8ycki & smith 2002 ) and distort the measured luminosity - temperature relation ( kubota et al 2001 ; kubota & makishima 2004 ; kd04 ) .",
    "this helps considerably in interpreting data from the weak vhs , where the disc contributes more than half of the total bolometric luminosity .",
    "a power law model for the tail in these data gives derived disc temperatures which are significantly higher than those seen from the same source at the same disc luminosity in the high / soft state .",
    "using proper comptonisation models instead of the power law approximately recovers the @xmath7 behavior ( kubota et al 2001 ; kubota & makishima 2004 ; kd04 ) .",
    "the match to the high / soft state data is even better with an additional correction to the observed disc luminosity to account for the photons which are scattered into the comptonised spectrum ( kubota & makishima 2004 ; kd04 ) .",
    "however , the most strongly comptonised vhs ( where the disc is less than half of the bolometric luminosity ) have disk spectra which show significantly lower temperatures than those seen at the same disc luminosity in the high / soft state .",
    "these are inconsistent with a constant disc radius even with proper comptonisation models and correction for scattering ( kd04 ) .",
    "this could indicate that the disc is truncated above the last stable orbit ( kd04 ) , but here we explore whether this conclusion is required with a more sophisticated approach to comptonisation .",
    "the parameters derived for the hot electrons indicate that the compton cloud is marginally optically thick , with @xmath1  23 .",
    "this material plainly must intercept the disc photons in order to comptonise them , so will also distort our view of the disc ( kd04 ) .",
    "an optically thick corona over the inner disc could simply hide the hottest part of the disc from view .",
    "more likely , the power dissipated in the corona can _ reduce _ the disc emissivity ( e.g. svensson & zdziarski 1994 ) since the energy in the corona must derive ultimately from the accretion flow .",
    "we build explicit models of an inner disc- corona to explore these ideas , and fit them to two strong vhs spectra ( simultaneous 0.7 200  kev asca and rxte data ) of the galactic black hole binary xte  j@xmath0 to constrain the possible geometries of the disk - corona in this state .    in  2",
    ", we review the spectral parameters ( luminosity and temperature ) of the geometrically thin disk in the disk dominated high / soft state . in ",
    "3 we describe the simultaneous asca - rxte observations of the broadband spectra .",
    "we compare the derived disc emission in the vhs to that seen in the high / soft state , showing that it implies a very different disc area and/or emissivity (  4 ) . in  5 we describe our model of an inner disc corona above a standard emissivity disc .",
    "fitting this to the data shows explicitly that optical depth effects alone can not hide the inner disc , and that this model requires a large change in disc area compared to the high / soft state .",
    "we modify this in  6 to incorporate energetic coupling of the inner disc and corona as in svensson & zdziarski ( 1994 ) .",
    "the reduction in disc emissivity and temperature under the corona means this model can fit the observed spectra with only a small - or possibly no - increase in disc area .",
    "we review all the results of the models in  7 , and then incorporate additional constraints from other spectral and timing characteristics of this state in  8 .",
    "we show that an optically thick comptonisation in an inner disc corona is not inconsistent with the presence of high frequency qpo s .",
    "however , it does conflict with claims of a strong , extremely broad iron line in these spectra ( miller et al 2004 ) .",
    "we show that there is strong evidence supporting comptonisation as the emission mechanism for the tail (  9 ) , whereas there is an alternative explanation for the iron line , in which its width is overestimated due to the unrecognized presence of absorption lines ( done & gierlinki 2006 ) .",
    "all the comptonisation models considered here _ require _ that the inner disc changes in extent and/or emissivity in response to the presence of the corona .",
    "there are no solutions in which the inner disc has the same radial structure as that seen in the high / soft state .",
    "in all the following we use the binary system parameters determined by the optical studies of orosz et al . ( 2002 ) i.e. mass of 8.411.2 @xmath9 , distance , @xmath10 , of @xmath11  5  kpc and binary inclination angle , @xmath12 , of @xmath13 ( orosz et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , we are primarily interested in _ changes _ in the disc emitting area rather than absolute values i.e. in comparing the disc structure in the vhs with that seen in the disc dominated high / soft states .",
    "the high / soft states in xte  j@xmath14 have been well fit using the diskbb model ( mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) in xspec ( kubota & makishima  2004 ; gierliksi & done 2004 ; kd04 ) , giving a clear @xmath7 relationship , implying constant area , over a factor 100 change in disc luminosity .",
    "such an obviously thermal relationship between luminosity and temperature from diskbb fits is now predicted by the best current models of the disc spectra which include radiative transfer with full metal opacities and self consistent vertical structure as well as relativistic effects ( davies et al 2005 ) .",
    "the apparent inner disc radius of this source , @xmath15 , is obtained from the normalization of diskbb model , defined as @xmath16 .",
    "the average value inferred from all the high / soft state constant area diskbb results is @xmath17 km .",
    "however , the true inner disc radius is related to this apparent radius via a series of correction factors ( for the stress free inner boundary condition , effective temperature not equal to colour temperature and relativistic effects ; e.g. kubota et al 1998 ; 2001 ) . however , the fractional _ change _ in inferred disc radius is unaffected by uncertainties in distance , inclination and correction factors , so we give the apparent inner radius , @xmath15 as a _ ratio _ of diskbb normalisation seen in these fits to that derived from all the high / soft state data in kubota & makishima ( 2004 ) .",
    "these ratios are not sensitive to any of the binary system uncertainties , so can sensitively show the _ change _ in the disc properties between the high / soft and vhs .",
    "asca observations of this source were performed three times , on 1998 september 12 , 23 , and 1999 march 17 .",
    "there are simultaneous _ rxte",
    "_ observations corresponding to each asca observation .",
    "the second data set shows a strongly comptonised vhs spectrum , and was included in the analysis of kd04 .",
    "here we also study the first simultaneous data set , which is at the boundary between the low / hard state and the strongly comptonised vhs .",
    "we do not use the third asca dataset as the gain was changed on the corresponding _ rxte _ data dataset midway through the observation , and the spectrum is only a weakly comptonised vhs .",
    "the observational i d s of the corresponding rxte data are 30188 - 06 - 05 - 00 and 30191 - 01 - 10 - 00 , for the first and second asca observations , respectively .",
    "we use the data as extracted by kd04 ( standard procedures for selecting good pca and hexte data , with pca responses derived for each observation using _ pcarsp _ v8.0 : see appendix for a comparison with _ pcarsp _",
    "we use the pca data from 320  kev , and hexte from 20 - 200  kev .",
    "the asca gis events were extracted from circular regions of @xmath18 radius centered on the image peak , after selecting good time intervals in a standard procedure .",
    "net exposures of 1.4  ks and 2.4  ks were obtained for the simultaneous pointing on the first and second observations , respectively .",
    "the dead time correction fractions for the first asca data set are 76.1% for gis2 and 77.9% for gis3 , determined by reference to the count - rate monitor data with little dead time , using the method described in makishima et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "similarly , for the second observation , these are calculated as 85.6% and 87.3% for gis2 and gis3 , respectively .",
    "we only use the gis data ( 0.710  kev ) since the sis is strongly affected by pileup .    in order to take into account the calibration uncertainties , we add 1% systematic errors to the gis spectra ( makishima et al 1996 ) and 0.5% systematic errors to the pca .",
    "we also include 0.5% systematic uncertainty on the hexte data to be conservative , though this does not significantly change the fit ( see appendix ) .",
    "we allow @xmath19 to be free ( described using wabs ) as the low energy bandpass of the asca gis constrains this parameter .",
    "the data from different instruments are fitted with same model parameters except that relative normalization factors are free .",
    "hereafter , we use the normalization of the pca in the fitting results so as to be able to directly compare with the pca analysis of kubota & makishima ( 2004 ) for the disc spectra . using this",
    "we find the observed ( i.e. absorbed ) 0.7 200  kev fluxes of @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the first and second observations , respectively , corresponding to observed luminosities of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for isotropic emission .",
    "correcting for absorption and the energy band gives a bolometric luminosity of @xmath24 and @xmath25 i.e. about 35 per cent of the eddington limit .",
    "= 0.65    these vhs spectra are dominated by a strong , steep continuum rather than the disc , though the disc can still be seen .",
    "the continuum shape is complex : fits using a single power law ( together with the disc , and including a smeared edge and gaussian to phenomenologically model the reflection components ) are completely statistically unacceptable , with @xmath26 of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , for the first and second datasets , respectively .",
    "this was also shown by sobczak et al ( 1999 ) , who had to fit the pca and hexte data separately in order to get acceptable fits with a power law continuum .",
    "however , the continuum curvature is complex : a single thermal comptonisation model for the tail ( with disc , smeared edge and gaussian line ) gives a much improved fit over a power law , but the fits are not formally acceptable at @xmath26 of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the complex form of the tail is shown in more detail by gierliski & done ( 2003 ) , who used osse data together with the pca and hexte to extend the bandpass beyond 500  kev for times around that of the second dataset used here .",
    "these clearly showed that the curvature seen in the tail can not be matched by comptonisation from thermal or non - thermal electrons ( see fig .",
    "5 of gierliski & done 2003 ) .",
    "instead the continuum shows features of _ both _ thermal _ and _ non - thermal electrons ( see also zdziarski et al 2001 for similar spectra from grs  1915 + 105 ) . here",
    "we follow kd04 and approximate this by using the thcomp model ( zdziarski , johnson & magdziarz 1996 ; now publically available as a local model in xspec ) to describe the thermal compton scattering , together with a weak power law of @xmath31 fixed at 2 to approximate the higher energy ( non- thermal ) emission .",
    "we have checked that our results on the disc temperature and luminosity are not dependent on this approximation for the shape of the high energy spectrum by using the full hybrid thermal - nonthermal comptonisation code eqpair ( coppi 1999 ) on our final model of the comptonised disc - corona described in  6 .",
    "the seed photons in thcomp are set to be from the disc ( giving a slightly different low energy rollover to that produced by the comptt model in the xspec general release which assumes a wien distribution ) .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the comptonising corona covers the whole disc , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch1]a .    following kd04 we use several different descriptions of the reflected emission , to try to assess the effect on the derived disc parameters of systematic uncertainties in current reflection models .",
    "firstly we use the gaussian line and smeared edge to give a phenomenological description of reflection ( seg ) .",
    "then we replace these components with the physical reflection model incorporated in thcomp ( ref ) which includes both full reflected continuum and self  consistent iron line emission for arbitrary ionization state of the reflected material ( @xmath8ycki , done & smith 1999 ) .",
    "ionization is important as the lack of photoelectric opacity in ionized material means reflection contributes to the low energy spectrum so can affect the derived disc temperature and luminosity .",
    "however , the ionised reflection in thcomp does not include compton up and downscattering of the reflected emission in the disc itself .",
    "this is important for highly ionized and/or hot discs , and leads to strong distortions on the predicted line and edge shape in the reflected emission which can affect the spectral fitting , either by distorting the inferred solid angle of reflecting material , or its ionization or amount of relativistic smearing ( ross , fabian & young 1999 ; ballantyne , ross & fabian 2001 ; done & gierliksi 2006 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the conflict with the broad iron line motivates us to review the evidence for comptonisation as the emission mechanism for the tail seen in these data .",
    "the only feasible alternative appears to be the jet .",
    "x - ray emission from the jet in the low / hard state has been proposed by e.g. markoff et al ( 2001 ) , so here we use this as a guide to what might be expected from these models in the vhs .",
    "direct synchrotron emission might give rise to a power law , or broken power law , or cutoff power law tail ( markoff et al 2001 ; wilms et al 2005 ; markoff , nowak & wilms 2005 ) . in ",
    "3 we showed that a power law gave a completely unacceptable fit to these data , but a broken power law is as good a description of the continuum as our thermal+nonthermal comptonisation model ( see appendix ) .",
    "however , such models run into difficulties when extrapolated to lower energies as the steep spectrum dominates the bolometric luminosity .",
    "[ fig : opt_x]a shows this for the best fit broken power law and disc continuum model for the second dataset .",
    "the extrapolated x - ray continuum overpredicts the simultaneously observed optical v and b points ( dereddedned using @xmath32 ) of jain et al ( 1999 ) by a factor of over 1000 .",
    "clearly the data strongly require that there is a low energy break in the continuum between the soft x - ray and optical wavebands .",
    "such a break can be produced from jet models at the point where the jet synchrotron emission becomes optically thick to self - absorption ( e.g. markoff , nowak & wilms 2005 ; giannios 2005 ) . however , there are some constrains on the energy of this break from variability arguments . the short timescale r.m.s .",
    "variability spectra of these vhs pca data show a monotonic increase in fractional variability amplitude with energy form 350  kev , consistent with pivoting about a fixed point at @xmath33  kev ( gierliski & zdziarski 2005 ) .",
    "there is no obvious reason for jet models to pick out such an energy .",
    "this contrasts with models in which the x - ray continuum is produced by compton scattering of disc photons .",
    "this naturally produces a break in the comptonised continuum at energies below the seed photon energy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : opt_x]b ) , and since this is at @xmath34  kev there is no fine tuning required to explain this energy being picked out as the spectral pivot .",
    "gierliski & zdziarski ( 2005 ) show that for the second dataset used here , the r.m.s .",
    "variability spectrum from the pca is well matched by thermal compton scattering of the disc photons ( see also rodrigues et al 2004 ; zdziarski et al 2005 ; sobolewska & @xmath8ycki 2006 for the same results for other vhs spectra ) .",
    "the comptonisation models actually underpredict the optical flux , but this is expected as the disc model here only includes direct emission , while reprocessing is likely to be an important contributor to the optical emission ( e.g. esin et al 2000 ; hynes 2005 ) , and optical synchrotron emission from the jet may also be present ( see turler et al 2004 for a model of the plateau / state c / class @xmath35 state of grs 1915 + 105 with a turndown in the optical ) .    given the strength of the disc emission in the vhs then it is also rather natural to assume that this is the dominant contributor to the seed photons .",
    "again this contrasts with the low / hard state , where the disc is much weaker , and the jet might be expected to be a more important contributor ( markoff et al 2001 ) . however , even for the low / hard state , the jet models fail to reproduce the detailed shape of the tail ( zdziarski et al 2003 ) , so that the current version of these jet models now have the majority of the x - ray emission produced by comptonisation of the disc and cyclo  synchrotron photons by thermal electrons at the jet base ( markoff et al 2005 ) .",
    "since disc comptonisation appears to be a component of the x - ray continuum even in the low / hard state , this process should be even more dominant with the stronger disc emission seen in the vhs .",
    "thus both the multiwavelength spectral shape and energy dependence of the x - ray variability strongly support a disc comptonisation interpretation of the x - ray tail .",
    "we show in  7 that this is not inconsistent with the presence of high ( or low ) frequency qpo s .",
    "a hot ( and so presumably geometrically thick ) inner disc corona may actually be required to produce the strong jet ( mckinney 2005 ) traced by radio emission during this outburst of xte  j@xmath0 ( corbel et al 2001 ) .",
    "the only obvious inconsistency is with the interpretation of the iron line in these data given by miller et al ( 2004 ) .",
    "however , unlike the comptonisation interpretation of the tail , which seems to be the only viable mechanism , there does exist an alternative explanation for the line shape .",
    "done & gierliski ( 2005 ) show that the asca spectrum in the second vhs observation used here can be fit equally well by much less extreme line smearing if there is also some ionized absorption present .",
    "the underlying iron line width is then reduced , consistent with originating from reflection in the outer disc , which allows the inner disc to be mostly covered by the corona .",
    "thus there are no data which unambiguously rule out an optically thick inner disc corona , while there are many observations which strongly support its existence .",
    "such a corona will inevitably distort the disc spectrum in the ways explored in this paper .",
    "we investigate the broadband continuum spectra of two vhs observations covering 0.8200  kev .",
    "these have a strong x - ray tail , contributing more than half of the total bolometric luminosity of the source .",
    "the disc in these spectra has an apparent temperature which is much lower than that seen from the same source at the same luminosity in the disc dominated high / soft state .",
    "we show that this is not simply produced by the effect of an optically thick corona hiding the emission from the inner disc , but instead requires that the disc changes in some way from that seen in the high / soft state , either in area ( fig .  [ fig : sketch2]a ) , emissivity ( fig .  [ fig : sketch2]b ) or both ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch2]c ) .",
    "the most obvious change in these spectra is that there is now a corona .",
    "energetically , this must be powered ultimately by the accretion flow , so there is less power available for the disc itself .",
    "we build a specific example of disc - corona coupling , where the corona over the inner disc drains power from the disc material under it , changing its emissivity ( svensson & zdziarski 1996 ) .",
    "we show that this reduces the amount of disc truncation required , to a level where it is probably not significant given the model uncertainties e.g. if some fraction of the accreting mass goes through the corona as well as some fraction of the power , or if the geometry of the corona is more quasi - spherical than slab - like",
    ". however , we marginally favour the coupled disc - corona system with a slightly truncated disc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch2]c ) as this can simultaneously explain the lf qpo in the relativistic disc precession model .",
    "however , since there is as yet no clear consensus on models of qpo formation , this can not give unambiguous information on disc radii .",
    "thus fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch2]b , where the disc area ( though not its properties ! ) is unchanged from the disc dominated states is also consistent with the spectra , though this leaves the change in lf qpo as an open question .",
    "conversely , a large truncation radius with continuous corona ( fig .  [ fig : sketch2]a ) _ is _ ruled out by the _",
    "steep _ comptonised spectrum seen .    however , we stress that irrespective of the specific model , the strong comptonisation seen in these very high state data clearly requires that the underlying disc properties are rather different to those of a disc without a corona .",
    "unsurprisingly , the data require that the disc structure _ changes _ in response to whatever changing dissipation mode powers the growth of the coronal structure .",
    "we also stress that these vhs spectra are very similar to those seen from several ulx in terms of having a very low apparent disc temperature for their luminosity .",
    "this has been interpreted as evidence for intermediate mass black holes in the ulx , of order @xmath36 ( miller , fabian & miller 2004 ) .",
    "obviously this is not an option in xte  j@xmath0 , where the black hole mass is constrained by dynamical studies to be a normal stellar remnant black hole mass of order @xmath37 ( orosz et al 2002 ) .",
    "we suggest that the same process , of a corona draining energy from the inner disc , may be operating in these ulx .",
    "many of these would then be compatible with fairly normal binary systems , where the black hole mass is at the upper end of that which can reasonably form from models of stellar collapse ( typically @xmath38 or up to @xmath39 from recent calculations of binary evolution ; belczynski et al .",

    "<S> we use simultaneous optical - asca - rxte data from the black hole transient xte  j@xmath0 as a specific example of two such spectra , where the power emitted in the tail is more than 50 per cent of the bolometric luminosity . these have disc spectra which are significantly lower in temperature than those seen from the same source at the same luminosity in the high / soft state . </S>",
    "<S> if these give a true picture of the disc then either the disc emissivity has reduced , and/or the disc truncates above the last stable orbit .    </S>",
    "<S> however , it is often assumed that the tail is produced by compton scattering , in which case its shape in these spectra requires that the comptonising region is marginally optically thick ( @xmath1  23 ) , and covers a large fraction of the inner disc . </S>",
    "<S> this will distort our view of the disc , especially of the hottest temperature material . </S>",
    "<S> we build a theoretical model of a comptonising corona over an inner disc , and fit this to the data , but find that it still requires a large increase in inner disc radius for a standard disc emissivity . </S>",
    "<S> instead it seems more probable that the disc emissivity _ changes _ in the presence of the corona . </S>",
    "<S> we implement the specific inner disc - corona coupling model of svensson & zdziarski ( 1994 ) , in which some fraction @xmath2 of the accretion power is dissipated in the corona leaving only a fraction @xmath3 to be dissipated in the optically thick disc . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this can explain the low temperature / high luminosity disc emission seen in the very high state with only a small increase in radius of the disc . while this inferred disc truncation is probably not significant given the model uncertainties , it is consistent with the low frequency qpo and gives continuity of properties with the low / hard state spectra .    </S>",
