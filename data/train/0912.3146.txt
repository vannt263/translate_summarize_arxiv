    "the soft band ( 0.2@xmath02 kev ) sensitivity limit of the slews ( 6@xmath1ergs @xmath2 s@xmath3 ) is close to that of the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) , and in the medium ( 2@xmath012 kev ) band , the slew data goes significantly deeper ( 4@xmath4ergs @xmath2 s@xmath3 ) than all other previous large area surveys .",
