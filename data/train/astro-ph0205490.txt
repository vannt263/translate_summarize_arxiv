    "the abundance of clusters of galaxies as a function of mass places one of the strongest constraints on the amplitude of mass fluctuations on 8 @xmath12 mpc scale , @xmath2 , and on the mass density parameter , @xmath3 .",
    "the present - day cluster mass function was the first observation to suggest that the standard @xmath3= 1 cold dark matter ( cdm ) model has to be highly biased , with @xmath2@xmath1 0.5 ( i.e. , a bias of @xmath1 2 , since the galaxy fluctuations amplitude is @xmath2@xmath13 @xmath1 1 ) , in order to match the observed cluster abundance .",
    "the cluster mass function also showed that low - density cdm models fit the cluster data well with little or no bias ( i.e. , @xmath2@xmath1 1 ) @xcite .",
    "the mass function constraint , frequently called `` cluster normalization '' because of its powerful constraint on the linear mass power spectrum amplitude @xmath2 , has provided the well known relation @xmath2@xmath3@xmath14 = 0.5 @xmath5 0.05 ; this result was obtained from observations of both the cluster mass function @xcite and from the cluster temperature function @xcite .",
    "this relation implies that @xmath3@xmath1 0.3 if @xmath2@xmath1 0.9 - 1 ; this latter value of @xmath2  is suggested from other observations including cluster abundance evolution ( @xcite , and references therein ) , the flattening of the mass - to - light ratio on large scales @xcite , and the sdss and 2df large scale structure observations @xcite .",
    "similar @xmath2-@xmath3  normalization relations have been recently obtained from weak lensing observations on large scales ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , using new x - ray cluster samples and different virial mass versus temperature relations ( which are critical for a precise determination of the cosmological constraints ) , cluster normalizations that are either considerably lower ( by @xmath1 2@xmath11 ; @xmath2@xmath3@xmath15 0.4 @xmath5 10@xmath16 ) or higher ( @xmath17 0.6 @xmath5 10@xmath16 ) than the above value have been reported ( @xcite ; here we converted all the relations to the same power - law slope of 0.5 for easier comparison ) .",
    "an accurate determination of this parameter is important for two reasons .",
    "first , the normalization @xmath2@xmath18 enters exponentially in the evolution of structure in the universe ; a 20@xmath16 change in @xmath2   has a significant ( exponential ) effect on the evolution of structure with time and , of course , on the amount of bias in the universe ( i.e. , how mass traces light ) .",
    "second , if we know @xmath2  or @xmath3   from other observations , the above relation can be used to determine the second parameter . for example , if @xmath2@xmath1 1 , as suggested by some observations , then the implied value of @xmath3  differs by nearly a factor of two depending on whether the cluster normalization relation is @xmath2 @xmath3@xmath14 = 0.6 @xmath5 10@xmath16 or 0.4 @xmath5 10@xmath16 ; these values imply @xmath3= 0.36 @xmath5 20@xmath16 or 0.16 @xmath5 20@xmath16 , respectively .    most of the previous analyses , which use the cluster temperature function , employ a smaller number of clusters , and assume a relation between virial cluster mass and temperature , which sensitively affects the results .",
    "the cosmological interpretations are generally based on comparisons with theoretical approximations such as the press - schechter formalism .    in this paper we use the early commissioning data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss : @xcite ) to determine a preliminary mass function of nearby clusters of galaxies and derive its cosmological constraints .",
    "the data cover about 400 deg@xmath18 with @xmath1300 clusters at z = 0.1 - 0.2 from each of two independent samples ( @xmath1600 clusters in total )  considerably larger than previous samples .",
    "the analysis does not use cluster virial masses , nor the virial mass temperature relation , which are more difficult to determine observationally .",
    "rather , we use cluster masses observed within a fixed radius , as calibrated from the observed cluster luminosities and tested against cluster velocity dispersion .",
    "we use two independently selected cluster samples , identified by different algorithms  the matched filter method and the color - magnitude maxbcg method ; we find consistent results for the two samples .",
    "we compare the results directly with large scale ( gpc@xmath19 ) cosmological simulations as well as with the press - schechter formalism to determine the cosmological constraints .",
    "finally , we note that the current results are based on a very small fraction ( 4@xmath16 ) of the ultimate sdss 10@xmath20 deg@xmath18 survey , which will yield thousands of clusters , many with velocity dispersions and weak gravitational lensing masses .",
    "the present mass function is therefore preliminary , intended to show the feasibility of using clusters from sdss by utilizing the early commissioning data ; larger and more accurate data will become available from sdss in the near future .",
    "the sdss @xcite is a 5-band ccd imaging survey that will cover , when complete , 10@xmath21 deg@xmath18 of the high latitude north galactic cap , and a smaller deeper region in the south , followed by an extensive multi - fiber spectroscopic survey .",
    "the imaging survey is carried out in drift - scan mode in five sdss filters , u , g , r , i , z , to a limiting point source magnitude of r@xmath2223 @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic survey will target nearly one million galaxies to approximately r@xmath2217.7 , with a median redshift of z@xmath10.1 @xcite , and a smaller deeper sample of @xmath1 10@xmath23 luminous red galaxies to r@xmath119 and z@xmath10.5 @xcite .",
    "in this paper we use 379 deg@xmath18 of the early commissioning data of sdss imaging , covering the area @xmath24(2000 ) = 355.0to 56.0 , @xmath25(2000 ) = -1.25to 1.25 ; and @xmath24(2000 ) = 145.3to 236.0 , @xmath25(2000)= -1.25to 1.25  ( runs 94/125 and 752/756 ; @xcite ) .",
    "clusters of galaxies were selected from these imaging data using , among others , a matched - filter method @xcite and an independent color - magnitude maximum - likelihood brightest cluster galaxy method ( maxbcg ; @xcite ) .",
    "these methods are briefly described below .",
    "a detailed comparison between these independent cluster selection methods and their properties is given in @xcite .",
    "here we use clusters selected from these techniques to determine a preliminary mass function of nearby clusters of galaxies .",
    "the matched filter method hmf ( hybrid matched filter ; @xcite ) is a hybrid of the matched filter @xcite and the adaptive matched filter techniques @xcite .",
    "this method identifies clusters in imaging data by finding peaks in a cluster likelihood map generated by convolving the galaxy survey with a filter based on a model of the cluster and field galaxy distribution .",
    "the cluster filter is composed of a projected density profile model for the galaxy distribution ( plummer law profile ) , and a luminosity function filter ( schechter function ) , using the typical parameters observed for galaxy clusters ( within a radius of 1 @xmath12 mpc ) .",
    "the hmf method identifies the highest likelihood clusters in the imaging data and determines their best - fit estimated redshift ( z@xmath26 ) and richness ( @xmath27 ) ; the best - fit richness is proportional to the total cluster maximum likelihood luminosity within a radius of 1 @xmath12 mpc .",
    "a relatively high threshold has been applied to the hmf cluster selection ( @xmath285.2 , @xcite ) ; therefore , the selected clusters have typical richness of @xmath27@xmath29 20 - 30 ( i.e. , l@xmath30(@xmath22 1@xmath12 mpc ) @xmath29 20l@xmath312@xmath3210@xmath33 @xmath34 l@xmath35 ) .",
    "this threshold corresponds to clusters poorer than abell richness class 0 .",
    "( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "the maxbcg method @xcite is based on the fact that the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) generally lies in a narrowly defined space in luminosity and color ( see , e.g , @xcite ) . for each sdss galaxy",
    ", a bcg likelihood is calculated as a function of redshift based on the galaxy color ( @xmath36-@xmath37 and @xmath37-@xmath38 ) and magnitude .",
    "the cluster likelihood is then weighted by the number of nearby red galaxies ( located within 1 @xmath12 mpc projected separation ) that are within the color - magnitude region expected for the relevant cluster e / s0 galaxy ridgeline .",
    "this combined likelihood is used for cluster identification .",
    "the likelihood is calculated as a function of redshift from z = 0 to 0.5 , at 0.01 intervals .",
    "the best estimated redshift is that which maximizes the cluster likelihood .",
    "since elliptical galaxies possess very regular colors , they provide excellent photometric redshift estimates for their parent clusters .",
    "the richness estimator , @xmath39 , is defined as the number of red e / s0 ridgeline member galaxies that are brighter than m@xmath40 = -20.25 ( i.e. , 1 mag fainter than l@xmath41 ; @xmath42 = 1 ) , and are located within a 1 @xmath12 mpc radius of the bcg .",
    "( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "the hmf cluster catalog contains clusters with richness @xmath27@xmath29 20 and redshift z@xmath26 @xmath22 0.5 @xcite .",
    "the selection function for this sample has been determined using simulated clusters ( see above references ) .",
    "the hmf redshift uncertainty is determined to be @xmath43 = 0.03 ( by comparison with measured redshifts , @xcite ) ; the redshift uncertainty of the maxbcg clusters is @xmath44 = 0.02 .    in this paper",
    "we determine the abundance of hmf clusters as a function of richness for nearby clusters ( z = 0.1 - 0.2 ) and use the observed richness - mass relation to determine a preliminary mass function for the hmf clusters .",
    "a similar analysis is carried out for the independently selected maxbcg clusters and the results compared .",
    "each of the independent samples contains @xmath1300 clusters within the redshift ( z = 0.1 - 0.2 ) and richness ( @xmath27@xmath45 30 and @xmath39@xmath45 10 ) limits used in this analysis .",
    "we determine the mass function of nearby clusters of galaxies using hmf clusters with richness @xmath27 @xmath45 30 and redshift z = 0.1 - 0.2 .",
    "( at z @xmath22 0.1 , the number of clusters is small and their selection less effective ; we thus restrict our analysis to the above range . )",
    "to minimize false - positive detections we use the vc1 sample ( visually confirmed sample , @xcite ) which contains @xmath29 80@xmath16 of all @xmath27@xmath45 30 hmf clusters , increasing to @xmath29 90@xmath16 for @xmath27@xmath45 50 clusters .",
    "the total number of vc1 clusters observed within this redshift and richness range is 294 ( uncorrected for selection function ) .",
    "each cluster is corrected by the appropriate selection function for the given cluster richness and redshift as determined from cluster simulations @xcite .",
    "the cluster abundance as a function of richness , from @xmath27@xmath45 30 to @xmath27@xmath45 70 , is obtained by dividing the above volume - limited corrected cluster count by the relevant volume ( z = 0.1 - 0.2 ) . a flat @xmath3= 0.3 cosmology",
    "is assumed for the volume calculation , and a hubble constant of h@xmath46 = 100 @xmath42 km / s / mpc is used .",
    "( when fitting to different cosmologies in section 4 , the proper self - consistent cosmological volume is used for each @xmath3  value . )",
    "two corrections are applied to the cumulative cluster richness function .",
    "first , we correct the abundance of clusters above a given richness , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 @xmath27 ) , for the effect of redshift uncertainty in the hmf clusters , @xmath44 = 0.03 ( see section 2 ) . the correction factor is determined using monte carlo simulations of realistic cluster distribution with redshift and richness , which is convolved with the observed gaussian scatter in redshift , @xmath44 = 0.03 .",
    "we find that the redshift uncertainty has a small effect , causing about 10@xmath16 more clusters to be scattered into the z = 0.1 - 0.2 volume than are scattered out .",
    "we correct the cluster abundances downward by this small correction .",
    "second , we correct the derived cluster abundance for the effect of uncertainty in the hmf richness , estimated to be 20@xmath16 based on cluster simulations .",
    "we use monte carlo simulations with a realistic richness function , convolve it with the known observational selection function to produce the observed number of clusters as a function of true richness and then scatter the richness with the observed uncertainty to yield the observed richness function . comparing the observed and true richness functions in 10@xmath49 simulations we determine the proper correction factors and their dispersion , which we apply to the data .",
    "we find that the observed abundances are larger than the true ones , as expected due to the excess scatter of the more numerous low richness clusters to higher richness ; this effect is 10@xmath16 at @xmath27 @xmath1 30 - 40 , increasing to 35@xmath16 - 55@xmath16 at @xmath27@xmath1 60 - 70 .",
    "we correct the cluster abundances for this effect , and use the observed variance in the final error analysis discussed below .",
    "the uncertainties in the observed cluster abundance include the statistical uncertainties ( n@xmath50 ) , the uncertainties in the selection function ( @xmath515@xmath16 ) and in the false - positive correction ( @xmath515@xmath16 ) , and the uncertainties derived from the monte carlo simulations for each of the two corrections above ( the redshift correction factor has an uncertainty of 4@xmath16 to 42@xmath16 for the range @xmath27@xmath4530 to @xmath27@xmath4570 , and the richness correction factor has an uncertainty of 3@xmath16 to 23@xmath16 for the same range ) .    to determine a cluster mass function from the above cluster richness function we need to convert the cluster richness thresholds to a mean cluster mass .",
    "throughout this paper we use cluster mass within a given fixed radius ( not virial mass ) ; this mass is more accurately obtained from observations since the virial radius is not precisely known .",
    "we convert richness to mass in two independent ways , both from observations .",
    "first , we use the mean cluster luminosity measured in the sdss data for all clusters stacked as a function of their richness .",
    "the cluster luminosity is observed within a radius of 0.6 @xmath12 mpc , in the r - band , for galaxies brighter than m@xmath51 = -19.8 ( k - corrected for each galaxy type following @xcite ) , and corrected for a similarly determined local background in five separate locations ( which allows us to account for the variance in the background correction ; @xcite ) .",
    "we use the mean observed cluster luminosity l@xmath52 for clusters with richness threshold of @xmath27=30 , 40 , 45 , 50 , 60 and 70 .",
    "the observed mean luminosity l@xmath52 of the stacked clusters is presented as a function of richness in figure 1 .",
    "we note that any biases or uncertainties in the richness parameter ( e.g. , @xcite ) are calibrated out in this procedure since the actual mean cluster luminosities are directly measured by this method .",
    "the richness parameter serves only as a tracer ; a richness bias will properly calibrate itself by the measured mean luminosity ( as is in fact seen by the non - linear relation between @xmath53 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "the cluster luminosity is corrected to include the unobserved faint - end of the cluster luminosity function , that is , all galaxies fainter than m@xmath51 = -19.8 .",

    "the cluster mean luminosity is then converted to cluster mass , m(@xmath22 0.6 @xmath12 mpc physical ) , using the mean observed cluster @xmath55 ratio for each richness threshold @xcite .",

    "the mild increase of @xmath56  with temperature , @xmath59 ( seen both in observations and in simulations , e.g. , @xcite ) , is accounted for at each richness threshold using the observed correlation between richness and velocity dispersion ( see below ) and the observed mean relation between velocity dispersion and temparature ( @xmath60= 332 @xmath61 , @xcite ) .",
    "this effect is small for the range of cluster temperatures studied here ( @xmath62 0.9 to 4 kev ) . the mean observed @xmath57 at z=0 is converted to @xmath55 ( where @xmath63 is the relevant sdss petrosian @xmath37 luminosity ) using the conversions given by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the mean mass of clusters ( within 0.6 @xmath12 mpc ) is then determined for the relevant richness thresholds ( @xmath27@xmath4530 to @xmath27@xmath4570 ) .    the uncertainties in the mean mass estimates are derived from the combined uncertainties in the observed mean luminosity - richness relation , the uncertainty in the observed mean @xmath56  ratio , and the smaller uncertainties in the corrections applied above . in order to determine the proper uncertainties in the luminosity - richness relation that are relevant for the mean cluster mass estimates , we generate 10@xmath49 monte carlo simulations with a realistic l-@xmath27  relation and richness function .",

    "we use these uncertainties in estimating cluster mass uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainty in the mean observed @xmath56  ratio , 15@xmath16 for the relevant cluster richnesses , is combined with an additional 8@xmath16 uncertainty in the conversion factors described above and a 6@xmath16 uncertainty in the luminosity function faint end extrapolation ( see above ) .",
    "the mass uncertainties thus range from 20@xmath16 at @xmath27@xmath130 to 31@xmath16 at @xmath27@xmath170 .",

    "in addition , we use the best - fit relation observed between mean cluster velocity dispersion and richness for maxbcg clusters ( 21 clusters with measured dispersions ) as an additional test ; the observed median relation , @xmath60(km / s ) = 93 @xmath39@xmath84 ( figure 4 ) , is used to independently estimate cluster masses using m ( @xmath22 0.6 @xmath12 mpc ) = 0.0717 @xmath76 @xmath77 10@xmath78 @xmath12 m@xmath35 , as described above .",
    "the results of the two methods ( figure 5 ) are consistent with each other .",
    "we can compare the observed cluster mass function with the recently observed cluster temperature function by @xcite .",
    "for this purpose we use the observed relation discussed above , m ( @xmath22 0.6 @xmath12 mpc ) = 0.53 @xmath76 t(kev ) 10@xmath78 @xmath12 m@xmath35 , to derive an approximate temperature function from the above mass function . we find a good agreement between the mass function ( based on 300 clusters at z = 0.1 - 0.2 ) and the ikebe et al . temperature function ( based on 60 x - ray clusters , mostly at z @xmath22 0.1 ) ( accounting for the slightly higher redshift of the sdss sample , in accord with cosmological simulations ; @xcite ) .",
    "the sdss mass function reaches to poorer clusters , of lower temperature ( t @xmath1 1 kev ) , as compared with the x - ray temperature function ( t @xmath29 2 kev ) ; because of the small area covered , the current sdss sample does not contain the most massive clusters these highest mass clusters will become available as the sample size increases .",
    "the agreement between these independent determinations provides further support of the current cluster mass function results .",
    "the cluster mass function places one of the most powerful constraints on the cosmological parameters @xmath3   and @xmath2 ; it determines the important cluster normalization relation , i.e. , the value of @xmath2  as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "early data of the cluster mass function @xcite , and the cluster temperature function @xcite , provided a cluster normalization relation of @xmath2@xmath3@xmath14 @xmath17 0.5 ( @xmath5 @xmath110@xmath16 ; see above references for details ) .",
    "this powerful relation implies that for @xmath2@xmath1 1 , @xmath3@xmath1 0.25 ( with slight differences depending on a flat versus open cosmology ) . for @xmath3= 1",
    ", the required normalization of @xmath2 = 0.5 implies a strong bias which is not supported by observations @xcite .",
    "more recently , using different x - ray cluster samples and different relations between virial mass and cluster temperature , a somewhat lower normalization value has been suggested @xcite , although higher values have also been reported @xcite . in this section",
    "we compare the preliminary mass function of sdss clusters with analytic predictions to determine the best - fit cosmological parameters .    the mass function for a given cosmology",
    "can be predicted using the analytic formalism of @xcite , as in for example @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "while fairly successful in matching the results of n - body simulations , the standard p - s formalism tends to predict too many low mass clusters and too few higher mass clusters .",
    "an improved fitting formula which better reproduces the results of n - body simulations is given by @xcite ; we will use this in preference to the standard p - s formula .    for a given set of cosmological parameters",
    ", we begin by calculating the linear matter power spectrum using the publicly available cmbfast code @xcite . knowing the power spectrum",
    ", we calculate the variance of the linear density field and thus find the mass function with equation b3 of @xcite . as @xcite show",
    ", this formula is appropriate for a definition of cluster mass within a sphere enclosing a mean overdensity which is a fixed multiple of the mean density .",
    "because the hmf and maxbcg masses are instead derived within a fixed radius ( independent of density or mass ) , we adjust the analytic masses using the mass distribution corresponding to the nfw density profile @xcite , which provides an accurate representation of n - body results . to do this",
    "we follow the method presented in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the resulting analytic prediction , using cluster mass within two different radii of 0.5 @xmath12 mpc ( physical ) and 1.5 @xmath12 mpc ( comoving ) , is shown for the concordance model in figure 2 as a dotted line .",
    "this analytic function is in excellent agreement with the direct n - body simulation ( dashed line ) over the relevant range of masses ( though at higher or lower masses the agreement may not be so close ) .    to determine the best - fit mass function and the implied values of @xmath3 and @xmath85",
    ", we compare the differential binned mass function to the above theoretical prediction using a standard @xmath86 procedure .",
    "the last data point in each sample is not included in the best @xmath86 fit determinations since this point contains only a few clusters ( @xmath17 ) with considerably less well determined mass .",
    "only spatially flat models are considered .",
    "the hubble constant is kept fixed at h@xmath87 = 72 km s@xmath75 mpc@xmath75 @xcite , with a baryon density of @xmath88 @xcite , and cmb temperature @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "we assume a primordial power spectral index @xmath90 .",
    "the results , presented in figures 2 , 3 and 5 , show a good agreement between the shape of the observed and theoretical lcdm mass function , but the observed function has a significantly lower normalization than the canonical value of @xmath2@xmath3@xmath14 = 0.5 ( the latter indicated by the dashed and dotted curves in figure 1 , representing the concordance lcdm model with @xmath3= 0.3 and @xmath2= 0.9 ) .",
    "model simulations with a somewhat lower value of @xmath2@xmath3@xmath14 @xmath17 0.45 ( for a flat quintessence model and open cdm , see @xcite ; not shown here to avoid crowding ) also exhibit higher normalization than observed .",
    "the best - fit mass function is presented in figures 2 and 3 for the hmf clusters , and in figure 5 for both the maxbcg and hmf clusters ; the two independent best fit functions yield similar results ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the cosmological constraints derived from the @xmath86 minimization are summarized in figure 6 , showing the allowed parameter range of @xmath3-@xmath2   for both the hmf and the maxbcg samples .",
    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath3= 0.175 @xmath8 , @xmath2= 0.92 @xmath91 ( 1-@xmath11 ) for the hmf clusters , and @xmath3= 0.195 @xmath92 , @xmath2= 0.9 @xmath9 for the maxbcg clusters ( figures 2 , 3 and 5 ) .",
    "the best - fit contours in figure 6 show that high values of @xmath3(@xmath29 0.4 ) and low values of @xmath2(@xmath22 0.6 ) are ruled out by the data at @xmath10 2-@xmath11 ; these yield mass functions that are too steep compared to the data . on the other hand , low values of @xmath3(down to @xmath1 0.1 ) and high values of @xmath2(up to @xmath1 1.2 )",
    "are supported by the data .",
    "these results are obtained using the m(@xmath22 0.6 @xmath12 mpc ) mass functions ; similar results are obtained with m(@xmath22 1.5@xmath12 mpc comoving ) .",
    "the mean best - fit parameters of the observed mass function ( with 1-@xmath11 ) are : @xmath93 @xmath94    the best - fit normalization relation ( figure 6 ) is : @xmath95 or , equivalently , @xmath96    for comparison with previous results , this relation ( 3 ) is 20@xmath16 lower than the standard normalization value of @xmath2@xmath3@xmath14 = 0.5 ( or similarly , @xmath2@xmath3@xmath97 0.44 ) . as discussed earlier , this conclusion has a non - negligible implication for @xmath2   and @xmath3  as seen in equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) for the best - fit parameters ( and discussed below ) .",
    "the results are consistent with the recent temperature function results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the higher amplitude obtained by some of the earlier work is most likely due to a combination of factors including use of the uncertain and sensitive theoretical ( rather than observational ) mass - temperature relation ( when applied to x - ray clusters ) , smaller sample size , and overestimated cluster abundance ( in some optical samples ) .",
    "recent weak lensing observations on large scales yield results that range from @xmath2 @xmath3@xmath14 @xmath1 0.4 to 0.6 ( or @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4 @xmath1 0.34 to 0.52 when converted to a power law slope of 0.6 , at @xmath3@xmath1 0.25 , for easier comparison ; see references in section 1 ) ; the low end of this range is consistent with the current results , but the high normalization values reported are inconsistent at the 2-@xmath11 level",
    ". a complementary analysis of the maxbcg cluster halo occupation function ( annis et al . , in preparation ) yields consistent results with those obtained above .",
    "our best - fit @xmath2-@xmath3  constraints are compared with previous results in figure 7 .",
    "this comparison illustrates the agreement of recent temperature function results with the current constraints , and shows the wide range among the earlier , higher @xmath2(@xmath3 ) normalization results .",
    "the weak lensing analyses yield constraints that lie mostly at the higher @xmath2(@xmath3 ) range ; the lensing results of @xcite are consistent with our current constraints .",
    "this new cluster normalization has important implications for @xmath3 .",
    "it is frequently assumed that @xmath3   is 0.3 , and the above relation is used to determine @xmath2   ( thus typically referred to as `` low normalization '' , implying a lower than expected @xmath2   value for @xmath3= 0.3 )",
    ". however , the value of @xmath3   is not accurately known , and could be as low as @xmath1 0.15 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . at the same time , there are several measurements that suggest that @xmath2@xmath17 0.9 - 1 .",
    "this `` high '' normalization is obtained from the very mild evolution observed in the cluster abundance to z@xmath11 @xcite ; the flattening of the @xmath56  function on large scales @xcite ; sdss observations of the galaxy power spectrum on large scales @xcite ; and the observation of no - bias in the galaxy distribution in the 2df and infrared surveys ( @xcite ; but see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "this observationally suggested normalization of @xmath2@xmath17 0.9 - 1 is fully consistent with our best - fit value for the sdss cluster mass function ( equations 1 and 2 ) ; it implies a low mass density of @xmath3@xmath17 0.19 .",
    "this is also consistent with the low @xmath3  value indicated by the @xmath56  function on large scales .",
    "we determine the mass function of nearby clusters of galaxies using @xmath1 300 clusters at z = 0.1 - 0.2 selected from @xmath1 400 deg@xmath0 of early sdss commissioning data .",
    "two independent cluster samples are used based on the matched filter and the color - magnitude maxbcg methods .",
    "the two samples yield consistent results .",
    "the analysis uses cluster masses within a fixed radius .",
    "the mass function is compared directly with large , gpc@xmath49 cosmological simulations .",

    "this result is significantly lower than the previous canonical value of @xmath2@xmath3@xmath14 = 0.5 @xmath5 0.05 .",
    "the shape of the cluster mass function partially breaks this degeneracy ; we find best - fit parameters of @xmath3= 0.19 @xmath8 and @xmath2= 0.9 @xmath9 .",
    "these values are consistent with the independent observationally suggested normalization of @xmath2@xmath17 0.9 - 1 observed from cluster abundance evolution @xcite , the flattening of the @xmath56  function on large scales @xcite , and sdss , 2df , and infrared large - scale structure observations @xcite .",
    "these preliminary results from early commissioning data of 4@xmath16 of the ultimate sdss survey will be greatly improved as additional sdss data become available for thousands of clusters , many with measured velocity dispersions and weak lensing masses .",
