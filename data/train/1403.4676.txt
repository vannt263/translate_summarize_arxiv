    "such a dissipative dynamics can be engineered by manipulating couplings of the lattice to different atomic species , which play the role of the dissipative bath@xcite .      to derive the hall conductance of an open system ,",

    "these two parts also manifest in the hall conductivity discussed below , suggesting us to define a _",
    "topological _ value called chern rate for the system .    the hall conductivity , defined as the ratio of the hall current density @xmath100 and the electronic field @xmath101 , is therefore given by @xmath102 here    @xmath103    to derive these results , @xmath104 has been used .",
    "this is one of the main result of this work .",
    "it is worth pointing out that this result sharply depends on the decoherence mechanism .",
    "in fact , as we will show later in the two - band model , the hall conductivity is not a mixture of hall conductivities for various steady bands .",
    "assume @xmath105 independent of @xmath65 and @xmath106 , the integral on the right hand side of @xmath107 , i.e. , @xmath108 is nothing but the chern number which takes integer values as pointed out in@xcite .",
    "then @xmath107 can be written as @xmath109 @xmath107 is a weighted chern number for the two steady bands .",

    "@xmath111 consists of two parts , @xmath112 here , @xmath113 and @xmath114 describe respectively the first order and second order corrections of the decoherence to the hall conductivity . they can not be written in terms of chern number in general , since both @xmath115 and the energy gap depend on band index .",
    "therefore , there is no topological invariance for the open system from the viewpoint of hall conductivity , this is true even when the dissipation rates @xmath29 and the band gaps are independent of band index , @xmath114 can be expressed in terms of chern numbers in this case , but @xmath113 still can not .",
    "the hall current given by @xmath111 characterizes the environmental activation of excited electrons in the bulk , and it is not zero in the regions outside the topological regime , where @xmath116 .",
    "this can be found in eq .",
    "( [ 1thhall ] ) .",
    "these observations motivate us to define a topological value , to which we will refer as chern rate , @xmath117 we adopt terminology chern rate for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , it possesses topological origin ; secondly , it may not take an integer for a general open system ; thirdly , it should differ from the chern value defined in ref.@xcite , and in addition the hall conductance is simply a multiple of the chern rate and @xmath118 . of cause , the chern rate returns back to the chern number when the system is an isolated topological insulator .",
    "it is well known that bloch s waves @xmath119 under time - reversal transformation take @xmath120 , then the berry curvature defined by @xmath121 under the time - reversal transformation satisfies , @xmath122 .",
    "so , for system with time reversal symmetry , @xmath123 is an odd function of @xmath124 . as a consequence ,",
    "the chern number for a time - reversal invariant system is zero , because the integral of an odd function over the whole brillouin zone must be zero .",
    "this is not the case for second line in eq .",
    "( [ 1thhall ] ) that is an even function of @xmath125 .",
    "this fact reflects that the second line in eq .",
    "( [ 1thhall ] ) may not be zero for a time - reversally invariant system , and hence the chern rate loses partially its topological origin in this case .",
    "we will illustrate below that this non - topological term can be eliminated by properly designing @xmath126 and @xmath127 in eq .",

    "this difference would manifest in the hall conductivity , for example , the hall conductivity is not a mixture of hall conductivities for various bands .",
