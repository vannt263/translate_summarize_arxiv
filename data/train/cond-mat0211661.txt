    "so far , bose - einstein condensates have only been produced in a pulsed mode . to this respect ,",
    "the achievement of a continuous beam operating in the quantum degenerate regime remains a real challenge .",
    "this would be the matter wave equivalent of a cw monochromatic laser and it would allow for unprecedented performance in terms of focalization or collimation .",
    "recently the mit group has demonstrated the periodic replenishment of an optical trap @xcite .",
    "this technique can therefore be used in future experiments in combination with an appropriate outcoupler to continuously release atoms from the trap , and hence to obtain a truly cw atom laser .    another possible way to achieve this goal has been studied theoretically in @xcite . in this proposal , a non - degenerate , but already slow and cold beam of particles , is injected into a magnetic guide @xcite where transverse evaporation takes place . if the elastic collision rate is large enough , efficient evaporative cooling will lead to quantum degeneracy after a propagation length in the guide compatible with experimental constraints ( _ i.e. _ a few meters ) .",
    "the continuous and pulsed loading of a slow and cold atomic beam into a magnetic guide has been recently demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , the collision rate is not sufficient so far to initiate the evaporative cooling stage .    in this article",
    ", we start with summarizing the experimental techniques already developed for atom guiding . to achieve conditions favorable to evaporative cooling one has to maximize the collision rate . for that purpose , we describe quantitatively two possible manipulations of a guided thermal beam : constriction and tilting of the guide .",
    "we then study the role of interactions on a beam of bose - condensed atoms propagating through a constriction .",
    "in recent years , many experimental groups have designed both macroscopic and microscopic guides for transporting laser - cooled atoms . in those guides ,",
    "the confinement is provided by means of conservative forces .",
    "so far the dipole and magnetic forces have been used .    in past years",
    ", atomic transport by means of hollow optical fibers has been achieved @xcite . in this scheme atoms",
    "are guided by the optical dipole force .",
    "however , the heating of atoms through intensity fluctuations and spontaneous emission may be a problem .",
    "an alternative way consists in using magnetic guides . for alkali atoms ,",
    "magnetic forces are strong since the magnetic moment @xmath0 is of the order of the bohr magneton @xmath1 .",
    "as the thermal energy of laser - cooled alkali atoms ( microkelvin range ) is generally much less than the ground - state hyperfine splitting ( @xmath2 ghz corresponds to 48 mk ) , we can assume that the field explored in the guide produces a linear zeeman shift proportional to the hyperfine @xmath3-factor @xmath4 .",
    "we also assume that the the spin adiabatically follows the magnetic field , yielding an effective potential @xmath5 .",
    "depending on the atom s magnetic sublevel @xmath6 ( positive or negative ) , atoms are attracted towards or repelled from a magnetic extremum .",
    "actually , maxwell s equations for magnetostatics only allow for the realization of a minimum of static magnetic fields in vacuum @xcite .",
    "therefore , only low - field seekers can be trapped with inhomogeneous static magnetic fields . as a consequence ,",
    "the atoms are not trapped in the energetically lowest state .",
    "this effect and the three - body recombination are responsible for the metastability of the confined gas .",
    "quadrupole guides can be produced by means of four wires or tubes equally spaced on a cylinder of radius @xmath7 and carrying currents @xmath8 and @xmath9 alternatively .",
    "the magnetic field is quadrupolar and is well approximated by the linear form : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the distance from the @xmath12 axis and @xmath13 the strength of the magnetic gradient . in this configuration ,",
    "atoms with low angular momentum are not stable against spin flips . to avoid this loss mechanism ,",
    "one superimposes a bias field @xmath14 along the axis of the guide .",
    "note that in this case the field strength no longer varies linearly with radius but is given by @xmath15 the taylor expansion around the center yields a quadratic variation of the field strength .",
    "the potential experienced by the atoms is therefore harmonic provided that their temperature @xmath16 fulfills the condition @xmath17 .",
    "a constriction in the potential can be created by reducing the spacing between the wires of the guide and/or decreasing the longitudinal bias field .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the elastic collision rate @xmath18 in the sample must be high enough at the entrance of magnetic guide to start an efficient evaporative cooling @xcite .",
    "we study in this section two ways of increasing @xmath18 in the classical regime for a beam of particles propagating through the guide .",
    "both methods ensure the conservation of phase space density .",
    "the first one consists in a constriction of the transverse confining potential , while the second relies on gravity to slow down the beam by tilting the guide with respect to the horizontal plane .        before studying the physics of a beam in the hydrodynamic regime ,",
    "it is worthwhile to examine the one - particle motion in a constricted guide , in order to gain physical insight .",
    "we therefore write the equation of motion along @xmath12 for a particle with mass @xmath19 in the power law transverse potential @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the @xmath12-dependent strength of the transverse confinement , @xmath22 equation ( [ eqzpoint ] ) shows that the constriction induces a transfer of longitudinal energy into the transverse motion . for a smooth constriction , the motion is adiabatic @xcite and consequently the quantity @xmath23 is constant , where @xmath24 denotes the transverse energy . as the total energy @xmath25 is also conserved , the decrease in longitudinal velocity can easily be related to the increase in @xmath26 .",
    "we notice that the effect of the constriction is more dramatic for particles having a high transverse energy , and is absent for a particle propagating along the axis .",
    "we now assume that there are enough collisions to ensure local thermodynamical equilibrium . from appendix [ b ]",

    "we now consider that the guide axis @xmath12 is tilted by an angle @xmath43 with respect to the horizontal plane . the strength @xmath26 of the transverse confining potential is assumed constant . by tilting the guide , the mean velocity of the beam decreases while the linear density and the temperature increase , resulting in an increase of the collision rate .",
