    "today , there is a strong belief for the existence of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "recent super - kamiokande @xcite and sno @xcite results are considered as strong evidence in favor of oscillations of the atmospheric and solar neutrinos , i.e. in favor of neutrino masses and mixing . by making phenomenologically viable assumptions different predictions for the mass spectrum of light neutrinos",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the problem of the neutrino masses can not be solved without complementary information from the side of the neutrinoless double beta decay . at present ,",
    "the lower limits on the half - life of the neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0-decay ) and thus the upper limit of effective electron neutrino mass @xmath2 allows to discriminate among different neutrino mixing scenarios @xcite . in these analysis one assumes the dominance of the conventional @xmath0-decay mechanism via the exchange of light majorana neutrinos between the decaying neutrons .",
    "the neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite , @xmath3 converting a nucleus ( a , z ) into ( a , z+2 ) under emission of two electrons , violates the lepton number by two units and is forbidden in the standard model ( sm ) . any experimental evidence for this rare nuclear process will constitute evidence for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "essential progress in the exploration of the decay both from theoretical and experimental sides has been achieved in the last few years .",
    "the considerably improved experimental lower bounds on the half - life of various isotopes enhance the potential of testing the different concepts of physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-decay has been found to be a probe of all kinds of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "indeed the existing lower limits on this process imply very stringent constraints on new physics scenarios such as the left - right symmetric models , supersymmetric ( susy ) models with r - parity violation and many others .",
    "the grand unified theories ( gut ) and r - parity violating susy models offer a plethora of the @xmath0-decay mechanisms triggered by exchange of neutrinos , neutralinos , gluinos , leptoquarks , etc .",
    "if the @xmath0-decay will be observed in one of the current or planned experiments , the main issue will be what is the dominant mechanism of this process .",
    "it has been shown by doi et al .",
    "@xcite that it is possible to distinguish the light and heavy majorana neutrino mass mechanisms of the @xmath0-decay from those induced by the right - handed currents by measuring the differential characteristics as well as the transitions to the @xmath4 excited state",
    ". however , there is a class of @xmath0-decay mechanisms , which one can not distinguish from each other kinematically .",
    "the light and heavy majorana neutrino mass and the trilinear r - parity breaking mechanisms constitute such a group . in this contribution we shall discuss in details the possibility to distinguish among them experimentally",
    ". we shall show that it is possible to do it by measuring both the transitions to the first excited @xmath5 and to the @xmath6 ground states .",
    "we note that by measuring only @xmath0-decay transitions to the ground state one can not distinguish among these mechanisms even in the case the experimental results for more isotopes are known as the ratios of nuclear matrix elements for different nuclei associated with different mechanisms do not differ by each from other @xcite .",
    "the half - life of the @xmath0-decay to a @xmath1 final state associated with the above mentioned mechanisms is partly dictated by the nuclear matrix element @xmath7 , partly by the phase space factor @xmath8 and partly by the lepton number violating parameter @xmath9 . in our analysis",
    "we shall assume that one mechanism of the @xmath0-decay at a time dominates .",

    "the ratio @xmath12 of the @xmath0-decay half - lifes for the transition to the first excited @xmath5 and to the ground state is free of unknown parameters from the particle physics side .",
    "we have @xmath13 we see that the ratio @xmath12 can be factorized as product of two factors , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the factor @xmath14 , which is given as ratio of phase space integrals for transitions to ground and excited states , is larger than unity due to the smaller q value for the transition to the excited state , where the available phase space is reduced .",
    "we note that this factor is the same for all @xmath0-decay mechanisms considered . on the other side ,",
    "the squared ratio of the corresponding nuclear matrix elements @xmath15 is strongly depending on the specific @xmath0-decay mechanism .",
    "the two - nucleon exchange potentials associated with the light and heavy majorana neutrino mass mechanisms as well as with the trilinear r - parity breaking susy mechanism of the @xmath0-decay differ considerably by each of other ( see fig . [ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "their form will be given in the forthcoming sections .    from the above discussion",
    ", we therefore conclude that the ratio @xmath12 for a given isotope depends on the specific @xmath0-decay mechanism .",
    "its value can be determined both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the theoretical study requires the evaluation of kinematical factors and the reliable calculation of nuclear matrix elements involved for different @xmath0-decay mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the experimental determination of @xmath12 is difficult as it requires the observation of transition to the @xmath1 excited and to the ground state .",
    "however , its measurement makes it possible to decide , which of the @xmath0-decay mechanisms is the dominant one .",
