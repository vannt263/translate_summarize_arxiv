    "a theoretically meaningful extraction of @xmath24 from @xmath14 and @xmath25 would require a relatively handy and accurate multiple - scattering ( ms ) approximation to the more involved coupled - channel faddeev calculation of the @xmath0 system at low energy .",
    "several faddeev calculations of this sort have been reported.@xcite@xcite however , although the subject of ms approximations to the @xmath0 scattering length has been discussed extensively in recent years,@xcite@xcite only _ one _ of these works produced a correct expression@xcite within the commonly used ` fixed - center ' assumption for the nucleons , with a follow up recently in ref .  .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to review the existing ms approximations and to propose a new ms approximation for @xmath25 .",
    "the proposed version goes beyond the ` fixed - center ' assumption .",
    "this should enable one to make a reasonable prediction for the @xmath0 atom @xmath3 level- shift and width on the basis of given values of @xmath14 and @xmath24 without having to perform new time - consuming faddeev calculations or , _ vice - versa _ , to derive fairly reliably @xmath24 from the joint measurement of the @xmath3 level- shift and width in @xmath4 and @xmath0 atoms .",
    "it was shown in the first fully reactive @xmath1 ( @xmath26 ) faddeev calculation@xcite that @xmath25 may be approximated to a few percent by neglecting the hyperonic channels altogether , in accordance with the conjecture by schick and gibson,@xcite provided the input to the @xmath27 faddeev equations consists of @xmath6 t matrices which implicitly account for the @xmath28 coupling .",

    "the @xmath33 matrix which reduces in the limit of zero kinetic energy to the @xmath0 scattering length , up to a kinematical factor , is @xmath43 .",
    "we now outline several ms approximations , progressively by order of complexity , beginning with the brueckner formula@xcite which was motivated by @xmath44 scattering for static nucleons .",
    "charge - exchange degrees of freedom are then introduced and , wherever charge independence holds , the brueckner formula is generalized in terms of isoscalar and isovector meson - nuclear scattering lengths .",

    "( [ eq : t ] ) , @xmath45 and treating the nucleons as fixed centers .",
    "furthermore , mostly for the sake of illustration , the charge - exchange two - body channel @xmath46 is switched off , leading to the following expression : @xmath47    for zero - range interactions , and considering the necessary kinematical factors to transform from @xmath48 matrices to scattering lengths @xmath49 , it is straightforward to obtain from eq .",

    "the numerator in the brueckner formula consists of single- and double - scattering terms , whereas the denominator provides for the renormalization of these terms to include all the higher - order scattering terms .",
    "the relevant expansion parameter is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 for the deuteron wavefunction .",
    "hence , this series faces divergence once the scattering length is of order @xmath58  fm or more , as we encounter for the @xmath59 channel .",

    "the renormalized tpe value for @xmath85 was used.@xcite the resulting value of @xmath25 is sensitive to the value used for this matrix element which diverges unless renormalized ; scaling it down from @xmath86 by the ratio of @xmath87 , we get @xmath88  fm , in better agreement with the faddeev value  @xmath89  fm.@xcite    in table  [ tab : ms ] we list two ms evaluations of @xmath25 using a deuteron wavefunction based on the paris potential and @xmath6 input which is similar to that used in the tdd@xcite faddeev calculation .",
    "the accuracy of these ms evaluations is typically @xmath90 .",
    "also listed is our own ms approximation ( from table  [ tab : fad ] ) which , perhaps fortuitously , works to about @xmath91 .      under the ` fixed center ' assumption we have suppressed the terms @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the coupled faddeev equations for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , in eq .  ( [ eq : t ] ) .",

    "in this talk i have surveyed schematically the derivation of ms approximations to the few available fully - reactive faddeev calculations for @xmath25 under the generally accepted practice of treating the nucleons as fixed centers . these ` fixed center ' ms approximations , which provide an excellent approximation scheme already at the double - scattering order for @xmath69 , require the full summation of the ms series for @xmath25 , using eq .",

    "the accuracy thus provided is in the range of @xmath104 .",
    "it should be stressed that effective field theory approaches do not yet offer any alternative scheme at present.@xcite i have subsequently outlined a theoretical ms approach for going beyond the ` fixed center ' assumption while keeping the formal appearance of the ` fixed center ' ms formulae , at the expense of renormalizing the input @xmath6 scattering amplitude and the free green s function which for fixed centers gives rise to the @xmath79 dependence of the ms series terms .",

    "the aim of this project is to free oneself of depending on available faddeev calculations , which might become obsolete if the dear measurement@xcite of the @xmath4 atomic @xmath3 level shift and width is confirmed and the error bars further reduced , since _ all _ the published faddeev calculations of @xmath25 use considerably larger values for the @xmath14 input .",
