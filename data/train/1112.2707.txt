    "a small fraction of double - lobed extragalactic radio sources have long , centro - symmetric tails of radio emission extending from the nucleus or primary lobes in a very different direction , thereby producing `` x '' or `` z''-shaped radio galaxies ( xrgs / zrgs ) .",
    "the tails , or `` wings '' , are faint , do not currently harbor a relativistic jet , and can be substantially longer ( in projection ) than the primary lobes .",
    "they have elicited considerable interest due to the suggestion by @xcite that they result from a recent supermassive black hole ( smbh ) merger that reoriented the jet , but their origin is uncertain .",
    "it has also been suggested that the wings result from the deflection of lobe plasma by pressure fronts in the intergalactic or intracluster medium ( igm / icm ) @xcite .",
    "neither of these hypotheses have yet been proven , even in a single source .",
    "b2  0055 + 26 is a dramatic xrg / zrg , with wings longer ( in projection ) than the primary lobes ( figure  [ radio_maps ] ) .",
    "the wings are highly collimated over @xmath0100  kpc .",
    "its host galaxy is the northern component of the dumbbell ngc  326 @xcite and the entire system resides in the galaxy cluster zw  0056.9 + 2636 @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we adopt the convention in the literature and refer to the whole system as ngc  326 .",
    "the cluster atmosphere has been characterized by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , w95 ) on large scales using rosat , and has an average temperature of @xmath1  kev .",
    "the cluster atmosphere is substantially asymmetric ( figure  [ rosat ] ) , suggesting that it is not in hydrostatic equilibrium and may be made up of two or more merging subclusters or that it is a composite of two or three poorer clusters seen in projection ( w95 ) .",
    "a detailed multifrequency study of the radio emission measured the spectral index @xmath2 as a function of position in the lobes and wings , finding spectral steepening in the wings and away from the ends of the jets ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m01 ) .    owing to its dramatic structure ( figure  [ radio_maps ] ) , ngc  326",
    "is frequently used as the prototypical xrg / zrg in formation models purporting to explain the x - shaped morphology .",
    "@xcite , who discovered the wings but not their true length , attributed them to ongoing regular precession of the relativistic jet inflating the primary lobes .",
    "later , @xcite argued that the striking x - shaped structure necessitated rapid secular precession . noting that black holes are difficult to reorient via external forces other than accretion disk instabilities , @xcite suggested instead that the x - shaped structure is the result of the final coalescence of a smbh binary . supposing that the components of the binary have misaligned angular momenta , the final spin axis ( and jet axis ) will be nearly instantaneously reoriented .",
    "@xcite also argued in favor of a single rapid jet reorientation caused by a close encounter between the constituents of the dumbbell galaxy .",
    "based on the large - scale , hot , asymmetric cluster atmosphere , w95 found that the buoyancy of the lobe material could explain the wings provided that they were driven by rapid backflows expected near the terminal shocks of the radio jet heads .",
    "this scenario is fundamentally different from those above in that it presumes a stable jet axis . in support of the backflow hypothesis , we @xcite reported a local asymmetric enhancement of the hot gas in a preliminary analysis of an archival 100  ks _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( cxo ) image on the scale of @xmath05075  kpc where the radio beam is aligned with the major axis and the wings with the minor axis .",
    "this is also consistent with the expectation of @xcite that x - shaped sources are aware of the geometry of their environments .",
    "however , it is not clear how the wings would grow so long in these models .    in this paper",
    ", we carefully consider the high - resolution cxo data in order to shed light on the history of ngc  326 , evalauting possible hydrodynamic hypotheses and characterizing the interaction between the radio galaxy and its environment , which could not be resolved in the w95 study .",

    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we describe the cxo observation , data , and basic features , then in section  3 we use the x - ray and radio data to derive quantities of interest related to the radio galaxy . in section  4",
    "we use these data to reconstruct the history of the radio galaxy and argue that ngc  326 , as well as other xrgs , are interesting sources with regard to feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "we summarize our results in section  5 .",
    "ngc 326 was observed on 2006 - 09 - 02 for 94.4  ks by cxo using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) with the dumbbell galaxies located at the nominal aimpoint on the s3 chip ( obs .",

    "were detected in the lightcurve of low surface brightness regions on the s3 chip or empty regions on other chips ( the entire s3 chip is covered by some cluster emission ) .",
    "for spectral fitting we used xspec v12.7.0 @xcite , with the apec model as our thermal model @xcite .",
    "images produced from the reduced events file were exposure corrected using an exposure map generated in ciao , and questionable pixels at the very edge of the chip which result from this process are excised from our analysis . for analysis of the hot cluster atmosphere ,",
    "point sources are excised from the image using the ciao wavdetect tool .",
    "we also exclude the resolved interstellar media ( ism ) of the dumbbell galaxies .",
    "since the cluster emission extends north onto the s2 chip , we follow an analogous procedure for these data .",
    "in addition to the cxo data , we used archival nrao _ very large array _ ( vla ) radio maps presented in m01 .",
    "these include maps at 1.4 , 1.6 , 4.8 , 8.5 , and 14.9  ghz produced with the nrao aips software .",
    "re - reduction of one ( post - calibration ) dataset with the newer casa software produced no significant differences .",
    "as described in m01 , the angular size of the source is comparable to the size of a vla antenna , so two pointings are combined to form the final image .",
    "the dumbbell system ngc  326 itself has been observed with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) as a snapshot observation @xcite , and there is archival rosat data ( w95 ) .        in the rosat pspc image ( figure  [ rosat ] ) the x - ray peak coincides with the radio galaxy but is not near the center of the cluster ( w95 ) .",
    "the rosat image does not have point sources subtracted ; the bright spot near the southeast edge of the cxo s3 chip is a point source subtracted in the cxo image shown in figure  [ rosat ] .",
    "the cxo image reveals a significant local anisotropic enhancement in the soft x - rays near this peak elongated in the direction of the primary lobes @xcite that can not be seen in the rosat image .",
    "in fact , the rosat x - ray peak is cospatial with the northern lobe of the radio galaxy and _ not _ with the dumbbell galaxies ; these galaxies are visible in the cxo image but on scales much smaller than the rosat point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the cxo image resolves the constituents of the dumbbell ngc  326 ( figure  [ ism ] , smoothed x - ray contours overlaid in green ) .",

    "presumably a higher temperature contribution would come from the projected icm , but this is not a satisfactory explanation because the excess high - energy photons that require the higher temperature or power law component are concentrated inside the psf at the location of the radio point source .",
    "meanwhile , photons outside the half - power distance of the psf are preferentially _ softer _ , suggesting that they are really part of the extended ism . an agn origin for the harder x - ray emission is therefore favored .",

    "the aimpoint for the observation was on the s3 chip , so it is difficult to identify and excise point sources on the i2 and i3 chips . while bright point sources are still detected with algorithms such as wavdetect , faint point sources are distributed over many pixels and are difficult to distinguish from the cluster atmosphere or the background .",

    "our value of @xmath28 is consistent with the w95 value , but they find a core radius @xmath36  kpc in wmap cosmology .",
    "this may be due to the larger field of view of the rosat image and the fact that our background annulus encompasses some cluster emission .",
    "there is also obvious anisotropy in the cluster on the scale of the s3 chip ( figure  [ rosat ] ) , so our fit is only a good description of the atmosphere in the vicinity of ngc  326 . since the x - ray emission may be a superposition of multiple clusters or groups ( w95 ) , we may be isolating group - scale gas associated with ngc  326 .",
    "w95 measured a cluster temperature of approximately 2  kev and a metallicity of 0.3  times solar from the rosat data .",
    "the cxo data is largely in agreement , with temperatures ranging from @xmath37  kev near the core to @xmath38  kev near the edge of the cluster .",
    "however , a temperature map made using weighted voronoi tessellations to adaptively bin the images into bins with @xmath39 @xcite shows a `` front '' of high - temperature plasma to the southeast of the radio galaxy ( figure  [ tempmap ] ) . the temperatures in bins in this front range from @xmath40  kev for a fixed metallicity of @xmath41 ( w95 ) .",
    "the temperature is not well constrained , but no acceptable fits were found below @xmath42  kev for different bin sizes , metallicities , or 2-t fits .    another way to estimate temperatures in the front is to `` deproject '' the emission by assuming a spherical atmosphere ( within 100  kpc of ngc  326 ) and using annuli to break the emission into multiple bins . in this assumed geometry , a line of sight through the center sees a superposition of all the cluster emission , whereas a line of sight near the edge sees only the emission from the outskirts .",
    "thus , each annulus is corrected for the annuli exterior to it , hopefully mitigating the effects of projection . since the high - temperature front is about 70  arcsec from the core and the core radius",
    "is @xmath43  arcsec , we would expect significant contamination and that the deprojected temperature would be higher .",
    "this is indeed what we find ( figure  [ radial_profile ] ) , but we lack the counts to decisively bound the temperature .",
    "since a power law model is not a good fit , the detection of hot plasma southeast of the radio source seems secure .",

    "the presence of bright knots around the radio emission suggests interaction between the radio source and the icm .",
    "this inference of association is strengthened by the observation that the western wing appears to pass through a narrow channel devoid of hard x - ray emission in figure  [ hardness_compare ] .",
    "although higher signal is required to establish their morphology , the data suggest that these knots are part of high - temperature rims bounding the radio source : the hard x - ray emission appears to avoid the radio emission .",

    "when spectra are extracted from these regions , the spectra are fit well by 1-t thermal models with @xmath46  kev . given that we view the cluster in projection and the surrounding material has @xmath1  kev , this is a lower bound on the temperature in the knots . despite the small number of counts , a nonthermal origin for the hard emission is disfavored .",

    "we show the entire chip smoothed by a gaussian kernel with width @xmath54  pixels , but the chip edges enhanced by the unsharp mask are unphysical and should be ignored .",

    "the decrement is in a shallow trough in the exposure map , but the trough spans the length of the chip and our exposure corrected image demonstrates that the decrement described here is substantially deeper than the trough .",
    "we tentatively identify this decrement as a `` cavity '' associated with the eastern wing .",
    "computing the significance of the decrement is not straightforward because of the obvious anisotropy of the cluster emission on scales larger than the chip . subtracting off the @xmath28-model reveals a gradient in the residuals apart from the decrement",
    "there is no obvious way to account for this emission , since increasing the number of _ ad hoc _ model components risks overconstraining the problem .",

    "although it seems clear that radio jets must form bubbles in the icm even when no cavity is detected , the filling factor of older cavities by ambient material is unknown .",
    "assuming cylindrical cavities the volume depends only linearly on the projected length , so we sketch out order - of - magnitude estimates to place limits on the jet power .",
    "the energy required to blow a bubble in the icm is @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the pressure , @xmath95 the volume , and @xmath134 the adiabatic constant for relativistic electrons .",
    "the cavity enthalpy can be expressed as @xmath135 where the gas subscript refers to the icm .",

    "note that @xmath145 is less certain than @xmath146 because of projection effects .",
    "hence , if the wings were formed in the same outburst , the energy is only greater by a factor of @xmath02 .",
    "a plausible range for the jet power can be obtained in view of the putative shock front .",
    "the presence of a shock suggests supersonic expansion , at least in the past  the radio jet is now more akin to that of an fr  i source where subsonic expansion is expected .",
    "the mach  @xmath02 shock implies a source age of less than 75  myr , but since shocks sweep up material and slow down , the initial expansion was likely substantially faster .",
    "the well defined lobes that still give the radio galaxy an edge - brightened morphology suggest that the transition occurred recently , which is consistent with estimates of fr  ii and quasar lifetimes of tens of myr @xcite .",
    "the shock front is also still relatively close to the radio galaxy , so a scenario in which the jets are simply illuminating a very old source is disfavored .",
    "an average jet power of @xmath147  erg  s@xmath6 , corresponding to a lobe age of 32  myr , is consistent with the data . for reference , if ngc  326 had jet power commensurate with cygnus  a ( @xmath148  erg  s@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , its lobes would be inflated in just 0.3  myr !",
    "there is no obvious cocoon and the source lacks hot spots , so this is clearly too high . on the lower end",
    ", transonic lobe expansion gives a jet power of @xmath149  erg  s@xmath6 , which is inconsistent with the shock front .",
    "@xmath147  erg  s@xmath6 is therefore probably accurate to within a factor of @xmath122 , giving an age between 1050  myr .",
    "this power is akin to perseus  a @xcite .",
    "in view of the high resolution x - ray data , we re - examine the formation history of ngc  326 and its long wings .",
    "the salient results of the x - ray analysis follow : ( i ) the very long wings in a relatively cool environment require a single outburst to have an unrealistic age if they expanded transonically or slower .",
    "( ii ) the putative shock and high - temperature rims appear to be causally connected to the radio outburst , but are inconsistent with the present - day jet , which strongly resembles an fr  i source : the jet decelerates and breaks up before reaching the ends of the lobes , and no terminal hot spots are observed .",
    "thus , we do not expect that the strong backflows associated with the hot spots of fr  ii sources are present in ngc  326 .",
    "still , it is notable that the active lobes are well defined and bright , which led to the original classification of the source as an fr  ii .",
    "( iii ) the radio galaxy is situated at the region of brightest x - ray emission in the cluster , but the cluster emission shows structure on scales slightly smaller than the chip .",
    "the wings appear to follow an edge in this emission ( figure  [ rosat ] ) .",
    "the data suggest that the outburst that produced the radio galaxy was much more powerful in the past .",
    "ngc  326 is very weak for an fr  ii source relative to its host galaxy luminosity @xcite ; if the present - day kinetic luminosity of the jet is in equipartition with the radiative luminosity , the jet power is on the order of @xmath150  erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "although equipartition need not be the case , the jet would need to be extremely radiatively inefficient in order to drive the shock and inflate the cavities if it is .",
    "the brightness of the jet near the core suggests this is not the case . if ngc  326 is the result of a powerful outburst that decayed , the shock and well defined lobes are natural consequences of the more powerful stage .    in fact , the parameters of such an outburst fall within the accepted parameters for radio - galaxy power and lifetime as well as the energy required in this system .",
    "suppose that the jet power was initially @xmath151  erg  s@xmath6 , more powerful than perseus  a but less powerful than cygnus  a , and decayed exponentially on an @xmath152-folding time of 10  myr ( thought to be a typical fr  ii lifetime ; * ? ? ?",
    "then the total energy input by the jet into the icm is about @xmath153  erg , of which about two - thirds is injected during the fr  ii phase ( @xmath154  myr ) .",
    "after an e - folding time , the power of this hypothetical jet is only a few times higher than the observed radio power of the core , and the energy injected into the icm is within a factor of 2 of our cavity enthalpy estimate , shock energy and cosmic ray heating notwithstanding .",
    "hence , a fast - rise exponential - decay scenario seems to fit ngc  326 .",
    "we can go a step farther since we know from the synchrotron cooling time that the plasma radiating at 5  ghz in the wings can not be older than about 40  myr , and from spectral aging arguments ( following * ? ? ? * using the spectral data of m01 ) that even the plasma radiating at 1.4  ghz is only about 10  myr old . if this plasma was deposited by flows from the primary lobes to the wings , the wing length of @xmath155100  kpc implies flow speeds of @xmath156  km  s@xmath6 , suggesting strong backflows ( as in w95 ) .",
    "such backflows are associated with the hot spots of fr  ii sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radio galaxy must then have been strong enough to form hot spots no more than a few tens of myr ago .",
    "note that this argument does not rely on a specific mechanism of wing formation as long as the wings are illuminated by active backflows .",
    "such an age is consistent with the location and tentative strength of the shock , which imply an outburst age of ( significantly ) less than 75  myr .",
    "if so , the length of the active lobes implies supersonic expansion , which is what we would expect from a jet driving a shock .",
    "but where did the wings come from ?",
    "there are two general ideas in the literature .",
    "first , it is possible that the wings are radio lobes which happen to grow in a different direction from the jet axis due to anisotropic pressure gradients in the hot atmospheres ( e.g. w95 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other possibility is that the wings represent fossil lobes from a prior outburst in a different direction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as ngc  326 has been used as the poster - child of several ideas presented in the literature , we will evaluate both hydrodynamic and reorientation models .",
    "powerful radio galaxies generate strong backflows at the hot spot zones of the jet head .",
    "these flows are quite rapid ( up to 20% of the jet speed ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) despite the relatively slow advance of the jet head itself .",
    "w95 argue that these flows are buoyant in the icm and , though rapid , may be deflected by a region of higher pressure .",
    "they find that flows of @xmath03000  km  s@xmath6 would be buoyant in the icm of ngc  326 and propose that they formed the wings .",
    "however , it is not likely that wings formed in this way advance at a speed close to the backflow speed .",
    "simulations indicate that lobes are turbulent and that rapid backflows experience shocks within the lobe itself , dissipating bulk kinetic energy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although magnetic fields may collimate flows , mature magnetized lobes still become quite turbulent @xcite . in our recent work specifically investigating the action of pressure gradients on radio lobes in pure hydrodynamic simulations , we found that wings expand at most transonically due to this dissipation of backflow thrust .",
    "hence , the presence of strong backflows does not guarantee rapid wing expansion ( indeed , the internal sound speed of the lobes may be comparable to the backflow speed ) .",
    "in fact , it would be surprising if the simulations showed otherwise , since this would lead to wings significantly wider than the active lobes that also propagate faster than the jet head .",
    "this is a significant problem because the wings in ngc  326 are at least 100  kpc long ; some xrgs have even longer wings and are in cooler atmospheres .",
    "any expansion mechanism that depends on the sound speed requires very old wings .",
    "figure  [ wingages ] shows the ages implied by ( projected ) wing lengths as a function of average expansion velocity for several xrgs with detected igm / icm emission . for reference",
    ", it would take @xmath0200  myr to inflate the wings of ngc  326 transonically and 250  myr to do so buoyantly .",
    "another possibility is that the radio galaxy is born in a dense elliptical environment with the jet aligned with the major axis of the atmosphere .",
    "the cocoon formed by the spent jet material may then become overpressured if the jet advance is stalled by the dense atmosphere , and at some point it will rupture along the minor axis , thereby forming wings @xcite . before pressure equilibrium is established , the outflow will be supersonic ; afterwards , it will be akin to the buoyant backflow scenario .",
    "ngc  326 is not currently overpressured relative to its surroundings ( m01 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so despite the local icm conforming roughly to the geometry required in the @xcite model , expansion would currently be driven by buoyancy and bulk flows .",
    "as described above , this expansion would be subsonic .",
    "the circumstantial evidence therefore favors a reorientation scheme .",
    "detection of a bow shock ahead of the wings would be a strong indictment of the backflow models , but there are insufficient counts in the cxo image to perform an adequate search .",
    "we note that the temperature map in figure  [ tempmap ] reveals bins to the northeast and northwest of the cavity that are @xmath157  times hotter than the surrounding bins , and extraction of ( low signal ) spectra from bins half the size ( @xmath0700  counts ) suggests the icm is indeed hotter closer to the cavity edges .",
    "about four times as many counts are required to determine if this is shock heating .",
    "on the other hand , the problem with reorientation models , as noted by w95 and @xcite , is that the wings have z - shaped morphology and the eastern wing has an off - axis extension to the northwest ( figure  [ radio_maps ] ) . in response to the z - shaped wings",
    ", @xcite proposed a hybrid hydrodynamic and reorientation model in which a stream of ism from a merging galaxy deflects the jet , thereby forming a zrg .",
    "if a smbh binary is formed by this merger , upon coalescence the jet axis will change and the zrg becomes a fossil ; the new lobes give the overall radio emission x - shaped morphology .",
    "this model was proposed for ngc  326 by @xcite and updated for the same by @xcite with the suggestion that a stream of dense gas bent the jets at a radius between 2550  kpc from the core . for reference ,",
    "the projected separation between the nuclei of the dumbbell components in ngc  326 is @xmath06.4  kpc .",
    "a strength of the @xcite model is that it naturally explains the tendency for xrgs to fall near the fr  i / ii break ( with the most recent confirmation in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is because deflecting a jet requires ( from purely hydrodynamic considerations ) the pressure exerted by the jet on the ism to be balanced by the pressure of the gas . for reasonable estimates of the density and bulk motion of streams of merging gas ,",
    "highly relativistic jets can not be stopped .",
    "indeed , the _ non - winged _ fr  ii sources whose jets are deflected by interaction with dense gas also tend to have radio luminosity close to the fr",
    "i / ii divide ( e.g. pks  2153@xmath15869 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or hybrid lobe morphology ( e.g. 3c  321 ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , a jet weak enough to be deflected by the ram pressure of the ism would likely inflate lobes at some fraction or low multiple of the sound speed ( as is thought to be the case with fr  i sources ) .",
    "tying expansion to the sound speed suggests very long radio galaxy lifetimes ( figure  [ wingages ] ) .",
    "apart from fueling the agn steadily , this timescale would require the bending agent to be in contact with the jet at favorable orientations on both sides of the galaxy for up to hundreds of myr . a gas stream 2550  kpc from the agn with bulk motion of @xmath0200  km  s@xmath6 ( comparable to streams in similar systems ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would travel perhaps tens of kpc in this time , meaning the stream must be very long and fortunately oriented in order to keep the jet bent at roughly the same angle at the same radius from the core .",
    "although conceivable , this is a very special circumstance .",
    "another objection in the same vein is that the time between the production of these streams of rotating gas and the coalescence of a smbh binary that engenders the present x - shaped morphology must also be up to hundreds of myr or the wings would not have gotten so long , regardless of the stream geometry .",
    "the time required for a smbh binary to coalesce is unknown , but one might imagine that if the radio galaxy were driven by a component of the smbh binary over 100  myr , accretion from the same disk of gas would cause the spins to become aligned prior to the merger and forestall a spin - flip upon coalescence @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the @xcite model is essentially correct , but it faces two hurdles : there is presently no evidence for the required streams in ngc  326 and the streams , if found , must be able to bend a powerful jet .",
    "it is possible that the z - shaped morphology formed after reorientation .",
    "the buoyant backflow and overpressured cocoon models both take advantage of the anisotropy of the atmosphere to push the radio lobes in the right direction .",
    "this motion would still occur with fossil relics .",
    "suppose that , while active , the lobes of the wings formed an axis across the nucleus , but since the extinction of the jet in that direction evolve buoyantly .",
    "if the major axis of the pocket of icm they inhabit is somewhat off - axis from the major axis of the radio galaxy ( but still close enough to satisfy the * ? ? ?",
    "* correlation ) , buoyancy will tend to lift the wings away from the higher pressure core in opposite directions .",
    "the centers of the wings are about 25  kpc away from a line that would connect them to the nucleus , implying a rise time of less than 50  myr .",
    "this is consistent with the age of the active lobes .",
    "there is evidence that the wings _ do _ respond to the pressures in the icm : both appear to be following a ridge of brighter icm emission ( figure  [ hardness_compare ] ) , forming a large but shallow arc .",
    "assuming the wings were bent into this shape after the jet ceased , the radius of curvature compared to a straight line through the wings suggests buoyancy would produce this morphology within 4070  myr depending on the distance from the core ( this estimate does not take into account spatial variations in the buoyant terminal velocity due to an anisotropic medium ) .",
    "however , the plume to the northwest of the eastern wing ( figure  [ radio_maps ] ) would take longer to rise and is not well explained by this scenario .",
    "in any plausible wing formation scenario , the very long wings of ngc  326 are presently evolving passively in the icm , i.e. , as buoyant structures subject to hydrodynamic forces .",
    "they are therefore akin to `` dead '' radio galaxies @xcite in which the jet has ceased ( in the model of * ? ? ?",
    "* this is precisely what they are ) .",
    "dead radio galaxies are notoriously rare ( for one example , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but crucial to the paradigm of `` radio - mode '' agn feedback .    in radio - mode feedback , radiative cooling in the icm",
    "is regulated by the condensation of gas onto the central galaxy , fueling an agn that drives energetic outflows into the icm , heating it .",
    "x - ray cavities associated with radio lobes provide incontrovertible evidence that these outflows exist , interact with the icm by inflating bubbles of relativistic plasma in it , and deposit sufficient energy to regulate cooling ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is not clear that these outflows _ do _ regulate cooling , since we do not know how this energy is thermalized and isotropized or on what timescales this occurs .",
    "several heating mechanisms have been identified .",
    "these include _ active _ heating through strong or weak shocks ; adiabatic expansion of a jet - blown cavity ; and damped sound waves associated with the cavity inflation , and _ passive _ heating such as entrainment of material in a buoyant plume or infall of displaced gas behind a buoyant bubble ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "although x - ray observations demonstrate that all of these occur , their relative importance ( which may be a function of time , environment , and jet power ) is unknown .",
    "a key problem is that the life cycle of agns ( which itself may be a function of redshift and whether the host galaxy is in a group or a cluster ) is not understood .",
    "for example , an agn with a short duty cycle punctuated by brief , powerful outbursts may be less effective at heating than an agn that more or less continually blows small bubbles (  effervescent  heating ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "dead radio galaxies are therefore of interest , since their frequency is a measure of the agn duty cycle and the rate at which they heat the icm is a measure of the importance of passive heating .",
    "thus , wings may be of interest as probes of feedback .",
    "if xrg wings are dynamically similar to dead radio galaxies , they offer a few additional advantages as laboratories of dead sources .",
    "first , dead radio galaxies are most frequently detected as `` ghost '' cavities unassociated with ghz emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but ghost cavities are typically detected near the group or cluster core where the surface brightness is high .",
    "it can therefore be difficult to distinguish between features associated with old outbursts and the active ones .",
    "wings , on the other hand , can extend more than 100  kpc from the agn and in a very different direction .",
    "second , it is difficult to age ghost cavities , whereas a better understanding of wing formation would yield the ages of both the active lobes and wings in xrgs .",
    "third , winged sources are typically located in group rather than cluster environments . until recently ,",
    "feedback in groups has been largely neglected , but non - gravitational processes are even more important in these systems than in clusters , and the total number of galaxies in groups far outweighs the cluster population .",
    "our examination of the formation history of ngc  326 suggests another advantage to xrg wings : if the reason xrgs are typically found near the fr  i / ii break because they represent decaying outbursts , the total active and passive energy injection rates over the history of the source can be measured in the same system .",
    "the deep x - ray observations required for this kind of measurement only exist in a handful of clusters with both active lobes and ghost cavities ( the most prominent , of course , is perseus ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since groups are much fainter , it is essential to have good targets .",
    "the cxo observation of ngc  326 is not deep enough to carry out heating measurements , but the surface brightness of features detected suggests that an exposure with four times the counts ( twice the signal ) would suffice .",
    "for example , the high - temperature front has about 4,000  counts in its vicinity . to determine if it is a shock and measure its strength to 10% accuracy requires surface brightness values and deprojected temperatures to at least this accuracy in semi - annular bins about 15  arcsec wide at a radius of 50  kpc from the nucleus .",
    "this would require about 15,000  counts per bin .",
    "since strong shocks are much more efficient at irreversibly heating the icm than weak ones , the shock strength is of interest .",
    "likewise , the cavity in the wing would be detected at the @xmath159 level in an exposure of this duration , and cavities associated with the other lobes ( which we assume to be there ) would be easily detected , barring pathological projection effects . in the wing , this quality of detection would place tight constraints on the cavity size , important for determining the cavity stability and placing boundaries from which to measure the amount of entrained material , uplifted material , and temperature or metallicity gradients . an image with twice the signal would allow for adapative binning at scales significantly smaller than the lobe size with temperature measurements accurate to 20% .",
    "specific entropy ( a surer measure of irreversible heating than temperature ) could also be measured on these scales .",
    "metallicity could be determined in slightly larger bins that would still be smaller than the lobe size , enabling a measurement of metallicity gradients around and behind the cavity .",
    "given an accurate measurement of the terminal buoyant velocity of the bubble , the displacement heating rate @xcite could then be measured .",
    "thus , while the extant cxo image lacks the depth to take advantage of the measurements sketched here , it demonstrates that such measurements are well within reach .",
    "the utility of xrg wings depends on high - quality x - ray data and better understanding wing origin , so flux estimates in other systems are important .",
    "only 13  xrgs have cxo or xmm-_newton _ data , and only @xmath08 of these have significant igm / icm emission ( model flux estimates provided in * ? ? ?",
    "only two of these have moderately deep exposures ( ngc  326 and 4c  + 00.58 ) .",
    "the cxo image presented here suggests that for larger xrgs , the higher effective area of _ xmm - newton _ makes it a better instrument for these types of measurements .",
    "we report on a 100  ks cxo image of ngc  326 , an xrg with wings 100  kpc long that resides in a poor cluster . owing to its dramatic wings ,",
    "ngc  326 has frequently been the subject of studies attempting to explain wing origin ( w95 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cxo image provides an important step forward in evaluating these hypotheses due to the identification of several x - ray features associated with the radio galaxy .",
    "these include a high - temperature front to the southeast of the radio galaxy ( figure  [ tempmap ] ) , which we assume to be a shock front , high - temperature knots of emission around the radio galaxy akin to cavity rims ( figure  [ hardness_compare ] ) , and a cavity associated with the eastern wing ( figure  [ cavity ] ) .",
    "the high angular resolution of cxo compared to rosat also allows us to remove point sources and characterize the broader icm , revealing an x - ray peak associated with the northern lobe of the radio galaxy rather than the ism and an elliptical enhancement around the radio galaxy ( first identified in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    by characterizing the immediate environment of the radio galaxy and taking into account spectral aging of the radio emission in the wings",
    ", we can construct a reasonable history for the agn outbursts .",
    "the jets , lack of hot spots , and low radio power ( @xmath160  erg  s@xmath6 ) indicate a weak fr  i - like source today , but the putative shock front , lobe size and morphology , and ghz emission at the wing tips indicate a powerful fr  ii source no more than @xmath030  myr ago .",
    "we therefore suggest the kinetic jet power could be described as @xmath161  erg  s@xmath6 , where @xmath162  myr for the current outburst .",
    "this function would account for the observed features as well as produce about the right amount of cavity enthalpy .",
    "the energy required to inflate cavities the size of the lobes places the current kinetic jet power between @xmath163  erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "the radio power suggests that the flow is therefore still radiatively inefficient .",
    "ngc  326 is the best studied xrg , and the variety of wing formation models associated with it is a testament to the difficulty of proving any one scenario .",
    "the sound speed in the icm is only 500  km  s@xmath6 ( @xmath164  kpc  myr@xmath6 ) , implying that the long ( 100  kpc ) wings must have expanded supersonically .",
    "this disfavors the backflow models , which have yet to convincingly demonstrate that internal lobe flows can generate sustained supersonic expansion ; simulations indicate that they become turbulent and dissipate their thrust before reaching the wing edges .",
    "in fact , any model in which the wing growth is related to the sound speed is disfavored in systems with long wings ( figure  [ wingages ] ) .",
    "the most likely alternative is that the wings are fossil relics illuminated by the present outburst , but @xcite note that a simple spin - flip would not explain the z - shaped morphology of the wings .",
    "however , their model relies on bending a moderately weak jet , which would not be expected to propel hypersonic lobes . as",
    "fossil radio lobes would be subject to hydrodynamic forces , it is possible that the z - shaped morphology of the wings is produced by buoyant evolution in an anisotropic atmosphere .",
    "it would take less than 50  myr for the wings to rise buoyantly away from an axis connecting them through the nucleus to their present - day location , which is consistent with the age of the active lobes and the age required for the wings to respond to the anisotropy of the large - scale cluster emission to form the understated c - shaped arc ( figure  [ hardness_compare ] ) .",
    "however , this scenario fails to explain the plume on the eastern wing .",
    "it is also notable that the tendency for xrgs to have jets co - aligned with the major axes of their host galaxies @xcite and hot atmospheres @xcite extends to xrgs with very long wings .",
    "this is unexplained by any reorientation model , and remains compelling evidence that the environments of most xrgs help determine their morphology .",
    "xrgs provide an important target for characterizing agn feedback through the study of `` ghost '' cavities , both as pathfinders ( they illuminate the cavities in the ghz bands ) as well as targets which are readily distinguished from the active outburst .",
    "the heating rate associated with dead outbursts can then be measured in isolation , and compared to the timescales required to thermalize and isotropize the energy in the icm . in cases such as ngc  326 , where we believe most of the energy associated with the active outburst has already been deposited , we can use the agn lifetime to estimate an average heating rate , assuming some duty cycle .",
    "xrgs are therefore interesting beyond the origin of their bizarre morphology ."
