    "currently , there are three neutrino anomalies interpreted as evidence for neutrino oscillations , namely the atmospheric @xcite , the solar @xcite and the lsnd @xcite anomaly with three distinct squared neutrino mass differences .",
    "however , oscillations between the three standard model ( sm ) neutrinos are described by only two independent neutrino mass  squared differences , allowing only two of the above anomalies as being due to oscillations in a sm scenario extended by massive neutrinos . before enlarging the neutrino sector by some additional , unknown _ sterile _ neutrinos , each of the experimental results has to be checked independently .    over the last years , the controversial results of the two experiments lsnd ( liquid scintillator neutrino detector at lansce , los alamos , usa ) and karmen ( karlsruhe rutherford medium energy neutrino experiment at isis , rutherford , uk ) both searching for neutrino oscillations  in a _ short baseline _ regime , have led to intense discussions .",
    "the two experiments are similar as they use  beams from the -  decay at rest ( dar ) chain  followed by  with energies up to 52mev .",
    "furthermore , both experiments are looking for  from  oscillations according to the two  flavor oscillation probability @xmath1 with the difference of the squared masses  in , the flight length of the neutrino @xmath2 in meters and the neutrino energy @xmath3 in units of mev .",
    "the detection reaction  provides a spatially correlated delayed coincidence signature of a prompt  and a subsequent neutron capture signal .",
    "this paper describes a combined statistical analysis of the final lsnd and karmen2 results .",
    "there are significant changes to the treatment of lsnd data in the final lsnd paper @xcite .",
    "the present paper uses only the decay - at - rest ( dar )  data , and leaves out the impact of the decay - in - flight ( dif )  data .",
    "as shown later , the lsnd data has a favored region in the 7  region of  as a consequence of this change .",
    "this is in contrast to the lsnd result @xcite which disfavors this solution at  because of the inclusion of the dif flux .",
    "a motivation for this change is that a direct comparison of the two experiments is less model dependent if one considers the lsnd dar flux only , since karmen does not have a dif neutrino flux present in its source .",
    "the analysis is based on a frequentist approach following the suggestions of @xcite . for both experiments ,",
    "the data are analysed with a maximum likelihood analysis followed by the extraction of confidence levels in a unfied approach .",
    "it is not the task nor the purpose of this analysis to treat the apparent disagreement between the two experiments .",
    "rather , assuming no serious systematical error in either experiment or their interpretation with respect to  oscillation , we apply a consistent statistical analysis to quantitatively establish their level of compatibility .",
    "the work follows an earlier analysis @xcite based on intermediate data sets .",
    "there are two separate questions investigated in this paper that relate to the lsnd and karmen data .",
    "the first question is : at what level are the two data sets _ compatible _ with each other ? this question addresses whether or not the two experiments force one to draw opposite conclusions from their respective data .",
    "if one _ assumes _ that the data sets are compatible , the second question becomes : what are the most likely regions for the oscillation parameters ?",
    "this method is somewhat analogous to treating the karmen data as coming from a near detector at 17 meters , and treating the lsnd data as coming from a far detector at 30 meters .",
    "it ignores the question of systematic differences between the experiments , such as whether or not , for example , an unaccounted source of  background neutrinos was present in the lsnd data and not present in the karmen data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after a short overview of the experimental setups of both experiments , section  [ sec : lhd - ana ] describes the data analyses leading to likelihood functions of the oscillation parameters .",
    "section  [ sec : ind - conf ] is devoted to the extraction of confidence regions for the individual experiments . in section  [ sec : comp",
    "] , the experimental results are combined statistically , extracting levels of compatibility as well as oscillation parameters compatible with both experiments .",
    "we conclude with implications of this joint analysis , a comparison with other oscillation searches and an outlook to upcoming experimental tests of the favored oscillation parameters presented in this analysis .",
    "the source of neutrinos for the lsnd experiment was the interaction of the 798mev proton beam at the los alamos neutron science center ( lansce ) , in which a large number of pions , mostly @xmath4 are produced .",
    "the @xmath5 are mainly absorbed and only a small fraction decay to @xmath6 , which in turn are largely captured .",
    "thus , the resulting neutrino source is dominantly due to  and   decays , most of which decay at rest ( dar ) . with a very small contamination of @xmath7 , a measurement of the reaction  provides a sensitive way to search for  oscillations .",
    "such events are identified by detection of both the @xmath8 and the 2.2 mev @xmath9 from the reaction .",
    "in addition , the @xmath10 flux from @xmath4 and @xmath11 decay - in - flight ( dif ) is very small , which allows a search for  oscillations via the measurement of electrons above the michel electron endpoint from the reaction .",
    "the lsnd experiment took data over six calendar years ( 1993 - 1998 ) . during this period the lansce accelerator operated for 17 months , delivering 28896c of protons on the production target .",
    "the lsnd detector @xcite consisted of an approximately cylindrical tank 8.3 m long by 5.7 m in diameter .",
    "the center of the detector was located 30 m from the beam stop neutrino source .",
    "the tank was filled with liquid scintillator consisting of mineral oil and 0.031 g / l of b - pbd .",
    "this low scintillator concentration allowed the detection of both  light and scintillation light .",
    "photomultiplier time and pulse - height signals were used to reconstruct the track with an average rms position resolution of @xmath12 cm and an energy resolution of @xmath13% at the michel endpoint of 52.8mev .",
    "the karmen experiment used as neutrino source the pulsed spallation neutron source isis of the rutherford appleton laboratory delivering 800mev protons . in contrast to the lansce source , the protons are extracted from the synchrotron as an intense but narrow double pulse , consisting of two parabolic pulses with a width of 100ns separated by a peak - to - peak gap of 325ns .",
    "the unique time structure of the isis proton pulses allowed a clear separation of neutrino - induced events from any beam unrelated background .",
    "the intrinsic contamination of the isis beam is @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the karmen detector @xcite was a rectangular high resolution liquid scintillation calorimeter , located at a mean distance of 17.7 m from the isis target at an angle of 100 degrees relative to the proton beam .",
    "the liquid scintillator was enclosed by a multilayer active veto system and a 7000 t steel shielding .",
    "the 65m@xmath15 of liquid scintillator consisted of a mixture of paraffin oil ( @xmath16vol . ) , pseudocumene ( @xmath17vol . ) and",
    "2g / l scintillating additive 1-phenyl-3-mesityl-2-pyrazoline .",
    "the liquid scintillator volume was optically separated into 512 independent central modules .",
    "gadolinium was implemented between the module walls for an efficient detection of thermal neutrons  with on average 3 @xmath9 s of energy @xmath18mev .",
    "the karmen detector as liquid scintillator calorimeter was optimized for high energy resolution of @xmath19 .",
    "each event had energy , time and position information , as well as the number of addressed modules and their relative time differences .",
    "the karmen2 experiment took data from february 1997 to march 2001 . during this time , protons equivalent to a total charge of 9425 coulombs have been accumulated on the isis target .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath20  from the isis beam stop target .",
    "for both experiments , a  signal from  oscillations consists of a spatially correlated delayed ( , n ) sequence from . due to the different experimental techniques , the parameters to identify such sequences vary .",
    "details of the lsnd event reconstruction can be found in @xcite and @xcite , the requirements for event sequences in karmen are described in @xcite .    in lsnd , a ( , n ) sequence requires a prompt electron - like event with energy @xmath21mev followed by a low energy @xmath9event .",
    "the information about the delayed event is characterized via a likelihood ratio @xmath22 : if within one millisecond after the initial event another event is recorded at distance @xmath23 cm , the likelihood ratio @xmath22 in energy ( pmt hits ) , time and distance of being a correlated  over an accidental coincidence is calculated , otherwise @xmath24 .",
    "requiring a high likelihood ratio @xmath22 selects ( , n ) correlated events with low uncorrelated background , the so - called `` gold - plated '' events .",
    "however , to determine the oscillation parameters  and  in a likelihood analysis , an event sample with a much looser cut in @xmath22 is used , leading to higher efficiency for the oscillation channel , but naturally increasing the background . for the lsnd sample analysed here ,",
    "all the cuts described in @xcite have been applied with two exceptions : the energy of the prompt event has been restricted to @xmath25mev instead of @xmath26mev and we applied a loose cut of @xmath27 instead of no @xmath22-cut at all .",
    "the reason for these changes is twofold .",
    "first , the upper energy cut @xmath28mev excludes any significant influence of the  channel on the much more sensitive  channel . for any value of the oscillation parameter ,",
    "the expected contribution from  remains below 2% of the  signal .",
    "the second reason is a more technical one .",
    "applying a unified frequentist approach to the likelihood function gained from the reduced data implies simulation and analysis of a large number of event samples analog to the experiment .",
    "therefore , one is interested not to have too large samples containing mainly background events . with the cuts above ,",
    "the original event sample is reduced by a factor of 5.5 to 1032 candidates , with an efficiency for  at high  reduced to 64.4% of the original one ( only 3.2% of the expected  events remain ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_lsndevents ] shows the event sample comprising 1032 beam - on events .",
    "four variables are used to categorize the events :        the energy of the primary electron @xmath29 , its spatial distribution along the detector axis @xmath30 along the detector axis can be easily referred to the neutrino flight path @xmath2 by adding the distance source  center of detector tank . ] and the angle @xmath31 between the direction of the incident neutrino and the reconstructed electron path .",
    "the fourth variable is the likelihood ratio @xmath32 for a ( , n ) coincidence .",
    "the binning of this distribution with the upper edge of bin number @xmath33 representing a value @xmath34 has been chosen for practical reasons .",
    "note that the spectra in figure  [ fig_lsndevents ] are projections of a 4-dim space of correlated parameters for each event .",
    "superimposed to the data are shown the beam - unrelated and beam - related background contributions amounting to a total number of @xmath35 events .",
    "the expected background contributions are broken down in table  [ tab : tb1 ] , for further details we refer to @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     therefore , we restricted the hypotheses tested from a fine grid for karmen2 to some grid points representing the typical variation of expected oscillation events . for a fixed oscillation parameter @xmath36",
    ", 4 oscillation scenarios were simulated with 1000 individual samples each ( see table  [ tab : lsndgrid ] ) .    as verified by earlier calculations @xcite and the karmen2 analysis , the main variation of @xmath37 for a given confidence @xmath38 in the parameter space ( , ) follows the variation of the signal strength , i.e. the number of oscillation events @xmath39 among the event sample .",
    "we therefore extrapolated the values of @xmath40 in table  [ tab : lsndgrid ] linearly with @xmath39 and adopted , at each grid point ( , ) with its expected number of oscillation events @xmath39 , the estimator value @xmath41 .",
    "having constructed the estimator cut distribution this way , the last step is analogous to that used for karmen2 , i.e. to cut the lsnd likelihood function with the given values @xmath41 below the maximum and draw the contour lines .",
    "figure  [ fig_lsndosciplot ] shows the contour lines of areas containing 68% , 90% and 95% confidence .",
    "although parameter combinations with @xmath42  are part of the area , they are scarcely included in the more stringent interval of 68% confidence , demonstrating the lower likelihood values for such oscillation scenarios .",
    "it is useful to compare the extracted confidence regions with the favored regions given in @xcite where the likelihood function had been calculated based on a larger event sample ( 5697 events with @xmath26mev and no @xmath22cut ) .",
    "in addition , a simplified extraction of confidence regions according to equation  ( [ eq : gauss ] ) had been applied .    , from @xcite ]",
    "figure  [ fig_lsndnewandold ] shows , that for lower values of , there is only a slight shift to larger oscillation amplitudes of the new analysis .",
    "a large overlap of the  area with the region according to @xmath43 demonstrates the good statistical agreement of the analyses of both event samples . for higher values of , the differences are more pronounced .",
    "compared to the older analysis , the confidence region is not only shifted considerably to larger amplitudes , but the likelihood values themselves are larger relative to the likelihood maximum which results in a larger area of .",
    "these effects can be understood by the upper energy cut @xmath28mev applied in the actual analysis . restricting the analysis mainly to the oscillation channel  favors also large values of whereas a signal from , derived in @xcite to be much smaller , but detectable mainly at higher energies , decreases the likelihood for such solutions as well as the absolute strength or oscillation amplitude .",
    "finally , we note the importance to derive values of @xmath40 leading to correct coverage of confidence regions .",
    "these values differ considerably from the simplified gaussian approach of a constant of 2.3 units . in an earlier analysis of the lsnd data @xcite ,",
    "the typical estimator cut values were @xmath44 on the basis of about 3000 events .",
    "now , with even smaller event samples , the values of @xmath40 further increase to @xmath45 .",
    "this dependance of @xmath40 is also underlined by the typical values for the much smaller karmen2 sample size , where @xmath46 ranges from 3 to 5 .",
    "having analysed both experiments likelihood functions with the same consistent method , we can now use this method and its results to deduce quantitative statements on the question of statistical compatibility of both experimental results and , in the case of such compatibility , on the common parameter combinations ( , ) .",
    "one of the most misleading but nevertheless very frequently used interpretation of the lsnd and karmen results is to take the lsnd region left over from the karmen exclusion curve as area of ( , ) favored by both experiments .",
    "such an interpretation , though appealingly straight forward , completely ignores the information of both likelihood functions and reduces them to two discrete levels of a specific confidence @xmath38 . to be able to correctly combine the two experimental results and extract the combined confidence regions",
    ", we have to use the original estimator distributions for karmen and for lsnd . in a first step , the level of statistical compatibility of the two experimental outcomes has to be quantified . in the second step , the parameters favored by both experiments will be deduced .    in the following analysis , an _ experiment _ or _ event _",
    ", in logical terms of frequency or probability of occurence , means repeating both , the karmen _ and _ the lsnd experiment .",
    "compatibility is then achieved if there are at least some oscillation parameters being the element of both the repeated karmen - like and lsnd - like experiment s confidence region .",
    "we make the well justified assumption that the two experiments lsnd and karmen are independent .",
    "then , a two dimensional estimator distribution can be constructed for each hypothesis @xmath47 from the individual distributions @xmath48 of karmen and @xmath49 of lsnd by an inverse projection . for each hypothesis ,",
    "the pair of experimental values @xmath50 is checked to be part of the inner @xmath38% of the simulated 2dimensional estimator distribution .",
    "there are different methods of ordering these 2dimensional distributions all leading to very similar results @xcite . in the following , we require each experimental value @xmath51 and @xmath52 to be contained in the corresponding 1dimensional interval of confidence .",
    "this selection criterion is equivalent to selecting a rectangle of frequency of the 2dim estimator distribution .",
    "the resulting confidence is @xmath53 .",
    "since we do not weight the experiments , we define @xmath54 , so that for a combined confidence of e.g. 81% , we demand @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    at a level of @xmath57 , no parameter combination ( , ) fulfills the requirement @xmath58 any more .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that , at the level of combined confidence @xmath59 the two experiments are completely incompatible . coming back to our definition of probability of occurence , in 64% of repetitions of double experiments , a karmen2 plus an lsnd experiment with their typical parameters and statistics , the outcome would consist of statistically compatible results with a specified set of oscillation parameters ( , ) .      in the following , we analyse the preferred regions of oscillation parameters in the case of compatibility defined in the section before . if two experiments are independent producing two likelihood functions as result of the event analysis , the recipe for a combined analysis is straight forward .",
    "the likelihoods can be multiplied , i.e. in our case the logarithms of the likelihood functions are added .",
    "the absolute values of the likelihood functions are somewhat arbitrary .",
    "a recommended presentation of   is to normalize the individual functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 to a point in ( , ) where they are equally sensitive to a potential signal @xcite . in our case of the oscillation search",
    "this corresponds to values of @xmath62 .",
    "therefore we define the combined likelihood function    @xmath63        figure  [ kl_lhdfunction ] shows the combined function @xmath64 with a maximum of on a long flat ridge of low  values .",
    "the positive signal of lsnd dominates the combined likelihood .",
    "however , the maximum in comparison to the no  oscillation value is reduced ( see equ .  [ lsnd_max ] ) as well as the shape at higher values of   is significantly modified due to the karmen2 likelihood function .    to determine the confidence regions in ( , ) , again we apply the unified approach , i.e. we create the estimator distribution @xmath65 for various hypotheses ( , ) @xmath66 and compare the experiment s value @xmath67 with the cut value @xmath68 for a given confidence . to get the estimator ,",
    "a simulated event sample now consists of a karmen2-like and an lsnd - like mc sample each analysed with the appropriate likelihood definitions",
    ". then both likelihood functions are added following equation  ( [ kl_lhd ] ) and the estimator @xmath69 is calculated .",
    "the typical cut values for a confidence of @xmath70% are slightly higher than the individual lsnd ones , ranging from 3.5 to 5.5 .",
    "figure  [ fig_combosciplot ] shows the confidence regions of the oscillation parameters for the combined likelihood analysis .",
    "the total confidence of a parameter region is hereby reduced by the fraction of incompatibility of the two experiments , so @xmath71 which results in e.g. @xmath72% total confidence for the parameter combinations within the area denoted as  area in figure  [ fig_combosciplot ] .",
    "the combination of both experiments results with this consistent frequentist approach demonstrates that  solutions with @xmath73  are excluded .",
    "there remain essentially two solutions in the parameter space of oscillations , one at @xmath74  and the area with @xmath75 .",
    "the latter one , though graphically rather large in figure  [ fig_combosciplot ] corresponds to just one solution in the phase space of oscillations : any  signal from oscillation has rather low energy , the evolution of the oscillation probability ( equ.[eq : osci ] ) being just at the beginning of the oscillation length . with an oscillation parameter @xmath76 , and a typical lower energy of @xmath77mev from  decay at rest",
    ", the first maximum of oscillations of  into  would be at a distance @xmath78 from the neutrino source .",
    "for such oscillation parameters , the negative result of karmen2 compared to the excess of lsnd mainly reflects the different detector distances @xmath79 m versus @xmath80 m from the source .",
    "this is one way to reconcile the results of the two experiments .    to summarize , at a joint confidence level of @xmath81% , the two experiments are either incompatible or lead to just one single oscillation solution at @xmath75 .",
    "the remaining 20% confidence separate into an enlargement of the parameter region of low  values and into a second oscillation solution at @xmath74 .",
    "we have analysed both the karmen2 and the lsnd final data with a maximum likelihood method using a similar event  based likelihood function .",
    "the likelihood functions as functions of the free parameters  and  demonstrate the different outcomes of the experiments , namely a clear , statistically significant excess of  in lsnd versus no indication of an oscillation signal in karmen2 . to deduce regions of correct coverage",
    ", we applied a unified frequentist approach to both likelihood analyses individually .",
    "the results underline the feasibility of as well as the necessity for such an approach .",
    "a quantitative joint statistical analysis has been performed leading to a level of 36% incompatibility of the experimental outcomes , corresponding to individual confidence levels of 60% . for the cases of statistical compatibility",
    ", the common parameter regions have been identified on the basis of the unified frequentist approach applied to the combined likelihood function of karmen2 and lsnd .",
    "the derived confidence regions in ( , ) clearly differ from an often applied but incorrect graphical overlap of the confidence regions of the individual experiments .",
    "there are two oscillation scenarios with either @xmath74  or @xmath75compatible with both experiments .",
    "we performed a joint statistical analysis incorporating some of the systematic uncertainties of the experiments , such as neutrino flux uncertainty , accuracy of known cross sections and resolution functions of both experiments .",
    "further unknown systematic uncertainties might become evident only by performing new experiments to confirm or discard the results described here .",
    "figure  [ fig_allosciplot ] shows the intended sensitivity of a new experiment , miniboone at fermilab @xcite , which is under construction and will independently crosscheck the lsnd evidence .",
    "in addition , we did not incorporate the results of other experiments on the oscillation parameters investigated . as shown in figure  [ fig_allosciplot ] , the deduced favored region in ( , ) is partly overlaped by  exclusion curves of other experiments . in particular , the recent nomad  result @xcite clearly reduces the overall likelihood for the @xmath74  solution .",
    "a complete analysis should include these results on the basis of the same statistical method , i.e. a consistent frequentist analysis .",
    "this implies , however , the detailed knowledge of experimental data and resolution functions of these experiments not accessible to us .",
    "furthermore , the exclusion curve from the bugey experiment is based on the disappearance search . combining this experiment correctly with",
    "the appearance results of  or   in terms of mixing angles would therefore also require a full three or four  dimensional mixing scheme with theoretical models including sterile neutrinos @xcite or cpt violation @xcite and would become model - dependent .",
    "we would like to thank the members of both collaborations for the encouragement and help to make this final joint analysis possible .",
    "in particular , we acknowledge the support of and many discussions with w.c .",
    "louis concerning the lsnd as well as g. drexlin concerning the karmen experiment . without the openness and trust",
    "to analyse both data sets in detail , such an analysis would nt have been feasible . k.e . also wants to thank the alexander von humboldt foundation for financial support during visits to the los alamos national laboratory . clarifying discussions with kai zuber on the principles of combining experiments with contradictory central statements",
