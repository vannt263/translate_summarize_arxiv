    "a mathematical definition will be given below .",
    "under this dynamics the order is preserved , @xmath7 for all times @xmath8 . in previous work",
    "we investigate the case of initial conditions with equal spacing , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "another natural initial condition is such to have the process space - time stationary , which is accomplished by assuming that @xmath10 is a poisson point process with uniform intensity which , without loss of generality , can be taken as @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath12 is again an intensity 1 poisson point process .",
    "our interest are the fluctuations of @xmath13 for large @xmath3 and @xmath2 . to understand their properties one first has to find out how an initially small perturbation close to the origin propagates in time .",
    "this path is known as characteristic . in our model , because of the one - sided collisions , the characteristic turns out to be a straight line with velocity 1 .",
    "if @xmath14 , @xmath15 denoting integer part , then for @xmath16 only the randomness of the initial conditions plays a role and the fluctuations of @xmath13 will be gaussian asymptotically on the @xmath17 scale .",
    "however close to the characteristic , i.e. , @xmath18 with @xmath19 , one observes non - gaussian fluctuations in the @xmath20 scale , the properties of which will be analysed in great detail in this contribution . with our methods we can handle the stochastic process in @xmath21 at fixed @xmath3 .",
    "two - time properties along the characteristic are known to be difficult .",
    "for example , a long - standing problem is to obtain the joint distribution of @xmath22 for large @xmath3 . at the time of writing johansson reports on asymptotic results for the model studied in this paper @xcite .",
    "our results are closely linked to the one - dimensional kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation @xcite with stationary initial data .",
    "kpz is a stochastic pde for a height function @xmath23 and reads @xmath24 with @xmath25 space - time white noise . as written the equation is only formal , but a precise mathematical meaning has been given @xcite .",
    "as random initial data @xmath26 we choose the statistics of two - sided brownian motion with constant drift @xmath27 .",
    "the dynamics is stationary in the sense that @xmath28 is again two - sided brownian motion with drift @xmath27 @xcite .",

    "@xcite succeeded in writing down reasonably concise formulas for the distribution of @xmath29 , confirming the prior replica computation @xcite . through an intricate asymptotic analysis",
    "they establish ( theorem 2.17 of  @xcite ) that in distribution , for fixed @xmath21 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the airy process corresponding to stationary initial data . in spirit one should think of @xmath13 as @xmath29 with @xmath32 being a continuum version of the discrete particle label @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , as one of our results we will establish in theorem  [ thmasymp0 ] that @xmath33 which is the immediate analogue of .",
    "in fact , convergence is proved in the sense of finite - dimensional distribution , not only for the one - point distribution .",
    "similar results have been obtained earlier for the stationary png model @xcite and for the stationary tasep @xcite . for the latter ,",
    "the full stochastic process in @xmath21 has been worked out @xcite .",
    "the expression we obtain for the joint distributions of @xmath31 , see definition  [ defastat ] , is new and differs from the one in @xcite .    for several reasons we believe that it is of interest to add a third model to the list of kpz type models with stationary initial conditions",
    "obviously , the universality hypothesis is further strengthened .",
    "more importantly our model provides a bridge to diffusion processes with one - sided interaction as discussed in @xcite . besides we also have to develop a method different from the previous ones . as in the case of png and tasep",
    ", one can not study the stationary initial conditions directly .",
    "one has to start from a step , in our case meaning that to the right of @xmath34 the poisson point process has density @xmath11 , while to the left it has density @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "surprisingly , as for png and tasep , by a burke type theorem the left - half system can be replaced by a boundary condition for @xmath37 and , in fact , only the right - half system with labels @xmath38 has to be considered . for png and tasep the limit",
    "@xmath39 has been accomplished for fixed @xmath3 , while here we first take the limit @xmath0 at step size @xmath40 .",
    "this leads us to a novel transition process , see theorem  [ thmasymp ] . the stationary case , @xmath41 ,",
