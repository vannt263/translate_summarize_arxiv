    "figure  [ cartoon ] shows a schematic cross section of a mature hiv virus .",
    "maturation of an hiv virus starts from an immature spherical shell of about @xmath0 gag  polyproteins \" that envelops both the genome molecules as well certain enzymes .",

    "other fragments of the gag polyprotein (  ca \" fragments ) form the inner capsid while the remainder of the gag protein become part of the outer shell of the mature virus ( see fig  [ cartoon ] ) . upon infection , this outer shell fuses with the membrane of the infected cell and the mature conical capsid containing the viral rna gets released into the host cytoplasm .",

    "first , the genome of retroviruses is composed of two single stranded ( ss ) rna molecules , each of about @xmath1 bases ( 10 kilobase or kb ) .",
    "single stranded viral rna molecules of 2 kb form branched structures in solution stabilized by short , complementary - paired sequences .",
    "the typical size of these structures is about 50 nm @xcite and a 10 kb genome would be expected to be about twice larger . of monomers as @xmath2 . ]",
    "the hiv rna genome molecules are confined inside the conical capsid that has a maximum diameter in the range of 50 nm @xcite and a length in the range of 100 nm .",
    "the confinement free energy cost of a 10 kb rna molecule inside such a capsid would be estimated to be quite small . actually , the size of the ss rna genome molecules of hiv and other retroviruses is reduced further because they are _ condensed _ by the ncp7 fragments .",
    "the rna genome molecules of hiv are believed to occupy only about 20 % of the average volume of a mature hiv capsid .",
    "confinement free energies would thus be expected to be insignificant for hiv .",
    "in this paper we propose that confinement forces _ do _ play an important role in the hiv life cycle .",
    "the conical hiv capsid contains a copy of the protein _ reverse transcriptase _ ( rt ) .",
    "the rt enzyme converts ss rna molecules into ds dna molecules . until recently it was commonly accepted that reverse transcription ( rtion ) in retroviruses , including hiv , takes place within the cytoplasm of the infected cell after the uncoating of the mature capsid @xcite .",
    "recent studies argue that the inner capsid appears to remain intact during most of the rtion , and that rtion stalling significantly slows down uncoating @xcite .",
    "it indeed would seem clear that the rtion process should be much more efficient if it took place inside a small  reaction vessel \" where the concentration of reactants and enzymes would be much higher than in the cytoplasm of the host cell .",
    "this suggests that rtion leads to uncoating .",
    "the transformation of an ss rna genome molecule into a ds dna molecule indeed transforms the very flexible annealed branched secondary structure of ss rna into a linear b - dna polymer with a substantial bending stiffness ( the persistence length of b - dna is in the range of 50 nm ) .",
    "if the hiv capsid is sufficiently fragile , then the increased dna confinement energy could potentially lead to uncoating .",
    "the forces would of course be much weaker than for the case of phages , which means that retroviral capsids should be extremely fragile .",
    "however , the ncp7 fragments are likely to be condensing agents for ds dna genome molecules as well .",
    "it is known that the presence of millimolar concentrations of condensing agents induces long b - dna molecules to spontaneously condense into tightly wound toroids with a diameter in the 100 nm range @xcite . in fact , provided the mature capsid is intact during the rtion , the nc concentration inside the capsid is in the millimolar range , and should be sufficient to completely condense the dsdna genome .",
    "this evidently would weaken the confinement forces exerted by the dna .",
    "if the strength of the condensing agents is properly matched with the fracture strength of the capsid then this could produce uncoating - during rtion - for a reasonably well - defined b - dna length .",
    "increasing the strength of the condensing agents could shrink the dna to the extent that there is no uncoating while decreasing the strength could produce premature uncoating .",
    "recent findings showing that there is an optimum stability for the mature hiv capsid that is critical for viral infectivity @xcite would be in support of such a proposal .",
    "physical descriptions that were developed to describe the very large dna confinement forces inside phages @xcite can not be directly applied to the case of retroviruses .",
    "it is the aim of this article to provide a physical description of the uncoating of retroviruses by rtion , using only basic soft matter physics , and to find the proper matching condition between the strength of dsdna condensing agents and the fracture strength of the capsid . in the next two sections we first provide simple descriptions of the mechanical properties of dna toroids and of viral shells . in the last section we construct an  uncoating diagram \" that could be used to interpret experiments on hiv capsid uncoating .",

    "the two vertical arrows are examples of two systems with the same value of @xmath92 but different fracture stresses ( marked + and - ) .",
    "the + case would be an example of a capsid that is so robust that it can not be uncoated by rtion of hiv genome while the - case is an example of a capsid that is sufficiently fragile so it can be uncoated by rtion beyond a critical volume fraction marked by the red dot .",

    "the two conditions on the fracture stress and the strength of the selff - attraction ( eqs .",
    "[ con1 ] and  [ con2 ] ) are our main results .",
    "how do they apply to hiv ? .",
    "according to eq.[con1 ] , the dimensionless stress @xmath142 at uncoating should be less than @xmath97 times a number of the order of one . if the materials properties of hiv capsids - in terms of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath86 - would be similar to those of the capsids of small rna viruses ( such as ccmv )",

    ", we find that @xmath17 must be less than @xmath145 .",
    "the dna toroid is necessarily skinny before and at uncoating . in other words , for the proviral dsdna to uncoat the capsid at such low volume occupancy , the toroidal globule should have a large internal whole , and an external diameter larger then the one of the capsid .",
    "the later is only possible if the dna self - attraction is sufficiently weak , such that the dna toroid is only loosely wound .",
    "the uncoating line eq  [ un ] must run well to the left of the red curve .",
    "it follows that @xmath146 should be significantly below one .",
    "also , it follows that the mature hiv capsid should be rather fragile , such that the product of its rigidity and critical strain b*ec are less then fihiv  0.4 .",
    "if the critical strain ec of the hiv capsid ( still to be measured ) is close to one , i.e. the mature hiv capsid is as elastic as typical shells of the small plant viruses , it implies that its rigidity parameter b should be < fihiv  0.4",
    ". the later can be expliciity related to the bending and stretching capsid rigidities ( still to be measured ) , and further related to the strength of protein - protein interactions that form the capsid . mutations of the capsid proteins leading to the stronger or weaker capsids were both shown to be detrimental to the hiv live cycle ( aiken ) , consistent with our prediction that the more stable capsid will never get uncoated by rtion , while the weaker capsid will uncoat pre - maturely before the rtion transition completion , thereby leading to the loss of essential proteins and rtion termination.it follows that the capsid should be fragile . in summary",
    ", it follows from our theory that the uncoating of hiv by rtion requires fragile capsids , relatively weak condensing agents , and skinny dna toroids . for the capsid elasticity constant",
    "kc this implies that it should be @xmath147 , i.e. about 100-fold less than the elasticity of the small plant viruses measured by micromanipulation .",
    "while the elasticity of mature hiv capsid was not yet measured , this prediction is consistent with the very low capsid stability , that had so far precluded its biochemical purification and its mechanical studies .",
    "just as the capsid stability should be low and tuned for uncoating by rtion , the strength of nc - induced dna self - attraction appears to be also optimized for that cause .",
    "the 0.15 kbt of attractive free energy per bp estimated above is a reasonable value , when compared to the analogous    the estimated maximum value for the cohesion energy is a reasonable value for the nc - induced dna self - attraction free energy , based on analogous values for the dna self - attraction with simple non - biological cations such as cohex@xmath148 or spd@xmath148 , that have an effective charge similar to that of hiv nc ( about 3.5 + ) @xcite .",
    "consistent with these ideas , there is evidence that mutations in ncp7 that reduce its condensation ability ( e.g. , by reducing the positive charge ) lead to the major rtion defects and complete loss of viral infectivity @xcite.in a future publication , we plan to discuss the case of capsid uncoating by fat dna toroids ( region ii in the uncoating diagram ) as well as implications of this uncoating diagram for the hiv life cycle .",
