    "within the last few years it has been demonstrated that cold gases of neutral atoms play an important role as quantum emulators , as these systems provide controllable devices available to simulate other systems of interest or theoretical models .",
    "the great flexibility of cold gases for which different types of atoms or interactions as well as their environment can be selected nearly at will , offer many possibilities @xcite . among them",
    "is the simulation of the quantum hall effect .    so far",
    "two main alternatives to engineer sufficiently strong artificial gauge fields to generate fractional - quantum - hall ( fqh ) states have been proposed .",
    "one is by atom - laser coupling and the other using rotating potential traps .",
    "when a neutral atom moves in a properly designed laser field , its center - of - mass motion may mimic the dynamics of a charged particle in a magnetic field .",
    "when the atom follows adiabatically one of its dressed states ( i.e. , local eigenstates of the atom - light coupling ) , artificial magnetism emerges , due to the accumulation of the berry phase @xcite .",
    "an alternative procedure to generate gauge fields is by the rotation of the trap potential that confines the system @xcite , where the rotation frequency @xmath0 plays the role of the magnetic field . in the regime of high magnetic flux , or rapid rotation in the case of a bosonic cloud ,",
    "theory predicts the appearance of strongly correlated phases .",
    "these phases can be viewed as the bosonic version of fqh states . moreover ,",
    "many - particle systems provide a rich variety of different phases of quantum matter .",
    "different proposals of classification can be found in literature @xcite .",
    "nowadays it is experimentally feasible to create artificial fields for ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices ( see @xcite , chap . 4 where a rather exhaustive analysis is made of the state of the art ) .",
    "proposals for abelian and even non - abelian gauge potentials exist , which in some cases are candidates to exhibit hall effect under special setups @xcite , and furthermore , some recent articles refer to valuable schemes to measure signatures of the hall effect @xcite .",
    "a new generation of proposals to generate fqh states is given by refs@xcite .",
    "however , experimental difficulties have prevented the observation of strongly correlated states .",
    "on the one hand , the use of laser beams comes with some drawbacks , such as heating of the atoms due to residual spontaneous emission @xcite , and on the other hand , in the case of rotating trap , if the number of atoms is large ( as is usually the case in experiments ) , the @xmath1-dependent critical rotation frequency needed to enter the strongly correlated regime is so close to the trap frequency that the system becomes unstable .",
    "nonetheless , vortex states have been experimentally obtained using both techniques @xcite .    in practice , the measurement of interesting observables in an experiment with few atoms and high density , the regime in which interactions are most relevant , is very challenging because we may not have access to the spatial density profile . with this in mind , we present an experimental proposal to simulate the few - particle system in each site of an optical lattice , wherewe choose the rotating trap - potential alternative .",
    "several interesting features are stressed : first , it is an ideal playground to test the properties of a hall system with strong interactions .",
    "second , the suggested experiment allows the study of a larger number of atoms than what is computationally feasible with our techniques .",
    "third , as the window of observability ( the range of @xmath0 values ) of strongly correlated states increases as @xmath1 decreases , the critical value of @xmath0 from which fqh states of few atoms are observable is far from the instability region . or in other words , taking advantage of the possibility to have few atoms per site ( @xmath2 ) we solve the experimental difficulty that has so far prevented the observation of fqh states for large systems . and",
    "finally , we introduce a method to measure the linear response using time - of - flight images , which do not require spatial resolution of the atomic profile in each lattice site .",
    "measuring characteristic properties of the highly correlated state is a very relevant problem",
    ". we will show below that the linear response function related to the hall effect provides valuable information about the eigenstates and phase transitions in the strongly correlated atomic system .",
    "this requires a measurement of the population of the `` scissor mode '' ( @xmath3 ) , which is hall excited by the `` breathing - mode '' perturbation @xmath4 ; see @xcite for the first experimental observation of the hall effect with atoms in the mean - field regime .",
    "we expect that experimentally the same informationwill be available in the hall response of the system , at least in the weak perturbation limit .",
    "we use the rotating frequency as the driven parameter and find that as the rotation increases , new phases emerge which are directly related to angular momentum transitions @xcite . to characterize the nature of the many - body ground states within a phase , we analyze the role played by its excitation spectrum in the hall dynamical response .",
    "we find that the hall response increases at phase transition points , and that it is modified in the presence of vortex states .",

    "@xmath20 fixes a term that breaks the isotropy of the trapping potential and is given by    @xmath21    where the dimensionless parameter @xmath22 measures the strength of the anisotropy . with this term ,",

    "we truncate the single - particle state label @xmath38 where @xmath47 and consequently the dimension of the hilbert space is fixed by the requirement of convergence of the results .",
    "we perform exact diagonalization and for convenience , analyze the hilbert space of many - body fock states in subspaces with fixed total angular momentum @xmath48 . in general @xmath48 is a non - well - defined parameter .",
    "we want to stress that the convergency condition in much more demanding for the hall response function than for the gs , as for the hall response all the excited states are involved and this is especilly the case if some anisotropy is included .",
    "we now propose an optical lattice implementation that produces the rotating trapped system assumed for each site in the previous section .",
    "the spirit of the proposal follows the work of popp et al .",
    "@xcite , using an optical lattice potential to isolate a few atoms per site and simulate the gauge field through a fast rotation per site . unlike the setup by gemelke et al .",
    "@xcite , our proposal relies on a optical superlattice with square geometry to create the rotation , not on the controlled interference of multiple beams with a time - averaged triangular lattice potential .",
    "more precisely , we consider a trapping potential in the @xmath7 direction stronger than any energy scale in our problem , so that our system can be regarded as purely bidimensional as was pointed out previously . we will assume a lattice potential deep enough to supress tunneling between sites ; in other words , each lattice site is to be regarded as an incoherent copy of the same experiment .",
    "the presence of the lattice is therefore important not only for confining a few - particles system , but also for signal amplification .",
    "we will now explain how the trapping potential can be implemented by modulations of the laser intensities .",

    "once we have the possibility to simulate magnetic fields acting on charged particles in an effective way , in the next step we are going to characterize our interacting many - body states using its susceptibility under weak perturbations . the philosophy is to perturb the system using a small oscillating term that moves the system in one direction ( say , the @xmath67 direction ) generating mass current and to measure the response of some observable @xmath68 that captures the torque experienced by the density distribution due to the presence of an effective magnetic field perpendicular to the @xmath69 plane .",

    "however , only quadrupolar excitations have non - zero contributions due to the quadrupolar nature of the perturbation @xmath87 .",

    "this value is just 10 times larger than when considering a ground - state with @xmath106 , which means that @xmath107 can be kept constant at all times .",
    "secondly , we must show that the quadrupolar excitations which can be probed with our hall response perturbations are lower in energy than the lattice bandgap , so that the single - well experiment approximation is fulfilled . for a deep lattice of @xmath108",

    "it is worth noting that , if @xmath0 is further increased , and the regime for @xmath115 is reached , the value of @xmath107 must be reviewed .",

    "take place , precisely where several eigenstates with different angular momentum become degenerate .",
    "these are the only values of @xmath0 where anisotropic configurations of the ground - state ( e.g. , two vortices ) are possible as linear combinations of the degenerate states .",
    "the analytic expression for the location of the first step is @xmath142 @xcite , where @xmath1 is the number of particles . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath143 , for which @xmath144 . if some anisotropy is considered ( @xmath145 or @xmath146 in fig.2 ) , the steps are smeared out .",
    "the transition takes place in a continuous way , over ranges of @xmath0 of finite size within which anisotropic configurations are possible .",
    "if the anisotropy is large ( @xmath119 in fig.2 ) the step structure disappears and is replaced by an increasing monotonous function , as shown by the large dots .",
    "if instead we increase the number of particles maintaining a small anisotropy , the efect on the function @xmath147 is qualitatively similar : the number of steps increases , a sequence of micro - plateaux appears @xcite and for large values of @xmath0 , @xmath148 becomes a nearly continiuos increasing function similar to the one shown in fig.2 for large anisotropy .",
    "figure 3 displays the spectrum @xmath149 versus @xmath0 over the plateau @xmath124 in the isotropic case . only the quadrupolar excitations to @xmath150 and @xmath126 are considered , since they are the significant ones for our choice of perturbation and observable operators @xmath68 and @xmath87 ( the operators @xmath151 and @xmath152 change @xmath48 in @xmath153 units ; see eq.(13 ) ) .",
    "once @xmath128 is fixed , every crossing of a constant horizontal line at @xmath154 with one of the lines of the spectrum is a candidate to be a peak of @xmath155 where , the resonant condition cancels the denominator in the second term of the right hand side of eq(12 ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath156 , as shown in fig.3 there are four crossings between the horizontal line at @xmath157 and the excitations with @xmath158 ( with negative slope ) or @xmath159 ( positive slope ) , as shown in fig.5(b ) , or for @xmath160 there are two crossings , as shown in fig.6 .",

    "the small peak ( visible in fig.5(a ) for @xmath172 in a different scale ) splits into two peaks which separate from each other .",
    "the important feature is that the height of the step at @xmath162 , not related to any resonant condition , also depends on @xmath128 .",
    "the small peak moves to the right following the crossings between the positive - slope line of the lowest excitation with @xmath126 ( see fig.3 ) and the values of @xmath128 .",
    "in fig.5 four typical cases are shown for the whole range of @xmath0 starting at @xmath173 .",
    "two different scales are considered : figs.5(a ) and 5(d ) up to @xmath174 and figs .",
    "5(b ) and 5(c ) up to @xmath175 . the first plateau from @xmath176 to @xmath177 is fully dominated by the dynamical response peaks . in contrast , the dynamical response decreases for larger @xmath48 . for @xmath178 ,",
    "the peaks disappear beyond @xmath160 . for @xmath179 ,",
    "close to the driving frequency chosen in ref.@xcite , the peaks completely disappear .",
    "two comments related to fig.5 are in order : the physical expected behaviour of the response is given by finit values in the limit @xmath180 ( see eq.(12 ) ) . in our simple model ,",
    "this is not the case as @xmath181 diverges in this limit at the resonant points .",
    "the inconvenience comes from the fact that we are not considering the width of the excitations that would prevent the divergence .",
    "the alternative procedure followed here is to consider a cutoff of @xmath182 such that we are close but out of resonance and the results are @xmath183 independent . therefore we obtain information about the presence of a peak but not of the details close to its center , where non - linear response is expected due to absorption . at the end",
    ", we characterize the ground state .",
    "the other comment refers to the absence of peaks for values of @xmath182 and @xmath154 where there is a crossing ( @xmath184 ( see fig.3 ) ) .",
    "the explanation of this possibility is , however , much technical .",
    "the absence of a peak means that @xmath185 and/or @xmath186 cancels , even though @xmath187 is a quadrupolar excitation .",
    "every eigenstate at @xmath182 has associated a specific set of non - zero single - particle occupations , say @xmath188 , where @xmath189 must not be an integer number . here",
    "@xmath190 labels the single - particle fock - darwin function @xmath191 defined previously . if the set defining @xmath192 ( or @xmath193 )",
    "has no coincidences with the set defining the excitation , then the numerator in eq.(12 ) cancels .",
    "furthermore , from the results shown in fig.5 we obtain the following useful information in the line of the characterization of the strongly correlated states .",
    "as @xmath182 increases , the entanglement of the gs grows since the sp occupations @xmath189 equalize , producing stationary states with internal structure far from condensation and mean - field description .",
    "the extreme case is the laughlin state with a nearly equal distribution of occupations , even for finite systems , showing large entanglement @xcite .",
    "this large entanglement has two consequencies : the hall response is large ( see fig.5(d ) ) and the gs is protected against absorptions at odds with the expected behaviour as there is a large amount of possibilities detected as crossings in the spectrum ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "figure 6 displays the case @xmath160 with a slight anisotropy ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "as expected , only the steps are modified due to the lifting of the degeneracy produced by the anisotropy .",
    "however , the peaks remain unchanged .    as previously noted in sec .",
    "iii , the guideline of our performance has close connection with the first experimental observation of the hall effect with atoms @xcite .",
    "a brief explanation of the main ingredients of the experiment is as follows .",
    "the initial state is a large ( @xmath194 ) strongly deformed cloud of bosons in a superfluid regime . by atom - laser coupling",
    ", they submit the system to an artificial magnetic field @xmath195 perpendicular to the cloud .",
    "next the system is perturbed along the @xmath161 direction with a time - dependent modification of the trap potential given by @xmath196 equivalent to a force linear in @xmath161 .",
    "finally , they measure the time evolution of the second - order moment @xmath197 of the density .",
    "their main result is the oscillation of @xmath198 if @xmath199 or zero otherwise .",
    "this @xmath195-dependent correlation transport ( in the @xmath161 and @xmath67 directions ) is the hall response . in their fig.4 ,",
    "the one with which we contrast our results , they show the amplitude of the oscillations of @xmath197 as a function of @xmath195 for a fixed @xmath154 .",
    "the result is a monotonous increasing function that closely follows the superfluid hydrodynamic equations up to a point where @xmath195 is strong enough to generate vortex states ; from this point , experimental points depart from the hydrodynamic prediction , and hall response has lower values than those predicted by the model .",
    "according to our results , for small systems and negligible deformation , classifying the states by their ability to manifest the hall effect is equivalent to classifying the states by their angular momentum @xmath48 , that is , the phase transitions lie at the steps .",
    "furthermore , following this similarity between hall response and angular momentum we are naturally brought to an extrapolation : if we increase @xmath1 ( increasing the number of steps in @xmath200 @xcite ) and simultaneously add some deformation , we expect for a hall response a monotonous increasing function as the one shown by the large dots of fig.2 , in close agreement with ref.@xcite as discussed in the above paragraph .    to complete our comparison , we analyzed the role played by the vortex states for large values of @xmath195 . to this end , we moved to @xmath201 and analyzed this posibility .",
    "the sequence of @xmath148 for @xmath202 atoms is : @xmath203 and @xmath204 . in the step produced by the change of @xmath48 from @xmath174 to @xmath205",
    "the creation of a two - vortex state is possible .",
    "a very small anisotropy is enough to mix states of different angular momentum and facilitate the precise numerical calculation of the value of @xmath0 at the vortex state .",
    "different hall response , related to the general tendency , was expected for a vortex state due to its different set of sp occupations @xmath188 as compared with a state laying on a plateau .",
    "this difference is related to the more demanding convergency condition in the numerical calculation for the vortex case . for a system laying on a plateau , a single occupation is dominant ( the degree of condensation of the state is high ) but in contrast two of the occupations play an important role in the vortex state @xcite .",
    "unexpectedly , our result and the experiment goes in the opposite directions ; fig.7 shows a slight increase .",
    "it is difficult to follow the numerics to infer any difference when increasing @xmath1 , or more importantly , when increasing the deformation ( up to a quasi - one - dimensional system which is the case in the experiment ) , two possible reasons of the discrepancy .    finally , a comment about the term `` hall response '' .",
    "we have followed the nomenclature used in the experimental work @xcite which is an attempt to mimic the behavoiur of real charges under magnetic and electric fields .",
    "we believe that the observation of the torque of the density when the system is displaced in one direction , which has a significant value only in the case of non - zero @xmath23 , is related to the hall effect and can be used to clasify the states .",
    "the absence of response would clasify the state outside the set of @xmath206-type states .",
    "however , it must be noted that it is far from the simulation of the appropriate transport equation given by @xmath207 where the conductivity @xmath208 or its inverse , the resistivity , show the hall effect characterized by plateaux when analyzed as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "( dimensionless ) versus @xmath0 for @xmath209 with a slight anisotropy ( @xmath210 ) has been considered .",
    "the frequencies are in units of @xmath116.,width=321 ]    , upper part ) and the modulus of the hall response @xmath85 ( dimensionless , lower part ) as functions of @xmath0 for @xmath201 .",
    "the upward peak at @xmath211 ( signaled by an arrow ) corresponds to a two - vortex state ; @xmath212 is considered .",
    "the frequencies are in units of @xmath116.,width=359 ]",
    "in this work we have studied a system of interacting bosonic atoms under a strong effective magnetic field .",
    "such systems are known to exhibit a variety of phases , ranging from bose - einstein condensation to highly correlated states ( pfaffian states , laughling liquids , etc ) .",
    "while progress in experimental manipulation of ultracold atoms is advancing steadily , there is a huge need for new tools to probe and learn about the physics of strongly correlated states .",
    "our work shows that the linear response can be a very useful method to get information about many - body atomic systems , both from the point of view of phase transitions , signalling the changes between different symmetries ( the transition from @xmath106 to @xmath213 e.g. , involves a broken parity symmetry at the single particle level @xcite ) , and also for accurately analyzing the role played by the excitations . in what follows",
    ", we first summarize the whole experimental protocol , next briefly explain our results and finally , present our interpretations and comments .",
    "we propose an experimental setup using an optical lattice , where several incoherent copies of a few - particle hall state can be prepared .",
    "we have shown that the system can be prepared in a ground state with fixed angular momentum : a bec is adiabatically loaded into an optical lattice with local deformation and rotation and once the system is in its ground state , the deformation is adiabaticaly switched off while keeping @xmath48 constant .",
    "next the system is perturbed by using laser intensity modulations at a particular frequency @xmath128 , and when the stationary state is achieved , the lattice is switched off and a time - off - flight imaging of the cloud is performed .",
    "this measurement provides the density distribution required to build the density moment @xmath214 ( see eq.(11 ) ) and from it , the linear hall response @xmath85 .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows : in the isotropic case , the phase transitions related to the hall response take place at critical values of @xmath0 where changes in @xmath48 occur in a stepwise well - known variation . within a fixed phase , peaks at some specific values of @xmath0 and @xmath128 provide information about the excited states and characterize the dynamical response of the ground state within this phase .",
    "more importantly , we find a relationship between the hall response and the correlation in the gs . as the correlation ( or entanglement )",
    "increases , the hall response grows ; in contrast , the dynamical response explicited by the resonant absorption peaks nearly disappears for perturbation frequencies comparable to the excitation energies . for a vortex state of six atoms",
    ", we obtain a slight increase of the hall response as compared with states without vortices at close @xmath0 .",
    "signatures of hall response would be obtained if a stepwise structure of @xmath215 is observed for large @xmath128 ( see fig.5(d ) ) , each of the plateaux related with a correlated ground state .",
    "one of the advantages of our implementation having isolated sites is that there is no influence of the lattice on the structure of the gs as is the case of other possibilities proposed to create fqh states , where a compromise must be achieved : the magnetic flux piercing each cell must be strong enough to produce the fqh state and at the same time , small enough to cancel the influence of the lattice avoiding the modification of the state @xcite .",
    "the identification of the correlated states could be possibly complemented by a local measurement of the two - body correlation function .",
    "other ways to see the correlations between the particles has been proposed in ref.@xcite using bragg spectroscopy .",
    "the presence of an excited state is expected to produce a large response at a particular value of @xmath128 and consequently , energeticaly determined . in the case of vortex states ,",
    "our result , which is at odds with the behaviour shown in @xcite , is not conclusive .",
    "extra analysis therefore is necessary for a larger number of atoms and/or vortices .",
    "however , having different hall response as compared with the states without vortices , its presence can be detected experimentaly .",
    "furthermore , according to our analysis , the stepwise variation of the hall response , can be used to infer the angular momentum of the isotropic initial ground state .",
    "two extensions of our analysis could , in principle , be obtained from experimental results : one is the inspection of the response close to the absorption peaks , inaccesible to our linear response calculations . the other is the analysis of the evolution of the hall response as @xmath1 is simultaneously increased in each site , as a test of the expected extrapolated results .",
    "more importantly , the experimental difficulty that so far has prevented the observation of fqh states for large systems is expected to be solved in our setup , since lower rotation frequencies far from instability at @xmath216 are required to reach the fqh regime .",
    "furthermore , from our optical lattice implementation , we obtain an analytical expression for the trap potential frequency @xmath216 as a function of the laser beams and the atoms involved in the experiment .    the ideas in this manuscript are intimately related to the work by leblanc et al  @xcite . however , we must point out that the experimental results reported in that paper were obtained with strongly deformed ( with a nearly cigar shape ) bose - einstein condensates in the hydrodynamic regimes , with a large number of particles and a purely mean - field treatment . on the contrary , the states that we have studied in this work involve a small number of atoms in a symmetric trap , with a strong dominance of the interaction for large rotation speeds .",
    "moreover , we have resolved the transition from vortex - free regime to the regime with vortices , going beyond the hydrodynamical analysis present in that work .",
    "we are indebted with the referee and with m. rizzi for all their suggestions and comments . h.p .",
    "are greatly benefited from discussions with maciej lewenstein . this work is partially sopported by the spanish mec through the fpu grant no.ap 2009 - 1761 , the eu through the promisce project , the spanish mincin fis2010 - 16185 , the consolider cpan project csd2007 - 00042 and the generalitat de catalunya program under contracts 2009sgr502 and 2009sgr21 .",
    "our goal in this appendix is to obtain the relationship between the hamiltonian used in section iia for a single site ( in the rotating frame of reference ) and the appropriate laser beam implementation in the laboratory frame to reproduce it .",
    "to start , we rewrite eq.(2 ) as @xmath217 where @xmath218 is given by eq.(5 ) and @xmath219 is the angular momentum operator in the @xmath7 direction . from this expression , it is clear that the only term that must be translated from the rotating to the laboratory frame is @xmath218 since @xmath220 is invariant @xcite . to this end",
    ", we analyze eq.(5 ) in two terms :      or following the convention given in the text about upper and lowercase letters , in the laboratory frame the trap potential reads @xmath222 @xmath223 @xmath224,\\ ] ] where we have used the rotation matrix @xmath225 with @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "we now consider on the one hand , that the intensity of a standing wave in the @xmath228,@xmath229 and @xmath230 directions are given by @xmath231 , @xmath232 and @xmath233 respectively ( being @xmath234 ) , where @xmath235 is the amplitud of the electric and @xmath236 ( @xmath237 ) is its wave vector . and",
    "on the other hand , that the coupling of the laser with the atomic induced dipolar moment @xmath238 is @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the total intensity @xcite . next , considering these two results , we can express eqs.(a3 ) in terms of the laser - atom coupling in a periodic configuration .",
    "previously , we want to stress that from eqs.(a3 ) it can be inferred that considering only the first term in the expansion of @xmath241 , two standing waves on the @xmath53 and @xmath54 directions are sufficient to generate a symmetric time - independent trap potential , however , a third laser in the @xmath56 direction is necessary to deform and rotate it . we can rewrite the eqs.(a3 ) as        we assumed that the atomic polarizability is @xmath244 and made the rotating wave approximation . identifying terms ,",
    "finally we obtain the main result @xmath245 or in other words , we have explicitly obtained the relation between the trapping frequency and the experimental parameters of our configuration ( the atomic polarizability @xmath246 , the wave vector @xmath66 , and the intensity of the lasers @xmath247 ) .",
    "finally , the term of the hamiltonian that generates a periodic @xmath248 is given by @xmath249 where @xmath59 , \\nonumber \\\\",
