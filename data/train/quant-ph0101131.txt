    "an interest of physicists in complex potentials @xmath8 with the generalized symmetry property v(x ) = rev(-x ) ,",
    "v(x ) = -imv(-x ) [ pts ] dates back to the perturbative study of imaginary cubic anharmonic oscillators v(x ) = x^2 + ix^3 [ ixnatri ] by caliceti et al @xcite . in the early nineties ,",
    "an increase of this interest @xcite was inspired by the role of the imaginary cubic anharmonicity in field theory where eq .",
    "( [ pts ] ) mimics the fundamental parity times time - reversal (= @xmath1 ) symmetry of phenomenological lagrangians @xcite . under certain circumstances ,",
    "the @xmath1 symmetric and hermitian models can even prove mathematically equivalent @xcite .    in the late nineties , bender and",
    "boettcher @xcite analysed the one - parametric family of the power - law @xmath9 models v(x ) = x^2 ( ix)^[ixnadelta ] by the quasi - classical and purely numerical means . on this basis",
    "they conjectured that all the @xmath10 bound - state energies @xmath11 form a real and discrete , smooth continuation of the well known harmonic - oscillator @xmath12 spectrum .",
    "an extension of this study inspired them later to apply the conjecture ( formulated , originally , by bessis at @xmath13 @xcite ) to a still broader class of interactions . within the resulting  generalized \"",
    "( so called @xmath1 symmetric ) quantum mechanics @xcite , there appears a growing number of interesting studies , promoting the ideas of supersymmetry @xcite , exact semiclassical techniques @xcite , functional analysis @xcite and perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "all of them provide a consistent picture of a theory with certain ( not quite well understood ) limitations . even in the above  guiding \" example ( [ ixnadelta ] ) the @xmath1 symmetry breaks down spontaneously at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "phenomenological appeal of the @xmath1 symmetric modifications need not even stop before the  sacred \" quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "still , the formalism abounds in open questions and its mathematical foundations are mostly conjectures .",
    "this is the reason why the attention quickly spreads from the phenomenologically oriented eq .",
    "( [ ixnadelta ] ) to its exactly solvable alternatives . in this direction , the partially solvable extension of the @xmath15 quartic case @xcite and the discovery of the exact solvability of the certain version of the @xmath16 limiting case",
    "@xcite were the first and encouraging successes .",
    "they were followed by the @xmath1 symmetric regularization of the more - dimensional harmonic oscillator @xcite and by the formulation and solution of many further shape - invariant models @xcite-@xcite .",
    "once we move beyond the domain of analytic potentials , numerical studies provide significantly less encouraging results @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why the  most elementary \" square well v(x ) = 0 ,  x ( -1,1 ) + imv(x ) = z ,  x ( -1,0 ) + imv(x ) = -z ,  x ( 0,1 ) [ sqw ] has always been @xmath1 symmetrized just in the ( various , non - equivalent ) @xmath16 limits of eq .",
    "( [ ixnadelta ] )  @xcite .",
    "presumably , the reason for absence of the  forgotten \" @xmath1 symmetric square well ( [ sqw ] ) in the literature lies in an ambiguity of its continuation beyond the discontinuities at @xmath17 .",
    "we are going to treat this problem simply by imposing the dirichlet boundary conditions on our ( complex ) wave functions , ( 1 ) = 0 .",
    "[ bc ] having made the latter decision the explicit computations are really elementary .",
    "their essence lies in the easy construction of the general right and left solutions _",
    "+ = c_+ e^x + d_+ e^-x + _ - = c_- e^^x + d_- e^-^x [ gens ] with the complex @xmath18 and its conjugate @xmath19 .",
    "we re - parametrize the ( by assumption , real ) energies @xmath20 and the measure of non - hermiticity @xmath21 .",
    "this gives the complex exponents @xmath22 since @xmath23 is also complex ( and constant for all @xmath24 ) .",
    "our solutions ( [ gens ] ) are made explicit , for every real @xmath25 and @xmath26 , when we use the inverse formulae t=(e+)^1/2 , s=(e+)^-1/2 . in the light of the @xmath1 symmetry of our hamiltonian @xmath27 ,",
    "the product @xmath28 will satisfy the same schrdinger equation as @xmath29 .",
    "hence , in the origin , we are permitted to normalize our bound states in a @xmath1 symmetric way , _ + ( 0)=_-(0)=1 ,  _ x_+(0)=_x_-(0)=ia .",
    "these conditions contain a free real parameter @xmath30 and are equivalent to the matching of wave functions , c _ = 1 - d _ , + ( 1 - 2d_+ ) = ^(1 - 2d_-)=ia .",
    "this implies that we know all the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ gens ] ) , d_+= - i ,  d_-= - i. it is easy to satisfy the external boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) and reduce them to the elementary prescription ia=- .",
    "[ bcexpl ] in terms of the real parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 this represents a system of two algebraic equations , a=- + t s = s t + . [ graph ] its first part defines the ( necessarily , real ) value of @xmath33 .",
    "a re - arrangement of the second algebraic equation is elementary and gives the rule -2t2",
    "[ hical ] as long as both its sides depend on the mere absolute values of the respective variables @xmath32 and @xmath31 , we may pick up @xmath34 , insert the definition of @xmath35 and solve this equation numerically .",
    "by construction , the spectrum of the real energies @xmath36 is defined in terms of the roots @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ hical ] ) , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "after we re - scale @xmath41 , we immediately see that in the limit @xmath2 this spectrum degenerates to the known hermitian one , with @xmath42 etc . from our equation ( [ hical ] ) it is obvious that at the very small @xmath26 ( and , hence , @xmath43 ) , the change of the above roots @xmath44 ( and , of course , energies ) remains very small as well .    at the larger ( and ,",
    "say , positive ) @xmath26 , the analysis of our quantization condition ( [ hical ] ) becomes significantly simplified by the re - scalings @xmath45 and @xmath46 such that , say , @xmath47 .",
    "both these steps represent a one - to - one mapping exhibiting the strict leading - order quasi - linearity @xmath48 achieved at both ends of our half - axis , i.e. , for @xmath49 as well as for @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , this introduces just a minimal deformation of the scale of the coordinate @xmath31 ( practically invisible on a picture ) and replaces equation ( [ hical ] ) by a new one , -tt = 4 ^ 2 s. [ hicalbe ] this new relation is explicitly solvable .",
    "the resulting analytic and @xmath51independent formula @xmath52 defines a curve in our new @xmath53 plane .",
    "its @xmath54 part is displayed in figure  1 .    in order to determine the separate roots @xmath44 ( and , hence , the spectrum of energies ) ,",
    "it remains for us to recollect the @xmath51dependent , hyperbolic constraint @xmath35 .",
    "after we translate its form in our new variables , @xmath55 , we discover that it has a monotonous , hyperbolic shape which depends on @xmath26 .",
    "figure  1 offers a few samples .",
    "we may conclude that each point of the intersection of our two curves @xmath56 and @xmath57 determines a @xmath51dependent root @xmath58 and , hence , a real energy .",
    "the @xmath51 dependence of the roots @xmath59 is , in general , smooth .",
    "a non - perturbative effect is only encountered at certain critical values @xmath60 . in the vicinity of these points , the two leftmost roots @xmath61 , @xmath62 merge in a single , doubly degenerate real root @xmath63 .",
    "figure  1 gives two examples and shows that even the smallest one of these critical values is already quite large ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "below this bound we may summarize that    * our complexified square well generates the infinite set of real energies ; * the roots @xmath44 which define these energies are almost equidistant , especially at the higher @xmath65 ; * as expected , the standard square - well - type behaviour of the spectrum is reproduced at the small @xmath26 and for the highly excited states .    in the strongly non - hermitian domain ,",
    "the lowest doublets of states subsequently disappear .",
    "presumably , their energies dissolve in conjugate pairs in complex plane .",
    "the @xmath1 symmetry of their wave functions breaks down .",
    "the related solutions become  unphysical \" and have to be omitted in a way paralleling the similar  disappearance of states \" at @xmath66 in the model ( [ ixnadelta ] ) of ref .",
    "the resulting sudden upward jump of the ground - state energy definitely enters the list of paradoxes , emerging in the other exactly solvable models .",
    "their present list already involves the unavoided level crossings in the harmonic and coulomb oscillators @xcite , the anomalously large excitations in the @xmath1 symmetrized but bounded rosen - morse field @xcite , some unexpected manifestations of the strong singularities in the psch - teller and eckart models @xcite , and a spontaneous re - ordering of levels in the morse asymmetric well  @xcite .    in this context , the role of the complexified square well is as exceptional as in the hermitian limit .",
    "we may expect that its generalizations with more points of discontinuity will remain tractable analytically .",
    "this could be of a significant help , say , within perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "in the more pragmatic numerical setting , one should recollect that the so called prfer transformation @xcite ( i.e. , nothing but a square - well - inspired use of the _ locally _ exponential solutions ) found a firm place in the standard computer software @xcite .",
    "last but not least , one has to keep in mind that in the hermitian quantum mechanics the use of the locally constant forces could also clarify the various manifestations of the pertaining sturm liouville theory @xcite .",
    "an appropriate @xmath1 symmetrization of this theory is expected to be quite a difficult task @xcite .",
    "in such a direction , also the knowledge of our present solutions could mediate a further progress , hopefully , in the near future .",
