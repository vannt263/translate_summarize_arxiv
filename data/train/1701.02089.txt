    "type iib supernovae ( sne ) belong to the class of hydrogen - poor core - collapse sne .",
    "they appear as a type ii sn initially but gradually turn into a type ib sn days to weeks after the explosion .",
    "this property can be best explained by a progenitor star having a small amount of hydrogen ( @xmath6 ) in the envelope .",
    "the inferred pre - explosion masses of type iib sn ( hereafter , sn iib ) progenitors are typically about 3 - 6  @xmath0 ( e.g. , sn 1993j , @xcite , @xcite ; sn 2008ax , @xcite ; sn 2011dh , @xcite ; sn 2011fu , @xcite ; sn 2011ei , @xcite ; sn 2011hs , @xcite ; sn 2013df , @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that their immediate progenitors are not massive wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars of wnh type , which are more massive than 8 - 10  @xmath7 , and that the initial mass of a sn iib progenitor is in the range of 10 - 18  @xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore most likely that sn iib progenitors have their hydrogen envelope mainly removed by roche - lobe overflow rather than by stellar wind mass loss  @xcite .",
    "the progenitors of a few sne iib have been directly identified in pre - sn images as supergiants with a radius @xmath8 200  @xmath9 ( i.e. , sn 1993j , sn 2011dh , and sn 2013df ; @xcite ) .",
    "comparison with stellar evolution and supernova models implies that these progenitors had an inflated hydrogen envelope of a small mass .",
    "the luminosities of these progenitors are in the range of @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding intial mass is in the range of 11 - 17  @xmath0 , which is consistent with the inferred pre - explosion masses of 3 - 6  @xmath0 .",
    "the inflated hydrogen envelope of supergiant progenitors significantly influences the early - time light curves of sne iib during the shock - cooling phase .",
    "in particular , several studies conclude that the sustained high luminosity at early times observed in some sne iib is related to this inflated hydrogen envelope ( e.g. , sn 1993j , sn 2011hs , sn 2011fu & sn 2013df ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , observations indicate that not all sne iib have a supergiant progenitor . for example , very weak or no sign of sustained brightness at early times before the rise to the @xmath11ni - powered peak in the light curve is found for sn 1996cb and 2008ax  @xcite , which implies their progenitors were fairly compact .",
    "the analysis of sn 2008ax by @xcite indicates that its progenitor had a radius of @xmath12 and a pre - explosion mass of about 4  5  @xmath0 .",
    "evolutionary models with initial masses of 13 - 18  @xmath13 also indicate that solutions for compact sn iib progenitors ( @xmath14 ) can be obtained with binary systems of relatively short initial periods ( @xmath15 ; @xcite ) , while red - supergiant progenitors can be produced with much longer initial periods ( @xmath16 ; @xcite ) .",
    "a yellow supergiant progenitor could be obtained with an initial period of @xmath17  d  @xcite .",
    "the observational diversity of the signatures of interaction with circumstellar matter for some sne iib may also reflect different histories of mass loss due to different progenitor properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the stellar evolution studies quoted above mostly focused on explaining specific cases for sn iib progenitors .",
    "the purpose of this study is to have a more comprehensive view on the properties of sn iib progenitors and to discuss the observational diversity of sne iib . for this purpose , we present a new grid of binary star evolution covering a range of initial primary - star mass ( 10  18  @xmath0 ) and a range of initial period ( @xmath18  10  3000  d ) for two different metallicities ( solar and large magellanic cloud values ) . although our discussion is focused on sn iib progenitors , sne iib and ib form a continuous sequence of the increasing loss of the hydrogen - rich envelope and therefore represent a unique family ( distinct from sne ic ) . in this context ,",
    "our model grid includes sne ib progenitor models for which no hydrogen is left in the envelope .",
    "we compare their properties at the final stage with those of sn iib progenitors .",
    "this complements our previous work on the properties of sn ib / c progenitors  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the numerical method and physical assumptions adopted for our evolutionary models in section  [ sect : method ] .",
    "the main results are presented in section  [ sect : results ] , the properties of sn iib and sn ib progenitors at the final stage are discussed in sections  [ sect : sniib ] and  [ sect : snib ] , respectively .",
    "the effect of metallicity on progenitor properties is addressed in section  [ sect : metallicity ] .",
    "we conclude our study in section  [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "the model grid presented in this study has been calculated with the mesa code  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the schwarzschild criterion for convection .",
    "we consider convective overshoot using a step function over a layer of thickness @xmath19 above the hydrogen burning convective core , where @xmath20 is the pressure scale height at the outer boundary of the core .",
    "we use the dutch scheme in mesa for both hot and cool wind mass loss rates , with the dutch scaling factor of 1.0 .    the energy transport efficiency by convection is usually parameterized by the mixing length @xmath21 in units of @xmath20 .",
    "we adopt the default value of mesa ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we do not employ the artificial boost of convective energy transport using an excessive temperature gradient in the convective envelope that was introduced by  @xcite .",
    "we employ the optically thick mass transfer prescription by @xcite for calculating the mass transfer rate .",
    "this is well suited for the case of mass transfer from a supergiant star whose pressure scale height in the outer layers may become comparable to the size of the star  @xcite .",
    "the standard ritter scheme  @xcite can be applied only if the pressure scale height at the stellar surface is much smaller than the stellar radius ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we do not consider rotation in this study , but assume non - conservative mass transfer as predicted by previous binary models including the effects of rotation  @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the mass accretor is quickly spun up to critical rotation during a mass transfer phase , and the stellar wind mass loss rate from the accretor dramatically increases accordingly , which effectively results in highly non - conservative mass transfer . in our calculation , therefore , we assume the ratio of the accreted mass to the transferred mass ( i.e. , the mass accretion efficiency @xmath24 ) is 0.2 . in this picture , the non - accreted matter is blown away from the binary system as a fast wind from the mass accretor , and the corresponding angular momentum loss from the orbit is calculated accordingly .    we considered four different primary star masses and two different metallicities : @xmath25 11 , 13 , 16 , and 18  @xmath0 , and @xmath26 0.02 and 0.007 , which roughly correspond to solar and large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) metallicities respectively .",
    "the mass ratio is fixed to @xmath27 for all models in our grid . to make a robust prediction on the event rates of sne ib and iib from binary systems",
    ", we would need to consider a wider range of mass ratio  @xcite , but it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the properties of the primary star at the end of the calculation for each sequence are summarized in tables  [ tab1 ] ,  [ tab2 ] , and  [ tab3 ] .",
    "lmc and solar metallicity models have reference names starting with l and s , respectively ( lm11p100 , sm13p500 , etc . ) .",
    "names starting with t refer to test models with a reduced mass loss rate at solar metallicity ( e.g. , tm11p20 ; see section  [ sect : massloss ] ) .",
    "each name also contains the information of the initial mass of the primary star and the initial period .",
    "for example , lm11p100 refers to the sequence with @xmath28 and @xmath29  d at lmc metallicity .",
    "the model evolution is halted when the central temperature @xmath30 reaches @xmath31  k in most cases .",
    "the evolution of lm11p300 , sm13p50 and sm13p1700 is calculated to the pre - sn stage to check if there would be any significant change in the surface properties ( i.e. , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) from this point . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : change ] , the envelope structure remains almost unchanged , because of very short evolutionary time from @xmath34  k until core - collapse ( @xmath35  yr ) . in the sequences sm10p50 and sm10p200 , the carbon - oxygen core becomes electron - degenerate as its mass approaches 1.4  @xmath0 .",
    "off - center oxygen burning starts in these models before reaching @xmath34  k , and we stopped the calculation at this point because the time step becomes extremely small .",
    "it is likely that these models result in sn ib progenitors , but we leave their final fate open in the present study .",
    "0.5 cm    within the parameter space we considered in the present study , the primary star undergoes case b mass transfer : roche - lobe overflow after core hydrogen exhaustion and before core helium exhaustion . for our discussion , we further distinguish case b as follows :    * case eb ( early case b ) : mass transfer while the primary star crosses the hertzsprung gap on the hr diagram .",
    "* case lb ( late case b ) : mass transfer after the hydrogen envelope of the primary star becomes fully convective .    after case",
    "eb / lb mass transfer , a second mass transfer from the primary star may occur after core helium exhaustion .",
    "this case is referred to as case ebb / lbb .",
    "we can roughly predict the resultant sn type from our models based on their structures . a sn iib progenitor must contain some hydrogen in the envelope but the hydrogen envelope mass ( @xmath36 ) should not exceed a certain limit as otherwise the resultant supernova would appear as a sn iil or iip .",
    "this upper limit of @xmath36 would depend on the supernova parameters including supernova energy , total ejecta mass , and chemical composition . in the present study",
    ", we assume the condition of @xmath37 for sn iib progenitors .",
    "in addition , we categorize our sn iib progenitor models into three groups according to their surface temperatures at the final stage as the following :    * sn iib - b : blue progenitors ( @xmath38 ; e.g. sn 2008ax and sn 2016gkg ) ) to be called a giant star , and therefore we do not refer our blue progenitor models to blue supergiant progenitors . ] * sn iib - y : yellow supergiant ( ysg ) progenitors ( @xmath39 ; e.g. , sn 2011dh ) * sn iib - r : red supergiant ( rsg ) progenitors ( @xmath40 ; e.g. , sn 1993j and sn 2013df )    our temperature criterion for ysgs is adopted from  @xcite .",
    "note that in the literature , there is ambiguity about the definition of ysgs : some authors consider progenitors of sn 1993j and 2013df as ysgs  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are rsgs according to our definition .",
    "in the case where no hydrogen is left , we assume that a sn ib would occur .",
    "the remaining helium mass in this case is higher than about @xmath41 , for which helium can not be easily hidden in supernova spectra for the final mass range of our sn ib models ( @xmath42 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we summarize the result of our calculations in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] , where the predicted final fate of the primary star is indicated in the plane spanned by the initial period and initial mass . as shown in the figure ,",
    "sn iib progenitors are expected for a larger parameter space at lmc metallicity than at solar metallicity .",
    "the figure also shows the dependence of the progenitor type on the initial orbital period ( @xmath43 ) and the initial mass of the primary star ( @xmath44 ) , as explained below in greater detail .",
    "it is well known that an initially tighter orbit leads to a deeper stripping of the hydrogen envelope via mass transfer .",
    "this effect of the initial separation can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr11lmc ] , as an example with @xmath45 .    with relatively short initial orbits ( @xmath46 10  d and 100  d ) , case eb mass transfer occurs .",
    "in this case , most of the hydrogen envelope remains radiative at the onset of mass transfer , and strong mass loss leads to thermal disequilibrium of the envelope .",
    "the luminosity of the primary star rapidly drops accordingly  ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) until the total mass decreases to about 7  @xmath0 and 8  @xmath0 for @xmath46  10  d and 100  d , respectively . the star gradually becomes brighter thereafter as the surface mass fraction of hydrogen decreases . once the mass transfer stops , both the radius and the luminosity of the star decrease until thermal equilibrium is restored .",
    "after core helium exhaustion , the envelope expands again until the end point .",
    "the surface temperature at the end point is @xmath47 and 3.79 for @xmath46  10 and 100  d , respectively .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sect : mhenv ] below in more detail , the final surface temperature tends to be lower for a higher hydrogen envelope mass that remains until the end , which is in turn determined by the initial orbital separation .    in the sequences with @xmath46700  d and 1000  d ,",
    "mass transfer occurs when the hydrogen envelope of the primary star is fully convective ( case lb ) .",
    "the response to mass loss of a convective envelope is very different from that of a radiative envelope  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr11lmc ] , the radius initially increases once the primary star begins to transfer mass to its companion . in the sequence of @xmath48  700  d , after the mass transfer stops",
    ", the star undergoes a blueward evolution on the hr diagram .",
    "the star turns to the red again and becomes a rsg at the final stage . on the other hand",
    ", the hr diagram of the sequence with @xmath48  1000  d does not show the blue loop .",
    "this is because the hydrogen envelope mass remains sufficiently large to preserve the rsg structure .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdotlmc ] , the evolution of the mass transfer rate from the 11  @xmath0 and 18  @xmath0 primary stars is presented for three different initial periods .",
    "we note that case eb mass transfer ( @xmath46  100  d for 11  @xmath0 and @xmath48  300  d for 18  @xmath0 ) lasts longer than case lb mass transfer , which explains the deeper stripping of the hydrogen envelope with case eb .",
    "with case lb mass transfer , the duration and mass transfer rate become smaller with a longer initial period .",
    "there are two mass transfer phases for the 11  @xmath0 model .",
    "the first one is responsible for most of the stripping of the hydrogen envelope .",
    "the second one is a brief phase with a lower mass transfer rate , which occurs after core helium exhaustion as the primary star tends to expand during the final evolutionary stages .",
    "this second mass transfer is less favored in more massive systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mdotlmc ] ; see also tables  [ tab1 ] ,  [ tab2 ] , and  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "this is because of the following two factors .",
    "1 ) the case ebb mass transfer ( i.e. , the second mass transfer after the case eb mass transfer ) is commonly observed for relatively low - mass stars  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the envelope expansion after core helium exhaustion is more prominent with a more compact stellar core . on the other hand ,",
    "higher mass stars ( @xmath49 ) tend to remain more compact provided @xmath50 after the case eb mass transfer .",
    "2 ) the case lbb mass transfer ( i.e. , the second mass transfer after the case lb mass transfer ) is also driven by the expansion of the remaining hydrogen envelope . for more massive systems , however , stronger stellar winds tend to make the orbit wider , preventing the primary star from undergoing further mass transfer .    although mass transfer is the main determining factor for the final envelope structure of sn progenitors in binary systems , the effect of wind mass loss can also play an important role .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , mass transfer can not completely remove hydrogen from the primary star even with case eb . whether the progenitor can retain some hydrogen until core collapse depends on the subsequent history of mass loss by stellar winds .",
    "stellar winds are stronger for higher masses , and no hydrogen is left in case eb systems with @xmath51 at @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ; table  [ tab1 ] ) .    with our assumption of @xmath53 , the case eb and case",
    "lb regimes are separated by the contact regime for the sequences with @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ) . with a larger value of @xmath24",
    ", the regime for contact would be enlarged .    in terms of the final fate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ) , solutions for sn iib - b and sn iib - y progenitors are found only for @xmath55 in our considered parameter space .",
    "sn iib - r solutions are found for all the considered mass range .",
    "the tendency that the surface temperature gradually decreases with increasing @xmath43 for a given initial mass can be explained by the fact that less hydrogen is removed in the case of a wider orbit .",
    "the mass transfer history of solar metallicity models is qualitatively similar to that of lmc metallicity models .",
    "a shorter initial orbit leads to more significant stripping of the hydrogen envelope , and vice versa .",
    "however , the role of stellar winds becomes more important , compared to the lmc case .",
    "the most notable difference between solar and lmc metallicity models is observed in the outcome of case eb mass transfer . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] , hydrogen is completely removed via stellar winds during the post case eb mass transfer phase ( see also table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the solutions of sn iib - b and sn iib - y that are found with lmc metallicity with @xmath56 are replaced by sn ib solutions .",
    "strong winds also significantly affect the evolution with case lb mass transfer .",
    "narrow regimes for sn iib - b solutions appear with @xmath57 and 18  @xmath0 , which are not found at lmc metallicity .",
    "this is because the primary star loses a significant amount of hydrogen during the blue loop phase where the wr mass loss rate of @xcite is applied ( see section  [ sect : massloss ] below ) after case lb mass transfer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hr16zsol ] ) . at @xmath58 , a sn iib - y solution",
    "is also found in - between sn iib - b and sn iib - r regimes ( figs .",
    "[ fig : result ] and  [ fig : hr16zsol ] ) .",
    "in general , rsg solutions are dominant for sn iib progenitors at solar metallicity .",
    "however , many of the sn iib - r progenitor models have higher surface temperatures ( @xmath59 ) than those of ordinary rsgs observed in the local universe ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the progenitor properties of sn 1993j and sn 2013df , for which @xmath60 was inferred observationally  @xcite .      as discussed above , the evolution of the primary star after the major mass transfer phase is critically affected by stellar wind mass loss . in particular , the primary star spends most of the remaining evolutionary time on the helium main sequence as a hydrogen - poor star after case eb mass transfer .",
    "the wr mass loss rate by @xcite ( hereafter , the nl rate ) is applied for this case .",
    "however , the nl rate was inferred from galactic wr stars , which are much more massive ( @xmath61 ) and therefore much more luminous than our primary star models during the post mass transfer phase ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the validity of the nl rate for these relatively low - mass hydrogen - poor hot stars has hardly been investigated previously ( see the discussion by @xcite ) .    for their sn ib progenitor models in binary systems ,",
    "@xcite have applied a lower mass loss rate than the nl rate , if @xmath63 during the post mass transfer phase . as a result ,",
    "a small amount of hydrogen is left in many of their sn ib progenitor models , which can be considered as sn iib - b progenitors according to our definition .    to investigate further the effect of wind mass loss",
    ", we made a model grid with a reduced mass loss rate using the scaling factor @xmath64 = 0.48 on the dutch mass loss rate recipe in the mesa code , at solar metallicity ( table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "the mass loss rate with this reduction factor becomes comparable to that of lmc metallicity with the fiducial value of @xmath65 .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab3 ] , this reduction of the mass loss rate gives a result similar to that of the lmc metallicity models .",
    "solutions for sn iib progenitors are found with the sequences with @xmath66 and 13  @xmath0 for @xmath67  d , for which sn ib solutions are obtained with our fiducial mass loss rate . with @xmath68 , solutions for sn iib - b , sn iib - y , and sn iib - r can be found in the order of increasing initial periods . with @xmath69 ,",
    "only sn iib - b is predicted .",
    "this result is also consistent with those of @xcite and @xcite , who found a sn iib - y solution for sn 2011dh and a sn iib - b solution for sn 2008ax , respectively , at solar metallicity .",
    "apparently , these authors did not apply wr mass loss in their binary models .",
    "this consideration should be taken as a caveat when we discuss the metallicity dependence of the predicted sn type ( see section  [ sect : metallicity ] )",
    "a few sn iib progenitors have been directly identified in pre - sn images , including those of sn 1993j , sn 2008ax , sn 2011dh , sn 2013bf and sn 2016gkg  @xcite .",

    "this explains the scatter of the final masses for a given luminosity .",

    "the corresponding initial masses are about 16  @xmath0 for sn 1993j and 13  @xmath0 for sn 2011dh and sn 2013df , in agreement with previous work .",
    "the positions on the hr diagram of our sn iib progenitor models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] . given the limited number of our models , this figure can not properly reflect the real population of sn iib progenitors .",

    "[ fig : result ] . for @xmath72 , which corresponds to @xmath73 solutions for sn iib - b and sn iib - y can be obtained only with lmc metallicity or with a reduced mass loss rate ( @xmath74 ) at solar metallicity .",

    "the host galaxies of sn 2011dh and sn 2016gkg ( m51 and ngc 613 , respectively ) , for which the progenitors belong to sn iib - b or sn iib - y type , are not particularly metal poor .",
    "this might imply a lower mass loss rate from the progenitors than the fiducial mass loss rate adopted in our study  ( cf .",
    "however , the parameter space of our models is limited to stable mass transfer systems .",
    "in reality , multiple binary channels may exist ( e.g. , common envelope ejection ) for sn iib - b / iib - y progenitors , and this issue deserves a more detailed future study .",
    "[ fig : hr ] also shows the v - band magnitudes of our sn iib progenitor models , which were calculated with the black - body approximation .",

    "therefore , it is not surprising that sn iib progenitors have be more commonly identified than sn ib / ic progenitors so far  ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) , despite the fact that the sn ib event rate is comparable to the sn iib rate  ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "note also that the optical brightness of sn iib progenitors gradually decreases as the surface temperature increases for @xmath79 .",

    "sn iib - b progenitors with @xmath80 have @xmath81 and would be relatively difficult to detect in pre - sn images , compared to sn iib - y and iib - r progenitors .",
    "one of the dominant factors that determine the final size and surface temperature of a sn iib progenitor is the hydrogen envelope mass ( @xmath82 ) at the pre - sn stage .",

    "this is because stronger wind mass loss from a more massive progenitor tends to make the orbit wider than the corresponding case with a less massive progenitor .",
    "whether or not the roche lobe filling envelope at the pre - sn stage can explain some features of polarization during an early sn epoch is an important subject of future work .",

    "this leads to the following counter - intuitive result that was also discussed by @xcite in more detail : the brightness in the optical increases as the progenitor mass decreases , while the bolometric luminosity behaves in the opposite way .",

    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : result ] , the parameter space for sn ib progenitors broadens as the metallicity increases . this is because strong winds at a high metallicity during the post mass transfer phase can completely remove the remaining hydrogen layer , for sufficiently short initial orbits .",

    "this prediction seems to be supported by recent analyses on sn host galaxies  ( see figs . a1 and a2 of @xcite ; cf.@xcite ) , but observational studies still suffer from low - statistics on sne from metal poor environments .",
    "the recent analysis on sn iip by @xcite indicates that most sn events occur at around solar metallicity .",

    "<S> we explore properties of type ib and iib sn progenitors that are produced by stable mass transfer in binary systems , using a new grid of stellar evolution models from an initial primary mass in the range of 10 - 18  @xmath0 at solar and large magellanic cloud metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that blue and yellow supergiant sn iib progenitors ( e.g. , of sn 2008ax , sn 2011dh , sn 2016gkg ) have a hydrogen envelope mass less than about 0.15  @xmath0 , mostly resulting from early case b mass transfer with relatively low initial masses and/or low metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> red supergiant ( rsg ) sn iib progenitors ( e.g. , of sn 1993j , sn 2013df ) are produced via late case b mass transfer and have a more massive hydrogen envelope ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> sn ib progenitors are predominantly produced by early case b mass transfer . </S>",
    "<S> our models predict that sn iib progenitors are systematically more luminous in the optical ( @xmath2 ) than the majority of sn ib progenitors ( @xmath3 ) for our considered initial mass range . </S>",
    "<S> however , the optically bright progenitor of sn ib iptf13bvn ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) can be well explained by a relatively low - mass progenitor with a final mass of @xmath5 . the event rate of blue and yellow sn iib progenitors would increase as metallicity decreases , while the event rate of sn ib progenitors would decrease instead . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the population of rsg sn iib progenitors would not be significantly affected by metallicity . </S>"
