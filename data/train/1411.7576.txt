    "the cms detector , a general - purpose apparatus operating at the cern lhc , is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .    concerning the threshold analysis ( inclusive mass range of 0.5 - 2 tev in @xmath4 ) , standard reconstruction techniques for top quarks produced with a small boost (",
    "all decay products are resolved ) are used .",
    "the data analysed are recorded with triggers requiring one isolated lepton and 3 central jets .",
    "the following selection is applied : exactly one isolated lepton , at least 4 jets with @xmath5 , @xmath6 20 gev to reduce qcd background and at least one b - tagged jet .",
    "events are classified into 4 categories according to the flavour of the lepton and the number of b - tagged jets ( exactly one or two and more ) .    for the boosted analysis ( inclusive mass range of 1 - 3 tev in @xmath4 ) ,",
    "techniques dedicated to boosted top quarks reconstruction are used .",
    "the data analysed are recorded with triggers requiring one lepton and 2 central jets . for the selection , exactly one lepton without any isolation specification and",
    "at least 2 jets with @xmath7 150 gev for the leading jet and @xmath7 50 gev for the subsequent jets are required .",
    "@xmath8 has to be greater than 50 gev to reduce qcd background , and the scalar quantity @xmath9 greater than 150 gev . to reduce qcd background , especially in electron channel ,",
    "several topological requirements are applied to ensure the missing transverse momentum does not point along the transverse direction of the electron or of the leading jet .",
    "events are classified into 4 categories according to the flavour of the lepton and the number of b - tagged jets ( exactly zero or one and more ) .",
    "a first step consists in assigning the final - state objects in each event to either the leptonic or hadronic side of the @xmath0 decay . the charged lepton and @xmath10",
    "are assigned to the leptonic side of the event , where @xmath10 is assigned to the transverse component of the neutrino s momentum .",
    "after that , a @xmath11 sorting algorithm is used to assign the jets .    in the threshold analysis ,",
    "the @xmath11 is defined as follows : @xmath12 @xmath13 is the mass of the leptonic top quark ; @xmath14 , the mass of the hadronic top quark ; @xmath15 , the mass of the hadronic w boson and @xmath16 , the transverse momentum of the @xmath0 system .",
    "the choice of the best jets combination corresponds to the one which gives the smallest @xmath11 value .    in the boosted analysis , the @xmath11",
    "is reduced at its two first terms .",
    "all mass hypotheses that have exactly one jet assigned to the leptonic side , and at least one jet assigned to the hadronic side are then considered . the combination with the smallest value of @xmath11 is chosen for each event .",
    "this @xmath11 has to be smaller than 10 which rejects most of the w+jet background and maximizes the sensitivity on the expected limits .",
