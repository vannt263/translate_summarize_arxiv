    "neurons in primary visual cortex show a large increase in input conductance during visual activation : _ in vivo _ recordings ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) show that the conductance can rise to more than three times that of the resting state .",
    "such _ high conductance states _ lead to faster neuronal dynamics than would be expected from the value of the passive membrane time constant , as pointed out by shelley et al .",
    "we use mean field theory to study the firing statistics of a model network with balanced excitation and inhibition and observe consistently such high conductance states during stimulation .    in our study , we classify the irregularity of firing with the fano factor @xmath0 , defined as the ratio of the variance of the spike count to its mean . for",
    "temporally uncorrelated spike trains ( i.e. , poisson processes ) @xmath1 , while @xmath2 indicates a tendency for spike clustering ( bursts ) , and @xmath3 points to more regular firing with well separated spikes .",
    "observed fano factors for spike trains of primary cortical neurons during stimulation are usually greater than 1 and vary within an entire order of magnitude ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we find the same dynamics in our model and are able to pin - point the relevant mechanisms : synaptic filtering leads to spike clustering in states of high conductance ( thus @xmath2 ) , and fano factors depend sensitively on variations in both threshold and synaptic time constants .",
    "we investigate a cortical network model that exhibits self - consistently balanced excitation and inhibition .",
    "the model consists of two populations of neurons , an excitatory and an inhibitory one , with dilute random connectivity .",
    "the model neurons are governed by leaky integrate - and - fire subthreshold dynamics with conductance - based synapses .",
    "the membrane potential of neuron @xmath4 in population @xmath5 ( @xmath6 for excitatory and inhibitory , respectively ) obeys    @xmath7    the first sum runs over all populations @xmath8 , including the excitatory input population representing input from the lgn and indexed by @xmath9 .",
    "the second sum runs over all neurons @xmath10 in population @xmath8 of size @xmath11 .",
    "the reversal potential @xmath12 for the excitatory inputs ( @xmath13 ) is higher than the firing threshold , the one for the inhibitory inputs ( @xmath14 ) is below the reset value .",
    "the constant leakage conductance @xmath15 is the inverse of the membrane time constant @xmath16 .",
    "the time dependent conductance @xmath17 from neuron @xmath10 in population @xmath8 to neuron @xmath4 in population @xmath5 is taken as @xmath18 if there is a connection between those two neurons , otherwise zero .",
    "the sum runs over all spikes @xmath19 emitted by neuron @xmath10 , @xmath20 is the synaptic time constant for the synapse of type @xmath8 ( excitatory or inhibitory ) , and @xmath21 is the heavyside step function .",
    "@xmath22 denotes the average number of presynaptic neurons in population @xmath8 .",
    "we followed van vreeswijk and sompolinsky  @xcite by scaling the conductances with @xmath23 so that their fluctuations are of order one , independent of network size .",
    "we use mean field theory to reduce the full network problem to two neurons : one for each population .",
    "this method is exact in the limit of large populations with homogeneous connection probabilities @xcite .",
    "the neurons receive self - consistent inputs from their cortical environment , exploiting the fact that all neurons within a population exhibit the same firing statistics due to homogeneity .",
    "the time dependent conductance described in ( [ eq : conductance ] ) can then be replaced by a realization of a gaussian distributed random variable @xmath24 with mean @xmath25 and covariance @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is the firing rate of the presynaptic neuron @xmath8 , and @xmath28 is the autocorrelation function of its spike train .",
    "a simple approximation of the autocorrelation , like the one used by  @xcite and  @xcite , is to assume @xmath29 to be temporally uncorrelated ( i.e. , white noise ) , in which case it simplifies to @xmath30 .",
    "the term @xmath31 is a correction for the finite connection concentration @xmath32 and can be derived using the methods of  @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent balance condition is obtained by setting the net current in  ( [ eq : dufull ] ) to zero when the membrane potential is at threshold @xmath33 and the conductances have their mean values  ( [ eq : mean ] ) . in the large @xmath22-limit",
    ", it reads @xmath34    the distribution of the variables @xmath24 can be calculated numerically using an iterative approach  @xcite .",
    "one starts with a guess based on the balance equation  ( [ eq : balance ] ) for the means and covariances and generates a large sample of specific realizations of @xmath29 , which are used to integrate ( [ eq : dufull ] ) to generate a large sample of spike trains .",
    "the latter can then be used to calculate new estimates of the means and covariances by applying ( [ eq : mean ] ) and ( [ eq : covar ] ) and correction of the initial guess towards the new values .",
    "these steps are repeated until convergence .",
    "for the above described model , we chose parameters corresponding to population sizes of 16,000 excitatory neurons and 4,000 inhibitory neurons , representing a small patch of layer iv cat visual cortex .",
    "the neurons were connected randomly , with 10% connection probability between any two neurons .",
    "the firing threshold was fixed to 1 , excitatory and inhibitory reversal potentials were set to @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , and the membrane time constant @xmath37 was @xmath38  ms . for the results presented here , the integration time step was 0.5 ms .",
    "figure  [ fig : autocorr ] illustrates the importance of coloring the noise produced by intra - cortical activity .",
    "the white noise approximation underestimates both the correlation times and the strength of the correlations in the neuron s firing : its autocorrelation ( blue ) is both narrower and weaker than the one for colored noise ( red ) .",
    "fano factors vary systematically with both the distance between reset and threshold and the synaptic time constant @xmath39 .",
    "non - zero synaptic time constants produced consistently fano factors greater than one .",
    "we varied the reset between 0.8 and 0.94 and @xmath39 between 0 and 6  ms , which resulted in values for @xmath0 that span an entire order of magnitude , from slightly above 1 to approximately 10 for @xmath40  ms ( see figure  [ fig : fanos ] ) .    .",
    "longer synaptic time constants lead to increased clustering ( bursts ) of spikes , which is reflected in higher fano factors.,width=514,height=340 ]",
    "in all our simulations , we observed that the membrane potential changed on a considerably faster time scale than the membrane time constant @xmath41  ms .",
    "this behavior is only observed if conductance - based synapses are included in the integrate - and - fire neuron model . to understand this phenomenon , it is convenient to follow the notation of shelley et al .",

    "@xmath43 , and the _ effective reversal potential _ @xmath44 .",
    "the membrane potential @xmath45 follows the effective reversal potential with the input dependent _ effective membrane time constant _ @xmath46 .",
    "the effective reversal potential changes on the time scale of the synaptic time constants , which are up to five times shorter than @xmath16 in our simulations . however , if the effective membrane time constant is shorter than the synaptic time constant due to a large enough total conductance , then @xmath45 can follow @xmath47 closely , as observed in our simulations ( see figure  [ fig : vvs ] ) .",
    "( red ) follows the effective reversal potential @xmath47 ( blue ) closely , except for detours when the neuron is reset due to firing .",
    "the membrane potential recovers fast enough to spike several times while @xmath47 stays above threshold , thus producing bursts of spikes . here , the threshold is set to 1 and the reset to 0.94.,width=514,height=340 ]    in high conductance states , the firing statistics are strongly influenced by synaptic dynamics ( see figure  [ fig : fanos ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast with strictly current based models , where the neuron reacts too slow to reflect fast synaptic dynamics in its firing .",
    "the ` synaptic filtering ' of arriving spikes leads to temporal correlations in @xmath47 and thus to temporal correlations ( by way of spike clustering ) in firing .",
    "therefore , the model neurons receive temporally correlated input rather than white noise . for this reason , in mean field models dealing with conductance based dynamics ,",
    "coloring the noise is important to arrive at the full amount of temporal correlation in firing statistics ( see figure  [ fig : autocorr ] ) .",
    "we confirmed these considerations by running simulations without synaptic filtering ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "as expected , intra - cortical activity became uncorrelated and the white noise approximation produced the same result as coloring the noise correctly .",
    "in that case , fano factors stayed close to 1 ( see figure  [ fig : fanos ] ) , i.e , no tendency of spike clustering was observed .",
    "previous investigations showed that varying the distance between threshold and reset in balanced integrate - and - fire networks has a strong effect on the irregularity of the firing  @xcite . by including a conductance - based description of synapses ,",
    "we were now able to show the importance of synaptic time constants on firing statistics , even if they are several times smaller than the passive membrane time constant : synaptic filtering facilitates clustering of spikes in states of high conductance ."
