    "the parametrically driven damped nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , @xmath0 was used to model the nonlinear faraday resonance in a vertically oscillating water tank @xcite and the effect of phase - sensitive parametric amplifiers on solitons in optical fibers @xcite .",
    "the same equation describes an easy - plane ferromagnet with a combination of a static and hf field in the easy plane @xcite , and the planar weakly anisotropic @xmath1 model @xcite .",
    "it also serves as a continuum limit for the parametrically driven frenkel - kontorova chain ( an array of diffusively coupled pendula ) .",
    "the frenkel - kontorova system is regarded as a fairly realistic model of a number of physical and biological systems and phenomena , including ladder networks of discrete josephson junctions , charge - density - wave conductors , crystal dislocations in metals , dna dynamics and proton conductivity in hydrogen - bonded chains @xcite .",
    "the undamped undriven nonlinear schrdinger equation exhibits soliton solutions which can travel with arbitrary velocity and transport physical characteristics such as mass , momentum and energy .",
    "( for the sake of brevity , we are making use of the hydrodynamical interpretation of the equation here . ) in equation ( [ nls ] ) , the second term in the right - hand side accounts for dissipative losses which occur in all physical systems .",
    "the dissipation has two visible effects on the soliton : it attenuates its speed and damps its amplitude . the main purpose of the introduction of the pumping ( represented by the first term in the right - hand side ) is to compensate for these losses .",
    "the parametric forcing is well known to be capable of counterbalancing the damping of the quiescent soliton s amplitude ; a natural question now is whether it can sustain its motion with a nonzero velocity .",
    "in fact the existence of travelling solitons is a nontrivial matter even in the absence of damping .",
    "the driving term @xmath2 in eq.([nls ] ) breaks the galilean invariance of the unperturbed nonlinear schrdinger equation and hence one can not obtain a moving soliton simply by boosting a static one . however the galilean or lorentz symmetry is not a prerequisite for the existence of moving nonlinear waves .",
    "for example , dissipative systems do not possess any symmetries of this kind but are well known to support stably propagating fronts and pulses whose velocities are determined by parameters of the model",
    ". in particular , travelling domain walls arise in the parametrically - driven ginsburg - landau equations ( where the motion is due to nongradient terms ) @xcite . as far as solitons in hamiltonian systems",
    "are concerned , the example of dark solitons in the nonlinear schrdinger equations suggests that they have even greater mobility than dissipative fronts and pulses .",
    "although in this case the galilean invariance is broken by the presence of the nonvanishing background , the dark solitons can propagate with arbitrary speeds bounded only by the velocity of sound waves @xcite .",
    "a number of nonstationary regimes were reported in the water tank experiments , including the formation of oscillating soliton pairs @xcite , but no steadily moving solitons were detected so far .",
    "on the other hand , numerical simulations of the _ undamped _ parametrically driven nls equation [ eq.([nls ] ) with @xmath3 did exhibit travelling localised objects @xcite .",
    "it has remained an open question whether these moving objects preserve their speed and amplitude , or attenuate and decay slowly due to the emission of the second - harmonic radiation .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the existence of steadily propagating solitons , and examine their stability .",
    "here we are confining ourselves to the undamped situation relegating the analysis of the effect of damping to future publications .",
    "in addition to their role in transport phenomena , stably moving solitons are also of interest as alternative attractors which may compete with ( static or oscillating ) nonpropagating solutions .",
    "we will demonstrate that stable travelling solitons do exist in the parametrically driven nonlinear schrdinger equation . moreover , there are parameter ranges where moving solitons are stable whereas their quiescent counterparts are not .",
    "unstable solitons are not meaningless either ; they arise as long - lived transients and intermediate states in spatio - temporal chaotic regimes . in this paper",
    "we will identify oscillatory and translational instabilities of travelling solitons and simulate their nonlinear evolution near the transition curves .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ prelimi ]",
    "we derive an _ apriori _ bound for the existence domain of travelling solitons and introduce the linearised eigenvalue problem for their stability analysis .",
    "we also discuss some general properties of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and formulate a simple criterion for the onset of the nonoscillatory instability : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the velocity of the steadily moving soliton , and @xmath6 the associated momentum .    in section [ explicit_for_v=0 ] we present several explicit quiescent ( @xmath7 ) solutions , including a stationary complex of two solitons , and then derive the necessary condition for a static solution to be continuable to nonzero velocities .",
    "this condition is that the motionless solution should either not have any  free \" parameters apart from the translational shift , or , if there is an additional parameter @xmath8 , the equation @xmath9 should be satisfied . here",
    "@xmath6 is the momentum of the motionless localised solution ( which , contrary to one s mechanical intuition , is not necessarily equal to zero ) .",
    "there are three static solutions satisfying the above condition , two of which being the well - known constant - phase @xmath10 and @xmath11 solitons , respectively , while the third solution looks like a pulse with a bell - shaped modulus and twisted phase .    the most important results of this work are contained in section [ bif_diagram ] where we report on the numerical continuation of various branches of solutions and their stability analysis .",
    "in agreement with the analytical predictions of the preceding section , we find that each of the above static solutions admits the continuation to nonzero @xmath5 .",
    "the stability properties of travelling solitons result from an intricate interplay of two types of instability , the oscillatory and translational instability . in accordance with the conclusions of section [ prelimi ] ,",
    "the numerical analysis of the linearised eigenvalues shows that the transition curves of the translational instability satisfy @xmath4 .",
    "one interesting conclusion of the stability analysis is that although _ quiescent _ solitons are unstable for driving strengths larger than @xmath12 , there are stable _ moving _ solitons for any @xmath13 .",
    "we discuss in detail the soliton s transformation as it is continued in @xmath5 , paying special attention to the dynamics of the associated linearised eigenvalues on the complex plane .",
    "two different scenarios of the transformation are identified , one occurring for small @xmath14 and the other one for larger driving strength , and we also describe an interesting cross - over from one to another .",
    "section [ simulations ] is devoted to the direct numerical simulations of the full time - dependent nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "we show that the evolution of both types of the soliton instability leads , as @xmath15 , to the same asymptotic attractors .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] contains concluding remarks and outlines some open problems .",
    "we will confine ourselves to localised travelling waves of the simplest form , @xmath16 . transforming to the moving frame , these correspond to time - independent soliton solutions of the equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "we will search for these static solutions by solving an ordinary differential equation @xmath19 under the vanishing boundary conditions @xmath20 as @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath14 is always taken positive ; negative @xmath14 s can be recovered by the phase transformation @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath23 is a solution , then so is @xmath24 .",
    "next , it is straightforward to notice that if the function @xmath23 describes a soliton travelling with the velocity @xmath5 , the function @xmath25(x ) describes a soliton moving with the velocity @xmath26 . we will try to restrict ourselves to positive @xmath5 s wherever possible ; we will only present negative velocities where this may help visualising how different branches of solutions are connected .",
    "since the soliton moving with the velocity @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 , the above observation tells us that either @xmath28 ( that is , one of the real and imaginary part of the solution is even and the other one odd ) , or there are _ two _ solutions associated with the same @xmath5 . ( here we are not making any difference between solutions which are different just in the overal sign . ) in the latter case the solutions will not exhibit the @xmath28 symmetry .",
    "next , it is easy to show that solitons can not travel faster than a certain limit speed . indeed , as @xmath21 , the soliton s asymptotic tail decays as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 large driving strengths , @xmath31 , are of little interest to us as in this case the zero background , @xmath32 , is unstable with respect to continuous spectrum waves @xcite .",
    "therefore we are not going to discuss this case here . in the complementary region @xmath33 ,",
    "the complex structure of @xmath34 depends on the value of the velocity .",
    "when @xmath35 , there are four real exponents ; for @xmath36 where @xmath37 we have a quadruplet of complex @xmath34 s , and finally , for @xmath38 all four exponents are imaginary .",
    "consequently , there can be no exponentially localised solitons travelling faster than @xmath39 .",
    "physically , @xmath39 represents the minimum phase velocity of linear waves governed by eq.([nls ] ) , and our condition @xmath40 is essentially an exclusion principle ruling out a resonance between solitons and linear waves .    in the undamped case the parametrically driven nls equation ( [ nls_moving ] )",
    "conserves the momentum , @xmath41 and energy : @xmath42 noting that stationary solutions satisfy @xmath43 eq.([e ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath44 containing no derivatives , this formula for energy of stationary solutions has obvious advantages for the numerical implementation .      in this paper",
    "we solve the equation ( [ stationary_nls ] ) numerically and examine the stability of the resulting solutions by studying the associated eigenvalue problem .",
    "this eigenvalue problem arises by assuming a small perturbation of the form @xmath45 substituting into ( [ nls_moving ] ) gives @xmath46 where the hermitean operator @xmath47 has the form @xmath48 the matrix @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 and the column - vector @xmath51 . in eq.([h ] ) @xmath52 is the identity matrix , and we have decomposed the stationary solution as @xmath53 .",
    "for symmetric solutions satisfying @xmath28 eigenvalues will always come in ( @xmath54)-pairs .",
    "this follows from the fact that for these solutions changing @xmath55 in the operator ( [ h ] ) amounts to changing the sign of its off - diagonal elements , and hence if @xmath56 is an eigenfunction associated with an eigenvalue @xmath57 , the column @xmath58 will serve as an eigenfunction associated with an eigenvalue @xmath59 . as far as the _ zero _ eigenvalue is concerned , it will have a twin with the eigenfunction @xmath58 unless its eigenfunction @xmath60 satisfies the symmetry @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .    to complete the discussion of the spectrum structure",
    ", we mention that there are two branches of the continuous spectrum lying on the imaginary axis of @xmath57 : @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "( we are still assuming @xmath33 ) . in the region",
    "@xmath66 which is of interest to us , the continuous spectrum has a gap : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",
    "this gap can harbour discrete eigenvalues representing stable oscillation modes .",
    "the aim of this subsection is to demonstrate that a pair of pure imaginary eigenvalues can collide at @xmath70 and move onto the real axis only at the point where @xmath4 .",
    "this criterion is known in the context of dark solitons of the undriven nonlinear schrdinger equations ; see @xcite,@xcite .",
    "here we simply adapt the proof given in @xcite to the case of the equation with the parametric forcing .",
    "an important assumption that we make here , is that the solution whose stability is being examined , does not have any free parameters apart from the trivial translation parameter , @xmath71 .",
    "first of all we need to make a remark on the integrable case , @xmath72 . in this",
    "case solutions of the ode ( [ stationary_nls ] ) can be obtained from a quiescent soliton of eq.([nls ] ) by a galilei transformation : @xmath73 where @xmath74 . for @xmath72 and any @xmath75",
    ", the linearised operator @xmath47 has four zero eigenvalues associated with two eigenvectors .",
    "one of these eigenvectors originates from the translation symmetry and the other one results from the phase invariance of eq.([stationary_nls ] ) .",
    "the term @xmath2 breaks the phase invariance and hence as @xmath14 is increased from zero , one pair of eigenvalues @xmath76 moves away from the origin on the complex plane .",
    "as @xmath14 and @xmath5 are further varied , a pair of eigenvalues may return to the origin . if the solution of eq.([stationary_nls ] ) at the point of their return is a member of a family parametrised by _ two _ free parameters , we will have , again , four zero eigenvalues with two eigenfunctions .",
    "( the eigenfunctions are simply derivatives of the solution with respect to the free parameters . )",
    "our analysis will not be applicable in this case , and the equality @xmath4 does not have to be valid at the return point .",
    "( we will come across this type of a situation in section [ further_ge_28 ] below .",
    ") however , a more common situation is when the solution at the return point is a member of a _",
    "one_-parameter family .",
    "we will show that in this case the relation @xmath4 does have to be in place .",
    "let us denote @xmath77 the velocity for which the eigenvalue of the operator ( [ ev])-([h ] ) vanishes .",
    "we can develop the solution @xmath78 in powers of @xmath79 : @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "accordingly , the operator @xmath47 expands as @xmath82 .",
    "if the eigenvalue @xmath57 moves from imaginary to the real axis , it is natural to assume that it admits an expansion of the form @xmath83 the associated eigenfunction is then developed as @xmath84 when @xmath85 , we have @xmath86 , i.e. @xmath87 is a null eigenvector at the bifurcation point @xmath88 . since we have assumed that @xmath89 is a member of a",

    "@xmath92 is a column - vector formed by the real and imaginary part of the soliton @xmath93 : @xmath94 .",
    "the prime indicates differentiation with respect to @xmath95 .",
    "next , setting the coefficient of @xmath96 to zero yields @xmath97 comparing this to the equation @xmath98 which arises from the differentiation of eq.([stationary_nls ] ) with respect to @xmath5 , we get @xmath99 ( in the above equations @xmath100 . )",
    "the coefficient of @xmath101 produces @xmath102 which has bounded solutions if the right - hand side is orthogonal to the null eigenvector of @xmath90 : @xmath103 the second term in equation ( [ 100 ] ) is readily shown to vanish  one only needs to expand the identity @xmath104 in @xmath105 .",
    "( the coefficient of @xmath101 gives @xmath106 .",
    "taking the scalar product with @xmath107 yields the required @xmath108 . ) on the other hand , the first term in eq.([100 ] ) is equal to @xmath109 .",
    "consequently , eq.([100 ] ) gives either @xmath4 or @xmath110 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath110 , we will not be able to conclude that @xmath4 at this order of the expansion .",
    "however , the order @xmath111 will then give us @xmath112 , which implies either @xmath4 or @xmath113 .",
    "proceeding by a similar token we will eventually arrive at the equation @xmath4 at some order @xmath114 where @xmath115 is such that @xmath116 .",
    "( alternatively , we will have to conclude that all @xmath117 and hence we are dealing with a symmetry eigenvalue which is equal to zero for all @xmath5 . )    thus a pair of real or pure imaginary eigenvalues of the same magnitude and opposite sign , can only collide for the value of @xmath5 which satisfies @xmath118 . here",
    "we wish to re - emphasise that we have obtained this conclusion under the assumption that the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue is _ not _ increased at the point of collision . a simple example when",
    "this assumption is not valid , is furnished by the case @xmath72 . in this case the momentum corresponding to the soliton ( [ integrable ] ) is given by @xmath119 .",
    "although @xmath6 has a maximum for @xmath120 , the stability properties of the undriven soliton do not change at this point .",
    "the reason is that for each @xmath5 the operator @xmath47 has _ two _ null eigenvectors in this case , and hence we can not make the identification @xmath121 .",
    "( instead , @xmath87 will be a linear combination of _ two _ zero modes . )",
    "consequently , the above proof becomes invalid in this case .",
    "finally , one can easily check that the above result does not really depend on how the eigenvalue @xmath57 expands in powers of @xmath105 .",
    "we assumed that the expansion ( [ ev_expansion ] ) starts with terms of order @xmath96 .",
    "this assumption is natural and supported by the numerical evidence ; however , even if we had postulated the expansion starting with terms of order @xmath122 , @xmath123 or say , @xmath105 , we would have still arrived at the _ same _ necessary condition for the zero crossing : @xmath4 .",
    "in order to continue in @xmath5 it is useful to have some starting solutions for @xmath7 .",

    "we will produce several more explicit solutions of the undamped , parametrically driven nls equation ( [ nls_moving ] ) .",

    "the simplest choice @xmath134 leads to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 solitons ( [ soliton ] ) .",

    "the onset values of the translational instabilities , obtained numerically , were shown to verify the relation @xmath4 predicted by our theoretical analysis . as opposed to the case of the soliton @xmath11 , which undergoes similar transformations for any @xmath14 , the result of the continuation of the @xmath10 has turned out to be sensitive to the value of the driving strength .",
    "we have identified two different transformation scenarios , one occurring for small and the other one for larger @xmath14 , and described an interesting cross - over from one to the other .    in our analysis",
    "we paid a special attention to the trajectories of linearised eigenvalues on the complex plane .",
    "apart from the information on the stability of different branches of solutions , the behaviour of the eigenvalues can give insight into the _ supercritical _ dynamics of solitons , i.e. dynamics beyond the instability threshold @xcite .",
    "the motion of the eigenvalues in the undamped case that we are currently concerned with , allows one to even predict the asymptotic attractors arising when there is a small but nonzero damping in the system @xcite . relegating the corresponding bifurcation analysis to future publications , here we have restricted ourselves to a series of numerical simulations of the time - dependent nls equation ( [ nls ] ) ( with @xmath307 . )",
    "it is worth listing , separately , _",
    "stable _ solutions obtained in this study .",
    "first , the quiescent soliton @xmath11 , which is always unstable with respect to a nonoscillatory mode , stabilizes when travels faster than a certain critical velocity .",
    "the stability boundary satisfies @xmath4 .",
    "second , the quiscent soliton @xmath10 is stable for @xmath335 and loses its stability to an oscillating soliton for @xmath336 .",
    "for nonzero @xmath5 the stability region is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the lower boundary of this region corresponds to the onset of the oscillatory instability while along the upper boundary the soliton becomes unstable with respect to a nonoscillatory mode .",
    "the corresponding critical velocity satisfies @xmath4 .",
    "third , the bound state @xmath290 also displays a region of stability for small @xmath14  see fig.6 .",
    "we conclude this section by pointing out to several open questions . in the first place , it would be interesting to continue the @xmath279-branch in fig.4 .",
    "will this multisoliton complex keep on attaching more solitons on its flanks ?",
    "another  open - ended \" branch ( @xmath289 ) approaches the origin vertically down in fig.4 ( a ) ; it would be interesting to continue this branch as well .",
    "the striking difference between the bifurcation diagrams for @xmath255 ( fig.4 ) and @xmath269 ( fig.6 ) is also worthy of a deeper analysis .",
    "is the bifurcation diagram in fig.6 complete , or there are other multisoliton branches similar to those arising for large @xmath14 ( fig.4 ) ?",
    "the next open question concerns the decaying and growing breather solutions arising as a result of the growth of the instability of steadily travelling solitons .",
    "if the radiations were prevented from re - entering the interval of simulation , would the velocity of the breather decay to zero or approach some nonzero value determined by the initial velocity of the unstable soliton ?",
    "finally , a challenging problem is to find out whether travelling solitons can exist in the presence of damping",
    ". the effect of dissipation will be , of course , to attenuate the soliton .",
    "it is not obvious whether the spatially uniform parametric pumping is capable of compensating this type of losses and sustaining the soliton s steady motion .",
    "it is fitting to note here that the parametrically driven , damped nonlinear schrdinger equation has wide classes of stationary solitons @xcite , some of which may be continuable to nonzero @xmath5 .",
    "we thank dmitry pelinovsky for drawing our attention to ref.@xcite and solution ( [ complex ] ) presented therein .",
    "useful conversations with yuri gaididei are also gratefully acknowledged .",
    "special thanks go to nora alexeeva for providing us with a code for the time - dependent nls equation and for her help with numerics . finally , we are grateful to professor igor puzynin for his continual encouragement and strong administrative support of this project .",
