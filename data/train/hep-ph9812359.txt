    "the simplest building blocks of topological structure are instantons ( @xmath1 ) and anti - instantons ( @xmath2 ) which are well - known explicit solutions of the euclidean field equations in four dimensions  @xcite .",
    "instantons ( @xmath3 ) are widely believed to play an important rle in various _ long - distance _ aspects  @xcite of qcd :    first of all , they may provide a solution of the famous @xmath4 problem  @xcite ( @xmath5 ) , with the corresponding pseudoscalar mass splitting related to the topological susceptibility in the pure gauge theory by the well - known witten - veneziano formula  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a number of authors have attributed a strong connection of instantons with chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite as well as the hadron and glueball spectrum .    however , there are also very important _ short - distance _ implications  @xcite of qcd instantons to which the present report is devoted :    instantons are known to induce certain processes which violate _ chirality _ in accord with the general axial - anomaly relation  @xcite and which are forbidden in conventional perturbation theory . of particular interest in this context",

    "finally ( section  6 ) , we briefly address an interesting class of `` fireball '' events , observed in photoproduction , in the context of instantons and put forward a promising proposal  @xcite on extending our theoretical predictions beyond the regime of strict instanton perturbation theory .",
    "in @xmath3-perturbation theory one expands the relevant green s functions about the known , classical instanton solution @xmath8 instead of the usual ( trivial ) field configuration @xmath9 and obtains a corresponding set of modified feynman rules . like in conventional pqcd",

    "being independent of perturbation theory , such simulations provide `` snapshots '' of the qcd vacuum including all possible non - perturbative features like instantons ( figure  [ lattice - intro ] ) .",
    "let us discuss next , how these lattice results may be exploited to provide crucial support for the theoretical basis of our calculations in dis :    to this end , we first perform a _ quantitative _ confrontation  @xcite of the predictions from @xmath3-perturbation theory with a recent high - quality lattice simulation  @xcite of qcd ( without fermions , @xmath56 ) .",
    "the striking agreement which we shall find over a range of @xmath3-collective coordinates is a very interesting result by itself .",

    "( [ cs ] ) and ( [ saddle ] ) ) that the collective coordinate integrals in our dis cross - section @xmath23 are dominated by a unique , calculable saddle - point ( @xmath57 ) , in one - to - one correspondence to the conjugate momentum variables ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "this fact then allows us to _ translate _ the extracted range of validity of @xmath3-perturbation theory and the dilute @xmath3-gas approximation , ( @xmath59 ) , directly into a `` fiducial '' kinematical region ( @xmath60 ) in momentum space !    in lattice simulations 4d - euclidean space - time is made discrete ; specifically , the recent `` data '' from the ukqcd collaboration  @xcite , which we shall use here , involve a lattice spacing @xmath61 fm and a volume @xmath62\\,a^4 $ ] . in principle , such a lattice allows to study the properties of an ensemble of @xmath3 s and @xmath63 s with sizes @xmath64 .",
    "however , in order to make instanton effects visible , a certain `` cooling '' procedure has to be applied first .",
    "it is designed to filter out ( dominating ) fluctuations of _ short _ wavelength @xmath65 ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ lattice - intro ]  ( a ) ) , while affecting the topological fluctuations of much longer wavelength @xmath66 comparatively little .",
    "after `` cooling '' , @xmath3 s and @xmath63 s can clearly be seen ( and studied ) as bumps in the lagrange density and the topological charge density ( figure  [ lattice - intro ]  ( b ) , ( c ) ) . for a more detailed discussion of lattice - specific caveats , like possible lattice artefacts and the dependence of results on `` cooling '' etc . , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "of course , one has to extrapolate the lattice observables to the continuum ( @xmath67 ) , before a meaningful comparison with @xmath3-perturbation theory can be made .",
    "this is complicated by a strong dependence of the various distributions on the number @xmath68 of cooling sweeps for _ fixed _ @xmath69 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , _",
    "equivalent _ pairs ( @xmath70 ) were found , for which _ shape _ and _ normalization _ of the distributions essentially remain _",

    "here , @xmath75 denotes the continuum limit of the _ weakly varying _",
    "average @xmath47 values , @xmath76 , of @xmath77 . a _ linear _ extrapolation in @xmath78 was employed . for consistency and minimization of uncertainties , one should use only a single dimensionful quantity to relate lattice units and physical units . throughout our analysis ,",
    "all dimensions are therefore expressed by the so - called sommer scale  @xcite @xmath79 , with @xmath80 fm , which we prefer over the string tension  @xcite .",

    "let us concentrate here on the ( @xmath71)-density @xmath81 .",
    "the prediction ( [ dens ] ) of @xmath3-perturbation theory is a power law for _ small _ @xmath47 , i.e. approximately @xmath82 for @xmath56 . due to its 2-loop rg",
    "- invariance the normalization of @xmath81 is practically independent of the renormalization scale @xmath34 over a wide range .",

    "we display both this parameter - free prediction from ( [ dens ] ) of @xmath3-perturbation theory and the continuum limit of the ukqcd data in a log - log plot , to clearly exhibit the expected power law in @xmath47 .",
    "the agreement in shape _ and _ normalization for @xmath85 fm is striking , indeed , notably in view of the often criticized `` cooling '' procedure and the strong sensitivity to @xmath86 .    by a similar analysis  @xcite",
    ", we were able to infer from the `` equivalent '' ukqcd lattice data a range of validity @xmath87 of the valley expression for the @xmath27-interaction @xmath36 in ( [ cs ] ) .",

    "note also that the cross - section quoted in eq .",
    "( [ minimal - cuts ] ) corresponds to a fraction of @xmath3-induced to normal dis ( ndis ) events of @xmath99 this is remarkably close to the published upper limits on the fraction of @xmath3-induced events  @xcite , which are also on the one percent level .",
    "there are still a number of significant uncertainties in our result for the cross - section . for",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 cuts , one of the dominant uncertainties arises from the experimental uncertainty in the qcd scale @xmath100 . in the 2-loop expression for @xmath10 with @xmath101 ( massless ) flavours we used the value @xmath102 mev , corresponding to the central value of the dis average for @xmath103 , @xmath104 mev  @xcite .",
    "if we change @xmath105 within the allowed range , @xmath106 mev , the cross - section ( [ minimal - cuts ] ) varies between 26 pb and 426 pb .",
    "minor uncertainties are associated with the residual renormalization - scale dependence ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ renorm ] ) and the choice of the factorization scale . upon varying the latter by an order of magnitude , the changes are in the @xmath107 % range only .    by",
    "far the dominant uncertainty in @xmath108 arises , however , from the uncertainty in placing the ( @xmath109 ) cuts ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ cuts ] ) .",
    "hence , the constraints ( [ fiducial ] ) from lattice simulations are extremely valuable for making concrete and reliable predictions of the @xmath3-induced rate at hera .",
    "an indispensable tool for investigating the structure of the @xmath3-induced final state and for developping optimized search strategies is our monte - carlo generator for @xmath3-induced dis - events , qcdins 1.60 . besides the matrix element for the @xmath3-induced hard subprocess",
    ", it provides leading - log parton showers and hadronization via its interface to herwig 5.9 .",
    "the characteristic features of the @xmath3-induced final state are illustrated in figure  [ events ]  ( a ) displaying the lego plot of a typical event from qcdins 1.60 ( c.f . also figure  [ ev - displ ] ) :    besides a single ( not very hard ) current - quark jet , one expects an accompanying densely populated _",
    "`` hadronic band''_. for @xmath110 , say , it is centered around @xmath111 and has a width of @xmath112 .",
    "the band directly reflects the _ isotropic _ production of an @xmath3-induced `` fireball '' of @xmath113 partons in the @xmath3-rest system .",
    "both the total transverse energy @xmath114 gev and the charged particle multiplicity @xmath115 in the band are far higher than in normal dis events .",
    "finally , each @xmath3-induced event has to contain strangeness ( and possibly also charm ) such that the number of @xmath116 s amounts to @xmath117/event .    despite the high expected rate ( [ minimal - cuts ] ) of @xmath3-induced events at hera ,",
    "no _ single _ observable is known ( yet ) with sufficient ndis rejection .",
    "hence , a dedicated multi - observable analysis seems to be required .",
    "neural network filters are being tried and exhibit a very good analyzing power if applied to @xmath118 observables  @xcite .",
    "strategies to produce `` instanton - enriched '' data samples and to reconstruct ( @xmath119 ) are under study and look quite promising  @xcite . clearly , in all cases , a good understanding of the perturbative qcd background in the _ tails _ of the considered distributions is required .",
    "a class of striking `` fireball '' events in photoproduction , with large total @xmath120 and large multiplicity , has been reported  @xcite at this meeting ( see e.g. figure  [ events ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "while the quantitative analysis is still in an early stage , these events seem to exhibit all characteristics of @xmath3-induced events ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ events ]  ( a ) ) .",
    "however , it appears that  unlike ordinary qcd perturbation theory  the hard photoproduction limit , @xmath121 large , is not within the reach of strict @xmath3-perturbation theory .",
    "the reason is that in the @xmath122 limit , we encounter a contribution to the photoproduction cross - section , which tends to _ diverge _ , if integrated over the @xmath3-size @xmath47 .",
    "this ir divergence at large @xmath47 is independent of the @xmath120 of the ( current quark ) jet and directly associated with the `` bad ''",
    "large-@xmath47 behaviour of the _ perturbative _ expression ( [ dens ] ) for the @xmath3-density , @xmath123 .",
    "in contrast , the _ actual _ form of @xmath51 ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ lattice ] ) is strongly peaked around @xmath124 fm , and appears to _ vanish _ exponentially fast for larger @xmath47 .",
    "the above `` fireball '' events and more generally , the ongoing @xmath3-searches at hera , provide plenty of motivation for trying to extend our calculational framework beyond strict @xmath3-perturbation theory . we are thus led to make the following promising proposal in this direction :    one may try and replace the most strongly varying entries in the perturbative calculations , the @xmath3-density @xmath51 and the @xmath27-interaction @xmath36 , in ( [ cs ] ) , by their _ actual _ form as extracted from the recent non - perturbative lattice results  @xcite .    the @xmath3-rates in photoproduction and the @xmath3-contributions to further interesting observables may then be calculated , and the ( @xmath125 ) cuts in @xmath3-searches be considerably relaxed ! due to the strong peaking of @xmath51 , only the region around @xmath124 fm enters and the dilute - gas approximation may well continue to hold up to the peak ( c.f . section  3 ) .",
