    "many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) give rise to the appearance of charged scalar particles .",
    "the discovery of a charged scalar at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) would therefore be a clear sign of new physics .",
    "searches for a charged scalar with a mass below the top - quark mass are being performed by the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations in the process @xmath1 with one of the top - quark decaying to a charged scalar and and a b - quark .",
    "so far , no evidence for the existence of a charged scalar has been found .",
    "hence , limits have been set on @xmath2 .",
    "this result constrains in turn the parameter space of models with charged higgs scalars like for instance the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) or two - higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) .",
    "previous searches for charged higgs at the large electron positron ( lep ) collider have set a lower limit on the mass of the charged higgs boson of 80 gev at 95% c.l .",
    ", assuming @xmath3  @xcite with the process @xmath4 . if however @xmath5 , the bound on the mass is 94 gev  @xcite .",
    "other searches for a light charged higgs either have much smaller production rates or depend on the details of the scalar potential of the particular model under study  @xcite . therefore , alternative studies to direct searches are important if one wants to increase the region of parameter space being probed in each model .",
    "these studies are even more useful if they just rely on the yukawa couplings which is the case in this work .",
    "while cross sections and branching ratios are the primary observables providing a test of the theory by means of simple number counting , there can be competing theories which predict the same number of events , possibly for different choices of parameters .",
    "it would be good , in such cases to have further discriminants which characterize the models in more detail .",
    "final - state kinematic distributions can provide such discrimination , when sufficient number of events are available . in case of the production of heavy particles like the top quark",
    ", a further discriminant could be the polarization of the particle , if it can be measured with sufficient accuracy .    with this motivation ,",
    "we analyse the different types of 2hdms and make predictions for top - quark polarization when the charged higgs of the model is produced in association with the top quark at the lhc .",
    "we then examine how this information could be used in the measurement of the charged higgs boson mass , and also discriminating between different types of 2hdms .",
    "we find that in some cases it is possible to use top polarization to measure the charged higgs mass for particularly large values of either left chiral or right chiral yukawa couplings , or alternatively to exclude regions in the mass - coupling parameter space .",
    "the polarization measurement can also resolve , in certain cases , the ambiguity in identifying the charged higgs yukawa couplings of various 2hdms .",
    "similar studies were performed for 2hdms using @xmath6 spin correlations to analyse the charged higgs yukawa couplings in @xmath6 production using the decay @xmath7",
    "@xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the advantages of studying top polarization , as also the procedure for its measurement .",
    "section iii describes both the cp - conserving and the cp - violating 2hdms used as benchmark models together with the corresponding experimental and theoretical constraints .",
    "section iv contains a discussion on the fermion couplings to charged higgs bosons in various 2hdms and how top polarization can be used to measure the charged - higgs mass . in section",
    "v we take up the issue of using top polarization and an azimuthal asymmetry of the charged lepton arising in top decay to distinguish among different 2hdm types .",
    "section vi contains the conclusions .",
    "while the cross section for top production can be used for a test of the production mechanism within a given model , it can often not discriminate between two models which can give the same cross section for some choice of parameters . in such cases , more detailed information like top polarization can be more useful in discriminating models . being a parity violating quantity ,",
    "polarization is a measure of the degree of parity violation .",
    "in particular , chiral couplings lead to parity violation and hence to the polarization of the top - quark .",
    "top pair production at hadron colliders in the sm occurs dominantly through parity - conserving strong interactions . as a result , @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "are produced unpolarized apart from tiny polarizations induced by weak interactions .",
    "thus a measurable polarization in pair production signals contributions of new particles with chiral couplings . in single - top production in association with jets or with a @xmath10 boson or with a charged higgs boson ,",
    "weak interactions contribute to the production process .",
    "these being chiral , top polarization would be non - zero and potentially large . in particular , the @xmath11 coupling to charged higgs in 2hdms is chiral in nature , with the dominant chirality depending on @xmath12 ( defined as the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two doublets ) as well as on the particular model .",
    "it is thus reasonable to presume that a measurement of top polarization in the production of a single top in association with charged higgs bosons can be a good discriminant of the category of the 2hdm for a certain range of parameters .",
    "polarization of the top , unlike that of lighter quarks , is in principle possible to measure because the former decays with a lifetime shorter than the hadronization time .",
    "thus the decay preserves the polarization present at production .",
    "the distribution of the decay products of the top can thus be used to measure the polarization . for a heavy particle , the angular distribution of a particular decay product in the rest frame of the parent",
    "is given by ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the angle between the momentum of the decay product and the spin direction of the parent in the rest frame , @xmath15 is the degree of polarization of the parent , and @xmath16 is the analyzing power corresponding to the particular decay channel .",
    "the angular distribution equation ( [ restpoldist ] ) can be measured to determine the polarization @xmath15 . however",
    ", this requires the rest frame of the decaying particle to be reconstructed , which , as is the case with the top quark , is often not easy and involves loss of efficiency .",
    "thus it would be better to use the angular distribution in the laboratory frame to determine top polarization . in that case",
    ", the angles which can be used without full reconstruction of the top direction would be the polar and azimuthal angles of the decay particle with respect to the the beam axis as @xmath17 axis , and a suitably chosen @xmath18 plane .",
    "we will choose the @xmath18 plane to be the production plane of the top quark , which requires only the determination of the transverse direction of the top quark .",
    "the angular distribution of charged leptons in top decay , apart from having the advantage of being clean as compared to that of jets , is the most sensitive observable because the corresponding analyzing power @xmath16 is maximal , viz . , 1 , at tree level , and receives only small corrections at higher order @xcite .",
    "it has the further advantage that it is independent of anomalous @xmath19 couplings in top decay to linear order in the anomalous couplings @xcite .",
    "it is thus an uncontaminated measure of top polarization .",
    "it must be borne in mind that the quantity which correctly determines the final state distributions is not the polarization , but the spin density matrix .",
    "polarization is the difference in the diagonal elements of the ( normalized ) spin density matrix , whereas the correct decay distribution also requires the inclusion of the off - diagonal matrix elements to preserve coherence effects . in what follows ,",
    "we include the full density matrix for top production as well as decay .",
    "in addition , rather than making a fit to a distribution , it is more convenient to define an angular asymmetry , which is just a number , and compare it with the prediction to determine the polarization .",
    "while a forward - backward polar asymmetry is convenient to use for a @xmath20 collider or an @xmath21 collider , it vanishes in the case of a @xmath22 collider .",
    "we therefore make use of an azimuthal asymmetry @xmath0 defined by @xmath23    the azimuthal asymmetry was first proposed in @xcite and subsequently studied in further detail as a measure of top polarization in  @xcite . since then it has been used extensively in probing several new physics scenarios  @xcite .",
    "stringent constraints on anomalous @xmath24 couplings in single - top with associated @xmath10 production were obtained in  @xcite .",
    "top polarization as a means of studying cp violation in the same process was proposed in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that strong limits on top chromo - magnetic and chromo - electric couplings could be placed in top pair production utilizing top polarization and @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 for @xmath25 production in type ii 2hdm was proposed in @xcite and shown in  @xcite to be robust under nlo corrections .    here",
    ", we will calculate @xmath0 for different values of parameters @xmath12 and @xmath26 in type i and type ii 2hdms and examine how it can serve to discriminate between different parameters in the same model , and between different models with the same values of the parameters .",
    "many extensions of the scalar sector of the sm give rise to the appearance of charged scalar particles . because these are spin 0 particles their yukawa couplings to the third quark generation have the general form @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are constants that depend on the particular model under study , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the top - quark and the bottom - quark mass , respectively and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the left- and right - helicity projection .",
    "models with scenarios where the dominant term in equation ( [ eq : coup1 ] ) alternates between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , depending on the values of the parameters in the model , were previously studied in the literature .",
    "this is for instance the case of type ii 2hdms recently discussed in  @xcite . in the type ii 2hdm @xmath36 and",
    "therefore the @xmath34 dominates for small values of @xmath37 while the @xmath35 term takes over for large @xmath37 leading to the possibility of a measurement of the @xmath37 parameter .",
    "there are however models where only one of the two terms dominate in which case the dependence on @xmath28 and @xmath29 cancels and the top polarization depends only on the charged higgs mass .",
    "this gives rise to the interesting possibility of measuring the charged higgs mass using top polarization . as a simple realization of this situation",
    "we consider the example of a type i 2hdm where @xmath38 .",
    "further , there are scenarios in models where @xmath39 where however one can easily find regions of the parameter space where @xmath40 . in this case",
    "again the constant dependence drops out and top polarization depends only on the charged higgs mass leading to its indirect measurement .",
    "if indeed a complete agreement between the sm model prediction for the top polarization and its experimental measured value is found a limit on the charged higgs mass can in principle be derived .",
    "we will now briefly describe the 2hdms which will serve here as benchmark models as they allow for the study of the different possibilities regarding the general form of the coupling in equation  ( [ eq : coup1 ] ) .",
    "flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) are extremely constrained by experimental data .",
    "the most general yukawa lagrangian in a model with two higgs doublets gives rise to tree - level higgs - mediated fcncs .",
    "one way to circumvent this problem is to force the higgs potential to be symmetric under a @xmath41 symmetry such that one of the two higgs fields is odd under this symmetry .",
    "the resulting higgs potential can be written as @xmath42 ~ , \\label{higgspot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , @xmath44 are complex su(2 ) doublets with four degrees of freedom each .",
    "hermiticity of the potential forces all parameters except @xmath45 and @xmath46 to be real .",
    "the nature of the vacuum together with the choices for @xmath45 and @xmath46 will dictate weather the model is cp - conserving or cp - violating ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this , in turn , will give rise to different particle spectra : two cp - even higgs states , usually denoted by @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and one cp - odd state , usually denoted by @xmath49 for the cp - conserving case and three neutral states usually denoted by @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the cp - violating potential . as long as electric charge",
    "is not broken  @xcite , the particle spectrum of the 2hdm is completed by two charged higgs boson states , one charged conjugated to the other .",
    "the charged higgs yukawa couplings are almost everything we need from each particular 2hdm yukawa model to perform this particular study .",
    "although neutral scalars could be involved in the process , these will not play a significant role in the analysis .",
    "hence , the discussion is valid for both a cp - conserving and a cp - violating 2hdm where these couplings are the same . the cp - conserving model",
    "( taking all couplings in ( [ higgspot ] ) and vevs real ) and the explicit cp - violating model presented in  @xcite are two such models .",
    "the cp - violating model is built such that the vevs are real and cp is explicitly broken by taking @xmath45 and @xmath46 to be complex .",
    "the usual definition of @xmath53 can be kept because the vevs are real in these two cp versions of the model . extending the @xmath41 symmetry to the yukawa sector",
    "originates the four possible models type i , type ii , type y ( flipped ) and type x ( lepton - specific )  @xcite , whose @xmath54 couplings to fermions are presented in table  [ tab : yuk ] .    .charged higgs yukawa couplings to up- , down - type quarks and leptons .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are the left- and right - helicity projection operators , respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in our study we have imposed the most recent bounds on @xmath37 and on the charged higgs mass  @xcite .",
    "these bounds lead us to take @xmath55 gev and @xmath56 for types i and x. for model type ii the bound on the charged higgs mass in now @xmath57 gev .",
    "however , we also present results for model type ii , where the bounds on the charged higgs mass can be evaded due to cancellations in the loop contributions from other sources of new physics .",
    "this partial cancellation of the charged higgs loop with the chargino loop occurs in the mssm in the contribution to @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "the bound @xmath57 gev also applies to model y and in this case also the branching ratio @xmath59 is suppressed relative to all other types .",
    "as we will show later our analysis rely very much on a large @xmath59 which leads us to discard model type y from our analysis .",
    "as previously mentioned , we are considering the associated production of a charged higgs boson with a top - quark , @xmath60 which proceeds at leading order via @xmath61 . before discussing the different scenarios we should make clear that all results presented in this work are for @xmath62 - the addition of @xmath63 amounts to an increase in significance by a factor of @xmath64 .",
    "there are two main scenarios to consider - the charged higgs boson mass either below ( light ) or above ( heavy ) the top - quark mass . for a light charged higgs",
    "we have the competition from @xmath1 regarding the total number of charged higgs being produced .",
    "however , since the latter is mainly a qcd process , its contribution to the top polarization and to the asymmetries is negligible .",
    "nevertheless , in order to make meaningful predictions , @xmath1 has to be considered as background to the process under study because it contributes to the total number of charged higgs produced .",

    "the parameter @xmath45 plays no role in the analysis .",
    "we conclude that for type i this branching ratio vanishes as soon as the @xmath73 channel opens . for models ii and x",
    "it is clear that large values of @xmath72 are possible for charged higgs masses well above the top mass and that it grows with @xmath37 .",
    "we note that for a charged higgs mass of for instance 160 gev , the @xmath72 is already above 90 % for @xmath74 in models type ii and x while it has a constant value close to 70 % for type i. if all other higgs are heavy and @xmath75 , then the most important decay channel for the heavy charged higgs boson is @xmath73 .",
    "this would lead to a @xmath76 final state for which a dedicated analysis would have to be performed .",
    "therefore our discussion will focus mainly on charged higgs with masses below 250 gev .",

    "the only difference between type i and type x is the value of @xmath72 which is slightly smaller in type i. the behaviour of @xmath117 is shown in figure  [ fig : cs - mh160 ] for @xmath79 tev and @xmath118 gev for type x , type i and type ii 2hdms . it is clear that the number of events one would expect for @xmath37 below 5 is very similar in models ii and x and not very far away from what is expected for type i also .",
    "hence , we will now check if top polarization and @xmath0 can be used to distinguish between the models .     for @xmath79 tev and @xmath118 gev for type x ,",
    "type i and type ii 2hdms.,width=336 ]     tev and @xmath65 for type x and type ii 2hdms .",
    "the bands represent statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature ( 10 % systematic errors were assumed ) .",
    "right panel : same plot but for @xmath0,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]   tev and @xmath65 for type x and type ii 2hdms .",
    "the bands represent statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature ( 10 % systematic errors were assumed ) .",
    "right panel : same plot but for @xmath0,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    in the left panel of figure  [ fig : pt1 ] we present top polarization as a function of the charged higgs mass for @xmath119 tev and @xmath65 for type x and type ii 2hdms .",
    "the bands represent statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature ( 10 % systematic errors were assumed ) .",
    "it is clear that even when all errors are considered , the bands do not intersect for a charged higgs mass between 100 and 250 gev . hence , the models are clearly distinguishable for light charged higgs and for a narrow range of @xmath37 . in the right panel",
    "we have plotted the azimuthal asymmetry , @xmath0 , as a function of the charged higgs mass for the same value of @xmath37 . in this case only very light charged higgs would allow to tell one model from the other .",
    "this measurement has however the advantage of not requiring the experimental reconstruction of the top quark .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pt2 ] we have plotted the top polarization for two different scenarios regarding the @xmath83 of the reconstructed top quark . in the left panel we only kept the events with a top transverse momentum above 100 gev while in the right panel we kept the events with a @xmath83 below 100 gev .",
    "it is obvious that a lower bound in the top quark @xmath83 does not change the general trend previously observed with no cuts . on the contrary ,",
    "the central values of the top polarization for each model are displaced to lower values but the intersection occurs for a slightly larger value of the charged higgs mass .",
    "this shows that @xmath83 , along with our kinematic variables , can be used to maximise the chances of distinguishing between models .",
    "tev and @xmath65 for type x and type ii 2hdms with a transverse momentum cut on the top quark of 100 gev .",
    "the bands represent statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature ( 10 % systematic errors were assumed ) .",
    "right panel : same plot but now only events with a top quark @xmath83 below 100 gev were considered.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]   tev and @xmath65 for type x and type ii 2hdms with a transverse momentum cut on the top quark of 100 gev .",
    "the bands represent statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature ( 10 % systematic errors were assumed ) .",
    "right panel : same plot but now only events with a top quark @xmath83 below 100 gev were considered.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]",
    "we have investigated in detail various scenarios of 2hdms where top polarization can play a role in the determination of the mass as well as the yukawa couplings of the charged higgs boson at the lhc in the process of single top production in association with a charged higgs .",
    "being a parity - odd observable , polarization can play a significant role in processes where the yukawa couplings have a particular dominant chirality .",
    "we have shown that top polarization and the azimuthal asymmetry , @xmath0 can be used to measure the mass of a charged higgs boson in particular regions of the model s parameter space .",
    "if a charged higgs is not found these observables can help to constrain the parameter space of the model .",
    "in particular , for type ii 2hdm , measurement of polarization and @xmath0 can provide information on the charged - higgs mass with a fair degree of accuracy for values of @xmath12 less than about 3 , or greater than about 30 .",
    "for type i and type x models , the only accessible region is the very low @xmath12 region - as the cross section decreases steeply with @xmath37 , the statistical errors become quite large for the higher values of @xmath12 .",
    "model y , with its low branching ratio @xmath120 , does not lead to sufficient number of events for mass determination , and was dropped from the analysis .",
    "however it is clear that our variables can be used to exclude regions of parameter space of the type ii models .",
    "there are scenarios where several models give rise to the same prediction regarding the number of events with charged higgs bosons .",
    "we have shown that if a charged higgs boson is discovered at the lhc , the observables @xmath87 and @xmath0 are a tool to characterise the charged higgs yukawa couplings and therefore to help to identify the underlying model . in 2hdms",
    "this situation occurs for the low @xmath37 region but the method can be used for any models where the terms corresponding to left and right chirality are different .",
    "in our analysis we have assumed presently allowed values of the 2hdm parameters .",
    "we have compared our exclusion plot for the 8 tev run and 20 fb@xmath80 of integrated luminosity with the ones presented by the atlas and cms collaborations based on @xmath1 with one of the top quarks decaying into a charged higgs and a b - quark .",
    "we concluded that our results could be competitive with theirs in the charged higgs mass region above about 150 gev .",
    "finally we have repeated the analysis for integrated luminosities in the range of 30 to 300 fb@xmath80 at a future lhc run at 13 gev .",
    "we found that it should be possible to observe or rule out parameter space in some 2hdms scenarios from lhc data in the coming years .",
