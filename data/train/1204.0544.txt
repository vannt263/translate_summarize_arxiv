    "dengue is a disease which is now endemic in africa , america , asia , and the western pacific . in europe",
    "there has been no registered cases so far , yet the main vector of the disease is already present there and has been followed in madeira . according to the world health organization @xcite , the incidence of dengue has grown drastically in the last decades and roughly two fifths of the world population is now at risk .",
    "so far , the strategies to control _ aedes aegypti _ mosquito proved to be inefficient and the continuous level of surveillance of the mosquito is low .",
    "climatic changes , unsanitary habitat , poverty , uncontrolled urbanization , and global travel favor the propagation of dengue fever .",
    "inadequate water supply requires large - scale water storages , which are ideal breeding habitats for mosquitoes .",
    "the increasing movement of people and goods has enabled the dengue virus and its vectors to spread to new parts of the world @xcite .",
    "there is no effective vector control and dengue infection rates have been increasing during the last 40 years , , in thailand has increased from 9/100,000 in 1958 to 189/100,000 in 1998 @xcite .",
    "the virus emerged for the first time in cape verde at the end of september 2009 .",
    "the outbreak was the biggest ever recorded in africa .",
    "as the population had never had contact with the virus , herd immunity was very low .",
    "dengue type 3 spread throughout four of the nine islands .",
    "the worst outbreak occurred on the island of santiago , where most people live , up to 1000 cases per day in november .",
    "the ministry of health of cape verde reported over 20,000 cases of dengue fever , which is about 5% of the total population of the country , between october and december 2009 . from 173 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever",
    "reported , six people died @xcite .",
    "dengue is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes , mainly _ aedes aegypti _ , and exists either as _ dengue fever _ ( df ) or as _ dengue hemorrhagic fever _ ( dhf ) . the disease can be contracted by one of four types of viruses . infection with one serotype confers lifetime immunity against that serotype , but not to the others , and there is evidence that a prior infection increases the risk of developing dhf for people infected with another serotype .",
    "df is characterized by sudden high fever ( 3 to 7 days ) without respiratory symptoms , intense headache , and painful joints and muscles .",
    "the haemorrhagic form is also characterized by sudden fever , nausea , vomiting , and fainting due to low blood pressure by fluid leakage .",
    "it usually lasts between two and three days and can lead to death .",
    "there is no specific effective treatment for dengue .",
    "fluid replacement therapy is used if clinical diagnosis is made early .",
    "vaccine candidates are undergoing clinical trials @xcite .",
    "_ aedes aegypti _ is closely associated with humans and their dwellings , thriving in crowded cities and biting primarily during day light .",
    "humans also provide nutrients needed for mosquitoes to reproduce through water - holding containers , in and around human homes . in urban areas ,",
    "_ aedes _ mosquitoes breed on water collections in artificial containers such as plastic cups , used tires , broken bottles , and flower pots . with urbanization , crowded cities , poor sanitation , and lack of hygiene ,",
    "environmental conditions foster the spread of the disease which , even in the absence of fatal forms , breeds significant economic and social costs ( absenteeism , immobilization , debilitation , and medication ) @xcite .",
    "female mosquitoes acquire infection by taking a blood meal from an infected human .",
    "these infected mosquitoes pass the disease to susceptible humans .",
    "female mosquitoes lay their eggs on inner wet walls of containers .",
    "larvae hatch when water inundates eggs . in the following days , the larvae feed on microorganisms and particulate organic matter .",
    "when the larva has acquired enough energy and size , metamorphosis changes the larva into a pupa .",
    "pupae do not feed : they just change in form until the adult body , the fling mosquito , is formed . the newly formed adult emerges from the water after breaking the pupal skin .",
    "the entire life cycle , from the aquatic phase ( eggs , larvae , pupae ) to the adult phase , lasts from 8 to 10 days at room temperature , depending on the level of feeding @xcite .",
    "it is very difficult to control or eliminate _",
    "aedes aegypti _ mosquitoes because they quickly adapt to changes in the environment and they quickly pullulate again after droughts or prophylactic measures .",
    "the transmission thresholds and the extent of dengue transmission are determined by the level of herd immunity in the human population to circulating virus serotype(s ) , virulence characteristics of the viral strain , survival , feeding behavior , abundance of _ aedes aegypti _ , climate and human density , distribution , and movement @xcite .",
    "there are two primary preventions : larval control and adult mosquito control , depending on the intended target @xcite .",
    "larvicide treatment is an effective control of the vector larvae , together with mechanical control , which is related to educational campaigns to remove still water from domestic recipients and eliminating possible breeding sites .",
    "the larvicide should be long - lasting and preferably have world health organization clearance for use in drinking water @xcite .",
    "the application of adulticides can drop the mosquito vector population .",
    "however , the efficacy is often constrained by the difficulty in achieving sufficiently high coverage of resting surfaces @xcite .    while @xcite investigate the competitive exclusion principle in a two - strain dengue model , @xcite estimate the basic reproduction number for dengue using spatial epidemic data .",
    "@xcite , established the global asymptotic stability of the equilibria of a single - strain dengue model . @xcite",
    "introduce a sterile insect technique .",
    "we adapt the model presented in @xcite and @xcite to dengue , with the considerations of @xcite .",
    "we consider three controls simultaneously : larvicide , adulticide , and mechanical control , with mutually - exclusive compartments , to study the outbreak of 2009 in cape verde and improve upon @xcite .",
    "we denote @xmath0 the total number of susceptible , @xmath1 the total number of infected and infectious , and @xmath2 the total number of resistant individuals .",
    "the total human population is a constant @xmath3 .",
    "the population is homogeneous , which means that every individual of a compartment is homogeneously mixed with the other individuals .",
    "immigration and emigration are ignored .",
    "female mosquitoes are in total number @xmath4 in the aquatic phase ( including egg , larva , and pupa stages ) , @xmath5 are susceptible , and @xmath6 are infected .",
    "mosquitoes are considered to live too briefly to develop resistance .",
    "each mosquito has an equal probability to bite any host .",
    "humans and mosquitoes are assumed to be born susceptible .",
    "we consider three controls : the proportion @xmath7 of larvicide , the proportion @xmath8 of adulticide , and the proportion @xmath9 of mechanical control .",
    "larval control targets the immature mosquitoes living in water before they bite .",
    "the natural soil bacterium _ bacillus thuringiensis israelensis _ ( bti ) is sprayed from the ground or by air to larval habitats .",
    "the control of adult mosquitoes is necessary when mosquito populations can not be treated in their larval stage .",
    "depending upon the size of the area , either trucks for ground adulticide treatments or aircraft for aerial adulticide treatments are used .",
    "the purpose of mechanical control is to reduce larval habitat areas .",
    "the parameters used in the model are :    @xmath10 total population ;    @xmath11 average daily biting ( per day ) ;    @xmath12 transmission probability from @xmath6 ( per bite ) ;    @xmath13 transmission probability from @xmath1 ( per bite ) ;    @xmath14 average lifespan of humans ( in days ) ;    @xmath15 mean viremic period ( in days ) ;    @xmath16 average lifespan of adult mosquitoes ( in days ) ;    @xmath17 number of eggs at each deposit per capita ( per day ) ;    @xmath18 natural mortality of larvae ( per day ) ;    @xmath19 maturation rate from larvae to adult ( per day ) ;    @xmath20 female mosquitoes per human ;    @xmath21 total number of larvae per human .",

    "if @xmath48 , then the mosquito population is sustainable . from a biological standpoint ,",

    "the eradication of _ aedes aegypti _ may not be feasible and , from the environment point of view , not desirable .",
    "the aim is to reduce the mosquito density and increase the immunity on the humans .",
    "population herd immunity can be reached by increasing the total number of resistant persons to the disease , which implies that these persons have been infected , or through vaccination .",
    "no commercially available clinical cure or vaccine is currently available for dengue , but efforts are to develop one @xcite .",
    "effective vaccines have been produced against other flavivirus diseases such as yellow fever , japanese encephalitis , and tick - borne encephalitis , so there is good hope for a vaccine for dengue .",
    "we now simulate the epidemiological model with vaccination .",
    "while direct individual protection is the major focus of mass vaccination program , population effects also contribute to individual protection through herd immunity , providing protection for unprotected individuals @xcite .",
    "the more vaccinated people , the less likely a susceptible person will come into contact with the infection . with the introduction of a vaccine , the sir model related to the human population is augmented into the svir model of figure  [ modelosvir ] , where @xmath110 represents the total number of vaccinated people .",
