    "methods for predicting the secondary structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence have been developed for 3 decades .",
    "besides neural network models and nearest - neighbor methods , the statistically based chou - fasman / gor method is well - established and commonly used . in 1974 , assuming an oversimplified independency to cope with the large size 20 of the amino acid alphabets at a small size of database , chou and fasman ( 1974 ) derived a table of propensity for a particular residue to be in a given secondary structure state . by combining with a set of rules ,",
    "the protein secondary structure was predicted using this propensity .",
    "later , in the first version of the gor program ( garnier , osguthorpe , and robson , 1978 ) , the state of a single residue @xmath0 was predicted according to a window from @xmath1 to @xmath2 surrounding the residue .",
    "unlike chou - fasman which assumes that each amino acid individually influences its own secondary structure state , gor takes into account the influence of the amino acids flanking the central residue on the central residue state by deriving an information score from the weight matrix describing 17 individual amino acid frequencies at sites @xmath3 with @xmath4 . by using a single weight matrix ,",
    "the correlation among amino acids within the window was still ignored . in the later version gor iii ( gibrat , garnier , and robson , 1987 ) , instead of single weight matrix for every structure state , 20 weight matrices",
    ", each of which corresponds to a specific type of the central residue , were used .",
    "these conditional weight matrices take the pair correlation between the central residue and a flanking one into account . in the most recent version of gor ( gor iv , garnier , gibrat , and robson , 1996 ) ,",
    "all pairwise combinations of amino acids in the flanking region were included .",
    "the gor program maps a local window of residues in the sequence to the structural state of the central residue in the window .",
    "correlations among positions within the window is essential for improvements in prediction accuracy .",
    "we give an example to show the importance of high order correlations .",
    "for central residue @xmath5 being at the extended strand state , the conditional probability for @xmath6 is @xmath7 , while the conditional probability for @xmath6 at @xmath5 and @xmath8 is @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . with the growth of protein structure database , now the size of known protein structures allows us to consider correlations higher than pair ones .",
    "here we shall extend the gor program to include triple correlations , developing a program to predict protein secondary structure based on residue pairs ( pssrp ) . as a method using single sequence ,",
    "the computation required is rather light , but its prediction accuracy reaches 70% .",
    "kabsch and sander ( 1983 ) define eight states of secondary structure according to the hydrogen - bond pattern . as in most methods , we consider 3 states @xmath11 generated from the 8 by the coarse - graining @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "a window is a sequence segment @xmath15 of the width @xmath16 .",
    "consider two residues @xmath17 and @xmath18 inside the window ( with @xmath19 ) .",
    "their conformation state are @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "let us denote by @xmath22 the set of the sites within the window with @xmath23 and @xmath3 excluded .",
    "when discussing probability , we ignore the starting site index @xmath24 .",
    "the chou - fasman propensity of residue @xmath25 to conformation @xmath20 is defined by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the probability for residue @xmath25 to appear , and @xmath28 the conditional probability for @xmath25 to be at conformation @xmath20 .",
    "here we use only a logarithmic propensity , the logarithm of @xmath29 : @xmath30 as an extension of the chou - fasman propensity of residues , the propensity of residue pair @xmath31 to conformation @xmath32 may be defined as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the probability for residue pair @xmath25 and @xmath35 to appear with their site index difference being @xmath36 , and @xmath37 the conditional probability on the condition that the conformation states of @xmath25 and @xmath35 are @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .    when a window flanking the pair @xmath31 is examined to infer",
    "the conformation @xmath32 of @xmath31 , a further extension of the chou - fasman propensity is @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are now probability for the whole window , i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath22 . making the assumption of independency",
    ", we introduce the conditional weight matrix @xmath41 of @xmath42 columns and 20 rows , whose entries describe the probability for a specific residue @xmath43 to appear at some flanking site , say the @xmath44-th site from the window starting position",
    ". we denote the probability by @xmath45 , and write @xmath46 a similar simplification for @xmath40 is @xmath47 where the meaning of @xmath48 is analogous to @xmath45 .",
    "the window score @xmath49 for pair @xmath31 to be at conformation @xmath32 is then defined as the logarithmic ratio of @xmath50 : @xmath51 + \\sum_{n\\in w } \\log\\left [ \\frac{q_{d , n } ( a_{i+n}|xy,\\alpha\\beta ) } { q_{d , n}(a_{i+n}|xy ) } \\right].\\ ] ]    so far we have not determined the window width @xmath16 and the position of the inferred residue pair inside the window , especially the separation @xmath36 of the two residues . to do this , we need a measure of the distance between two probability distributions .",
    "a well defined measure is the kullback - leibler ( kl ) distance or relative entropy ( kullback et al .",
    ", 1959 ; kullback , 1987 ; sakamoto et al . , 1986 ) ,",
    "which , for two distributions @xmath52 and @xmath53 , is given by @xmath54 it corresponds a likelihood ratio , and , if @xmath55 is expanded around @xmath56 , its leading term is the @xmath57 distance .",
    "it is often to use the following symmetrized form @xmath58.\\ ] ] the distance @xmath59 $ ] measures the power for site @xmath60 to infer conformation @xmath32 .",
    "asymptotically @xmath61 approaches zero , when @xmath44 becomes far away from the sites of pair @xmath31 .",
    "the power for a window to infer conformation @xmath32 of @xmath31 may be measured by @xmath62 , the window sum distance averaged with the weight @xmath63 .",
    "we find a reasonable choice is @xmath64 and @xmath65 with residue @xmath35 being at 9-th site of the window .",
    "detailed discussion will be published elsewhere . due to limited samples ,",
    "we consider only @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 excluded .      using scores @xmath49 and sliding windows , we may calculate scores of true and false windows for each combination of @xmath69 and @xmath36 .",
    "the threshold @xmath70 is determined by the error rate 5% at which non-@xmath32 conformations are wrongly predicted as @xmath32 . for a given window ,",
    "if its score @xmath49 is greater than the corresponding threshold @xmath70 , we say that ` @xmath25 at @xmath20 ' , ` @xmath35 at @xmath21 ' and ` @xmath31 at @xmath32 ' are _ evidenced _ by the event @xmath71 .",
    "* step 1 : * if ` @xmath31 at @xmath32 ' is evidenced by event @xmath71 , and , at the same time , both ` @xmath25 at @xmath20 ' and ` @xmath35 at @xmath21 ' are further evidenced by some other events , we say that ` @xmath31 at @xmath32 ' is _ strongly confirmed_. determine all strongly confirmed pairs .",
    "* step 2 : *    we now consider the case that ` @xmath31 at @xmath32 ' is evidenced , but not strongly confirmed .",
    "if either ` @xmath72 at @xmath73 ' or ` @xmath74 at @xmath75 ' is strongly confirmed , we say that ` @xmath31 at @xmath32 ' is _ weakly confirmed_. determine all the weakly confirmed pairs .",
    "* step 3 : *    from a confirmed pair , either strongly or weakly , we calculate the score @xmath76 for single residue @xmath25 to be at conformation @xmath20 according to @xmath77 where only confirmed pairs are searched for maximum .",
    "the conformation of @xmath25 is finally inferred as @xmath78 i.e. @xmath79 is the @xmath20 corresponding to the maximal @xmath76 .",
    "infer residue conformation for all the confirmed pairs .",
    "* step 4 : *    in this step we expand already inferred @xmath80 and @xmath81 segments in both direction .",
    "suppose residue @xmath25 be a candidate for elongating @xmath81 .",
    "we calculate score @xmath82 according to ( [ x ] ) , but now only pairs fit ` @xmath25 at @xmath81 ' are searched for maximum .",
    "if @xmath82 is positive , we assign conformation @xmath81 to @xmath25 .",
    "the elongation of @xmath80 is similar .",
    "* step 5 : *    at both ends of the sequence no full windows are available .",
    "the first and last two residues are always assigned to @xmath83 . with the contribution of the missing sites set as zero , scores @xmath76 of some residue @xmath25 in the end regions are calculated for the elongation of the already determined boundary conformation @xmath20 in a similar way to the last step . for remaining residues we examine only the cases of four successive residues , say @xmath84 , in the same confirmation @xmath20 by calculating @xmath85 , and then infer the conformation according to the largest positive score .",
    "* step 6 : *    this final step is filtering .",
    "each single residue @xmath80 and @xmath81 segment is discarded .",
    "a conformation segment @xmath86 is expanded to @xmath87 according to whichever neighbor site has a large score for @xmath80 .",
    "each residue whose conformation can not be predicted so far is assigned to conformation @xmath83 .",
    "let us explain the prediction steps in more words by a simple example .",
    "suppose that total of five events are found for segment pdefghi of a sequence as shown as follows .",
    "... aclmnpdefghikqrst ...",
    "--e.c--            e.e----            ----c.h            ----ch-            ----cc- ....    in step 1 , eg at ec is strongly confirmed by the first three events .",
    "this is the only strongly confirmed pair in the segment .",
    "based on the pair , in step 2 we find that , all the remaining four events are weakly confirmed . in step 3 , we can easily infer ` p at e ' , ` e at e ' , ` g at c ' , and ` i at h ' .",
    "further calculation of @xmath88 and @xmath89 leads to ` h at h ' .",
    "the conformation of pdefghi is now inferred as e - e - chh .",
    "step 4 then fills up the gaps to get eeeechh .",
    "we create a nonredundant set of 1612 non - membrane proteins for training parameters from pdb_select ( hobohm and sander , 1994 ) with amino acid identity less than 25% issued on 25 september of 2001 .",
    "the secondary structure for these sequences are taken from dssp database ( kabsch and sander , 1983 ) . as mentioned above ,",
    "the eight states of dssp are coarse - grained into 3 states : @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath83 .",
    "this learning set contains 268031 residues with known conformations , among which 94415 are @xmath80 , 56510 are @xmath81 , and 117106 are @xmath83 .",
    "the size of the learning set is reasonable for training our parameters .",
    "to convert observed amino acid counts into frequencies or probabilities for scoring is a basic problem faced in training .",
    "a practical approach is to use pseudocounts ( aitchison and dumsmore , 1972 ) .",
    "we estimate background amino acid frequencies @xmath90 directly from counts of the whole learning set .",
    "then , we estimate the weight matrix element @xmath48 from the count @xmath91 of amino acid @xmath43 at position @xmath44 under the condition that residue pair @xmath31 with separation @xmath36 is in conformation @xmath32 as follows .",
    "@xmath92 where @xmath93 , indicating specifically only @xmath44 and @xmath94 , stands for @xmath95 , and @xmath96 stands for @xmath97 . here",
    ", the conditional probability @xmath93 is estimated by using a pseudocount propotional to the background distribution @xmath98 .",
    "if @xmath99 is less than 10 , the sample size is too small to reliably estimate the score .",
    "no such scores will be used for inference . or , equivalently speaking , they are set to be negative infinity .    in order to assess the accuracy of our approach , we use the following 2 test sets : sets 1 and 2 .",
    "a set of 124 nonhomologous proteins is created from the representative database of rost and sander ( 1993 ) by removing subunits a and b of hemagglutinin 3hmg , which are designated as membrane protein by scop ( murzin et al , 1995 ) .",
    "the 124 sequences and the learning set are not independent of each other according to hssp database ( dodge , schneider and sander , 1998 ) .",
    "that is , some proteins of the 124 sequences and certain proteins in the learning set belong to the same putative homologue family of hssp . removing these proteins from the 124 sequences and 5 seuqences with unknown amino acid segments longer than 6 , we construct set 1 of 76 proteins , a subset of the 124 sequences .",
    "34 proteins with known structures of the casp4 database issued in december of 2000 are taken as set 2 .",
    "the predicted counts of each conformation type in the test sets are listed in table 1 .",
    "the quantities assessing accuracy on single residue level for a given test set are the total percent correct @xmath100 , percent of types @xmath80 and @xmath81 predicted correctly ( sensitivity @xmath101 ) and percent of predictions correct for types @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( specificity @xmath102 ) .",
    "results obtained on the test sets are listed in table 2 in comparison with the results of gor iv and ssp ( solovyev and salamov , 1991 , 1994 ) , another secondary structure predictor based on discriminant analysis using single sequence .",
    "the approach pssrp performs very well .",
    "the overall value of @xmath100 averaged over sets 1 and 2 is 70.2% .",
    "we show @xmath100 statistics for sets 1 and 2 in fig .  1 .",
    "generally , strongly confirmed pairs are the portion with a high confidence in prediction .",
    "strongly confirmed pairs cover 58.4% and 53.8% of set 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "there is a clear correlation between the coverage rate or the percentage of the strongly confirmed pairs in the total length of a sequence and accuracy @xmath100 , which are 79.5% and 77.4% for the coverage portion , respectively . to examine the correlation between the coverage rate @xmath103 of strongly confirmed pairs and the whole sequence accuracy @xmath100",
    ", we conduct simple linear regression of @xmath100 on @xmath103 for sets 1 and 2 , as shown in fig .  2 with regression line @xmath104 .",
    "correlation coefficient @xmath105 and standard deviation @xmath106 are 0.779 and 0.0276 for set 1 , while for set 2 , they are 0.830 and 0.0209 , and for the two sets total are 0.795 and 0.0253 .",
    "thus , the coverage rate of the strongly confirmed pairs provides us a self - checking confidence level of the prediction accuracy .",
    "@xmath100 measure gives an overall number of residues predicted correctly .",
    "it is well known that single - residue accuracy sometimes poorly reflects the quality of prediction .",
    "measures concentrating on secondary structure segment prediction accuracy would better reflect the nature of structure .",
    "a simple segment overlap measure is : a segment is considered correctly predicted if the predicted and observed segments have at least two amino acids in common ( taylor , 1984 ) .",
    "results of this segment prediction accuracy from our approach are listed in table 3 .",
    "we have presented an improved approach using single protein sequence to predict secondary structure .",
    "the improvement is achieved by including triple correlations .",
    "most recent improvements in accuracy come from methods which are capable to consider correlations nonlocal in sequence . combining evolutionary information via multiple alignments of homologous sequences",
    "is a main way to include such correlations .",
    "although methods using single sequence generally can not cope with nonlocal correlations easily , their simple nature of requiring least computation in the prediction step is still attractive .",
    "there are rooms for further improvement of pssrp .",
    "the original scores are obtained for residue pairs .",
    "the scores are then converted to those for single residues in the prediction step 3 .",
    "it is possible to construct a scoring system to directly use pair scores by introducing appropriate weighting .",
    "we may tune the thresholds to compromise @xmath102 with @xmath101 .",
    "we may integrate the segment length statistics into the approach , e.g. by dynamic programming .",
    "the size of the amino acid alphabets is 20 .",
    "number of parameters increases drastically with the order of correlations considered .",
    "a statistical model containing a tremendous number of parameters will require a huge learning set to train parameters .",
    "furthermore , an over - complicated model can easily result in overfitting .",
    "it seems that the overfitting is not too serious . a way to reduce",
    "the number of parameters is to coarse - grain the 20 amino acids into a small number of categories .",
    "this is under study .",
