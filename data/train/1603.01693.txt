    "according to [ firstbelyi ] , their degrees in the dessin of @xmath135 are given by @xmath19 and @xmath179 respectively .",
    "these degrees are reversed in the dessin of @xmath419 : writing down the @xmath429-expansion and carefully analyzing charts around these points of @xmath26 , it is not hard to see that the orders of poles at @xmath132 $ ] and @xmath46 $ ] of @xmath28\\in x_0(n)\\mapsto j(nz)$ ] are @xmath179 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "+    [ modular2 ] let us study the belyi function @xmath420\\mapsto \\frac{1}{1728}j(2z)$ ] on @xmath430 , where a complete set of left coset representatives of @xmath378 in @xmath9 is given by : @xmath431 action of their transpose matrices is given by @xmath432 and @xmath433 .",
    "now , using : @xmath434 orbits of @xmath378 appeared above are black and white vertices of the dessin on @xmath430 corresponding to @xmath419 .",
    "but we should omit repetitions of orbits : @xmath435 are congruent modulo the action of @xmath378 : @xmath436 send the first point to the other two .",
    "hence , there is only one black vertex , @xmath437 $ ] whose degree is three as @xmath378 does not have any elliptic element of the order three . for white vertices , in the second line of @xmath438 and @xmath439 are inequivalent under the action of @xmath9 while @xmath440 maps @xmath438 to @xmath441 .",
    "we deduce that there are two white vertices : @xmath442 $ ] and @xmath443=\\left[\\frac{{\\rm{i}}+1}{2}\\right]$ ] .",
    "the degree of such a vertex is one iff it is the unique order two elliptic orbit of @xmath378 and otherwise equals two . according to the dessin in figure 6 and the discussion after it ,",
    "@xmath444 $ ] is the unique elliptic orbit of @xmath378 . up to now , the dessin of @xmath419 on @xmath445 possesses three edges , one black vertex of degree three and two white vertices of degrees one and two which implies that there are two faces .",
    "but as we observed before , points @xmath132,[\\infty]$ ] are two vertices of degrees @xmath179 and @xmath263 each corresponds to a face .",
    "the coordinates of @xmath444,[0],[\\infty]$ ] may be read off from the dessin of @xmath135 in figure 6 which implies that @xmath446 must be in the form of @xmath447 satisfying @xmath448 where @xmath449 , \\beta=\\left[\\frac{{\\rm{i}}}{2}\\right]$ ] . fixing three vertices of a dessin on @xmath15 rigidifies it so the unknowns @xmath450 and @xmath451 are readily determined : @xmath452 .",
    "thus @xmath453 and the dessin is depicted in figure 9 .      combining this with the results of example [ gamma_0(2 ) ] : @xmath454 whose",
    "dessins are illustrated in figures 6 and 9 .",
    "therefore , we arrive at equations @xmath455 and @xmath456 for meromorphic functions @xmath28\\mapsto j(z)$ ] and @xmath28\\mapsto j(2z)$ ] on @xmath457 and we must find their algebraic dependence relation .",
    "a simple observation helps us to accomplish this : changing @xmath44 to @xmath458 in them yields new rational functions @xmath459 and @xmath460 where the former transforms to the latter by substituting @xmath44 with @xmath461 .",
    "we deduce that any polynomial equation that @xmath462 and @xmath463 satisfy is symmetric in them and actually a polynomial relation between @xmath464 and @xmath465 which are polynomials in @xmath466 .",
    "@xmath467 one can compute the algebraic dependence relation between the above quadratic and cubic in @xmath468 ( which is straightforward using the division algorithm ) and then in the derived equation replace them with @xmath469 and @xmath470 respectively .",
    "the result is the modular equation for @xmath378 : @xmath471    [ modular3 ] here , we derive an equation for the belyi function @xmath420\\mapsto \\frac{1}{1728}j(3z)$ ] on @xmath472",
    ". let us work with the following complete set of representatives : @xmath473 wherein @xmath474 their transpose matrices may be written as : @xmath475 substituting in and noting that @xmath89 and @xmath476 stabilize @xmath7 and @xmath27 respectively : @xmath477 we should exclude repeated @xmath395-orbits in in order to get black and white vertices of the dessin on @xmath478 corresponding to @xmath419 .",
    "orbits @xmath479 $ ] , @xmath480 $ ] coincide with @xmath113 $ ] appeared as a vertex of the dessin in figure 7 ( @xmath481 and @xmath482 where @xmath483 ) while it can be easily verified that no element of @xmath9 carries @xmath484 to @xmath485 .",
    "hence , there are two black vertices : @xmath479,\\left[\\frac{2\\rho-5}{\\rho-2}\\right]$ ] .",
    "the degree of a black vertex is one iff it is an order three elliptic orbit of @xmath395 .",
    "following discussions in example [ gamma_0(3 ) ] based on the dessin in figure 7 , @xmath113 $ ] is the only elliptic orbit of @xmath395 .",
    "for white vertices , in the second line of @xmath486 and @xmath379 are inequivalent under the action of @xmath9 .",
    "we deduce that there are two white vertices : @xmath487 $ ] and @xmath488 $ ] , each one of degree two because @xmath395 does not have any elliptic point of order two .",
    "there are two faces @xmath132,[\\infty]$ ] which form the set of cusps orbits of @xmath395 and their degrees are @xmath179 and @xmath383 respectively .",
    "this gives us the depiction of the dessin of @xmath419 in figure 10 where the coordinates of @xmath113,[0],[\\infty]$ ] have been obtained from the dessin of @xmath135 ( figure 7 ) shows that in the dessin of the belyi function @xmath28\\in x_0(n)\\mapsto\\frac{1}{1728}j(nz)$ ] the edges are always in the form of @xmath489 \\big | \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\leq \\theta\\leq\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right\\}$ ] where @xmath490 . when @xmath383 , this fact guides us in drawing the dessin in figure 10 : vertices corresponding to orbits of @xmath491 and @xmath492 $ ] should be connected .",
    "the former is @xmath113 $ ] as @xmath493 maps @xmath494 to @xmath396 . ] .",
    "again , these three coordinates rigidify the dessin and the coordinates of unknown vertices @xmath487 $ ] , @xmath495 $ ] and @xmath479 $ ] will be uniquely determined .",
    "we leave the details to the reader and just exhibit the final picture in figure 10 and an equation for @xmath419 after that :      @xmath496 recalling results of example [ gamma_0(3 ) ] , our pair of belyi functions on @xmath472 is : @xmath497 compare their dessins in figures 7 and 10 .",
    "next task is to compute the algebraic equation that meromorphic functions @xmath498 and @xmath499 satisfy .",
    "again , the pair @xmath500 has a property that facilitates this : @xmath501 , i.e. after substituting @xmath44 with @xmath458 in @xmath502 and @xmath503 , the resulting expressions @xmath504 and @xmath505 transform to each other under @xmath506 .",
    "consequently , everything reduces to finding the algebraic dependence relation between sum and product of two rational functions that were just described which themselves are polynomials in @xmath466 : @xmath507 it only remains to derive the algebraic dependence relation between the cubic and the quartic in @xmath468 appeared above ( this is a bit harder and best carried out with a computer algebra package such as maple ) and then substitute the cubic ( which came from @xmath508 ) with @xmath469 and the quartic ( which came from @xmath509 ) with @xmath470 .",
    "this culminates in the modular equation for @xmath395 below : @xmath510    the existence of a relation such as @xmath501 between two belyi functions in either of or that facilitated computing the algebraic dependence for either of these pairs is not accidental .",
    "@xmath511 is an involution of @xmath512 composition by which in either of pairs swaps the functions in that pair .",
    "an involution of @xmath26 with this property always exists and is the well - defined holomorphic involution @xmath28\\mapsto \\left[\\frac{-1}{nz}\\right]$ ] of @xmath513 . composing it with the belyi function @xmath416\\mapsto\\frac{1}{1728}j(z)$ ] yields @xmath28\\mapsto\\frac{1}{1728}j\\left(\\frac{-1}{nz}\\right)=j(nz)$ ] which is the belyi function @xmath419 . since under this involution @xmath135",
    "goes to @xmath419 , the symmetry of all algebraic equations that @xmath514 satisfy and in particular the modular equation will readily be inferred .",
    "we summarize our method :    [ modularequation ] for any @xmath515 , there is a pair of belyi functions consists of @xmath516\\mapsto\\frac{1}{1728}j(z ) \\end{cases}\\quad \\begin{cases } g : x_0(n)\\rightarrow\\bbb{cp}^1\\\\ [ z]\\mapsto\\frac{1}{1728}j(nz ) \\end{cases}\\ ] ] on the compact riemann surface @xmath513 .",
    "they generate the function field of @xmath26 and transform to each other after being composed with the holomorphic involution @xmath28\\mapsto \\left[\\frac{-1}{nz}\\right]$ ] .",
    "the minimal polynomial of @xmath463 over @xmath517 is symmetric and precisely the modular equation for @xmath20 .",
    "we finish with another interesting consequences of the constructions used in the last two examples .",
    "suppose that in proposition [ modularequation ] after fixing the dessin of @xmath135 ( cf .",
    "remark [ rigid ] ) , @xmath20-orbits that occur as vertices of the dessin of @xmath419 have been determined after necessary group - theoretic arguments and also the positions of these vertices on @xmath26 are known . evaluating @xmath518 at them",
    "might lead to some non - trivial @xmath4-invariant calculations because among the vertices of the dessin of @xmath419 there are some new orbits that had not appeared previously .",
    "for example , compare figures 6 and 9 where @xmath263 and figures 7 and 10 where @xmath383 .",
    "in the first case , evaluating the belyi function @xmath519 derived in at @xmath437=\\frac{3}{4}$ ] and @xmath442=\\frac{9}{8}$ ] leads to : @xmath520 and in the second case , in example [ modular3 ] one should compute the values of @xmath521 at points @xmath479=\\frac{8}{9}$ ] , @xmath488=\\frac{6 - 2\\sqrt{3}}{9}$ ] and @xmath487=\\frac{6 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{9}$ ] : @xmath522 another interesting set of values of the modular @xmath4-function can be obtained by evaluating @xmath462 at fixed points of the involution mentioned in proposition [ modularequation ] . in both of examples [ modular2 ] and [ modular3 ] this involution",
    "was given by @xmath523 whose fixed points are @xmath524 . when @xmath263 , under the action of @xmath378 we have @xmath28=[\\frac{-1}{2z}]$ ] for @xmath525 .",
    "since @xmath439 is congruent with @xmath526 under the action of @xmath9 : @xmath527 which coincides with value of @xmath528 at @xmath529 .",
    "so @xmath530 must be @xmath531 .",
    "finally , when @xmath383 , under the action of @xmath395 , @xmath28=[\\frac{-1}{3z}]$ ] for @xmath532 .",
    "the @xmath4-function and @xmath502 vanish at @xmath27 and @xmath529 respectively .",
