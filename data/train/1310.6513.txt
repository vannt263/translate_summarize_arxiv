    "it is well known that correlations of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) depends on the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom , @xmath0 , which is usually given in terms of the effective number of neutrinos species present in the era before recombination .",
    "the expected value of @xmath1 is consistent with observations thus far .",
    "however , recent measurements of cmb from the planck satellite  @xcite combined with that of the hubble constant from the hubble space telescope ( hst )  @xcite resulted in a higher value of @xmath2 at 95%cl .",
    "if one further includes data from wmap9  @xcite , atacama cosmology telescope ( act )  @xcite and south pole telescope ( spt )  @xcite into the analysis , the extracted value becomes @xmath3 at 95%cl .",
    "this hints at a dark radiation ( dr ) component beyond the expected three neutrino species at a confidence level of @xmath4 .",
    "the origin and nature of such dr component is not known .",
    "one possibility , as pointed out recently by weinberg  @xcite , is that it can be naturally associated with a massless or nearly massless goldstone boson arising the spontaneous breaking of a @xmath5 global symmetry",
    ". a goldstone boson will count as 4/7 of a neutrino , and this appears to agree with observation .",
    "however , in order for the temperature of the goldstone bosons to match with that of the neutrinos , they must remain in thermal equilibrium with ordinary matter until muon annihilation .",
    "if goldstone bosons decouple much earlier , they will contribute less than 4/7 to @xmath0 as they will not be reheated but the neutrinos do .",
    "decoupling in the muon annihilation era yields a contribution @xmath6 .",
    "weinberg further proposed that the @xmath5 global symmetry be a new one associated with a dark sector with its own matter content .",

    "we examine the possibility of taking the global @xmath5 symmetry to be the lepton number .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of this @xmath7 by singlet higgs will give rise to a majoron  @xcite , which we associate with the goldstone boson that acts as dr .",
    "since the singlet that breaks the @xmath7 will mix with the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , this allows us to connect higgs physics and dr to neutrino physics .",
    "in particular , we are able to link constraints on the parameters of the scalar sector to that in the seesaw mechanism responsible for neutrino mass generation , and to study their interrelations . we illustrate this in type - i seesaw  @xcite and inverse seesaw  @xcite scenarios in this letter .",

    "[ sec : fmw ] , we describe in detail the framework we use to study the interrelation between the majorons , the neutrinos , and the scalars . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lec ] , we discuss some consequences on the scalar and neutrino parameters from measurements of the muon magnetic moment , lamb shift of the muonic hydrogen , and decay rate of @xmath8 . in sec .",

    "the simplest majoron model extends the standard model ( sm ) by three generations of singlet righthanded ( rh ) neutrinos , @xmath9 , and a singlet complex scalar , @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the relevant yukawa interactions read @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the lefthanded ( lh ) sm lepton doublet , and @xmath13 with @xmath14 the sm higgs ; the generation indices are suppressed for clarity . note that there is an accidental global @xmath5 symmetry associated with the conservation of lepton number ( @xmath15 ) before electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) if @xmath10 is defined to have @xmath16 .",
    "after ewsb , we can write @xmath17 in the unitary gauge , where @xmath18  gev , and @xmath19 the yukawa interactions   then give rise to neutrino masses , which take the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and we have redefined the lepton fields , @xmath23 , to remove the @xmath24 phase factor from the majorana mass terms . note that this induces the interactions @xmath25 from the lepton kinetic terms @xmath26 .    if @xmath27 , the standard type - i seesaw is operative .",
    "it is well known in this case that the light active neutrinos have masses @xmath28 . to have @xmath29  ev , we require @xmath30 as a benchmark , take @xmath31  tev and @xmath32 .",
    "then acceptable light neutrino masses can be obtained with @xmath33 the size of the electron yukawa couplings , @xmath34 .",
    "we shall refer to couplings with sizes smaller than @xmath34 as excessively fine tuned .",
    "type - i seesaw is not the only way neutrino masses can be generated , however .",
    "a phenomenologically more interesting case is the inverse seesaw .",
    "the inverse seesaw can be implemented by adding ",

    "consider now the scalar sector .",
    "the most general renormalizable lagrangian for it is given by @xmath61 after ewsb , the kinetic term for @xmath10 takes the form @xmath62 and we identify the canonically normalized goldstone boson @xmath63 as the majoron .",

    "classical stability of the vacuum demands that @xmath75 and we see from above that these conditions are automatically satisfied for @xmath76 real and positive .",

    "the partial width is given by @xmath77 from the lhc , the higgs invisible decay branching ratio is about 19%  @xcite . with the higgs width at about 4.1  mev  @xcite",
    ", this means that @xmath78 currently , the lhc data on higgs gauge boson couplings is consistent with sm expectations , which suggests small mixings with possible extended scalar sectors beyond the sm . as a benchmark ,",
    "we take @xmath79 , and we get @xmath80  tev . note",
    "that this lower bound on @xmath81 is relaxed if the bound on the mixing angle , @xmath82 , becomes more stringent .",

    "@xcite , if the majoron is to play the role of dark radiation that give rise to the fractional value of @xmath84 measured , it should stay in thermal equilibrium until roughly the time when muon annihilation happens .",
    "then this requires the collision rate of majorons with muons to be roughly the hubble expansion rate : @xmath85 where we take @xmath86  gev . with the help of eqs .   and",

    "@xmath87 then with @xmath88  mev , we obtain @xmath89  gev from @xmath90 , and from eq .   and",
    "the benchmark @xmath91 : @xmath92 we see that in order to have no excessive fine tuning in the couplings , the lepton number breaking scale ( as given by @xmath81 ) should be in the range of 1 to 30  tev . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that type - i seesaw scenarios generally prefer a much higher scale , so @xmath81 should be very large , which then requires an excessive tuning of @xmath93 .",
    "there is thus a tension between the very high scale type - i seesaw and the identification of majoron as dr in such scenarios .",
    "such tension , however , can be circumvented in the inverse seesaw scenario . as is seen in eq .",
    ", there are two scales that control the size of active neutrino masses , viz . @xmath37 and @xmath81 . without pushing @xmath93 to the nonperturbative region , we can take @xmath81 to be as low as @xmath94  gev and still easily have @xmath29  ev for the active neutrinos .",
    "for example , take @xmath95 , then @xmath37 can be as low as a few hundred gev as long as @xmath96 .",
    "this is an interesting region for lhc to look for heavy neutrinos that mix with the active ones , which we explore below in sec .",
    "[ sec : dy ] .",
    "we note that low values of @xmath81 imply small mixings with the sm higgs .",
    "due to scalar mixing , the light extra scalar @xmath97 has coupling @xmath98 to the muon arising from the higgs yukawa interactions with the fermions and is directly proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "its contribution to the muon magnetic moment is given by  @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 , and @xmath102 currently , the discrepancy between the experimental and theory value of @xmath103 is  @xcite @xmath104 we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : phidamu ] the parameter space that this is accounted for by the @xmath97 contribution .    .",

    "the horizontal blue line marks the benchmark lhc upper bound on the mixing angle , @xmath106,width=326 ]    we see that only when @xmath107  gev is the benchmark bound on the mixing angle satisfied .",
    "we see also that the benchmark allowed parameter space has @xmath105 lower than its current central value .    given the benchmark allowed parameter space",
    ", we can work out how much the additional scalar , @xmath97 , contributes to the lamb shift in muonic hydrogen .",
    "the energy difference from the @xmath108-@xmath109 splitting in hydrogen is given by  @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the reduced mass , and @xmath112 is the effective yukawa couplings of @xmath97 to the proton , with @xmath113  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : dels ] shows the magnitude of this energy shift in the parameter space allowed by both @xmath105 and our lhc benchmark .    , the red dashed curve that when the shift in the muon magnetic moment is kept constant at @xmath114 , one sigma below the central value.,width=326 ]    we see that the maximum lamb shift coming from @xmath97 alone is about 210  @xmath115ev , and this requires a very light @xmath97 with mass about 1  mev .",
    "although this is a significant portion of the 310  @xmath115ev needed to reconcile the current 7@xmath116 discrepancy between the committee on data for science and technology ( codata ) value on the proton charge radius  @xcite  which is determined purely from electron scatterings  and that measured from muonic hydrogen lamb shift  @xcite , it is not enough on its own . to solve the proton radius puzzle , additional ingredients besides",
    "@xmath97 is necessary .      the radiative @xmath118 decay here is mediated by both @xmath119 and heavy majorana neutrino exchanges at one - loop .",
    "we can place limits on the neutrino mixings from the branching ratio of this decay .",
    "the gauge - invariant effective operator for @xmath117 has the form @xmath120 , with the heavy neutrino mass , @xmath121 , the controlling scale here . for simplicity , we assume that the @xmath122 couplings are flavor universal given by @xmath123",
    ". we shall use @xmath124 and @xmath125 here and below to denote generically the heavy majorana neutrinos and their mixings with the light neutrino respectively ( e.g. @xmath126 for type - i seesaw , @xmath127 for inverse seesaw ) .",
    "the effective lagrangian then reads @xmath128 following ref .",
    "@xcite , the corresponding dipole coefficient is estimated as @xmath129 and thus the branching ratio of @xmath130 @xmath131 which implies @xmath132 this constraint can be easily accommodated in both neutrino mass models .",
    "at the parton level , the drell - yan ( dy ) production of the heavy majorana neutrino , @xmath124 , at the lhc proceeds predominantly through two processes : @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the parton level cross - sections read @xmath135 where @xmath136 , @xmath125 is the heavy - light neutrino mixing , and @xmath137 with @xmath138 the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy , and @xmath139 the parton momentum fractions .",
    "the production cross - section at the lhc is obtained after a convolution with the parton distribution functions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp2nl ] , we show the inclusive production cross - section obtained using madgraph 5  @xcite for the lhc at 14  tev cm energy .",

    "it is very unlikely to produce a heavy majorana neutrino at lhc in the type - i seesaw scenario , given that it would be very heavy ( @xmath149  tev ) , and the mixings involved are very small . for the inverse seesaw scenario however ,",
    "since the heavy majorana neutrino can be relatively light at a few hundred gev and the mixing relatively large , it is possible to probe directly this scenario at lhc14 , which is expected to have a luminosity of @xmath150 . in particular , we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : pp2nl ] that for @xmath151  gev , one could have @xmath152  fb if @xmath153 , which is easily obtainable in inverse seesaw .",
    "we leave a detailed study of the collider signals involved to future works .",
    "we have studied in this letter the implications of identifying the majoron as dr . assuming that it goes out of equilibrium at the muon annihilation temperature , it can account for the fractional value of the effective neutrino species , @xmath84 , measured recently by planck .",
    "the consequence of this for the extended scalar sector associated with the majoron is the presence of a very light scalar boson with mass @xmath154  gev that mixes with the sm higgs .",
    "furthermore , the scale of the extended scalar sector , @xmath81 , can not be too high if excessive fine tuning of the parameters in the scalar potential is to be avoided .",
    "the scalar sector scale , @xmath81 , also sets the scale for the neutrino sector .",
    "a relatively low @xmath81 would however cause tension with the canonical type - i seesaw scenario , which typically require a heavy scale above @xmath155 gev . on the other hand ,",
    "such tension would not arise in the inverse seesaw scenario .",
    "there , one can taking @xmath81 to be as low as a tev without fine tuning either the yukawa couplings or the scalar parameters , although consistency with the current lhc data then requires the mixing between the scalar singlet and the higgs doublet to be very small .",
    "this then implies that the corrections to the sm higgs couplings will be not measurable at the lhc .",
    "low energy physics can provide further constraints on the light scalar mass . by demanding that the light scalar account for discrepancy between the experimental and theory value of the muon magnetic moment while consistent with the lhc data , the light scalar mass is pushed down to below 0.02  gev .",
    "although not able to completely solve the proton radius puzzle on its own , the light scalar can contribute a significant amount towards the 310  @xmath115ev of the muonic hydrogen lamb shift required if it is even light with mass at around 1  mev .",
    "finally , we are hopeful that the inverse seesaw scenario may be directly probed at lhc14 given that the heavy neutrino can be relatively light and the mixing relatively large .",
