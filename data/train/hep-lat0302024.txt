    "in spite of recent progress in computer technology and numerical algorithms , extraction of continuum properties from lattice qcd remains to be challenging when dynamical quarks are included due to large computational demands .",
    "one of methods for alleviating the difficulty is to improve the lattice action for a faster approach to the continuum limit .",
    "this has enabled us to carry out the first systematic extrapolation to the chiral and continuum limits for the light hadron spectrum @xcite .",
    "another method which is effective for several quantities is to introduce a space - time anisotropy . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that using anisotropic lattices with a larger temporal cutoff is efficient for reducing lattice artifacts in thermal qcd , and have carried out the first well - controlled continuum extrapolation of the equation of state in quenched qcd .",
    "in finite temperature qcd , anisotropic lattices have been employed in the quenched approximation also to study transport coefficients @xcite , pole masses @xcite , glueballs @xcite , and spectral functions @xcite , where anisotropy was introduced to obtain more data points for temporal correlation functions . at zero temperature ,",
    "anisotropic lattices have been employed to study charmonium states @xcite , glueballs @xcite , heavy hybrids @xcite , and also the pion scattering length @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the anisotropy parameters for an improved full qcd action to contribute toward a systematic study of qcd with heavy quarks and at finite temperatures .",
    "the calculation of anisotropy parameters is not a simple task in full qcd because a couple of bare parameters have to be simultaneously adjusted to achieve a consistent renormalized anisotropy in physical observables for both quarks and gluons .",
    "this tuning of bare anisotropy parameters is called `` calibration '' @xcite .",
    "we study two - flavor full qcd with an rg - improved gauge action and a clover - improved wilson quark action , extending the combination of improved actions adopted by the cp - pacs collaboration to anisotropic lattices .",
    "carrying out simulations at several values of bare parameters , we perform the calibration to determine the bare anisotropy parameters for a given value of the renormalized anisotropy @xmath7 as functions of the gauge coupling and bare quark mass .",
    "we study the range of parameters corresponding to @xmath40.16 fm for the spatial lattice spacing and @xmath50.9 for the ratio of pseudoscalar and vector meson masses . based on our previous study of finite temperature qcd @xcite , we concentrate on the case @xmath8 in this paper",
    ".    different choices of observables for the calibration will lead to @xmath0 differences in the calibration results .",
    "we study this issue by comparing the results from two different observables  pseudoscalar and vector meson dispersion relations .",
    "we anticipate that the results of different calibrations will be useful for checking the stability of continuum extrapolations . as a test of the idea",
    ", we also perform a continuum extrapolation of the sommer scale at @xmath8 , by interpolating our measurement results to the calibrated points .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we define our anisotropic lattice action in sec .",

    "we also test how the difference in the calibration affects physical observables .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "an appendix is added to compare our calibration procedure with another method based on the ratio of screening and temporal masses .",
    "we study full qcd with two flavors of degenerate light quarks . on isotropic lattices , we have made a series of systematic studies adopting a clover - improved quark action coupled with an rg - improved glue @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the clover coefficient @xmath9 was set to the tadpole- improved value using the plaquette in one - loop perturbation theory for the mean - field .",
    "this choice was based on the observations that the one - loop plaquette reproduces the actual plaquette expectation values within 8% for the range of parameters studied , and that the resulting value of the clover coefficient agrees well with actual one - loop value of it .",
    "this action was shown to give both a good rotational symmetry of the heavy quark potential and a small scale violations in the light hadron spectra at moderate lattice spacings @xcite . at zero temperature",
    ", these good properties enabled us to carry out first systematic chiral and continuum extrapolations of light hadron spectra and light quark masses @xcite . at finite temperatures ,",
    "this combination of actions was shown to reproduce the expected o(4 ) scaling around the two - flavor chiral transition point @xcite , and was adopted in the first systematic calculation of the equation of state in lattice qcd with wilson - type quarks @xcite . here , we extend the study to anisotropic lattices .",
    "on isotropic lattices , the rg - improved gauge action by iwasaki @xcite consists of plaquettes and @xmath10 rectangular loops . extending it to anisotropic lattices ,",
    "the general form of the action is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are for spatial directions and @xmath15 are plaquette and rectangular loop in the @xmath16-@xmath17 plane , respectively .",
    "the improvement coefficients @xmath18 satisfy the normalization conditions , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the bare gauge coupling equals @xmath21 , and @xmath22 represents the bare anisotropy .",
    "we have three independent improvement parameters among @xmath18 .    in principle",
    ", these improvement coefficients may have non - trivial @xmath23 dependences depending on the improvement conditions on the anisotropic lattice . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have repeated the improvement procedure of iwasaki on anisotropic lattices , and found that , for small anisotropies @xmath244 , the @xmath23-dependences in the improvement coefficients are weak , and a sufficient improvement is achieved just by fixing the coefficients to iwasaki s values for isotropic lattices , @xmath25 . as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : parameter ] , we are interested in the case @xmath8 . because @xmath23-dependences in the improvement coefficients require additional elaborations in numerical simulations , such as computation of @xmath23-derivative terms in the equation of state ( eos ) , we fix the improvement coefficients to their isotropic values in the following .",

    ", it was shown that the fermionic bare anisotropy parameter corresponding to a fixed @xmath23 is well fitted by a quadratic function of @xmath39 with this choice of @xmath40 . with dynamical quarks , however , terms linear in @xmath39 may appear through quark loop corrections @xcite .",

    "we find that , when quarks are light , the effective mass of the spatial ps meson correlator does not show a clear plateau , and sometimes shows a decreasing tendency even at the maximum distance @xmath88 .",
