    "at low temperatures and densities the @xmath7 chiral symmetry of qcd lagrangian is spontaneously broken down to @xmath8 by the qcd vacuum ( in the large @xmath9 limit it would be @xmath10 ) .",
    "a direct evidence for the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is a nonzero value of the quark condensates for the light flavors @xmath11 which represent the order parameter . that this is indeed so , we know from three sources : current algebra , qcd sum rules , and lattice gauge calculations .",
    "there are two important generic consequences of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( sbcs ) .",
    "the first one is an appearance of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons of low mass , @xmath12 , which represent the associated approximate goldstone bosons ( in the large @xmath9 limit the flavor singlet state @xmath13 should be added ) .",
    "the second one is that valence ( practically massless ) quarks acquire a dynamical mass , which have been called historically constituent quarks .",
    "indeed , the nonzero value of the quark condensate itself implies at the formal level that there should be rather big dynamical mass , which could be in general a moment - dependent quantity @xcite .",
    "thus the constituent quarks should be considered as quasiparticles whose dynamical mass comes from the nonperturbative gluon and quark - antiquark dressing .",
    "the flavor - octet axial current conservation in the chiral limit tells that the constituent quarks and goldstone bosons should be coupled with the strength @xmath14 @xcite , which is a quark analog of the famous goldberger - treiman relation .",
    "we can not say at the moment for sure what is the microscopical mechanism for sbcs in qcd .",
    "any sufficiently strong scalar interaction between quarks will induce the sbcs ( e.g. the instanton - induced interaction contains the scalar part , or it can be generated by monopole condensation , etc . ) .",
    "the most general aspects of sbcs such as constituent quark mass generation , goldstone boson creation and their couplings are well illustrated by the nambu and jona - lasinio model @xcite .",
    "for the low - energy baryon properties it is only essential that beyond the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking scale ( i.e. at low resolution ) new dynamical degrees of freedom appear - constituent quarks and chiral fields which couple together .",
    "the low - energy baryon properties are mainly determined by these dynamical degrees of freedom and the confining interaction .",
    "we have recently suggested @xcite that in the low - energy regime light and strange baryons should be considered as a system of 3 constituent quarks with an effective @xmath15 interaction that is formed of central confining part and a chiral interaction mediated by the goldstone bosons between constituent quarks .",
    "this physical picture allows to understand a structure of the baryon spectrum and to solve , in particular , the long - standing problem of ordering of the lowest baryons with positive- and negative - parity .",
    "the coupling of the constituent quarks and the pseudoscalar goldstone bosons will ( in the @xmath16 symmetric approximation ) have the form @xmath17 within the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry ( it would be @xmath18 within the linear @xmath19-model chiral symmetry representation ) .",
    "a coupling of this form , in a nonrelativistic reduction for the constituent quark spinors , will  to lowest order  give rise the @xmath20 structure of the meson - quark vertex , where @xmath21 is meson momentum .",
    "thus , the structure of the potential between quarks `` @xmath22 '' and `` @xmath23 '' in momentum representation is    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is dressed green function for chiral field which includes both nonlinear terms of chiral lagrangian and fermion loops , @xmath26 is meson - quark formfactor which takes into account the internal structure of quasiparticles . at big distances ( @xmath27 ) , one has @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it then follows from ( [ 2 ] ) that @xmath30 , which means that the volume integral of the goldstone boson exchange ( gbe ) interaction should vanish ,    @xmath31    this sum rule is not valid in the chiral limit , however , where @xmath32 and , hence , @xmath33 .",
    "since at big interquark separations the spin - spin component of the pseudoscalar - exchange interaction is @xmath34 , it then follows from the sum rule above that at short interquark separations the spin - spin interaction should be opposite in sign as compared to the yukawa tail and very strong .",
    "_ it is this short - range part of the goldstone boson exchange ( gbe ) interaction between the constituent quarks that is of crucial importance for baryons : it has a sign appropriate to reproduce the level splittings and dominates over the yukawa tail towards short distances .",
    "_ in a oversimplified consideration with a free klein - gordon green function instead of the dressed one in ( [ 2 ] ) and with @xmath35 , one obtains the following spin - spin component of @xmath15 interaction :    @xmath36    in the chiral limit only the negative short - range part of the gbe interaction survives .",
    "consider first , for the purposes of illustration , a schematic model which neglects the radial dependence of the potential function @xmath37 in ( [ 3 ] ) , and assume a harmonic confinement among quarks as well as @xmath38 . in this model",
    "@xmath39    note , that contrary to the color - magnetic interaction from perturbative one - gluon exchange , the gbe interaction is explicitly flavor - dependent .",
    "it is this circumstance which allows to solve the long - standing problem of ordering of the lowest positive - negative parity states .",
    "if the only interaction between the quarks were the flavor- and spin - independent harmonic confining interaction , the baryon spectrum would be organized in multiplets of the symmetry group @xmath40 . in this case",
    "the baryon masses would be determined solely by the orbital structure , and the spectrum would be organized in an _ alternative sequence of positive and negative parity states , _ i.e. in this case the spectrum would be : ground state of positive parity ( @xmath41 shell , @xmath42 is the number of harmonic oscillator excitations in a 3-quark state ) , first excited band of negative parity ( @xmath43 ) , second excited band of positive parity ( @xmath44 ) , etc .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) , within a first order perturbation theory , reduces the @xmath40 symmetry down to @xmath45 , which automatically implies a splitting between the octet and decuplet baryons ( e.g. the @xmath46 resonance becomes heavier than nucleon ) .",
    "let us now see how the pure confinement spectrum above becomes modified when the gbe hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) is switched on . for the octet states",
    "@xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( @xmath41 shell ) as well as for their first radial excitations of positive parity @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ( @xmath44 shell ) the expectation value of the hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) is @xmath55 . for the decuplet states",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ( @xmath41 shell ) the corresponding matrix element is @xmath59 . in the negative parity excitations ( @xmath43 shell ) in the @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 spectra ( @xmath60 - @xmath61 , @xmath62 - @xmath63 and @xmath64 - @xmath65 ) the contribution of the interaction ( [ 4 ] ) is @xmath66 . the first negative parity excitation in the @xmath48 spectrum ( @xmath43 shell ) @xmath67 - @xmath68 is flavor singlet and , in this case , the corresponding matrix element is @xmath69 .",
    "the latter state is unique and is absent in other spectra due to its flavor - singlet nature .",
    "these matrix elements alone suffice to prove that the ordering of the lowest positive and negative parity states in the baryon spectrum will be correctly predicted by the chiral boson exchange interaction ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath70 may be determined from the n@xmath71 splitting to be 29.3 mev .",
    "the oscillator parameter @xmath72 , which characterizes the effective confining interaction , may be determined as one half of the mass differences between the first excited @xmath73 states and the ground states of the baryons , which have the same flavor - spin , flavor and spin symmetries ( e.g. @xmath51 - @xmath47 , @xmath52 - @xmath48 , @xmath53 - @xmath49 ) , to be @xmath74 mev .",
    "thus the two free parameters of this simple model are fixed and we can make now predictions .    in the @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 sectors the mass difference between the lowest excited @xmath75 states ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ) and @xmath76 negative parity pairs ( @xmath60 - @xmath61 , @xmath62 - @xmath63 , and @xmath64 - @xmath65 , respectively ) will then be @xmath77 whereas for the lowest states in the @xmath48 system ( @xmath52 , @xmath67 - @xmath68 ) it should be    @xmath78    this simple example shows how the gbe interaction provides different ordering of the lowest positive and negative parity excited states in the spectra of the nucleon and the @xmath48-hyperon .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the symmetry properties of the boson - exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "namely , completely symmetric fs state in the @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 positive parity resonances from the @xmath44 band feels a much stronger attractive interaction than the mixed symmetry state in the @xmath60 - @xmath61 , @xmath62 - @xmath63 and @xmath64 -@xmath65 resonances of negative parity ( @xmath43 shell ) .",
    "consequently the masses of the positive parity states @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are shifted down relative to the other ones , which explains the reversal of the otherwise expected `` normal ordering '' .",
    "the situation is different for @xmath67 - @xmath68 and @xmath52 , as the flavor state of @xmath67 - @xmath68 is totally antisymmetric .",
    "because of this the @xmath67 - @xmath68 gains an attractive energy , which is comparable to that of the @xmath52 , and thus the ordering suggested by the confining oscillator interaction is maintained .",
    "note that the problem of the relative position of positive - negative parity states can not be solved with other types of hyperfine interactions ( the colour - magnetic and instanton - induced ones ) .",
    "in the semirelativistic chiral constituent quark model @xcite the dynamical part of the hamiltonian consists of linear pairwise confining interaction and the gbe interaction , which includes both the short - range part , parametrized phenomenologically , of the form @xmath79 , and the long - range yukawa tail . both the flavor - octet ( @xmath80 ) and flavor - singlet ( @xmath13 ) meson exchanges",
    "are taken into account .",
    "the coupling constant of the flavor - octet mesons to constituent quarks is fixed from the known pion - nucleon coupling constant , while the @xmath13-quark coupling constant is treated phenomenologically .",
    "the kinetic - energy operator is taken in relativistic form , @xmath81 .",
    "the semirelativistic three - quark hamiltonian was solved along the stochastical variational method @xcite in momentum space . for the whole q - q potential",
    "the model involves a total of 4 free parameters whose numerical values are determined from the fit to all 35 confirmed low - lying states .",
    "the string tension of the confining interaction can be fixed to that one obtained from charmonium and bottomonium spectroscopy and lattice calculations .    in fig .",
    "1 we present the ground states as well as low - lying excited states in @xmath42 , @xmath46 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath58 spectra . from the results of fig .",
    "1 it becomes evident that within the chiral constituent quark model a unified description of both nonstrange and strange baryon spectra is achieved in good agreement with phenomenology .",
    "it is instructive to learn how the gbe interaction affects the energy levels when it is switched on and its strength is gradually increased ( fig .",
    "2 ) . starting out from the case with confinement only , one observes that the degeneracy of states is removed and the inversion of ordering of positive and negative parity states is achieved in the @xmath42 spectrum , as well as for some states in the @xmath48 spectrum , while the ordering of the lowest positive - negative parity states is opposite in @xmath42 and @xmath48 spectra .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is the flavor - spin structure and sign of the short - range part of gbe .",
    "it is clear that the fock components @xmath82 , and @xmath83 ( including meson continuum ) can not be completely integrated out in favour of the meson - exchange @xmath15 potentials for some states above or near the corresponding meson thresholds .",
    "such components in addition to the main one @xmath84 could explain e.g. an exceptionally big splitting of the flavor singlet states @xmath85 , since the @xmath67 lies below the @xmath86 threshold and can be presented as @xmath86 bound system @xcite .",
    "note , that in the case of the present approach this old idea is completely natural and does not contradict a flavor - singlet @xmath84 nature of @xmath67 , while it would be in conflict with naive constituent quark model where no room for mesons in baryons .",
    "an admixture of such components will be important in order to understand strong decays of some excited states .",
    "while technically inclusion of such components in addition to the main one @xmath84 in a coupled - channel approach is rather difficult task , it should be considered as one of the most important future directions .",
    "what is an intuitive picture of the nucleon in the low - energy regime ? due to some complicated nonperturbative gluodynamics quarks and antiquarks in the nucleon sea are strongly correlated into virtual goldstone bosons . these goldstone bosons in turn couple to valence quarks .",
    "thus the nucleon consists mostly of 3 constituent quarks which are very big objects due to their meson clouds ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . these constituent quarks are all the time in strong overlap inside the nucleon .",
    "that is why the short - range part of gbe interaction ( which is represented by the contact term in the oversimplified representation ( [ 3 ] ) ) is so crucially important inside baryons .",
    "when constituent quarks are well separated and there is a phase space for pion propagation , the long - range yukawa tail of gbe interaction as well as the correlated two - pion exchanges become very important .",
    "it is these parts of meson exchange which produce the necessary long- and intermediate - range attraction in two - nucleon system .",
    "so far , all studies of the short - range @xmath2 interaction within the constituent quark model were based on the one - gluon exchange interaction between quarks .",
    "they explained the short - range repulsion in the @xmath2 system as due to the colour - magnetic part of oge combined with quark interchanges between 3q clusters @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , however , that there is practically no room for colour - magnetic interaction in light baryon spectroscopy and any appreciable amount of colour - magnetic interaction , in addition to gbe , destroys the spectrum @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by recent lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "if so , the question arises which interquark interaction is responsible for the short - range @xmath2 repulsion .",
    "below i show that the same short - range part of gbe which causes e.g. @xmath87 splitting and produces good baryon spectra , also induces a short - range repulsion in @xmath2 system when the latter is treated as 6q system @xcite .    at present",
    "one can use only a simple nonrelativistic @xmath88 ansatz for the nucleon wave function when one applies the quark model to @xmath2 interaction .",
    "thus one needs first an effective nonrelativistic parametrization of gbe interaction which would provide correct nucleon mass , @xmath87 splitting and the nucleon stability with this ansatz . for that one can use the nonrelativistic parametrization @xcite which satisfies approximately the conditions above .    in order to have a qualitative insight into the @xmath2 interaction it is convenient to use an adiabatic born - oppenheimer approximation for the internucleon potential :    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is a collective coordinate which is the separation distance between the two @xmath88 nucleons",
    ", @xmath91 is the lowest expectation value of the 6q hamiltonian at fixed @xmath90 , and @xmath92 is a mass of two well - separated nucleons ( @xmath93 ) calculated with the same hamiltonian .    at the moment we are interested in",
    "what is the @xmath2 interaction at zero separation between nucleons .",
    "it has been proved by harvey that when @xmath94 , then in both @xmath95 and @xmath96 partial waves in the @xmath2 system only two types of orbital 6q configurations survive @xcite : @xmath97_o>$ ] and @xmath98_o>$ ] , where @xmath99_o$ ] is young diagram , describing spatial permutational symmetry in 6q system .",
    "there are a few different flavor - spin symmetries , compatible with the spatial symmetries above : @xmath100_o[33]_{fs}$ ] , @xmath101_o[33]_{fs}$ ] , @xmath101_o[51]_{fs}$ ] , @xmath101_o[411]_{fs}$ ] , @xmath101_o[321]_{fs}$ ] , and @xmath101_o[2211]_{fs}$ ] .",
    "thus , in order to evaluate the @xmath2 interaction at zero separation between nucleons it is necessary to diagonalize a @xmath3 hamiltonian in the basis above and use the procedure ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "from the adiabatic born - oppenheimer approximation ( [ 6 ] ) we find that @xmath102 is highly repulsive in both @xmath95 and @xmath96 partial waves , with the core being of order 1 gev .",
    "this repulsion implies a strong suppression of the @xmath2 wave function in the nucleon overlap region .    due to the specific flavor - spin symmetry of gbe interaction between",
    "quarks the configuration @xmath103_o[51]_{fs}$ ] becomes highly dominant among other possible 6q configurations at zero separation between nucleons ( however , the `` energy '' of this configuration is much higher than the energy of two well - separated nucleons , that is why there is a strong short - range repulsion in @xmath2 system ) .",
    "the symmetry structure of this dominant configuration induces `` an additional '' effective repulsion , related to the `` pauli forbidden state '' in this case , and the s - wave @xmath2 relative motion wave function has a node at short range@xcite .",
    "the existence of a strong repulsion , related to the energy ballance , discussed above , suggests , however , that the amplitude of the oscillating @xmath2 wave function at short range will be strongly suppressed as compared to that one of moscow potential @xcite .",
    "thus , within the chiral constituent quark model one has all the necessary ingredients to understand microscopically the @xmath2 interaction .",
    "there appears strong short - range repulsion from the same short - range part of gbe which also produces hyperfine splittings in baryon spectroscopy .",
    "the long- and intermediate - range attraction in the @xmath2 system is automatically implied by the yukawa part of pion - exchange and correlated two - pion exchanges between quarks belonging to different nucleons . with this first encouraging result",
    ", it might be worthwhile to perform a more elaborate calculation of @xmath2 and other baryon - baryon systems within the present framework .    what will be a short - range interaction in other @xmath104 and @xmath5 systems ? in the chiral limit",
    "there is no difference between all octet baryons : @xmath105 .",
    "thus if one explains a strong short - range repulsion in @xmath2 system as related mostly to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , as above , then the same short - range repulsion should persist in other @xmath104 and @xmath5 systems .",
    "of course , due to the explicit chiral symmetry breaking the strength of this repulsion should be essentially different as compared to that one in @xmath2 system .",
    "one can naively expect that it will be weaker .",
    "assuming that the colour - magnetic interaction is a reason for hyperfine splittings in baryons , jaffe has predicted within the mit bag model that there should be well bound dibaryon in @xmath6 system with @xmath106 , called h - particle @xcite . in this specific case the colour - magnetic interaction in 6q system becomes the most attractive and implies an existence of well - bound dibaryon , stable against @xmath6 strong decay , since it should be well below this threshold .",
    "the h - particle should be a compact object in contrast to molecule - like state of nuclear nature - deuteron .",
    "the quark - cluster calculations which rely on the constituent quark model with a hybrid hamiltonian ( colour - magnetic interaction at short range and meson - exchange at big distances ) confirm this conclusion . with a simple resonating group method variational ansatz they predict h - particle binding energy of order of 20 or even 60 - 120 mev @xcite .",
    "however , a simple variational basis , used in these calculations , is rather poor at short range ( i.e. in 6q region ) .",
    "as soon as it is properly extended , a very deep bound state with binding energy of about 250 mev has recently been found @xcite .    within our approach to baryon structure",
    "the situation is qualitatively different .",
    "we have calculated the `` energy '' of what would be h - particle and found it to be about 800 mev above the @xmath107 threshold @xcite .",
    "it then obviously suggests that there should not be h - dibaryon in nature , if our picture is adequate .",
    "thus the `` h - particle '' channel is not qualitatively different as compared to other two - baryon systems .",
    "this result is easy to anticipate from the symmetry properties .",
    "only if the colour - magnetic interaction is important for the hyperfine splittings , like it is assumed in bag models or in traditional constituent quark model , one could expect that the @xmath108_{cs}$ ] colour - spin symmetry of the compact 6q object ( which is uniquely determined by the flavour - singlet nature of `` h - particle '' ) is energetically more favourable than two well - separated lambdas .",
    "as soon as other physics , like in our case , is responsible for hyperfine splittings in baryons , then the `` h - particle '' channel is not energetically distinguished .",
    "so from this point of view a nonobservation of `` h - particle '' in different experiments , extensively discussed at this conference , gives an additional evidence against the colour - magnetic nature of the hyperfine splittings in light and strange baryons .",
