    "in point - to - point communication , one is usually concerned with minimizing the distortion between the source sequence @xmath0 and the reproduction sequence @xmath1 . in common parlance , we desire necessary and sufficient conditions such that @xmath2\\leq d$ ] . in the language of coordination @xcite , we seek necessary and sufficient conditions such that the empirical distribution of @xmath3 is close to a given @xmath4 in total variation .",
    "both of these notions consider the source sequence and reproduction sequence , but fail to include the channel input and output sequences , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we wish to understand the nature of optimal communication in scenarios where we might want @xmath5 or @xmath6 to be correlated with ( or , coordinate with ) @xmath0 or @xmath1 . to that end ,",
    "we investigate which empirical distributions of @xmath7 can be reliably achieved if we design our encoder and decoder optimally .    [ node distance=1cm , minimum height=7mm , minimum width=14mm , arw/.style=->,>=stealth ] ( source ) ; ( enc ) [ right = of source ] enc . ; ( ch ) [ right = of enc ] @xmath8 ; ( dec ) [ right = of ch ] dec . ; ( mhat ) [ right = of dec ] ;    ( source ) to node[midway , above]@xmath0 ( enc ) ; ( enc ) to node[midway , above]@xmath5 ( ch ) ; ( ch ) to node[midway , above]@xmath6(dec ) ; ( dec ) to node[midway , above]@xmath1 ( mhat ) ;    by understanding which empirical distributions can be achieved in the point - to - point communication problem , including the channel inputs and outputs , we gain insights that extend to network communication problems involving multiple correlated sources . when information sources are correlated and communication occurs over channels with interference , it is useful to take advantage of the correlation and use it to strategically correlate the channel inputs to minimize the effect of the interference .",
    "the point - to - point setting gives us a simple environment to explore the extent with which this is possible and the encoding and decoding techniques needed .    despite the simplicity of the point - to - point setting ,",
    "some interesting technology applications arise .",
    "for example , a media broadcast , such as video , which is designed to accommodate both analog and digital receivers , fits well into this framework .",
    "the most familiar approach in this case is to split the communication resources ( bandwidth or power ) into an analog transmission and a digital transmission , and to take advantage of the analog signal as side information for digital signal ( as in the wyner - ziv setting ) .",
    "however , it is not necessarily optimal to split the communication resources .",
    "a single signal can serve both purposes , and in the context of coordination we want the channel output @xmath6 and the digital reconstruction @xmath1 to each satisfy different distortion constraints . another interesting application is the design of `` systematic '' transmissions , where an analog representation of the source information is designed to be robust to noise .",
    "this fits into our framework  we simply ask for coordination that results in the reconstruction @xmath1 being equal to the channel input @xmath5 .",
    "finally , digital watermarking can also be studied in this coordination framework . in this case , the watermarked media is the channel input , which should obviously be highly correlated with the original media content .",
    "additionally , the watermark @xmath9 should be detectable even if the media is altered in a limited way .",
    "a classic result in information theory is the source - channel separation theorem , which says that if we have designed the optimal source codec and channel codec , then we can minimize average distortion by concatenating the two operations , using `` bits '' as glue . for our problem , however , separation is not good enough .",
    "we draw on recent results on hybrid codes to strictly improve the optimal regions .",
    "hybrid codes combine bits , which are digital entities , with symbol - by - symbol operations , which are analog entities .",
    "these analog / digital combinations have been studied recently in the context of joint source - channel coding for discrete memoryless sources and channels and have been applied to multiuser scenarios in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our problem is closely related to state amplification @xcite .",
    "there , @xmath0 is again given by nature , but the channel is given by @xmath10 , not @xmath8 .",
    "the receiver s goal is to reproduce the state sequence , in contrast to the gelfand - pinsker problem where the receiver wants to identify the sender s message . to use such a channel ,",
    "@xmath5 must be coordinated with @xmath0 ; hence the relevance to our problem .",
    "the relation to state amplification and the gelfand - pinsker problem prompts us to also consider the scenario where the encoder is constrained to be causal .",
    "that is , the input to the channel can only depend on past source symbols , as opposed to depending on the entire source sequence . in both this case and the strictly causal case",
    ", we identify the coordination region , using methods similar to those used in the analysis of causal state amplification in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we are given an i.i.d .",
    "source parametrized by @xmath11 and a memoryless stationary channel parametrized by @xmath8 . the alphabets for source symbols , channel inputs , and channel outputs",
    "are denoted by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively . in accordance with figure  [ figure setup ] , we have at our disposal an encoder and decoder ; depending on the scenario , the encoder might be noncausal , causal , or strictly causal . for block length @xmath15 ,",
    "the encoder and decoder together constitute a code @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are sequences of functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 :",
    "* noncausal encoder : @xmath21 . *",
    "causal encoder : @xmath22 . * strictly causal encoder : @xmath23 . *",
    "decoder : @xmath24 .    in the three cases",
    "above , at time @xmath25 the encoder produces the channel input @xmath26 .",
    "after @xmath15 uses of the memoryless channel , the ( noncausal ) decoder produces @xmath1 according to @xmath27 .",
    "the actions of the encoder and decoder , combined with the nature of the source and channel , give us an induced distribution on @xmath7 .",
    "our model being defined , we can now state the condition for achievability .",
    "a distribution @xmath28 is achievable if for all @xmath29 there exists a block length @xmath15 and a code @xmath16 such that @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the empirical distribution of the tuple @xmath7 induced by the chosen code .",
    "it s not too hard to see that an achievable @xmath28 will necessarily factor like @xmath32 , where @xmath11 and @xmath8 are the given source and channel parameters .",
    "this will be the case because @xmath11 and @xmath8 are given by nature , and by the law of large numbers they will be close to the empirical distributions @xmath33 and @xmath34 for sufficiently large @xmath15 .",
    "we can view proximity in total variation as akin to typicality .    given a distribution @xmath35 ,",
    "the pair @xmath36 is in the @xmath37-typical set @xmath38 if @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the empirical distribution of @xmath36 .",
    "this is not too far from the usual definition of strong typicality . with this definition , we see that achieving @xmath28 is nothing more than ensuring that , @xmath41 , @xmath42 with high probability .",
    "next we define the coordination region , which will be the focus of our results .",
    "the coordination region @xmath43 is the set of achievable @xmath28 .",
    "it is not hard to prove that @xmath43 is a closed , convex set .",
    "we begin with an inner bound on the coordination region for the case of noncausal encoder .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath8 be the given source and channel parameters .",
    "when the encoder is allowed to be noncausal , an inner bound for the coordination region @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 additionally , @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be restricted to functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 instead of general conditional distributions .",
    "this inner bound is a by - product of the achievability scheme for hybrid codes ( see @xcite,@xcite ) . for more discussion on this , see the achievability section below .",
    "the next two theorems give a complete characterization of the coordination region when the encoder is causal or strictly causal .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath8 be the given source and channel parameters . with causal encoder , the coordination region @xmath43 is given by @xmath49 additionally , @xmath45 and @xmath50 can be restricted to functions @xmath47 and @xmath51 instead of general conditional distributions .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath8 be the given source and channel parameters . with strictly causal encoder , the coordination region @xmath43",
    "is given by @xmath52 additionally , @xmath53 can be restricted to be a function @xmath54 instead of a general conditional distribution .",
    "now we consider an example of what can be achieved using hybrid codes that is not achievable using shannon s separation method .",
    "when the encoder is noncausal , applying the separation method yields the following set of achievable distributions : @xmath55 in particular , achievable @xmath28 are required to factor as @xmath56 .",
    "in contrast , theorem 1 allows for greater range of correlation among @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 ; the following is an example of this .",
    "let @xmath11 be @xmath61 and @xmath8 be @xmath62 .",
    "consider a distribution @xmath28 that is consistent with @xmath11 and @xmath8 , and also satisfies @xmath63={\\mathbb{p}}[s\\neq x]=d$ ] .",
    "in other words , we want our reproduction @xmath60 _ and _ our channel input @xmath58 to be close to @xmath57 in hamming distortion .",
    "notice that these conditions do not fully specify the distribution .",
    "we will now see that if @xmath64 , theorem 1 guarantees achievability of @xmath28 .",
    "we make no claims here of necessity , just sufficiency .    to show the claim , choose @xmath58 such that @xmath65=d$ ] and @xmath66 is minimized .",
    "from binary rate - distortion , we know this means @xmath67 . choose @xmath68 and @xmath69 . with these choices",
    ", we see that @xmath70 because @xmath63={\\mathbb{p}}[s\\neq x]=d$ ] .",
    "now we just need to check that @xmath71 .",
    "we can view our situation as @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are independent of @xmath58 .",
    "then we have @xmath76 where @xmath77 is due to @xmath78 and @xmath79 is due to the fact that the entropy of a random variable increases when passed through a binary symmetric channel , in this case @xmath80 .",
    "the proof of achievability for the case of noncausal encoder , obtained by using hybrid codes , comes directly from @xcite , so we will omit it .",
    "however , an illustration of hybrid codes is depicted in figure  [ figure achievability ] .",
    "the main idea is to find an auxiliary @xmath81 sequence that is jointly typical with the source @xmath0 and is part of a sparse codebook that covers @xmath82 .",
    "then the channel input is constructed symbol - by - symbol as a function of @xmath57 and @xmath83 .",
    "this symbol - by - symbol function ( the analog part ) allows for @xmath5 to be correlated with @xmath0 , while the construction of the auxiliary sequence ( the digital part ) takes advantage of compressing the entire source sequence .",
    "the decoder obtains @xmath81 after observing @xmath6 due to the sparsity of the codebook and then constructs @xmath1 symbol - by - symbol from both @xmath59 and @xmath83 .",
    "the achievability schemes for theorems 2 and 3 are very similar to @xcite and @xcite , and we will now provide a sketch of the proof when the encoder is strictly causal ( theorem 3 ) .    .",
    "first , the source sequence is compressed using lossy compression and an auxiliary sequence @xmath81 .",
    "then , the channel inputs @xmath5 are constructed symbol - by - symbol from @xmath0 and @xmath81 .",
    "if properly designed , the decoder is then able to decode @xmath81 from @xmath6 and use both sequences to form the reconstruction @xmath1 . ]",
    "fix @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath54 consistent with an interior point of @xmath43 .",
    "we will use block - markov - like encoding , viewing the source as sequence of blocks : @xmath86 the idea is to compress @xmath87 in the @xmath25th block , using @xmath88 and @xmath89 as side information .",
    "we first cover the source by using at least @xmath90 @xmath91 codewords and assign them randomly to greater than @xmath92 bins ( to first order in the exponent ) . during the @xmath25th block we identify an index @xmath93 such that @xmath94 is jointly typical with @xmath87 and @xmath88 and",
    "then transmit @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the bin index of @xmath94 .",
    "if the number of bins does not exceed @xmath97 and the size of each bin does not exceed @xmath98 , then the decoder will be able to recover @xmath93 by using @xmath88 and @xmath89 as side information . finally , the decoder produces @xmath99 symbol - by - symbol using @xmath54 . under the standard random coding analysis ,",
    "this scheme ensures joint typicality with high probability as long as @xmath100 .",
    "when the encoder is causal ( but not strictly causal ) , the proof is similar , except now we introduce an additional auxiliary random variable @xmath83 that plays the role of @xmath58 in the strictly causal case .",
    "the channel input @xmath5 is produced symbol - by - symbol with a function @xmath101 .",
    "the converses for theorems 2 and 3 are similar ; we show the latter here . to prove the converse for theorem 3 , it is enough to show that for all @xmath102 , there exists a distribution @xmath103 such that    * @xmath104 * @xmath105    then by the closedness of @xmath43 we will be done .",
    "the key to the proof is in the identification of the auxiliary random variables .",
    "we first introduce @xmath106 uniformly distributed on the set @xmath107 , and define @xmath108 .",
    "then we define @xmath109 by setting @xmath110 and @xmath111 . with these choices",
