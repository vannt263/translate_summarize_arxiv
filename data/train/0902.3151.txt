    "` dark energy ' is the name introduced by mike turner , for what had been called the ` @xmath1 term ' , or  ` cosmological term ' in einstein s field equations for more than half a century , a term that had no obvious physical meaning  at least not in the laboratory  but that could not be rejected either from the cosmological field equations if one was looking for the most general second - order equations derivable from a scalar lagrangean . during the last decade , measurements with increasing accuracy of the present average cosmic expansion signalled an increasing expansion rate of the substratum  an acceleration  in obvious violation of energy conservation : an expanding cloud of self - gravitating objects should decelerate .",
    "this misbehaviour of cosmological kinematics urged turner to introduce his cryptic  and even somewhat misleading  name  dark energy  for the @xmath1-term : @xmath1 does not correspond to an energy density because it exerts a negative pressure , forbidden by the classical energy inequalities for laboratory substance ( e.g. kundt 1972 ) ; it is a non - energy , or at best a quasi - energy .",
    "for this reason , it struck me as a salvation of ( serious ) cosmology when i read about david wiltshire s dismissing dark energy ( wiltshire 2007a , b , ellis 2008 ) .",
    "his thesis is simple and convincing : cosmology had hitherto been evaluated wrongly , by ignoring the inhomogeneous distribution of its substratum . we know",
    "shapiro s ` time delay ' effect in the solar system , and in close neutron - star binaries : signals passing close to heavy objects ( stars , galaxies ) reach a distant observer with a certain delay . in the same vein , when we measure cosmic expansion , we use light rays which have propagated through an inhomogenous universe , with voids and walls , sometimes propagating through near - vacuum patches ( voids ) , and sometimes skimming heavy mass concentrations ( clusters of galaxies , in the walls ) . clearly , the formulae derived for a homogeneous cosmological model can not be expected to describe our observations correctly , due to non - linearities .",
    "our local time scale , described by our ( timelike ) worldline , inside our ( massive ) galaxy , has to be referred to the average cosmic timescale via intersections with successive null geodesics lying on past light cones , and connecting us to distant sources in the past .",
    "there is no a priori reason why these two timescales should be the same .",
    "a deviation is expected , an acceleration , whose sign we must calculate , and whose magnitude must likewise be calculated .",
    "it is a cumulative effect , to be obtained by integration over large spacetime distances .",
    "wiltshire has done such calculations , and claims that their result describes the observed seemingly accelerated expansion , without a @xmath1-term in the field equations .",
    "all we have to do is evaluate our observations rigorously .",
    "wiltshire s papers are not easy to read ; they are long .",
    "but fig.1 should do in explaining what he has done : it sketches a significant fraction of our cosmic environment , in an almost metrical ( 1 + 1)-dim spacetime slice through our universe , whose metric is indicated  upto an arbitrary conformal distortion  by a number of past lightcones , with their tips at the center of our local world tube ( of higher than average mass density ) .",
    "these lightcones are steeper when traversing the walls , and shallower in between , because signals propagate more slowly  as sensed by a distant observer  when they move through more densely populated domains than otherwise .",
    "precisely this locally inhomogeneous geometry gives rise to a non - trivial global effect , when measuring our ( average ) past spacetime geometry .",
    "no dark mystery is required for its description .",
    "let me begin this section with a ( 2 + 1)-dim sketch of the spacetime geometry of a forming ( non - rotating ) bh which is assumed to subsequently dissolve again by heating up , radiating , shrinking , and finally exploding .",
    "the bh is assumed to form from an approximately spherical ( supercritical ) mass concentration via collapse under its own gravity .",
    "similar in spirit to fig.1 , fig.2 is drawn in asymptotically ( 2 + 1)-dim minkowskian coordinates , assuming spherical symmetry of 3-space , but metrically distorted near its center in such a way that the causal structure has to be read off the drawn - in local light cones , which point increasingly inward during increasing approach of the symmetry axis of the figure .",
    "this symmetry axis represents the history of the forming bh s center , which at late times  after the bh s assumed complete evaporation  turns again into the center of a minkowskian domain . during collapse ,",
    "the contracting substratum gives off all the higher multipole moments of its mass distribution via radiation ( of both electromagnetic and gravitational waves ) , and contracts deeply inside its ` horizon ' , which is drawn ( in gray ) in the shape of a slowly contracting ( lightlike ) cylinder .",
    "a distant observer sees the surface of the contracting mass concentration until it crosses its horizon .",
    "thereafter , he or she receives the shrinking hole s redshifted evaporation radiation , for a very long time , whose mass decreases slowly  towards @xmath2 g  and whose temperature rises slowly , and eventually peaks abruptly , above @xmath3k , in the form of a final flash , of duration of the order of a second .",
    "this history of a bh just described , and sketched in figs.2,3 , was advocated by stephen hawking in 1974 , and elaborated by him in 1975 , and we all trusted it , throughout the world .",
    "we trusted him and his associates , even though we did not understand the ",
    "highly non - classical  mechanism by which some strongly curved spacetime domain ( around the bh ) could generate outgoing electromagnetic radiation , and cause its enclosed volume to shrink in mass , size , and inverse temperature . only now at this school , 34 years later",
    ", do i learn from belinski ( 2006 ) and leblanc ( 2002 , recited ) that all these expectations may have been premature , and unrealistic . that a bh , should it form ,",
    "will not have a temperature , and will not evaporate .",
    "it will just sit and wait and grow by accretion from its surroundings .    even though in 1975 , i trusted hawking s bh evaporation scenario , i disagreed with him on the meaning of what he called  bh entropy  .",
    "my objections appeared finally in print , in 1976 , with 11 distorting printing errors , and were mostly ignored by the scientific community . in that publication , i compared a forming stellar - mass bh with a forming white dwarf , or neutron star , and showed that all those compact stellar remnants ( under collapse ) had small entropies , smaller than the material from which they had formed , and that hawking s so - called ",
    "bh  entropy  agreed with that of the hole s expected randomized evaporation product ( after some 10@xmath4yr ) , a huge bath of radio waves of wavelength some 20 km .",
    "ever since then , string theorists have been proud of being able to rederive this expression , not worrying about its physical meaning . as constantin tsallis has shown , there exist large classes of functions with the ( reasonable ) positivity and convexity properties of the standard entropy in thermodynamics , though violating additivity ( boon and tsallis , 2005 ; they use the word ",
    "nonextensive  for  non - additive  ) .",
    "hawking s is one of them ; it is quadratic in the bh s mass , not linear",
    ". the relevant thermodynamic formulae will soon follow .",
    "[ sec : dis]before their presentation , it will be helpful to redraw fig.2  in a different ( distorted ) way , leaving the local lightcones at @xmath5 .",
    "such conformally distorted diagrams can map infinity onto finite surfaces ; they leave spacelike surfaces weakly inclined ( @xmath6 ) , and timelike surfaces strongly inclined ( @xmath7 ) w.r.t . the time axis .",
    "fig.3 is a redrawing of fig.2 , but only for ( 1 + 1)-dim meridional sections .",
    "it shows the set of spacelike hypersurfaces @xmath8 for whose material contents i shall calculate the successive entropies @xmath9 contained in them .",
    "note that quantum cosmology proposes yet different expressions  likewise called  entropy   which do not vanish for vanishing particle number densities ( carroll 2008 ) ; i do not understand their physical meaning . they violate the strong equivalence principle .",
    "we are now ready to calculate the relevant entropies @xmath9 .",
    "independently of whether we choose the phenomenological approach of box thermodynamics , with @xmath10 : = ( @xmath11 + @xmath12)/@xmath13 , with @xmath14 standing for internal energy , @xmath15 : = pressure , and @xmath16 : = volume , or the statistical mechanics approach  @xmath17 : = @xmath18 , with @xmath19 : = number of particles , and @xmath20 : = the canonical equilibrium distribution for a homogeneous gas of number density @xmath21 at temperature @xmath22 , the textbooks tell us that @xmath23 holds for a non - quantum , non - relativistic ( hydrogen ) gas whose thermal de broglie wavelength  reads@xmath24 : = @xmath25 @xmath26 = @xmath27 cm @xmath28  with @xmath29 = @xmath29(proton ) . note that for ordinary matter , the entropy density @xmath30 takes small values , between 1 and 90 for non - quantum gases , but always positive , and never very large values ; it can be considered of order unity in astrophysical applications .",
    "this formula can be easily generalized to newtonian gases in a curved spacetime by integrating the entropy density @xmath30 , moving with 4-velocity @xmath31 , over a space section @xmath32 of differential 3-volume  @xmath33 : @xmath34 for a hydrogen mass @xmath35 inside @xmath32 , ( [ integral ] ) yields  @xmath36 = @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath38 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath40 .",
    "these expressions are to be compared with hawking s entropy expression for a non - rotating black hole of mass @xmath35 , ( schwarzschild ) radius @xmath46 = @xmath47 = 10@xmath48 cm ( @xmath49 ) , and temperature @xmath50 which imply an evaporation time @xmath51 for blackbody radiation given by @xmath52 this evaporation time shrinks to @xmath51 = @xmath53sec for @xmath35 shrinking to @xmath54 g , at a bh temperature of @xmath55 = @xmath56k , higher than any ( effective ) temperature reached yet in laboratory experiments , and therefore to be handled with some reservation .",
    "still , order - of - magnitude - wise , it describes the general expectations since the late 70s . hawking s entropy expression for a bh reads : @xmath57 when divided by above entropy ( [ integral ] )  of its constituent hydrogen mass , with @xmath41 @xmath58 , it yields the announced result : @xmath59 in which @xmath60 : = @xmath61 = @xmath62hz stands for the peak frequency of a solar - mass bh s decay radiation .",
    "the huge factor @xmath63 @xmath64 = @xmath65 ( for a solar mass @xmath66 ) measures the number of decay photons generated during the hole s 10@xmath4 years of decay : @xmath65 radio photons for ( the energy of ) one hydrogen atom .",
    "clearly , this huge number has no physical relevance for a newly formed bh , only for its eventual decay product .",
    "as already stated above , this eventual decay product may never form ( leblanc 2002 , belinski 2006 ) , because bhs do not evaporate .",
    "but in the meantime  before this minority opinion has succeeded in replacing the textbook interpretation  above quantitative results can serve as a warning : that untested qft results need not apply .",

    "note that when two objects are fired in opposite directions at relativistic speeds , a distant observer aligned with them will see the blueshifted object for a very short time only  when its flash passes him or her  whilst the redshifted object will stay visible for its whole lifetime .",
    "we thus expect to see many more redshifted knots than blueshifted knots , perhaps 10-times as many ; two blueshifted ones were discussed above .",
    "i see no principle difficulty in identifying a number of high - velocity receding emission - line knots as luminous channel - wall material in receding lobes .",
    "jet plasma is thought to move at large lorentz factors ( @xmath76 , kundt and krishna 2004 ) , and occasionally imposes transrelativistic channel - wall speeds .",
    "redshifts need not always be cosmological .    why have corresponding blueshifted emission lines never been reported , from approaching jets ?",
    "they may be difficult to detect : the knots and heads of the ( relativistic ! ) jets are expected to emit their synchrotron radiation strongly in forward directions , whereas their ( slowly moving ) channel - wall material should radiate almost isotropically .",
    "consequently , redshifted lines should come from a dark sky , whilst blueshifted lines should be superposed on a strong synchrotron continuum .",
    "indeed , the radiation received from the blueshifted hotspots in 3c 33 , pictor a , and others may well be such superpositions : simkin ( 1986 ) , simkin et al ( 1999 ) , tingay et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "an absence of reports need not mean an absence of detections .",
