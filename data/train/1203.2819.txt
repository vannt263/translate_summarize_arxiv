    "further we turn to the causes of the low - temperature dependence of @xmath0 in 2-d graphene sheet through an analytic derivation .",

    "it can be easily verified that @xmath84 in two dimensions is proportional to @xmath76 for the phonon branch with linear dispersion while two - dimensional @xmath84 for the quadratic phonon branch remains to be constant . accordingly , as the phonon frequency tends to zero , the number of vibrational modes expressed by vdos also decreases to zero for branches with the linear phonon dispersion . on the other hand , the number of vibrational modes for the quadratic phonon branch does not change with frequencies . at low temperature ,",
    "only low - frequency phonons mainly contribute to thermal conductance .",
    "therefore , the za phonon branch with the quadratic dispersion makes a dominant contribution to low - temperature thermal conductance due to its constant vibrational density of states .",

    ", the value of convergence agrees well with that of 2d graphene sheet along the corresponding direction , as shown by the open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig2:thermalconductance ] .",
    "such agreement can be explained by the fact that with increasing width phonon dispersion relations of gnrs , especially at low frequencies , are approaching that of 2d graphene sheet as described in the foregoing paragraphs . by contrast , there are some value differences in thermal conductance at high temperatures between gnrs and 2d graphene .",
    "the deviation results from the scattering caused by the confinement from the edges . because of the confinement of standing wave due to the ribbon edges , the phonon dispersion curves tend to be flat at high frequencies , yielding a small group velocity .",
