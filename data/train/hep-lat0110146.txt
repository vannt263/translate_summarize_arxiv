    "it is intuitively clear that for euclidean scalar field theory with quartic interactions , the suppression @xmath2 makes the large field configurations unimportant .",
    "this general idea has been tested explicitly by introducing sharp field cutoffs in models which can be solved numerically .",
    "a first example is the spectrum of the anharmonic oscillator which can be calculated very accurately @xcite by using sturm - liouville theorem and requiring the wave function to vanish at some large value @xmath3 rather than at infinity .",
    "a second example is the calculation @xcite of the zero - momentum correlation functions of dyson s hierarchical model .",
    "this calculations requires the evaluation of the fourier transform of the local measure and a sharp field cutoff can then be introduced at the first iteration , leaving the rest unchanged . in both examples ,",
    "if the field cutoff is taken large enough the errors due to the cutoff can be made exponentially small .",
    "in addition to being a natural procedure in numerical calculations , a large field cutoff cures the lack of convergence of the perturbative series .",
    "it removes the instabilities appearing at negative @xmath1 . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", @xmath4 has a taylor expansion which is _ uniformly _ convergent over the disk @xmath5 and one can then interchange the sum and the integral .",
    "this statement has been checked numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite for the two cases mentioned above .",
    "it was also shown that the modifications to the feynman rules due to the field cutoff could be calculated accurately by using semi - classical methods .",
    "in addition , the errors made at a given order , as a function of @xmath1 and the field cutoff , can be estimated without knowing the numerical answer . at fixed @xmath1 ,",

    "the truncation of @xmath7 at order @xmath8 is accurate provided that @xmath11 . requiring that the peak of the integrand for the @xmath8-th order term is within the range of values of @xmath12 for which the @xmath8-th order truncation provides an accurate approximation , yields the condition @xmath13 .",
