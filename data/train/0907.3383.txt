    "in discussing non - equilibrium processes , it is sometimes important to know time evolutions not only forward in time , but also backward in time .",
    "the typical example is the fluctuation theorems , where several non - trivial exact relations are obtained by using the different behaviors of the forward and backward processes .",
    "there are mainly two different approaches to discuss the fluctuation theorems ; one is the discussion based on deterministic dynamics such as the liouville equation , and the other is the stochastic approach using the langevin equation .    in classical deterministic dynamics ,",
    "both of the forward and backward evolutions in time are determined by the same equation of motion by replacing @xmath0 .",
    "however , we have to remember that the time - reversed processes in stochastic dynamics is not trivial because the simple manipulation , @xmath0 , does not work .",
    "let us , for example , consider the free brownian motion described by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a gaussian white noise .",
    "it is known that this equation describes the diffusion process , where the particle is transfered from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration .",
    "thus the inverse process must be aggregation , which can not be obtained by changing @xmath0 in the above equation . as a matter of fact , as we will see soon later , the time reversed process is described by @xmath3 that is , we need one more equation to set up a stochastic model that describes time - reversed processes .    the purpose of the paper is to investigate the fluctuation theorems of this stochastic model .",
    "as we have mentioned , the time reversed process is important to discuss the fluctuation theorems .",
    "however , as far as we know , this non - triviality of the time - reversed process in stochastic dynamics has not been discussed . for this purpose",
    ", we first generalize the thermodynamic interpretation of stochastic dynamics following the strategy proposed by sekimoto @xcite , and derive the extended thermodynamic relation .",
    "afterwards , we apply our stochastic model to derive the fluctuation theorems , such as the seifert relation @xcite , the jarzynski relation @xcite and the komatsu - nakagawa non - equilibrium steady state @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we introduce our stochastic model . in sec . 3",
    ", we develop the thermodynamic interpretation of the stochastic dynamics following ref .",
    "the various fluctuation theorems are discussed in sec .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a stochastic process @xmath4 described by the following stochastic difference equation , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a force term , @xmath7 , and the noise term satisfies the following properties , @xmath8 here @xmath9 represents an external control parameter such as an external field . the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 characterize the magnitude of the relaxation and the noise , respectively .",
    "we consider that @xmath11 is constant . in the following calculation",
    ", the parameter @xmath10 does not play any important role , and , for the sake of simplicity , we use the special unit of @xmath12 .    to discuss the fluctuation theorems",
    ", we need to define the time reversed process of this stochastic time evolution . in the classical deterministic dynamics where the noise term @xmath13 vanishes",
    ", the time - reversed process is described by replacing @xmath14 with @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ langevin1 ] ) . however , the time reversed process of the stochastic dynamics is not obtained by this simple replacement because of the noise term @xmath13 .    for this purpose ,",
    "we introduce one more stochastic difference equation which describes the stochastic evolution backward in time , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 do not have any correlation .",
    "because @xmath20 is negative , this equation describes the backward process .    from the stochastic equations ( [ langevin1 ] ) and ( [ langevin2 ] )",
    ", we obtain the two fokker - planck equations @xcite , @xmath21 when eq .",
    "( [ langevin2 ] ) describes the time - reversed process of eq .",
    "( [ langevin1 ] ) , the two fokker - planck equations should be equivalent , and consequently , @xmath6 and @xmath22 are not independent anymore . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the two equations are rewritten as @xmath23 where @xmath24 the solution of the second equation is @xmath25 here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are an arbitrary scalar and vector functions , respectively .",
    "we set @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the sake of simplicity .",
    "then @xmath22 is related to @xmath6 by the following relation , @xmath30 it should be emphasized that , as we will see soon later , this relationship is the origin of the fluctuation theorems .",
    "we apply this stochastic model to , for example , the free brownian motion , where the forward stochastic equation of motion is @xmath32 when we assume @xmath33 , the solution of the fokker - planck equation ( [ fp1 ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath34 on the other hand , the backward stochastic equation of motion is given by @xmath35 the force term @xmath36 gives rise to aggregation overcoming diffusion due to the noise @xmath37 .",
    "we checked numerically that the above equation describes the time - reversed process of the free brownian motion ( [ fbm ] ) .",
    "in order to discuss the fluctuation theorems , it is necessary to know the thermodynamic interpretation in our stochastic model .",
    "the thermodynamic interpretation of the stochastic dynamics without time - reversed processes was proposed by sekimoto @xcite . when the stochastic dynamics is given by eq .",
    "( [ langevin1 ] ) , sekimoto proposed the following relation , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the energy of a brownian particle defined by @xmath40 and @xmath41 here , the product @xmath42 means the stratonovich definition of the stochastic product @xcite .",
    "the equation ( [ thermo_seki ] ) is obtained by the stochastic differentiation along the stochastic trajectory @xmath43 . in this sense",
    ", this equation is an identity .",
    "sekimoto assigned the thermodynamic interpretation for the r.h.s .",
    "of the identity ; @xmath44 is the heat which a brownian particle receives from the environment , and @xmath45 is the work which is done to a brownian particle from the environment .",
    "this thermodynamic relation has been studied from various points of view @xcite .    .",
    "we set @xmath46 . ]",
    "however , it is not straightforward to apply this interpretation to our stochastic model .",
    "note that @xmath39 does not have explicit time dependence in sekimoto s definition .",
    "however , in our case , the energy of a brownian particle in the backward process @xmath47 which is defined by @xmath48 , has an explicit time dependence because of the time dependence of @xmath49 ( see eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) ) . to apply sekimoto s procedure to our stochastic model",
    ", we introduce  averaged \" thermodynamic quantities and discuss the thermodynamic relation for these quantities .    note that the force which acts on a brownian particle at @xmath14 is given by @xmath50 for the forward process and @xmath51 for the backward process , as is shown in fig .",

    ". then we can introduce an averaged force which acts on a brownian particle at @xmath14 as @xmath52 correspondingly , the averaged energy is defined as @xmath53    following the discussion by sekimoto , we implement the stochastic differentiation of @xmath54 by using the ito formula and obtain the thermodynamic relation for this averaged thermodynamic quantities as @xmath55 where @xmath56 note that @xmath4 is a stochastic variable , we have to use the ito formula instead of the taylor expansion @xcite . in the derivation of the third equation",
    ", we used the macroscopic current defined from the fokker - planck equation as , @xmath57 one can see that the first two terms on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ ext_ther1 ] ) already appear in sekimoto s thermodynamics relation , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are interpreted as the averaged heat and the averaged work , respectively .",
    "however , the last term does not appear in eq .",
    "( [ thermo_seki ] ) .    in order to clarify the meaning of the new term @xmath60 ,",
    "let us consider the one - dimensional free brownian motion .",
    "then @xmath60 is calculated as @xmath61 it is known that the expectation value of the position of a brownian particle is given by @xmath62 , and one can easily see that @xmath63 vanishes in this case .",
    "thus this term should be interpreted as another heat which a brownian particle receives from the environment ; when @xmath64 moves slower than the average , @xmath63 is positive and a brownian particle recieves heat , and vice versa . apparently from eq .",
    "( [ dqj_def ] ) , this heat appears only when @xmath49 has an explicit time dependence , that is , there is a non - vanishing macroscopic flow @xmath65 .",
    "note that , for the free brownian motion , the energy of the forward process @xmath39 does not exist , but the averaged energy @xmath54 is still finite . by using eqs .",
    "( [ cc ] ) and ( [ dm_brown ] ) , the averaged energy is calculated as @xmath66 then the extended thermodynamic relation ( [ ext_ther1 ] ) for the free brownian motion is explicitly given by @xmath67 the last term on the r.h.s .",
    "comes from @xmath58 , and there is no contribution from @xmath59 in this case .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath63 is re - expressed as , @xmath68 the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "is a total differentiation and may vanish for the total amount of the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "note that @xmath69 defined in eq .",
    "( [ def_b ] ) is the averaged force on a brownian particle and the second term is expressed as the product of the macroscopic current @xmath65 and the microscopic force @xmath69 .",
    "remember that in the irreversible thermodynamics , the entropy production @xmath70 is assumed to be given by the product of an irreversible current @xmath71 and the corresponding thermodynamic force @xmath72 , @xmath73 one can see that the form of the second term of eq .",
    "( [ dwj2 ] ) is very similar to this structure . in a quasi - static process",
    ", we may be possible to identify @xmath74 then the extended thermodynamic relation is rewritten as @xmath75 this is very similar to the generalized thermodynamic relation discussed in the extended irreversible thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the various fluctuation theorems in our stochastic model .",
    "note that the fluctuation theorems based on the stochastic dynamics have already been discussed in several works @xcite .",
    "differently from these works , our fluctuation theorems are expressed in terms of the averaged thermodynamic quantities introduced in the previous section .",
    "now we consider a set of a stochastic trajectory @xmath43 which is described by eq .",
    "( [ langevin1 ] ) .",
    "then , by calculating explicitly the total differentiation of @xmath54 along this trajectory using the ito formula @xcite , we find the following relation , @xmath76 where @xmath77 \\ln \\rho ( { \\bf x}(t),a , t ) dt   + \\partial_a \\ln \\rho ( { \\bf x}(t),a , t ) \\circ da \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sqrt{2\\beta^{-1}}\\nabla \\ln \\rho ( { \\bf x}(t),a , t ) \\cdot d{\\bf w}(t ) .",

    "here we used the following relations , @xmath97 this is the main result , leading to various fluctuation theorems .",
    "the expression ( [ oursei ] ) corresponds to the relation discussed by seifert @xcite , but the expression of @xmath98 is different .",
    "seifert gives the following representation for @xmath98 , @xmath99 thus our exact relation ( [ oursei ] ) is not equivalent to the seifert relation .",
    "the validity of the seifert relation was numerically checked @xcite . however",
    ", our result is also consistent with this numerical result . in @xcite , the stationary state with fixed @xmath9",
