    "since the discovery of quasars ( @xcite ) it has been suggested that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are powered by mass accretion onto a supermassive black hole ( @xmath0 ) with mass in the range @xmath18-@xmath19@xmath20  ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paradigm combined with the observed evolution of agns implies that a significant number of galaxies in the local universe should host a supermassive @xmath0  ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "supermassive @xmath0 s are now detected in @xmath21 galaxies through gas and stellar dynamical methods ( @xcite ) .",
    "some galaxies are quiescent ( e.g.  m32 , @xcite ; ngc 3250 , @xcite ) and some are mildly or strongly active ( e.g.  m87 , @xcite ; centaurus a , @xcite ; cygnus a , @xcite ) .",
    "the mass of the @xmath0  correlates with some properties of the host galaxy such as spheroid ( bulge ) luminosity and mass ( @xcite ) , light concentration ( graham et al . 2001 ) and with the central stellar velocity dispersion ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter correlation was thought to be the tightest but @xcite have recently shown that all the correlations have similar intrinsic dispersion when considering only galaxies with secure bh detections ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "overall , the dispersion is of the order of 0.3 in @xmath22at a given value of @xmath23 , @xmath24  or @xmath25 .",
    "the existence of any correlations of @xmath0  and host galaxy bulge properties has important implications for theories of galaxy formation in general and bulge formation in particular .",
    "indeed , several attempts at explaining the origin of these correlations and the difficulties / constraints that they pose to galaxy formation models can be found in the literature ( e.g.  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "to date , all newly found @xmath0 s have masses ( or upper limits ) in agreement with those expected from the above correlations suggesting that all galaxies host a massive @xmath0  in their nuclei . by applying the correlations between @xmath26  and host galaxy properties",
    "it is then possible to estimate the mass function of local @xmath0 s or , more simply , their total mass density ( @xmath27 ) in the local universe ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to verify if local bh s are exclusively relics of agn activity or if other mechanisms , such as merging , play a role . hereafter",
    "we will call agn relics , or simply relics , those black holes which grew up from small seeds ( 1-@xmath28@xmath20 ) following mass accretion during agn phases . for instance , an agn relic of @xmath29@xmath20  is different from a @xmath0  of the same mass",
    "but which was formed by the merging of many smaller @xmath0 s .",
    "a simple comparison between local and relic bh s was performed by @xcite and @xcite who determined @xmath27  from the observed x - ray background emission .",
    "a revised estimate was obtained by @xcite who found @xmath30 in disagreement with the estimate from local black holes ( @xmath31 , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite thus suggested that , in order to reconcile this discrepancy , massive @xmath0 s should have large accretion efficiencies ( i.e.  larger than the canonically adopted value of @xmath32 ) , hence they should be rapidly rotating .",
    "a more detailed comparison was performed by @xcite who found an agreement between the black hole mass functions ( hereafter @xmath1 ) of local and relic black holes .",
    "recently , however , @xcite and @xcite found a disagreement at large masses ( @xmath33 ) where more agn relics are expected relative to local @xmath0 s .",
    "as previously stated , a possibility to reconcile this discrepancy is to assume high accretion efficiencies but , clearly , this issue is still much debated .",
    "the relation between agn relics and local @xmath0 s is also being studied in the framework of coeval evolution of @xmath0  and host galaxy .",
    "several physical models have been proposed in which the fueling of the @xmath0 , hence the agn activity , is triggered by merging events ( in the context of the hierarchical structure formation paradigm , see for instance @xcite ) or is simply directly related to the star formation history of the host galaxy ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0  has then a feedback on the host galaxy through the energy released in the agn phase ( e.g.  @xcite ) . as a result of this double interaction ( galaxy feeding the bh ",
    "agn feedback on the galaxy ) , these models can in general reproduce both the observed bh - host galaxy correlations and the agn luminosity functions ( e.g. @xcite and previous references ) . however , this big effort in modeling can not uniquely answer the question if local @xmath0 s are relics of agn s , since a wide range of models with many different underlying assumptions can not be ruled out with the available observational constraints .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the assumption that massive black holes in nearby galaxies are relics of agn activity by comparing the local @xmath1  with that of agn relics .",
    "we remark that in this paper we do not build a physical model of the coevolution between central @xmath0  and host galaxy but we compare differential and integrated mass densities ( local @xmath0 s ) with differential and integrated energy densities ( agn s ) , with the only assumption that agn activity is caused by mass accretion onto the central @xmath0 .",
    "we refine the analysis by @xcite and evaluate the discrepancies found by other authors between local and relic @xmath1 s . in section [ sec : lbhmf ]",
    "we estimate the local @xmath1  by applying the known correlations between @xmath26  and host galaxy properties to the galaxy luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion function .",
    "we also check the self - consistency of the results , and show that different @xmath26host - galaxy - properties relations provide the same @xmath1  within the uncertainties . in section [ sec : rbhmf ] we use the continuity equation to estimate the @xmath1  of agn relics and in section [ sec : localrelics ] , we compare local and relic @xmath1 s , and find that local bh s are consistent with agn relics .",
    "we then show ( sec . [ sec : xrb ] ) that the energetic constraints inferred from the x - ray background ( xrb ) are also satisfied and that there is no discrepancy between @xmath27  of local bh s and that expected from the xrb . in sections [ sec :",
    "efflambda ] , [ sec : hist ] , and [ sec : time ] we discuss constraints on the accretion efficiency ( @xmath34 ) and on the eddington ratio ( @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the agn luminosity and @xmath37  is the eddington luminosity of the active bh ) , and we estimate the accretion history and the average lifetime of massive bh s .",
    "we summarize our results and we draw our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the current `` standard '' cosmological model , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .

    "as clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : bhearly]a the effect of including the intrinsic dispersion in the @xmath26-@xmath25  and @xmath26-@xmath48  correlations is that of softening the high mass decrease of the @xmath1 , thus increasing the total density . but",
    "the most important result is that in order to provide the same @xmath1 , the relations @xmath26-@xmath25  and @xmath26-@xmath48  must have the same intrinsic dispersion to within 0.1 in log .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath54 \\sim 2{\\ensuremath{\\rho_\\mathrm{bh}}}[{{\\ensuremath{m_\\mathrm{bh}}}-{\\ensuremath{\\sigma_\\star}}}]$ ] by using @xmath52=0 for @xmath26-@xmath25  and @xmath52=0.5 for @xmath26-@xmath48 .",

    "the densities in massive @xmath0 s were evaluated in the @xmath59 range and the same range will be considered throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "one advantage of using the @xmath26-@xmath25  relation is that the uncertainties on the derived @xmath1  are smaller than in the case of @xmath26-@xmath48 .",
    "this is because with the @xmath26-@xmath25  relation one does not have to apply any correction for the bulge fraction . on the other hand ,",
    "measuring stellar velocity dispersions is much more difficult than measuring galaxy luminosities ; thus it is clear that the two relations @xmath26-@xmath25  and @xmath26-@xmath48  should complement each other .    in summary",
    ", the use of the same intrinsic dispersion for the @xmath26-@xmath25  and @xmath26-@xmath48  relations provides perfectly consistent @xmath1 s with the same mass densities @xmath27 .",
    "this is a confirmation of the results by @xcite who showed that , when considering only secure bh measurements , the @xmath26-@xmath25 @xmath26-@xmath48  and @xmath26-@xmath24  relations have similar intrinsic dispersions ( @xmath60 in log ) .",
    "when not taking into account the intrinsic dispersion of the @xmath26-@xmath25  relation , the local @xmath1  is systematically underestimated at the high mass end , where the disagreement with the @xmath1  of agn relics has been claimed .",
    "having established that both @xmath26-@xmath25  and @xmath26-@xmath48  relations provide consistent @xmath1 s we can now evaluate the effects of using luminosity functions from different galaxy surveys and photometric bands in determining the @xmath1  in early type galaxies .    in fig .",

    "we will first describe the continuity equation which will be used to relate the relic @xmath1 , @xmath72 , to the agn luminosity function @xmath73 , under the assumption that agn are powered by mass accretion onto massive @xmath0 s .",

    "thus , with the @xmath201 distribution estimated by @xcite , the luminosity function has to be multiplied by 1.3 in order to account for the compton - thick agn s . in reality , the correcting factor is luminosity dependent but , since it is limited to the @xmath202 range , we chose an average value for simplicity . with this contribution from compton - thick sources , @xcite are able to provide a reasonable fit of the x - ray background spectrum .",
    "( we will return to this issue in the following section . ) while agn s at @xmath203 are not important contributors of the x - ray background , they do contribute to the relic @xmath1 .",

    "these were obtained by varying the number density of the luminosity function ( @xmath205 @xmath140 error on the number density to avoid correlated errors on the other parameters ) , the hard x - ray bolometric correction ( @xmath206 @xmath140 error on @xmath207 ) , and the factor used to correct for the missing compton - thick agn s ( @xmath208 @xmath140 error ) .",
    "the relic and local @xmath1  agree well within the uncertainties .",

    "local @xmath0 s are thus agn relics and were mainly grown during active phases in the life of the host galaxy .",
    "this agreement has been obtained with @xmath32 and @xmath177 indicating that ( i ) efficiencies higher than commonly adopted for agn s are not required , and ( ii ) the main growth of bh s occurs in phases during which the agn is emitting close to the eddington limit . in section [ sec : efflambda ] we will explore the locus in the @xmath209 plane which is permitted by the comparison from the local and relic @xmath1 s . as discussed in section [ sec : conteq ] we have neglected merging in our estimate of the relic @xmath1 .",

    "for instance , @xmath26  for the farther quasar known ( @xmath288 ) is estimated as @xmath289 ( @xcite ) , and one would expect its local counterpart to be more massive than @xmath287 . however ,",
    "these quasars have not been detected yet and it is not clear if this is because these hypermassive @xmath0 s are very rare or they simply do not exist . in the latter case",
    "there should be a physical reason which prevents a @xmath0  from growing beyond @xmath19@xmath20 , possibly the feedback on the host galaxy mentioned in the previous sections ( see also @xcite ) .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : bhgrowth]b we can also infer a confirmation of what already found in fig .",
    "[ fig : bhgrowth]a , namely that more massive @xmath0 s grow earlier . the symbols in the figure , filled squares , empty squares , and stars , mark the points when a @xmath0  reaches 90% , 50% , and 5%  of its @xmath3 mass , respectively .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath180 all @xmath0 s gain more than 95%  of their final mass but @xmath0 s which are now more massive than @xmath290 had already gained 50%  of their @xmath3 mass at @xmath268 .",
    "conversely , @xmath0 s which have now masses around @xmath291 grew very recently , at @xmath6 .",
    "again , this is a consequence of the luminosity function by @xcite in which the distribution of lower luminosity agn s peaks at @xmath279 .",
    "thus , the luminosity function of @xcite points toward an anti - hierarchical growth of @xmath0 s in the sense that the largest @xmath0 s were formed earlier .",
    "if the correlations between @xmath26and host galaxy properties were valid at higher redshifts ( as is suggested by the results of @xcite ) this would immediately imply that also the most massive galaxies should form earlier , in contrast with the predictions of current semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( see the introduction of @xcite for more details and references ) .",
    "the detection of high mass galaxies in sub - mm surveys is indeed more consistent with the ` monolithic ' scenario in which massive ellipticals form at relatively high redshifts ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "cosmic @xmath0  accretion history compared with the estimate by @xcite and with the cosmic star formation rate by @xcite . ]",
    "the bh accretion history ( i.e.  the total accretion rate at given @xmath110 per unit comoving volume ) can be estimated using eq .",
    "[ eq : mdot ] as @xmath292 \\langle { \\ensuremath{\\dot m}}[m , t(z ) ] \\rangle dm\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : bhgrowth2 ] we plot the cosmic accretion history of @xmath0 s ( computed using the @xcite luminosity function , @xmath32 and @xmath177 ) and we compare it with the estimate by @xcite and with the cosmic star formation rate by @xcite .",
    "our estimate of the cosmic accretion rate onto @xmath0 s agrees well with that by @xcite , likely because most of the high redshift agn s used by @xcite come from the @xcite sample .",
    "differently from us , @xcite estimate the bolometric agn luminosities by integrating the observed spectral energy distributions .",
    "thus the agreement with our analysis should be viewed as a consistency check on the bolometric corrections and on the corrections for obscured agn s that we applied .",
    "the cosmic accretion history has a similar redshift dependence as the cosmic star formation rate , which we report here in the form estimated by @xcite . to aid the eye",
    ", the dashed line represents the estimate of the cosmic accretion history rescaled by 4000 .",
    "the comparison suggests that indeed the two rates have a similar redshift dependence and justifies the assumption that the accretion onto a bh is proportional to the star formation rate , at least at a cosmic level .",
    "this fundamental assumption is made in several models of coeval evolution of @xmath0  and galaxy and , together , with the feedback from the agn explains the observed correlations @xmath26-@xmath25and @xmath26-@xmath48  ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we now estimate the average lifetime of active bh s with the formalism used in this paper and the corrected agn luminosity function by @xcite .    in fig .",

    "hence , objects which are usually classified as ` active ' but which are emitting well below their eddington limit ( e.g.  m87 or centaurus a ) , should not be counted among the active bh s whose fraction is given by the duty cycle .",
    "s more massive than @xmath293 are very rarely active in the local universe ( only 1 out of 10000 ) while they become more numerous at higher redshifts ( by a factor @xmath294 at @xmath295 ) .",
    "conversely , lower mass @xmath0 s are usually a factor 10 more numerous .",
    "a unit duty cycle at @xmath296 is the initial condition assumed for the solution of the continuity equation ( see secs .",

    "[ fig : bhduty]b we plot the average mean lifetime of agn s ( solid line ) as a function of the relic bh mass at @xmath3 computed using the @xcite agn luminosity function and @xmath32 , @xmath177 .",
    "the average lifetime of agn s which leave a relic bh mass of @xmath302 is of the order of 1.5@xmath303@xmath304 , while for smaller relic masses ( @xmath305 ) longer active phases are needed ( @xmath306@xmath304 ) . considering two limiting cases from fig .",
    "[ fig : xrb ] , @xmath307 , and @xmath308 , the average lifetimes can increase up to @xmath309 .",
    "we remark that these numbers are the average lifetimes for @xmath310 with @xmath95=3 .",
    "the derived lifetimes are consistent with the main result from this paper that most of the @xmath0  masses are assembled via mass accretion .",
    "indeed , if a @xmath0  grows by accreting matter with efficiency @xmath34   and emitting at a fraction @xmath9 of its eddington luminosity , its e - folding time is given by @xmath311 , the salpeter time ( @xcite ) , @xmath312^{-1 } \\lambda^{-1}\\ ] ] thus , the initial @xmath0  mass has been e - folded @xmath313 times from @xmath179 for @xmath314 and more than 10 times for @xmath69 .",
    "the apparently long lifetimes are thus the natural consequence of the fact that to grow a @xmath0  from small ( @xmath315 ) or intermediate mass seeds ( @xmath316 , e.g.  @xcite ) several e - folding times must pass easily implying @xmath317 .",
    "for instance , to grow a @xmath0  from @xmath28@xmath20   to @xmath29@xmath20  with @xmath177 and @xmath32 , one would need @xmath318 i.e.  @xmath319 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , in the model by @xcite of coeval evolution of @xmath0  and galaxy , the time needed to grow most of the @xmath0  mass is @xmath320 ( note however that they use @xmath321 , @xmath322 with which the salpeter time is roughly halved with respect to our paper ) .",
    "the reason why the growth of smaller @xmath0 s ( @xmath305 ) requires longer time is not obvious but can be understood from fig .",
    "[ fig : bhgrowth]b .",
    "consider , for instance , @xmath0 s with masses @xmath323 and @xmath324 at @xmath3 .",
    "their average growth history is traced by the lower and upper tracks in the figure .",
    "the larger @xmath0  has @xmath286 at @xmath296 and has to e - fold its mass by 3 times .",
    "conversely , the smaller @xmath0  has @xmath325 at @xmath296 and has to e - fold its mass by at least ten times .",
    "the masses of large @xmath0 s ( @xmath326 ) increase by smaller factors from their @xmath296 values , compared to the masses of smaller @xmath0 s .",
    "thus they require shorter active phases .    in general ,",
    "literature estimates of agn lifetimes range from @xmath18 to @xmath327@xmath304  and are still much uncertain ( see the review by @xcite ) .",
    "models where @xmath0 s grow by a combination of gas accretion traced by short - lived ( @xmath328@xmath304 ) qso activity and merging in hierarchically merging galaxies are consistent with a wide range of observations in the redshift range @xmath329 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however it is not surprising to find a discrepancy with our analysis since we do not consider merging and the @xmath0  growth history that we find is anti - hierarchical .",
    "our estimates agree better with models in which @xmath0 s are mainly grown by gas accretion ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    with an estimate of agn lifetime based on @xmath0  demographics similar to the one presented here @xcite",
    "find @xmath330 for the luminous quasars using the agn luminosity function by @xcite .",
    "the main reason our estimate is larger is that the @xcite luminosity function has a larger number density of objects , which results in longer lifetimes .",
    "indeed , the quasar lifetimes computed using the luminosity function by @xcite are @xmath331 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bhduty]b ) , in agreement with @xcite .    comparing to observational - based estimates ,",
    "the lifetimes from this paper are in agreement with the results from the length of radio jets ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite found from sdss data that a very high fraction of galaxies host an agn ( @xmath332 ) suggesting lifetimes longer than previously thought ( i.e.  @xmath333 ) .",
    "finally , our estimate is in agreement with the upper limit of @xmath309 set by the timescale over which the quasar luminosity density rises and falls ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in summary",
    ", we estimate that local high mass bh s ( @xmath334 ) have been active , on average , @xmath335 . on the contrary",
    ", the assembly of lower mass @xmath0 s has required active phases lasting at least three times that much ( @xmath336 ) .",
    "these average lifetimes can be as large as @xmath337 if one considers the smaller efficiency and fraction of eddington luminosity which are still compatible with local @xmath0 s ( @xmath338 , @xmath185 ) .",
    "we have quantified the importance of mass accretion during agn phases in the growth of supermassive black holes ( @xmath0 ) by comparing the mass function of black holes in the local universe with that expected from agn relics , which are black holes grown entirely during agn phases .",
    "the local @xmath0  mass function ( @xmath1 ) has been estimated by applying the well - known correlations between @xmath0  mass , bulge luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and velocity functions .",
    "we have found that different @xmath0-galaxy correlations provide the same @xmath1  only if they have the same intrinsic dispersion , confirming the findings of @xcite .",
    "the density of supermassive black holes in the local universe is @xmath339 .",
    "the relic @xmath1  is derived from the continuity equation with the only assumption that agn activity is due to accretion onto massive @xmath0 s and that merging is not important .",
    "we find that the relic @xmath1  at @xmath3 is generated mainly at @xmath4 where the major part of @xmath0 s growth takes place .",
    "the relic @xmath1  at @xmath3 is very little dependent on its value at @xmath179 since the main growth of @xmath0 s took place at @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0  growth is anti - hierarchical in the sense that smaller @xmath0 s ( @xmath13 ) grow at lower redshifts ( @xmath6 ) with respect to more massive one s ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "if the correlations between @xmath0  mass and host - galaxy - properties hold at higher redshifts this would represent a potential problem for hierarchical models of galaxy formation .    unlike previous work",
    ", we find that the @xmath1  of agn relics is perfectly consistent with the local @xmath1  indicating the local black holes were mainly grown during agn activity .",
    "this agreement is obtained while satisfying , at the same time , the constraints imposed from the x - ray background both in terms of bh mass density and fraction of obscured agn s .",
    "the reasons for the solution of the discrepancy at high masses found by other authors are the following :    * we have taken into account the intrinsic dispersion of the @xmath26-@xmath25  and @xmath26-@xmath48  correlations in the determination of the local @xmath1 ; * we have adopted the coefficients of the @xmath26-@xmath25  and @xmath26-@xmath48(@xmath44 band ) correlations derived by @xcite after considering only ` secure ' bh masses ; * we have derived improved bolometric corrections which do not take into account reprocessed ir emission in the estimate of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the comparison between the local and relic @xmath1 s also suggests that the merging process at low redshifts ( @xmath4 ) is not important in shaping the relic @xmath1 , and allows us to estimate the average radiative efficiency ( @xmath8 ) , the ratio between emitted and eddington luminosity ( @xmath9 ) and the average lifetime of active @xmath0 s .",
    "our analysis thus suggests the following scenario : local black holes grew during agn phases in which accreting matter was converted into radiation with efficiencies @xmath10 and emitted at a fraction @xmath11 of the eddington luminosity .",
    "the average total lifetime of these active phases ranges from @xmath12 yr for @xmath13 to @xmath14 yr for @xmath15 but can become as large as @xmath16 for the lowest acceptable @xmath17 and @xmath9 values .",

    "<S> we quantify the importance of mass accretion during agn phases in the growth of supermassive black holes ( @xmath0 ) by comparing the mass function of black holes in the local universe with that expected from agn relics , which are black holes grown entirely with mass accretion during agn phases . </S>",
    "<S> the local @xmath0  mass function ( @xmath1 ) is estimated by applying the well - known correlations between @xmath0  mass , bulge luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and velocity functions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that different correlations provide the same @xmath1  only if they have the same intrinsic dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the density of supermassive black holes in the local universe which we estimate is @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the relic @xmath1  is derived from the continuity equation with the only assumption that agn activity is due to accretion onto massive @xmath0 s and that merging is not important . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the relic @xmath1  at @xmath3 is generated mainly at @xmath4 where the major part of @xmath0 s growth takes place . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the @xmath0   growth is anti - hierarchical in the sense that smaller @xmath0 s ( @xmath5 ) grow at lower redshifts ( @xmath6 ) with respect to more massive one s ( @xmath7 ) . unlike previous work </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the @xmath1  of agn relics is perfectly consistent with the local @xmath1  indicating the local black holes were mainly grown during agn activity . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement is obtained while satisfying , at the same time , the constraints imposed from the x - ray background . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between the local and relic @xmath1 s also suggests that the merging process is not important in shaping the relic @xmath1 , at least at low redshifts ( @xmath4 ) , and allows us to estimate the average radiative efficiency ( @xmath8 ) , the ratio between emitted and eddington luminosity ( @xmath9 ) and the average lifetime of active @xmath0 s . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis thus suggests the following scenario : local black holes grew during agn phases in which accreting matter was converted into radiation with efficiencies @xmath10 and emitted at a fraction @xmath11 of the eddington luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the average total lifetime of these active phases ranges from @xmath12 yr for @xmath13 to @xmath14 yr for @xmath15 but can become as large as @xmath16 for the lowest acceptable @xmath17 and @xmath9 values .    </S>",
