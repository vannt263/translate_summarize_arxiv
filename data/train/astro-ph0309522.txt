    "to investigate properties of equilibrium configurations of rotating neutron stars , so far , most neutron star models have been obtained by assuming neutron star matter to be a one - constituent perfect fluid ( for a review , see , e.g. stergioulas 2003 ) .",
    "this treatment of equilibrium states of neutron stars seems to be quite reasonable as a first approximation for examining global properties of neutron stars such as the gravitational mass , the radius , or the maximum rotation frequency .",
    "however , it has long been suggested that neutrons in the inner crust and neutrons and protons in the core of neutron stars are in superfluid states when the interior temperatures cool down below @xmath1 ( e.g. , shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) . since the interior temperature of neutron stars",
    "is believed to cool down quickly via the neutrino emission ( e.g. , baym & pethick 1979 ) , it is likely that each of many observable neutron stars , except newly born ones , has a core containing superfluids .",
    "although superfluidity in the interior might be one of the important ingredients that affect the structures of neutron stars , the superfluidity has been neglected in most studies on equilibrium configurations of rotating neutron stars .",
    "thus , it is necessary to examine how superfluidity affects fundamental properties of rotating neutron stars .",
    "the superfluidity in neutron stars has been mainly argued in connection with the glitch phenomenon and the post - glitch relaxation observed in pulsars .",
    "the glitch is a sudden decrease of an observed pulse period @xmath2 of a pulsar , whose largest magnitude is @xmath3 , that is followed by a period of continuous relaxation . in most explanations of glitch phenomena , a two - component model has been employed to describe rotational dynamics of neutron stars containing superfluid neutrons . in those treatments ,",
    "one of the components is a mixture of the charged particles such as protons ( or ions ) and electrons , which are assumed to co - rotate because the charged components are strongly coupled each other due to short - range electromagnetic interactions ( easson 1979 , alpar et al .",
    "1984 ) , and the other the superfluid neutrons , which are supposed to rotate separately from the charged components because the superfluid neutrons are inviscous and loosely couple to the charged components . in this paper",
    ", we call the mixture of the charged components `` protons '' for brevity .",
    "it has been shown that those two - component superfluid models have succeeded in explaining observed features of the glitches and the post - glitch relaxations qualitatively ( anderson & itoh 1975 ; alpar et al . 1984 ; sedrakian et al . 1995 , link & epstein 1996 ) .",
    "those results mean that the existence of superfluid components inside neutron stars is supported not only from the theory of nuclear physics but also from observations of pulsars .",
    "if they co - rotate , as mentioned in prix & rieutord ( 2002 ) , two constituents in a rotating superfluid star behave as one - constituent ordinary fluid , because the so - called entrainment effect , due to which the momentum of one superfluid constituent is dependent on the mass current of all superfluid constituents , does not operate and two constituents are in a chemical equilibrium state . on the other hand , specific characteristics of neutron stars due to the superfluidity are considered to be observed when two constituents rotate at different rotation rates . to study the effect of rotation velocity difference between two constituents on the global structures of rotating neutron stars with superfluidity , prix ( 1999 ) derived basic equations for the equilibrium configurations and obtained analytical solutions for slowly rotating superfluid stars within the framework of newtonian dynamics , generalizing the so - called chandrasekhar - milne expansion for ordinary fluid stars ( see , e.g. tassoul 1978 ) , in which rotational effects are treated as perturbations to non - rotating spherical stars . to describe dynamics of superfluids",
    ", he made use of a variant of the so - called two - fluid formalism , which had been mainly developed by carter , langlois , and their co - workers ( carter 1989 ; carter & langlois 1998 ; langlois , sedrakian , & carter 1998 ; prix 2002 ) . in order to obtain analytical solutions , prix ( 1999 ) employed an equation of state whose functional form is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the pressure and density , respectively .",
    "more recently , prix , comer , & andersson ( 2002a ) extended the prix formalism so as to include the entrainment effect between two superfluids in order to investigate its effect on the stellar structures . in the same paper , prix et al .",
    "( 2002a ) also argued the effect of the so - called symmetry energy , which can be included as a parameter in the equation of state , and found that the effect of symmetry energy is significant in determination of the density distributions of the neutrons and the protons .",
    "as for relativistic rotating superfluid stars , andersson & comer ( 2001 ) calculated equilibrium configurations of slowly rotating superfluid neutron stars , extending the slow rotation approximation formalism devised by hartle ( 1967 ) ( see , also hartle & thorne 1968 ) for ordinary fluid stars to relativistic two - constituent superfluid stars .",
    "very recently , prix , novak , & comer ( 2002b ) have obtained preliminary results for rapidly rotating superfluid stars , without the slow rotation approximation .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to improve our understanding of properties of equilibrium configurations of rapidly rotating neutron stars with superfluids .",
    "we calculate equilibrium configurations of rapidly rotating neutron stars with neutron and proton superfluids . in this paper",
    ", we are concerned with rotating neutron stars of two superfluids whose angular velocities are different .",
    "we however assume that the rotation velocity difference between two superfluids is very small in comparison with the angular velocity of the star",
    ". this assumption could be reasonable for models of superfluid neutron stars because observations of pulsar glitches show that the rotation velocity of the protons may differ from that of the neutrons , but the amount of the rotation velocity difference is not very large .",
    "we can therefore treat the effect of the rotation velocity difference between two superfluids on the structures of rapidly rotating neutron stars as a small perturbation to equilibrium configurations of rapidly rotating neutron stars in which two superfluids co - rotate .",
    "for the dynamics of superfluids inside stars , we employ a newtonian version of the two - constituent formalism developed by prix ( 2002 ) . in order to obtain basic equations for determining the effect of the rotation velocity difference between two superfluids , equations of superfluid hydrostatic equilibrium and the poisson equation",
    "are expanded in terms of the rotation velocity difference between two superfluids . to obtain the numerical solutions of equilibrium configurations , we make use of a variant of the so - called self consistent field method ( scf ) devised by ostriker & mark ( 1968 ) .",
    "the equation of state for the superfluid we use is the analytical one employed by prix et al .",
    "( 2002a ) , which is a natural extension of an @xmath7 polytropic equation of state for a barotropic ordinary fluid to the case of two superfluids . in ",
    "2 we present the basic equations employed in this paper for the rapidly rotating superfluid stars .",
    "numerical results are given in  3 , and  4 is devoted for summary and discussion .",
    "in this paper , a neutron star is assumed to be composed of superfluid neutrons and a mixture of superfluid protons and normal fluid electrons , because the interior temperatures of old neutron stars are much lower than the transition temperature to neutron and proton superfluids , which is considered to be @xmath8 k ( see , e.g. , epstein 1988 ) .",
    "we further assume that this mixture of charged particles is perfectly in the state of charge neutrality because of strong coupling between the protons and the electrons by electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the electrons therefore co - move with the protons , and their motions can be described with one fluid velocity @xmath9 . through this paper , we call the mixture of the the protons and the electrons `` protons '' for brevity as mentioned before . to describe the dynamics of the superfluids , we make use of the two - constituent formalism for newtonian superfluid dynamics , which has been recently developed by prix ( 2002 ) .    we take account of no `` transfusion '' between the neutrons and the protons .",
    "the particle numbers of the neutron and the proton must be therefore conserved separately .",
    "the particle number conservation equations for the neutron and the proton are then given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the number densities of the neutron and the proton , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the fluid velocities of the neutron and the proton , respectively . here , @xmath15 means the covariant derivative in the three dimensional flat space .",
    "the mass densities of two superfluids can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mass of the neutron , and we assume the mass of the proton to be equal to that of the neutron . the fundamental quantity of the two - constituent formalism for the newtonian superfluid dynamics is the internal energy density @xmath18 , which is a function of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "note that we have neglected the entropy @xmath24 carried by the normal fluid of the electron for simplicity .",
    "this treatment is justified for neutron stars whose internal temperatures are sufficiently low .",
    "this function @xmath18 defines several basic thermodynamical quantities which describe the dynamics of two superfluids in terms of the total difference as follows @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the specific chemical potentials of the neutron and the proton , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath28 represents the strength of the entrainment effect . by using a variant of the gibbs - duhem relation , the generalized pressure of two fluids",
    "is defined by @xmath29 and we can obtain the relation , @xmath30 according to prix ( 2002 ) , the euler equations for two superfluids can be given by @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 . here , @xmath35 means the lie derivative along the vector field @xmath36 .",
    "note that we have considered no direct interaction force between two superfluids such as the mutual friction or the magnus - type force . in equations ( [ euler1 ] ) and ( [ euler2 ] ) ,",
    "the function @xmath37 is the gravitational potential , which is determined with the total mass density @xmath6 , given by @xmath38 , through the poisson equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the gravitational constant .",
    "considering the exterior differentiation of equations ( [ euler1 ] ) and ( [ euler2 ] ) , we can obtain the vorticity equations , given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are , respectively , the exterior derivatives of the one - forms @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which are defined by @xmath46      we consider stationary and axisymmetric equilibrium configurations .",
    "thus , the time and azimuthal derivatives of physical quantities must vanish because a star is assumed to be in a stationary and axisymmetric state .",
    "in this paper , we further assume that the neutrons and the protons , respectively , rotate with the angular velocities @xmath47 and @xmath48 around the axis of rotation , and that no meridional circulation is present in a superfluid star .",
    "the fluid velocities for two fluids are then given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the rotational killing vector .",
    "in this paper , we employ the spherical polar coordinates @xmath51 .",
    "the components of @xmath50 can be written as @xmath52 in the spherical polar coordinates .",
    "first of all , let us consider the vorticity conservation for the flow given by equation ( [ fluid_velocity ] ) .",
    "substituting equation ( [ fluid_velocity ] ) into equation ( [ vorticity ] ) , we obtain @xmath53\\wedge d\\omega_n=0\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath54\\wedge d\\omega_p=0\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the distance from the rotation axis , defined by @xmath56 .",
    "thus , these vorticity conservation equations are automatically satisfied if the rotation laws for two superfluids are given as follows : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are arbitrary functions of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "in other words , the rotation laws of superfluid stars must be strongly restricted because the rotation velocities @xmath47 and @xmath48 may depend on the entrainment functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 , whose functional forms are in general determined with the matter distributions of stars .",
    "when the effect of the entrainment between two superfluids does not operate , that is , the case of @xmath62 or of @xmath63 , the vorticity conservation equations become relatively simple as follows @xmath64 the functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 must not therefore depend on @xmath65 in this situation . in other words , we can choose the rotation velocities @xmath47 and @xmath48 freely as long as @xmath66 and @xmath67 are fulfilled .",
    "note that this condition is the same as that of barotropic ordinary fluid stars . for simplicity , in this paper , we assume that both the neutrons and the protons are uniformly rotating , i.e. @xmath68 and @xmath69 , because vorticity conservations are automatically satisfied for uniformly rotating configurations . assuming the uniform rotations and integrating the euler equations ( [ euler1 ] ) and ( [ euler2 ] )",
    ", we can obtain integrated equations for hydrostatic equilibrium states , given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are integral constants . here , we have used the relationships @xmath73    we are interested in configurations in which two superfluids are rotating rapidly with different angular velocities , @xmath74 .",
    "we do not therefore make use of any slow - rotation approximation such as the chandrasekhar - milne expansion .",
    "we however assume the difference between rotation velocities of two superfluids to be very small .",
    "we can then treat the effect of the angular velocity difference @xmath75 on the stellar structure as a perturbation to rapidly rotating stars whose rotation rates of two superfluids are exactly the same . for superfluid neutron stars , although the angular velocity @xmath47 may differ from the angular velocity @xmath48 because the interaction between two superfluids may be very weak due to the superfluidity , it is believed that this difference between two angular velocities is small in comparison with the averaged angular velocity of the star . thus , this treatment could be appropriate for neutron star models with superfluidity .",
    "we expand physical quantities appeared in equations ( [ poisson ] ) and ( [ beq1 ] ) up to the first order in @xmath76 as follows : @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 are given in terms of partial derivatives of the internal energy density @xmath18 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 by @xmath87 @xmath88 here , quantities following `` @xmath89 '' denote perturbed ones .",
    "note that since we consider the accuracy up to the first order in the rotation velocity difference , no entrainment effects appear in equations we solve . substituting those expanded quantities into equations ( [ poisson ] ) and ( [ beq1 ] )",
    ", we obtain the zero - th order equations , given by @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 equations ( [ eq0 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq0 - 2 ] ) lead to a relationship between chemical potentials of the neutron and the proton @xmath93 in this paper , we take @xmath94 and @xmath95 to be @xmath96 , assuming that the two superfluids are in chemical equilibrium in the unperturbed state .",
    "thus , our basic equations for obtaining unperturbed rapidly rotating stars can be written by @xmath97 on the other hand , the equations for the perturbed quantities are given by @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 in order to solve the poisson equations ( [ eq0 - 3 ] ) and ( [ perturbation - eq3 ] ) , boundary conditions are required .",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions at spatial infinity and at the center of the star are given by @xmath101      in order to obtain equilibrium configurations , the internal energy density @xmath18 must be specified . in this paper",

    "the perturbed densities are shown versus the radial coordinate @xmath218 for six different values of @xmath223 , in which the longest curve corresponds to the result on the equator , @xmath224 , and @xmath223 s decrease for each successively shorter curve toward the value @xmath225 on the symmetry axis . comparing figure 6 ( left panel ) with figure 5 , in which distributions of @xmath219 are shown for the same parameter as those in figure 6 except for the axis ratio @xmath138 or for the rotation velocity @xmath200 , we observe that the basic qualitative properties of the density perturbations for two superfluids do not depend on the value of @xmath200 so much .",
    "we do not therefore show the density distributions for other rotation rates @xmath200 in this paper . from figures 6 through 11",
    ", we can see that the amplitudes of @xmath219 are much larger than those of @xmath220 for the solutions of @xmath194 , while the amplitudes of @xmath219 is smaller than those of @xmath220 for the case of @xmath195 . as shown in figures 9 through 11 , however , for the solutions of @xmath195 ,",
    "difference of the amplitude between @xmath219 and @xmath220 is not so large .",
    "this is because the proton fraction is not very large in the interior .",
    "similar behaviors were found by prix et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "it is also found from figures 6 through 11 that @xmath220 is strongly dependent on the values of @xmath0 for the @xmath194 case , while @xmath219 depends strongly on @xmath0 for the @xmath195 case .",
    "this means that the significant parameters to model a superfluid neutron star are appropriate combinations of the symmetry energy parameter @xmath0 and the velocity difference between two superfluids .    in figures 12 and 13 ,",
    "the perturbed axis ratios are plotted as functions of the angular velocity @xmath200 . here ,",
    "the functions , @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath228 can be interpreted as the perturbations of the axis ratios of the whole star , the neutron superfluid , and the proton superfluid , respectively , and are defined by @xmath229 the results for @xmath194 and @xmath195 are shown in figures 12 and 13 , respectively .",
    "note that in these figures , the perturbed axis ratios are shown for @xmath230 because they diverge as @xmath200 goes to its maximum value .",
    "these figures illustrate how the surface of the star is deform due to the effect of the rotation velocity difference between two superfluids .",
    "it is found that the change of the axis ratio of the rotating component with the slower angular velocity becomes positive when the angular velocity @xmath200 becomes larger than some critical value . in other words ,",
    "the rotating component with the slower angular velocity tends to become prolate when a star rotates very rapidly .    in figure 14 ,",
    "the perturbed mass is shown as a function of @xmath200 . here",

    ", we consider the perturbed states whose central density is the same as that of the unperturbed states .",
    "thus , the mass of the perturbed stars can change . in figures 15 and 16",
    ", we plot the perturbed moments of inertia for the neutron and the proton as functions of the angular velocity @xmath200 . here , the perturbed moments of inertia for the neutron and the proton , @xmath233 and @xmath234 , are defined as @xmath235 figures 15 and 16 show the perturbations of the moments of inertia for @xmath194 and @xmath195 , respectively . in these figures ,",
    "results for three different values of @xmath0 , @xmath236 are displayed .",
    "figures 15 and 16 show that the perturbed moments of inertia for the proton are strongly dependent on the symmetry energy parameter @xmath0 for @xmath194 case , while the perturbed moments of inertia for the neutrons strongly depend on @xmath0 for @xmath195 case .",
    "this is consistent with that of the properties of the density distributions for the neutrons and the protons .",
    "it is noted that amplitudes of @xmath233 and @xmath234 become large as the angular velocity @xmath200 is increased because the perturbations are roughly proportional to @xmath237 due to equation ( [ peq1 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have developed a formulation for constructing and examining rapidly rotating neutron stars that contain two superfluids , taking account of the effect of the rotation velocity difference between two superfluids .",
    "we assumed neutron stars to be composed of the superfluid neutrons and the mixture of the superfluid protons and the normal fluid electrons . to describe newtonian dynamics of the two superfluids , the newtonian version of the two - fluid formalism developed by prix ( 2002 ) was employed . in this paper , we considered the situation where two superfluids rapidly rotate around the same rotation axis , but the rotation velocity difference between two superfluids is very small .",
    "we then treated the effect of the rotation velocity difference on the equilibrium configurations as a small perturbation to rapidly rotating superfluid stars whose rotation velocities of two superfluids are the same .",
    "we derived basic equations for perturbations on the structure of rapidly rotating superfluid stars due to the rotation velocity difference between two superfluids . assuming the superfluids to obey a simple analytical equation of state used by prix et al .",

    "although we only considered one special equation of state for superfluids in the present investigation , the formalism we derived in this paper is straightforwardly applicable to general equations of state .",
    "we treated the superfluids inside neutron stars in the framework of newtonian dynamics .",
    "the effect of general relativity must not be however neglected for the structures of neutron stars because neutron stars are quite compact in a sense that a general relativistic effect can be expressed by the factor @xmath238 whose typical value is @xmath239 for neutron stars , where @xmath240 is the speed of light .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the present formulation to general relativistic configurations and we will do it in the future . recently ,",

    "they did not assume that the rotation velocity difference between two fluids is very small .",
    "in other words , their method can be applied to equilibrium configurations with any rotation velocities . yet",
    ", our perturbation method developed in this investigation has an advantage in studying structures of real neutron stars because it would give results with higher accuracy by taking account of the smallness of the velocity difference directly , as long as the rotation velocity difference between two fluids in real neutron stars is very small .",
    "a solid crust is believed to exist near the surface of cold and old neutron stars , and can have a significant influence on the structure of the equilibrium states if the solid crust is not in a strain - free state in the equilibrium states of rotating neutron stars .",
