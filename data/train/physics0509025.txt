    "movement is one of life s central attributes .",
    "all these  motile  elements generate the forces required for their movements by _ actively _ converting some other forms of energy into mechanical energy",
    ". however , in this review we are interested in a special type of collective movement of these motile elements .",
    "what distinguishes a _ traffic - like _ movement from all other forms of movements is that traffic flow takes place on _",
    "`` tracks '' _ and _ `` trails '' _ ( like those for trains and street cars or like roads and highways for motor vehicles ) for the movement of the motile elements . from now",
    "onwards , the term `` element '' will mean the motile element under consideration .",
    "we are mainly interested in the _ general principles _ and common trends seen in the mathematical modeling of collective traffic - like movements at different levels of biological organization .",
    "we begin at the lowest level , starting with intracellular biomolecular motor traffic on filamentary rails and end our review by discussing the collective movements of social insects ( like , for example , ants and termites ) and vertebrates on trails .",
    "some examples of motile elements and the corresponding tracks are shown in fig.[fig - table ] .",
    "now we shall give a few examples of the traffic - like collective phenomena in biology to emphasize some dynamical features of the tracks which makes biological traffic phenomena more exotic as compared to vehicular traffic .",
    "in any modern society , the most common traffic phenomenon is that of vehicular traffic .",
    "the changes in the roads and highway networks take place over periods of years ( depending on the availability of funds ) whereas a vehicle takes a maximum of a few hours for a single journey .",
    "therefore , for all practical purposes , the roads can be taken to be independent of time while studying the flow of vehicular traffic . in sharp contrast , the tracks and trails , which are the biological analogs of roads , can have nontrivial dependence on time during the typical travel time of the motile elements .",
    "we give a few examples of such traffic .",
    "@xmath0 _ time - dependent track whose length and shape can be affected by the motile element : _ microtubules , a class of filamentary proteins , serve as tracks for two superfamilies of motor proteins called kinesins and dyneins @xcite .",
    "interestingly , microtubules are known to exhibit an unusual polymerization - depolymerization dynamics even in the absence of motor proteins . moreover , in some circumstances , the motor proteins interact with the microtubule tracks so as to influence their length as well as shape ; one such situation arises during cell division ( the process is called _ mitosis _ ) .",
    "@xmath0 _ time - dependent track / trail created and maintained by the motile element : _ a dna helicase @xcite unwinds a double - stranded dna and uses one of the single strands thus opened as the track for its own translocation .",

    "since the pheromone gradually evaporates , the ants keep reinforcing the trail in order to maintain the trail networks .",

    "our aim is to present a critical overview of the common trends in the mathematical modelling of these traffic - like phenomena .",
    "although the choice of the physical examples and modelling strategies are biased by our own works and experiences , we put these in a broader perspective by relating these with works of other research groups .",
    "this review is organized as follows : the general physical principles and the methods of modelling traffic - like collective phenomena are discussed in sections [ sec - approach]-[sec - intra ] while specific examples are presented in the remaining sections .",
    "a summary of the various theoretical approaches followed so far in given in section [ sec - approach ] .",

    "models of traffic of cells , ants and humans on trails are sketched in sections [ sec - cellular ] , [ sec - ants ] and [ sec - ped ] .",
    "the main conclusions regarding the common trends of modelling the traffic - like collective phenomena in diverse systems over a wide range of length scales are summarized in section [ sec - sum ] .",
    "first of all , the theoretical approaches can be broadly divided into two categories : ( i ) `` individual - based '' and ( ii ) `` population - based '' .",
    "the _ individual - based _ models describe the dynamics of the individual elements explicitly .",
    "just as `` microscopic '' models of matter are formulated in terms of molecular constituents , the individual - based models of transport are also developed in terms of the constituent elements .",
    "therefore , the individual - based models are often referred to as `` microscopic '' models .",
    "in contrast , in the _ population - based _ models individual elements do not appear explicitly and , instead , one considers only the population densities ( i.e. , number of individual elements per unit area or per unit volume ) .",
    "the spatio - temporal organization of the elements are emergent collective properties that are determined by the responses of the individuals to their local environments and the local interactions among the individual elements .",
    "therefore , in order to gain a deep understanding of the collective phenomena , it is essential to investigate the linkages between these two levels of biological organization .",
    "usually , but not necessarily , space and time are treated as continua in the population - based models and partial differential equations ( pdes ) or integro - differential equations are written down for the time - dependent local collective densities of the elements .",
    "the individual - based models have been formulated following both continuum and discrete approaches . in the continuum formulation of the lagrangian models , differential equations",
    "describe the individual trajectories of the elements .",
    "suppose @xmath1 is the local density of the population of the motile elements at the coarse - grained location @xmath2 at time @xmath3 .",
    "if the elements are conserved , one can write down an equation of continuity for @xmath1 : + @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the current density corresponding to the population density @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , depending on the nature of the motile elements and their environment , it may be possible to write an analogue of the navier - stokes equation for the local dynamical variable @xmath7 .",
    "however , in this review we shall focus almost exclusively on works carried out following individual - based approaches .      for developing an individual - based model , one must first specify the _ state _ of each individual element .",
    "the dynamical laws governing the time - evolution of the system must predict the state of the system at a time @xmath8 , given the corresponding state at time @xmath3 .",
    "the change of state should reflect the response of the system in terms of movement of the individual elements .",
    "@xmath0 langevin equation :    one possible framework for the mathematical formulation of such models is the deterministic newton s equations for individual elements ; each element is modelled as a `` particle '' subjected to some `` effective forces '' arising out of its interaction with the other elements .",
    "in addition , the elements may also experience viscous drag and some random forces ( `` noise '' ) that may be caused by the surrounding medium . in that case , instead of the newton s equation , one can use a langevin equation @xcite . in case",
    "the element is an organism that can think and take decision , capturing inter - element interaction via effective forces becomes a difficult problem .    for a particle of mass @xmath9 and instantaneous velocity @xmath10 , the langevin equation describing its motion in one - dimensional space",
    "is written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the external force acting on the particle , and @xmath13 is the random force ( noise ) while the second term on the right hand side represents the viscous drag on the particle . in order",
    "that the average velocity satisfies the newton equation for a particle in a viscous medium , we further assume that @xmath14 and @xmath15 where , @xmath16 and , at this level of description , @xmath17 is a phenomenological parameter .",
    "the prefactor @xmath18 on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq - noi2 ] ) has been chosen for convenience .",
    "an alternative , but equivalent approach is to write down what is now generally referred to as a fokker - planck equation @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "one deals with a _ deterministic _ partial differential equation for a probability density .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath19 be the conditional probability that , at time @xmath3 , the motile element is located at @xmath20 and has velocity @xmath21 , given that its initial ( i.e. , at time @xmath22 ) position and velocity were @xmath23 . since the total probability integrated over all space and all velocities is conserved ( i.e , , does not change with time ) , the probability density @xmath24 satisfies an equation of continuity .",
    "the probability current density gets contribution not only from a diffusive motion of the motile elements but also a drift caused by the external force .",
    "often it turns out that real forces ( i.e. , forces arising from real physical interactions ) alone can not account for the observed dynamics of the motile elements ; in such situations , `` social forces '' have been incorporated in the equation of motion @xcite .",
    "however , a priori justification of the forms of such social forces is extremely difficult .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that , in contrast to passive brownian particles , the motile agents are active brownian particles @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 hybrid approaches :    suppose a set of `` particles '' , each of which represents a motile element , move in a potential field @xmath25 $ ] , where the potential at any arbitrary location @xmath26 is determined by the local density @xmath27 of the molecules of a chemical used by the elements for communication among themselves . in the case of ants , for example , such chemicals are generically called `` pheromone '' .",
    "consequently , each `` particle '' experiences an `` inertial''force @xmath28 .",
    "each `` particle '' is also assumed to be subjected to a `` frictional force '' where `` friction '' merely parametrizes the tendency of an element to continue in a given direction : a smaller `` friction '' implies that the element s velocity persists for a longer time in a given direction .",
    "the motion for the `` particles '' is assumed to be governed by the langevin equation @xmath29 + \\eta(t)\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is a gaussian white noise with the statistical properties @xmath31 and @xmath32 the strength @xmath33 of the noise determines the degree of determinacy with which the particle would follow the gradient of the local potential ; the larger the value of @xmath34 the stronger is the tendency of the particle to follow the potential gradient .",
    "thus , the movement of an element may be described as the noisy motion of a particle in an `` energy landscape '' . however , this energy landscape is not static but evolves in response to the motion of the particle as each particle drops a chemical signal ( pheromone ) at its own location at a rate @xmath35 per unit time . assuming that pheromone can diffuse in space with a diffusion constant @xmath17 and evaporate at a rate @xmath36 , the equation governing the pheromone field , in one - dimension ,",
    "is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the local density of the particles at @xmath26 . in order to proceed further , one has to assume a specific form of the function @xmath25 $ ] ; one possible form assumed in the case of ants @xcite is @xmath39 = - \\ln\\biggl(1 + \\frac{\\sigma}{1+\\delta \\sigma}\\biggr)\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is called the capacity .",
    "@xmath0 stochastic cellular automata :    numerical solution of the newton - like or langevin - like equations require discretization of both space and time . therefore , the alternative discrete formulations may be used from the beginning . in recent years many individual - based models ,",
    "however , have been formulated on discretized space and the temporal evolution of the system in discrete time steps are prescribed as dynamical update rules using the language of cellular automata ( ca ) @xcite or lattice gas ( lg ) @xcite .",
    "since each of the individual elements may be regarded as an agent , the ca and lg models are someties also referred to as agent - based models @xcite .",
    "there are some further advantages in modeling biological systems with ca and lg .",
    "biologically , it is quite realistic to think in terms of the way each individual motile element responds to its local environment and the series of actions they perform .",
    "the lack of detailed knowledge of these behavioral responses is compensated by the rules of ca .",
    "usually , it is much easier to devise a reasonable set of logic - based rules , instead of cooking up some effective force for dynamical equations , to capture the behaviour of the elements .",
    "moreover , because of the high speed of simulations of ca and lg , a wide range of possibilities can be explored which would be impossible with more traditional methods based on differential equations .",
    "most of the models we review in this article are based on ca and lg ; this modelling strategy focusses mostly on generic features of the system .",
    "the average number of motile elements that arrive at ( or depart from ) a fixed detector site on the track per unit time interval is called the _",
    "flux_. one of the most important transport properties is the relation between the flux and the density of the motile elements ; a graphical representation of this relation is usually referred to as the _",
    "fundamental diagram_. if the motile elements interact mutually only via their steric repulsion their average speed @xmath10 would decrease with increasing density because of the hindrance caused by each on the following elements . on the other hand , for a given density @xmath41 , the flux @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the corresponding average speed . at sufficiently low density ,",
    "the motile elements are well separated from each other and , consequently , @xmath44 is practically independent of @xmath41 . therefore , @xmath42 is approximately proportional to @xmath41 if @xmath41 is very small .",
    "however , at higher densities the increase of @xmath42 with @xmath41 becomes slower . at high densitits ,",
    "the sharp decrease of @xmath10 with @xmath41 leads to a decrease , rather than increase , of @xmath42 with increasing @xmath41 .",
    "naturally , the fundamental diagram of such a system is expected to exhibit a maxium at an intermediate value of the density .",
    "the _ asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) _ @xcite is a simple particle - hopping model . in the asep particles can hop ( with some probability or rate ) from one lattice site to a neighbouring one , but only if the target site is not already occupied by another particle . `` simple exclusion '' thus refers to the absence of multiply occupied sites .",
    "generically , it is assumed that the motion is `` asymmetric '' such that the particles have a preferred direction of motion .    for a full definition of a model ,",
    "it is necessary to specify the order in which the local rule described above is to be applied to the sites .",
    "the most common update types are _ random - sequential dynamics _ and _ parallel dynamics_. in the random - sequential case , sites are chosen in random order and then updated .",
    "in contrast , updating for the parallel case is done in a synchronous manner ; here all the sites are updated at once .",
    "most often the one - dimensional case is studied , where particles move along a linear chain of @xmath45 sites .",
    "this is rather natural for many applications , e.g.  for modelling highway traffic @xcite .",
    "if motion is allowed in only one direction ( e.g.  `` to the right '' ) , the corresponding model is sometimes called totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) .",
    "the probability of motion from site @xmath46 to site @xmath47 will be denoted by @xmath48 ; in the simplest case , where all the sites are treated on equal footing , @xmath48 is assumed to be independent of the position of the particle .    for such driven diffusive systems the boundary conditions turn out to be crucial .",
    "if periodic boundary conditions are imposed , i.e. , the sites @xmath49 and @xmath45 are made nearest - neibours of each other , all the sites are treated on the same footing . for this system the fundamental diagram has been derived exactly both in the cases of parallel and random - sequential updating rules @xcite ; these are shown graphically in fig.[fig - nsfunda ] .",
    "if the boundaries are open , then a particle can enter from a reservoir and occupy the leftmost site ( @xmath50 ) , with probability @xmath51 , if this site is empty . in this system",
    "a particle that occupies the rightmost site ( @xmath52 ) can exit with probability @xmath34 .",
    "the asep has been studied extensively in recent years and is now well understood ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in fact its stationary state for different dynamics can be obtained exactly @xcite .",
    "it shows an interesting phase diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_asepphase ] ) and is the prototype for so - called boundary - induced phase transitions @xcite .",
    "[ fig_asepphase ] shows the generic form of the phase diagram obtained by varying the boundary rates @xmath51 and @xmath34 .",
    "one can distinguish three phases , namely ( a ) a low - density phase ( @xmath53 ) , ( b ) a high - density phase ( @xmath54 ) and ( c ) a maximal - current phase ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "the appearance of these three phases can easily be understood . in the low - density phase",
    "the current depends only on the input rate @xmath51 .",
    "the input is less efficient than the transport in the bulk of the system or the output and therefore dominates the behaviour of the whole system . in the high - density phase",
    "the output is the least efficient part of the system .",
    "therefore the current depends only on @xmath34 . in the maximal current phase , input and output",
    "are more efficient than the transport in the bulk of the system . here",
    "the current has reached the largest possible value corresponding to the maximum of the fundamental diagram of the periodic system .",
    "mean - field theory @xcite predicts the existence of a shock or domain wall that separates a macroscopic low - density region at the start - end of the chain from a macroscopic high - density region at the stop - end .",
    "the exact solution @xcite , on the other hand , gives a linear increasing density profile .",
    "these two results do not contradict each other since the sharp domain wall , due to current fluctuations , performs a random walk along the lattice .",
    "the mean - field result therefore corresponds to a snapshot at a given time whereas the exact solution averages over all possible positions of the shock .    in @xcite",
    "a nice physical picture has been developed which explains the structure of the phase diagram not only qualitatively , but also ( at least partially ) quantitatively .",
    "it remains correct even for more sophisticated models @xcite .",
    "it relates the phase boundaries to properties of the periodic system which can be derived from the fundamental diagram , namely the so - called shock velocity @xmath57 and the collective velocity @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 is the velocity of a domain - wall which in nonequilibrium systems denotes an object connecting two possible stationary states . here these stationary states have densities @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "the collective velocity @xmath62 describes the velocity of the center - of - mass of a local perturbation in a homogeneous , stationary background of density @xmath6 .",
    "the phase diagram of the open system is then completely determined by the fundamental diagram of the periodic system through an extremal - current principle @xcite and therefore independent of the microscopic dynamics of the model .     at the bottleneck ( partially hatched region ) is smaller than the normal hopping probability @xmath63 , in ( b ) the randomness is associated with the particles ; @xmath64 and @xmath65 being the time - independent hopping probabilities of the particles @xmath66 and @xmath46 , respectively . in ( c ) the randomness arises from the coupling of the dynamics of the hopping particles ( filled circle ) with another species of particles that represent specific type of signal molecules ; the two possible states of the latter are represented by open and filled squares.,title=\"fig : \" ]   at the bottleneck ( partially hatched region ) is smaller than the normal hopping probability @xmath63 , in ( b ) the randomness is associated with the particles ; @xmath64 and @xmath65 being the time - independent hopping probabilities of the particles @xmath66 and @xmath46 , respectively . in ( c ) the randomness arises from the coupling of the dynamics of the hopping particles ( filled circle ) with another species of particles that represent specific type of signal molecules ; the two possible states of the latter are represented by open and filled squares.,title=\"fig : \" ]   at the bottleneck ( partially hatched region ) is smaller than the normal hopping probability @xmath63 , in ( b ) the randomness is associated with the particles ; @xmath64 and @xmath65 being the time - independent hopping probabilities of the particles @xmath66 and @xmath46 , respectively . in ( c ) the randomness arises from the coupling of the dynamics of the hopping particles ( filled circle ) with another species of particles that represent specific type of signal molecules ; the two possible states of the latter are represented by open and filled squares.,title=\"fig : \" ]      at least three different types of randomness of the hopping rates have been considered so far in the context of the asep - type models @xcite .",
    "\\(a ) first , the randomness may be associated with the _ track _ on which the motile elements move @xcite ; typical examples are the bottlenecks created , in intra - cellular transport in neurons , by _ tau _ , a microtubule - associated protein @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneities of some dna and m - rna strands can be well approximated as random @xcite and , hence , the randomess of hopping of the motile elements on the nucleotide - based tracks . as shown schematically in fig.[fig - disorder](a ) , normal hopping probability at unblocked sites is @xmath63 whereas that at the bottleneck is @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "this type of randomness in the hopping probabilities , which may be treated as quenched ( i.e. , time - independent or `` frozen '' ) defect of the track , leads to interesting phase - segregation phenomena ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "\\(b ) the second type of randomness is associated with the hopping _",
    "motile elements _",
    "@xcite , rather than with the track .",
    "for example , the normal hopping probabilities of the motile elements may vary randomly from one element to another ( see fig.[fig - disorder](b ) ) , e.g. , in randomly mutated kinesins @xcite ; the hopping rate of each motile element is , however , `` quenched '' , i.e. , independent of time . in this case , the system is known to be exhibit coarsening of queues of the motile elements and the phenomenon has some formal similarities with bose - einstein condensation ( reviewed in @xcite ) . note that in case of the randomness of type ( a ) , the hopping probability depends only on the spatial location on the track , independent of the identity of the hopping motile element . on the other hand , in the case of randomness of type ( b ) , the hopping probability depends on the hopping motile element , irrespective of its spatial location on the track .",
    "\\(c ) in contrast to the two types of randomness ( ( a ) and ( b ) ) considered above , the randomness in the hopping probabilities of the motile elements in some situations arises from the coupling of their dynamics with that of another non - conserved dynamical variable .",
    "for example , the hopping probability of a motile element may depend on the presence or absence of a specific type of signal molecule in front of it ( see fig.[fig - disorder](c ) ) ; such situations arise in traffic of ants whose movements are strongly dependent on the presence or absence of pheromone on the trail ahead of them . therefore , in such models with periodic boundary conditions , a given motile element may hop from the same site , at different times , with different hopping probabilities .",
    "two extremely idealized mechanisms of motility of single - motors have been developed in the literature .",
    "the _ power - stroke _",
    "mechanism is analogous to the power strokes that drive macrscopic motors . on the other hand , the _",
    "brownian ratchet _",
    "mechanism is unique to the microscopic molecular motors .",
    "let us now consider a brownian particle subjected to a _ time - dependent _ potential , in addition to the viscous drag ( or , frictional force ) .",
    "the potential switches between the two forms ( i ) and ( ii ) shown in fig.[fig - ratgauss ] . the sawtooth form ( i ) is spatially _ periodic _ where each period has an _ asymmetric _ shape .",
    "in contrast , the form ( ii ) is flat so that the particle does not experience any external force imposed on it when the potential has the form ( ii ) .",
    "note that , in the left part of each well in ( i ) the particle experiences a rightward force whereas in the right part of the same well it is subjected to a leftward force .",
    "moreover , the spatially averaged force experienced by the particle in each well of length @xmath69 is @xmath70 because of the spatially periodic form of the potential ( i ) .",
    "what makes this problem so interesting is that , in spite of vanishing average force acting on it , the particle can still exhibit directed , albeit noisy , rightward motion .    in order to understand the underlying physical principles ,",
    "let us assume that initially the potential has the shape ( i ) and the particle is located at a point on the line that corresponds to the bottom of a well .",
    "now the potential is switched off so that it makes a transition to the form ( ii ) .",
    "immediately , the free particle begins to execute a brownian motion and the corresponding gaussian profile of the probability distribution begins to spread with the passage of time . if the potential is again switched on before the gaussian profile gets enough time for spreading beyond the original well , the particle will return to its original initial position .",
    "but , if the period during which the potential remains off is sufficiently long , so that the gaussian probability distribution has a non - vanishing tail overlapping with the neighbouring well on the right side of the original well , then there is a small non - vanishing probability that the particle will move forward towards right by one period when the potential is switched on . in the case of cytoskeleton - based motors like kinesin and dynein ,",
    "this energy is supplied by the hydrolysis of atp molecules to adp ; thus , the mechanical movement is coupled to a chemical reaction .    in this mechanism , the particle moves forward not because of any force imposed on it but because of its brownian motion .",
    "the system is , however , not in equilibrium because energy is pumped into it during every period in switching the potential between the two forms . in other words ,",
    "the system works as a rectifier where the brownian motion , in principle , could have given rise to both forward and backward movements of the particle in the multiples of @xmath69 , but the backward motion of the particle is suppressed by a combination of ( a ) the time dependence and ( b ) spatial asymmetry ( in form ( i ) ) of the potential .",
    "in fact , the direction of motion of the particle can be reversed by replacing the potential ( i ) by the potential ( iii ) shown in fig.[fig - ratbidir ] .",
    "the spatial asymmetry of the sawtooth potential arises from the polar nature of the microtubule and actin filamentary tracks .",
    "the mechanism of directional movement discussed above is called a brownian ratchet @xcite .",
    "the concept of brownian ratchet was popularized by feynman through his lectures @xcite although , historically , it was introduced by smoluchowski @xcite .",
    "effects of quenched ( i.e. , time - independent ) disorder on the properties of brownian ratchets have been considered by several authors @xcite .",
    "quenched disorder can arise in brownian ratchets , for example , from + ( i ) random variation of the heights ( or depths ) of the sawtooth potential from one site to another where all the sawteeth have the same type of asymmetry , + ( i ) a random mixture of forward and reversed sawteeth where the heights of all the sawteeth is identical .",
    "the nature of disorder in real molecular motors , even if driven by a brownian - ratchet mechanism , may be a combination of these two types of idealized disorder .",
    "suppose @xmath71 is the frequency of both the transitions from ( i ) to ( ii ) and ( ii ) to ( i ) forms of the potential .",
    "also , let @xmath72 be the probability of finding a defect , i.e. , a reversed sawtooth in case ( ii ) . in that case , the effective drift and effective diffusion coefficient exhibit three different regions on the @xmath73 phase diagram @xcite including some anomalous behaviour .",
    "helicases and polymerases are the two classes of nucleotide - based motors that have been the main focus of experimental investigations . in this section ,",
    "we discuss only the motion of the ribosome along the m - rna track . historically , this problem is one of the first where tasp - like model was successfully applied to a biological system .",
    "the synthesis of proteins and polypetids in a living cell is a complex process .",
    "special machines , so - called _ ribosomes _ , translate the genetic information ` stored ' in the _ messenger - rna ( mrna ) _ into a program for the synthesis of a protein .",
    "mrna is a long ( linear ) molecule made up of a sequence of triplets of nucleotides ; each triplet is called a _",
    "codon_. the genetic information is encoded in the sequence of codons . a ribosome , that first gets attached to the mrna chain , `` reads '' the codons as it moves along the mrna chain , recruits the corresponding amino acids and assembles these amino acids in the sequence so as to synthesize the protein for which the `` construction plan '' was stored in the mrna .",
    "after executing the synthesis as per the plan , it gets detached from the mrna . thus , the process of `` translation '' of genetic information stored in mrna consists of three steps : ( i ) _ initiation _ : attachment of a ribosome at the `` start '' end of the mrna , ( ii ) _ elongation _ : of the polypeptide ( protein ) as the ribosome moves along the mrna , and ( iii ) _ termination _ : ribosome gets detached from the mrna when it reaches the `` stop '' codon .",
    "let us denote each of the successive codons by the successive sites of a one - dimensional lattice where the first and the last sites correspond to the start and stop codons .",
    "the ribosomes are much bigger ( 20 - 30 times ) than the codons .",
    "therefore , neighbouring ribosomes attached to the same mrna can not read the same information or overtake each other .",
    "in other words , any given site on the lattice may be covered by a single ribosome or none .",
    "let us represent each ribosome by a rigid rod of length @xmath74 .",
    "if the rod representing the ribosome has its left edge attached to the i - th site of the lattice , it is allowed to move to the right by one lattice spacing , i.e. , its left edge moves to the site @xmath75 provided the site @xmath76 is empty . in the special case",
    "@xmath77 this model reduced to the tasep .",
    "although the model was originally proposed in the late sixties @xcite , significant progress in its analytical treatment for the general case of arbitrary @xmath78 could be made only three decades later ; even the effects of quenched disorder has also been considered in the recent literature @xcite .    as mentioned above ,",

    "[ fig - flux ] shows fundamental diagrams for the two relevant cases @xmath176 and @xmath159 and different values of the evaporation probability @xmath111 for equal densities on both lanes . in both cases the unusual behaviour related to a non - monotonic variation of the average speed with density as in the uni - directional model",
    "can be observed @xcite .",
    "an additional feature of the fundamental diagram in the bi - directional ant - traffic model is the occurrence of a plateau region .",
    "this plateau formation is more pronounced in the case @xmath159 than for @xmath176 since they appear for all values of @xmath111 .",
    "similar plateaus have been observed earlier @xcite in models related to vehicular traffic where randomly placed bottlenecks slow down the traffic in certain locations along the route .",
    "the experimental data available initially @xcite were not accurate enough to test the predictions mentioned above . however , more accurate recent data @xcite exhibit non - monotonic variation of the average speed with density thereby confirming our theoretical prediction .",
    "one of the interesting open questions , which requires careful modelling , is as follows : how does a forager ant , which gets displaced from a trail , decides the correct direction on rejoining the trail ?",
    "more specifically , an ant carrying food should be nest - bound when it rejoins the trail to save time and to minimize the risk of an encounter with a predator . in other words , do the pheromone trails have some `` polarity '' ( analogous to the polarity of microtubules and actin , the filamentary tracks on which the cytoskeletal motors move ) ? on the basis of recent experimental observations , it has been claimed @xcite that the trail geometry gives rise to an effective polarity of the ant trails .",
    "however , other mechanisms for polarity of the trails are also possible .",
    "although there are some superficial similarities between the trafic - like collective phenomena in ant - trails and the pedestrian traffic on trails , there are also some crucial differences . at present , there are very few models which can account for all the observed phenomena in completely satisfactory manner .",
    "we present only a brief overview of the collective effects and self - organization ; for a more comprehensive discussion , see ref.@xcite .",
    "* jamming * : at large densities various kinds of jamming phenomena occur , e.g.when the flow is limited by a door or narrowing .",
    "therefore , this kind of jamming does not depend strongly on the microscopic dynamics of the particles , but is typical for a bottleneck situation .",
    "it is important for practical applications , especially evacuation simulations .",
    "furthermore , in addition to the flow reduction , effects like arching @xcite , known from granular materials , play an important role .",
    "jamming also occurs where two groups of pedestrians mutually block each other .",
    "* lane formation * : in counterflow , i.e.  two groups of people moving in opposite directions , a kind of spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_oszi]a ) .",
    "the motion of the pedestrians can self - organize in such a way that ( dynamically varying ) lanes are formed where people move in just one direction @xcite . in this way ,",
    "strong interactions with oncoming pedestrians are reduced and a higher walking speed is possible .",
    "a ) b )    * oscillations * : in counterflow at bottlenecks , e.g.  doors , one can observe oscillatory changes of the direction of motion .",
    "once a pedestrian is able to pass the bottleneck it becomes easier for others to follow in the same direction until somebody is able to pass ( e.g.  through a fluctuation ) the bottleneck in the opposite direction ( see fig .  [",
    "fig_oszi]b ) .",
    "* patterns at intersections * : at intersections various collective patterns of motion can be formed .",
    "short - lived roundabouts make the motion more efficient since they allow for a `` smoother '' motion .",
    "* panics * : in panic situations , many counter - intuitive phenomena can occur . in the faster -",
    "is - slower effect @xcite a higher desired velocity leads to a slower movement of a large crowd .",
    "understanding such effects is extremely important for evacuations in emergency situations .",
    "several different approaches for modelling the dynamics of pedestrians have been proposed , either based on a continuous representation of space or on a grid .",
    "the earliest models of pedestrian dynamics belonged to the population - based approaches and took inspiration from hydrodynamics or gas - kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "however , it turned our @xcite that several important differences to normal fluids are important , e.g. the anisotropy of interactions or the fact that pedestrians usually have an individual preferred direction of motion .    later several individual - based approaches in continuous space and time have been proposed . in the social force models",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) and other similar approaches @xcite pedestrians are treated as particles subject to repulsive forces induced by the social behaviour of the individuals .",
    "this leads to ( coupled ) equations of motion similar to newtonian mechanics .",
    "there are , however , important differences since , e.g. , in general the third law ( `` actio = reactio '' ) is not fulfilled .",
    "furthermore a two - dimensional variant of the optimal - velocity model @xcite has also been suggested .",
    "active walker models @xcite have been used to describe the formation of human or animal trails etc . here",
    "the walker leaves a trace by modifying the underground on his path .",
    "this modification is real in the sense that it could be measured in principle . for trail formation",
    ", vegetation is destroyed by the walker .    in @xcite a kind of mesoscopic approach inspired by lattice gas models @xcite has been suggested .",
    "thus the exclusion principle is relaxed and the dynamics is based on a collision - propagation scheme .",
    "most cellular automaton models for pedestrian dynamics proposed are rather simple @xcite and can be considered as two - dimensional generalizations of the asep ( see sec .",
    "[ sec - asep ] ) . however , these models are not able to reproduce all the collective effects described in the preceeding subsection .",
    "the same is true for more sophisticated discrete models @xcite .    in the following we discuss a promising new approach , the _ floor field model _ @xcite , for the description of pedestrian dynamics in more detail which is takes inspiration from the ant trail model of sec .",
    "[ sec - ants ] .",
    "the interaction in this model is implemented as virtual chemotaxis which allows to translate a long - ranged spatial interaction into a local interaction with `` memory '' .",
    "guided by the phenomenon of chemotaxis the interactions between pedestrians are thus local and allow for computational efficiency .",
    "pedestrians are modelled as particles that move on a two - dimensional lattice of cells .",
    "each cell can be occupied by at most one particle which reflects that the interactions between them are repulsive for short distances ( private sphere ) .",
    "particles can move to one of the neighbouring cells based on certain transition probabilities that are are determined by three factors : ( 1 ) the desired direction of motion , ( 2 ) interactions with other pedestrians , and ( 3 ) interactions with the infrastructure ( walls , doors , etc . ) .",
    "first of all , basic transition probabilities are determined which reflect the preferred walking direction and speed of each individual in the form of a matrix of preferences @xmath9 which can be related to the preferred velocity vector and its fluctuations @xcite .",
    "next interactions between pedestrians are taken into account .",
    "the exclusion principle accounts for the fact that one likes to keep a minimal distance from others .",
    "however , for larger distances the interaction is assumed to be attractive to capture the advantage in following the predecessor .",
    "this is implemented by virtual chemotaxis . moving particles",
    "create a `` pheromone '' at the cell which they leave , thus creating a kind of trace , the _ dynamic floor field _",
    "it has its own dynamics given by diffusion and decay @xcite which leads to a dilution and finally the vanishing of the trace after some time .    for a unified description another floor field",
    "is introduced , the _",
    "static floor field _",
    "it is constant and takes into account the interactions with the infrastructure , e.g.  preferred areas , walls and other obstacles .",
    "the transition probabilities given by the matrix of preference @xmath180 are now modified by the strengths of the floor fields @xmath181 and @xmath182 in the target cell @xmath183 ; the details are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "due to the use of parallel dynamics it might happen that two ( or more ) pedestrians choose the same target cell .",
    "such a situation is called a _",
    "conflict_. due to hard - core exclusion , at most one persons can move . introducing a friction parameter @xmath184 @xcite , with probability @xmath184 _ all _ pedestrians remain at their site , i.e. nobody",
    "is allowed to move . with probability @xmath185 one of the individuals",
    "is chosen randomly and allowed to move to the target cell .",
    "the effects of @xmath186 are similar to those arising from a moment of hesitation when people are about to collide and try to avoid the collision .",
    "the details of the update rules can be found in @xcite ; this floor field model has been able to reproduce the empirically observed phenomena listed earlier in this section .",
    "another interesting phenomenon which has been studied successfully using the floor field model is the evacuation from a large space with only one exit @xcite .",
    "however , this is beyond the scope of this review as we restrict our attention here mostly on traffic - like flow properties .",
    "nevertheless the application of such models in the planning stages of large buildings , ships or aircrafts has become increasingly important over the last years .",
    "the simplicity and realism of the models allows to optimize evacuation and egress processes already in an early stage of the construction without the necessity of performing potentially dangerous experiments .",
    "because of restrictions imposed by the allowed length of the review , we have excluded several biological traffic phenomena where , to our knowledge , very little progress has been made so far in theoretical modelling of the processes .",
    "these include , for example , + ( i ) _ bidirectional transport _ along microtubules where the same cargo moves along the same microtubule track using sets of opposing motors @xcite ; + ( ii ) _ self - organized patterns _ like , for example , _ asters _ and _ vortices _ , which have been in several in - vitro experiments @xcite and model calculations @xcite    in this article we have reviewed our current understanding of traffic - like collective phenomena in living systems starting from the smallest level of intra - cellular transport and ending at the largest level of traffic of pedestrians .",
    "so far as the theoretical methods are concerned , we have restricted our attention to those works where the language of cellular automata or extensions of tasep has been used .",
    "the success of this modelling strategy has opened up a new horizon and , we hope , we have provided a glimpse of the exciting frontier .    *",
