    "quantum phase transition ( qpt ) , which is driven by quantum fluctuation and occurs at zero temperature , is a very important research area recently @xcite . besides the static properties of qpt",
    ", the non - equilibrium dynamics induced by the quench of the parameter in the hamiltonian through a critical point has always been an attractive topic in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , a dynamical evolution can be induced by either a sudden quench or a slow quench .",
    "taking the spin chain in the magnetic field as an example , the typical paradigm of sudden quench is as follows . initially ( @xmath0 ) the magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "then at time @xmath2 the magnetic field is changed to @xmath3 suddenly , namely @xmath4 and the system begins to evolve from the initial state .",
    "after a long enough time evolution , the time - averaged expectation value of an observable @xmath5 reaches a steady value , which we define as quench @xmath5 .",
    "quench @xmath5 is @xmath6 @xcite , with @xmath7 the expectation value of observable @xmath5 at time @xmath8 with initial magnetic field @xmath9 and final magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "one can fix @xmath3(@xmath9 ) to investigate the relation between quench @xmath5 and @xmath9(@xmath3 ) .",
    "the magnetization @xmath10 and its derivative with respect to magnetic field @xmath11 of transverse ising model are analyzed in ref .",
    "it is found that @xmath11 has similar behavior for static system and sudden quench system . here",
    "interesting questions arise : why does this similarity happen and whether other quantities still exhibit such similarity ?    in this work ,",
    "we start from a general hamiltonian @xmath12 containing a controllable parameter @xmath13 to search for the answers .",
    "we obtain a general conclusion that in a sudden quench system , when the final hamiltonian is fixed , the behavior of the time - averaged expectation of any observable has close relationship with the gapless excitation of the initial hamiltonian .",
    "there is a similarity between the critical phenomena of sudden quench and static system .",
    "then we numerically investigate the sudden quench properties of two - spin correlation of an anisotropic xy chain in a transverse field @xcite .",
    "the results are consistent with our conclusion .",
    "we also research the long - range correlation of the system in both directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "there is no qualitative difference between static and sudden quench case in the direction parallel to the magnetic field , but a remarkable difference exists in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field , which is consistent with the result in ref.@xcite . at last , we briefly discuss the case in which initial hamiltonian is fixed .",
    "here we consider a general hamiltonian @xmath14 which contains a controllable parameter @xmath13 .",
    "we suppose the ground state of @xmath12 is non - degenerate and with the varying of @xmath13 the system can undergo a qpt happening at @xmath15 , where the energy gap of @xmath12 vanishes in the thermodynamics limit ( tl ) .",
    "this is the case for many condensed matter systems , especially for spin chains .",
    "for example @xmath16 and @xmath13 is the magnetic field for transverse ising model .",
    "now we try to derive the singular behavior of the time - averaged expectation value of any observable @xmath5 when qpt happens , both for static case and sudden quench case . at time @xmath0 , @xmath17 and",
    "the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath18 are denoted as @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively . at zero temperature",
    "the system is in the ground state of this initial hamiltonian @xmath18 , namely @xmath21 .",
    "therefore for static case , which means @xmath17 for @xmath22 , the the time - averaged expectation value is just @xmath23 . by the perturbation theory , we know @xmath24 with @xmath25 , so @xmath26 which leads to @xmath27}{e_{0}(a)-e_{m}(a)}\\label{e4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] straightforwardly , where @xmath28 means the real part of a complex number @xmath29 .",
    "one can expect that @xmath30 will behave singularly at @xmath31 because the energy gap vanishes in tl .",
    "if at time @xmath2 , @xmath13 is suddenly changed to @xmath3 and @xmath32 is kept for @xmath33 , the system will evolve under sudden quench .",
    "the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the final hamiltonian @xmath34 are denoted as @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "the time - evolving wave function of the system at @xmath33 is @xmath37 , where we omit the relative phase .",
    "the time - averaged expectation value is @xmath38 so we have    @xmath39 . \\label{e5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when @xmath40 , the numerator in the above eq.([e5 ] ) is not zero .",
    "therefore @xmath41 will show singularity at @xmath31 because of the vanishing of the energy gap in tl .",
    "however if @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 , so in eq.([e5 ] ) @xmath44 . considering @xmath45 in the sum , we can see both the numerator and denominator in eq.([e5 ] ) are zero at @xmath46 , meaning that @xmath47 maybe has no singular behavior at @xmath31 .",
    "because eqs.([e4 ] ) and ( [ e5 ] ) share the same denominator , we conclude that there must be similarity between the critical singular behaviors of @xmath30 and @xmath41 .",
    "the singularity and scaling behaviors come from the vanishing of the energy gap of the initial hamiltonian in tl .",
    "if there is a critical phenomenon of the initial hamiltonian with a vanishing energy gap which can be indicated by the singular behavior of @xmath30 at @xmath31 , @xmath41 will also have a similar singular behavior at @xmath31 if @xmath48 .",
    "in this paper , we use the anisotropic xy model in a transverse field under a sudden quench at zero temperature to check our conclusion in the above section .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spin-1/2 anisotropic xy spin chain is @xmath49-h(t)\\sigma_{j}^{z}\\big\\},\\nonumber \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the coupling constant , @xmath51 are the pauli operators at the @xmath52th lattice site and @xmath53 is the measure of the interaction strength in @xmath54 component between two nearest - neighbor spins .",

    "@xmath58 is the time - dependent magnetic field . in our paper",
    ", we set @xmath59 for convenience and the periodic boundary condition @xmath60 is used .",
    "the phase diagram of this model is easy to be obtained .",
    "there are two kinds of phase transition in anisotropic xy spin chain model .",
    "one belongs to the universality class of the ising phase transition and the other is anisotropic transition @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the ising phase transition .",
    "the equilibrium ising phase critical points are @xmath61 . in @xmath59 case , the system has anti - ferromagnetic interaction with the staggered magnetization in the @xmath62 direction @xmath63 as the order parameter . for @xmath64 ,",
    "the system is in an ordered phase with @xmath65 , while for @xmath66 , the system is in a disordered phase with @xmath67 .",
    "now we turn to the problem of dynamics under sudden quench . using successive jordan - wigner , fourier , and bogoliubov transformations , the exact solutions of the evolved state of xy model under a sudden quench",
    "can be obtained @xcite , by which the quench dynamical properties of many observables such as magnetization and two - spin correlation can be studied . in our work",
    "we focus on the quench two - spin correlation , which is defined as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the distance between two spins and @xmath9 ( @xmath3 ) is the initial ( final ) magnetic field .",
    "as the beginning we want to clarify our conclusion in sec.ii by considering @xmath71 , namely the nearest - neighbor two - spin correlation . due to the difficulty in the analytical calculation of them , we choose to numerically solve them .",

    "similar to @xmath84 , @xmath85 diverges at @xmath75 for static and sudden quench case .",
    "after numerical analysis , we can find @xmath86 , with @xmath87 a constant which we do not concern with ( fig.[f9](b ) ) .",
    "we also can see from fig.[f9](a ) that @xmath88 is not divergent at @xmath75 .    through the comparison between static and sudden quench cases of xy model",
    ", we find that in general sudden quench case ( @xmath89 ) , the quench system and static system share similar critical scaling form of @xmath71 .",
    "this is consistent with our conclusion in sec.ii and reflects the memory of the quench system to the initial hamiltonian .    .",

    "( b ) @xmath90 as a function of @xmath83 .",
    "one can see the slopes of the lines for different @xmath3 are all the same , namely a universal constant @xmath91 . ]",
    "now we shift our focus from the nearest - neighbor two - spin correlation to the correlation between two spins with arbitrary distance @xmath70 .",
    "we show @xmath92 as a function of @xmath9 and @xmath70 for both static and sudden quench case in fig.[f5 ] , where @xmath93 is used . from this figure",
    ", we know as @xmath70 increases , @xmath92 reaches a constant quickly after a little increase of @xmath70 .",
    "there is no qualitative difference between static and general dynamical case .    .",
    "@xmath92 for ( a ) the static case @xmath94 , ( b ) @xmath95 , ( c ) @xmath78 and ( d ) @xmath96 . ]    .",
    "@xmath97 in ( a ) static system and dynamical systems with ( b ) @xmath98 , ( c ) @xmath78 and ( d ) @xmath99 . ]     at @xmath98 up to @xmath100 .",
    "through numerical fit of the two typical data @xmath101 and @xmath102 , we find @xmath103 , with @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we extrapolate those two curves to @xmath106 . ]    for @xmath97 , there will be a big difference .",
    "we let @xmath72 for convenience here . in a static system ( @xmath107 ) , from fig.[f7](a ) we can see when @xmath108 , @xmath109 tends to zero very quickly and is nonzero only if @xmath70 is very small , demonstrating no long - range correlation in @xmath62 direction . while in another phase @xmath110 , the ground state is degenerate and possesses long - range correlation in @xmath62 direction . however , in a sudden quench system , the case will be obviously different . if the final magnetic field @xmath111 , after a long time evolution the long - range correlation in @xmath62 direction only exists at the point @xmath112 ( that is just the static case ) , meaning that when @xmath111 a change of magnetic field at @xmath2 will eliminate the long - range correlation in @xmath62 direction . in fig.[f7](b ) , we plot the @xmath97 up to @xmath100 with @xmath98 . through numerical fit of the two typical data @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( fig.[f8 ] ) , we find @xmath113 , decaying to zero with @xmath70 even when @xmath9 and @xmath3 is slightly different .",
    "so we think the @xmath114 is destroyed after an arbitrarily small quench . while @xmath115 , no matter what @xmath9 is , even for @xmath110 , there is no long - range correlation in @xmath62 direction .",
    "this means that there is a possibility that a system possessing a long - range correlation in @xmath62 direction at the beginning will lose it after a long enough time evolution ( fig.[f7](d ) ) .",
    "so , only when static case @xmath112 , the long - range correlation in @xmath62 direction is preserved . in other cases we can have when @xmath116 , @xmath117 , leading to @xmath118 straightforwardly .",
    "a physical intuition tells us that because the magnetic field is in the @xmath29 direction , the long - range correlation in the @xmath29 direction can survive after the quench but the long - range correlation in the @xmath62 direction is destroyed by the quench .",
    "we note that the long range correlation is also researched by sengupta _",
    "et al_. in ref.@xcite .",
    "they give some analytic results of the two point correlation function perpendicular to the magnetic field direction in quantum ising model .",
    "however , they only consider two limit cases , namely the initial magnetic field is fixed at @xmath119 and @xmath120 . in both cases , @xmath114 tends to zero when @xmath116 but in different ways which depend on the value of the final magnetic field @xmath3 . in fig.[f7 ] , one can see that @xmath121 tends to zero much slower than @xmath122 and there is a clear spatial oscillation of @xmath123 .",
    "these phenomena are consistent with ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore , our numerical results confirm their analytic results about long range correlation and give an extension to the general situation beyond the two limit cases .",
    "up to now we only consider the case in which the final magnetic field @xmath3 is fixed and all quench quantities are regarded as functions of initial magnetic field @xmath9 . for completeness",
    ", we discuss the case in which @xmath9 is fixed and all quench quantities are regarded as functions of @xmath3 . as one can expect , the quench quantities will have different behaviors .",
    "if we make a similar calculation with that in sec.ii using perturbation theory , we can obtain    @xmath124\\nonumber\\\\ & + & 2\\sum_{n}\\sum_{m\\neq n}\\frac{\\langle \\psi_{0}(a)|\\phi_{n}(b)\\rangle\\langle \\phi_{n}(b)|\\psi_{0}(a)\\rangle}{\\omega_{n}(b)-\\omega_{m}(b)}\\times\\re[(h_{i})_{nm}\\langle \\phi_{m}(b)|a|\\phi_{n}(b)\\rangle ] . \\label{ee}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is difficult to study the behavior of eq.([ee ] ) near @xmath125 for a general @xmath9 .",
    "however , the case in which @xmath31 is easy to analyze .",
    "when @xmath126 , @xmath127 . therefore in the first term of the right hand side of eq.([ee ] ) ,",
    "@xmath128 , meaning that this term is 0 because @xmath129 in the sum .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath130 in the second term of eq.([ee ] ) .",
    "so we have @xmath131}{\\omega_{0}(\\lambda_c)-\\omega_{m}(\\lambda_c)}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation is the same with eq.([e4 ] ) and means that @xmath132 will diverge at @xmath133 because the vanish of the energy gap .    in the following we use @xmath134 as an example to analyze",
    "( see fig.[f10 ] ) . as we expect above",
    ", @xmath135 is divergent at @xmath78 when @xmath75 . while @xmath136 , it is discontinuous at @xmath78 . how to explain the discontinuity is still an open question to us .    .",
    "@xmath134 with fixed initial magnetic field @xmath137 . ]",
    "in summary , starting from a general hamiltonian which may undergo a qpt with the change of a controllable parameter , we obtain a general conclusion that in a sudden quench system , when the final hamiltonian is fixed , the behavior of the time - averaged expectation of any observable has close relationship with the gapless excitation of the initial hamiltonian .",
    "this general conclusion , clarified by our example of xy model , to a large extent explains the similarity between the critical phenomena of sudden quench and static system .",
    "the long - range correlation is also studied and we find that sudden quench can destroy long - range correlation in the @xmath62 direction . as we know , the one - spin reduced density matrix can always be written as @xmath138 .",
    "if considering symmetry breaking effects in xy chain @xcite , we can not suppose @xmath139 .",
    "therefore for static case it will be a complex task to solve @xmath140 .",
    "but for sudden quench , @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
    "so our result can help to simplify the calculation of one ( two)-site reduced density matrix .",
    "this will be useful in studying the entanglement of one site with others for xy model .",
    "in addition , the general conclusion can be useful for other quantities and other models .",
