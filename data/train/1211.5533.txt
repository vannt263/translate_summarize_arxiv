    "the polymer translocation through narrow pores is one of the most striking single - molecule experiments motivated mainly by the dna transport across cell membranes and the possibility of dna sequencing@xcite . in nearly two decades of intensive investigations",
    "considerable headway has been achieved by a variety of experimental , theoretical and simulational studies@xcite . in most cases of experimental and simulation studies one deals with a polymer chain that is driven by external electrical field which acts on the monomers passing through the nanopore from the _",
    "cis_- to the _ trans_-side of the separating membrane @xcite .",
    "some of the very basic questions one tries to answer concern the time @xmath12 it takes the chain to thread and translocate between the two half - spaces of the setup and in particular , how @xmath12 depends on chain length @xmath9 and applied force @xmath2 .",
    "the simplest theoretical approach has considered this process as one - dimensional biased diffusion ( in terms of the translocated number of segments @xmath13 ) over an entropic barrier @xcite .",
    "such an approach obviously suffers from some inconsistency since the mean time of the driven translocation @xmath14 turns to be smaller than the relaxation ( rouse ) time of the chain @xmath15 so that the chain has not enough time to equilibrate and experience the global entropic barrier .",
    "later , it was realized that the chain responds to pulling at first locally in the vicinity of the nanopore with a tensile force spreading away from the separating membrane .",
    "this scenario has been treated within the linear response theory ( that is , for relatively weak driving forces ) and the corresponding memory function has been derived explicitly @xcite . for arbitrary strong driving forces ,",
    "an interesting approach based on the notion of tensile force propagation along the chain backbone has been suggested by sakaue @xcite .",
    "sakaue s idea has been used and worked out very recently in other theoretical treatments @xcite .    despite increased insight in the nature of the translocation process , however , current understanding of the translocation dynamics is still far from satisfactory .",
    "so , among other things , there exists a non - negligible systematic discrepancy between the theoretical ( analytical ) predictions concerning the main scaling exponents that characterize translocation dynamics and the data provided by computer experiments , mainly molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation studies @xcite .    recently @xcite we suggested a theoretical description based on the tensile ( pincus ) blob picture of a pulled chain and the notion of a tensile force propagation , introduced by sakaue @xcite .",
    "assuming that the local driving force is matched by a drag force of equal magnitude , ( i.e. , in a quasi - static approximation ) , we derived an equation of motion for the tensile front position .",
    "this enables one to calculate the deterministic dependence ( i.e. , without taking into account fluctuations ) of the translocation coordinate as a function of time @xmath16 .",
    "one can obtain the scaling law for the mean translocation time @xmath8 vs. chain length @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath10 , where @xmath7 is the translocation exponent .",
    "the total translocation process consists of two stages .",
    "first , the tensile force propagates so that more and more polymer segments get involved in the moving domain . depending on the driving force @xmath2 , which is applied to the segment in the pore , the moving domain attains different shapes : `` trumpet '' , `` stem - trumpet '' , or a `` stem '' , for weak , intermediate and strong forces , respectively .",
    "once the last polymer segment on the _ cis_-side of the pore gets involved , the velocity of the moving domain approaches a stationary value .",
    "after that the second stationary stage sets in and the rest of the chain is sucked into the pore with constant velocity .    we have shown @xcite that for the `` trumpet '' case , the characteristic duration ( in the case of rouse dynamics ) of the first and second stages goes as @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively ( where @xmath19 is the flory exponent ) , so that at @xmath20 the first stage time dominates . as a consequence , with growing chain length @xmath9 and",
    "force @xmath2 , the translocation exponent @xmath7 also increases from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "these predictions are supported by our simulation findings @xcite as well as by results of lehtola _ et al . _",
    "@xcite but differ from the results of luo _ et al",
    ". _ @xcite .",
    "the tensile force propagation phenomenon treated within the iso - flux trumpet model also leads to @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the md - simulation results yield systematically smaller values for the translocation exponent @xmath7 . for example , in our md - simulations @xmath24 for strong forces and @xmath25 for weak forces ( distinct from the theoretical predictions @xmath22 , and @xmath26 respectively ) .",
    "it is important to determine the origin of this inconsistency since apparently there is something missing in the afore mentioned theoretical consideration which gives room for speculations .",
    "for example , in a paper by ikonen et at .",
    "@xcite , the model based on the idea of tensile force propagation @xcite and the role of pore - polymer friction has been numerically investigated .",
    "the authors argue that the theoretical value for the exponent , @xmath23 , may be seen only for very long chains whereas for the chain lengths used in real experiments or simulations the effective exponent @xmath7 could be approximately 20% smaller .    in this work we consider theoretically and by means of md - simulations how fluctuations of the translocation coordinate (",
    "such fluctuations have been ignored in the quasi - static approximation as in the other deterministic treatments ) affect the forced translocation dynamics . indeed",
    ", the role of thermal fluctuations is by no means self - evident .",
    "a recent publication @xcite argues that only fluctuations related to the initial distribution of segments are essential whereas thermal fluctuations have a minor effect .",
    "moreover , the authors argue @xcite that the translocation exponents are not affected by the fluctuations in the initial conditions .    in the present investigations",
    "we demonstrate that thermal fluctuations may facilitate the translocation dynamics so that the effective translocation exponent @xmath7 becomes smaller . to this end in section",
    "[ theory ] we derive a fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) for the translocation coordinate @xmath13 probability distribution function @xmath27 .",
    "this fpe , which contains a nonlinear drift term and a time - dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath4 , is then solved numerically demonstrating a significant fluctuation - induced facilitation of the translocation dynamics . in section [ sim ] we then present our simulation results .",
    "first , we prove that the translocation velocity under differently strong driving forces is a random process with a gaussian distribution which is the only conjecture we need for our theory .",
    "then we calculate the velocity autocorrelation function ( vaf ) which reveals an oscillatory behavior and a long - time tail .",
