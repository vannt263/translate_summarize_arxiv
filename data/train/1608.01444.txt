    "the above discrepancy has been discussed in several new physics models  @xcite including the supersymmetry ( susy ) models  @xcite . in susy , it has been argued that isospin - violating contributions from gluino box diagrams can be responsible for the discrepancy  @xcite . in this letter",

    "they do not decouple even if susy particles are heavy as long as a product of the mass insertion ( mi ) parameters @xmath13 is fixed  @xcite .",
    "this feature is attractive once other constraints are considered .",
    "for instance , although cp - violating fcncs of the @xmath7 meson are tightly constrained by the indirect cp violation of the @xmath7 meson or electric dipole moments , susy contributions to them decouple in heavy susy scenarios .",
    "thus , the discrepancy may be explained by the chargino contributions to the @xmath2 penguin in @xmath0 .    among the constraints , one should pay attention that the vacuum stability condition is not relaxed even if susy particles are heavy .",
    "since the mi parameters , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are proportional to scalar trilinear couplings , the chargino @xmath2-penguin contributions are constrained by requiring the stability of the electroweak ( ew ) vacuum . in the literature ,",
    "charge - color breaking ( ccb ) vacua or potential directions unbounded from below ( ufb ) have been studied along with @xmath0  @xcite . however , their analyses follow the strategy of ref .",

    "although the soft susy - breaking masses , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , generally have flavor off - diagonal components , they are irrelevant for the current discrepancy of @xmath0 , because susy contributions to the @xmath2 penguin are enhanced when the su(2)@xmath22 symmetry is broken , as will be mentioned in the next section .",
