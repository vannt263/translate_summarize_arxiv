    "high - energy heavy - ion collision experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite have conclusively established the formation of a strongly interacting quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the qgp formed in these collisions exhibit strong collective behaviour , and therefore can be studied within the framework of relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "the hydrodynamical analyses of the flow data suggests that the qgp behaves like a nearly perfect fluid with an extremely small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "local pressure gradients due to deformations and inhomogeneities in the the initial stages of the collision results in anisotropic fluid velocity .",
    "these anisotropies subsequently translate into flow harmonics describing the momentum asymmetry of produced particles @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 of the fluid governs the conversion efficiency , which results in a suppression of elliptic flow and higher order flow coefficients @xcite .",
    "apart from hydrodynamics , the observables pertaining to collective behaviour of qgp can also be studied using the so - called blast - wave model . using a simple functional form for the phase - space density at kinetic freezeout , schnedermann _ et .",
    "approximated hydrodynamical results with boost - invariant longitudinal flow @xcite .",
    "they used this blast - wave model to successfully fit the transverse momentum spectra with only two parameters : a kinetic temperature , and a radial flow strength .",

    "_ generalized this model to account for the anisotropies in the transverse flow profile by introducing an additional parameter .",
    "this new parameter controlled the difference between the strength of the flow in and out of the reaction plane .",
    "this lead to a fairly good fit with the measured elliptical flow as a function of transverse momentum .",
    "however , the star collaboration achieved better fits when they generalized the model even further by introducing a fourth parameter to account for the anisotropic shape of the source in coordinate space @xcite .",
    "teaney made the first attempt to estimate the effect of viscosity on elliptic flow using a variant of the blast - wave model model .",
    "however , the centrality dependence of the fit parameters left the model with little predictive power .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the blast - wave model to include viscous effects by employing a viscosity - based survival scale for geometrical anisotropies , formed in the early stages of relativistic heavy - ion collisions , in the parametrization of the radial flow velocity .",

    "we use this viscous blast - wave model to obtain the transverse momentum distribution of particle yields and flow harmonics for lhc .",
    "the blast - wave model parameters are fixed by fitting the transverse momentum spectra of identified particles .",
    "subsequently , we show that this leads to fairly good agreement with transverse momentum distribution of elliptic and triangular flow for various centralities as well as centrality distribution for integrated flow .",
    "we estimate the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath0 at the lhc , within the present model .",
    "the blast - wave model has been used extensively to fit experimental data and it provides good description of spectra and elliptic flow observed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the previously used blast - wave models employ a simple parametrization for the flow velocity of boost invariant ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "the most important feature is the parametrization of the transverse velocity which is assumed to increase linearly with respect to the radius .",
    "this parametrization is found to be in agreement with hydro results @xcite .",
    "this essentially leads to an exponential expansion of the fireball in the transverse direction , hence the term blast - wave . apart from boost invariance",

    "the momentum space asymmetries are not hydrodynamic variables and are only affected indirectly via damping . on the other hand , the acoustic damping should be applicable to hydrodynamic variables and it should only capture the viscous effects of the hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "this assumption also misses the additional effect of viscosity at freeze - out using the cooper - frye formula .",
