    "supernovae ( sne ) and their remnants play a crucial role in driving the dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxies ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "each sn produces bulks of heavy elements and disperses them throughout the interstellar medium ( ism ) ( e.g. thielemann et al .",
    "1996 ; chieffi & limongi 2004 ) .",
    "the shock waves from the sn explosions may also trigger star formation in molecular clouds ( boss 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , the blast waves in supernova remnants ( snrs ) can accelerate particles to relativistic energies via fermi - i acceleration ( reynolds 2008 ) , which has long been suggested as a promising acceleration mechanism for galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) .",
    "for investigating the role of snrs as gcr accelerators , it is necessary to ask whether they can account for the entire energy density of crs in the milky way .",
    "this is related to the mechanical power provided by the sne , which in turn is associated with their event rate . in our milky way ,",
    "the currently known snr population is far below the expectation based on a event rate of 2 sne / century ( tammann et al .",
    "1994 ) and a typical evolution timescale of @xmath1  yrs ( see hui et al . 2012 ; hui 2013 ) .",
    "therefore , deeper searches for galactic snrs are certainly needed .",
    "+ with the much improved spatial and spectral resolution and enlarged effective area , state - of - the - art x - ray observatories like chandra and xmm - newton provide powerful tools for studying the shock - heated plasma and the non - thermal emission from the leptonic acceleration in snrs ( hui 2013 ; kang 2013 ) .",
    "however , the number of x - ray detected snrs is still significantly smaller than the corresponding number of detections in the radio . until now there are 302 snrs that have been uncovered in the milky way : 274 objects recorded in green ( 2009 ) plus 28 objects reported in ferrand & safi - harb ( 2012 ) , while the number of galactic snrs detected in x - rays is about 100 .",
    "therefore , enlarging the sample of the x - ray detected snrs would be valuable .",
    "recently , we have initiated an observational campaign for searching and identifying new galactic snrs with x - ray telescopes ( hui et al .",
    "2012 ) . here",
    "we report our detailed x - ray analysis of the another snr candidate g38.71.4 .",
    "+ g38.71.4  was first detected as an unidentified object in rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) with an extent of about @xmath2 .",
    "this object has a centrally - peaked morphology in x - rays .",
    "cross - correlating with the effelsberg galactic plane 11  cm survey data , g38.71.4  is found to positionally coincide with an incomplete radio shell ( cf .",
    "figure  1d in schaudel et al . 2002 ) .",
    "a follow - up observation with the effelsberg telescope at a wavelength of 6  cm revealed a non - thermal radio emission with a spectral index of @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , the existence of polarization in the radio shell was reported by schaudel et al .",
    "all these evidences suggest that g38.71.4  is very likely to be a snr with center - filled x - ray ( mixed ) morphology .",
    "however , the poor spatial resolution ( @xmath4 \" ) and the limited photon statistic ( @xmath5 source counts ) of rass data do not allow one to unambiguously confirm its physical nature .",
    "furthermore , the limited energy bandwidth of rosat ( 0.1 - 2.4  kev ) does not allow one to determine whether a possible hard x - ray ( @xmath62  kev ) component , arising from the interactions of the reflected shocks with the dense ambient medium or alternatively from the synchrotron emission radiated by relativistic leptons , is present in the hard x - ray band .",
    "this motivates us to carry out a detailed x - ray studies of g38.71.4  with xmm - newton and chandra .",
    "+ considering the composition of gcrs , leptons only constitute a small proportion . a large fraction of the observed gcrs are hadrons ( i.e proton and heavy ions ; cf .",
    "sinnis et al . 2009 ) .",
    "due to the large masses of hadrons , they are not efficient synchrotron emitters .",
    "x - ray and radio observations are generally difficult to constrain their presence . on the other hand , the collision of relativistic hadrons can lead to the production of neutral pions which can subsequently decay into @xmath7rays ( caprioli 2011 ) . for complementing the aforementioned x - ray investigation of g38.71.4  as a possible acceleration site of gcrs ,",
    "we have also conducted a search for @xmath7ray emission at the location of g38.71.4  wtih the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the fermi gamma - ray space telescope .",
    "+ in this paper , we report a detailed high energy investigation of g38.71.4 .",

    "sections 3 and 4 present the results of the x - ray spatial and spectral analysis respectively . in section 5",
    ", we describe a deep search of @xmath7ray emission with fermi .",
    "finally , we discuss the physical implications of the results and summarize our conclusions in sections 6 and 7 respectively .",

    "pn instruments were operated in full - frame mode using the medium filter to block optical stray light .",
    "all the data were processed with the xmm - newton science analysis software ( sas ) package ( version 11.0.0 ) . calibrated event files for the mos1 , mos2 , and pn detectors",

    "events spread at most in two contiguous pixels for the pn ( i.e. , pattern = 04 ) and in four contiguous pixels for the mos ( i.e. , pattern = 012 ) have been selected .",
    "we further cleaned the data by accepting only the good time intervals ( gtis ) when the sky background was low for the whole camera ( @xmath9  counts  s@xmath10 for mos1 and mos2 , @xmath11  counts  s@xmath10 for pn ) . the effective exposure times after background cleaning for mos1 , mos2 , and pn are 11.0  ks , 12.3  ks , and 11.2  ks , respectively .",
    "data analyses were restricted to the 0.510.0  kev energy band .",
    "we have also observed g38.71.4  with chandra on 2012 june 9 - 10 ( obsid 13770 ) using advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - i ) with a frame time of 3.2  s. the total exposure time is @xmath12  ks . the data was configured in the vfaint telemetry mode .",
    "data reduction and analysis were processed with chandra interactive analysis observations ( ciao ) version 4.5 software and the chandra calibration database ( caldb ) version 4.5.5.1 .",

    "these two images were created by using an adaptive smoothing algorithm with a gaussian radius of @xmath14 in order to probe the detailed structure of the diffuse emission . a center - filled x - ray morphology has been revealed .",
    "the angular extent of g38.71.4  as seen in x - ray is @xmath15 ( major axis and minor axis of the dashed ellipse illustrated in fig .",

    "these continuum observations were collected at a central frequency of 1.4  ghz in the vla s d configuration .",
    "after standard cleaning process , a calibrated radio image of g38.71.4   is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] left panel .",
    "this incomplete radio shell along the southern part of g38.71.4  is consistent with that taken with the effelsberg radio telescope at 11  cm ( schaudel et al .",
    "2002 ) . in this vla radio map ,",
    "apart from the diffuse emission , we noted an extended bright radio feature around the center of the fov . for comparing the radio and x - ray features of g38.71.4 , we overlaid the radio contours on the xmm - newton mos1/2 image ( see figure  [ fig3 ] right panel ) .    for searching the counterpart of g38.71.4  in the other wavelengths ,",

    "+ to investigate if these x - ray sources are promising isolated neutron star candidates , we focused on those coinciding with the remnant emission ( source ids : 13 , 17 , 19 , 20 ) and proceeded to search for their possible optical counterparts since the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio ( @xmath18 ) provides a rudimentary parameter for discriminating the nature of the source . for an isolated neutron star ,",
