    "it has long been known that there are more x - ray binaries per unit stellar mass in globular clusters than in field stellar populations ( clark 1975 ) .",
    "the process by which x - ray binaries form in globular clusters is different from x - ray binary formation processes in low density field star populations . in globular clusters , close",
    "binaries are formed through interactions between stars , be they tidal captures ( fabian et al .",
    "1975 ) , exchange encounters ( hills 1976 ) , or direct collisions ( verbunt & hut 1987 ) . as a result",
    ", the orbital period distributions of the systems may be quite different from one another .",
    "whether black holes exist in globular clusters is a topic of great importance for understanding the dynamical evolution of clusters ( e.g. sippel & hurley 2013 ; heggie & giersz 2014 ; morscher et al .",
    "2015 ) , and the formation of gravitational wave sources .",
    "black holes in globular clusters are likely to have a different mass distribution than those in field x - ray binaries , extending up to higher masses , because the black holes in field x - ray binaries form predominantly through common envelope evolution ( e.g. van den heuvel 1983 ) , while the black holes in cluster x - ray binaries may have formed in from single stars , or wide binary progenitors , and then entered binaries through tidal capture ( fabian et al .",
    "1975 ) or exchange interactions ( hills 1976 ) .. one can compare , for example , the expected distribution of black hole masses from single star evolution ( fryer & kalogera 2001 ) with the observed distribution from x - ray binaries ( zel et al . 2010 ; farr et al .",
    "the observed black holes are lighter than the distribution predicted in the case of single star evolution , lending credence to the idea that common envelopes lead to lower black hole masses .",
    "there have also been suggestions that heavier black holes may also form at low metallicity ( e.g. linden et al .",
    "2010 ; mapelli et al .",
    "2010 ) , and many globular clusters are significantly more metal poor than the typical star in the galactic field . the overall level of x - ray emission , and the luminosities of the brightest individual x - ray sources are highest in the most metal poor star forming galaxies ( basu - zych et al .",
    "2013 ; brorby et al . 2014 ) indicating that the metallicity must affect either the masses of the compact objects , or the number of close binaries with compact objects .",
    "these claims had also appeared to be supported by the reports of @xmath0 black holes in two low metallicty galaxies , in the binaries ic  10  x-1 and ngc  300  x-1 ( prestwich et al .",
    "2007 ; crowther et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the mass estimates for both of these objects have recently been called into question because the phasing of the x - ray eclipses relative to the radial velocity curves indicate that the radial velocity curves are not tracing the orbits of the donor stars ( laycock et al . 2015a , b ; binder et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "there are a few more reasons why identifying stellar mass black hole x - ray binaries in globular clusters is of major astrophysical importance .",
    "these objects are unlikely to survive in the same globular clusters that contain intermediate mass black holes ( leigh et al .",
    "2014 ) ; instead , dynamical friction should cause them to sink to the center of the cluster , where the imbh will split the binaries .",
    "additionally , stellar mass black holes in globular clusters represent an extreme case that can be used to test theories of space - times with more than 4 dimensions in which hawking radiation might be far more efficient than in a spacetime described by standard general relativity ( emparan et al . 2002 ; psaltis 2007 ) ; globular clusters give excellent `` clocks '' for proving that the black hole in question is quite old , so stellar mass black holes in globular clusters give the strongest available constraints on this problem ( gnedin et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the black hole x - ray binaries that form via tidal capture should be persistent x - ray sources , while those that form via exchange interactions might be predominantly transient sources ( kalogera et al . 2004 ) .",
    "we define the boundary between persistent and transient sources here to be sources which are unaffected and affected , respectively , by the ionization instability in their accretion disks ",
    "i.e. persistent sources accrete rapidly enough that their outer accretion disks are ionized at all times , while transient sources are sources which have low enough accretion rates that they spend most of their times in states where the outer disk is neutral , and hence they are subject to this instability ( e.g. cannizzo , wheeler & ghosh 1985 ; cannizzo , chen & livio 1995 ; king et al .",
    "1996 ) . in practice , this should be associated with variations of a factor of @xmath1 or more in luminosity , but given the long outbursts of sources with long orbital periods ( see e.g. truss & done 2006 ) , there may be objects which appear to be persistent over the lifetime of x - ray astronomy , but which are undergoing such outburst cycles . the basis for the suggestion that tidal capture sources would be persistent comes from king et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , where it was shown that black hole x - ray binaries with orbital periods of a few to ten hours would typically have mass transfer rates that would make them persistent sources .",
    "barnard et al .",
    "( 2008 ) use this as part of the argument for why it is reasonable to find many persistent objects at luminosities of @xmath2 erg / sec in m31 globular clusters , and to associate them with black hole accretors . on the other hand persistent black holes",
    "are not seen in substantial numbers in the galactic field populations . the known black hole x - ray binaries in this period range are predominantly transient sources  only one strong candidate black hole x - ray binary with a low mass donor star is persistent ",
    "4u  1957 + 11 ( gomez et al . 2015 )  and even that object is not a dynamically confirmed black hole .    for quite some time , it was thought that globular clusters would not contain stellar mass black holes in substantial numbers .",
    "spitzer ( 1969 ) had shown that dynamical decoupling would result based on a criterion involving a critical combination of the fraction of the cluster s mass , and the ratio of the masses of the heavy objects to the masses of the light objects .",
    "this criterion would be satisfied for black holes in most old star clusters .",
    "this then leads to a combination of effects that should eject a large numbers of the black holes  dynamical evaporation and ejection in three body encounters being the two most important ( kulkarni et al . 1993 ; sigurdsson & hernquist 1993 ) .",
    "additionally , the gravitational radiation rocket effect ( redmount & rees 1975 ) could also eject a large fraction of any black holes that merge .",
    "additional discussion , both in the 1970 s and in the past 15 years , has concerned the possibility of finding intermediate mass black holes in globular clusters . in recent years , searches have been partially motivated by placing globular clusters on the @xmath3 relation for galaxies ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000;ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) and finding that , if the nature of the systems is the same , they should host intermediate mass black holes ; and partly by numerical calculations that suggest that either mergers of stellar mass black holes ( miller & hamilton 2002 ) or mergers of massive stars ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ) could lead to the production of intermediate mass black holes in globular clusters . concrete observational evidence has continued to be lacking .",
    "dynamical studies have , in some cases , shown evidence for increasing mass - to - light ratios in the centers of globular clusters ( e.g. newell et al .",
    "1975 ; gerssen et al .",
    "2002 ; noyola et al .",
    "dynamics theory has argued that mass segregation should place an excess of stellar remnants in the centers of globular clusters ( illingworth & king 1976 ; baumgardt et al .",
    "proper motion studies of omega cen to date have not shown a need for an intermediate mass black hole ( van der marel & anderson 2010 ; watkins et al .",
    "searches for accretion signatures , both in x - rays ( grindlay et al .",
    "2001 ; haggard et al . 2013 ) and in radio ( e.g. maccarone 2004 ; strader et al .",
    "2012a ) have yielded only upper limits , which in some cases are below the estimates from dynamical studies .    on the other hand , over the past decade , the evidence for globular clusters with stellar mass black holes has mounted .",
    "the first evidence was seen from extremely bright , strongly variable sources in galaxies within 20 mpc ( maccarone et al .",
    "2007 ; brassington et al .",
    "2008 ) , followed by observations of `` ultrasoft '' spectra ( white & marshall 1984 ) from moderately variable sources in ngc  4472 ( maccarone et al . 2011 ) .",
    "more recently , flat spectrum radio sources have been detected in the cores of many milky way clusters at luminosities in excess of what is expected from neutron star x - ray binaries ( strader et al .",

    "2013 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use joint swift - nustar spectra of several bright x - ray sources in m31 globular clusters to help determine whether they are accreting black holes or accreting neutron stars .",
    "the sources are selected on the basis of being bright globular cluster x - ray sources which are in our nustar fields and are sufficiently isolated as to allow straightforward spectroscopy .",
    "two of these have already been claimed to be globular cluster black holes ( barnard et al .",
    "2011 ) on the basis of fits to spectra taken by chandra and xmm - newton .",
    "in this paper , we find that the spectra of both of those sources , as well as those of two other bright globular cluster x - ray sources in m31 , are much better fit by models typically used to fit the spectra of neutron stars than models typically used to fit the spectra of black holes .",
    "we also discuss in this paper possible reasons why the prediction made in kalogera et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that tidal capture products should be persistent sources is at odds with observations of other galactic black hole x - ray binaries in a similar orbital period range .",
    "accreting compact objects typically show a few key spectral states in which substantial amounts of time are spent .",
    "historically the nomenclature for these sources has been different for black holes and neutron stars , but in recent years , terminology has begun to converge for the lower luminosity , more stable source states .",
    "the first indications of spectral state dichotomy were discovered by tananbaum et al .",
    "( 1972 ) , who found , in cygnus x-1 , that the radio emission turned off as the x - ray spectrum went from being dominated by hard x - rays to being dominated by soft x - rays .",
    "hard states are well modelled by thermal comptonization in an optically thin , geometrically thick hot flow ( thorne & price 1975 ) .",
    "these states are always seen at low luminosities ( in the `` low / hard states '' , typically seen below 2% of the eddington limit ",
    "maccarone 2003 ) , and are often seen at higher luminosities at the starts of transient outbursts , due to a hysteresis effect seen in black holes ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1995 ) and found to show analogous behavior in neutron stars ( maccarone & coppi 2003 ) and even in accreting white dwarfs ( wheatley et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the accreting neutron stars , it was once common to refer to such states as island states , following hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) , but in recent years , the term `` hard state '' has been applied to both black hole and neutron star accretion flows .",
    "x - ray binaries also often exhibit states well explained by standard accretion disk models ( e.g. shakura & sunayev 1973 ; davis et al .",
    "2005 ) , in which the emission is thermal with gravitational energy release balanced by radiation .",
    "these states are dominated by soft x - rays , and are often called soft states .",
    "neutron stars with similar accretion rates will typically show more complicated spectra , presumably because there is emission from both the accretion disk and the boundary layer ( i.e. the region near the surface of the star where the excess rotational energy of the inflow is dissipated ) ",
    "see e.g. white & marshall ( 1984 ) . with high signal - to - noise ratio , it is often necessary to use two components to model `` soft state '' neutron star spectra .",
    "the spectra of neutron stars in such states tend to peak at higher temperatures than the spectra of black holes , but they still show strong curvature above 10 kev , rather than power law spectra , and the difference in temperature is likely to be due primarily to the @xmath4 temperature dependence for accretion disks at a constant eddington fraction which extend in to the innermost stable circular orbit",
    ".    bright neutron stars often behave as `` z - sources '' , so named because as they vary , they evolve through a colour - colour diagram along a path that is shaped roughly like the letter `` z '' ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) . the spectral shapes for these sources are not much different from those of the soft state sources",
    ". they can generally be well - modelled by low temperature , moderate optical depth thermal comptonization models when the count rates are low , and often require two quasi - thermal components when observed at high signal - to - noise ratio . the brightest atoll sources ",
    "i.e. the brightest `` soft state '' neutron stars  have spectra that are quite difficult to distinguish from the z - source spectra ( e.g. di salvo et al .",
    "2002 ; gierliski & done 2002 ) , and there is even one source , xte  j1701 - 462 , which transitions between the atoll and z behaviours , but which does not show any dramatic difference between z - source aand bright atoll source spectra ( lin , remillard & homan 2009 ) .",
    "the z - sources are generally a bit more strongly variable than the brightest atoll sources ( e.g. van der klis 1995 ) , but this distinction is not something of which we can take advantage when working with sources in m31 due to the relatively low count rates .    extremely bright black hole accretion disks , as well as black hole accretion disks observed during the transition between the hard state and the soft state , show different modes of behavior ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1991 ; homan et al .",
    "the brightest accretors probably have radiation pressure - dominated disks ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , and can be moderately well modelled as steep power laws and are sometimes called steep power law states ( mcclintock & remillard 2006 ) .",
    "these states are relatively uncommon and short - lived in most systems .",
    "they are seen fairly often in grs  1915 + 105 , but that object is typically near the eddington limit , and on the basis of its luminosity alone , it would be classified as a black hole without much debate , now that its distance is well established ( reid et al .",
    "we make use of data sets obtained from swift and nustar .",
    "both the nustar data and the swift data have been extracted with 45  apertures around the already - known source positions ( galetti et al .",
    "2004 ; peacock et al .",
    "2010 ) . the names , positions and magnitudes of the clusters are given in table [ clusters ] . there",
    "do exist higher signal - to - noise archival xmm and chandra data for these sources , but we prefer the quasi - simultaneous swift data over the chandra / xmm data , because the systematic uncertainties that may be induced due to source variability are hard to quantify and likely are more important than the increased statistical errors from the swift data .",
    "the data are grouped to a minimum of 1 count per bin to avoid some poorly understood statistical problems . in the plots ,",
    "further rebinning is done to help make the figures clearer , but these binnings are not used for spectral fitting .",
    "source - free background regions near the sources are used for creating background spectra for both instruments , and response matrices are generated with the standard tools for both satellites .",
    "for nustar , fmpa and fmpb data are combined , and an averaged response matrix is produced .",
    "we have three nustar observations which were used for this project .",

    "( 2011 ) to be a strong candidate for being a globular cluster black hole on the basis of appearing to fit well to a low / hard state spectrum while being at a luminosity ( varying in the range from 0.82.4@xmath5erg / sec in the 0.310.0 kev band ) above which neutron stars do not show low hard states . with nustar , the single power law model gives an unacceptable fit ",
    "clearly the data show more curvature than a single power law allows",
    ". disk blackbody model with free temperature and column density produces a fit which is marginally statistically acceptable , but which requires an unphysically small inner disk radius ( i.e. much less than a schwarzschild radius ) , unphysically large temperatures ( i.e. @xmath6 2 kev ) , and no galactic column density . when the model is forced to have an inner disc radius of 30  km , the fit is no longer statistically acceptable .",
    "the comptt model provides a fit which is statistically acceptable , and which has parameters in line with typical z sources and typical bright atoll sources .",
    "the flux from the comptt model , correcting for absorption , is @xmath7 erg / sec/@xmath8 , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath9 erg / sec for a distance of 784 kpc ( stanek & garnavich 1998 ) , which is also a typical value for a z source .",
    "figures are presented for the power law fit ",

    "these figures are representative of the results for all the sources , so we do not present figures for the fits to the other sources .",
    "the results for this source are quite similar to those for bo  153 .",
    "this source was also claimed by barnard et al .",
    "( 2011 ) to be a strong globular cluster black hole candidate on the ground of being a bright hard state object .",
    "like for bo  153 , we find that the power law model fits are not statistically acceptable , and that the statistically acceptable disk blackbody model fits have unphysically small inner disk radii and unphysically large temperatures .",
    "we find that the thermal comptonization model gives a fit that is typical of z - sources and bright atoll sources .",
    "the flux from the model , correcting for absorption , is @xmath10 erg / sec/@xmath11 , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath12 erg / sec , which is , again , typical for z - sources and bright atoll sources .",
    "an additional bright x - ray source in m31 is bo  225 .",
    "this object is less well studied than the two previously discussed sources and has not been claimed in the past to be a black hole candidate .",
    "the only model that fits this source well is the comptt model .",
    "this source , then , we may have run into the limitations of using such a simple thermal comptonization model , and the data may be justifying a slightly high level of complexity . nonetheless , this model is clearly the best of the group we have tried .",
    "the flux from the unabsorbed comptt model is @xmath13erg / sec/@xmath11 , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath14 erg / sec . the combination of the luminosity of the source , and the fact that comptt provides both a statistically acceptable fit and reasonable parameter values , indicates that the source can be confidently identified as a z - source or a bright atoll source .",
    "bo  375 has also been observed with nustar and swift .",
    "this is a bright source which has been previously classified as a neutron star ( barnard et al 2008 ) . for this source",
    ", none of the models with a single continuum component provides a good fit to the data .",
    "the data can be well fit with a model consisting of a disk blackbody plus a comptonized blackbody , which is one of the models often used to fit z - sources and bright atoll sources ( null hypothesis probability of 0.31 ) and marginally well - fit by a disk blackbody plus power law model ( null hypothesis probability of 0.03 ) .",
    "the inner disk radius for the disk blackbody plus power law model is unphysically small ( 12 km ) , so this model is additionally disfavored . the flux from the disk blackbody plus comptonized blackbody model , correcting for absorption , is @xmath15erg / sec/@xmath11 , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath16 erg / sec for a distance of 784 kpc .",
    "this value is slightly above the eddington luminosity for a 1.4@xmath17 neutron star .",
    "this value is slightly above the highest luminosity seen from sco  x-1 of @xmath18 erg / sec ( barnard et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is robust given the geometric parallax distance ( bradshaw et al .",
    "1999 ) , but the discrepancy can be explained if the neutron star in bo  375 is a bit more massive than the neutron star in sco  x-1 , or if the neutron star in bo  375 is accreting hydrogen - poor gas . given that ultracompact x - ray binaries represent a substantial fraction of the x - ray binaries in milky way globular clusters ( stella et al . 1987 ; dieball et al . 2005 ; zurek et al . 2009 ) , this latter interpretation would not be surprising .",
    "barnard et al .",
    "( 2008 ) had previously found with xmm - newton data that a single power law could not fit the spectrum of that source , suggesting that it is a neutron star .",

    "( 2008 ) .",
    "sk182c is located in the same field of view as bo  375 , and hence is included in the same observations .. this source is fainter than the others , so our ability to rule out models is somewhat diminished .",
    "for this source , we find both the power law and comptt models to be statistically acceptable and to have reasonable parameter values .",
    "the flux from the model , correcting for absorption , is @xmath19erg / sec/@xmath11 , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath20 erg / sec at the distance to m31 .",
    "for the spectra we analyze here , we find that either a low hard state black hole model or a neutron star model could fit well to the data .",
    "the disk blackbody models are all statistically unacceptable . given that the source is at about 5% of the eddington luminosity for an 8 @xmath17 black hole , and that black holes at such a luminosity are usually in soft states unless they are caught in the rise of a transient outburst ( maccarone 2003 ; kalemci et al .",
    "2013 ) , the black hole interpretation is disfavored for this source , but not as strongly as for the other sources in the sample .",
    "this source also has no previous identification as either a black hole or a neutron star .",
    "these results cast doubt on many of the other claims of globular cluster black holes in m31 globular clusters .",
    "many of these are based on the same methodology as the claims for bo  153 and bo  185 .",
    "the results also illustrate the importance of having a broad bandpass , as from nustar , for making classifications of black hole and neutron star spectra . in particular , the z - source / bright atoll source spectral models can be seen to be relatively similar to power law spectra",
    ", as long as most of the counts are obtained below about 10 kev where the spectra break sharply .",
    "this is , notably , where the responses of chandra and xmm - newton start to become poor .",
    "some additional support for the neutron star nature of the sources can come from looking at the milky way s population of persistent black hole candidates . the only dynamically confirmed black hole candidate which is persistent is cygnus x-1 ( gies & bolton 1986 ; caballero - nieves et al .",
    "2009 ; orosz et al .",
    "2011 ) , which spends most of its time in a hard state , but which is likely to be immune from the full ionization instability due to having a high mass donor star , and being wind - fed so that the circularization radius of the disc is smaller than for roche lobe overflow from a star with the same orbital period ( see discussion in smith et al .",
    "cygnus x-3 represents a similar case , although its dynamical confirmation is not clear ( szostek & zdziarski 2008 ) .",
    "ss  433 is even less securely a black hole , and is likely intrinsically super - eddington but observed edge - on so that only scattered x - rays are seen ( e.g. charles et al . 2004 ) .",
    "4u  1957 + 11 is not dynamically confirmed , but appears to spend most of its time in soft states ( gomez et al . 2015 ) .",
    "there are two other persistent sources , 1e  1740.7 - 2942 and grs  1758 - 258 , which appear to be long x - ray periodicities ( 12.73 and 18.45 days , respectively ) , and which spend significant fractions of their time in hard states , but these objects are not dynamically confirmed black holes , they have unknown donor types ( smith et al .",
    "2002b ) , and the periods are significantly longer than expected for tidal capture products .",
    "the persistent hard state black hole sources with low mass donors thus may not exist at all , and are clearly , at most , a small fraction of the total source population bright enough to be detected with all - sky instruments in the milky way ( which is a similar luminosity limit to the luminosity needed to detect a source at all in m31 ) .",
    "there are , of course , a number of relatively steady quiescent black hole sources , which might be regarded as persistent hard state sources , but all of these which are dynamically confirmed as black holes have undergone large outbursts .",
    "there are selection effects against dynamical confirmation of black holes in persistently bright x - ray binaries .",
    "nonetheless , there is only one candidate persistent black hole low mass x - ray binary whose orbital period is short enough to be in the @xmath21hrrange where tidal capture might work , 4u 1957 + 11 .",
    "there are many black hole x - ray binaries with both shorter and longer orbital periods which are transients , and there are no other persistent x - ray emitters whose x - ray emission properties mark them as likely black hole accretors . as a result , it seems highly unlikely that black hole x - ray binaries that form from tidal capture are typically persistent , but it can not be excluded that this might occasionally happen .",
    "one of the original motivations for considering these objects to be persistent black hole binaries formed by tidal capture was that such objects had been predicted to exist .",
    "repeated claims exist in the literature ( e.g. , kalogera et al .",
    "2004 ; barnard et al .",
    "2009 ) that tidal capture black hole x - ray binaries should be persistently x - ray bright .",
    "thus , our finding that these objects in m31 are likely neutron stars gives us good cause to re - consider some of the assumptions that went into these claims .",
    "in particular , it is worth considering why it may actually be unlikely for a large population of persistent black hole x - ray binaries to exist , especially in the orbital period range expected for tidal capture products .",
    "standard binary evolution and disk instability theory predicts that systems with orbital periods of about 10 hours , the range expected from tidal captures , should be persistent sources ( king et al . 1996 ; kalogera et al .",
    "however , as we describe below , this claim is not in line with phenomenology of outburst behaviour from black hole x - ray binaries , and we suggest that mass loss in disk winds can explain the discrepancy between observation and theory .",
    "comparison of figure 1 of king et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , which shows the expected mass transfer rates as a function of orbital period , and figure 7 of lasota ( 2001 ) , which shows observed mean accretion rates as a function of orbital period indicates a clear discrepancy between the two values .",
    "king et al . ( 1996 ) find that the typical mass transfer rates in black hole x - ray binaries in that orbital period range should be @xmath22/yr , while the recurrence times of x - ray transients indicate that the mass transfer rates are more typically a few times @xmath23/yr . indeed ,",
    "the discrepancy is already implicitly noted by king et al .",
    "( 1996 ) themselves , who point out that the known low mass x - ray binaries with black hole primaries are predominantly soft x - ray transients , rather than persistent emitters .",
    "our finding that these persistent sources in m31 are more likely neutron stars than black holes underscores this point .",
    "a few possible explanations exist for the paucity of persistent black hole emitters .",
    "perhaps the simplest is to invoke a mechanism that lowers the accretion rate onto the cental black hole relative to that predicted from the prescriptions for binary evolution used in king et al .",
    "two possible ways to change the mass accretion rates are to change the mass transfer rates by invoking alternative prescriptions for magnetic braking , and invoking non - conservative mass transfer due to disk winds .",
    "the now - good agreement between theory and data for models of evolution of cataclysmic variables ( knigge et al . 2011 ) casts doubt on the possibility that magnetic braking prescriptions are badly flawed , unless the donor stars in black hole x - ray binaries are considerably more bloated than those in cataclysmic variables .",
    "disk winds , on the other hand , show clear evidence of being present and important in x - ray binaries .",
    "if we take , for example , the best studied quiescent x - ray binary , a0620 - 00 we see that it has an orbital period of 7.1 hours , and a donor mass of 0.4 @xmath17 , meaning that its donor mass is about 0.6 times as large as that of an unevolved star filling its roche lobe , given the well known relationship between donor star mass and orbital period for main sequence stars .",
    "this produces a reduction in mass transfer rate by a factor of about 3.5  a substantial factor , but not one large enough to explain the discrepancy between the observed mean outburst fluence averaged over the best estimate of the source duty cycle and the predicted mass transfer rates .",
    "therefore , it appears more likely that disk winds during the outbursts of black hole x - ray binaries lead to highly non - conservative mass transfer and hence make the mean accretion rate by the compact object less than the mass loss rate by the donor star .",
    "three methods have been used to estimate the mass loss due to disk winds , and all result in the finding that @xmath24 of the mass lost by the donor star is also lost by the accretion disk .",
    "one method for making the estimate is the result above , that transient outbursts seem to have recurrence timescales about 10 times too long , and that some objects which would be expected to be persistent are , in fact , transient .",
    "another is that estimates can be made of the depths of absorption lines seen from the accretion disks , the opening angles of the disk winds , and the chemical composition and ionization state of the absorbing gas , and convert these to mass loss rates in the disk wind ( e.g. neilsen et al .",
    "additionally , one can estimate the mass transfer rate from the luminosity of the hot spot where the accretion stream impacts the outer accretion disk , and compare with the quiescent x - ray luminosity and with the outburst duty cycle ( e.g. froning et al . 2011 ) .",
    "finally , two short - period x - ray binaries have period derivatives that can not be well explained in the light of standard binary evolution scenarioes ( gonzalez hernandez et al . 2014 ) .",
    "if mass loss is the cause of the latter effect , then strong mass loss takes place even for quiescent x - ray binaries .",
    "this is at odds with prominent interpretations of recent findings that strong x - ray absorption lines are seen only when sources are in x - ray soft states ( neilsen & lee 2009 ; ponti et al .",
    "2012 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the ionization state of the wind , rather than the presence of the wind , is what changes at state transitions , then the claims can be reconciled .",
    "additionally , there are detections of single - peaked emission lines in gx  339 - 4 in hard states ( wu et al . 2001 ) , and single - peaked lines from accretors are often associated with scatter broadening of lines by disk winds ( e.g. shlosman & vitello 1993 ; knigge & drew 1996 murray & chiang 1996 ; sim et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "all these methods of estimating the actual accretion rates in black hole x - ray binaries , and the amount of mass loss in their winds , suggest that mass transfer is in black hole binaries is highly non - conservative .",
    "systems which would be persistent can then be forced into quiescent regimes because the mass loss will reduce the central accretion rates and reduce the irradiation of the outer disks by the inner disks ; additionally , just the mere loss of mass will reduce the gas density , and hence the gas temperature in the outer disks , even in the absence of irradiation .",
    "the duty cycles of bright sources are then suppressed compared to what would be expected .",
    "importantly , in cataclysmic variables , the mass loss rates in the wind are very small compared to mass accretion rates by the central white dwarfs ( vitello & shlosman 1988 ; knigge et al .",
    "1995 ) , so disk winds should not be important for cv evolution .",
    "the same may be true for neutron star accretors .",
    "thus , in hindsight , one should not expect a substantial population of persistent black hole x - ray binaries , even if the systems are formed by tidal capture , and persistent sources should be expected to more commonly be neutron stars , as we have found here .    at the same time , a more detailed treatment of disk winds would be well - justified . in this paper",
    ", we have discussed disk winds only in the context of removing mass from the accretion disk at a constant accretion rate . a more detailed treatment of nonconservative mass transfer",
    "would also consider the angular momentum carried away by the mass lost from the accretion disk and its subsequent effects on the mass transfer rate itself .",
    "such a treatment lies beyond the scope of this paper , but would be well - justified in light of recent developments .",
    "we have examined 5 globular cluster sources at @xmath25 erg / sec in m31 with a combination of data from swift and nustar . we have found that in all cases , the data can be well fitted with high optical depth ( @xmath26@xmath27@xmath28 ) , low temperature ( @xmath29@xmath30 ) kev comptonization models , while for four of the five sources , the data argue strongly against a single power law model fitting the data , and for all the sources , the data argue against a multi - temperature blackbody disk model fitting the data . as a result , we argue that these sources are all likely to be high accretion rate neutron star x - ray binaries , although the data are not presently good enough to determine whether they are `` z - sources '' or bright atoll sources in soft states .",
    "bolstering the idea that these are neutron stars is the dearth of black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "because past theoretical work has argued that the accretion rates expected within a particular range of orbital periods should yield persistent black hole x - ray binaries , we have discussed how non - conservative mass transfer due to disc winds leads to a violation of the assumptions of the past work .",
    "tjm thanks christian knigge for an illuminating talk at `` the physics of cataclysmic and compact binaries '' , and helena uthas , joe patterson , christian knigge and jeno sokoloski for having organized the meeting . he also thanks joey neilsen , chris done , and maria diaz trigo for useful discussions about disk winds .",
