    "the concept of heat engines is a classical subject in thermodynamics . to achieve the highest efficiency",
    ", a heat engine needs to operate a reversible thermodynamic cycle which requires at least a quasi - static process  @xcite and results in a vanishing power .",
    "the thermodynamic cycle should be speeded up to produce a finite power . in our times of energy shortage , it is valuable to investigate how large the efficiency of a heat engine can be reached when the engine operates in the region of maximum power .",
    "this issue has lead to the birth of finite - time thermodynamics which has attracted much attention  @xcite for many years .",
    "the most notable result in finite - time thermodynamics is the curzon - ahlborn efficiency , @xmath3 , which is the efficiency at maximum power for a macroscopically endoreversible heat engine  @xcite operating between a cold bath at temperature @xmath1 and a hot bath at temperature @xmath2 .",
    "recently , researchers started discussing the availability of the curzon - ahlborn efficiency for the microscopic models  @xcite of heat engines .",
    "schmiedl and seifert  @xcite constructed a stochastic heat engine by using a time - dependent harmonic potential to control a brownian particle . within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics",
    "@xcite , they fully investigated the energetics of this engine without the consideration of inertial effects .",
    "they found that the efficiency at maximum power of this stochastic heat engine is smaller than the curzon - ahlborn efficiency .",
    "the present author  @xcite investigated the energetics of the feynman ratchet as a heat engine and found that the efficiency at maximum power of the feynman ratchet is larger than the curzon - ahlborn efficiency .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found that the efficiency at maximum power of a quantum - dot heat engine is even larger than that of feynman ratchet . on the one hand , three kinds of microscopic models mentioned above hint a universality of efficiency at maximum power up to the quadratic order for heat engines operating between two heat baths at small temperature difference .",
    "this universality has been confirmed by a model of particle transport  @xcite , a quantum - dot engine  @xcite , and a generic model  @xcite of heat engines . on the other hand , these researches imply that it is quite difficult to construct a microscopic model of heat engines which can exactly achieve the curzon - ahlborn efficiency , @xmath3 .    although great progress has been made in finite - time thermodynamics , one of key challenges is still the realizability of finite - time adiabatic processes .",
    "generally speaking , the adiabaticity requires a slowly enough process since the irreversibility usually accompanies a finite - time process .",
    "if finite - time adiabatic processes are proved to be impossible , the validation of the curzon - ahlborn efficiency and many main results in finite - time thermodynamics is questionable .",
    "therefore , it is extremely urgent for us to solve this challenge .",
    "the concept of shortcuts to adiabaticity  @xcite developed in recent years throws light on this challenge . by utilizing shortcuts to adiabaticity in a quantum thermodynamical cycle , del campo _ et al .",

    "the capital letters a , b , c , and d represent four processes (  isothermal \" expansion , ",
    "adiabatic \" compression ,  isothermal \" compression , and  adiabatic \" expansion ) in the thermodynamic cycle , respectively .",
    "the times @xmath106 , @xmath104 , @xmath128 , and @xmath126 are not plotted in the same scale.,width=264 ]",
    "in this work , we construct a stochastic heat engine by using a time - dependent harmonic potential to control a brownian particle . by considering the inertial effect of the particle and shortcuts to adiabaticity , we find that the efficiency at maximum power for this microscopically stochastic heat engine is exactly equal to the curzon - ahlborn efficiency for endoreversible heat engines .",
    "our microscopic model has several advantages relative to the curzon - ahlborn model .",
    "the effective temperatures are well - defined in two  isothermal \" processes .",
    "it is unnecessary for us to assume the effective temperatures to be constant as done in the curzon - ahlborn model .",
    "in particular , eqs .",
    "( [ eq - betaivsa ] ) and ( [ eq - betaivsc ] ) reveal that the effective temperatures are actually inconstant , which is consistent with the fact recently pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the assumption of constant effective temperatures is not the necessary condition for achieving the curzon - ahlborn efficiency .",
    "in addition , the finite - time adiabatic processes in our model can be realized with the aid of shortcuts to adiabaticity .",
    "it is still unknown how to realize finite - time adiabatic processes for a macroscopic heat engine such as the curzon - ahlborn model .",
    "the present stochastic heat engine follows the exquisite model proposed by schmiedl and seifert  @xcite .",
    "but our start point is different from theirs . in ref .",
    "@xcite , schmiedl and seifert are focused on the overdamping case where the inertial effect of the brownian particle is neglected while we are concerned with the underdamping case where the inertial effect plays a large role .",
    "however , it is this small distinction in the start point that leads to qualitatively different consequences .",
    "first , the process in which the protocol @xmath72 increases ( decreases ) with time corresponds to a compression ( an expansion ) of position distribution in schmiedl - seifert model , while the process in which the protocol @xmath72 increases ( decreases ) with time corresponds to an expansion ( a compression ) of momentum distribution in our model .",
    "in other words , the protocol generating the thermodynamic cycle of a heat engine in sec .",
    "[ sec - model ] leads to a refrigerator rather than a heat engine within the framework of schmiedl - seifert model .",
    "second , the finite - time adiabatic processes in our model can be realized with the aid of shortcuts to adiabaticity . suddenly switching the brownian particle from a hot bath to a cold bath",
    "will not produce entropy in the schmiedl - seifert model since the position distribution is instantaneously unchanged .",
    "however , the mismatch of kinetic energy in this transition will inevitably result in heat exchange between two heat baths .",
    "this point is similar to the criticism  @xcite to feynman s analysis of the ratchet as a heat engine .",
    "that is , the adiabatic transition in the schmiedl - seifert model is not genuinely adiabatic . in succeeding work by seifert s group  @xcite , schmiedl _ et al .",
    "_ also found that it is important to consider the inertial effect ( i.e. , the kinetic energy ) in the adiabatic transition .",
    "they obtained a counter - intuitive result that the minimal work in the adiabatic transition averaged on an initially thermalized ensemble for harmonic potentials is given by the adiabatic work even in the limit of short transition times .",
    "it is necessary for us to investigate the relationship between this result and the shortcut to adiabaticity in the future research .",
    "the present model may be generalized in two aspects .",
    "first , the reverse thermodynamic cycle will lead to a stochastic refrigerator .",
    "the optimization of refrigerators has been investigated by many researchers  @xcite . a reasonable target function",
    "is called @xmath179-criterion which is defined as the product of the coefficient of performance of refrigerators and the rate of heat absorbed from the cold bath  @xcite .",
    "the coefficient of performance at maximum @xmath179-criterion for endoreversible refrigerators is found to be @xmath180  @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to derive the coefficient of performance at maximum @xmath179-criterion for the stochastic refrigerator .",
    "second , the quantum version of the present stochastic heat engine is an intriguing topic . to do that",
    ", we need to overcome several difficulties such as the subtle definition of quantum carnot - like thermodynamic cycle , and the proper definitions of work and heat  @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss the realizability of the present stochastic heat engine in experiments .",
    "recently , blickle and bechinger  @xcite have demonstrated the experimental realization of a microscopically stirling heat engine by using a time - dependent optical laser trap to control a single colloidal particle of diameter 2.94  @xmath181 m . through qualitative analysis",
    ", one can see that the inertial effect for a particle of diameter in micrometers is too small to be detected when we observed in the time - scale of seconds .",
    "therefore , the microscopic heat engine investigated by blickle and bechinger is similar to the stochastic heat engine proposed by schmiedl and seifert rather than the present model . to enhance the relative strength of inertial effects , one should increase the temporal resolution to microseconds .",
    "this difficulty has been overcome by experimental scientists  @xcite who achieved a temporal resolution of @xmath182  ns for a 1  @xmath181 m silica particle .",
    "in addition , the generation of shortcuts to adiabaticity mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec - shtadiab ] requires a nonlocal control to the system which might be difficult in experiments . recently",
    ", a local scheme  @xcite has been proposed , which can help us overcome the second difficulty . in a word",
    ", it is highly promising to realize the present stochastic heat engine in the laboratory .",
    "the author is grateful for financial supports from the national natural science foundation of china ( grant no .",
    ". he also thanks adolfo del campo for his kind discussions on shortcuts to adiabaticity .",
    "the rate of heat absorbed may be defined as @xmath183 where @xmath184 indicates that the heat is not a state variable and the heat absorbed from the heat bath depends on the detailed process .",
    "the ensemble average @xmath185 proceeds in two steps  @xcite .",
    "first , we average over all trajectories which are at time @xmath8 at given @xmath6 and @xmath9 leading to @xmath186 where @xmath187 and @xmath188 are the @xmath6 and @xmath9 components of @xmath189 in eq.([eq - kramersflux ] ) , respectively .",
    "second , averaging over all @xmath6 and @xmath9 with distribution function @xmath26 leads to @xmath190\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int dx\\int dp\\left [   \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}j_{x}+\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial p}j_{p}\\right ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & \\int dx\\int dp\\left(\\nabla h\\right )   \\cdot\\mathbf{j}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above equation may also be derived from the continuity equation of density @xmath191 and the continuity equation of energy @xmath192    using the above two equations , we have @xmath193-\\left [ \\frac{\\partial (   h\\rho )   } { \\partial t}-h\\frac{\\partial\\rho } { \\partial t}\\right ] \\right\\}\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int dx\\int dp\\left\\{\\left [   \\frac{\\mathrm{d } (   h\\rho )   } { \\mathrm{d } t}-\\frac{\\partial (   h\\rho )   } { \\partial t}\\right]-h\\left (   \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\rho}{\\mathrm{d}t}-\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t}\\right)\\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int dx\\int dp[\\nabla\\cdot(h\\mathbf{j})-h\\nabla \\cdot\\mathbf{j}]\\nonumber \\\\&=&\\int dx\\int dp (   \\nabla h )   \\cdot\\mathbf{j}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this equation , we arrive in the first line of eq .",
    "( [ eq - detaeq ] ) . with the consideration of the hamiltonian ( [ eq - hamtion0 ] )",

    "( [ eq - hameq ] ) into the above equation , we have @xmath201 that is , eq .",
