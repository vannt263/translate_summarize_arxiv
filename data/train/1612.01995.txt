    "[ fig : detector_setup ]    liquid scintillators such as ej-301 ( which is similar to ne-213 and bc-501 ) are very popular for neutron detection as they can easily be shaped into the desired size and geometry of a given application and offer fast timing performance .",
    "however , since such liquid scintillators are also sensitive to gamma rays , pulse - shape discrimination ( psd ) techniques are essential in order to correctly identify neutron interactions in the detector .    the ability to discriminate nuclear recoil ( nr ) events from electronic recoil ( er ) events originates in the particular production mechanisms of scintillation light in organic liquid scintillators .",
    "these liquids are aromatic compounds which have planar molecular structures built up from benzenoid rings .",
    "such structures allow for extended groupings of conjugated molecular bonds between unsaturated carbon atoms  @xcite .",
    "this results in some of the valence electrons of the carbon atoms being delocalized in @xmath0-molecular orbitals .",
    "it is the excitations of these @xmath0-electronic states that create the fluorescence observed in organic scintillators . during these excitations",
    ", @xmath0-electrons can be promoted from the ground state  s@xmath1 to excited singlet states  s@xmath2 or triplet  t@xmath2 states . for low excitation densities , all excited singlet states above the first excited singlet states s@xmath3 decay rapidly and non - radiatively to the lowest excited singlet state .",
    "this state then decays exponentially producing fluorescence in the process .",
    "in contrast , the decay of the triplet state is governed by the diffusion time - scale of the triplet exciton and results in delayed fluorescence in which the intensity does not decay exponentially .",
    "nrs exhibit greater energy - loss rates and thus have higher densities of triplet states . pulses from the ionization tracks of these particles exhibit higher yields of delayed fluorescence , hence decaying more slowly than those of ers .",
    "scintillation light from ej-301 has three main decay components : @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the slowest of these decay times is produced by the delayed fluorescence of triplet states .",
    "the different pulse shapes that arise from electronic and nuclear recoils in liquid scintillators can be exploited using different psd techniques .",
    "the most popular techniques applied are the charge comparison method  @xcite and the zero crossing method  @xcite .",
    "these methods were originally implemented in purpose - designed analogue electronics  @xcite , but with the advent of greater computing power at reduced costs , these techniques have been implemented digitally  @xcite",
    ". digital capture of the full waveform allows for offline processing of events , reducing dead time in data acquisition systems .",
    "techniques designed for analogue circuits do not take advantage of the increased information available in the digital domain .",
    "consequently , new psd techniques have been developed recently  @xcite .",
    "these techniques offer new pulse shape discrimination approaches in the time domain of the waveform , allow frequency - domain and decay - time differences to be investigated using wavelet analysis , and can implement fourier and laplace transforms .",
    "traditionally , the performance of psd techniques is characterized using the figure of merit ( fom ) , defined as : @xmath7 where peak separation refers to the distance between the center of the neutron and gamma distributions in a histogram of the discrimination parameter , and @xmath8 is the full - width half maximum of the respective distributions .",
    "hence , the fom does not provide any information on the energy dependence of the performance of psd techniques .",
    "this precludes a comparison of the various algorithms across different authors that may use different energy thresholds in the calculation of their fom , and additionally , may mask performance issues of the algorithms in particular at low recoil energy . therefore , we examine the energy - dependent ability of psd techniques to discriminate between electronic recoil and nuclear recoil events . furthermore",
    ", we determine the efficiency of ej-301 for detection of neutrons as a function of energy .",
    "the fast neutron detector used in this work is a 3 \"  cell of ej-301 liquid organic scintillator optically coupled to a fast photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) , type 9821 kb manufactured by et enterprises .",
    "the detector response to neutrons was characterized at the physikalisch - technische bundesanstalt ( ptb ) in braunschweig , germany , using a deuterium ion beam hitting a ti(@xmath9h ) target .",
    "the deuterium ion beam energy ( 3.356 mev ) was chosen to produce @xmath10 ( k=1 according to  @xcite ) monoenergetic neutrons via @xmath11h(d , n)@xmath12he nuclear reaction , in the direction of the ion beam .",
    "the detector was placed @xmath13 from the target .",
    "the output of the pmt was connected to a caen dt5751 digitizer , which samples at 1  ghz with a resolution of 10  bits .",
    "data were collected at three different nominal beam current settings to study the effect of neutron flux on the performance of the detector .",
    "the detector was placed such that the angle between the direction of the ion beam and the normal of the front face of the detector was 0@xmath14 .",
    "the distance between the front face of the detector and the active layer of the target was @xmath15 ( k=2  @xcite ) for all measurements .",
    "additional data were taken at each setting with a shadow cone placed between the target and the detector to measure the in - scatter of neutrons , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : detector_setup ] . at the highest nominal beam current ,",
    "data was also collected with an angle of 90@xmath14 between the direction of the ion beam and the front face of the detector . in the 90@xmath14 orientation the detector",
    "is rotated such that the neutron flux is incident on the side of the detector , rather than the front face .",
    "these datasets are listed in table  [ table : data_sets ] with their known fluxes as measured using calibrated detectors at ptb .",
    "dataset 4 has a greater flux than dataset 1 , despite the beam conditions being the same , due to the greater cross - sectional area the detector presents to the neutron beam in this orientation .",

    "we have compared the performance of five different pulse shape discrimination algorithms using a commercial liquid scintillator cell .",
    "the studied algorithms include the avant - garde algorithms standard event fit sef , fourier - series expansion fse , and laplace transform lap in addition to the traditional charge comparison method ccm and pulse - gradient analysis pga .",
    "the energy - dependent behaviour of all five algorithms was discussed as a better means of describing psd algorithms than the figure of merit previously used in the literature .    specifically , we considered the ability of each algorithm to accept nrs as function of recoil energy , as well as the purity of the resulting nr sample .",
    "we find that at 99@xmath17 rejection of er background events and above @xmath18 , the pga algorithm accepts the fewest number of nrs and is the least likely to identify a nr event from a reference sample .",
    "the ccm algorithm performs better than the pga method , but a marked deterioration in the performance of the ccm algorithm is observed as the rejection level of er events becomes more stringent .    both the sef algorithm and the lap algorithm display improved performance compared to the traditional methods considered .",
    "the sef algorithm is more likely to accept nrs from a reference sample at low energies , and it provides a higher acceptance of nr events below @xmath18 .",
    "the lap method however provides a slightly higher efficiency overall for the detection of nrs in ej-301 due to a better - resolved er band at higher energies .",
