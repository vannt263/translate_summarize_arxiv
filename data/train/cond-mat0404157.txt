    "the longstanding problem of understanding the dynamics of a charge carrier in an antiferromagnetic ( af ) background @xcite is at the center of the high - t@xmath7 puzzle .",
    "for example , one of the important controversies still not settled is deciding if a hole injected into an af mott insulator will keep its integrity @xcite or dissociate @xcite .",
    "these options imply two completely different ways of looking at the corresponding ground states : the first is a fermi - liquid and the second is not . in the first case ,",
    "does the spin - polaron concept @xcite capture all the basic ingredients of charge carrier dynamics in the cuprates ? in the second , does the resonating valence bond state @xcite , and the associated idea of spin - charge separation , can lead to an understanding of the phases at higher doping ?",
    "in addition , recent numerical results for the hubbard model @xcite , consistent with optical measurements @xcite , have raised the possibility of a _ partial _ spin - charge separation .",
    "the lack of an exact solution , either analytic or numeric , to strongly correlated models for the cuprates , like the @xmath0 or hubbard models , is at the origin of this and other controversies .",
    "it has been realized for some time already , that in addition to the technical difficulties associated with solving the most common model hamiltonians for the cuprates , the fact that all these models seem to have a variety of competing ground states with different order parameters makes it even more difficult to obtain a clear picture .",
    "this multiplicity of competing ground states is reflected in the richness of the cuprates phase diagram and has given high visibility to theories which explore quantum phase transition ( qpt ) ideas @xcite . in some cases , this competition seems to be resolved through the mutual coexistence of two different order parameters , as in the specific case of the stripes observed through neutron scattering measurements @xcite or the recurrent observation of af order in the superconducting ( sc ) phase @xcite through nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , and muon - spin - rotation ( @xmath8-sr ) .",
    "it is important to notice that parts of the various aspects revealed by experiments emerge in results obtained with different methods applied to slightly different hamiltonians ; however the overall picture never seems complete or coherent . until a theoretical breakthrough occurs",
    ", with the appearance of some new analytical or numerical method which can finally settle these issues , researchers in this field will keep an attentive eye in new experimental results which can provide some clue about the true nature of the dynamics of charge carriers in an af background .    in this respect ,",
    "a recent experimental development has renewed interest in this subject : neutron scattering @xcite , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite , and nmr @xcite experiments have shown that the application of an external magnetic field can change the relative presence of two of the most fundamental order parameters in the cuprates : af and sc orders .",
    "the presence of the first being enhanced at the expense of the second . apparently , extensive regions of af order ( centered in the vortex cores ) were observed to develop as the strength of the magnetic field increases .",
    "this seems to be true for different materials ( ybco , lsco and bssco ) at different doping concentrations @xcite .",
    "although a complete experimental picture has not yet emerged , the neutron scattering experiments in optimaly doped lsco , for example , have indicated a substantial increase of inelastic scattering intensity at low energy transfers with increasing magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this seems to imply that the field induces slowly fluctuating af spin correlations .",
    "however , several questions still remain : is this effect generic to all cuprate families at all dopings ? in what circumstances",
    "is the field - induced magnetism static and when is it dynamic ? and very importantly , is the field - induced af magnetism restricted to the vortex cores or is it present everywhere in the system ?",
    "so(5 ) theories @xcite had predicted the possibility of antiferromagnetism inside the vortex cores in cuprates @xcite .",
    "the qualitative idea is that once superconductivity is suppressed , either by impurities or magnetic field , af order should be enhanced .",
    "in addition , after the above mentioned experiments , mean - field calculations in effective hubbard - like hamiltonians produced results in agreement with this qualitative idea @xcite .",
    "this however comes as no surprise , since these effective hamiltonians already include explicitly a term for pairing and an on - site coulomb repulsion , which favors af order . for these mean - field calculations ,",
    "one expects that the suppression of one order will automatically lead to the enhancement of the other .",
    "qpt theories , on the other hand , state that the above experiments are indication that the superconducting phase is in the vicinity of a bulk qpt to a state with microscopic coexistence of superconducting and spin density wave orders @xcite .",
    "it is also claimed that the stm results showing the appearance of charge density wave order can be accounted for by qpt - type theories @xcite .",
    "two of the most popular models for the cuprates are the @xmath0 and hubbard models .",
    "much of what is known about how charge carriers move in an af two - dimensional ( 2d ) background was obtained through their analysis .",
    "prominent among the methods used for that are numerical techniques @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no non - mean - field calculations of a strongly correlated hamiltonian ( hubbard- or @xmath0-like ) have been performed to analyze the effect of an external magnetic field upon the spin correlations .",
    "previous numerical results for small square clusters were concentrated in the issues of spin - charge separation @xcite and magnetic susceptibility of the ground state @xcite , but neither work analyzed the evolution of spin - spin correlations with the external magnetic field . unfortunately , these two works called very little attention . one of the reasons may have been the fact that they were published before the main experimental results showing the effect of the magnetic field were performed .",
    "another factor is the difficulty , mainly after introducing the magnetic field , of performing finite - size scaling analysis for square clusters , a necessary step in ascertaining any claims based on the numerical results @xcite .",
    "there is however an alternative route in obtaining credible numerical results which can extend these two previous works , and provide some clues about the overall problem of charge carrier dynamics in an af background : performing the calculations in @xmath9 ladders . for some time already ,",
    "2-leg ladders have been a fruitful testing ground for the numerical study of strongly correlated models relevant to the cuprates @xcite .",
    "this is especially true for exact diagonalization ( ed ) calculations , where the quasi - unidimensional aspect of ladders makes it feasible the study of finite - size effects , providing credibility to the results @xcite .",
    "besides that , given the above mentioned difficulty in extracting uncontroversial conclusions from numerical results obtained for square clusters ( with either ed or density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite methods ) , some of the more solid numerical results obtained for two - leg ladders have been qualitatively ` translated ' into the 2d cuprate arena @xcite .    in this paper , the authors present zero - temperature ed calculations for the @xmath0 model with a magnetic field in hole - doped 2-leg ladders .",
    "all the calculations for ladders were done adopting periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) along the legs .",
    "the results show that the diamagnetic response of the system leads to a strengthening of the rung spin correlations .",
    "this can be described in qualitative terms as a reinforcement of the spin liquid ( sl ) character of the 2-leg ladder ground state . in light of our conclusions for 2-leg ladders , and in keeping with the spirit of the discussion in the previous paragraph , the authors also performed calculations in small square clusters . the ed results for @xmath3 clusters presented intriguing results : the calculation of spin correlations for different values of @xmath4 , different dopings ( 1 and 2 holes ) , and using different boundary conditions ( pbc and open boundary conditions ( obc ) ) seem to indicate that the movement of the holes , under the influence of the external field , promotes the appearance of an sl state in the spin background .",
    "this is consistent with the results for ladders ; however , in the square clusters this sl state has to compete with the zero - field af short - range - order ( sro ) characteristic of doped cuprates .",
    "although the results are not conclusive @xcite , they point to a possible new example of competition between different ground states in a strongly correlated model related to the cuprates @xcite . the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , a brief description of the peierls transformation",
    "then , in section 3 , results are presented for 2-leg ladders , followed by results for a @xmath3 cluster .",
    "summary , conclusions and prospects for future work are presented in the last section .",
    "the magnetic field is introduced in the @xmath0 model through a peierls transformation : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a fermionic annihilation operator with double occupied states projected out , @xmath12 indicates that the summations include only nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites , and @xmath13 stands for the spin degree of freedom .",
    "the phase in the hopping term can be written , using a landau gauge @xmath14 , as @xmath15 and the magnetic field @xmath16 is related to the dimensionless flux per plaquette through @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the unit flux quantum and @xmath19 is the lattice parameter @xcite .",
    "it is important to remark that , as one of the main objectives of the present work is to gain insight into the dynamics of charge carriers introduced into an af background , the calculations concentrate in the diamagnetic response of the charge carriers to the external field , and will therefore omit the zeeman term . for laboratory - strength magnetic fields ,",
    "this can be considered a reasonable approximation to the actual experimental situation . however , for the calculations presented here , mainly for square clusters , where the fields involved can be quite substantial @xcite , the zeeman term would have to be taken in account if one wishes to make any connection to the experimental results mentioned above @xcite .",
    "as it is well known @xcite , the spin sector in ladders is gapped and therefore presents the exponential decay of af spin correlations in the leg direction , characteristic of a sl state . in a qualitative sense ,",
    "the sl character of the undoped ground state in ladders can be described as a collection of rung - singlets @xcite .",
    "this picture survives doping with holes up to a moderate concentration @xcite .",
    "therefore , to obtain a qualitative understanding of how the magnetic field affects the zero - field ground state , correlations between spins in the same rung ( from now on called rung correlations ) were calculated as a function of field . in figure 1a",
    "it is shown the evolution with field ( in terms of @xmath20 ) of the rung correlations in a @xmath21 ladder with 1 hole , for @xmath22 and @xmath5 .",
    "it can be seen that there is a substantial increase of the rung correlations , while correlations for spins farther apart than @xmath23 are always smaller than the zero - field value ( see below ) . as the magnetic field influence on the spin background",
    "is being assessed through the hole movement , one would expect a more pronounced effect at lower values of @xmath4 , when the hole has higher mobility and is more effective in driving the behavior of the spin background . as can be observed by comparing results for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the increase of the spin correlations",

    "figures 1b and 1c compare the results for @xmath24 and @xmath31 in a @xmath28 ladder with 1 hole , for @xmath29 .",
    "the thickness of the lines is proportional to the absolute value of the correlations ( all correlations displayed are af ) . for zero - field ( figure 1b ) one can see the distortion in the spin background caused by the presence of the hole ( open circle in the figure ) : the rungs adjacent to the hole have their spin correlations substantially decreased , in comparison with rungs far away from it , which display correlations similar to the ones in the rungs of undoped ladders . for smaller values of @xmath4",
    "the distortion of the spin background extends to larger distances , consistent with the higher mobility of the hole @xcite .",
    "the application of the magnetic field , as can be seen in figure 1c , affects drastically the zero - field spin background : all rungs close to the projected hole have their af spin correlations enhanced , particularly the ones adjacent to the hole , when compared to the zero - field values @xcite .",

    ", it is shown at the bottom of figure 1c a line which is representative of the rung correlations of an _ undoped _ @xmath28 ladder , showing that some of the rung correlations for @xmath30 are even larger than in the undoped system .",
    "similar calculations for smaller ladders ( @xmath32 ) produce very similar results , indicating that any size effects present are small and do not affect the qualitative description of the results .    regarding size effects",
    ", one should note that , at zero - field for @xmath29 ( figure 1b ) , rungs as far as 3 lattice spacings from the projected hole are affected , having their spin correlations _ decreased _ as compared to the undoped ladder .",
    "the fact that this differs very little from @xmath33 results indicates that at zero - field the results are quite well converged for a @xmath28 ladder . at finite - field ( figure 1c ) , the distortion caused by the field , i.e. , the _ increase _ in the rung correlations when compared to the zero - field results , has approximately the same reach ( 3 lattice spacings from the projected hole ) , indicating that the results seem well converged also with field for a @xmath28 ladder .",
    "now , results are presented for different ladder sizes . in figure 2a",
    "it is shown how the rung correlations evolve for increasing ladder sizes ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) in the single - hole case .",
    "although the comparison is not intended as a true finite - size - scaling analysis , since the hole doping decreases from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , it indicates that the magnetic field effect does not seem to vanish as @xmath38 increases .",
    "as discussed already in connection with figure 1c , the @xmath29 single - hole calculations in a @xmath28 ladder are already representative of qualitative bulk behavior at low doping",

    ", they tend to stay as far as possible from each other and a calculation of spin correlations shows that the ` strong rung - singlets ' picture still holds . in figure 3a , results are shown for pair - pair correlations @xcite at zero- and finite - field for a @xmath21 ladder with 2 holes and @xmath29 .",
    "the results clearly show the pair - breaking effect of the magnetic field , as well as the loss of coherence in the pair propagation along the ladder .",
    "our calculations also indicate that the presence of the magnetic field makes it energetically favorable for the pair to break and for the spin background to form strong rung - singlets , in contrast to zero - field , where the preferred configuration is the formation of a bound - pair , where the holes are separated by @xmath42 with a strong _ across - the - diagonal _ af spin correlation @xcite .",
    "figure 3b shows the variation with field of the across - the - diagonal spin correlation ( denoted as * d * ) for a @xmath21 ladder with 2 holes and @xmath39 .",
    "the suppression of the across - the - diagonal correlation by the field partially explains the pair - breaking effect . compared to @xmath24",
    ", the value of * d * for @xmath45 has decreased in half .",
    "this is accompanied by an increase in the average separation of the two holes . in figure 3c ( again for @xmath21 , 2 holes , @xmath29 ) , after one hole is projected at an arbitrary site , results are shown for the density @xmath46 of the second hole at two different distances from the projected hole .",
    "the squares indicate results for distance @xmath43 ( most probable hole configuration at zero - field ) and the circles for @xmath44 ( most probable hole configuration at high - field ) . at this point , the following observation is appropriate : at first sight , it appears counterintuitive that at finite - field the pair will be broken .",
    "after all , the single - hole results above have shown that the field has increased the overall strength of the rung correlations . and",
    "by using an argument based on the optimization of the ground state energy , it seems reasonable that the second hole would pair - up with the first one in the same rung , thus minimizing the number of broken af bonds in the rungs .",
    "however , as it was shown in the ( zero - field ) numerical work of white and scalapino @xcite , the structure of the pair is more complicated .",
    "it is not only the magnetic energy that has to be optimized ; the kinetic energy of the two holes has to be taken in account also : their ability to hop from a @xmath42 configuration ( when they are positioned in the diagonal of a plaquette ) to a minimum distance configuration ( positioned in one of the rungs of the same plaquette ) is more important than just minimizing the number of broken af bonds in the rungs .",
    "one evidence being the fact that ( for values of @xmath4 around 0.4 ) the @xmath42 configuration for the holes is more probable than a same- rung configuration . and , as found out by white and scalapino @xcite , the matrix element of the hopping term between these two configurations is critically dependent on the existence of a strong af bond in one diagonal of the plaquette when the holes are in the @xmath42 configuration , occupying the other diagonal .",
    "one has therefore the picture at zero - field of a pair of holes ` straddling ' the af bond formed in one of the diagonals of a plaquette .",

    "it is natural to expect that , whatever the effect introduced by the magnetic field , the lowering of the total spin of the ground state to its minimum value should be associated with the development of af correlations . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "nn spin correlations in the @xmath49 sector were calculated for @xmath61 with 1 hole in a @xmath3 cluster @xcite .",
    "the results are presented in figure 4b , where it is shown that the magnetic field initially turns the ferromagnetic nn spin correlations into af correlations and gradually enhances them .",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath57 , indicating that it is not the gain in magnetic energy which drives the increase in the nn af correlations .",
    "the results at higher values of @xmath4 are similar to the ones in figure 4b , _ but only up to @xmath62_. a small increase in the nn af correlations can be achieved at higher values of field ( @xmath63 ) up to @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , from the single - hole results at small values of @xmath4 it is clear that the field ( when only the diamagnetic response is included in the hamiltonian ) is able to change radically the character of the ground state : from fully polarized to minimum polarization .",
    "however , this effect is gradually weakened , until it is no more present , as @xmath4 increases .",
    "it is well known from the early numerical studies and from photoemission measurements @xcite that the hole bandwidth is strongly renormalized by @xmath65 .",
    "as mentioned in the ladder discussions above , the size of the region ( in the spin background ) affected by the hole presence decreases as @xmath4 increases . in the limit",
    "where @xmath66 , an injected hole would be unable to move @xcite .",
    "as the field effect is caused by the hole movement , it is natural to expect that it will become weaker as the ability of the hole to move is degraded by the stiffening of the spin background with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "however , a value of @xmath67 , although already introducing very short - range af fluctuations in the spin background , still allows the hole a fair amount of freedom to move around the @xmath3 cluster .",
    "therefore , it is puzzling that the effect of the field in the nn correlations is already negligible for @xmath64 .",
    "( however , as is going to be shown later , the effect is more resilient at longer distances ) .",
    "one possible explanation for the existence of a threshold at @xmath64 in the field effect is that the hole movement under the influence of the field tries to induce a ground state with a _ qualitatively different _ spin background than the one at zero - field , and this sets in a competition between different ground states .",
    "for very small @xmath4 , where the zero - field ground state is the nagaoka phase @xcite , the new ` order ' ( imposed by the field and characterized by minimum polarization ) quickly dominates .",
    "it is well known that the nagaoka phase is very delicate and that small perturbations are able to drive the system out of it .",

    "however , for values of @xmath4 where the @xmath3 cluster at zero - field has already moved out of the nagaoka phase , to a more robust ground state , the field is not able to impose its new type of ` order ' to all distances .",

    "it can be easily seen that the field enhances the nn af spin correlations also for obc , showing that the effect here presented is not dependent on boundary conditions .        before looking into the effect of the field in the longer range correlations ,",
    "a discussion will be presented of how the zero - field static magnetic correlations at different dopings are described through ed calculations in a @xmath3 cluster .",
    "it is our belief that the presentation of a somewhat detailed account of how the zero - field magnetic ground state in the @xmath3 cluster evolves with doping from af long - range - order ( lro ) to af sro will clarify the description and interpretation of the finite - field results @xcite . in figure 6a ,",
    "correlations between spins at different distances are shown for a @xmath3 cluster at different dopings at zero - field , for @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "squares show spin correlations at zero - doping , and diamonds and circles display spin correlations for 1 and 2 holes , respectively .",
    "it is well know , through calculations using different methods @xcite , that the heisenberg model in two dimensions ( to which the @xmath0 model at zero - doping is equivalent ) presents af lro at zero temperature ( 2d nel order ) .",
    "static _ order translates , in a plot of spin correlations as a function of distance between spins , into a finite - value plateau at long distances . because of the limited distances available in a @xmath3 cluster , the results in figure 6a for zero - doping ( squares ) only display a _",
    "tendency _ to level off and form a plateau @xcite .",
    "what would then be expected as the @xmath3 cluster is doped with the first hole ?",
    "it is well known from several experimental results @xcite , that the nel phase ( af lro ) is destroyed for a hole concentration @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , for a doping of @xmath36 ( @xmath74 ) , one would naively expect the spin correlations in the @xmath0 model to display no trace of antiferromagnetism .",
    "however , the numerical results seem to indicate otherwise : judging from the curve for @xmath74 ( diamonds ) in figure 6a , one would say that there are still quite robust af tendencies in the doped system . in reality , this is in agreement with experimental results , mainly neutron scattering @xcite , which describe this situation as af sro . in the cuprates ,",
    "an af exchange interaction between the copper oxide planes leads to three - dimensional ( 3d ) nel order with a transition temperature @xmath75 ( at zero - doping ) .",
    "it is this 3d order which quickly fades away at around @xmath76 and is represented by a narrow strip close to zero - doping in the phase diagram for the cuprates .",
    "however , strong af correlations remain in the copper oxide plane .",
    "the energy spectra of these af correlations ( its fluctuations at different frequencies ) has a very rich structure and a very complex dependence with doping .",
    "in addition , several aspects of the experimental results are not yet settled , different cuprate families presenting different results . however , due to the very strong af exchange interaction between the copper spins in the planes , it is not totally surprising that af scattering of some sort will be present in neutron experiments at dopings considerably higher than @xmath76 .",
    "this surviving magnetism is generally referred to as af sro , and it is thought by many to play a very important role in defining the properties of the cuprates for a wide region of the phase diagram .",
    "it can survive to moderate dopings , well into the metallic phase @xcite .",
    "it is this af sro which is displayed by the somewhat robust 1 hole spin correlation results ( diamonds ) in figure 6a .",
    "early ed results have shown that the @xmath0 model is able to capture this crucial property of the cuprates @xcite . when a second hole is introduced in the @xmath3 cluster ( @xmath77 ) the spin correlations ( circles ) become ferromagnetic for the longest distance available in the cluster ( namely , @xmath78 ) and",
    "are very close to zero for @xmath79 .",
    "this is again in good agreement with neutron scattering results , where the correlation length @xmath80 of the af sro decreases with doping @xmath46 approximately as @xmath81 . not coincidentally",
    ", this formula also describes the variation with @xmath46 of the average separation between holes @xcite . at moderate doping",
    ", @xmath80 can be indeed very short : in the metallic state of lsco , for @xmath82 , one has that @xmath83 , which corresponds to approximately two lattice parameters .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the results for @xmath77 ( circles ) in figure 6a , since the distance where the correlations turn from af to ferromagnetic provides an estimate of @xmath80 .",
    "this discussion then shows that , despite the small size of the cluster analyzed , one can obtain reliable qualitative information , through the @xmath0 model , about some aspects of the magnetism in the ground state of the cuprates .",
    "results are shown at zero - doping and with one and two holes , at zero- and finite - field .",
    "( a ) results for @xmath67 at zero - field .",
    "squares : zero - doping , showing for a small square cluster how the af lro ( 2d nel order ) is displayed .",
    "the tendency of the spin correlations to form a plateau at larger distances is an indication of the af lro expected at the thermodynamic limit .",
    "diamonds : results for 1 hole ( @xmath74 ) indicate the transition from nel order to af sro at finite doping . although the correlation length is now finite , it is clearly larger than the cluster size .",
    "circles : results for 2 holes ( @xmath77 ) indicate that the nn af correlation is substantially decreased if compared with the zero - doping case and that the correlations for larger distances are very close to zero ( at a distance of @xmath84 the correlation becomes ferromagnetic ) .",
    "this indicates that the correlation length of the af sro is of the order of the cluster size .",
    "( b ) variation of the spin correlations with distance and field in a @xmath3 cluster with 2 holes and @xmath85 .",

    "( c ) comparison of spin correlations for @xmath67 with 2 holes at zero- and finite - field .",
    "notice that besides decreasing the correlation length , the field also increases markedly the nn af correlation , in contrast with results for @xmath86 .",
    "this suggests that at low values of @xmath4 the field induces a _ qualitatively _ different ground state .",
    ", width=377 ]      the discussion now turns to examining how _ longer range spin correlations _ are affected by the field . in the ladder results above",
    ", it was shown that spin correlations at larger distances than @xmath42 were decreased by the external field @xcite .",
    "what are the results for square clusters ?",
    "although the authors are currently working on extensions and improvements of the present calculations @xcite , for now a tentative picture can be summarized as follows .",
    "as mentioned already , the nn spin correlations increase substantially with field at low values of @xmath4 , although this increase is suppressed for higher values of @xmath4 , becoming negligible for @xmath87 , in a @xmath3 cluster with 2 holes . however , non - negligible field effects are present , up to @xmath88 , for all distances larger than nn . above @xmath89 , the field effect at larger distances than nn is quite systematic , as can be seen in figure 6b for @xmath85 , in a @xmath3 cluster with 2 holes ( @xmath77 ) : the less af the correlation is , i.e. , the larger the distance between the spins , the larger is the decrease caused by the field , clearly showing the tendency of the field of trying to decrease the range of the af sro . however , it is important to notice that , for this value of @xmath4 , the field effect in the nn correlation is virtually zero .",
    "therefore , for values of @xmath4 where one would expect the af sro state to be quite robust , the field does not alter the qualitative aspects of the ground state .",
    "this picture remains essentially true down to @xmath89 . below this value of @xmath4",
    ", there is a qualitative difference in the field effect , since there is a marked _ increase _ with field in the nn af correlations .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure 6c , where results at zero- ( circles ) and finite - field ( triangles ) for @xmath67 with 2 holes in a @xmath3 cluster clearly show the change from af to ferro of the spin correlation at distance @xmath79 and the pronounced increase of the nn af correlation caused by the field .",
    "the effect at larger distances can be still described as the field forcing a decrease in the correlation length , but the sharp increase in the nn af correlation leads us to believe , motivated by the ladder results , that the finite - field ground state is _ qualitatively different _ from the zero - field ground state .",
    "the tentative use of the term _ spin liquid _ has its motivation more in the effect of the field in the nn correlations than in the longer range ones .",
    "the dependence of the results with hole doping and @xmath4 seems to be consistent with a sl - af sro competition .",
    "therefore , this effect could be yet another example of competition between different ground states relevant to the cuprates @xcite .",
    "and for vanishingly small hole concentration , therefore the phase boundary intercepts the origin .",
    ", width=377 ]    an schematic phase diagram at finite - field is displayed in figure 7 .",
    "the main results obtained numerically for the 2d @xmath0 model in the presence of a perpendicular field are presented in a succinct way . in the left region , for high @xmath4 ( vertical axis ) and small @xmath46 ( horizontal axis ) ,",
    "the ground state presents af sro . starting from a point inside the left - side region , as one increases @xmath4 and/or decreases @xmath46 ( at constant field ) the correlation length @xmath80 of the af sro increases ( the system is drawn away from the phase boundary ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath4 decreases and/or @xmath46 increases , a new ground state with sl characteristics is eventually established ( the system crosses the phase boundary to the right - side region ) . an increase ( decrease ) of the field",
    "will rotate the phase boundary counter - clockwise ( clockwise ) , enlarging the sl ( af sro ) phase and squeezing the af sro ( sl ) phase .",
    "it is interesting to note that the effect observed in @xmath3 clusters and 2-leg ladders is also present in a @xmath6 plaquette with 1 and 2 holes .",
    "as expected , there are qualitative differences : the increase with field in nn af correlations in a @xmath6 plaquette is directly proportional to @xmath4 ( therefore it vanishes at @xmath57 @xcite ) and it is an order of magnitude smaller than the increase observed in ladders and @xmath3 clusters .",
    "current efforts are underway to try to connect the results in @xmath6 to the results described in this paper and possibly gain a qualitative understanding of the magnetic field effect @xcite .",
    "in summary , ed calculations in 2-leg ladders and small square clusters have shown that applying a perpendicular magnetic field to the @xmath0 model at low doping tends to induce an sl - like state . in 2-leg ladders ,",
    "the zero - field sl ground state is reinforced by the field , independently of @xmath4 and doping .",
    "pair breaking caused by the field is clearly observed in ladders and its origin seems to be associated to the decrease with field in the across - the - diagonal af spin correlation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in 2d this sl state has to compete with the zero - field af sro .",
    "the spin correlations of the true ground state will then depend on the field strength , the value of @xmath4 and density of charge carriers .",
    "interestingly enough , the field effect can be observed in clusters as small as a @xmath6 plaquette . as the hamiltonian in equation ( 1 )",
    "can be diagonalized analytically in a @xmath6 cluster , a qualitative understanding of the physical origin of the increase of the af nn correlations may be achieved through a careful analysis of the eigenfunctions .",
    "one additional avenue of research worth investigating is how the results here presented will change if hoppings beyond nn are taken in account @xcite .    because of the small size of the @xmath3 cluster , the authors abstain of making any connection between the results here presented and the experimental results mentioned in the introduction",
    "however , given the relevance of the subject and the lack of calculations including the magnetic field in strongly correlated models like the @xmath0 and hubbard , the authors firmly believe that the results so far presented will stimulate further investigations . in particular , our results predict that an increase in the spin gap of doped ladders with applied field should be experimentally observable .",
