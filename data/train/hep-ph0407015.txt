    "the two body non - leptonic transitions have played a very important role in exploring the @xmath0 violation through @xmath13-meson decays and in shaping both the sides and the three angles @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the unitarity triangle ( ut ) of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite ( for a detailed review , see @xcite ) . in the wolfenstein parametrization @xcite of the ckm matrix , characterized by the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the three inner angles of the ut are defined as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the perturbatively improved wolfenstein parameters  @xcite . thanks to the precise measurements at the current @xmath13-factories , babar ( slac ) and belle ( kek ) , @xmath0 violation could recently be established with the help of the `` gold - plated '' mode @xmath26  @xcite , leading to a precise measurement of @xmath27 , where the current world average yields  @xcite @xmath28    in contrast to the well measured ckm angle @xmath17 , the other two angles @xmath16 and @xmath18 are poorly known at present and their determinations is more challenging  @xcite .",
    "happily , the current thrust of the @xmath13-factories is now on the extractions of the other two angles , which will be measured through the @xmath0 violation in the charmless @xmath13 decays , such as @xmath29 and similar modes  @xcite .",
    "however , in this case the extraction of weak phases is complicated by the so - called penguin pollution , leading to a hadronic model dependent estimate of the @xmath0 asymmetries in these modes .",
    "an alternative approach to this problem is the use of symmetry arguments , such as the isospin or the @xmath12-symmetry , however this is very challenging from an experimental point of view .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the extraction of ckm parameters from the time - dependent @xmath0 violation , both mixing - induced @xmath30 and direct @xmath31 , in @xmath1 decay , which is related to @xmath14 by interchanging all down and strange quarks , i.e.  through the @xmath32-spin subgroup of the @xmath12-flavour - symmetry of strong interactions . to some extent theoretical input on the penguin - to - tree ratio",
    "will be needed and can be provided by the qcd factorization approach@xcite .",
    "however , we will show that the impact of uncertainties , especially those arising from the penguin phase , in the calculation is in fact negligeable .",
    "moreover , even if the model - dependent assumptions on the penguin parameters are ignored , it is still possible to get useful informations on these parameters using @xmath0 violation observables and the @xmath33 mixing phase .",
    "another possibility is the use of the current @xmath14 experimental measurements via the @xmath32-spin symmetry in order to explore the future impact of the @xmath1 on the extraction of ckm parameters .",
    "although this strategy is not affected by any hadronic assumptions , its theoretical accuracy is limited by @xmath32-spin - breaking corrections . in order to make uses of these methods , dedicated @xmath13 physics experiments at hadron colliders , tevatron and lhc ,",
    "will provide the adequate testing places for such decays .    to make our analysis more transparent we propose the following strategy . after isolating systematically the hadronic quantities , namely the pure penguin amplitude @xmath34 and the strong phase @xmath9 , from ckm parameters in the penguin - to - tree - ratio amplitude",
    ", we express the time - dependent @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath1 in terms of wolfenstein parameters @xmath7 , hadronic quantities @xmath8 and the @xmath33 mixing phase @xmath6 . combining them with the precise measurement of the `` gold - plated '' @xmath26 observable @xmath27 , useful informations on the unitarity triangle , @xmath7 , and penguin parameters could be extracted . to make our investigation more predictive , we use the current @xmath13-factories measurements on @xmath14 modes to extrapolate the forthcoming physics potential of the @xmath35 systems at future hadron machines .",
    "to illustrate this scenario , we have supplied from qcd sum rules the corresponding @xmath12-symmetry - breaking factor . to reinforce the validity of this approximation",
    ", we have tested systematically the @xmath12-breaking effects within the qcd factorization framework .",
    "the utility of @xmath1 to probe ckm phases was already the subject of extensive works  , where various strategies have been carried out in order to constrain theoretical uncertainties .",
    "our new strategy proposed here consists of isolating the penguin quantities @xmath34 and @xmath9 from the ckm parameters in order to explore in a clean way the potential information of @xmath0 violation observables , namely @xmath36 and @xmath37 , combined with @xmath27 and the @xmath33 mixing phase @xmath6 in the determination of the ut .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , a completely general parameterization of the @xmath0 violation observables in @xmath1 is collected , in terms of pure hadronic quantities @xmath8 and the ckm parameters . using the qcd factorization framework , we discuss the estimate of @xmath1 penguin parameters in sec .  3 .",
    "in sec .  4 , we explore the determination of the ut , from both the mixing - induced and direct @xmath0 violation parameters , @xmath27 and the @xmath33 mixing phase @xmath6 .",
    "the implications for the allowed contours in the @xmath34-@xmath9 planes fixed through the @xmath0-violating observables are as well discussed .",
    "this alternative possibility is useful if new physics ( np ) affects the @xmath33 mixing phase .",
    "sec .  5 explores the implications of the current @xmath14 @xmath13-factories measurements in extrapolating the physics potential of the @xmath35 decays at future hadron colliders , using the @xmath12-flavour - symmetry .",
    "this strategy is only affected by the @xmath12-symmetry - breaking corrections . an estimate of these effects is investigated in more detail within the qcd factorization framework . finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "the time - dependent @xmath0 asymmetry in @xmath35 decays is defined by @xmath38 where : @xmath39 with @xmath40 defines the hadronic contribution in our decay mode .",
    "the phase @xmath41 denotes the @xmath33 mixing phase . within the standard model ( sm )",
    ", we have @xmath42 due to a cabibbo suppression of @xmath43 @xmath44 , implying that @xmath6 is very small much larger than the sm expectation of @xmath43@xmath45 would be a strong indication for np contributions to @xmath33 mixing .",
    "] , which could be extracted using the @xmath46 mode @xcite .    in terms of the wolfenstein parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 the ckm phase factors read @xmath49 on the other hand , the penguin - to - tree ratio @xmath50 , defined in ( [ scxi ] ) , can be written as @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the cabibbo angle .",
    "the real parameters @xmath34 and @xmath9 defined in this way are pure strong interaction quantities without further dependence on ckm variables .    for any given values of @xmath34 and @xmath9",
    "a measurement of @xmath54 defines a curve in the ( @xmath47 , @xmath48)-plane . using the relations above this constraint",
    "is given by the equation @xmath55 where @xmath56 and similarly the relation between @xmath57 and ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) reads @xmath58    if there were no penguin amplitude @xmath59 , then @xmath60 would be given by the pure phase @xmath61 . in that case , @xmath57 would vanish and @xmath54 would provide a clear determination of the phase @xmath18 .",
    "however , the presence of the penguin amplitude spoils this determination .",
    "in this section we discuss theoretical calculations of the penguin contribution in @xmath35 . at the quark level , the charmless hadronic decay @xmath62 can be described in terms of the effective weak hamiltonian , obtained by integrating out the top quark and @xmath63 bosons : @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the left - handed current ",
    "current operators arising from @xmath63 bosons exchange , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are qcd and electroweak penguin operators , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the electromagnetic and chromomagnetic dipole operators .",
    "they are given by    @xmath70    where @xmath71 , @xmath72 are colour indices , @xmath73 are the electric charges of the quarks in units of @xmath74 , and a summation over @xmath75 is implied . the definition of the dipole operators @xmath68 and @xmath69 corresponds to the sign convention @xmath76 for the gauge - covariant derivative .",
    "the wilson coefficients are calculated at a high scale @xmath77 and evolved down to a characteristic scale @xmath78 using next - to - leading order renormalization - group equations  @xcite .",
    "the ckm factors are here denoted by @xmath79 .      when the qcd factorization approach  @xcite is applied to",
    "the charmless decays @xmath35 , the hadronic matrix elements of the effective weak hamiltonian can be written in the form : @xmath80 the above @xmath81 are the factorized hadronic matrix elements , which have the same definitions as those in the naive factorization ( nf ) approach @xcite .",
    "the `` nonfactorizable '' effects are included in the process dependent coefficients @xmath82 which include the @xmath83 corrections from hard gluon exchanges in the weak matrix elements , namely the vertex corrections and the hard spectator scattering .",
    "a new class of power corrections that need to be considered here are the uncalculable weak annihilation contributions @xmath84 in ( [ fact ] ) , which are parametrized as phenomenological quantities within the qcdf approach @xcite .",
    "explicit expressions for the qcd coefficients @xmath82 and the weak annihilation parameters @xmath84 can be found in @xcite .    neglecting the very small effects from electroweak penguin contributions in ( [ fact ] )",
    ", one can express the penguin parameter @xmath85 in the form @xcite @xmath86 } {   a_1+a^u_4 + r^k_\\chi a^u_6 + r_a[b_1+b_3 + 2 b_4 ] } , \\ ] ] where the quantities @xmath87 and @xmath88 are defined by @xmath89 @xmath87 is defined in terms of the @xmath90 quark masses @xmath91 and depends on the renormalization scale @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath93 is a @xmath94 transition form factor , evaluated at momentum transfer @xmath95 .",
    "both quantities in ( [ rchira ] ) are formally of order @xmath96 in the heavy - quark limit . however , whereas @xmath97 is indeed very small , @xmath98 is numerically large .",
    "consequently weak annihilation effects are @xmath96 suppressed and penguin contributions ( including the uncalculable hard spectator terms ) @xmath99 enhanced .",
    "thus , an estimate of these `` chirally - enhanced '' corrections is necessary in exploring the phenomenology of nonleptonic @xmath13 decays .      [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     adding the errors in quadrature , one obtains @xmath100 where the first ( second ) errors are from the first ( second ) class of uncertainties . combining both in quadrature",
    "we finally get : @xmath101 in the case of non - universality of hard spectator scattering and weak annihilations terms and @xmath102 . ] , we pick the corresponding @xmath103 value for the pion mode and allow the corresponding parameters to vary by @xmath104 for the kaon mode . we find that the @xmath12-breaking effect on the ratio of penguin amplitudes ( [ def - qcdfsu3 ] ) can be large up to @xmath105 in magnitude , with a complete dominance from the annihilation contributions .",
    "we conclude that @xmath106 is at present poorly determined by qcd factorization . therefore to get control over its estimate , a better understanding of the weak annihilation part is in order .",
    "we have investigated the impact of the forthcoming measurements of the time - dependent @xmath0 asymmetry parameters , namely @xmath11 and @xmath10 in @xmath107 decays , on the extraction of weak phases , which will soon become accessible at hadron machines , namely tevatron run - ii , btev and lhc - b .",
    "we shall conclude by summarizing our main results as follows .",
    "an efficient use of mixing - induced @xmath0 violation in @xmath107 decays , measured by @xmath11 , can be made by combining it with the corresponding observable from @xmath26 , namely @xmath3 , the @xmath4@xmath5 mixing phase @xmath6 and the hadronic penguin parameters @xmath8 in extracting the ckm parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "looking more closely , to their dependences on hadronic parameters , it turns out that the sensitivity of @xmath48 on the strong phase @xmath9 is very weak , which is entering in @xmath48 at second order , implying a negligible effect for its moderate values .",
    "consequently a simple determination of the ut from @xmath108 and @xmath11 is possible since the dependence of @xmath48 on @xmath34 is proportional to an overall factor @xmath109 .",
    "moreover , if the @xmath110@xmath111 mixing phase @xmath112 is fixed through @xmath26 , then possible @xmath0-violating np contributions to @xmath113@xmath114 mixing may shift the range for the mixing - induced @xmath0 violation observable @xmath11 ( but not @xmath10 ) significantly . to illustrate this scenario , we have presented contour plots , allowing us to distinguish between the sm and np scenario . in this case , np signal in the @xmath4@xmath5 mixing would be provided by a sizeable contribution either from the angular distribution analysis of @xmath115 and @xmath116 decays or from the @xmath0-violating asymmetries in @xmath117 and @xmath118 systems .",
    "in addition to @xmath11 , a complementary information from the direct @xmath0 violation parameter @xmath10 are investigated .",
    "although its dependence on hadronic input is more pronounced than for @xmath11 , it constraints significantly the dynamical quantities @xmath34 and @xmath9 .",
    "interestingly , we find for the conservative bound @xmath119 a strong constraint on @xmath120 could be obtained , independently on the strong phase @xmath9 .    as an input to the phenomenological discussion we also studied the calculation of the penguin parameters @xmath34 and @xmath9 in qcd .",
    "we have analyzed @xmath34 and @xmath9 within qcd factorization with a particular view on theoretical uncertainties implying a large uncertainty due to the unknown annihilation contributions . an alternative way to explore these penguin parameters",
    "is using the plausible assumption based on the @xmath12-flavour - symmetry of strong interactions .",
    "thus , one can complement the @xmath0-violating observables of @xmath107 in a variety of ways with the current @xmath13-factories data provided by @xmath121 channels .",
    "interestingly , we show that the dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath122 fixed through the @xmath0-violating observables @xmath123 and the @xmath12-symmetry - breaking factor @xmath124 , implies a positive value of @xmath122 ( see fig .  [ fig : rskk ] ) . moreover , the sensitivity on the @xmath12-symmetry - breaking factor @xmath125 in determining @xmath48 as function of @xmath122 , fixed through the @xmath0-violating observable @xmath126 , is found rather mild for @xmath127 .",
    "to reinforce the validity of our approximation , we have analyzed the @xmath12-symmetry - breaking factor @xmath125 within qcd factorization with a particular view on theoretical uncertainties .",
