    "among others , wouthuysen field ( wf ) effect due to the lyman alpha ( ly-@xmath1 ) radiation emitted from the primordial stars is expected to be the first important process for igm , which couples the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen to the color temperature of ly-@xmath1 radiation @xcite . in the typical environments of igm , color temperature of ly-@xmath1 radiation field couples with kinetic temperature of igm because of the large ly-@xmath1 scattering rate .",

    "[ fig : bispectrum_component_equilateral ] , we plot the brightness temperature bispectrum and the above auto - bispectra terms for equilateral type as functions of redshift ( upper panels ) . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the total bispectra are mostly contributed from the auto - bispectra of the matter density field , the fluctuations of the spin temperature and the neutral fraction , which are expressed as the first three terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bispectrum_component ] ) , for all redshifts . for comparison , the evolution of power spectra is also shown ( lower panels ) and we find that the behavior of each component is very similar between bispectrum and power spectrum .",
    "such a correspondence is highly non trivial , since the bispectrum and power spectrum reflect different aspects of the statistical properties of the fluctuations as we have mentioned .",
    "let us try to interpret the behavior of bispectra , comparing that of power spectra which was detailed in our previous work @xcite .",
    "first , fluctuations in neutral hydrogen fraction appear when reionization begins and become dominant as reionization proceeds ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the dip at @xmath86 corresponds to the redshift when the average spin temperature becomes equal to the cmb temperature and the average brightness temperature @xmath87 vanishes .",
    "this dip appears in the contribution of matter fluctuations for the same reason .",
    "thus , this dip is independent of the properties of fluctuations and this is why both the power spectra and bispectra from @xmath88 and @xmath19 have a dip at the same redshift .",
    "note that we can also see the dip at @xmath89 in the 21 cm bispectrum at @xmath70 .",
    "it would be due to sample variance coming from calculation of ionized bubbles because evolutions of ionized bubbles are different among other realizations .",
    "on the other hand , the spin temperature fluctuations are negligible at low redshifts ( @xmath90 ) , because spin temperature is much higher than cmb temperature everywhere , that is , @xmath91 is very close to unity and independent of @xmath5 .",
    "however they substantially contribute at higher redshifts ( @xmath92 ) and have two peaks at @xmath93 and @xmath94 at large scales while the higher - redshift peak is much less noticeable at small scales .",
    "the dip at @xmath95 is induced by the onset of x - ray heating . at higher redshifts ( @xmath96 ) ,",
    "the spin temperature in dense region is lower than the average due to the wf effect , which couples the spin temperature to the kinetic temperature which is much lower than the cmb temperature . as a consequence , the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of spin temperature",
    "is negatively skewed at this epoch .",
    "contrastingly , at lower redshifts ( @xmath97 ) , x - ray heating becomes effective for our parameter set and the spin temperature in dense region rises rapidly so that the skewness of the pdf changes its sign .",
    "thus , at the onset of x - ray heating ( @xmath95 ) , the pdf becomes close to gaussian with relatively small width , that is , the the skewness vanishes and the variance has a local minimum .",
    "thus , in @xcite , it was suggested that the sign of skewness can be an indicator of the effectiveness of x - ray heating .",
    "the skewness and the variance have minima that coincide in redshift , similarly , it is natural that the dips in the bispectrum and the power spectrum are coincident with each other .    before eor ,",
    "the bispectrum , as well as the power spectrum , is mostly dominated by spin temperature fluctuations at large scales and will be a good probe of astrophysical effects such as the wf effect and x - ray heating .",
    "on the other hand , at small scales , the matter fluctuations are dominant and the bispectrum is of cosmological interest because it is induced by gravitational nonlinearity and , possibly , primordial non - gaussianity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "next , we focus on the shape dependence of the total bispectrum and its components . fixing @xmath98 , we plot contours of the bispectra in @xmath99-@xmath100 plain in top of fig . [",
    "fig : bispectrum_component_free ] . note that we do not use the normalised bispectrum , @xmath101 , but the unnormalized bispectrum , @xmath102 , here .",
    "we can see in what configuration of triangle the bispectra are strong . here",
    "it should be noted that the triangle condition is not satisfied in the blank region and that the contours are symmetric with respect to a line @xmath103 .    at @xmath104 when eor has proceeded to some extent(@xmath105 ) , the total bispectrum is strong at folded and squeezed types .",
    "the contribution from neutral hydrogen fraction fluctuations is dominant at these configurations , while matter fluctuation is dominant at equilateral type . at @xmath106",
    ", the dominant contribution comes from the spin temperature fluctuations and it is largest at squeezed type .",
    "the situation is similar at @xmath107 . at @xmath108 , both squeezed and folded type of the total bispectrum are strong .",
    "the contributions from matter and spin temperature fluctuations are comparable at these configurations , while the former is dominant at equilateral type .",
    "we also show the contour for @xmath109 in bottom of fig.[fig : bispectrum_component_free ] . compared with the case of @xmath110 ,",
    "contributions from both matter and spin temperature fluctuations are significant at @xmath108 . on the other hand , we find that the contribution from fluctuations of neutral hydrogen fraction at @xmath104 is clear compared with the case of @xmath110 .",
    "this helps us to subtract the information on neutral hydrogen and it is better to see larger scales if we would like to know the information on neutral hydrogen fluctuations .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the 21 cm bispectrum as a method to measure non - gaussianity of brightness temperature field .",
    "first , we have shown the scale - dependence of the 21 cm bispectrum for the  equilateral - shape \" at some redshifts .",
    "we found that the normalised 21 cm bispectrum seems not to have any characteristic scale in @xmath111 for each redshift .",
    "for @xmath112 , the normalised bispectrum is almost scale - invariant , while for @xmath51 it has a scale - dependence as @xmath113 .",
    "we have also shown the redshift evolution of the 21 cm bispectrum with fixed @xmath21 for three types of the shape in @xmath21-space .",
    "we found that the redshift evolution of the 21 cm bispectrum for the equilateral and folded shapes basically traces that of the 21 cm power spectrum , but in case with the squeezed shape , we could see a different behavior and it can be understood by considering the coupling between the large- and small - scale modes .",
    "then , we studied the 21 cm bispectra by decomposing it into the contributions from the matter density field , the fluctuations in the spin temperature and the neutral fraction . from the redshift evolution",
    ", we found the dominant component at each redshift and scale .",
    "we also show the shape dependence of each component and compared it with that of total 21 cm bispectrum .",
    "the shape dependence of each component looks similar to each other , but a slight difference also exists .",
    "hence , by future precise observation it is expected that we would obtain the information about the non - gaussian feature of these components separately .",
    "as far as the matter bispectrum is concerned , there have been a lot of works which discuss the shape - dependence by using the second order perturbation theory and also numerical n - body simulation .",
    "although most of the works focus on the matter bispectrum at the lower redshift ( @xmath114 ) or higher redshift ( @xmath115 in the dark age ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we can find that the shape of the matter bispectrum in our result is basically consistent with these previous works by extrapolation . by using the second order perturbation theory ,",
    "the matter bispectrum can be expressed as @xmath116 with @xmath117 being the matter power spectrum . for @xmath118 ,",
    "the matter power spectrum behaves as @xmath119 .",
    "based on this fact and the isosceles ansatz ( @xmath120 ) , we have @xmath121 , and hence the unnormalised matter bispectrum becomes larger as @xmath1 increases is the largest in the squeezed shape @xcite .    based on the above discussion about the matter bispectrum ,",
    "let us revisit the behavior of the 21 cm bispectrum as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bispectrum_abs ] .",
    "as we have mentioned , in contrast to other redshifts , for @xmath51 the normalised 21 cm bispectrum has a scale - dependence as @xmath122 in the equilateral shape . from fig .",
    "[ fig : bispectrum_component_equilateral ] , we find that at @xmath51 the matter contribution relatively dominates over the 21 cm bispectrum , and hence the behavior of the 21 cm bispectrum is expected to trace that of the matter bispectrum at this redshift .",
    "based on the expression obtained from the second order perturbation theory , the scale - dependence of the normalised matter bispectrum can be estimated as @xmath123 . hence , the behavior of the matter bispectrum could explain that of the 21 cm bispectrum at @xmath51 .",
    "note that the zeldovich approximation is used to solve density evolution in 21cmfast .",
    "this approximation is imperfect to calculate the bispectrum and it is desirable to use n - body simulations to estimate the bispectrum accurately .",
    "however , at scales less than @xmath124 at @xmath125 , density evolution with the zeldovich approximation coincides with that obtained by n - body simulations@xcite .    naively , the spatial distributions of the spin temperature and neutral fraction should be considered as tracers of matter density field , that is , they could be treated equally with those of the halos and galaxies .",
    "based on this consideration , the simplest way to express the spatial distributions of the spin temperature and neutral fraction is introducing a bias parameter , such as @xmath126 ( @xmath127 and @xmath9 ) . if such a bias parameter is scale - independent , the behaviors of the bispectra of the spin temperature and neutral fraction are completely the same as that of the matter density field .",
    "however , we can see slight differences between these components in fig .",
    "[ fig : bispectrum_component_free ] and also [ fig : bispectrum_abs ] .",
    "hence , we expect that the bias parameter should have non - trivial scale - dependence due to the non - linear or non - local transfer from the matter density field to the spin temperature and neutral fraction .",
    "we need to investigate this issue more deeply in future work .    here , we briefly discuss the cross correlation higher order terms in eq.([eq : bispectrum_component ] ) .",
    "although we only plot auto correlation term in fig.[fig : bispectrum_component_equilateral ] , neglected cross correlation and higher order terms are of the same order as the auto correlation terms .",
    "we show the ratio between the sum of three component terms and total 21 cm bispectrum as function of redshift in fig.[fig : fraction ] .",
    "as you can see from this figure , this ratio is not unity since we do not include the cross correlation and higher order terms , and hence , in practice , these terms can not be neglected .",
    "however , in our study , we focus on only auto correlation terms in order to study contribution from each component .",
    "although we expect that what cross correlation terms are effective at each epoch from fig.[fig : bispectrum_component_free ] ( e.g. cross correlation between fluctuations neutral hydrogen fraction and matter density might become effective at the eor ( @xmath128 ) ) , detailed study is our future work .",
    "the detectability of bispectrum is of critical interest . in our previous work @xcite , we estimated the signal - to - noise ratio of bispectrum , developing a formalism to calculate the bispectrum contributed from thermal noise .",
    "we find that the ska1 has enough sensitivity for both equilateral and isosceles(@xmath129 with k=0.06 @xmath130 ) triangles for @xmath131 at @xmath0=8 - 17 , while lofar will have sensitivity for the peaks of the bispectrum as a function of redshift .",
    "actually , galactic and extragalactic foreground will be a serious obstacle just as in the case of power spectrum and should be studied in detail .",

    "<S> redshifted 21 cm signal is a promising tool to investigate the state of intergalactic medium ( igm ) in the cosmic dawn ( cd ) and epoch of reionization(eor ) . in our previous work @xcite , we studied the variance and skewness of the 21 cm fluctuations to give a clear interpretation of the 21 cm power spectrum and found that skewness is a good indicator of the epoch when x - ray heating becomes effective . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the non - gaussian feature of the spatial distribution of the 21 cm signal is expected to be useful to investigate the astrophysical effects in the cd and eor . in this paper , in order to investigate such a non - gaussian feature in more detail , we focus on the bispectrum of the 21 cm signal . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that the 21 cm brightness temperature bispectrum is produced by non - gaussianity due to the various astrophysical effects such as the wouthysen - field ( wf ) effect , x - ray heating and reionization . </S>",
    "<S> we study the various properties of 21 cm bispectrum such as scale dependence , shape dependence and redshift evolution . </S>",
    "<S> and also we study the contribution from each component of 21 cm bispectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the contribution from each component has characteristic scale - dependent feature . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that the bulk of the 21 cm bispectrum at @xmath0  = 20 comes from the matter fluctuations , while in other epochs it is mainly determined by the spin and/or neutral fraction fluctuations and it is expected that we could obtain more detailed information on the igm in the cd and eor by using the 21 cm bispectrum in the future experiments , combined with the power spectrum and skewness .    </S>",
