    "the parameters , @xmath18 and @xmath25 , correspond to the higgs portal and gauge kinetic mixing @xcite , respectively .    the above model can be viewed as the @xmath26 limit of the gsw theory coupled to a ds , therefore we shall refer to the fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 as the `` visible sector '' ; and to @xmath6 and @xmath7 as the ds .",

    "the existence of negative eigenvalues depends on the depth of the attractive valley .",
    "the stabilizing effect of the scalar condensate comes from making this attractive potential valley shallower .",

    "therefore it may appear surprising that the change in the energy is rather small and positive although @xmath112 while @xmath25 changes considerably more than @xmath19 .",
    "this effect can be accounted for by observing that the energy is rather more sensitive to a change in @xmath19 than to one in @xmath25 , e.g.  at @xmath60 , @xmath113 , @xmath62 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the relative smallness of @xmath117 as compared to @xmath118 can be understood from eq .  .",
