    "ultracold atomic quantum gases in optical lattices have reached an unprecedented degree of control providing direct experimental access to a plethora of non - equilibrium phenomena @xcite .",
    "this control includes the modulation of the interparticle interactions via confinement - induced , magnetic and optical feshbach resonances @xcite , the design of arbitrarily shaped optical traps with variable lattice depths , and the ability to move time - periodically or even accelerate the entire lattice structure .",
    "this level of control and accuracy over the system parameters has opened the possibility to simulate and study quantum many - body phenomena in part inspired from condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "for instance , when accelerating an optical lattice , representative processes are bloch - oscillations @xcite , wannier - stark ladders @xcite , landau - zener tunneling @xcite and photon assisted tunneling @xcite , to name only a few .",
    "a promising technique is the lattice shaking which has been used in order to address e.g. , the coherent control of the superfluid to mott insulator phase transition @xcite , parametric amplification of matter waves @xcite , four - wave mixing @xcite , topological states of matter @xcite , hybridized band structure @xcite , and even the engineering of artificial gauge fields @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been shown @xcite that one can use lattice shaking to probe coherent band coupling and realize the formation of ferromagnetic domains . moreover , the dynamics induced by shaking an optical lattice can lead to an admixture of excited orbitals @xcite and constitutes an emergent branch of modern quantum physics .",
    "a substantial part of the previous studies has been primarily focussing on the renormalization of the physics due to driving , the mean - field approach @xcite for weak interactions , where the gross - pitaevskii equation is still valid , and a linear response treatment @xcite .",
    "however , a relatively large modulation of the strength or of the frequency of the driving as well as strong interactions , calls for alternative methods which can take into account higher - orbitals .",
    "indeed , the inclusion of higher - band contributions introduces new degrees of freedom and as a result additional physical processes come into play .",
    "hereby , a sinusoidal shaking of the optical lattice is a natural starting point which induces an in - phase dipole mode on each site .",
    "an interesting and so far largely unexplored direction is the study of the interplay between higher bands for the intra - well mode and the inter - well tunneling dynamics with respect to the driving frequency , and the investigation of the effect of the interatomic interactions in the overall process . in this way , it is natural to start with the investigation of the few body analogue in order to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the microscopic properties of the strongly driven interacting system .",
    "although the major part of the presented results is devoted to the case of four bosons in a triple - well setup , we provide strong evidence that our findings are still applicable for larger lattice systems and larger particle numbers .",
    "motivated by the recent experimental progress @xcite we investigate in the present work the effects a periodically driven one - dimensional optical lattice can introduce in a small ensemble of ultracold bosons .",
    "the dynamical response of the system for a wide range of driving frequencies is studied by means of the concept of fidelity or autocorrelation function .",
    "even though we consider a scenario with a deep lattice such that the tunneling modes have a minor influence on the overall dynamics , a quite rich excitation spectrum is found .",
    "we note that such intra - band excitations , which lead to a coupling between the two lowest energy bands , have been exploited in order to realise single- and two - qubit gates , where the quantum bit has been encoded in the localised wannier functions of the two lowest energy bands of each lattice site @xcite . in order to analyze the intra - well dynamics we employ the one - body reduced density matrix .",
    "the fourier spectrum of the local one - body density as well as of the on - site density oscillations are employed in order to obtain insights into the excited intra - well modes .",
    "we find a resonant behaviour of the dipole mode indicating that the intra - well dynamics can be controlled by adjusting the driving frequency .",
    "moreover , the magnification of the intra - well generated mode at resonance is also manifested in the population of additional lattice momenta .",
    "our investigation of the resonances is supported by a floquet analysis for the effective single - particle degree of freedom .",
    "this allows us to further explore the on - site dynamics and the inter - well tunneling that occur due to the driving .",
    "including interatomic interactions for larger atom numbers we analyze similarities and differences with respect to the single - particle description .",
    "the above outlined findings are confirmed for different filling factors , lattice potentials , and boundary conditions . to solve the underlying many - body schrdinger equation",
    "we apply the @xmath0 multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree method for bosons ( mctdhb ) @xcite which is especially designed to treat the driven out - of - equilibrium quantum dynamics of interacting bosons .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we introduce our setup and the multi - band expansion . sec .",
    "iii contains the driven quantum dynamics first from a single - particle perspective , by performing a floquet analysis , and second by inspecting the dynamics of a small bosonic ensemble including repulsive interactions .",
    "we summarize our findings and provide an outlook in sec.v .",
    "appendix a briefly outlines our computational method .",
    "this section is devoted to a brief presentation of the theoretical framework of our study .",
    "in particular , we shall briefly discuss the driven optical lattice , the underlying many - body hamiltonian , and the concept of multi - band expansion .",
    "the latter will be a useful tool in order to understand the excitations involved in the dynamics .",
    "the periodic driving of an optical lattice can be accomplished in two different ways . retroreflecting mirrors that are used to form the lattice can be moved periodically in space or , alternatively , a frequency difference between counterpropagating laser beams can be induced by means of acousto - optical modulators @xcite which renders the lattice time - dependent . here",
    ", we model the driven optical lattice with a sinusoidal function of the form @xmath1.\\ ] ] such a potential has been implemented in the experiment of e.g. ref .",

    "is the wave vector of the laser beams which form the optical lattice , while its depth @xmath2 can be tuned by adjusting the lasers intensity .",

    "@xmath16 is the transverse harmonic oscillator length with @xmath17 the frequency of the two - dimensional confinement , while @xmath18 denotes the free space 3d s - wave scattering length . in this way",
    ", the interaction strength can be tuned either via @xmath18 with the aid of feshbach resonances @xcite , or via the transversal confinement frequency @xmath19 @xcite .    for the sake of simplicity and computational convenience , we rescale the hamiltonian ( 2 ) in units of the recoil energy @xmath20 .",
    "then , the corresponding length , time and frequency scales are given in units of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively . in our simulations",
    "we have used a sufficiently large lattice depth with values ranging from @xmath24 @xmath25 to @xmath26 @xmath25 such that each well includes three localized single - particle wannier states . in particular , due to the deep optical lattice and small driving amplitudes ( in comparison to the lattice constant ) mainly used in our simulations highly energetic excitations above the barrier are excluded and as a consequence heating processes can be minimized .",
    "the confinement of the bosons in the @xmath10-well system is imposed by the use of hard - wall boundary conditions at positions @xmath27 , where the potential is maximum .",
    "in addition , we set also @xmath28 and the coupling strength becomes @xmath29 , while @xmath5 represents the dimensionless driving amplitude .",
    "the rescaled shaken triple well is given by @xmath30 with the hard wall boundaries located at @xmath31 .",
    "the understanding of the spatial localization of states in lattice systems makes the use of multi - band wannier number states crucial as it includes the information of excited bands and allows to interpret both intraband and interband processes . in general",
    ", this representation is valid when the lattice potential is deep enough such that the wannier states between different wells have a very small overlap for not too high energetic excitation . in the present case where",
    "the potential is periodically driven the above description can still be used as long as the driving amplitude is small enough in comparison to the lattice constant @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath32 . in this way , each localized wannier function can be still adapted and assigned to a certain well and the respective band - mixing is fairly small . for large displacements",
    "one should use a time - dependent wannier basis in order to ensure that the corresponding on - site wannier states are well - adapted to each well during the driving .    to introduce the formalism ,",
    "let us consider a system consisting of @xmath8 bosons , @xmath10-wells and @xmath33 localized single particle bands @xcite .",
    "then , the expansion of the many - body bosonic wavefunction in terms of the number states of non - interacting bosons reads @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the multiband wannier number state and the element @xmath36 denotes the number of bosons being localized in the @xmath37-th well satisfying the constraint @xmath38 .",

    "then , it must hold @xmath50 for every @xmath51 , while @xmath52 and @xmath53 for every @xmath54 .",
    "let us consider an example of a system with four bosons ( @xmath55 ) confined in a triple well ( @xmath56 ) which includes three bands ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "then , for instance , the state @xmath58 with @xmath59 , and @xmath60=@xmath61=(0,1,0 ) , @xmath62=(0,1,1 ) denotes a state for which in the left ( right ) well one boson occupies the first excited band , whereas in the middle well one boson is localized in the first excited and one in the second excited band . as a final attempt , here",
    ", we make a link between the ground state and its dominant spatial configuration in terms of the aforementioned multiband expansion .",
    "to do that , let us choose again a system consisting of four bosons in a triple well as it will extensively be used in the following .",
    "it is known that , in general , the ground state configuration depends on the interaction strength , while for the present system , i.e. @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the on - site interaction effects will always be prominent .",
    "for the non - interacting case ( @xmath63 ) the dominant spatial configuration of the system is @xmath58 , with @xmath64 and @xmath65 due to the hard - wall boundaries which render the middle and outer sites non - equivalent . in the course of increasing interaction a tendency towards a uniform population of each site , e.g. for @xmath66 , due to the repulsion of the bosons is observed . in this region",
    "the system is described by a superposition of lowest - band states which are predominantly of single - pair occupancy , e.g. @xmath58 , @xmath67 , and double - pair occupancy , e.g. @xmath68 . for further increasing repulsion , e.g. @xmath69 , a trend towards the repopulation of the central well is noted .",
    "as we enter the strong interaction regime , e.g. @xmath70 , the state consists of a particle in the first excited - band being on a commensurate background of localized particles which lie in the zeroth band and the dominant ground state configuration is @xmath58 , with @xmath64 and @xmath71 .",
    "finally , for strong interparticle repulsion , e.g. @xmath72 , the contribution from the higher - band states becomes more prominent and the corresponding ground state configuration is characterized by an admixture of zeroth- and excited - band states .     as a function of the driving frequency @xmath73 ( measured in units of @xmath23 ) .",

    "subsequently , a floquet analysis is employed in order to investigate the underlying single - particle physics . finally , we focus on specific interaction effects .",
    "let us explore the dynamical response or sensitivity of the system with respect to the driving frequency @xmath73 .",
    "in order to investigate the stability of the system against the perturbations induced by the shaking [ see eq.(1 ) ] , we first analyse the fidelity @xcite between the initial state and the state evolved at time @xmath83 : @xmath84 , where the dependence on @xmath85 is implicit in the time evolved state @xmath86 . here",
    "we will consider a system of four bosons in a triple - well with @xmath81 , whose ground state ( i.e. , the initial state @xmath87 ) corresponds to a superfluid state , as the filling factor is not commensurable and we do not encounter the formation of a mott insulating state . in terms of its dominant spatial configuration our system initially consists ( see also sec.ii.c ) of two bosons in the middle well and two others each of them localized in one of the outer wells , i.e. the state @xmath58 , with @xmath64 and @xmath65 has the most prominent contribution . figure 1(a ) shows @xmath88 as a function of the driving frequency @xmath73 .",
    "the dynamics is characterized by three main regions with respect to @xmath73 , where the system is driven far from the initial state , while for the remaining frequency regions ( red sections in fig .",

    "the emergence of these dynamical regions strongly depends on the parameters of the optical lattice .",
    "for instance , for smaller lattice depths the aforementioned regions will be wider , because of the smaller potential energy , which favors a possible deviation of the system from the initial state .",

    "1(a ) ] the dependence of the energy on the driving frequency is weak and it is essentially constant during the time evolution . on the other hand , for the regions where @xmath99 , @xmath96 increases initially and it shows an oscillatory behaviour . in particular",
    ", for @xmath76 the total energy exhibits an oscillatory ( almost periodic ) pattern which can also be observed in the corresponding fidelity evolution .",
    "this driving frequency will be referred to in the following as critical and denoted by @xmath100 , that is , the driving frequency for which @xmath101}f_{\\omega_d}(t)$ ] is minimal .",
    "indeed , as we shall see below , the most interesting dynamics of the system takes place close to this frequency .",
    "finally , let us inspect the response of the system to the driving from a one - body perspective via the single - particle density @xmath102 .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the evolution of the one - body density for different driving frequencies @xmath73 , but with the same amplitude @xmath5 .",

    "2(b ) ] we observe the periodic formation of enhanced density oscillations being accompanied by a broadening of each intra - well ensemble .",
    "the peculiar behaviour of the bosonic ensemble observed for @xmath104 is characterized by three processes and time scales : @xmath37 ) the internal fast oscillations of the density ; @xmath105 ) the large amplitude oscillations of the density in each well of period @xmath106 ; @xmath107 ) the tunneling between the wells with a period of about @xmath108 .",

    "( 5 ) for @xmath10 times and by virtue of eq . ( 4 ) , we readily obtain the stroboscopic time evolution of @xmath129 as @xmath134 numerically , we obtain the fms for a given initial time @xmath135 by calculating the eigenvectors of the one period evolution operator @xmath133 [ see eq .",
    "we refer the interested reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed description of the employed computational scheme .    finally , let us note that eq .",
    "( 6 ) already reveals some interesting features of the time evolution in periodically driven systems as we shall see in the following .",
    "imaging that only a single fm , say @xmath136 , is populated .",
    "the stroboscopic evolution of the probability density is thus given as @xmath137 .",
    "hence , @xmath138 is again periodic with period @xmath139 and the only time dependence arises from the explicit time dependence of the fm , which is commonly referred to as  micro - motion  .",
    "this situation changes if the initial state populates multiple fms . in this case",
    "one encounters interference terms in @xmath140 between the different fms in the form of @xmath141 .",

    "( 6 ) . as a result",
    ", we find that we can reproduce some of the main features of the on - site dynamics shown in figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) , namely , we observe resonantly enhanced on - site oscillations in an interval of the driving frequencies around @xmath154 .",
    "following the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , further insight into this effect can be obtained by studying the population of the fms by the initial state as a function of @xmath85 .",
    "we therefore sort the fms @xmath155 according to their overlap with the initial state and label the mode with the largest overlap as @xmath156 , the mode with the second largest overlap as @xmath157 etc . in fig .",
    "3(a ) the coefficients of the two most populated fms , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , are shown as a function of the driving frequency .",
    "apparently , both at small frequencies ( @xmath158 ) and at large ones ( @xmath159 ) only a single fm is notably populated , while @xmath109 and @xmath110 become comparable at distinct driving frequencies ( e.g. , at @xmath160 ) . according to our discussion above , in cases when @xmath109 is close to one , and thus only a single fm is populated , the stroboscopic time evolution , as given by eq .",
    "( 6 ) , becomes , to a good approximation , time periodic with the period of the driving @xmath139 .",
    "note that this agrees with the observation of fig .",
    "2(a ) , that away from the resonance frequencies , the single particle density merely performs oscillations whose period matches @xmath139 .",
    "this corresponds precisely to the previously described micro - motion arising from the explicit time dependence of the fm @xmath161 .    on resonance , when @xmath162 , the evolution of @xmath163 includes , besides the micro - motion , an interference term between @xmath164 and @xmath165 , whose period is dictated by the corresponding quasi energies and is given by : @xmath166 .",
    "indeed , we find that this term is responsible for the observed on - site mode with a period of @xmath106 lattice oscillations [ compare fig .",
    "2(b ) ] . up to now , however , it is not yet clear why @xmath165 is resonantly populated at certain frequencies . in order to provide an answer to this question",
    "we follow the argumentation in ref .",
    "@xcite and consider the dependence of the quasi energy spectrum on the driving frequency @xmath85 as shown in fig .",
    "highlighted are the two most populated modes at each @xmath85 ( blue and red dots ) revealing avoided crossings of these two modes at the frequencies where a resonant enhancement of @xmath167 was observed in fig .",
    "hence , at these values of @xmath85 the fms @xmath164 and @xmath165 are resonantly coupled by the driving which results in an increase of @xmath167 and ultimately to the in sec .",
    "iii.a described on - site dynamics .    in the following we",
    "provide insight into the question why we observe floquet resonances at driving frequencies around @xmath168 .",
    "let us start by noting that , by means of appropriate unitary transformations , the single particle hamiltonian with a potential as given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be recasted into the form : @xmath169 where the amplitude of the oscillating term is given by @xmath170 .",
    "that is the transformed hamiltonian takes the form of a static lattice plus a time - dependent perturbation whose strength is determinded by @xmath171 . for the used parameters of @xmath172 and @xmath80 and for the range of considered frequencies of @xmath173",
    "we get that the amplitude @xmath171 of the time - dependent term is of order one .",
    "hence , it can be seen as a small perturbation compared to the static term of strength @xmath174 and we can expect that the qes of the driven lattice setup can be estimated by the actual energies of the undriven lattice .",
    "resonances would than be expected whenever the energy difference between two notably populated eigenstates of the static system matches an integer multiple of @xmath175 .",
    "in fact we find that the energies of the three energetically lowest states of even parity are given by @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "naivly , we expect driving induced resonances whenever the ground state is resonantly coupled to one of the excited states .",
    "indeed we find @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "thus , following this line of arguments , at driving frequencies of approximately @xmath181 the ground state of the unperturbed lattice is coupled via a 2 ( 3 ) photon process to the first ( second ) excited states .",
    "in order to justify this simplyfied picture we show the energies @xmath182 and @xmath183 on top of the qe spectrum of the driven lattice ( see fig .",
    "away from any resonances , both energies are almost identical to the qes of the corresponding floquet states , so e.g. the red line is practically on top of an underlying black line .",
    "closer to the resonance region , we see of course deviations of the qes from the mere energies of the undriven lattice as the different states are coupled by the driving .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "3(c ) provides an overview over the possibly observed frequencies in the on - site dynamics at various driving frequencies . shown",

    "3(b ) ] results in a much faster on - site oscillation .      besides the on - site dynamics , fig .",
    "2(b ) revealed a pronounced tunneling between the lattice sites at certain driving frequencies .",
    "similar to the previous section , we analyze this effect in the following by applying floquet theory for the single particle dynamics .",
    "we choose the same setup as before , that is , @xmath190 , with the same initial state , i.e. essentially a gaussian centered around the potential well at @xmath191 , but with the difference that the periodic boundary conditions are imposed at @xmath192 ( instead of at @xmath151 as we did before ) . in this way we allow for tunneling of the wave packet into the two neighbouring lattice sites .",
    "as for the on - site dynamics , we provide an overview over the observable frequencies in the temporal evolution in fig .",
    "3(d ) [ in close analogy to fig .",
    "3(c ) ] . note that , since the tunneling dynamics observed in sec .",
    "iii.a occurs on much longer timescales as compared to the on - site dynamics , we only show the extract of the regime of small frequencies , i.e. @xmath112 .",
    "furthermore , because no on - site dynamics occurs with timescales matching the extremely small frequencies of @xmath193 , all the frequencies depicted in fig .",
    "3(d ) are indeed associated with an inter - well tunneling mode . in accordance with the observation made in the many - particle simulations [ cf .",
    "2(b ) ] we observe a strong increase of the frequencies associated with the tunneling dynamics in the range of driving frequencies of @xmath194 . away from this resonance , for example at @xmath195 , the only notable tunneling mode corresponds to an interference term of two fms which oscillates with a period of @xmath196 and could therefore not be observed in the simulations performed in sec .",
    "iii.a . within the regime of resonant",
    "driving , e.g. at @xmath181 , the frequency of the tunneling mode is increased strongly and the associated oscillation period becomes @xmath197 matching the observed tunneling mode in the weakly interacting regime [ cf .",
    "2(b ) ] .      in the previous section",
    "we have shown that most of the features of the ( effective ) single - particle dynamics of fig .",
    "2 can be explained via a non - interacting floquet theory . as we shall see now , however , the full dynamics presents a rich excitation spectrum ascribable to the particles interaction , especially in the strong interaction regime .",
    "thus , we investigate the tunneling and excitation probabilities of the dominant particle configurations , for different driving frequencies @xmath73 , by means of the multiband expansion introduced in sec .  ii.c .",
    "more precisely , we compute and analyze the probabilities , during the dynamics , defined as @xmath198 the case @xmath199 @xmath200 @xmath201 refers to the lowest - band inter - well tunneling dynamics .",
    "the initial state of the system corresponds to the ground state of four weakly interacting bosons with @xmath81 in a triple well , while the dominant number state configuration ( see also sec.ii.c ) is @xmath58 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in this way",
    ", a lowest - band tunneling process can take place among the initial state and : a ) another state of single - pair occupancy , e.g. @xmath67 ( @xmath113 and @xmath202 ) , b ) a state with double - pair occupancy , e.g. @xmath68 ( @xmath203 and @xmath204 ) , c ) a state with triple occupancy , e.g. @xmath205 ( @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath204 ) or d ) a state with quartic occupancy , e.g. @xmath208 ( @xmath209 and @xmath210 ) .",
    "however , the from the system prefered tunneling processes form a hierarchy according to the energetical difference between the initial and final state . for instance , a tunneling process to another state of single - pair occupancy will be more preferable than to a state of double - pair occupancy etc .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows the tunneling probability to the energetically closest number state , which is @xmath67 ( or @xmath211 ) with @xmath113 and @xmath202 ( or @xmath212 and @xmath213 ) , i.e. @xmath214 with @xmath113 and @xmath202 , for various driving frequencies .",
    "as it is shown , for @xmath215 this tunneling mode has a small amplitude and it is quite insensitive to @xmath73 as intuitively expected from the fact that the evolved - state is essentially unperturbed by the driving ( see also fig .",
    "1(a ) ) . for @xmath216 , however , the amplitude of the oscillations is significantly larger indicating an enhancement of the tunneling ( see also figs .",

    "4(a ) ) the oscillations occur with a larger period .",
    "the fact that it oscillates with a larger time period can be traced back to the behaviour of the fidelity at @xmath218 .",
    "indeed , for short times ( @xmath78 ) the system stays in the initial ground state and after some time the fidelity starts to decrease , differently from the situation at @xmath76 , where the system deviates from the initial state on much shorter time scales . concerning the remaining tunneling modes , i.e. tunneling to higher energetical states that belong to the lowest - band ( see discussion above ) , they are negligible as they provide a very small contribution even for @xmath104 .",

    "we note that a small contribution comes from the state @xmath235 with @xmath233 and @xmath236 .",

    "7(b ) we show how the minimal population of the zeroth - band ( @xmath101}p_{0}$ ] ) varies as a function of the lattice depth . for an increasing lattice depth",

    "indeed , in order to investigate whether there is such a dependence various interaction strengths ( for the same particle number @xmath55 ) , e.g. @xmath81 , @xmath273 and @xmath274 , have been considered ( omitted here for brevity ) and it was found that the position of the resonance is essentially unaffected .    in the following ,",
    "let us inspect the momentum distribution with varying driving frequency with the aim of understanding whether signatures of a parametric amplification of matter - waves can be observed .",

    "the population of the @xmath281 , @xmath282 modes at @xmath283 is reminiscent of the parametric amplification of matter - wave phenomenon , as observed experimentally in ref .",

    "8(d ) shows the momentum distribution at resonance , but for a strong interparticle repulsion @xmath122 .",
    "the expected periodic pattern for large evolution times is blurred as an effect of the strong interaction which decreases the degree of coherence .    finally , in order to demonstrate that our findings are of general character we investigate a larger lattice system with a filling factor smaller than unity .",
    "specifically , the case of five bosons in a twelve - well finite lattice has been considered . concerning the ground state with filling factor @xmath284",
    ", the most important aspect is the spatial redistribution of the atoms as the interaction strength increases . indeed , as the repulsion increases from the non - interacting to the weak interaction regime the atoms are pushed from the central to the outer sites which gain and lose population in the course of increasing @xmath219 .    in the following",

    "the above mentioned observations suggest a generalization of the observed phenomena to larger systems as well .",
    "indeed , the same shaken scheme has been tested in different systems ( omitted here for brevity ) , e.g. 10 bosons in a triple - well , 6 bosons in five wells etc , confirming that the above observed resonant - like behaviour of the bosonic ensemble occurs in each setup .",
    "the correlated non - equilibrium quantum dynamics of few - body bosonic ensembles induced by the driving of a finite - size optical lattice has been investigated .",
    "our work focuses particularly on the regimes of large lattice depths and small driving amplitudes .",
    "this choice has been made in order to limit the degree of excitations that would otherwise lead to heating processes .",
    "starting from the ground state of a weak or strongly interacting small ensemble , we have examined in detail the time evolution of the system induced by periodically driving the optical lattice .",
    "we find that the dynamical evolution of the system is governed by two main modes : the inter - well tunneling and the intra - well dipole - like mode .",
    "the dynamical behaviour of the system in the non - interacting regime has been firstly analyzed via floquet theory , that is , at the single - particle level , providing an accurate interpretation of the observed processes . for large particle numbers and large interaction strengths , however ,",

    "the inter - well tunneling mode is weak as a consequence of the deep optical lattice and the small driving amplitude . on the other hand ,",
    "the local dipole mode has been identified from the intra - well oscillations of bosons in the individual wells .",
    "remarkably enough , it has been found that by tuning the driving frequency the intra - well dynamics experiences a resonant - like behaviour .",
    "this is manifested e.g. by the enhanced oscillations in the one - body density evolution or from the periodic population of additional lattice momenta in the momentum distribution of the one - body density . additionally , on a single - particle level in terms of floquet theory",
    ", it has been shown that in the proximity of the resonance the first two fms possess the main contribution , while away from resonance the dynamics can be described with the inclusion of the first fm . to explain the enhanced population of the second fm at resonance",
    "the corresponding quasienergy spectrum has been employed , revealing avoided - crossings between the first two fms at certain driving frequencies . to obtain the frequencies which refer to the on - site and tunneling dynamics",
    ", the corresponding frequencies associated with the interference terms between the fms have been employed showing pronounced on - site oscillations and an enhancement of the inter - well tunneling mode in the vicinity of the resonance .",
    "considering an ensemble of few - bosons we examined the influence of the interatomic interactions both for the inter- and intra - well generated modes .",
    "indeed , it has been found that the repulsion affects each of the aforementioned modes , yielding a destruction of the inter - well tunneling for strong interactions and an enhancement of the excitations ( i.e. the contribution of higher - band states ) .",
    "moreover , in the spectrum of the local one - body density with respect to the driving frequency all the relative dynamical frequencies , e.g. on - site oscillations and tunneling period have been identified .",
    "finally , the occurrence of the above resonance seems to be universal in a periodically driven lattice as it is independent of the filling factor , the boundary conditions or the interparticle repulsion .",
    "we would like to underline that , contrarily to related studies based e.g. on effective model hamiltonians or lattice calculations with tensor network methods , our many - body analysis based on the ab initio mctdhb method has the advantage to provide the complete system wavefunction in space and time .",
    "thus , it enables us to accurately identify the involved intra- and inter - well band excitations .",
    "let us comment on possible future investigations .",
    "although in the present work we did not employ the multi - layer structure of the ml - mctdhb method , our ab - initio approach is well suited to describe the dynamics of multi bosonic species . given this , a first natural extension would be to study the driven dynamics of mixtures consisting of different bosonic species in order to unravel the induced excitation modes or to device schemes for selective transport of an individual bosonic component . in relation to the present study , it would be interesting to simulate the parametrical amplification of matter - waves with interesting applications , like the generation of four - wave mixing , entanglement production , but also for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics with massive particles like the hong - ou - mandel experiment , as recently performed with a bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",

    "<S> the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of finite ultracold bosonic ensembles in periodically driven one - dimensional optical lattices is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> our study reveals that the driving enforces the bosons in different wells to oscillate in - phase and to exhibit a dipole - like mode . </S>",
    "<S> a wide range from weak - to - strong driving frequencies is covered and a resonance - like behaviour of the intra - well dynamics is discussed . in the proximity of the resonance </S>",
    "<S> a rich intraband excitation spectrum is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the single particle excitation mechanisms are studied in the framework of floquet theory elucidating the role of the driving frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of the interatomic repulsive interactions is examined in detail yielding a strong influence on the tunneling period and the excitation probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the dependence of the resonance upon a variation of the tunable parameters of the optical lattice is examined . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on the ab - initio multi - configuration time - dependent hartree method for bosons . </S>",
