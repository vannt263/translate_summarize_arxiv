    "during the last two decades different types of quantum computer and its physical implementations have been considered @xcite , where single natural or artificial atoms , ions , molecules etc . , are used for encoding of the qubits .",
    "physical implementation of the quantum computing on many qubits remains a main challenge in the first turn because of decoherence problems causing intensive search for the novel experimental approaches .",
    "the promising approach is that using natural atoms ( ions , molecules ,  ) with long coherence time .",
    "recently , a new physical realization of a quantum computer has been proposed which uses multi - atomic coherent ( mac ) ensembles for encoding of single qubits @xcite .",
    "mac ensembles provide a huge enhancement of the effective dipole moment that leads to a considerable acceleration of the quantum processing rate .",
    "however , excess excited quantum states in the mac- ensemble should be blocked in order to realize an effective two - level system providing thereby perfect encoding of the qubits .",
    "a dipole - dipole interaction is intensively discussed for the blockade of the excess quantum states @xcite .",
    "however , the dipole blockade mechanism introduces the decoherence due to a strong dependence of the dipole - dipole interaction on a spatial distance between the interacting atoms .",
    "recently , another blockade mechanism based on using a light - shift imbalance in a raman transition has been proposed @xcite though its implementation is complicated because of additional quantum transitions arising with this imbalance .",
    "we have also proposed a novel decoherence free blockade mechanism @xcite based on the collective interactions of the atoms in the qed cavity .",
    "rapid development of physics and technology of the microcavities @xcite makes this blockade mechanism a quite promising though not very simple for experimental realization .    by developing this approach ,",
    "we demonstrate in this paper how logical single and two - qubit gates can be realized naturally in the quantum computer based on the mac- ensembles in the qed cavity using multi - qubit encoding intensively discussed in @xcite . here",
    ", we explicitly show an encoded universality for some set of these gates by using the 2-qubit encoding .",
    "this encoding allows solving two major problems of solid - state quantum computing .",
    "first of all , it eliminates the problems with implementation of single - qubit operations .",
    "additionally , the encoding forms a decoherence - free subspace ( dfs ) , which allows preventing a number of computational errors .",
    "moreover , this approach opens the ability of performing the controlled - not operation in a single step .",
    "this operation is achieved by using an additional nonlinear frequency shift of the atomic transitions due to heisenberg - type atom - atom interactions arising in the qed cavity .",
    "finally we show that the proposed implementation of the quantum gates set can be applied for the construction of quantum computer satisfying divincenzo criteria @xcite .",
    "we consider the realization of swapping gates controlled by a photon qubit .",
    "we can launch signal photon qubits ( denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the qed cavity and take out the qubits in the free space through a semitransparent mirror fig .",

    "first , signal photon is transferred to one of the processor nodes from the quantum memory or another logical qubit and the atomic frequency in the processor nodes is tuned out of the cavity- mode frequency . with that , mirrors are chosen to be dumb at new frequency of processing nodes .",
    "the control photon is released from the node with control qubit and is introduced into microcavity with the processing node via the interaction with one mac ensemble of logical qubit . here ,",
    "initially the control photon transfers to the mac ensemble due to the resonant interaction with additional atomic resonant transitions when the frequency of control qubit node being detuned from the resonant interaction",
    ". then the control photon is released from the mac ensemble at frequency of the microcavity mode after tuning the frequency of additional atomic transition to that of the microcavity .",
    "afterwards , the frequency of the additional atomic transition is detuned from the frequency of the microcavity mode when control photon is already released .",
    "the released control photon can not be absorbed by mac ensemble or escape from the microcavity .",

    "summarizing , we have proposed an approach for constructing encoded universal quantum computations on the multi - atomic coherent ensembles based on swapping operations in qed cavity .",
    "the main ideas of the proposed quantum computing scheme are encoding of logical qubits by two physical qubits and using microcavities for implementing controlled - iswap operations .",
    "scalability is provided by using of multi - qubit quantum memory situated in one of the multi - atomic node .",
    "it allows to implement explicitly any encoded single - qubit gate by 3 elementary operations and to perform encoded controlled - not gate by a single controlled - swap operation on pairs of atomic ensembles .",
    "the physical implementation of the basic gates is sufficiently robust and provides fast single qubit operations based on multi - atomic ensembles .",
    "detailed analysis of these issues requires further investigation of physical limitations determined by the experimental parameters of real physical systems .",
    "the proposed approach considerably simplifies physical implementation of a quantum computer on multi - atomic ensembles in the qed cavity at the price of doubling the number of qubits for computation .",
    "besides , it permits to avoid the necessity of implementing blockade of excess states in the multi - atomic ensembles .",
    "note also , that using of two atomic ensembles for encoding of a single qubit state will be convenient for the quantum computer interface with the external quantum information carried by using photon polarization qubits since the two polarization components of the photon qubit can be coupled directly with the relevant pair of the atomic ensemble state .",
