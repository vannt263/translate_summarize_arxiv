    "it is commonly assumed that supernovae of type ia ( sn ia ) are the results of thermonuclear runaways ( tnr ) in the cores of carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarfs ( wd ) which are members of interacting binary systems , and have accreted material from a companion until their masses reach the chandrasekhar limit ( cl ) and a carbon detonation / deflagration occurs ( nomoto , thielemann , & yokoi 1984 ; leibundgut 2000 , 2001 ; hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 ) . the binary star systems that evolve to this explosion , however , have not been identified . given the importance of sn ia , both to our understanding of the evolution of the universe and to the formation of iron peak elements in the galaxy , we must identify the progenitors of these explosions .",
    "the binary scenario was originally proposed by whelan and iben ( 1973 ) , and as a result virtually every type of close binary that contains a wd has been suggested at one time or another .",
    "however , based purely on _ observations _ , most of the systems that have been proposed can not be the progenitors since the defining characteristic of a sn ia outburst is the absence of hydrogen or helium in the spectrum ( filippenko 1997 ) .",
    "( we note , however , that sn 2002ic , a sn ia , did show a _ shell _ of hydrogen in its spectrum [ hamuy et al .",
    "one of the first suggestions was a classical nova system ( cn ) , but the amount of core material ejected during the nova outburst implies strongly that the wd is decreasing in mass as a result of the outburst ( macdonald 1984 ; gehrz et al .",
    "1998 ; starrfield 2003 ) .",
    "other suggestions such as symbiotic novae ( t crb or rs oph , for example ) can probably be ruled out because the supernova explosion would take place inside the outer layers of a red giant and hydrogen would be present in the spectrum ( marietta , burrows , & fryxell 2000 ; lentz et al .",
    "2002 )    an important development was the discovery of the super soft x - ray binary sources ( sss : trmper et al .",
    "1991 ) and the suggestions that they were sn ia progenitors ( van den heuvel et al . 1992 [ vdh92 ] ; branch et al . 1995 ; kahabka & van den heuvel 1997 [ kvdh97 ] ) .",
    "they are luminous , l@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 , with effective temperatures ranging from 30 to 50 ev or higher ( @xmath4k ) .",
    "vdh92 proposed that their properties could be explained by nuclear burning occurring in the outer layers of a wd at the same rate at which it was being accreted ( steady burning hypothesis : paczynski and zytkow [ 1978 ) ] , sion , acierno , & tomczyk [ 1979 ] ; iben [ 1982 ] , and fujimoto [ 1982a , b ] ) .",
    "therefore , the mass of the wd was increasing , it could reach the cl , and then explode as a sn ia ( vdh92 ) . nevertheless , except for the pioneering work of sion et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , no stellar evolution calculations have been done for massive wds accreting at the high mass accretion rates required to test the steady burning hypothesis .",
    "calculations were done for lower mass co wds by iben ( 1982 ) and sion and starrfield ( 1994 ) but the luminosities and effective temperatures of their simulations were too low to agree with the observations of sss such as cal 83 or cal 87 ( greiner 2000 ) , and it was not clear that the wds that they studied would reach the cl .",
    "in contrast , we find in the calculations reported here that the material can burn at mass accretion rates that are far lower than the steady burning rate ( a few @xmath5m@xmath1yr@xmath3 : kahabka 2002 ) .",
    "a hydrogen tnr does not occur because the wd is sufficiently hot that hydrogen burns in the layers near the surface as it is accreted .",
    "we , therefore , refer to our results as surface hydrogen burning ( shb ) to prevent any confusion with steady burning . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe the sss . in the following sections , we describe our evolutionary sequences and end with a summary .",
    "the rosat all sky survey ( and later pointed observations ) established the sss as a class of x - ray emitting systems ( trmper et al . 1991 ) .",
    "a recent catalog can be found in greiner ( 2000 ) , and a discussion of their binary properties can be found in cowley et al .",
    "two systems have orbital periods of 1.04 d ( cal 83 ) and 10.6 h ( cal 87 ) which are longer than those of typical cne .",
    "unfortunately , there is a large range in the luminosities and effective temperatures reported for a given system ( greiner 2000 ) .",
    "part of the difficulty is that , for the systems studied by rosat , only a small region of the emitted spectrum is visible in the detectors and large corrections have to be applied to the observations ( kvdh97 ) .",
    "the tabulated luminosities and effective temperatures of the two best studied sources are : ( 1 ) cal 83 : l = @xmath6erg s@xmath3 and t@xmath7 = @xmath8k ( parmar et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the analyses of xmm reflection grating spectrometers spectra of cal 83 imply a temperature @xmath9k ( paerels et al .",
    "( 2 ) cal 87 : l = @xmath10erg s@xmath3 and t@xmath7 = @xmath11k ( parmar et al .",
    "the wd masses are , as yet , undetermined but the temperatures and luminosities imply wd radii . observed properties for a number of sss ( values taken from the above references or greiner 2000 ) are shown in a theoretical hr diagram ( figure 1 ) along with the results of our calculations ( described below ) .",
    "the systems shown in this figure are cal 83 , cal 87 , rx j0019.8 + 2156 ( rxj0019 ) , rx j0925.7 - 4758 ( rxj0925 ) , 1e 0035.4 - 7230 ( 1e0035 ) , and rx j0439.8 - 6809 ( rxj0439 ) .",
    "rxj0019 and rxj0925 are in our galaxy , cal 83 , cal 87 , and rxj0439 are in the lmc , and 1e0035 is in the smc .",
    "while cal 87 appears to be less luminous than cal 83 , it is an eclipsing binary with an eclipse depth of 2 mag ( cowley et al .",
    "an xmm observation suggests that we are seeing only the accretion disk in x - rays and the wd must be more luminous ( orio et al .",
    "a factor of two increase in luminosity would place it on top of our results for 1.35m@xmath1 .",
    "the wd is probably this massive ( cowley et al .",
    "we use the one - dimensional , fully implicit , lagrangian , hydrodynamic computer code described in starrfield et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2000 ) with one major change .",
    "the nuclear reaction network used in those papers was that of weiss and truran ( 1990 ) . in this work ,",
    "we use the pp+cno+rp network of timmes .",
    "we also use the equation of state of timmes ( timmes and arnett 1999 ; timmes and swesty 2000 ) and the opal opacities ( rogers , swenson , & iglesias 1996 ) .",
    "we include the accretion energy as described in shaviv and starrfield ( 1988 ) although it is far smaller than the nuclear energy .",
    "our initial model is obtained by evolving a wd through a cn outburst .",
    "once _ all _ the ejected material is expanding faster than the escape speed , has reached radii exceeding 10@xmath12 cm , and is optically thin ; we remove it from the calculations .",
    "we then take the remnant wd and allow it to cool to @xmath13l@xmath1 before restarting accretion .",
    "we do this for three nova cycles , take the remnant wd from the last cycle , and then begin accretion when the wd luminosity has decreased to @xmath1430 l@xmath1 .",
    "( this luminosity is that found for v1974 cyg three years after outburst : shore et al .",
    "we rezone our initial model so there are 95 zones covering the entire wd ( our results are independent of the number of zones but not the zone mass : see below ) .",
    "the initial model has an outer boundary mass of @xmath15m@xmath1 , a surface zone mass of @xmath16m@xmath1 , and a temperature exceeding @xmath17k .",
    "( we report the effects of the initial luminosity on the evolution in a later paper . )",
    "we used this procedure to calculate initial models for 1.25m@xmath1 , and 1.35m@xmath1 wds .",
    "the core composition was 50%  carbon and 50%  oxygen .",
    "solar composition material was accreted onto these wds at a range of mass accretion rates .",
    "the metallicity of the lmc is about one - third that of the solar neighborhood so we will study the effects of metallicity in a future paper .",
    "this will be important since metallicity clearly affects the evolution of sn ia ( timmes et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the range of @xmath18 over which sn ia are currently being studied implies that they have different metallicities .",
    "we begin the evolution with a bare co core . in sequence 4 , for example , we find that with a surface zone temperature of @xmath19k and density of @xmath20 gm @xmath21 , the energy generation ( @xmath22 ) rises quickly to 10@xmath23erg gm@xmath3s@xmath3 .",
    "the outer layers are strongly heated by this energy release and , after 15 yr of evolution , t@xmath24 ( the temperature in the surface zone ) = @xmath25k , @xmath22 = @xmath26erg gm@xmath3s@xmath3 , and l@xmath27 = @xmath28 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "it is now sufficiently hot in the surface zone so that it takes less time than the time step ( @xmath29s ) for all the infalling hydrogen to burn to helium in this zone .",
    "in addition , some of the helium is already burning to carbon in this zone .",
    "we designate this process surface hydrogen burning ( shb ) .",
    "similar behavior , hydrogen burning out in the surface zone , occurs in all sequences listed in table 1 .",
    "the helium mass fraction declines to zero somewhat deeper into the wd and would have too small an abundance to be seen in the spectrum if this wd were to explode .",
    "we find shb at both wd masses but , for brevity , present only part of the results for 1.35m@xmath1 in table 1 and figure 1 .",
    "the results for other masses , and a detailed discussion of all our evolutionary sequences , will appear elsewhere ( starrfield et al .",
    "the rows in table 1 are the mass accretion rate ( m@xmath30 yr@xmath3 ) , the length of time in years that we have followed the evolution , the amount of mass accreted ( m@xmath1 ) , the temperature ( t@xmath24 ) and rate of energy generation ( @xmath31 ) in the surface zone ( sz ) , the luminosity , and the effective temperature ( both in k and ev ) of the evolutionary sequence .",
    "they are tabulated at the time we end the evolution .",
    "we stopped the evolution in sequences 3 , 4 , and 5 when the central density approached values where carbon burning , not included in our network , should have begun .",
    "sequence 1 exhibited a tnr in the helium layer after @xmath32 yr of evolution but insufficient energy was released to directly eject any material .",
    "this sequence achieved a peak temperature in the tnr exceeding @xmath33k and will be redone with a larger network .",
    "the other evolutionary sequences were hotter and not as degenerate when helium burning began so that no flash occurred .",
    "the final rows give the composition at the interface between the accreted matter and the core matter ( ci ) near or at the end of evolution .",
    "our results show that shb occurs at 1.35m@xmath1 for values of the mass accretion rate typically observed in cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "this implies that if a post - cn system , with a massive wd , can arrive at a configuration where mass transfer onto the wd begins when the wd is still hot and luminous , then the mass of the wd will grow _ even if it is accreting at a rate normally observed only for cvs_. the system does not have to be accreting _ at _ or near to the canonical steady burning rate for the wd to grow in mass to the cl .",
    "our most important result is that in none of our sequences is there any hydrogen ( and little helium ) left in the surface mass zones on the wd .",
    "additional sequences done with finer mass zoning at the surface ( @xmath34m@xmath1 or 100 times smaller than the sequences in this letter ) show that hydrogen and helium reach only to a depth of @xmath35m@xmath1 .",
    "this implies that if such a structure were to explode in a sn ia outburst , then there would be insufficient hydrogen or helium to appear in the spectrum ( lentz et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we also find that for sequences 2 , 3 , and 4 , as the mass accretion rate increases , the abundance of @xmath36c decreases and that of @xmath37o increases . in sequence 1 the helium tnr was responsible for fusing the nuclei to the top of the included network ( mass 20 ) and sequence 5 was sufficiently hot to burn almost all the nuclei to this mass .",
    "therefore , we predict that the c / o ratio in the topmost layers of the ejecta ( observed first and moving the fastest ) will vary between ia explosions and , when measured , would provide an estimate of the accretion rate prior to the ia explosion .",
    "the accretion rate in sequence 5 is above the assumed steady burning rate but it still undergoes shb and does not grow rapidly to large radii and shut off accretion .",
    "a sequence was evolved with an accretion rate of @xmath38m@xmath30 yr@xmath3 and it expanded to large radii after 30 years of evolution .",
    "much larger amounts of mass were accreted onto these wds than in our previous studies of accretion onto low luminosity wds done for studies of cn outbursts ( starrfield et al .",
    "2000 , and references therein ) . in one case ( sequence 5 ) , the mass of the wd increased from 1.35m@xmath1 to @xmath141.38m@xmath1 and the central density grew to @xmath39 g @xmath21 .",
    "clearly , these calculations need to be extended with carbon burning reactions included in the nuclear reaction network .",
    "we compare the results of our calculations to the observations in figure 1 which plots both the luminosity ( l@xmath40 ) and effective temperature of the sequences together with the observations in a theoretical hr - diagram . the final value for each of our sequences is plotted as an asterisk ( * ) and they are connected by a line to guide the eye .",
    "the observed ranges for the sss are plotted as boxes .",
    "cal83 and 1e0035.4 fall close to the results for 1.25m@xmath1 , while cal 87 and rxj0925 fall close to the results for 1.35m@xmath1 .",
    "we predict that these four systems probably contain massive , hot wds accreting at high rates and growing to the cl . while cal 87 falls below the line for 1.35m@xmath1 ,",
    "because it is eclipsing the wd is probably more luminous .",
    "the other two sss are more problematic .",
    "rxj0019 and rxj0439 are in a region of the hr diagram suggesting that they either contain lower mass wds or are recovering from an extended traverse to cooler effective temperatures . given the uncertainties in the observations and the fact that we have only begun this study , the agreement is encouraging .    ) and effective temperatures of our sequences for 1.35m@xmath1 and 1.25m@xmath1 to the observed x - ray luminosities and temperatures for well studied sss .",
    "because the observers only give ranges , we plot their data as boxes with a label indicating the system .",
    "the final values for each of our sequences are plotted as an asterisk ( * ) connected by a line to guide the eye .",
    "the line is labeled by the wd mass . ]",
    "we have investigated the effects of accretion at high rates onto luminous ( 30l@xmath1 ) , hot ( t@xmath7=@xmath41k ) , and massive ( 1.25m@xmath1 and 1.35m@xmath1 ) wds .",
    "we find quiescent burning of hydrogen and helium in the surface layers and , thereby , the growth of the wd to the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "quiescent burning occurs at a large range of mass accretion rates and the luminosities and effective temperatures of our evolutionary sequences agree with those observed for the sss which makes it probable that systems such as cal 87 and cal 83 are the progenitors of sn ia .",
    "we also find , for all but the lowest mass accretion rate , that all the accreted hydrogen and helium is transformed to at least carbon and oxygen in the surface mass zones .",
    "if one of our evolutionary sequences were to explode as a sn ia , then there would be less than @xmath35m@xmath1 of hydrogen and helium in the expanding layers which is unobservable ( lentz et al . 2002 ) .",
    "we also find that the ratio of c / o in the surface zones is a function of mass accretion rate and should vary from one sn ia explosion to another .",
    "an exciting implication of this study is that a cataclysmic variable binary system can produce either a cn or a sss depending primarily on the luminosity of the wd when accretion is initiated after a cn outburst .",
    "therefore , we propose first , that a cn and a sss may be two different phases of the evolution of the same binary system and , second , that a cv system may evolve from a sss to a cn or the reverse at different times of its evolution .",
    "* 1 ) * if cal 83 is a 1.25m@xmath1 wd , then it is accreting at a rate between @xmath42 m@xmath30 yr@xmath3 and @xmath43 m@xmath30 yr@xmath3 . this is less than the steady burning mass accretion rate . *",
    "2 ) * if cal 87 is a 1.35 m@xmath1 wd , then it is also accreting at a rate between @xmath42 and @xmath43 m@xmath30 yr@xmath3 .",
    "since cal 87 is eclipsing , we assume that we are observing only a fraction of the energy emitted by the wd .",
