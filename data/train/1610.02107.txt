    "[ tomk4 ] every edge in a signed subdivision of @xmath47 lies in an even number of negative circles",

    "let @xmath23 be a signed @xmath47 , and let @xmath26 be an edge of @xmath23 .",
    "then , @xmath26 is contained in exactly @xmath0 circles of length @xmath28 , denoted @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and two circles of length @xmath51 , denoted @xmath57 and @xmath58 . using the symbol @xmath59 for symmetric difference ,",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath61 is a positive circle , then @xmath55 and @xmath56 must have the same sign , as well as @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( here we are using the theta property ) .",
    "hence there are an even number of negative circles containing @xmath26 in this case .",
    "if @xmath61 is a negative circle , then @xmath55 and @xmath56 have different signs , as do @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "hence there are two negative circles containing @xmath26 .    if @xmath15 is @xmath9-layered and @xmath26 is separated from a balancing edge @xmath42 , then @xmath9 is the only circle containing both @xmath26 and @xmath42 and hence @xmath43 $ ] is a battery .    in the other direction ,",
    "suppose @xmath43 $ ] is a battery .",
    "we will first prove that @xmath15 is @xmath9-layered , and then we will find the balancing edge .",
    "if there exists some bridge @xmath16 of @xmath9 that has three or more vertices of attachment , then @xmath62 contains a subdivision of @xmath47 ( containing all of @xmath9 ) . by lemma [ tomk4 ] , @xmath26 is contained in at least two negative circles in this subdivision , contradicting the fact that @xmath26 is a battery .",
    "thus , each bridge of @xmath9 must have precisely @xmath0 vertices of attachment ( they ca nt have @xmath27 , since @xmath15 is a block ) .",
    "replace each bridge of @xmath9 with a single chord between its vertices of attachment to form @xmath50 .",
    "we will work in @xmath50 and repeatedly use lemma [ subd ] without mention .",
    "if @xmath9 has two chords @xmath44 and @xmath45 that are crossing , then @xmath46 is a subdivision of @xmath47 containing @xmath9 . since @xmath9 is negative , there are at least two negative circles containing @xmath26 ( lemma [ tomk4 ] ) , which is impossible since @xmath26 is a battery .",
    "thus , @xmath50 is a circle with noncrossing chords .",
    "now we want to prove that @xmath9 has exactly two handles and that @xmath26 must be in one of them .",
    "first , suppose that @xmath26 is contained in a segment of @xmath9 that is not a handle .",
    "thus , the segment of @xmath9 containing @xmath26 meets two different chords at its endpoints , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "consider @xmath46 .",
    "this graph has six circles , denoted @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "we choose the labeling so that @xmath65 and @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "this situation is illustrated in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "if any of @xmath69 , or @xmath64 are negative , @xmath26 is not a battery ( since @xmath9 is also negative ) .",
    "so , assume @xmath69 , and @xmath64 are positive .",
    "the theta property then implies that @xmath55 and @xmath56 are negative .",
    "however , @xmath68 , contradicting the theta property .",
    "therefore , this case is impossible@xmath26 must be contained in a handle .",
    "is not contained in a handle of @xmath9 .",
    "[ f2 ] ]    now , we have @xmath50 with non - crossing chords , and we know @xmath26 is in a handle of @xmath9 . all that remains is to show that there are exactly two handles .",
    "suppose there are ( at least ) three handles , and let their corresponding chords be @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath70 .",
    "each handle along with its chord forms a circle , and we denote these @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "we choose labeling so that @xmath71 , and we write @xmath72 .",
    "this situation is illustrated in figure [ f3 ] .",
    "since @xmath26 is a battery and @xmath9 is negative , we know that @xmath55 is positive .",
    "furthermore , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are negative , and @xmath58 is positive ( using the theta property and the fact that @xmath26 is a battery ) .",
    "however , this implies that @xmath73 is negative , which implies that @xmath74 is negative , contradicting the fact that @xmath26 is a battery .",
    "thus , @xmath28 or more handles are impossible .",
    "is contained in a handle , and there are two other handles .",
    "[ f3 ] ]    finally , we delete the handle of @xmath9 not containing @xmath26 ( denoted @xmath52 ) , destroying the only negative circle containing @xmath26 .",
    "the resulting @xmath75 is still a block , and hence balanced by theorem [ negunbal ] .",
    "thus , we can switch @xmath23 so that the only negative edge is contained in @xmath52 ( lemma [ sw2 ] ) .",
    "consider a battery @xmath43 $ ] separated from a balancing edge @xmath42 , and let @xmath52 be the handle containing @xmath42 .",
    "clearly , every edge in @xmath52 is a balancing edge .",
    "moreover , no edge outside of @xmath52 is a balancing edge .",
    "this is because @xmath76 is a block , and thus @xmath26 is contained in a circle besides @xmath9 with any given edge in @xmath77 .",
    "thus we call @xmath52 the _ balancing handle _ , since it contains all balancing edges of @xmath23 . the presence of a single battery fixes @xmath52 , and as a consequence , we are able to describe the location of all batteries at the same time .    [ allbat ]",
    "suppose @xmath23 has a battery @xmath43 $ ] , separated from a balancing handle @xmath52 .",
    "then , the batteries of @xmath23 are exactly the edges that are separated from @xmath52 by some layering .",
    "theorem [ allbat ] is illustrated in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "is the balancing handle .",
    "the batteries are labeled @xmath78 .",
    "each battery is contained in a handle of a circle whose other handle of @xmath52 .",
    "notice that @xmath15 is @xmath9-layered with respect to any circle @xmath9 that contains a battery .",
    "now let us examine a similar question to the one discussed above  when does a vertex of @xmath23 lie in a unique negative circle @xmath9 ?",
    "we will call such a vertex a _ vertex battery _ , written @xmath79 $ ] when we want to keep track of which circle it is contained in .",
    "fortunately , we have already done enough work to answer this question without too much difficulty .",
    "we can not assume that @xmath15 is a block , since a vertex , unlike an edge , may be contained in many blocks at once ( if the vertex is a cutpoint ) . by theorem [ negunbal ] ,",
    "it is clear that if @xmath6 is a vertex battery , it is contained in one and only one unbalanced block .",
    "this fact , along with the following lemma , allows us to reduce the problem of finding a vertex battery to the problem of finding a battery .",
    "certainly @xmath6 is contained in some negative circle @xmath9 in @xmath16 , by the vertex version of theorem [ negunbal ] .",
    "thus , consider the two edges incident to @xmath6 , say @xmath83 and @xmath84 , that are contained in @xmath9 .",
    "there is a third edge @xmath85 incident with @xmath6 , and therefore there must be some theta graph @xmath86 such that @xmath87 and also @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , @xmath6 is contained in all three circles of @xmath89 .",
    "since @xmath9 is negative , @xmath89 contains an additional unbalanced circle , which contains @xmath6 .",
    "assuming @xmath6 is a vertex battery , let @xmath16 be the single unbalanced block containing @xmath6 , and let @xmath9 be the negative circle of @xmath16 containing @xmath6 .",
    "by lemma [ vertdeg ] , @xmath90 , so let @xmath91 and @xmath92 be the two neighbors of @xmath6 in @xmath16 .",
    "we can _ suppress _",
    "@xmath6that is , replace the edges @xmath93 and @xmath94 with the single edge @xmath95 , setting @xmath96 .",
    "we write the result of the suppression as @xmath97 .",
    "thus , there is a bijective correspondence between the signed circles of @xmath16 and the signed circles of @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , we have the following theorem , which reduces the vertex problem to the edge problem ."
