    "we take into account that the scattering matrix is a functional of the potential and expand the scattering matrix to first order in @xmath47 .",
    "this gives for the transmission and reflection probabilities in the presence of a small absorption @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the transmission probability of the scattering problem without absorption if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are different .",
    "if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are equal , we find a reflection probability @xmath50 thus in the presence of absorption the reflection and transmission probabilities are `` diminished '' according to the partial density of states .",
    "consider now the carriers streaming from contact @xmath5 into the sample in a narrow energy interval @xmath51 .",
    "the incident current @xmath52 must be equal to the sum of the transmitted current @xmath53 , the reflected current @xmath54 and the absorbed current @xmath55 , @xmath56 taking into account that the total incident current from contact @xmath4 is @xmath57 , and taking into account that @xmath58 we find that the total abosrbed flux is given by the sum @xmath59 thus the absorbed flux is determined by the injectivity of contact @xmath5 into the volume of interest .    another way of determining the absorbed flux proceeds as follows .",
    "the absorbed flux is proportional to the integrated density of particles in the region of absorption .",
    "the density of particles can be found from the scattering state @xmath60 which describes carriers incident from contact @xmath61 in channel @xmath62 .",

    "a carrier sink ( as an absorber ) we can ask about a potential which acts as a carrier source .",

    "note that this implies that a small absorption inside a sample can _ increase _ a reflection probability ) .",
    "the fact that the partial density of states are not necessarily positive is a consequence of over specification : both the incident and the exiting channel are prescribed .",
    "in contrast , the injectivities and emissivities are , however , always positive .",
    "the proof is given by eq .",
    "( [ g6 ] ) .",
    "it is well known that with a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) we can measure the local density of states @xcite .",
    "stm measurements are typically performed in a two terminal geometry , in which the tip of the microscope represents one contact and the sample provides another contact @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in the transmission probability from an stm tip into the contact of a sample with two or more contacts as shown in fig .",
    "[ eintip ] .",
    "geometries which use more than one tunneling tip are also of interest @xcite",
    ". thus we deal with a multiterminal transmission problem @xcite .",
    "if we denote the contacts of the sample by a greek letter @xmath74 and use _ tip _ to label the contact of the stm tip , we are interested in the tunneling probabilities @xmath75 from the tip into contact @xmath4 of the sample . in this case",
    "the stm tip acts as carrier source .",
    "similarly we ask about the transmission probability @xmath76 from a sample contact to the tip . in this case",
    "the stm tip acts as a carrier sink .",
    "earlier work has addressed this problem either with the help of electron wave dividers @xcite , or by applying the fermi golden rule @xcite .",
    "recently , gramespacher and the author @xcite have returned to this problem and have derived expressions for these transmission probabilities from the scattering matrix of the full multiprobe problem @xcite ( sample plus tip ) . for a tunneling contact with a density of states",
    "@xmath77 which couples locally at the point @xmath78 with a coupling energy @xmath79 these authors found @xmath80 @xmath81 in a multiterminal sample the transmission probability from a contact @xmath4 to the stm tip is given by the injectivity of contact @xmath4 into the point @xmath78 and the transmission probability from the tip to the contact @xmath4 is given by the emissivity of the point @xmath78 into contact @xmath4 .",
    "( [ w1 ] ) and ( [ w2 ] ) when multiplied by the unit of conductance @xmath82 are generalized bardeen conductances for multiprobe conductors .",
    "since the local density of states of the tip is an even function of magnetic field and since the injectivity and emissivity are related by reciprocity we also have the reciprocity relation @xmath83 .",
    "the presence of the tip also affects transmission and reflection at the massive contacts of the sample . to first order in the coupling energy @xmath84 these probabilities",
    "are given by @xmath85 here the upper index @xmath86 indicates that this transmission probability is calculated in the presence of the tip .",
    "@xmath49 without an upper index is the transmission probability in the absence of the tip .",
    "the correction to the transmission probabilities @xmath87 and reflection probabilities @xmath88 is determined by the partial densities of states , the coupling energy and the density of states in the tip .",
    "note that if these probabilities are placed in a matrix then each row and each column of this matrix adds up to the number of quantum channels in the contacts .",
    "consider a two probe conductor much smaller than any inelastic or phase breaking length .",
    "the conductance of such a conductor can then be said to be coherent and its conductance is at zero temperature given by the landauer formula @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the probability for transmission form one contact to the other .",
    "how is this result affected by events which break the phase or by events which cause inelastic scattering ? to investigate this question ref . proposes to use an additional ( third ) contact to the sample .",
    "the third probe acts as a voltage probe which has its potential adjusted in such a way that there is no net current flowing into this additional probe , @xmath91 .",
    "the current at the third probe is set to zero by floating the voltage @xmath92 at this contact to a value for which @xmath93 vanishes .",
    "the third probe acts , therefore , like a _ voltage probe_. even though the total current at the voltage probe vanishes individual carriers can enter this probe if they are at the same time replaced by carriers emanating from the probe @xcite . entering and leaving a contact are _ irreversible _ processes , since there is no definite phase relationship between a carrier that enters the contact and a carrier that leaves a contact . in a three probe conductor ,",
    "the relationship between currents and voltages is given by @xmath94 where the @xmath95 are the conductance coefficients .",

    "( [ v2 ] ) has a simple interpretation @xcite .",
    "the first term @xmath90 is the transmission probability of the conductor in the absence of the voltage probe .",
    "the first term inside the brackets proportional to the local partial density of states gives the reduction of coherent transmission due to the presence of the voltage probe .",
    "the second term in the brackets is the incoherent contribution to transport due to inelastic scattering induced by the voltage probe .",
    "it is proportional to the injectivity of contact @xmath26 at point @xmath78 .",
    "a fraction @xmath104 of the carriers which reach this point , proportional to its emissivity , are scattered forward and , therefore , contribute to transport .",
    "notice the different signs of these two contributions .",
    "the effect of inelastic scattering ( or dephasing ) can either enhance transport or diminish transport , depending on whether the reduction of coherent transmission ( first term ) or the increase due to incoherent transmission ( second term ) dominates .    instead of a voltage probe , we can also use an optical potential to simulate inelastic scattering or dephasing .",
    "however , in order to preserve current , we must use both an absorbing optical potential ( to take carriers out ) and an emitting optical potential ( to reinsert carriers ) .",
    "the absorbed and re - emitted current must again exactly balance each other @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ g4 ] ) it is seen that the coherent current is again diminished by @xmath105 , i. e. by the partial density of states at point @xmath78 .",
    "the total absorbed current is proportional to @xmath106 , the injectance of contact @xmath26 into this point .",
    "as shown in section 3 a carrier emitting optical potential at @xmath78 generates a current @xmath107 in contact @xmath26 and generates a current @xmath108 in contact @xmath27 .",
    "it produces thus a total current @xmath109 . in order that the generated and the absorbed current are equal we have to normalize the emitting optical potential @xcite such that it generates a total current proportional to @xmath106",
    "the current produced by an optical potential normalized in such a way is thus @xmath110 .",
    "the sum of the two contributions @xcite , the absorbed current and the re - emitted current gives an overall transmission ( or conductance ) which is given by eq .",
    "( [ v2 ] ) with @xmath111 replaced by @xmath47 .",
    "thus the weakly coupled voltage probe ( which has current conservation built in ) and a discussion based on optical potentials coupled with a current conserving re - insertion of carriers are equivalent @xcite .",
    "there are discussions in the literature which invoke optical potentials but do not re - insert carriers .",
    "obviously , such discussions violate current conservation .",
    "even if current is conserved , the partitioning of the reinserted carriers has to be done as described above .",
    "otherwise such fundamental properties like the onsager symmetry are violated @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out that there is in general no reason that tunnel contacts and absorption and re - emission with the help of imaginary potentials lead to identical results .",
    "the equivalence rests on a particular description of the voltage probe .",
    "there are many different ways of coupling a tunnel contact and our description of the voltage probe given here is not unique .",
    "the claim can only be that for sufficiently weak optical absorption and re - insertion of carriers there exits _",
    "one _ voltage probe model which gives the same answer .",
    "the connection between the phase shift of scattering elements and the charge is known as friedel sum rule .",
    "it is most often stated as a global relation between the charge in an energy interval @xmath51 and the derivatives of the scattering phases with respect to energy as @xmath112 .",
    "\\label{friedel1}\\ ] ] from the discussion at the end of section ii it is evident that this relation is not exact since in the applications envisioned here the scattering matrix and the phases are calculated for a finite volume @xmath28 .",

    "( [ friedel1 ] ) to situations in which wkb does not hold has already given rise to statements in the literature that the friedel sum rule does not apply in mesoscopic conductors @xcite .",
    "we next discuss problems for which the self - consistent adjustment of the potential is important . with this goal in mind",
    "we first investigate the variation of the local carrier density @xmath115 in response to a local potential variation @xmath116 at a point @xmath117 .",
    "this variation is given by the lindhard function , @xmath118 .",
    "this function plays an important role if we want to determine the carrier distribution self - consistently .",
    "since the local charge density at equilibrium is @xmath119 , it follows immediately that the lindhard function is given by @xmath120 this response now involves second order functional derivatives of the scattering matrix .",
    "it can be simplified , if we are interested in potential variations not on the microscopic scale but only over distances large to a fermi wave length @xmath121 . in that case",
    "we can integrate the lindhard function over its second argument over a volume that is large compared to a fermi wave length and use the wkb formula which replaces the functional derivative with respect to @xmath122 with an energy derivative .",
    "this gives @xmath123 partial integration with respect to the energy @xmath43 gives @xmath124 over sufficiently large distances the lindhard function is determined by the local density of states .",
    "consider a small deviation @xmath125 of the electrochemical potential @xmath126 of contact @xmath10 away from its equilibrium value @xmath127 . at fixed internal potential",
    "this increases the carrier density inside the conductor by @xmath128 .",
    "this injected charge generates due to the coulomb interaction an electrostatic response @xmath129 which via the lindhard function will also give a contribution to the charge density .",
    "thus the local carrier density is @xcite @xmath130 suppose that all potentials @xmath131 applied to the conductor are rised by the same amount @xmath132 .",
    "since the state of a conductor can only be changed by voltage differences it follows that the electrostatic potential increases also by @xmath133 and that @xmath134 .",

    "<S> we introduce a hierarchy of density of states to characterize the charge distribution in a mesoscopic conductor . at the bottom of this hierarchy are the partial density of states which represent the contribution to the local density of states if both the incident and the out - going scattering channel is prescribed . </S>",
    "<S> the partial density of states play a prominent role in measurements with a scanning tunneling microscope on multiprobe conductors in the presence of current flow . </S>",
    "<S> the partial density of states determine the degree of dephasing generated by a weakly coupled voltage probe . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the partial density of states determine the frequency - dependent response of mesoscopic conductors in the presence of slowly oscillating voltages applied to the contacts of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the partial density of states permit the formulation of a friedel sum rule which can be applied locally . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the off - diagonal elements of the partial density of states matrix to describe charge fluctuation processes . </S>",
    "<S> this generalization leads to a local wigner - smith life - time matrix .    </S>",
    "<S> 2 the characterization of the charge distribution and its fluctuations are a central aspect of electrical conduction theory . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we are concerned with mesoscopic conductors , structures which are so small and cooled to such low temperatures that the wave nature of electron motion becomes apparent . </S>",
    "<S> three recent reviews provide an entry to the literature of this very active field @xcite . of interest </S>",
    "<S> is the charge distribution in such a conductor and its fluctuations under equilibrium and non - equilibrium conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the charge distribution is an intersting quantity in itself . </S>",
    "<S> however , in addition , it is important for the solution of a number of problems . </S>",
    "<S> we mention here only a few : already , in the equilibrium state , the charge distribution needs to be known to determine the effective equilibrium one - electron potential . </S>",
    "<S> it is this potential which determines the scattering properties of the conductor and thus the conductance coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> if voltages are applied which drive the conductor away from the equilibrium state , typically , the charge distribution also undergoes a bias dependent modification . </S>",
    "<S> thus the charge distribution is needed to find the non - linear i - v - characteristic of an electrical conductor . </S>",
    "<S> nanoscopic contacts to a sample measure local density of states and thus a charge distribution . </S>",
    "<S> knowledge of the charge distribution is essential for the discussion of the dynamic conductance like the ac - conductance or photon assisted transport . </S>",
    "<S> the charge distribution also determines the capacitance coefficients of various spatial regions within the mesoscopic structure and also vis - a - vis nearby gates . </S>"
