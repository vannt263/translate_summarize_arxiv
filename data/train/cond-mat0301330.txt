    "<S> we propose to use phonon absorption spectroscopy to study many - body gaps and phases of two - subband heterostructures in the quantum hall regime . implications of the spin - orbit interaction for phonon absorption in this system are considered .    </S>",
    "<S> phonon spectroscopy is a powerful experimental technique that has been successfully used in the study of the properties of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas in the quantum hall regime [ 1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it allows probing of the states with non - zero momentum , which are not accessible by either cyclotron resonance or photoluminescence methods . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to use acoustic - phonon spectroscopy to study many - body effects in a two - subband quasi-2d system , formed at a single semiconductor heterojunction and subjected to a quantizing magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the formation of many - body gaps and the existence of different spin phases in this system result in a striking difference in the magnetic field dependence of the phonon absorption rate at different filling factors </S>",
    "<S> .    acoustic - phonon scattering of 2d electrons in a quantizing magnetic field is strongly suppressed due to the dispersionless structure of the landau levels ( lls ) . in a two - subband system , however , a sharp enhancement of the electron - phonon interaction occurs when the two lls corresponding to different size - quantization subbands ( we consider the second ll of the first subband and the first ll of the second subband only ) approach one another , and the separation between these energy levels , @xmath0 , becomes close to @xmath1 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is the cyclotron energy , @xmath3 is the intersubband splitting , @xmath4 is the velocity of sound and @xmath5 is the magnetic length . </S>",
    "<S> this electron - phonon interaction enhancement should manifest itself in the magnetic field dependence of the phonon absorption rate and dissipative conductivity . at filling factor slightly greater than two , </S>",
    "<S> when the electron - electron interaction between the particles belonging to either of the intersecting lls can be neglected , a double - peak structure in the magnetic field dependence of the phonon - mediated transport properties of the two - subband system has been predicted [ 2 ] . with increasing electron density , the repulsion between the levels due to electron - electron exchange interactions opens a gap in the interlevel excitation spectra . at filling factor @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> this gap exists at all values of the bare level splitting @xmath7 and can well exceed @xmath1 . as a result , the double - peak structure transforms into a single - peak one ( see figure 1 ) . by far the most interesting case is when the electron filling factor @xmath8 . when the cyclotron energy is close to the intersubband splitting the system can be mapped onto a four - level electron system with an effective filling factor @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is either a ferromagnetic state or a spin - singlet state , depending on the values of the interlevel splitting and zeeman energy @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - electron interaction renormalizes the phase boundaries , which results in the existence of a ferromagnetic phase even for @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation spectrum has a gap for any value of the interlevel splitting @xmath7 and zeeman splitting @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this results in strong suppression of the electron - phonon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of phonon absorption by the considered quasi-2d electron system at @xmath8 again has a double - peak structure as a function of level splitting and a steplike structure as a function of zeeman splitting ( see figure 2 ) .    in the absence of the spin - orbit interaction , </S>",
    "<S> the transitions between levels with different spin indices are forbidden because the electron - phonon interaction conserves the electron spin . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit interaction allows such transitions . </S>",
    "<S> matrix elements of the spin - orbit interaction hamiltonian @xmath12 between levels differing by subband number , ll number , and spin projection on the normal to the structure plane , are given by following expressions [ 3 ] : @xmath13 where @xmath14 \\right ) \\cdot \\mathbf{s}$ ] , @xmath15 $ ] , @xmath16 and @xmath17 numerate subbands , @xmath18 is the ll number , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are phenomenological spin - orbit constants of the semiconductor [ 4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the expressions for @xmath21 and @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the quantum - well confinement potential . </S>",
    "<S> these matrix elements cause an admixture of states with opposite spin direction to both the initial and final states for the phonon absorption . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the phonon absorption rate at @xmath8 never becomes zero ; in the region between peaks , it is of the order of @xmath25 times its value at the peak of absorption , where @xmath26 is the corresponding matrix element of the spin - orbit interaction ( eq.(1 ) ) , and @xmath27 is the many - body energy gap .    in the absence of many - body effects , the inter - subband spin - orbit coupling results in anticrossing of levels with different spin , subband and ll indices . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting energy gaps can be measured by high - resolution spectroscopic techniques ( optical or spin / cyclotron resonance spectroscopy ) , as has been suggested for one - subband systems in tilted magnetic fields [ 5 ] .    </S>",
