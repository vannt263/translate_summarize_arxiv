    "the above works have mainly concentrated on the statistics associated with the discrete plastic event , involving either energy release , plastic strain magnitude or the avalanche velocity  @xcite , but not that of the critical stress at which the event occurs .",
    "this focus has partly arisen from the view that the plastic strain event is the material `` response '' to the `` stimulus '' of an applied stress , and that near criticality , this material response is only weakly correlated to the stimulus . despite this , the stress variable has played an important role in recent works investigating the theme of to what degree a material is in a state of criticality . when the global yield of material is viewed as a static depinning transition  @xcite , criticality",
    "is only achieved at the depinning stress . below this stress ,",
    "the statistics associated with the plastic strain event are truncated from a pure power law distribution by scaling functions depending on how far away the applied stress is from the critical stress .",
    "the alternative view of yield as a dynamic unjamming event  @xcite has the material in a critical state at all applied stresses  @xcite . here",
    "dislocation dynamics simulations show a stress and system size dependent truncation of the plastic strain statistics , but no indication of the critical stress associated with a depinning transition .    from an engineering perspective ,",
    "the stresses at which plasticity occurs are of crucial importance .",
    "if the onset of plasticity is associated with the global failure of a material , one very useful approach to understand the statistics of the failure stress is via the weakest link principle associated with extreme value theory  the so - called weibull approach  @xcite . here , a realization of a particular material is given by a sequence of @xmath0 critical stresses , the smallest ( weakest ) of which will correspond to the stress at which the material globally fails .",
    "for a flaw - based failure scenario , these critical stresses correspond and characterize @xmath0 regions within the material containing the flaws .",
    "mathematically , such a characterization of the material is given by a positive valued master probability density function ( pdf ) of critical stresses and @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the flaw density .",
    "sampling this master distribution @xmath0 times , the statistics of the smallest value is found to be well described by the weibull distribution  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the fisher - tippett - gnedenko ( ftg ) theorem  @xcite states that for a very broad class of positive valued probability distributions and for sufficiently large values of @xmath0 , the statistics of the minimum ( extreme ) value is well described by a weibull distribution with corresponding scale and shape parameters that do depend on the probability distribution and @xmath0 .    for strongly heterogeneous ceramics and brittle metals ,",
    "in which global failure is known to originate from a single local flaw , weibull statistics can well describe the fluctuations in the corresponding failure stress .",
    "however , for a general crystalline metal yield is an emergent phenomenon associated with the collective behaviour of the underlying dislocation network , and extreme value statistics or the weakest link principle is not expected to be so useful .",
    "it has however long been recognized that the onset of permanent deformation is very dependent on the instrumental resolution of the deformation apparatus , and that the transition to global yield is preceded by a plasticity that chalmers first termed micro - plasticity  @xcite .",
    "indeed , many years ago tinder and co - workers  @xcite , using torsion with an incredible strain resolution of @xmath3 , showed such plasticity could occur in cu and zn crystals well below their known yield stresses via discrete and intermittent plastic events . between such plastic events , perfectly elastic regions of deformation",
    "were observed with corresponding moduli comparable to that determined by ultrasound techniques .",
    "this latter aspect demonstrated the high quality of these early torsion experiments .",
    "thus , with sufficient strain resolution , the transition to bulk yield is a gradual but discrete process mediated by intermittent plasticity  a viewpoint which is quite consistent with the modern work of stochastic plasticity , which indicates that at low enough stresses the strain displacement distributions associated with the initial plastic events are truncated power - laws resulting in a local , less collective , plasticity  @xcite .",
    "this regime of plasticity should therefore be amenable to the extreme value statistics framework , where the material admits a density of uncorrelated regions defined by critical stresses at which local plasticity can be initiated .",
    "the corresponding master distribution ( along with @xmath1 ) would therefore characterize the underlying microstucture prior to loading in terms of these critical stresses .",
    "this approach has been taken in refs .",
