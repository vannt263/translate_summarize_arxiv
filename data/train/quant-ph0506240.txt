    "experiments on the orbital angular momentum [ oam ] of light confirmed recently an uncertainty principle for angular position and angular momentum @xcite . whereas for separable quantum states uncertainty principles limit the accuracy for measurements of non - commuting observables , inseparable or entangled states may apparently overcome these limits .",
    "this was first discussed by einstein , podolsky and rosen in their famous _ gedankenexperiment _",
    "@xcite and led to the formulation of the epr paradox @xcite .",
    "the implications of the epr paradox have been tested mainly on optical systems , e.g.  on the polarisation of photons @xcite , quadrature phase components @xcite or directly on the optical version of epr s original example , the linear momentum and linear position of photons @xcite .",
    "the relation between oam and its conjugate variable , the angular position , is fundamentally different from these systems , because oam is a discrete quantum observable of infinite dimension and the angular position is continuous and bounded .",
    "the entanglement for oam of photon pairs generated in parametric down conversion has been confirmed both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to examine the possibility to demonstrate an ` angular ' epr paradox for this pair of observables , in particular as the necessary experimental techniques have already been employed in recent work in this field @xcite .",
    "apart from the fundamental interest in angular epr correlations , the criterion for an epr paradox for oam and angular position of light provides a tool to characterise entanglement for these observables . using variances in violations of local uncertainty relations as entanglement criteria",
    "has received renewed interest .",
    "formerly applied to continuous variables on a specific example @xcite , it has been shown that variances of special observables can be used to detect entanglement in finite - dimensional system @xcite .",
    "this approach has been generalised to arbitrary observables and led to entanglement criteria for finite dimensional systems @xcite which are known from the continuous variable regime @xcite .",
    "a practical motivation for studying entanglement of optical oam arises from the possible advantages of oam in quantum information processes @xcite and quantum communication , as cryptographic schemes @xcite could profit from an enlarged basis of states .",
    "oam of light is connected with the azimuthal phase structure of light beams : each photon in a beam with phase dependence @xmath0 carries an oam of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the oam number @xmath2 can take on any integer number which leads to a discrete , infinite dimensional quantum system .",
    "the conjugate variable is the angular or azimuthal position @xmath3 , which we choose to lie within the @xmath4 radian interval starting at angle @xmath5 .",
    "the associated uncertainty relation is then @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the angular probability density at the boundary of the chosen interval .",
    "the topology of the basis sets is reflected in their fourier relation ; in contrast to the linear case a discrete fourier transform allows us to change from oam representation to angle representation : @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the wavefunction in the angle representation and @xmath11 the oam probability amplitude . the @xmath4 radian interval is commonly chosen to be @xmath12 , and we set @xmath13 from here on .    it has been experimentally demonstrated that oam of light is conserved under parametric down conversion @xcite . in theoretical studies ,",
    "it has been pointed out that the conservation of oam is related to the phase matching condition for parametric down conversion processes @xcite .",
    "entanglement in oam and azimuthal position is a consequence of this phase matching @xcite .",
    "the conservation of transverse momentum requires that the two - photon wavefunction for the signal ( 1 ) and idler ( 2 ) mode , for a plane wave pump , has to be of the form @xmath14 . using a simplified approach",
    "one can argue that the transverse spatial correlations in the far field originate from the momentum conservation under parametric down conversion .",
    "identifying transverse momentum components in the near field with spatial coordinates in the far field allows us to write the spatial dependence of the wavefunction in position representation as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the radial and azimuthal coordinates and @xmath18 is the @xmath4 periodic delta function . from this result",
    "we can expect the azimuthal angles of the photons in the far field to obey @xmath19 , so that the signal and idler photons appear on opposite sides of their respective cones .",
    "the correlation in angular momentum follows on writing eq .",
    "( [ eq : anglecorr ] ) in terms of its angular fourier components : @xmath20 which is an entangled superposition of states with zero total oam .",
    "a more detailed analysis which considers a specific parametric down conversion process shows that more complicated dependences of the wavefunction on the azimuthal angles are also possible @xcite .",
    "the epr paradox describes the apparent violation of the uncertainty principle resulting from measurements on correlated , spatially separated systems .",
    "the original epr argument considers correlations that are strong enough to predict or infer with certainty the value of the observables in one subsystem from measurements on the other , separated , subsystem without disturbing in any way the first subsystem .",
    "the ability to predict with certainty the value of an observable defines , according to epr , an element of reality .",
    "however , non - commuting observables , can not have a simultaneous reality , an expression of which is the uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "the tension between local elements of reality and quantum complementarity leads to the paradox .",
    "the original epr _ gedankenexperiment _ considers an idealised situation .",
    "the quantum state given by epr on the example of the position and momentum is  in the modern language of entanglement  a maximally entangled state @xcite , and the measurement of the observables is assumed to be infinitely precise . for oam and angular position this idealised setting would require a parametric down conversion process which creates an entangled photon pair , perfectly correlated in oam and angular position .",
    "an errorless measurement of the oam on the signal photon could then be used to infer the oam of the idler photon , and an errorless measurement of the azimuthal angle on the signal photon would allow us to predict precisely the angle of the idler photon .",
    "as these measurements on the signal photon ` do not disturb the idler photon in any way ' , the predictions would constitute simultaneous elements of reality for the oam and the azimuthal angle of the idler photon .",
    "we stress that the possibility to predict observables of the idler photon with certainty depends on the ability to measure the observables on the signal photon without error .",
    "in particular for a continuous observable a measurement with infinite precision can not be realised experimentally .",
    "a typical experimental setup would allow us to determine whether a continuous variable falls into a previously specified range .",
    "to analyse the possibility of demonstrating an epr paradox experimentally a more realistic situation has to be studied .",
    "this requires the consideration of non - maximal correlations and of measurements with finite precision leading to an error in inferring one observable from a measurement on the other subsystem .",
    "the size of this error determines whether the epr paradox can be demonstrated in the considered experimental setup @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of experimental indeterminacies requires a reformulation of the epr paradox .",
    "in contrast to the original epr setup @xcite , we consider conditional measurements on both subsystems . in reference to the idealised setup in section ( [ ssc : eprpara ] ) , we look at the variance of the oam or the azimuthal position in the idler beam given a specifically set outcome of a measurement in the signal beam . for the oam",
    "this condition will be the measurement of a single @xmath21 value , whereas for the azimuthal position the measurement will be in a range of angles .",
    "for the oam we denote the conditional variance with @xmath22 $ ] , i.e.  the variance of @xmath23 in the idler under the condition that a measurement on the signal photon yields an oam of @xmath24 .",
    "the condition for the azimuthal position to fall in a range of angles will be treated as a probability density @xmath25 .",
    "the functional dependence of the probability density is given by @xmath26 and the variable @xmath27 is used to indicate the orientation . for a symmetric @xmath26 , @xmath27 would be the central angle .",
    "the conditional variance for the angle can thus be written as @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "for an actual experiment the error caused by non - maximum correlations is thus included in measured quantities and the theoretical modelling , therefore , concentrates on the description of the error in the measurement .",
    "schemes to measure oam have been theoretically studied and experimentally realised @xcite .",
    "we are therefore mostly concerned with a description of the angle measurement . in the following",
    "we give the criterion for the experimental demonstration of an angular epr paradox as one main result of this work .      in the previous section ( [ ssc : eprpara ] )",
    "we pointed out the importance of inference in epr type arguments . to distinguish a measured quantity from an inferred one we label the first with an index @xmath29 and the latter with an index @xmath30 .",
    "the measured quantities are the conditional probability for the oam @xmath31_{\\mathsf{m}}$ ] and the conditional probability density for the azimuthal angle @xmath32_{\\mathsf{m}}$ ] .",

    "the vertex of the separation angle is on the pump axis . in our work",

    "the question if they are compatible for the degenerate case is a very interesting one , but it will not be examined in the scope of this work .",

    "a recent study on the epr paradox for linear optical momentum and position @xcite included a theoretical prediction of the conditional probabilities .",

    "= 0.49 = 0.49      the theoretical modelling of a conditional angle measurement leads to a conditional variance significantly different from zero .",

    "the dependence of @xmath81 $ ] on the aperture functions @xmath79 and @xmath46 reflects the way in which the azimuthal angle is measured .    from the presented results ,",
    "it is clear that the broadness of the conditional angle probability density and the oam probability distribution is mostly determined by @xmath26 .",
    "the influence of the analyzing aperture @xmath82 is certainly most controllable for the rectangular case .",
    "but the analysis of tsgs showed that there are values of @xmath125 for which the influence of @xmath82 is comparable to the rectangular case without showing the divergent variance . using these apertures to study the influence of the analyzing aperture on the conditional probability distribution could lead to a more detailed model for the measurement process and thus to a more complete theoretical prediction for the final conditional oam variance . on the other hand , for tsgs",
    "the question remains how well the aperture can be programmed in an slm , in particular as for high values of @xmath125 the features which distinguish it from a rectangular aperture are on a very small scale .",
    "this however might be an interesting aspect in a more detailed analysis of rectangular apertures , which includes optical diffraction , as even small deviations from a perfect rectangular form would give a finite conditional variance .",
    "in this work we have discussed the possibility to demonstrate an angular epr paradox for the conjugate variables of orbital angular momentum [ oam ] and angle .",
    "the paradox is about the apparent violation of an uncertainty relation for incompatible observables measured on correlated , spatially separated subsystems . by using photon pairs entangled in oam and in angle these subsystems",
    "can be realised in an optical experiment .",
    "we have found a testable criterion for an angular epr paradox , which takes experimental indeterminacies into account .",
    "for that we have reformulated the epr paradox using conditional variances , i.e.  variances of observables from one subsystem given a preset outcome on the other subsystem .    to investigate the feasibility of an experimental demonstration , we have modeled the measurement process under the assumption of perfect angle correlation .",
    "also , angular apertures to set the condition or to determine the angle were assumed to impose their probability characteristics exactly on transmitted photons . under these assumptions",
    "we have studied different classes of aperture functions for the final conditional oam variance .",
    "rectangular functions lead to a divergent conditional oam variance , which does not set any lower bound for the correlations in oam for our criterion .",
    "truncated gaussians result in a quickly converging variance , but the implementation of the apertures with a smooth grayscale transition on an slm will be less accurate than for rectangular apertures with their sharp edge .",
    "truncated super gaussians , which can be varied from the rectangular case to the truncated gaussians , provide an aperture which leads to a convergent variance and still has a controllable influence of the analysing apertures in the idler .",
    "the conditional variances obtained from the theoretical modelling show that an angular epr paradox can be demonstrated . given the current state of experiments we expect an implementation of our criterion to be able to demonstrate the epr paradox for oam and azimuthal position .",
