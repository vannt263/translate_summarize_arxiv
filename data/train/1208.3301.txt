    "this comes mostly from the decrease of the coulomb energy because of the presence of other fragments ( see eq .",

    "the fragment density is comparatively higher which explains the larger gap in binding energy with reference to the phase equilibrium calculation . for a given baryon density",

    "a benchmark calculation of the hot fragments in phase - equilibrium with its own vapor was also done . in both cases",
    ", it was seen that the fragments expand with temperature as expected , but compared to the results from the phase - equilibrium ( benchmark ) calculation , the embedding medium in multifragmentation produced larger changes in the fragment properties .",

    "the origin of such a limiting temperature is usually traced to an interplay between the coulomb instability and the corrections due to the finite size of the nuclear drops .",
