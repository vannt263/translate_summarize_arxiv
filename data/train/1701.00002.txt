    "the first fuv bow shock was discovered by @xcite around j0437 .",
    "these authors tested two spectral models for fuv emission . a pl continuum model , with @xmath180 in the fuv range ( @xmath181",
    "if the pl spectrum extends to the optical range ) , could correspond to synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons leaked from the x - ray pwn region and trapped at the forward bow shock .",
    "the other model , favored by @xcite , was the spectrum emitted by the ism matter heated and compressed in a collisionless shock ( shells model in @xcite ) ; it was consistent with the measured bow shock fluxes at reasonable values of the shock ( pulsar ) velocity and upstream ism density .",
    "the bow shock of j2124 is dimmer and has a lower @xmath80 , which prevents us from performing a similarly detailed analysis .",
    "nevertheless , we can compare general properties of the j2124 shock with those of the j0437 shock .",
    "the fuv bow shocks of both pulsars are spatially coincident with the h@xmath15 bow shocks ( see figure  [ hst ] ) .",
    "in contrast to j0437 , the j2124 bow shock shows a significant asymmetry of its shape with respect to the proper motion direction , which has been attributed to a local ism density gradient perpendicular to the pulsar s direction of motion @xcite .",
    "interestingly , there is also an asymmetry in shock brightness , opposite in the the h@xmath15 and fuv images ( compare the top - left and bottom - right panels in figure [ hst ] ) ; the reason of this asymmetry remains unclear .",
    "in addition to the asymmetry , the head ( apex region ) of the fuv - h@xmath15 j2124 bow shock is `` flatter '' than the head of the j0437 bow shock .",
    "this could be caused by anisotropy of the pulsar wind , such that the wind is concentrated in the pulsar s equatorial plane that is nearly perpendicular to the pulsar s velocity @xcite .",
    "the fuv luminosity , @xmath182@xmath183 erg s@xmath2 , extracted from the @xmath184 arcsec@xmath151 area of the j2124 bow shock is a factor of @xmath185 higher than the fuv luminosity from the @xmath186 arcsec@xmath151 area of the j0437 shock .",
    "however , the ( distance - independent ) mean specific intensity , @xmath187 erg @xmath3 s@xmath2 arcsec@xmath188 for the j2124 bow shock , is a factor of 2.8 lower than that of the j0437 shock .",
    "such a difference could be partly due to the fact that the width of the extraction region of the j2124 shock was somewhat broader than the actual width of the bright shock area .",
    "in addition , the more distant j2124 shock was imaged at larger physical separations in units of length from the apex , where the shock becomes intrinsically dimmer .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the specific intensities of the j2124 and j0437 shocks are close to each other at the same ( physical ) separations from the apices . since in the ism shock interpretation",
    "the emitted shock flux per unit emitting area is crudely proportional to the upstream density and only weakly depends on the pulsar velocity in the relevant range of parameters ( see figure 6 of @xcite ) , it means that the ism densities ahead of the j0437 and j2124 shocks are close to each other .    for pulsar j0437",
    ", @xcite used the ratio of the f125lp and f140lp count rates , @xmath189 , to estimate the slope of the j0437 spectrum in the fuv range , @xmath190 ( see figure  4 in @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , for j2124 , we have @xmath191 , from which we infer @xmath192 , i.e. , a very steeply decreasing @xmath193 spectrum .",
    "this result , however , suffers from the large uncertainty of the f140lp count rate .",
    "such a steep spectrum can not be extrapolated to the optical ( f475x ) band because the extrapolated spectral flux would greatly exceed the upper limit in that filter , which requires a fuv - optical slope @xmath194 ( see figure [ limits ] ) , corresponding to @xmath195 .",
    "unless the count rate uncertainties are greatly underestimated due to unaccounted systematic errors , this discrepancy can be considered as an argument for a shock sed more complex than a simple pl .    in the shocked ism emission model",
    "the ratio of fuv and h@xmath15 fluxes depends on the model parameters .",
    "@xcite report the h@xmath15 photon flux @xmath196photonss@xmath2@xmath3 , or energy flux @xmath197ergs@xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds to the ratio of f125lp to h@xmath15 energy fluxes of @xmath198 , although this value can be larger ( by a factor of up to 2 ) because we do not know the exact apex areas used by @xcite . for comparison , the flux ratio in the same filters for j0437 is @xmath199 ( figure  6 in @xcite ) , i.e. , generally consistent with j2124 .",
    "the non - detection of the j2124 bow shock in the f475x image provides additional constraints on the spectral shape and , possibly , on the emission mechanism .",
    "figure  [ limits ] shows a single pl model and a shocked ism model ( normalized to fuv flux measurement ) compatible with the @xmath150 f475x upper limit .",
    "the shocked ism model appears to be able to describe the measurements ; however , given the complexity of the model and the scarcity of the data , we do not attempt to fit it .",
    "the detection of the fuv bow shock around two pulsars allows one to assume that such shocks can be detected from many other pulsars , including those from which no h@xmath15 shock is seen because of a lack of neutral hydrogen atoms upstream of the shock .",
    "such observations , currently possible only with the _ hst _ , would be very useful for studying the ism properties and the physics of relativistic shocks .",
