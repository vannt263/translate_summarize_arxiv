    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons were first observed by the ua1 and ua2 experiments at cern thirty years ago in proton - antiproton collisions at @xmath2 gev @xcite . since then a succession of electron - positron",
    ", proton - proton ( pp ) and proton - antiproton collider experiments have been used to measure their properties , such as mass , decay width and production cross sections at a variety of center - of - mass energies .",
    "now for the first time , due to the large center - of - mass energy and luminosities offered at the lhc , the @xmath1 and @xmath0 boson production can be studied in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "based on the first lead - lead ( pbpb ) collisions corresponding to 7.2 @xmath3b@xmath4 integrated luminosity , the cms collaboration reported first results on the @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite processes , showing electroweak bosons are essentially unmodified by the hot and dense medium created in heavy - ion collisions , often referred to as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "@xmath1-boson production is reported in this proceedings with the second set of pbpb collisions that occurred in late 2011 and accounts for 150  @xmath3b@xmath4 integrated luminosity . in this document ,",
    "the second set of pp data at the same energy in the center - of - mass , recorded in 2013 , is used as a reference in order to calculate the nuclear modification factor , @xmath7 .",
    "the increases in statistics of both the pp and pbpb samples allow more detailed study of the transverse momentum ( @xmath8 ) , rapidity ( @xmath9 ) and collision centrality dependencies of the @xmath1-boson yields .",
    "the dimuon channel is analyzed with an improved reconstruction algorithm with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite , and electrons are used for the first time to reconstruct the z decays in the heavy - ion environment in cms @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 bosons , once produced , decay within the medium with a typical lifetime of 0.1 fm / c . since leptons pass freely through the strongly - interacting medium , dileptons from @xmath1 bosons can serve as a reference to the processes expected to be heavily modified in the qgp , such as quarkonium production , or the production of an opposite - side jet in @xmath1+jet processes  @xcite .",
    "however , in heavy - ion collisions , @xmath1-boson production can be slightly affected by initial - state effects .",
    "this modification is expected to be about 3% from the different mix of protons and neutrons in aa collisions ( isospin effect )  @xcite .",
    "energy loss and multiple scattering of the initial partons could produce modifications of the order of 3%  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the parton distribution functions can be depleted in nuclei , which could modify the @xmath1-boson yield by at most 20% @xcite .",
    "with respect to the previous analysis reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , a new muon offline reconstruction algorithm is used for the pbpb data , with increased efficiency via multiple iterations in the pattern recognition step .",
    "the single - muon reconstruction efficiency is raised from @xmath10% to @xmath11% , for muons from @xmath1 decays , reaching the level of the algorithm used for pp collisions .",
    "background muons from cosmic rays and heavy - quark semileptonic decays are rejected by requiring a transverse ( longitudinal ) distance of closest approach of less than 0.2 ( 5.0 ) mm from the measured vertex .",
    "these selection criteria further reject about 2% of real muons for both pp and pbpb collisions .",
    "the electron reconstruction uses information from the pixel and strip tracker , and the electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) .",
    "electrons produced in pp or pbpb collisions traversing the silicon layers of the tracker can emit bremsstrahlung photons and deposit energy in the ecal with a significant spread in the azimuthal direction . an ecal clustering algorithm and in particular the building of so - called _ superclusters _ , was used for collecting and estimating the proper energy of photons in the heavy - ion environment as in ref .",
    "pixels facing these superclusters are looked for , in order to initiate the building of trajectories in the inner tracker . a dedicated algorithm which takes into account the bremsstrahlung emission",
    "is used @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction algorithm results in a reconstruction efficiency of  85% for electrons from @xmath1 decays .",
    "further selection criteria reduce this efficiency by about 10% . for the pp sample , the standard algorithms and identification criteria presented in ref .",
    "@xcite are used , resulting in a reconstruction efficiency of @xmath12 and a further reduction of @xmath13 due to selection criteria .",
    "figures [ invmassmuon ] and [ invmasselectron ] show the dimuon and dielectron invariant mass spectra in the 60120  gev/@xmath14 mass range after applying selection criteria in pp and pbpb collisions . only leptons with @xmath15 gev/@xmath16 and @xmath17 2.4 and 1.44 for the muons and the electrons , respectively ,",
    "are considered .",
    "the dimuon rapidity is limited to @xmath18 , while the dielectron rapidity is kept in the @xmath19 range .",
    "overlaid histograms are from the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .    in the 60120  gev/@xmath14 mass range of the pbpb sample ,",
    "1022 events are found with opposite - charge ( oc , black solid circles ) muons and not a single same charge ( sc , black open squares ) muon pair , while the pp sample has 830 oc and 1 sc pair . in the restricted dielectron rapidity range , 328 ( 388 )",
    "oc electrons are measured in the pbpb ( pp ) data , with 27 ( 17 ) sc pairs resulting from higher fake and charge mis - identification rates .",
    "the sc pairs provide a measure of uncorrelated combinatorial background : negligible ( 1/1000 level ) in the muon channel , and @xmath208% ( 4)% in the electron channel .",
    "the number of @xmath1 candidates is taken as the oc ",

    "the nuclear overlap function @xmath28 , computed with a glauber model @xcite is proportional to the number of elementary nucleon - nucleon binary collisions @xmath29 where the latter is an assumed inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section that cancels to first order in @xmath28 .",
