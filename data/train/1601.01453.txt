    "driven by the exponentially increased wireless data traffic , the cellular network is expected to become increasingly heterogeneous to improve the spectral efficiency as we move to the 5 g cellular network @xcite .",
    "however , the deployment of massive small - cells in the macro - cells can increase the total power consumption of the 5 g heterogeneous networks ( hetnets ) @xcite .",
    "the power consumption of a hetnet comes from both the macro - cell base stations ( mbss ) and the small - cell base stations ( sbss ) .",
    "researchers have paid much attention to study power saving at the mbs side , by dynamically changing the mbss on and off states to meet the stochastic traffic ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) , but very few work has considered power saving at the sbss .    as there are increasingly more small - cells deployed in the 5 g cellular network , their power consumption is not ignorable .",
    "_ in @xcite showed that in many european countries , the typical power consumption of a sbs is @xmath0w and that of an mbs is @xmath1w .",
    "thus , the power consumption of @xmath2 sbss ( or small - cells ) is larger than that of an mbs ( or macro - cell ) . as a result , it is important to jointly manage the power consumption of macro - cells and small - cells for more energy - efficient operation with traffic sharing . according to @xcite ,",
    "the mbs and the sbs are different in their power consumption rates with their traffic loads .",
    "the mbs s power consumption increases exponentially with its traffic load in terms of the number of users served given each user has a constant rate requirement @xcite , while the sbs s power consumption is almost independent of its load and even flat for any load @xcite , @xcite .",
    "data offloading from the mbs to the sbss thus helps save the mbs s power consumption but inevitably requires more sbss to be turned on and increases the total power consumption of the sbss .",
    "the operator should be aware of this in designing the traffic sharing among the macro- and small - cells , and should also consider the heterogeneity of small - cells in location and user coverage .",
    "this thus motivates this paper to investigate the dynamic adaptation of the sbss operation modes ( on or off ) to save the total power consumption in the 5 g hetnet while meeting all users service requirements . to study the sbss dynamic operation for the small - cells ,",
    "we make a practical assumption that the mbs is always active to provide the seamless coverage of control signal and avoid any service failure to serve users outside active small - cells@xcite .",
    "though we focus on small - cell dynamic operation , our approach does not exclude prior macro - cell operation schemes .",
    "the mbss and the sbss are dynamically operated over different spatial and time scales .",
    "small - cells are dynamically operated inside a macro - cell , while a macro - cell is dynamically operated in a much larger range .",
    "turning on or off an mbs usually takes several minutes@xcite , while a sbs can be quickly turned on or off in seconds@xcite .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    * _ novel small - cell dynamic operation to minimize the total hetnet power consumption : _ we study dynamic small - cell on / off operation to serve offloaded traffic from the macro - cell for minimizing the total power consumption of the hetnet .",
    "we model different power consumption patterns for both the mbs and the sbss with respect to their traffic load , where the sbss locations and their user coverage areas are taken into account . * _ small - cell dynamic operation to serve uniformly distributed users : _ we take the spatial randomness of the user locations into consideration .",
    "we start with a special case with uniformly distributed users in the hetnet in section iii , where user densities in all the small - cells and the macro - cell are identical .",
    "we propose an optimal location - based operation algorithm to decide the operation modes of the sbss according to their distances to the mbs to minimize the total hetnet power consumption . * _ small - cell dynamic operation to serve non - uniformly distributed users : _ we then extend to a more general case with non - uniformly distributed users in the hetnet in section iv , where the user density varies over different small - cells and the macro - cell . in this case , the hetnet power minimization problem is shown to be np - hard .",
    "we propose a location - and - density - based operation algorithm that provides a near - optimal operation solution in polynomial time to decide the sbss on / off states . *",
    "_ performance evaluation : _ in section v , through extensive simulations , we show that the location - and - density - based operation algorithm achieves less than 1% performance loss as compared to the optimal one . by comparing with two benchmark schemes with no sbs on / off adaptation and probability - based sbs on / off adaptation , respectively ,",
    "we show that our proposed small - cell operation scheme can more efficiently save the total hetnet power consumption .",
    "we also show that the mbs s power consumption can even decrease with the increasing hetnet traffic load under our proposed scheme , as more small - cells are turned on to offload the macro - cell traffic .",
    "recently , hetnet dynamic operation for power saving draws significant attention and many prior studies have focused on macro - cells intelligent operations ( e.g.,@xcite ) . among these works , there are two major approaches : cell zooming and base station ( bs ) sleeping .",
    "the approach of cell zooming proposed in @xcite reduces the macro - cell power consumption by adjusting the cell size according to the covered traffic load , the quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements and the channel conditions .",
    "the power saving potential of the cell zooming approach was further studied in @xcite .",
    "bs sleeping is the second major approach to save power by switching bss between on and off . as a pioneering work , marsan _ et al . _ in @xcite showed that 25 - 30% of the total power consumption can be saved by reducing the number of active macro - cells when the traffic is low .",
    "considering the users traffic variations over both space and time , the authors in @xcite jointly applied tools from stochastic geometry and dynamic programming to design the optimal bs on / off adaptation scheme .",
    "the application and extension of this approach in practical systems have also been extensively studied in , e.g. , @xcite , where various implementable bs on / off algorithms were proposed . besides these two approaches , user association for load balancing between macro - cells and small - cells was studied in @xcite . however , all these studies overlooked the impact of small - cells dynamic operation on the total hetnet power consumption .    as a preliminary work , ashraf _ et al .",
    "_ in @xcite showed that small - cell sleeping has great power - saving potential .",
    "the studies in @xcite further exploited this potential and proposed small - cell control algorithms for power saving .",
    "however , these studies focused on small - cells only , and proposed to serve users within the small - cells .",
    "in practice , users in deactivated small - cells also need to be served by macro - cells .",
    "thus , the different power consumption patterns for macro - cells and small - cells should be considered , and load balancing between them should be properly designed to reduce the total hetnet power consumption .",
    "though @xcite considered small - cells activation , it did not aim to minimize the total hetnet power consumption but mitigate interference .",
    "we summarize the key notations in this paper in table i.    1.5 mm    .key notations [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this subsection , to further show the performance of the proposed hetnet power saving scheme , we compare algorithm  [ algorithm_non_uniform ] with the following two benchmark schemes .",
    "one is without on / off operation adaptation for all sbss , and keep all sbss always active .",
    "the other is to independently keep all sbss active based on a probability @xmath3 .",
    "we set @xmath4 in the simulation .",
    "for all three schemes , we consider a case with dense small - cell deployment with @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] , we show the total hetnet power consumption across all sbss and the mbs , given in ( [ p_network ] ) , for all three schemes over a large range of macro - cell user density @xmath6 .",
    "for each of the three schemes , the mbs adopts the same power allocation method as that discussed in section ii - c to assure the macro - cell users qos . as has been discussed in section iii",
    "- a , if @xmath6 is too large , such that the mbs s maximum transmit power @xmath7 can not satisfy all macro - cell users qos , the system becomes infeasible . in this case , for all three schemes , we apply admission control to randomly reject a portion of users from accessing the hetnet such that the mbs s maximum transmit power is just sufficient to assure the qos of all the remaining users that are allowed to access the hetnet . we denote the macro - cell user density that makes the resulted mbs transmit power equal to @xmath7 for our proposed scheme , the scheme without sbs on / off , and the scheme with probability - based sbs on / off as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "it is first observed from fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] that the hetnet total power consumptions of all three schemes are non - decreasing over @xmath6 as expected .",
    "it is also observed that our proposed scheme always consumes much less power than the other two benchmark schemes when @xmath6 is not large , and gradually approaches to the scheme without sbs on / off as @xmath6 increases , where increasingly more active sbss are needed under our proposed scheme to support the increased users .",
    "when all sbss under our proposed scheme become active , our proposed scheme becomes the scheme without sbs on / off , and thus consumes the same power consumption .",
    "moreover , when @xmath11 , the system becomes infeasible for both proposed scheme and the scheme without sbs on / off . in this case , since the mbs keeps using the maximum transmit power @xmath7 and the sbss are always active , the hetnet total power consumption under both schemes becomes a constant , which is given by @xmath12w from ( [ p_network ] ) .",
    "similarly , when @xmath13 , the system also becomes infeasible under the probability - based scheme , where the hetnet total power consumption is given by @xmath14w , which is smaller than that under the proposed scheme since only @xmath15 of sbss are active .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath16 , our proposed scheme can properly support more users than the probability - based scheme .      in this subsection , we show the total power consumption of the mbs as well as that of all the sbss by applying algorithm 2 .",
    "the simulation parameters are set as the same as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : power ] , it is first observed that when @xmath6 is small , since all the users in the hetnet can be properly supported by the mbs , the sbss just remain inactive with a constant power consumption given by @xmath17w , while the mbs s power consumption increases over @xmath6 . as @xmath6 increases",
    ", the sbss begin to be turned on and thus their total power consumption begins to increase over @xmath6 .",
    "it is interesting to observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : power ] that when @xmath6 is between @xmath18\\times 10^{-3}$ ] , the mbs s power consumption becomes decreasing over @xmath6 , due to the efficient traffic offloading from the sbss that decreases the mbs s power consumption .",
    "however , when @xmath6 is sufficiently large with @xmath19 , such that the sbss power consumption for offloading mbs s traffic load can cause the overall hetnet power to increase , we observe that the mbs needs to increase its transmit power again to properly support the users for saving the total power consumption in the hetnet . at last ,",
    "similar to that in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] , when the traffic load in the hetnet is unexpectedly heavy , all the sbss become active and the mbs transmits with its maximum power . in this case , we observe that the total power consumption of the mbs is a constant , given by @xmath20w , and that of all the sbss is also a constant , given by @xmath21w .",
    "in this paper , by dynamically changing sbss operation modes , we studied the hetnet power minimization problem for both cases with uniformly and non - uniformly distributed users . for the case with uniformly distributed users ,",
    "the sbs s location - based operation algorithm was proposed and the optimal operation mode can be found by gradually deactivating sbss according to their individual distances to the mbs . for the case with non - uniformly distributed users ,",
    "both sbss different locations and small - cell user density were considered for their optimal operation mode decision .",
    "we showed that the optimal operation in this case is np - hard and then proposed a near - optimal algorithm with polynomial complexity . in the future work ,",
    "it is interesting to extend the current single - macro - cell scenario to the general multi - macro - cell scenario by further taking the interference from neighboring macro - cells into account .",
    "we first derive the inner expectation of @xmath22 $ ] of ( [ p_t_avg ] ) , for a given @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 , @xmath25 , denote whether the macro - cell user @xmath26 is located in the area @xmath27 , where @xmath28 if the event @xmath29 is true , and @xmath30 otherwise .",
    "since each user @xmath26 is independently distributed in the hetnet and uniformly distributed within each @xmath27 , it is easy to verify that @xmath31 . moreover , given that user @xmath26 is located in @xmath27 , we can easily obtain @xmath32=\\int_{a_n } \\frac{1}{\\|a_n\\| } { p_k^t(r , k)ds } $ ] since the user is uniformly distributed in @xmath27 . as a result , by considering all the possible events with user @xmath26 locating in @xmath27 , @xmath33 , we can write the inner expectation @xmath22 $ ] of ( [ p_t_avg ] ) as @xmath34&=\\sum_{n=0 , \\textrm{or~}n\\in \\mathcal{m},\\theta_n=0}\\mathtt{p}\\left(1_{\\{k\\in a_n\\}}=1\\right)\\mathtt{e}_{r_k}\\left [ p_k^t({r_k},k ) \\big| 1_{\\{k \\in a_n\\}}=1\\right]\\nonumber \\\\   & =   \\sum_{n=0 , \\textrm{or~}n\\in \\mathcal{m},\\theta_n=0 } \\frac{\\lambda_n \\|a_n\\|}{\\lambda_0\\|{a_0}\\| + \\sum_{\\ { m|{\\theta _ m } = 0\\ } } \\lambda_m \\|{a_m}\\| }   \\int_{a_n } \\frac{1}{\\|a_n\\| } { p_k^t(r , k)ds }   \\nonumber \\\\   & = \\frac{1}{{{\\lambda _ 0}||{a_0}|| + \\sum\\limits_{\\ { m|{\\theta _ m } = 0\\ } } { { \\lambda _ m}||{a_m}|| } } } \\cdot \\left({{\\lambda _ 0}\\int\\limits_{{a_0 } } { p_k^t(r_k , k)ds }   + \\sum\\limits_{\\ { m|{\\theta _ m } = 0\\ } } { { \\lambda _ m}\\int\\limits_{{a_m } } { p_k^t(r_k , k)ds } } } \\right ) .",

    "by using a similar method as that in appendix e , it is easy to verify the existence and uniqueness of @xmath123 and @xmath124 via bisection searching .",

    "it is then easy to verify that the hetnet s power consumption can be reduced by turning off the sbs @xmath61 .",

    "<S> traditional macro - cell networks are experiencing an upsurge of data traffic , and small - cells are deployed to help offload the traffic from macro - cells . given the massive deployment of small - cells in a macro - cell , the aggregate power consumption of small - cells ( though being low individually ) can be larger than that of the macro - cell . compared to the macro - cell base station ( mbs ) </S>",
    "<S> whose power consumption increases significantly with its traffic load , the power consumption of a small - cell base station ( sbs ) is relatively flat and independent of its load . to reduce the total power consumption of the heterogeneous networks ( hetnets ) , we dynamically change the operating states ( on and off ) of the sbss , while keeping the mbs on to avoid any service failure outside active small - cells . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider that the wireless users are uniformly distributed in the network , and propose an optimal location - based operation scheme by gradually turning off the sbss closer to the mbs . </S>",
    "<S> we then extend the operation problem to a more general case where users are non - uniformly distributed in the network . </S>",
    "<S> although this problem is np - hard , we propose a joint location and user density based operation scheme to achieve near - optimum ( with less than 1% performance loss in our simulations ) in polynomial time .    </S>",
