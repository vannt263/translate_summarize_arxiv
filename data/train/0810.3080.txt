    "non - leptonic kaon decay has been a focus for both theoretical and experimental physics for over 40 years since the discovery of cp violation by christenson , cronin , fitch and turlay  @xcite in @xmath3 . since then the origin of cp violation",
    "has long been a challenge to many theoretical models .",
    "the recent data from various experiments have yielded a clear non - vanishing direct cp - violation parameter  @xcite : @xmath4 which ruled out the so - called superweak theory where no direct cp violation appears in the decay  @xcite . at present , a full theoretic explanation to the origin of this phenomenon is still lacking . in the framework of the standard model ( sm )",
    ", direct cp violation can be generated by the non - zero phase in the quark flavor - mixing matrix ( ckm matrix ) , as was suggested by kobayashi and maskawa  @xcite .",
    "a precision calculation of the effect , however , is extremely hard due to the non - perturbative nature of the strong interactions at low energy .",
    "results from several groups utilizing different methods differ widely , with error bars much larger than that of the experimental result  @xcite .",
    "the unsatisfying situation of the theoretical calculations have attracted much interest in attributing part of the phenomenon to physics beyond sm .    to be able to pin down the contribution to @xmath2 from models containing new physics , one has to make precision calculations of the strong - interaction physics associated with the non - perturbative structure of kaons and pions .",
    "various methods have been used to calculate the hadronic matrix elements , such as lattice  @xcite , qcd - inspired models  @xcite , chiral expansion together with large-@xmath5",
    "@xcite , and parametrizations  @xcite . at present , the lattice field theory is the only approach based on first principles , with controllable systematic errors .",
    "there are difficulties in lattice calculations which are associated with the fact that the final state contains more than one particle . by maiani - testa theorem  @xcite , it is impossible to extract the physical kaon decay matrix elements by taking the limit @xmath6 in the euclidean space . in practise , there are several ways to avoid it : one can either work with an unphysical choice of momenta  @xcite , utilize an unphysical set of meson masses  @xcite , or derive the physical matrix elements by unphysical , but calculable ones .",
    "all of these methods need chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "chpt assumes an approximate chiral symmetry exists in @xmath7 and describes the low - energy qcd physics under a chiral breaking scale @xmath8 by the pseudo - goldstone particles , namely pions , kaons and eta . then the low - energy physics can be perturbatively expanded in powers of the particles external momenta and masses .",
    "it further assumes that , the wilson coefficients of the qcd operators expanded in terms of meson operators are independent of the external states .",
    "therefore the amplitudes of a large number of reactions can be determined by a relatively small set of coefficients , which gives us the predicting power . in the case of kaon decay",
    ", chpt is used to connect the desired matrix element @xmath9 with some unphysical quantities , such as @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the results in chpt are needed before doing relevant lattice calculations .",
    "here we will neglect some subtleties in the chpt ( such as quadratic divergence cancelations , zero pion mass corrections , etc ) and focus on possible operator structures as well as their chiral logarithm corrections for the kaon decay process .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to examine the chiral structures of possible qcd operators responsible for @xmath12 decay in generic beyong - sm theories and to calculate the large chiral logarithms associated with them .",
    "previous calculations have been made for operators present in the sm  @xcite .",
    "our work extends these studies to all possible operators in new physics models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start from the operator basis in sm for the kaon decay , as well as possible new operators coming from physics beyond sm .",
    "a chiral perturbation theory calculation will be presented in the following section , with all corresponding operators and their one - loop corrections of the matrix elements .",
    "we end this section by applying our result to a specific example .",
    "concluding remarks and outlook are presented in the last section .",
    "in this section , we consider effective qcd operators contributing to cp - violating @xmath1 decay in a generic weak - interaction theory .",
    "there is an extensive literature on this topic in the context of sm  @xcite .",
    "our focus is on new operators arising from novel cp - violating mechanisms beyond sm .",
    "we classify the effective operators in terms of their flavor symmetry properties under chiral group @xmath13 when up , down , and strange quarks are taken as light .",
    "the direct cp violation parameter @xmath2 for @xmath1 decay is defined as  @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the strong - interaction @xmath16 scattering phase shifts , and @xmath17 is the weak kaon decay amplitudes : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the effective weak - interaction hamiltonian which depends on the underlying theory of kaon decay .",
    "the small ratio @xmath20 reflects the well - known @xmath21 rule .",
    "accurate calculations of @xmath2 depend on reliable evaluations of the effective qcd operators present in @xmath22 .",
    "our goal in this paper is to classify these qcd operators and study their chiral behavior .",
    "the standard procedure for calculating @xmath2 utilizes an effective field theory approach .",
    "the physics at high energy ( or short distance ) can be calculated perturbatively and is included in wilson coefficients .",
    "the physics at low - energy scales is included in the effective qcd operators composed of light flavor quark fields ( @xmath23 ) and gluon fields .",
    "large qcd radiative corrections or large logarithms are resumed by solving renormalization group equations .",
    "the effective operators responsible for the neutral kaon decay have the flavor quantum numbers @xmath24 . in the sm , it is well - known that @xmath25 consists of following 10 operators  @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 with @xmath28 representing the left-(right- ) handed quark fields .",
    "the summation in @xmath29 is over the light - quark flavors ; @xmath23 ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 are color indices ; and @xmath32 is the algebraic charge factor for flavor @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath33 come from the single @xmath34-boson exchange tree diagram , and @xmath35 are derived from one - loop gluon and electro - weak penguin diagrams , respectively . in the sm , @xmath36 is dominated by the qcd penguin operators , whereas @xmath37 receives contribution from the electro - weak penguin operators only , because the gluon interaction is flavor - singlet and can not contribute in @xmath38 channel",
    ".    a chiral structure analysis of the above ten operators will be useful if we wish to use lattice qcd to calculate the relevant matrix elements in kaon decays .",
    "using @xmath39 to denote a representation of group @xmath40(3)@xmath41 @xmath42(3 ) , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the dimensions of su(3 ) representations , it is then easy to see that @xmath33 and @xmath45 belong to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 to @xmath46 , and @xmath49 to @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "chpt calculations have been made to uncover the large logarithms associated with these operators , which in turn help to establish relations of different matrix elements useful for lattice qcd calculations .",
    "for the reader s convenience , we have collected the standard chiral results in the appendix .",
    "the question is what is the general chiral structure of all possible weak operators that might emerge in theories beyond sm ?",
    "the rest of this section is devoted to addressing this question .",
    "let us systematically consider the possible operators and their chiral structures in a general low - energy description of kaon decay , independent of the underlying short - distance flavor physics that can be taken into account by wilson coefficients .",
    "the lowest dimensional operator is a dimension-5 chromo - magnetic operator , @xmath51 this operator does appear in the standard model through penguin diagram as shown in left - panel fig .",
    "1 , although it is proportional to the strange or down quark masses , which is chirally suppressed .",
    "it also appears naturally in the left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) with left - right handed gauge - boson mixing , proportional to charm or top quark masses  @xcite , as shown on the right panel in fig.1 . under chiral symmetry",
    ", this operator transforms as @xmath52 .",
    "the chiral logarithms appearing with the matrix elements of this operator has been studied before in the literature , and is collected in the appendix .",
    "next , consider dimension-6 four - quark operators .",
    "we define the following flavor tensor @xmath53 where the flavor indices @xmath54 go through 1 , 2 , and 3 , or up , down and strange quarks . @xmath55 and @xmath56 are possible dirac matrix structures . in addition , there are two independent color structures @xmath57 and @xmath58 which are not essential for the following discussion . assuming that all fields are projected to their helicity states , the possible helicities are as follows :    *   all four quark fields have the same chiral projection *   both @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( also @xmath31 and @xmath61 ) have the opposite chiral projection *   both @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( also @xmath31 and @xmath61 ) have the same chiral projection    these are only possibilities because the operators must be lorentz scalars , and the numbers of left and right - handed fields apart from the first case must be exactly 2 , respectively . in the first and second case , the operators are the ones appearing in the sm weak interactions , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ smop ] ) , and their parity partners .",
    "they correspond to chiral structures ( 8,1 ) , ( 1,8 ) , ( 27 , 1 ) , and ( 1,27 ) from the first case , and ( 8,1 ) , ( 1,8 ) and ( 8,8 ) from the second case .",
    "the new ( 1,8 ) and ( 1,27 ) structures will appear in , for example , lr symmetric models where the right - handed gauge boson plays the same role as left - handed one in the sm .",
    "since the strong interactions conserve parity , the new operators in lrsm have the same matrix elements as @xmath62 s in sm up to a parity sign .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams in both sm and lrsm for the first and second cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ wlwr ] .        in the last case ,",
    "there are new chiral structures arising from operators of type @xmath63 where two @xmath64 must be the same .",
    "the new chiral structures are @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and their parity conjugates .",
    "however , @xmath68 and @xmath69 involve symmetrization of two flavor indices and , at the same time , anti - symmetrization of the other two .",
    "it is easy to check that the result vanishes , and we are left with just @xmath65 and @xmath70 .",
    "let us consider the following tensor with up ( and hence lower ) indices symmetrized @xmath71 where the upper indices represents the left - handed fields and the lower indices the right - handed . without loss of generality , we take @xmath72 . if @xmath73 , and @xmath74 or @xmath61 is @xmath75 and the other indices must be a 2 , one get an isospin-1/2 operator @xmath76 if we define a tensor @xmath77 which multiplies the quark operator @xmath78 to generate the above operator , @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 and other components zero .    on the other hand ,",

    "the first is the chromomagnetic operators with an insertion of two additional derivatives , which does not change the original chiral structure .",
    "the second type is an insertion of one derivative into four - quark operators discussed above .",
    "since the covariant derivative has one lorentz index , it must be contracted with another lorentz index appearing on a dirac matrix .",
    "an example of this type of operators is @xmath87 which comes from the gluon and electromagnetic penguin diagram in lrsm as shown in fig .",
    "these operators contain either 3 left - handed fields and 1 right - handed one , or 3 right - handed fields and 1 left handed one .",

    "first , the quark - mass - dependent operators ( operators constructed with @xmath194 ) contribute in the physical process @xmath156 , in contrary to @xmath415 in the sm case .",
    "the reason is similar to that for the higher - order operators of ( 27,1 )  @xcite : they can not be expressed as a total divergence by the equations of motion .",
    "similarly , these new operators will not act as a generator for rotation in @xmath416 plane like the @xmath415 does  @xcite .",
    "therefore the one - loop matrix elements of @xmath271 will no longer be proportional to @xmath417 as they did at tree level .",
    "second , the masses appearing in our result are either bare masses or the renormalized one depending on the processes . for the unphysical processes @xmath418 and",
    "@xmath419 , we use the bare masses , whereas for the physical @xmath420 , the one - loop renormalized mass is implied .",
    "it makes the comparison to the experimental result feasible .",
    "third , in  @xcite the author claimed that infrared - sensitive terms like @xmath421 , which diverges in the @xmath422 limit , will emerge in the @xmath156 matrix element .",
    "we have checked the result by keeping pion masses explicit in our calculations , and found that all such terms canceled when summing all the diagrams .",
    "therefore it is safe to take the limit @xmath422 .    finally , there are a large number of unknown non - perturbative coefficients in the new operators . for dimension-6 operators , the traditional way of determining these coefficients by calculating simple processes like @xmath205 is suffice . in dimension-7 cases , however , the two simple processes @xmath423 and @xmath205 are not enough to determine all the coefficients , unless there is the so - called cps symmetry . adding",
    "other simple processes like @xmath424 and @xmath425 will not improve the situation since they are not independent in the @xmath426 limit we are working on .",
    "we can in principle get more relationships when away from @xmath426 chiral and isospin symmetries , but many more new coefficients will enter as well , and then we need even more relationships to determine all the coefficients .",
    "therefore we could either rely on some model - dependent assumptions or calculate more complicate processes on lattice directly . in any case",
    ", the chpt calculations can serve as a check for relations among coefficients from lattice or other non - perturbative model calculations .",
    "the standard model calculations for the direct cp violation in non - leptonic kaon decay have not been entirely settled due to large cancelations between different matrix elements .",
    "therefore , there is a considerable interest in understanding this phenomena from beyond standard model physics .",
    "however , we do not know yet what form the new physics will take , either supersymmetry , left - right symmetry , large extra dimensions , or little higgs , or something else .",
    "presumably , the large hadron collider will help us to identify it in the next few years .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to study a general effective theory for non - leptonic kaon decay which has its origin from beyond sm physics .",
    "we systematically classify the dimension-5 , 6 and 7 quark and gluon operators according to their chiral structures .",
    "using chiral symmetry , we derive tree - level relations between the matrix elements involving zero , one and two pions .",
    "this is useful because lattice calculations of multiparticle matrix elements are much harder than these for few particles .",
    "we have also calculated the leading chiral logarithmic behavior of these operators in chpt .",
