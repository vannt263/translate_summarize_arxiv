    "there are still serious reasons , in our opinion , to investigate bondi - type accretion models @xcite .",
    "firstly , they are still not yet fully explored in the general - relativistic context , despite a significant work that has been done in the last decades ( see @xcite and many of forthcoming references ) . secondly , and even more importantly , when put in the framework of cosmological spacetimes they can be thought of being simple toy models that shed light on the possible influence of the cosmological constant @xmath0 onto the formation of material structures .",
    "we obviously do not mean that these models can reproduce the arrangement of matter in , say , superclusters of galaxies ; we expect , however , that if the cosmological constant damps bondi accretion , then realistic models should reveal less robust structure formation .",
    "thirdly  and this essentially constitutes a reversal of the former argument  if accretion is @xmath0-dependent , then the natural question is to ask under what circumstances it is possible to estimate the value of the cosmological constant just by a quasilocal analysis ?    in a recent paper @xcite two of us investigated stationary , spherically symmetric accretion flows of self - gravitating polytropic fluids in cosmological spacetimes .",
    "the physical picture discussed in @xcite was as follows .",
    "we considered a spherical cloud of self - gravitating polytropic gas , accreting steadily on a central black hole . the outer areal radius of the cloud , its total mass and the mass of the black hole were fixed .",
    "we also fixed the parameters of the gas : the polytropic exponent and the local speed of sound at the outer boundary .",
    "the numerical data presented in @xcite suggested that the mass accretion rate of transonic solutions decreases with the increasing modulus of the cosmological constant , irrespective of its sign , provided that the mass of gas is kept constant .",
    "in this paper we investigate spherically symmetric , steady flows of test - gases , for polytropic and isothermal equations of state .",
    "the emerging picture turns out to be more complex than it could be inferred form the previous work . in particular , the relation between the accretion rate and the cosmological constant depends on the assumed details of the model .",
    "section ii of this paper specifies the de sitter and anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetimes and give equations that are relevant for the description of steady accretion .",
    "section iii shows the existence of `` homoclinic '' solutions , i.e. , solutions for which the graph of the square of the radial velocity versus the areal radius forms a closed loop joining the same critical point .",
    "this phenomenon happens only for polytropic equations of state and negative cosmological constant .",
    "a similar behavior was observed in approximate analysis of accretion models with low angular momentum @xcite . to our knowledge , it is the first time , where such solutions are obtained strictly and in spherical symmetry .",
    "section iv discusses transonic flows of isothermal fluids in the test gas limit .",
    "we find exact solutions and investigate the dependence of the mass accretion rate on @xmath0 . in most cases , when keeping fixed the asymptotic mass density , the mass accretion rate decreases with the increase of @xmath0 .",
    "the exception is the stiff equation of state @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the pressure and @xmath3 denotes the energy density .",
    "thence the baryonic mass accretion rate achieves a maximum at some @xmath4 .    in section v we consider accretion in suitably prepared",
    " swiss - cheese vacuolized @xcite  friedman  lemaitre  roberston  walker ( flrw ) models .",
    "accreting system are put in the interiors of the vacuoles , in a way that does keep the overall flrw geometry  that means that the total mass of vacuoles is fixed .",
    "then we study the dependence of accretion onto cosmological constant .",
    "it appears that polytropic and isothermal fluids behave differently .",
    "the accretion rate of polytropic fluids achieve a maximum at a negative value of @xmath0 .",
    "isothermal fluids accrete with efficiency that monotonically decreases with the increase of @xmath0 .",
    "the interesting feature of polytropic accretion flows is that the accretion stops completely when the _ absolute value _ of @xmath0 is large enough . in all isothermal and polytropic",
    "accretion flows we observe freezing when _ positive _ @xmath0 is large enough .",
    "this is yet another indication , in agreement with @xcite , that the cyclic universe scenario of penrose @xcite can not work .",

    "we will only deal with black holes satisfying @xmath53 .    for @xmath54",

    "these data specify a transonic solution uniquely , with the exception of possible bifurcations  see the discussion concerning `` homoclinic - type '' polytropic solutions ) .",
    "we demand also that the boundary values satisfy @xmath74 .    in the asymptotically flat fixed spacetime ( e.g. , in the schwarzschild spacetime ) ,",
    "one usually lets @xmath75 , so that @xmath71 and @xmath73 are asymptotic values .",
    "this defines a model that is mathematically elegant , but suffers from a physical contradiction  the self - gravity of an infinite mass of fluid is neglected .",
    "a solution is to keep @xmath70 large , but finite . in this case",
    "it is also possible to take into account the self - gravity of the fluid , as it was done in @xcite . in general , the assumption that the fluid region is finite is also necessary in schwarzschild(anti-)de sitter spacetimes .",
    "global solutions ( with @xmath76 ) exist for @xmath54 and isothermal equations of state .",
    "in the case of spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat systems with fluids one can define two sensible measures of mass .",
    "thus it is not surprising that the mass accretion rate appears in two forms @xcite .",
    "there is the quasilocal baryonic mass @xmath77 here @xmath78 is a 3-dimensional region of a @xmath39 hypersurface .",
    "this definition follows directly from the continuity equation ( [ za ] ) ; one has @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the integration element , normal to the boundary @xmath81 . for the line element ( [ aj ] )",
    "the baryonic mass comprised within an anulus @xmath82 can be expressed as @xmath83 it changes according to @xmath84 . here",
    "@xmath85 is the baryonic mass accretion rate .",

    "it holds for accreting systems discussed in this paper as well .",

    "this last formula has been obtained in @xcite for maximal hypersurfaces with @xmath95 of asymptotically flat geometries , but it is valid in any space - time slicing @xcite .",
    "it has been found earlier , for @xmath96 , that both @xmath97 and @xmath98 are constant on a fixed time slice ( @xmath99 @xcite ) . since they do not depend on time in the steady flow approximation , they are proportional , @xmath100 , with a constant @xmath101 that can be found from boundary conditions",

    "( [ ae ] ) and ( [ af ] ) that also for @xmath102 neither @xmath98 nor @xmath97 depends on @xmath16 . in the steady flow approximation we again have @xmath103 , but now the constant depends on the cosmological constant .    in the case of static systems",
    "the binding energy can be defined as the difference between the asymptotic and baryonic mass , @xmath104 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
