    "in the development of first principles electronic structure methods for extended systems , a huge amount of research effort is expended exploring different function spaces in which to expand the electronic wavefunctions .",
    "this is a critical design choice since the rate of convergence of the desired properties of the system with respect to the size of this function space will substantially impact the computational cost and feasibility of calculations , and go a long way to determining the utility of the approach . in this paper",
    ", we will consider a simple , robust protocol for building a periodic gaussian basis from an underlying traditional plane - wave expansion .",
    "in particular , we focus on the ability to converge the virtual manifold of states , required for correlated , post - mean - field calculations , such as the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , gw theory , mller - plesset theory ( mp2 ) , coupled - cluster theory , as well as multi - configurational strong correlation approaches@xcite .",
    "the computational cost of these methods grows between quadratically and exponentially with respect to the number of virtual states , and therefore the ability to span the relevant parts of this space with as few functions as possible becomes a critical design decision in the implementation of periodic correlated methods . from the perspective of the paradigmatic uniform electron gas , plane waves are the natural choice of basis to expand both one - electron and many - electron wavefunction quantities  @xcite",
    ". these plane waves are eigenfunctions of the kinetic energy operator , and naturally fulfil the periodicity of the computational cell . in realistic _",
    "ab initio _ calculations , these plane waves also have a number of appealing features .",
    "they are independent of the molecular makeup of the simulation cell , and instead only depend on the size and geometry of the cell .",
    "in addition , a single cutoff parameter dictating the upper energy scale of the included plane waves ( and hence the resolution of the resultant wavefunctions ) is used to systematically expand the plane wave basis to completeness , in a fashion free from basis - set superposition error ( bsse )  @xcite .    however , there are some drawbacks to plane wave expansions .",
    "since they make no reference to the nature of the atomic environment , they have equal basis coverage throughout the cell .",
    "this can lead to a great deal of wasted computational effort when studying defects , surfaces or lower - dimensional systems .",
    "this is due to the necessity for large amounts of vacuum in the cells to minimize the effect of spurious periodic images , which results in large , unwieldy plane wave expansions to converge relevant properties  @xcite . even in bulk systems ,",
    "the dominant electron density will generally be clustered around the atomic sites , and making use of this fact with atom - centered functions can certainly improve basis set convergence .",
    "for correlated methods , the steeper scaling compared to mean - field methods means that the speed of convergence with respect to number of basis functions is even more critical . rather than using plane waves directly for the virtual space , it is more common to truncate the prior mean - field virtual manifold on an energetic criteria to improve the convergence to the complete basis set@xcite .",
    "however , this virtual manifold is not inherently physical , and its somewhat arbitrary truncation therefore does not necessarily provide a good basis in which to expand the correlated wavefunction . truncating based on an energetic criteria ( now on the mean - field energy rather than kinetic energy as for plane waves ) does not necessarily yield fast convergence , while issues such as band - crossings which can occur as unit cells are distorted or enlarged can yield discontinuities in potential energy surfaces and equations of state .",
    "furthermore , consistent truncations of the virtual bandstructure when comparing fundamentally different systems , such as a defective and pristine lattice structure , are close to impossible to achieve , and therefore still generally rely on convergence to costly , near - complete basis sets for meaningful comparisons .",
    "attempts to truncate virtual single - particle orbital expansions using other criteria , such as occupation numbers from other levels of theory , have had some success , but can often be expensive to carry out  @xcite .",
    "an alternative representation to plane wave expansions are local atom - centered basis sets .",
    "this mirrors the duality between basis representations of lattice models such as the hubbard model , where the local ` site ' degrees of freedom contrast with that of the discrete @xmath0-space , plane wave representation , commonly used in the uniform electron gas .",
    "these local functions now correspond to a basis with a local , atomistic description of the simulation cell .",
    "futhermore , their use allows for simple extraction of local descriptors , such as atomic electron numbers , spin density or projected densities of states , without requiring post - processing localization steps towards wannier , or similar , functions  @xcite . while these local functions can take many forms , from muffin - tin orbitals  @xcite , to wavelets  @xcite or numerical atomic orbitals  @xcite , in this manuscript we consider the use of periodic gaussian basis sets , and analyse their convergence for correlated levels of theory .",
    "while gaussian basis sets can potentially take many different parameterizations , their widespread use within the field of quantum chemistry has meant that many tabulated basis sets of increasing size and flexibility are readily available  @xcite .",
    "the gaussian orbitals are optimized to approximate the natural orbitals of the free atom and its common ions , often at correlated levels of theory .",
    "orbitals beyond the core and valence shells are included to account for appropriate polarization and distortion of the atomic wavefunctions in bonding environments , and to provide a description of correlation effects .",
    "basis sets are commonly arranged in hierarchies so that they can be systematically expanded to allow for consistent and ( if necessary ) extrapolatable convergence . in periodic systems , as the atomic - like gaussian orbitals come together to form bands , they will split about the fermi level to describe the important low energy regions of the space , as well as retaining a consistent , local description of the one - electron wavefunctions , even for low - dimensional systems , or as cells change shape or atoms move .",
    "the use of gaussian - type orbitals in periodic electronic structure is not new to this work , with several other codes employing their use  @xcite .",
    "the local nature of these functions and ` nearsightedness ' of the interactions is often used for reduced scaling techniques , including in diagonalization steps , or construction of coulomb and exchange interactions in order to approach linear scaling mean - field treatments  @xcite , and can also be extended to local treatment of correlation  @xcite . furthermore",
    ", mixed plane - wave and gaussian schemes have also been previously introduced as an attempt to combine their strengths in the condensed phase @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that in post - mean - field correlated methods ( including those based around the explicitly screened coulomb interaction ) the ultimate rate determining scaling in the convergence of correlated properties with respect to the one - electron basis set size is the description of the short - range coulomb hole and non - analytic cusp condition at the coalescence point of two particles  @xcite . it has been shown that this scaling behaviour is the same for both gaussian , as well as plane wave expansions of the orbital space  @xcite .",
    "however , the absolute convergence in different basis sets can be very different , as the decay of the coulomb hole depends sensitively on the electron density , as well as the flexibility of the basis at the coalescence points .",
    "furthermore , the absolute one - electron basis set incompleteness ( which is both a feature of the correlated , as well as mean - field wavefunctions ) , is also very much dependent on the specifics of the primitive orbital expansion  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we detail an implementation of a straightforward approach for the use of a periodic gaussian basis ( or indeed any numerical atom - centered functions ) within a code set up for more traditional plane wave description of the wavefunction .",
    "we also consider changes to deal with core electrons when they are not explicitly considered , as is the case in the vasp code within the projector augmented wave ( paw ) framework where this work is implemented .",
    "we then apply correlated levels of theory to a number of systems , demonstrating that the consistent level of truncation as afforded by the gaussian basis set expansions leads to a rapidly convergent and extrapolatable virtual space for the calculations .",
    "extensive comparison is made to all - electron molecular calculations , giving confidence in the applicability of the functions for both strongly and weakly interacting systems .    for larger - scale applications ,",
    "we propose and explore an efficient hybrid approach . in this approach",
    ", the occupied orbitals are converged first within a large primitive plane wave expansion , rendering the occupied space and hence hartree  fock energy and its contributions to properties essentially complete . a virtual basis",
    "is then included for the correlation treatment comprised of the complementary set of orbitals constructed by projecting the occupied orbitals out of the gaussian basis set .",
    "this dual approach removes basis incompleteness of the occupied one - electron wavefunctions and properties and thus substantially ameliorates the issue of basis - set superposition error , which now only manifests through the subsequent correlation treatment .",
    "in addition , it retains the benefits of the compact , consistent virtual space afforded by the atom - centered gaussians .",
    "we note that related occupied projected gaussian bases ( projected atomic orbitals  @xcite ) have been used previously in gaussian basis codes to exploit the locality of correlation@xcite , however we do not rely on this locality here , beyond its manifestation in the general compactness of the full set of virtual orbitals , as discussed above .",
    "this is applied to the mp2 contributions to the cohesive energy of the neon solid , where the weak binding means that basis set incompleteness manifests as large relative errors .",
    "also studied is the absorption of a water molecule onto a lithium hydride crystal surface , where the low - dimensionality of the system means that the gaussian virtual space efficiently spans the correlated wavefunction , and allows for rapid convergence of extrapolations which agree well with reference results .",
    "this section outlines the procedures employed to transform a specified contracted gaussian basis set into one which can be used with a plane wave solid state code within the framework of the projector augmented wave method .",
    "this involves first ` pseudizing ' the sharply peaked core part of the basis , designed to capture the nuclear cusp within all - electron calculations , but which is unnecessary in this context . the resulting smoother function",
    "is then represented through its plane wave coefficients .",
    "figure  [ fig : scheme ] outlines the individual steps schematically .      the gaussian basis set is composed of atom - centered functions ( gtos ) that can be decomposed into a radial and angular parts such that an angular momentum function ( @xmath1 ) for a given atom positioned at @xmath2 can be given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a spherical harmonic and @xmath5 correspond to spherical coordinates .",
    "the radial function @xmath6 is expanded using gaussian functions such that @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a normalization constant of the gaussian primitives .",
    "@xmath9 are contraction coefficients for the primitive gaussian functions with exponent @xmath10 .",
    "the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method was introduced by blchl  @xcite .",
    "further details , as well as its close relationship with the ultrasoft pseudopotential method of vanderbilt , were shown by kresse and joubert in ref .  , while here we briefly recap the approach . in the paw method , the orbitals ( @xmath11 )",
    "are derived from the pseudo orbitals ( @xmath12 ) by means of a linear transformation @xmath13    the index @xmath14 , labeling the orbitals @xmath15 , is understood to be shorthand for the band index and the bloch wave vector @xmath16 , while the index @xmath17 is a shorthand for the atomic site @xmath18 , the angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and an additional index @xmath21 denoting the linearization energy .",
    "the wave vector is conventionally chosen to lie within the first brillouin zone .",
    "the pseudo orbitals are the variational quantities of the paw method and are expanded in reciprocal space using plane waves , @xmath22    the all - electron partial waves @xmath23 are the solution to the radial schrdinger equation for the non - spin - polarized reference atom at specific energies @xmath21 and specific angular momenta @xmath19 . the pseudo - partial waves @xmath24 , are equivalent to the all - electron partial waves outside a core radius @xmath25 and match continuously onto @xmath23 inside the core radius . the partial waves @xmath23 and @xmath24 are represented on radial logarithmic grids , multiplied with spherical harmonics .",
    "the projector functions @xmath26 are constructed in such a way that they are dual to the pseudo partial waves , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "the pseudized partial waves @xmath24 are obtained by pseudizing the all - electron partial waves @xmath23 for a given core radius @xmath25  @xcite .      in this work we seek to employ gaussian basis sets using a plane wave code .",
    "fourier components of strongly localized real space orbitals decay very slowly , which manifests as a slow convergence of the orbitals with respect to the underlying plane wave energy cutoff .",
    "this cutoff energy dictates the size of the plane wave basis employed in eq .",
    "[ eq : pw ] .",
    "the slow convergence of the orbitals with respect to this cutoff is mainly due to sharp features of the gaussian - type orbitals ( gtos ) resulting from the fitting of the non - analytic cusp behaviour at the nuclear coalescence point , which in non - relativistic quantum theory exhibits a derivative discontinuity in the wavefunction .",
    "however , the plane - wave basis we employ is augmented within the projector augmented wave framework , which includes a description of the atomic core region of each atom .",
    "this augmentation largely resolves these sharply varying parts of the wavefunction .    to this end",
    "we ` pseudize ' the gto functions defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : radgto ] , which smooths the core region of each function , defined up to a pseudization radius from the nucleus , @xmath25 .",
    "this is done in a way consistent with the symmetry and norm of the orbitals , and results in a more rapidly convergent set of fourier components representing pseudized gtos ( pgtos ) .",
    "the employed pseudization strategy mirrors the work of kresse _ et al _ in the construction of pseudized partial waves  @xcite for pseudopotentials .",
    "the core of the pseudized radial gaussian basis functions are expanded in three spherical bessel functions such that @xmath28 with @xmath29 chosen such that the value of the function , as well as logarithmic derivatives match at the cutoff radius , @xmath30 |_{r = r_c}=          \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } [ ln(r j_l(q_i r ) ) ] |_{r = r_c}.\\ ] ] moreover , we require norm conservation of the pgto such that @xmath31 we note that for @xmath32 the following condition holds @xmath33 .",
    "we choose the pseudization radius such that it is identical to the cutoff radius used by the projectors @xmath26 in the paw method . in this manner",
    "we ensure that that core region of the pseudized gaussians is augmented with additional terms that capture the oscillatory and sharp features of the one - electron wavefunctions in this region .",
    "once the appropriate fourier components are found , integrals between the orbitals can be obtained in the reciprocal basis as normal , with the gygi - baldereschi scheme used to correct for the divergence at @xmath34 of the coulomb kernel in reciprocal space@xcite .",

    "[ fig : fouriercom ] , where the convergence of the total and correlation energies of a @xmath36 cell of diamond is considered , demonstrating that pseudization of the atomic functions is essential to obtain rapidly convergent properties with the size of the underlying plane wave basis . while the size of this plane wave basis is generally insignificant when considering the cost of the correlated treatment in the system",
    ", numerical and computational difficulties can arise if the plane wave cutoff is too large , and therefore the pseudization is necessary when aiming to converge results for a given atomic basis set .",
    "we can also consider the convergence of static properties in a larger gaussian basis as the underlying plane wave basis which represents these functions increases , which will depend on the accuracy of relative energies across a range of cell geometries .",

    "this ensures that the full flexibility of the pseudized gaussian basis is spanned , _ in addition _ to the complete occupied space . since all orbitals are ultimately expressed by their fourier components , this projection is trivially achieved , and the virtual orbital space @xmath37 can be constructed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the gaussian basis , and @xmath40 represents the complete space of occupied orbitals expressed in the plane wave basis ( note that the @xmath41 orbitals which are projected out refer to the ` all - electron ' orbitals rather than the pseudized orbitals to ensure true orthogonality ) .",
    "if the norm of any virtual orbital is below a threshold value after this projection , then it is removed from the calculation , while the rest are orthonormalized and constitute the virtual basis for the calculation . the virtual space is subsequently canonicalized before use in post - mean - field methods , with no further mixing between occupied and virtual states possible .",
    "it is also possible for the ` occupied ' atomic orbitals of the original contracted gaussian basis to be identified and removed entirely from the basis , as they are largely redundant , to leave an overall basis the same size as the original , unmodified gaussian basis , but still complete in all mean - field orbitals and properties .",
    "the benefits of this basis construction are significant , with basis set incompleteness and superposition error only remaining in the correlated treatment of the wavefunction , which is readily extrapolatable within the employed correlation - consistent basis sets .",
    "a drawback of the above construction is that the occupied space is no longer represented within an underlying local basis , which may be desirable for the exploitation of locality approximations in quantum cluster methods . finding a local representation would then require further localization steps which would be unnecessary if the underlying basis was already local .",
    "the use of gaussian basis sets for local , cluster approximations will be explored in the future .",

    "this comparison demonstrates strongly how much more compact the pgtos basis for such systems can become compared to canonical hf orbitals . in a future study we will investigate this system in greater detail including methods that also go beyond mp2 theory , as correlations beyond this level are clearly important , as can be seen by comparison to the ccsd(t ) incremental results , and diffusion monte carlo .",
    "in this paper we have outlined a simple , black - box and robust approach to use local , atom - centered gaussian basis functions within a plane wave basis set using the projector augmented wave method and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the so - called pseudized gaussian basis set can be expanded efficiently in a plane wave basis set with a moderate kinetic energy cutoff .",
    "we have shown that a hybrid approach whereby the occupied orbitals are expanded in a plane wave basis set and only the virtual orbital manifold is expanded in the pseudized gaussian basis set orthogonalized to the occupied orbitals provides a compact and systematically improvable basis .",
    "the advantages of this over pure plane wave basis set calculations become most beneficial in correlated wavefunction based calculations of low dimensional systems and systems where weak interactions need to be described with high accuracy .",
    "this is not unexpected since the size of the plane wave basis set suffers from the fact that it grows linearly with the box size regardless of the position or number of atoms in the studied system . as a result",
    "it is difficult to devise systematic virtual orbital manifold truncation schemes for rapidly convergent energy differences .",
    "in contrast to plane waves , gaussian atom - centered basis sets take the local character of electronic correlation into account _ a priori _ and allow for a systematic description of electronic correlation effects such as the polarizability using a system tailored and compact basis set .",
    "of course , the introduction of such local basis sets also always bears the burden of several shortcomings such as basis set superposition errors ( bsse ) and linear dependencies of diffuse atom - centered basis functions in densely packed solids .",
    "these problems can partly be accounted for by counterpoise bsse corrections and removing linearly dependent basis functions .",
    "the compromise of a wavefunction expansion in gaussians for the virtual space and a plane wave expansion for the occupied space seems an efficient approach for combining the advantages and mitigating the disadvantages of each basis .",
    "we note that our method allows to easily switch between these two different basis sets ( local atom - centered gaussians and periodic plane wave ) , which could potentially lead to novel , transferable and more compact basis sets with the aim to reduce the computational cost of correlated wavefunction based theories in periodic systems even further . in the future , this infrastructure will be combined with other correlated methods , including coupled - cluster and f12 methods  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , methods which directly exploit the locality of correlation effects , including quantum cluster methods such as dynamical mean - field theory  @xcite and density matrix embedding theory  @xcite , as well as more traditional domain - based approaches to local correlation  @xcite can be used within this framework , and are being actively explored .",

    "<S> we present a simple , robust and black - box approach to the implementation and use of local , periodic , atom - centered gaussian basis functions within a plane wave code , in a computationally efficient manner . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure outlined is based on the representation of the gaussians within a finite bandwidth by their underlying plane wave coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the core region is handled within the projected augment wave framework , by pseudizing the gaussian functions within a cut - off radius around each nucleus , smoothing the functions so that they are faithfully represented by a plane wave basis with only moderate kinetic energy cutoff . to mitigate the effects of the basis set superposition error and incompleteness at the mean - field level introduced by the gaussian basis </S>",
    "<S> , we also propose a hybrid approach , whereby the complete occupied space is first converged within a large plane wave basis , and the gaussian basis used to construct a complementary virtual space for the application of correlated methods . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that these pseudized gaussians yield compact and systematically improvable spaces with an accuracy comparable to their non - pseudized gaussian counterparts . a key advantage of the described method is its ability to efficiently capture and describe electronic correlation effects of weakly bound and low - dimensional systems , where plane waves are not sufficiently compact or able to be truncated without unphysical artifacts . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the accuracy of the pseudized gaussians for the water dimer interaction , neon solid and water adsorption on a lih surface , at the level of second - order mller  </S>",
