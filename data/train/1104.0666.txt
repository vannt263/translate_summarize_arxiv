    "subluminous b ( sdb ) stars represent one of the least - understood stages of stellar evolution , yet they dominate surveys of faint blue objects and are found in almost all galactic stellar populations .",
    "they are the field counterparts of the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars in globular clusters and lie in a region of the h - r diagram corresponding to the location of models with he - burning cores and extremely thin h envelopes @xcite .",
    "understanding these stars better would illuminate the enigmatic ",
    "second parameter \" problem in globular cluster evolution , improve synthesis modeling of the uv upturn in giant elliptical galaxies , identify the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for guiding main sequence stars to this state , and constrain the physical properties of the dense plasmas present in these compact objects .",
    "presumably , the sdb stars have been stripped of almost all their surface hydrogen after the red giant phase , but how and why this stripping occurs is still debated .",
    "some have proposed binary models in which the extra angular momentum provided by a companion manages to expel almost all of the hydrogen envelope @xcite .",
    "others have proposed that more modest amounts of angular momentum , as might be resident in a planet , could accomplish the same effect @xcite .",
    "still , others are able to draw hot subdwarf stars from their models without the assistance of a companion @xcite .    in any case , companions may be profoundly important for understanding the evolution of sdb stars , and placing constraints on the nature of these systems may shed light on their evolutionary histories .",
    "several studies have shown an unusually high binary fraction amongst the hot subdwarf stars @xcite .",
    "measurements of radial velocity ( rv ) shifts have led to the orbital parameters of approximately 85 sdb binaries ( see table a.1 from @xcite ) .",
    "the periods of such systems range from 0.07 to 28 days , with a peak between 0.5 d & 1.0 d. rv variability studies are most sensitive to systems with shorter periods and higher total masses , and as a result , few system parameters exist for longer - period binaries . only two systems with periods above 10 days have well - determined orbital parameters ( pg 0850 + 170 & pg 1619 + 522 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the discovery of the first of the pulsating sdb ( sdbv stars have also been called v361 hya and ec 14026 stars , while the sdbv@xmath3 stars have the aliases pg 1716 , v1093 her , and betsy stars . ] ) stars @xcite in conjuction with the first sdbv star models @xcite opened the possibility of exploring their structure through a combination of spectral analysis and stellar seismology .",
    "multi - colour photometry and time - series spectroscopy techniques , for example , have revealed information about the total mass , envelope mass , and chemical stratification for a handful of pulsators ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the pulsations may also provide the opportunity to detect companions by using phase measurements to look for oscillations in the arrival times of the pulses .",
    "@xcite used this method successfully to detect a @xmath4 planet around the star v391 peg ( hs 2201 + 2610 ) .",
    "their study also resulted in the first published measurement of @xmath5 for a pulsating sdb star , constraining the evolutionary state of v391 peg .",
    "cs 1246 , a recently - discovered sdbv@xmath6 star @xcite , is a prime target for an extended o - c diagram study since it exhibits a single , large - amplitude pulsation mode . using the prompt telescope array , we monitored the pulse timings for 14 months by collecting nearly 400 hours of time - series photometry .",
    "the o - c diagram shows a sinusoidal oscillation superimposed on a parabola .",
    "we interpret the quadratic term as a secular decrease in the pulsation period , while the sinusoidal oscillation implies the presence of a low - mass stellar companion , probably an m - dwarf or white dwarf .",
    "our study marks the second time @xmath5 and the mass of a companion have been estimated for a hot subdwarf star using the o - c method .",
    "we began monitoring cs 1246 in 2009 using the 0.41-m panchromatic robotic optical monitoring and polarimetry telescopes ( prompt ) on cerro tololo to look for phase variations in the pulsations .",
    "the prompt operate under the control of a prioritised , queue - scheduling system called skynet and are 100% automated .",
    "priority levels are assigned to all observations in the queue , and , consequently , some of our photometry runs were interrupted by higher - priority targets such as gamma - ray bursts . for additional details on the prompt and skynet , we refer the reader to @xcite .        over the course of 14 months , we collected more than 33,000 individual frames representing 400 hours of time - series photometry .",
    "the majority of these data were taken in a four - month span between january and may 2010 with prompt 3 . on a typical night",
    ", we obtained at least three hours of photometry with 30-s exposures and no filter ; during these observations , our duty cycle was on average 83% .",
    "we also include in this work the photometry from 2009 presented in @xcite and a few light curves obtained with the goodman spectrograph @xcite on the 4.1-m soar telescope .",
    "appendix [ tab : phot_log ] presents a detailed log of our photometric observations .",
    "images were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded in iraf using standard procedures .",
    "we then extracted our photometry using antonio kanaan s external iraf package _",
    "ccd_hsp_. we chose aperture radii that maximized the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in the nightly light curves and used sky annuli to estimate and subtract off counts from the sky . as the field",
    "is densely packed with stars , we were careful to avoid contamination of the apertures and annuli from neighboring stars .",
    "we removed sky transparency variations by dividing our light curves by those of constant comparison stars .",
    "such stars were chosen by selecting from those in the field that were photometrically constant in time , not contaminated by nearby stars , substantially brighter than cs 1246 , and not saturated during a 30-s exposure . additionally , we avoided comparison stars that were likely to drift out of the frame during the prompt runs due to an approximately 0.4 arcmin hour@xmath7 tracking error in the mounts .",
    "these selection criteria provided us with three dependable comparison stars , as shown in the field image in figure [ fig : field ] .",
    "lastly , we fit and normalised the light curves with parabolas to remove residual atmospheric extinction effects .",
    "this process can remove real variations in the stellar flux on the order of the run lengths , making it difficult to detect lower - frequency _ g_-mode oscillations , if they exist .",
    "all time stamps were converted to a barycentric julian ephemeris date ( bjed ) using the wqed suite ( v2.0 ; @xcite ) , which employs the method of @xcite .",
    "we analysed our light curves with a combination of fourier analysis and least - squares fits of sine waves , using both _",
    "period04 _ @xcite and mpfit @xcite .",
    "initially , the period , phase , and amplitude were left as free parameters in the fits , but once we obtained a better determination of the period ( see  [ sec : o - c ] ) , we refit all of the data with the period fixed .",
    "figure [ fig : lc_sample ] shows a representative light curve from one of our photometry runs above its amplitude spectrum .",

    "figure [ fig : amplitudes ] presents this trend above its ft . we exclude the 2009 data from this plot since they were taken primarily through different passbands from the 2010 data and the measured amplitude of @xmath8 strongly depends on the observed wavelengths @xcite .",

    ", we analysed our complete data set using the o - c technique , as discussed in the section that follows .",
    "we began our construction of the o - c diagram by calculating a linear ephemeris for the times of maxima in the light curve ( @xmath10 ) of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a reference time of maximum , @xmath13 the pulsation period , and @xmath14 the cycle number measured from @xmath12 . since keeping track of @xmath14 correctly over an extended period of time",
    "requires an exceptionally accurate starting frequency , we used the period resulting from the least - squares fits to the combined 2010 light curve for @xmath13 .",
    "our observing run on 2010 mar 10 falls near the middle of this combined light curve , and , consequently , we employed the time of maximum determined from its least - squares fit for @xmath12 .",
    "the observed times of maxima ( @xmath15 ) were taken from the least - squares fits to the individual light curves , and their corresponding cycle numbers were computed using equation ( [ eqn : o - c_form ] ) .",

    "a sinusoidal oscillation dominates the overall structure .",

    "the presence of the sinusoid is even more apparent in the ft of the o - c diagram with the quadratic term removed , as shown in figure [ fig : o - c_ft ] . to quantify these structures",

    "the parabolic component of the fit indicates a secular decrease in the pulsational period on the order of 1 ms every 1.7 yrs .",

    "companions falling within the white region could be detected in our data set , with certain restrictions on their orbital inclination angle .",
    "for these calculations , we assume a mass of 0.47 m@xmath2 for cs 1246 .",
    "the two dashed lines mark the combinations of companion masses and separation distances leading to orbital periods equal to the longest ( right dashed line ) and shortest ( left dashed line ) periods detectable using our o - c data , as computed using kepler s third law .",
    "the solid line shows the combinations of masses and distances resulting in reflex motions equal to our detection limits in the fourier transform of the o - c diagram , under the assumption of an edge - on orbital plane .",
    "masses below this line induce reflex motion below our detection limits , regardless of their inclination angles .",
    "the star symbol marks the location of the companion we detected ( plotted using the minimum mass ) , and the two dotted horizontal lines show the boundaries between planet and brown dwarf masses ( lower dotted line ) and between brown dwarf and stellar masses ( upper dotted line ) . ]",
    "more statistics are needed to draw conclusions about the formation channels leading to sdb stars from the orbital parameters of binary systems .",
    "searches for radial velocity variations , as are being carried out by the muchfuss survey @xcite , should uncover a wide variety of sdb binary systems , although they are somewhat biased towards higher - mass systems with shorter orbital periods .",
    "pulsating sdb stars may also be used to find unseen companions using the o - c diagram , as shown in this work and by @xcite , and the exotime project @xcite is currently building up o - c diagrams for several sdbv stars to look for oscillations in the pulse timings .",
    "although both of these surveys will be effective at uncovering binary companions to sdb stars , their sampling rates differ significantly from the one presented in this study , and , consequently , they will not be sensitive to the same parameter space shown in figure [ fig : sin_i ] .",
    "our result provides an important link between the two aforementioned methods for detecting unseen companions since an observable radial velocity variation should accompany our fortnightly phase oscillation .",
    "the o - c diagram is a significant tool used to discover and characterize the nature of unseen companions , including extrasolar planets , but no corroborative rv variations have been measured to date .",
    "the o - c oscillation of cs 1246 implies a two - week velocity variation with a semi - amplitude well within the range of medium - to - high resolution spectrographs .",
    "consequently , we are planning follow - up observations to measure the rv variations .",
    "if the expected rv variation is observed , it will be the first independent confirmation that it is possible to detect stellar and planetary companions using the o - c technique and sdb pulsations as the clock .",
