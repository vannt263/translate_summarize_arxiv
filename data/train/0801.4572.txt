    "it is currently believed that virtually all stars form surrounded by a circumstellar disk , even if this disk is sometimes very short lived .",
    "this conclusion follows from simple conservation of angular momentum arguments and is supported by mounting evidence .",
    "this evidence ranges from the excess emission , extending from the near - ir ( strom et al .",
    "1989 ) to the sub - millimeter ( osterloh @xmath2 beckwith 1995 ) , that is observed in most young ( age @xmath0 1 myr ) pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars to direct _ hubble _ images of disks ( mccaughrean & odell 1996 ) seen as silhouettes in front of the orion nebula . also , even though there is not _",
    "direct _ evidence that planets actually grow from circumstellar material , it has become increasingly clear that they are in fact the birthplaces of planets since their masses , sizes , and compositions are consistent with the theoretical minimum - mass solar nebula ( hayashi 1981 ) .",
    "recently , the discovery of exo - planets orbiting nearby main sequence stars has confirmed that the formation of planets is a common process and not a rare phenomenon exclusive to our solar system .",
    "thus , any theory of planet formation should be robust enough to account for the high incidence of planets and can not rely on special conditions or on unlikely processes to convert circumstellar dust and gas into planets .    star and planet formation are intimately related .",
    "standard low - mass star formation models ( e.g. shu et al .",
    "1987 ) describe the free fall collapse of a slowly rotating molecular cloud core followed by the development of a hydrostatic proto - star surrounded by an envelope and a disk of material supported by its residual angular momentum .",
    "this early phase is expected to occur on a timescale of about @xmath3 years ( beckwith 1999 ) and results in an optically revealed classical t tauri star ( ctts , low - mass pms star that shows clear evidence for accretion of circumstellar material ) .",
    "this stage is characterized by intense accretion onto the star , strong winds , and bipolar outflows .",
    "as the system evolves , presumably into a weak - lined t tauri star ( wtts , pms star mostly coeval with cttss but that do not show evidence for accretion ) , accretion ends , and the dust settles into the mid - plane of the disk where the solid particles are believed to stick together and to grow into planetesimals as they collide . once the objects reach the kilometer scale , gravity increases the collision cross - section of the most massive planetesimals , and runaway accretion occurs ( lissauer 1993 ) . in the standard core accretion model ( e.g. , pollack et al .",
    "1996 ) , massive enough proto - planets still embedded in the disk can accrete the remaining gas and become giant planets .",
    "the early stages are the most uncertain , and many people suspect that grains will not grow into planetesimals by collisions alone at the rate necessary to go through all stages of giant planet formation before the gas nebula has dissipated . also , even assuming that grains can grow into macroscopic bodies at the necessary rate , it is still doubtful whether they can form large planetesimals .",
    "once objects reach the meter - size scale , they are expected to rapidly spiral inward due to the dynamical interactions with the gas in the disk , which rotates at a slightly sub - keplerian velocity because it is supported against gravity by pressure in addition to the centrifugal force .    however , since current statistics of extra - solar planets indicate that giant planets are common , the difficulties of the standard core accretion model have led some researchers ( e.g. , boss 2000 ) to revisit an alternative planet formation mechanism that had been put aside for several decades , namely , gravitational instability . in the gravitational instability scenario ,",
    "giant planets form through the direct gravitational collapse of a massive unstable disk over timescales @xmath0 10@xmath4 yrs . in some hybrid models ( e.g. , youdin @xmath2 shu 2002 ) , solid particles settle to the mid - plane of the circumstellar disk and form a dense gravitationally unstable sub - disk . in this manner , planetesimals form from the gravitational collapse of the material in the mid - plane .",
    "the collision of planetesimals leads to runaway accretion , and the process continues in a way analogous to the core accretion model .",
    "thus , while the existence of planets around a significant fraction of all the stars is considered verified , the precise mechanisms through which planets form still remain largely unknown .",
    "so far , none of the proposed theories have proven satisfactory .",
    "on one hand , the standard model of continuous accretion of solid particles relies on doubtful sticking properties of rocks and on unknown processes to prevent the migration of meter - size objects .",
    "on the other hand , gravitational instability relies on unproven mechanisms to enhance the surface density of the disk s mid - plane to trigger the process of planet formation .",
    "clearly , more observational constraints are necessary to help the theoretical work on planet formation to proceed forward .",
    "until the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) becomes operational in the next decade , direct detection of forming planets will remain beyond our capabilities , but circumstellar disks are easier to detect and study because the surface area of a planetary mass dispersed into small grains is _ many _ orders of magnitude greater than the surface area of a planet .",
    "for this reason , much of the information about the properties of disks such as size , mass , density , and evolution timescales has been obtained by observing the thermal emission of the dust gains .",
    "these particles absorb and re - radiate the light mostly in the 1 @xmath5 m - 1 mm range .",
    "since the temperature of the disk decreases with the distance from the central star , different wavelengths probe different disk radii .",
    "one of the most important quantities on disk evolution is the lifetime of the disk itself , not only because it establishes the relevant timescale of the physical processes controling disk evolution , but also because it sets a limit for the time available for planet formation . in what follows ,",
    "i review the constraints on the dissipation timescale of different regions of the disk obtained from different surveys , performed at wavelengths ranging from the near - ir to the sub - millimeter .      since there is an almost 1 to 1 correlation between the presence of near - ir excess ( 1 - 5 @xmath5 m ) and the occurrence of spectroscopic signatures of accretion ( hartigan et al . 1995 ) , it is possible to investigate the lifetime of inner accretion disks ( r @xmath0 0.05 - 0.1 au ) by studying the fraction of stars with near - ir excess as a function of stellar age .",
    "early studies of nearby star - forming regions ( e.g. , strom et al .",
    "1989 ) found that 60 - 80@xmath6 of the stars younger than 1 myr present measurable near - ir excesses , and that just 0 - 10@xmath6 of the stars older than 10 myr do so .",
    "it has been argued that individual star - forming regions lack the intrinsic age spread necessary to investigate disk lifetimes from individually derived ages ( hartmann 2001 ) .",
    "however , similar disk studies , based on the disk frequency in clusters with different mean ages and extending to the 3.4 @xmath5 m l - band ( haisch et al . 2001 , hillenbrand 2006 ) , have led to results similar to those presented by previous groups .",
    "it is now well established that the frequency of inner accretion disks steadily decreases from @xmath01 to 10 myr .",
    "this decrease is illustrated in figure 1 for a sample of over 3500 pms stars in nearby clusters and associations .",
    "the disk fractions are consistent with _",
    "mean _ disk lifetimes on the order of 2 - 3 myr and a wide dispersion : some objects lose their inner disk at a very early age , even before they become optically revealed and can be placed in the hr diagram , while other objects retain their accretion disks for up to 10 myr .",
    "disk lifetime studies based on near - ir excesses always left room for the possibility that stars without near - ir excess had enough material to form planets at larger radii not probed by near - ir wavelengths .",
    "the iras and iso observatories had the appropriate wavelength range to probe the planet - forming regions of the disk ( r @xmath70.05 - 20 au ) but lacked the sensitivity needed to detect all but the strongest mid- and far - ir excesses in low - mass stars at the distances of nearest star - forming regions .",
    "_ spitzer _ provides , for the first time , the wavelength coverage and the sensitivity needed to detect very small amounts of dust in the planet - forming regions of a statistically significant number of low - mass pms stars .",
    "results ( e.g. , padgett et al .",
    "2006 ; silverstone et al .",
    "2006 ; cieza el al .",
    "2007 ) have shown that pms stars lacking near - ir excess are also very likely to show 24 @xmath5 m fluxes consistent with bare stellar photospheres and that optically thick primordial disks are virtually non - existent beyond an age of 10 myr .",
    "cieza et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also find that over 50@xmath6 of the wtts younger than @xmath71 - 2 myr show no evidence for a disk , suggesting that the inner @xmath710 au of a significant fraction of all pms stars becomes extremely depleted of dust ( mass @xmath0 @xmath8 m@xmath9 ) by that early age .",
    "recent sub - millimeter results extend the conclusions on the survival time of the material in the inner disk ( r @xmath0 0.1 au ) and the planet - forming region of the disk ( r @xmath7 0.520 au ) to the outer disk ( r @xmath750 - 100 au ) .",
    "andrews @xmath2 williams ( 2005 , 2007 ) study over 170 young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the taurus and ophiuchus molecular clouds and find that @xmath0 10@xmath6 of the objects lacking inner disk signatures are detected at sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "given the mass sensitivity of their survey ( m@xmath10 @xmath7 @xmath11@xmath1210@xmath13 m@xmath1 ) , they conclude that the dust in the inner and the outer disk dissipates nearly simultaneously .      taken together , the results of the surveys from the near - ir to the sub - millimeter imply that a sizable fraction of all pms stars lose their disks completely before the star reaches an age of @xmath71 myr , while some cttss maintain a healthy accretion disk for up to @xmath710 myr , which seems to be the upper limit for the survivability of primordial disks",
    "the reason why , within the same molecular cloud or stellar cluster , some primordial disks survive over 10 times longer than others is still unknown .",
    "the spread in disk lifetimes is likely to be related to the wide range of initial conditions , the planet formation process , and/or the effect of unseen companions .    since recent core accretion models ( e.g. , alibert et al .",
    "2004 ) can accommodate planet formation within 10 myr , the disk survivability limit alone can not distinguish between the competing planet formation mechanisms , core accretion and gravitational instability . on one hand , it is possible that planets form through core accretion around the few ctts disks that manage to survive for @xmath75 - 10 mys .",
    "on the other hand , it is also possible that the youngest wttss _ without _ a disk are objects that have already formed planets through gravitational instability .",
    "thus , establishing the incidence of planets around `` young wttss '' and `` old cttss '' could provide a crucial observational discriminant between the core accretion and the gravitational instability models .",
    "this goal is is one of the central objectives of the `` young stars and planets '' key project of the space interferometry mission ( beichman et al .",
    "2002 ) , a mission for which launch has unfortunately been deferred indefinitely at the time of writing .",
    "the fact that very few objects lacking near - ir excess show mid - ir or sub - millimeter excess emission implies that , once accretion stops , the entire disk dissipates very rapidly .",
    "based on the relative numbers of these objects , the transition / dissipation timescale is estimated to be @xmath0 0.5 myr ( skrutskie et al . 1990 ; wolk @xmath2 walter 1996 ; cieza et al . 2007 ) . from the observational point of view , this short transition timescale means that the vast majority of pms stars in any given population are either accreting cttss with excess emission extending all the way from the near - ir to the sub - millimeter or bare stellar photospheres .",
    "this also means that any t tauri star whose sed does not look like a typical ctts or a bare stellar phothosphere can be broadly characterized as a `` transition object '' .",
    "it should be noted , however , that precise definitions of what constitutes a transition object found in the disk evolution literature are far from homogeneous .    since there is a very strong correlation between accretion and the presence of near - ir excess ( hartigan et al .",
    "1995 ) , wtts very rarely show near - ir excess ; therefore , any wtts that do show ir excesses at longer wavelengths is a transition disk according to the broad definition stated above .",
    "padgett et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and cieza et al .",
    "( 2007 ) show that the few wtts that do have a disk present a wide diversity of sed morphologies and disk to stellar luminosity ratios that bridge the gap observed between the ctts and the debris disk regime .",
    "the ratio of the disk luminosity to the stellar luminosity , @xmath14 , is a measurement of the fraction of the star s radiation that is intercepted and re - emitted by the disk plus any accretion luminosity .",
    "this quantity is intimately related to the evolutionary status of a circumstellar disk . on the one hand ,",
    "the primordial , gas rich , disks around cttss have typical @xmath14 values @xmath15@xmath6 , mostly because they have optically thick disks that intercept @xmath710 - 20@xmath6 of the stellar radiation . on the other hand , gas poor debris disks have optically thin disks that intercept a much smaller fraction of the star s light and thus have @xmath16/@xmath17 values that range from @xmath18 to @xmath19 ( beichman et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the fact that wttss have @xmath14 values intermediate between those of cttss and debris disks suggests that they are an evolutionary link between these two well studied stages .",
    "these rare wtts disks are key for our understanding of disk evolution because they seem to trace the dissipation process as it rapidly occurs across the entire disk .",
    "the wide range of sed morphologies seen in wtts disks suggests that the disk dissipation process does not follow the same path for every star .",
    "the diversity of sed morphologies of wtts disks is quantified in figure 2 , which shows the slope of the ir excess , @xmath20@xmath21 , against the wavelength at which the ir becomes signicant , @xmath22@xmath23 .",
    "objects in the top right of the figure are wtts that have lost their short wavelength excess while keeping strong excesses at longer wavelengths .",
    "the seds of these objects are consistent with the formation of an inner hole in their disks ( calvet et al . 2002 , 2005 ) .",
    "this possible `` inner hole opening '' path is illustrated by the seds of the objects shown in the top row of figure 3 .",
    "objects in the bottom right of figure 2 are wtts in which the ir excess seems to have decreased simultaneously at every wavelength .",
    "these objects are more consistent with an evolution dominated by grain growth and dust settling .",
    "as the grains grow and settle into the mid - plane of the disk , the flared disk becomes flatter and hence intercepts a smaller fraction of the stellar radiation . as a result ,",
    "a smaller excess is expected at every mid - ir wavelength ( dullemond @xmath2 dominik 2004 ) .",
    "this possible `` dust settling '' path is illustrated by the seds shown in the bottom row of figure 3 .",
    "it is important to note that while most cttss occupy a very restricted region of the @xmath20@xmath21 vs. @xmath22@xmath23 diagram , some cttss do show transition seds similar to those of wtts disks .",
    "the best known examples of such cttss include tw hydra ( calvet et al .",
    "2002 ) , dm tau , and gm aur ( calvet et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these systems likely represent yet another path for disk dissipation , a path in which the inner regions of the disk become depleted of dust while gas is still accreting onto the star .    the standard yso evolutionary class proposed by lada ( 1987 ) and extended by greene et al .",
    "( 1994 ) is based on the slope , @xmath20 , of the sed between 2 and 25 @xmath5 m .",
    "however , this classification scheme can only capture a single evolutionary path in which @xmath20 decreases monotonically as young stellar objects evolve from class i into class ii , and then into class iii objects .",
    "the mid - ir data points from _ spitzer _",
    "s camera irac ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath5 m ) sample the seds of ysos at intermediate wavelengths between 2 and 25 @xmath24 and reveal that transition objects present a much larger diversity of sed morphologies than what can be described by the @xmath20 classification .",
    "the @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 classification seems more appropriate when abundant mid - ir broad - band photometry is available , but it still does not uncover the full range of sed shapes presented by transition objects .    _",
    "spitzer _ s infrared spectrograph ( irs ) , which allows us to sample the sed of ysos at hundreds of wavelengths between 5 and 38 @xmath5 m , has recently revealed a new family of transitions objects whose seds show a distinctive `` dip '' around @xmath710 - 20 @xmath5 m ( brown et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the seds of these objects can be modeled as disks having wide gaps with small inner radii ( 0.2 - 0.8 au ) and large outer radii ( 15 - 50 au ) .",
    "the presence of small ir excess shortward of 10 @xmath5 m in these objects requires the presence of small amounts of dust ( m @xmath7 10@xmath25@xmath26 ) in the inner disk , unlike objects such as coku tau/4 ( dalessio et al . 2005 ) and dm tau ( calvet et al . 2005 ) , whose inner holes seem to be completely depleted of dust .",
    "since the family of disks with seds suggestive of gaps contains both accreting objects ( e.g. , lkh@xmath20 330 and hd 135344 ) and not accreting objects ( sr 21 and t cha ) , it significantly expands the diversity of transition disks .",
    "the processes that drive disk evolution and the different pathways that disks follow as they evolve from optically thick primordial disks to optically thin debris disks are critical for our understanding of planet formation .",
    "these processes include accretion onto the star , photo - evaporation , dust settling and coagulation , and dynamical interactions with forming planets . in what follows ,",
    "i review the main processes believed to control the evolution of circumstellar disks around low - mass stars .",
    "to first order , the evolution of primordial disks is driven by viscous accretion .",
    "circumstellar material can only be accreted onto the star if it loses angular momentum .",
    "conservation of angular momentum implies that , while most of the mass in the disk moves inward , some material should move outward , increasing the size of the initial disk .",
    "the source of the viscosity required for disk accretion and the mechanism by which angular momentum is transported remain a matter of intense debate . as a result ,",
    "most viscous evolution models describe viscosity , @xmath27 , using the @xmath20 parameterization introduced by shakura @xmath2 sunyaev ( 1973 ) , according to which @xmath27 = @xmath20@xmath28@xmath29 , where @xmath28 is the pressure scale height of the disk and @xmath29 is the isothermal sound speed .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 hides the uncertainties associated with the source of the viscosity and is often estimated to be of the order of 0.01 .",
    "viscous evolution models ( hartmann et al . 1998 ; hueso @xmath2 guillot 2005 ) are broadly consistent with the observational constraints for disk masses , disk sizes , and accretion rates as a function of time ; however , they also predict a smooth , power - law , evolution of the disk properties .",
    "this smooth disk evolution is inconsistent with the very rapid disk dissipation ( @xmath30 @xmath0 0.5 myr ) that usually occurs after a much longer disk lifetime .",
    "pure viscous evolution models also fail to explain the variety of seds observed in transition objects dicussed above",
    ". these important limitations of the viscous evolution models suggest that they are in fact just a first - order approximation of a much more complex process .",
    "recent disk evolution models , known as `` uv - switch '' models , combine viscous evolution with photo - evaporation by the central star ( clarke et al . 2001 ; alexander et al . 2006 ) and are able to account for both the disk lifetimes of several million years and the short disk dissipation timescales ( @xmath30 @xmath0 0.5 myr ) . according to these models , extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) photons originating in the accretion shock close to the stellar surface ionize and heat the circumstellar hydrogen to @xmath710@xmath31 k. beyond some critical radius , the thermal energy of the ionized hydrogen exceeds",
    "its escape velocity and the material is lost in the form of a wind .    at early stages in the evolution of the disk ,",
    "the accretion rate dominates over the evaporating rate and the disk undergoes standard viscous evolution : material from the inner disk is accreted onto the star , while the outer disk behaves as a reservoir that resupplies the inner disk , spreading as angular momentum is transported outwards .",
    "later on , as the accretion rate drops to the photo - evaporation rate , the outer disk is no longer able to resupply the inner disk with material . at this point ,",
    "the inner disk drains on a viscous timescale and an inner hole is formed in the disk .",
    "once this inner hole has formed , the euv radiation very efficiently photo - evaporates the inner edge of the disk and the disk rapidly dissipates from the inside out .",
    "thus , the uv - switch model naturally accounts for the lifetimes and dissipation timescales of disks as well as for seds of some pms stars suggesting the presence of large inner holes .",
    "photo - evaporation , however , is not the only mechanism that has been proposed to explain the large opacity holes of some circumstellar disks .",
    "dynamical interactions with planets and even grain growth can deplete the inner disk of small grains and result in seds virtually indistinguishable from those expected for photo - evaporating disks .      since theoretical models of the dynamical interactions of forming planets with the disk ( lin @xmath2 papaloizous 1979 , artymowicz @xmath2 lubow 1994 ) predict the formation of inner holes and gaps , planet formation quickly became one of the most exciting explanations proposed for the inner holes of transition disks ( calvet et al . 2002 ; dalessio et al . 2005 ) . using a combination of hydrodynamical simulations and monte carlo radiative trasport , rice et al . (",
    "2003 ) model the broad - band sed of the transition disk around the ctts gm aur .",
    "they argue that the @xmath74 au inner hole they infer for the disk could be produced by a @xmath72 m@xmath32 mass planet orbiting at 2.5 au .",
    "modeling of the _ spitzer_-irs data of gm aur places the inner wall of the hole significantly farther away from the star , at 24 au ( calvet et al . 2005 ) ; nevertheless , the planetary origin of the gap still remains one of the favored hypotheses ( najita et al .",
    "2007 ) .    similarly , hydrodynamic simulations ( quillen et al .",
    "2005 ) suggest that the 10 au hole inferred for the disk around the wtts coku tau/4 ( figure 4 , left panel ) could be produced by the presence of a @xmath70.1 m@xmath32 mass planet orbiting very close to the edge of the hole s wall ( figure 4 , right panel ) .",
    "however , the very low accretion rate and the low disk mass render the disk around coku tau/4 one of the prime candidates for ongoing photo - evaporation ( najita et al .",
    "2007 ) .    given the extreme youth of some of the transition objects that have disks with inner holes ( age @xmath7 1 myr ) , the confirmation of the planetary origin of these holes would place very strong constraints on the time required for the formation of giant planets . in the not too distant future",
    ", alma will provide the sensitivity and angular resolution necessary to image the putative planets responsible for the observed holes ( narayanan et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "even though the formation of a giant planet can account for the inner holes of some transitional disks , the planet formation process is not required to be far along in order to produce a similar effect in the sed of a circumstellar disk .",
    "in fact , once primordial sub - micron dust grains grow into somewhat larger bodies ( r @xmath33 @xmath22 ) , most of the solid mass never interacts with the radiation , and the opacity function , @xmath34 ( @xmath35/gr ) , decreases dramatically .",
    "dullemond @xmath2 dominik ( 2005 ) model the settling and coagulation of dust in disks and investigate their effect on the resulting seds .",
    "they find that grain growth is a strong function of radius , it is more efficient in the inner regions where the surface density is higher and the dynamical timescales are shorter , and hence can produce opacity holes . as a result , grain growth ,",
    "the very first stage of planet formation , can in principle mimic the effect of a fully grown giant planet on the sed of a yso .",
    "dullemond @xmath2 dominik ( 2005 ) also find that , in their models , grain growth is _ too efficient _ to be consistent with the observed persistence of ir excess over a timescale of a few myrs .",
    "they conclude that small grains need to be replenished by fragmentation and that the size distribution of solid particles in a disk is likely to be the result of a complicated interplay between coagulation and fragmentation . as such ,",
    "the overall importance of the dust coagulation process on the evolution of seds is still not well understood .",
    "the formation of an opacity hole , due to grain growth or the presence of a planet , can have not only a dramatic effect on the appearance of the sed of a transition object , but also on disk evolution itself .",
    "chiang @xmath2 murray ( 2007 ) recently propose that , once an opacity hole of the order of 1 - 10 au is formed in a disk , the inner rim of the disk will be rapidly drained from the inside out due to the onset of the magneto rotational instability ( mri ) .",
    "the mri is one of the mechanisms that has been historically proposed to explain the accretion process in circumstellar disks .",
    "nevertheless , it is believed that the gas in cttss is usually too cold and too weakly ionized for the mri to be efficient ( hartman et al .",
    "typical ctts disks are too dusty for the stellar x - rays to penetrate deep enough into the disk to ionize material to the level required by the mri .",
    "chiang @xmath2 murray ( 2007 ) argue that an opacity hole in a disk produces the right conditions for the mri to be activated and sustained .",
    "according to their models , the wider the rim , the larger the mass of the mri - active region of the disk and the higher the accretion rate .",
    "therefore , once the mri is activated , the entire inner disk is rapidly evacuated , while the outer disk is photo - evaporated by uv radiation .      to date",
    ", most disk evolution models have treated each one of the processes discussed above independently of each other . in reality , it is clear that all these processes are likely to operate simultaneously and interact with one another .",
    "hence , the relative importance of these processes for the overall evolution of disks still remains to be established .",
    "the diversity of seds morphologies discussed in section 3 strongly suggests that disk evolution can follow different paths , each one of which is likely to be dominated by one or more different physical processes .    in order to investigate the relative incidence of different evolutionary paths , najita et al .",
    "( 2007 ) compare the observed accretion rates and disks masses of transition objects , which they define as objects with weak or no excess shortward of 10 @xmath5 m and strong excess at longer wavelengths , against the values expected for several disk evolution models .",
    "they find that transition disks occupy a restricted region of the accretion rate vs. disk mass plane .",
    "in particular , they find that transition objects tend to have significantly lower accretion rates , for a given disk mass , than non - transition objects and also tend to have larger median disk masses than regular t tauri disks .",
    "najita et al .",
    "( 2007 ) argue that most of the objects in their sample have properties consistent with a scenario in which a jovian mass planet has created a gap that isolates the inner disk from a still massive outer disk ( lubow @xmath2 dangelo 2006 ; varniere et al .",
    "2006 ) and suppresses accretion onto the star .",
    "they also argue that a minority of their objects have both small accretion rates and small disk masses that make them more consistent with the photo - evaporation model .",
    "finally , they propose that the lack of transition objects with large accretion rates and large disk masses implies that grain growth and the formation of planetesimals in the inner disk is an unlikely explanation for the opacity holes of transition disks . while very provocative , the results of najita et al . ( 2007 ) are based on sample of only 12 transition objects .",
    "fortunately , _ spitzer _",
    "is likely to increase the number of known transition disks by an order of magnitude by the end of its mission .",
    "follow - up observations of these objects , required to obtain accretion rates and disk masses , will soon allow to extend the study of najita et al .",
    "( 2007 ) to a much larger sample .",
    "the many transition disks discovered by _ spitzer _ are likely to be the subjects of many follow - up observations and studies for years to come . these are objects that are undergoing rapid transformations and have properties that place them somewhere in between two much better defined evolutionary states : those of regular cttss and debris disks .",
    "understanding the physical processes responsible for the diversity of transition disks and its implications for planet formation will be one of main challenges for the field .",
    "another key outstanding disk evolution issue is the question of when the transition from the primordial to the debris disk stage actually occurs .",
    "as mentioned in section 3 , some of the wtts disks have very small fractional luminosities and thus seem to be optically thin .",
    "these objects _ could _ be younger analogs of the @xmath36 pic and au mic debris disks , and thus some of the youngest debris disks ever observed .",
    "however , this interpretation depends on the assumption that these young wtts disks are gas poor .",
    "it is also possible that some of the wtts disks have very low fractional disk luminosities as a result of most of their grains growing to sizes @xmath3310 - 20 @xmath5 m , in which case they would still be primordial disks . since a real debris disks requires the presence of second generation of dust produced by the collision of much larger objects , the ages of the youngest debris disks can constrain the time it takes for a disk to form planetesimals .",
    "it has even been proposed that detectable second generation dust is not produced until pluto - sized objects form and trigger a collision cascade ( dominik @xmath2 decin , 2003 ) . in that case",
    ", the presence of debris disks around @xmath71 - 3 myrs old stars would have even stronger implications for planet formation theories .",
    "the fact that , as discussed in section 3 , the incidence of 24 @xmath5 m excesses around low - mass pms stars with ages @xmath710 myr is @xmath70 @xmath6 , is consistent with the idea that a quiescent period exists between the dissipation / coagulation of the primordial dust and the onset of the debris phenomenon .",
    "however , the confirmation of such a scenario will require far - ir observations sensitive enough to detect , at the distance of the nearest star - forming regions ( 150 - 200 pc ) , debris disks as faint as those observed in the solar neighborhood ( 10 - 30 pc ) .",
    "in the near future , _ herschel _ will provide such sensitivity .",
    "it will also provide the information on the gas content and grain size distribution of optically thin disks around wtts required to establish whether they represent the end of the primordial disk phase or the beginning of the debris disk stage .    even though much still remains to be learned about planet formation from the study of circumstellar disks ,",
    "ultimately , we would like to be able to directly observe planets as they form .",
    "alma could achieve this milestone in the next decade .",
    "with its most extended baseline , alma will have a resolution of 0.007@xmath37 at 625 ghz .",
    "this corresponds to an angular resolution of less than 1 au at the distance of nearby star forming regions like ophiuchus and taurus .",
    "narayanan et al . ( 2006 ) model the molecular emission line from a gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disk ( figure 5 , left panel ) and conclude that forming giant planets could be directly imageable using dense gas tracers such as hco+ ( figure 5 , right panel ) .",
    "such observations could provide the ultimate tests needed to distinguish among the competing theories of planet formation .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa through the _ spitzer _",
    "fellowship program under an award from caltech .",
    "i would like to thank trent dupuy , jonathan swift , and michael liu for their helpful suggestions ."
