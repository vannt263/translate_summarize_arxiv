    "the study of superfluidity and superconductivity in two - dimensional ( 2d ) fermi systems has attracted great attention in the past several decades , partly because of its close relationship to the problem of high-@xmath0 superconductors  @xcite .",
    "recently , the experimental progress on creating quasi - low - dimensional atomic gases in optical lattices  @xcite and on atom chips  @xcite provides us a possibility of realizing and studying superfluidity in a more controllable platform . in particular , with the aid of tuning an external magnetic field through a feshbach resonance , the interaction between fermionic atoms can be tuned continuously from the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) limit to the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) limit , so that the bcs - bec crossover can be studied  @xcite .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover in a 2d fermi system has been discussed at both zero  @xcite and finite temperatures  @xcite , where an effective 2d hamiltonian with atom - atom interaction ( called model 1 ) is employed . however , for strongly interacting fermionic atoms in a realistic quasi-2d geometry , due to the inevitable population of many excited levels along the strongly confined transverse direction  @xcite , one needs to introduce a composite particle called dressed molecule to account for the population in these transverse excited levels , and write down a more complicated form for the effective 2d hamiltonian ( called model 2 ) with renormalized interaction between atoms ( in the transverse ground level ) and dressed molecules  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the model 1 and the model 2 hamiltonians lead to qualitatively distinct results in some cases  @xcite .",
    "for instance , for quasi-2d fermions in a weak global harmonic trap , the model 1 hamiltonian predicts a constant value of the thomas - fermi cloud size at zero temperature from the bcs to the bec limit .",
    "in contrast , the model 2 hamiltonian predicts that the cloud size shrinks as one approaches the bec limit  @xcite , which is the correct trend as one should expect from the bcs - bec crossover picture .    in this paper , we extend the discussion of the model 2 hamiltonian to finite temperatures by taking into account the fluctuation effects .",
    "in particular , we consider a trapped quasi-2d fermi gas and study the superfluid transition temperature across a wide range of feshbach resonance .",
    "note that according to the mermin - wagner - hohenberg - coleman theorem  @xcite , phase fluctuations are dramatic at any finite temperatures such that there will be no ordinary long - range order in two dimensions . in this case , the superfluid transition is not accompanied by a bose condensation , but instead characterized by a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type , for which the vortex - antivortex pairs start to form at the transition and a topological order is established  @xcite . using the model 2 hamiltonian",
    ", we show that in a uniform quasi-2d fermi gas , the bkt transition temperature @xmath1 increases from zero at the bcs limit and approaches monotonically to almost a constant value about @xmath2 at the bec limit , where @xmath3 is the 2d fermi energy .",
    "furthermore , we take into account the weak harmonic trap in the radial plane , and investigate the number and superfluid density distributions under the local density approximation ( lda ) . as a characteristic feature of a bkt transition ,",
    "a finite jump of superfluid density is present in the middle of the trap , which takes a universal value of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "a quasi-2d fermi gas is typically prepared in experiments by means of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) deep optical lattice along the axial ( @xmath5 ) direction , where tunneling between different lattice sites is completely suppressed .",
    "a 1d lattice is described by the potential @xmath6\\cos ( k_{z}z)$ ] , where @xmath7 is the wave vector of the laser beam , and @xmath8 is the waist width satisfying @xmath9 .",
    "this optical lattice potential can be approximated around the minimal points by a strongly anisotropic pancake - shaped harmonic potential with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the radial distance .",
    "the strong anisotropy of the trap ( @xmath14 ) introduces two well separated energy scales , which allows us to first deal with the axial degrees of freedom by deriving an effective 2d hamiltonian , while the radial degrees of freedom are left for later treatment with the lda  approximation .",
    "the effective 2d hamiltonian describing a quasi-2d fermi gas within a strongly axial confinement is derived in ref .  @xcite . under natural units ( @xmath15 ) ,",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the annihilation operators for fermionic atoms and bosonic dressed molecules , respectively .",
