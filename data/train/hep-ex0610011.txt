    "only 10 @xmath2 resonances were discovered from 1974 to 1977 ; none were discovered from 1978 to 2002 . however from 2002 to 2005 , seven new @xmath2 resonances were discovered by belle , babar , cleoc , cdf , and d0 .",
    "i will review the @xmath1 and below , where there has been much progress from bes , cleoc , b - factories , etc .",
    "brian petersen will cover the new states : x , y , z , etc .",
    "prior to 2002 , there was an unconfirmed candidate for the @xmath3 by the crystal ball experiment  @xcite at a mass of 3594 @xmath4 5 mev / c@xmath5 . in 2002 , belle observed clear peaks in the @xmath6 mass distribution in @xmath7 at the @xmath8 , the @xmath9 , and at a mass of 3654 @xmath4 10 mev / c@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "cleo  @xcite and babar  @xcite quickly confirmed the higher mass value in @xmath10 with mass measurements of 3642 mev/@xmath11 and 3633 mev/@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "belle also found a peak in @xmath12 at @xmath13 mev/@xmath11  @xcite    combining the results , excluding crystal ball , yields a mass of @xmath14 = 3637 @xmath4 4 mev@xmath15 , and hyperfine splittings of @xmath16 mev/@xmath11 and @xmath17 mev/@xmath11 .",
    "the higher mass is more consistent with lattice calculations ( lqcd ) and potential models  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 or @xmath19 state has @xmath20 .",
    "this state is important to learn more about the hyperfine ( spin - spin ) interaction of p wave states .",
    "it is expected to have a mass near the center of gravity of the @xmath21 states @xmath22mev/@xmath11 , to be narrow ( @xmath23 mev/@xmath11 ) , and to decay to @xmath24 .    in 1992 , e760 using 16 pb@xmath25 of @xmath26 data observed a structure near 3526 mev/@xmath11 in @xmath27  @xcite . the successor experiment e835 using 113 pb@xmath25 of data was unable to confirm this peak !",
    "however e835 also searched for @xmath28 and found a signal at @xmath29 mev/@xmath11 for @xmath30 to 1 mev/@xmath11  @xcite .",
    "cleoc quickly substantiated this with evidence for @xmath31 production from @xmath32 at cesr  @xcite with a sample of @xmath33 @xmath34 events . using an inclusive analysis where they measured the mass recoiling from the @xmath35",
    ", they obtained @xmath36 mev/@xmath11 . from an exclusive analysis ,",
    "where they measured @xmath31 decays to @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , they obtained @xmath43 mev/@xmath11 .",
    "the consistency between the two measurements was good giving an overall @xmath44 mev/@xmath11 , and a product branching fraction @xmath45 , in agreement with a pqcd prediction of @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "the mass splitting @xmath47 @xmath48mev/@xmath11 agrees with expectations ( @xmath490 ) , but the sign and difference are not yet well enough determined to provide a real test .",
    "now the charmonium family below the @xmath1 is complete , and the mass values can be used in potential models to predict masses of higher states .",
    "cleoc with its csi calorimeter ( @xmath50 % at 100 mev ) allows a good measurement of the inclusive @xmath51 spectrum . using @xmath52 @xmath34 events , they measured @xmath53 ( e1 transitions ) and @xmath54 ( m1 transition )  @xcite .",
    "results are shown in table  [ table1 ] .",

    "these samples not only allow precision charm decay measurements , they also better our understanding of the @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1 is thought to be a mixture of @xmath96 and @xmath97 wave ( mostly @xmath97 ) , but since the @xmath1 is above dd - bar threshold it is expected to decay mostly to @xmath95 .",
