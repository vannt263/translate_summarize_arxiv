    "the handling of various languages and approaches for describing groups of automorphisms of spherically homogeneous rooted trees brought many significant results .",
    "for example , the algebraic language of the so - called tableaux with truncated polynomials over finite fields , introduced by l.  kaloujnine  @xcite , turned out to be effective in studying these groups as iterated wreath products .",
    "v.  i.  sushchanskyy  @xcite uses this language to construct the pioneering examples of infinite periodic 2-generated @xmath2-groups ( @xmath3 ) as well as to produce factorable subgroups of wreath products of groups  @xcite .",
    "a.  v.  rozhkov  @xcite , by using the notion of the cortage and studying the so - called aleshin type groups , first gave an example of a 2-generated periodic group containing elements of all possible finite orders ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "a.  ershler  @xcite uses a combinatorial language of a time - varying automaton to discover new results concerning the growth and the so - called f@xmath4lner functions of groups .    in the present paper , by introducing the notion of a self - similar automaton over a changing alphabet and the group generated by such an automaton , we make an attempt to show that the concept of a self - similar group with its faithful action by automorphisms on a homogeneous rooted tree ( also called a regular rooted tree ) can be naturally extended to an arbitrary spherically homogeneous rooted tree . as we show in theorem  [ t1 ] , our combinatorial approach allows to characterize the class of finitely generated residually finite groups",
    ". we also provide ( theorem  [ t2 ] ) naturally - defined representations for a large class of lamplighter groups for which the realization by the standard notion of a mealy type automaton is not known .",
    "self - similar groups appear in many branches of mathematics , including operators algebra , dynamical systems , automata theory , combinatorics , ergodic theory , fractals , and others . the most interesting and beautiful examples of self - similar actions are defined on the tree @xmath5 of finite words over a finite alphabet @xmath6 by using the notion of a transducer ( also called a mealy automaton ) , which , by definition , is a finite set @xmath7 together with the transition function @xmath8 and an output function @xmath9 .",
    "the convenient way defining and presenting a mealy automaton is to draw its diagram .",
    "for example , the diagram in figure  [ f1 ] determines a mealy automaton over the alphabet @xmath10 , with five states @xmath11 , with a transition function given by the oriented edges and with an output function given by labelling of the vertices by the maps @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the identity map and @xmath14 is a transposition : @xmath15 .",
    "we easily verify from this diagram the following equalities defining the transition and output functions of this automaton : @xmath16    each state @xmath17 of a mealy automaton @xmath18 defines a transformation of the tree @xmath5 .",
    "namely , given a word @xmath19 the automaton @xmath20 acts on the first letter @xmath21 by the map which labels the vertex corresponding to the state @xmath22 in the diagram of @xmath20 , changes its state to the state given by the end of the arrow going out of @xmath22 and labelled by @xmath21 ; being in a new state the automaton reads the next letter @xmath23 , transforms it and moves to the next state according to the above rule ; and continues in this way to transform the remaining letters of the word .",
    "the induced transformation of the set @xmath5 preserves the empty word and the beginnings of words and , if @xmath20 is invertible ( i.e. all the maps labelling vertices in the diagram of @xmath20 are permutations of the alphabet @xmath6 ) , it defines an automorphism of the tree @xmath5 .",
    "the group generated by automorphisms corresponding to all states of an invertible automaton @xmath20 with the composition of mappings as a product is called the group generated by this automaton . according to  @xcite ( definition  1.1 , p. 129 ) an abstract group @xmath24 is called self - similar over an alphabet @xmath6 if there is a mealy automaton @xmath18 which generates a group isomorphic with @xmath24 . for instance",
    ", the group @xmath24 generated by the automaton depicted in figure  [ f1 ] is a fameous grigorchuk group constituting one of the most interesting example among groups generated by all the states of a mealy automaton and , as it turned out , in the whole group theory .",
    "this is also the first nontrivial example of a self - similar group .",
    "groups generated by the states of a mealy automaton form a remarkable class of groups containing various important examples connected to many interesting topics . for more about mealy automata , groups generated by them , self - similar groups and for many open problems around these concepts see the survey paper  @xcite or  @xcite .      a time - varying automaton , which is a natural generalization of a mealy type automaton , allows to work not only with a fixed finite alphabet @xmath6 but also with an infinite sequence @xmath25 of such alphabets , which further will be called a changing alphabet .",
    "we say that the changing alphabet @xmath6 is unbounded if the sequence of cardinalities @xmath26 ( the so - called branching index of @xmath6 ) is unbounded .    by definition ,",
    "a time - varying automaton over a changing alphabet @xmath27 is a quadruple @xmath28 where @xmath7 is a finite set of states , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are sequences of , respectively , transition functions and output functions of the form @xmath31 the automaton @xmath20 is called invertible if @xmath32 is an invertible mapping of the set @xmath33 for all @xmath34 and @xmath17 . for every @xmath35",
    "we also define the _ @xmath36-th shift _ of the automaton @xmath20 that is a time - varying automaton @xmath37 where @xmath38 in particular , @xmath20 is a mealy automaton if and only if @xmath39 for every @xmath35 .    at first , in the literature of time - varying automata only the notion of an automaton over a fixed alphabet was considered and merely the structural properties of such automata were studied ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we first define in  @xcite the class of time - varying automata over a changing alphabet @xmath40 ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "such an alphabet defines a tree @xmath5 of finite words , which is an example of a spherically homogeneous rooted tree .",
    "the tree @xmath5 is homogeneous if and only if the branching index of @xmath6 is constant .",
    "moreover , any locally finite spherically homogeneous rooted tree @xmath41 is isomorphic with @xmath5 for a suitable changing alphabet @xmath27 .",
    "we introduced in  @xcite the notion of a group generated by an automaton over a changing alphabet and show that this combinatorial language is apt to define and study groups of automorphisms of spherically homogeneous rooted trees which may be not homogeneous . specifically ,",
    "if @xmath18 is an invertible time - varying automaton over a changing alphabet @xmath27 , then for every @xmath35 and each state @xmath17 we define , via transition and output functions , an automorphism @xmath42 of the tree @xmath43 and call the group @xmath44 as a _ group generated by the @xmath36-th shift of @xmath20_.    an invertible time - varying automaton @xmath18 is called _ self - similar _ if for every @xmath45 the mapping @xmath46 ( @xmath17 ) induces an isomorphism @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath18 is a mealy automaton , then we have @xmath48 for all @xmath35 and @xmath17 .",
    "thus every mealy automaton is self - similar by the above definition .",
    "an abstract group @xmath24 is called a _ self - similar group over the changing alphabet @xmath27 _ if there is a self - similar automaton @xmath18 which generates a group isomorphic with @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath49 .    every self - similar group @xmath24 over a changing alphabet @xmath6 is an example of a finitely generated residually finite group ( a group is called residually finite if there is a descending chain @xmath50 of normal subgroups of finite indexes and the trivial intersection ) .",
    "indeed , the group @xmath51 of all automorphisms of the tree @xmath5 is an example of a residually finite group ( stabilizers of consecutive levels of this tree are normal subgroups of finite indexes which intersect trivially ) .",
    "thus @xmath24 , as a group isomorphic with a subgroup of @xmath51 , is residually finite .",
    "given an abstract group @xmath24 and a changing alphabet @xmath27 , it is natural to ask about the _ automaton complexity of the group @xmath24 over the alphabet @xmath6 _ ,",
    "i.e. about the minimal number of states in an automaton over @xmath6 which generates a group isomorphic with @xmath24 . obviously , for any changing alphabet @xmath6 the automaton complexity of any group @xmath24 over @xmath6 is not smaller than the rank @xmath52 of this group , i.e. than the minimal cardinality of a generating set of @xmath24 .",
    "if the number of states in an automaton @xmath18 coincides with the rank of the group @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 , then the automaton @xmath20 is called _",
    "optimal_.      in the theory of groups generated by mealy automata the problem of classifying all groups generated by automata over a given alphabet @xmath6 and with a given number of states is essential and intensively studied .",
    "for example , by the result from  @xcite there are only six groups ( up to isomorphism ) generated by 2-state mealy automata over the binary alphabet , including the simplest example of an interesting group generated by a mealy automaton , that is the lamplighter group @xmath55 , where @xmath56 denotes a cyclic group of order 2 and @xmath57 is the infinite cyclic group .",
    ", width=238 ]    much effort put towards a classification of groups generated by 3-state mealy automata over the binary alphabet . in the paper  @xcite was shown , among other things , that there are no more than @xmath58 pairwise nonisomorphic groups defined by such automata .",
    "only recently it was discovered that a free - nonabelian group of finite rank is self - similar .",
    "namely , m.  vorobets and ya .",
    "vorobets showed in  @xcite that a mealy automaton ( the so - called aleshin type automaton ) depicted in figure  [ f2 ] generates a free group of rank 3 .",
    "moreover , it is still an open question whether or not there exists an optimal mealy automaton which generates a free group of rank 2 . referring to this problem",
    ", we provided  @xcite for this group an explicit and naturally defined realization by an optimal automaton over a changing alphabet ; see also example  [ ex2 ] .",
    "the first result of the present paper shows that the situation completely changes if we try to characterize all self - similar groups over an arbitrary unbounded changing alphabet .",
    "namely , we show the following    [ t1 ] every finitely generated residually finite group @xmath24 is self - similar over any unbounded changing alphabet and the corresponding self - similar automaton is optimal .",
    "as we will see in the proof , the construction leading to theorem  [ t1 ] is based on the specific type of automaton which we call an automaton of a diagonal type .",
    "we say that a time - varying automaton @xmath18 is of _ a diagonal type _ , or that @xmath20 has transition functions defined in the _ diagonal way _",
    "if @xmath59 for all @xmath34 , @xmath17 and @xmath60 .",
    "note that the proof of theorem  [ t1 ] is unconstructive and we can not explicitly define the output functions of the corresponding self - similar automaton for a given group @xmath24 and a changing alphabet @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , in that proof we choose for the construction of an automaton @xmath20 which generates the group @xmath24 an arbitrary generating set @xmath61 as a set of states and we define the transition functions in the diagonal way .",
    "next , we show that the output functions of @xmath20 can be induced by some embedding @xmath62 of the group @xmath24 into the infinite cartesian product @xmath63 of symmetric groups on sets of letters ; due to this embedding we define the output functions as follows : @xmath64 for all @xmath34 , @xmath65 and @xmath60 .",
    "however , the above embedding arises simply from the fact that @xmath24 embeds into the cartesian product @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is an infinite normal series with finite quotients @xmath68 ( @xmath34 ) and the trivial intersection .",
    "but the existence of such a normal series is equivalent to the assumption that @xmath24 is residually finite .",
    "hence , given a residually finite group @xmath24 , this method does not tell us how to compute effectively the permutations @xmath69 .",
    "in particular , we know nothing about the cycle structure of these permutations . moreover , in the case of a free group of rank  2 we tried to find in the paper  @xcite an explicit representation by an optimal automaton of a diagonal type . however , our computations led to a pretty complicated description of the mappings @xmath70 and , consequently , of output functions in such an automaton .    in view of the above disadvantages as well as the previous results , it would be interesting to find and study explicit and naturally defined representations of a given group @xmath24 by self - similar automata over a changing alphabet , especially if such representations are unknown by using the notion of a mealy automaton .",
    "let @xmath1 be an arbitrary nontrivial finitely generated ( finite or infinite ) abelian group . by definition ,",
    "the lamplighter group @xmath0 is a semidirect product @xmath71 with the action of the infinite cyclic group on the direct sum @xmath72 by a shift .",
    "for the rank @xmath73 of this group we have : @xmath74 .",
    "in recent years groups of this form are intensively studied via their self - similar actions .",
    "for example , the automaton realization of the lamplighter group @xmath75 from the paper  @xcite was used by r.  grigorchuk and a.  @xmath76uk to compute the spectral measure associated on random walks on this group , which leads to a counterexample to the strong atiyach conjecture  @xcite .",
    "this construction was generalized  @xcite by p.  silva and b.  steinberg in the concept of a reset mealy automaton , where for every finite abelian group @xmath1 the corresponding lamplighter group was realized as a group generated by a mealy automaton in which the set of states and the alphabet coincides with @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the only known optimal realization of the group @xmath0 by an automaton concerns the simplest case @xmath77 . here",
    ", it should also be mentioned that the question whether or not there exists a representation of a lamplighter group @xmath0 with an infinite @xmath1 by a mealy automaton is still open .    for the second result of this paper",
    "we come from a naturally defined and self - similar automaton @xmath78 of a diagonal type over a changing alphabet @xmath6 that generates the direct product @xmath79 ( see example  [ ex0 ] ) .",
    "we discover that only by a simple manoeuvre on each transition function in @xmath78 we can pass to a new automaton @xmath80 and obtain in this way a self - similar optimal automaton realization for the lamplighter group @xmath0 .",
    "namely , we distinguish the state @xmath81 in the automaton @xmath78 and the letters @xmath82 ( @xmath34 ) for each state @xmath83 and we define @xmath80 as an automaton which operates like @xmath78 , unless being in a state @xmath83 it receives the letter @xmath84 in a moment @xmath34 , then it moves to the state  @xmath81 .    to define the changing alphabet @xmath40 and output functions in the automaton @xmath78 we decompose the group @xmath1 into a direct product of cyclic groups @xmath85 such that @xmath86 .",
    "let us denote @xmath87 .",
    "for every @xmath34 we consider arbitrary @xmath88 pairwise disjoint cycles @xmath89 in the symmetric group on a finite set @xmath33 which satisfy the following conditions : for each @xmath90 the cycles @xmath91 ( @xmath34 ) do not have a uniformly bounded length , as well as the cycles @xmath92 ( @xmath34 ) for each @xmath93 , and the length of each cycle @xmath94 ( @xmath95 , @xmath34 ) does not depend on @xmath96 and is equal to @xmath97 .",
    "in particular , we see that the arising changing alphabet @xmath40 is unbounded .",
    "now , taking @xmath98 symbols @xmath99 different from @xmath81 , we define the automaton @xmath78 as an automaton of a diagonal type over the changing alphabet @xmath40 , with the set of states @xmath100 and the output functions defined as follows : @xmath101 for all @xmath34 , @xmath17 and @xmath60 , where the permutations @xmath102 , @xmath103 are defined in the following way @xmath104 as we mention above , passing to the automaton @xmath80 just needs to redefine transition functions of @xmath78 .",
    "explicitly , we define : @xmath105 , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 is a letter from the cycle @xmath91 .",
    "our main result is the following    [ t2 ] the automaton @xmath80 is self - similar and the group @xmath108 is isomorphic with the lamplighter group @xmath0 .    in the proof of theorem  [ t2 ]",
    "we do not use the algebraic language of embedding into wreath products of groups ( the so - called wreath recursion ) , which is common in studying self - similar groups . instead of this , for any @xmath34 we directly provide some recursive formulae describing the action on the tree @xmath109 of automaton transformations @xmath110 , where @xmath111 we show ( proposition  [ prop1 ] and lemma  [ lem1 ] ) that for every @xmath112 any two transformations @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) commute and the mapping @xmath116 induces an isomorphism between the group @xmath117 and the group @xmath1 , where the elements @xmath118 ( @xmath90 ) form the standard generating set of @xmath1 , that is @xmath119 , where @xmath120 occurs in the @xmath121-th position and represents a generator of the corresponding cyclic factor of @xmath1 .",
    "next , for each @xmath122 we consider the conjugation @xmath123 as well as the group @xmath124 generated by all these conjugations , and we show ( proposition  [ prop2 ] ) that @xmath125 is a direct sum of its subgroups @xmath126 , @xmath122 , which gives the isomorphism @xmath127 .",
    "further , we show ( lemma  [ lem5 ] ) that the group @xmath125 intersects trivially with the cyclic group generated by @xmath128 and that this cyclic group acts on @xmath125 by conjugation via the shift ( lemma  [ lem4 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the group @xmath129 is a semidirect product of the subgroups @xmath125 and @xmath130 , and , consequently , that @xmath131 is isomorphic with the lamplighter group @xmath0 via the mapping @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath90 , where @xmath134 is the standard generating set of @xmath0 , that is @xmath135 is a generator of @xmath57 in the product @xmath136 and @xmath137 where each @xmath138 on the right hand side occurs in zero position .",
    "finally , we obtain that the group @xmath139 generated by the @xmath96-th shift of the automaton @xmath80 is isomorphic with @xmath131 and the mapping @xmath132 , @xmath140 induces the isomorphism @xmath141 .    as we will see in the proof , all calculations verifying the above propositions and lemmas are entirely elementary .",
    "however , they are burdened with some technical formulae and the presentation of the proof seems to be quite formalistic .",
    "this contrasts with a transparent and intuitive idea behind the definition of the automaton @xmath80 . on the other hand ,",
    "our construction confirms one of the most intriguing phenomenon in the computational group theory which originates from dealing with the simplest examples of transducers , i.e. although they can generate various classic and important groups with rare and exotic properties , the derivation of such a group from the corresponding automaton is far from obvious and , quite often , requires sophisticated and complex approaches .",
    "it can be seen , for example , in the original proof from  @xcite finding the lamplighter group @xmath75 as a self - similar group or in a long history discovering a free group behind the aleshin type automaton .",
    "we hope that our construction will not only fill the gap in self - similar automaton representations for a large class of lamplighter groups , but also can serve as a useful tool in the further study of these groups , in particular , via their dynamics and geometry on the corresponding tree .",
    "we also think that it will help to better understand the connection between the structure of an automaton over a changing alphabet and the group it defines .",
    "in the introduction , we have already presented the notion of a changing alphabet @xmath27 , a time - varying automaton @xmath18 , their shifts @xmath142 , @xmath143 ( @xmath35 ) and a self - similar group over a changing alphabet .",
    "now , we only recall the necessary notions and facts concerning the tree @xmath5 of finite words over @xmath6 and automaton transformations @xmath144 ( @xmath17 , @xmath35 ) .",
    "we define the tree @xmath5 as a disjoint sum of cartesian products @xmath145 together with the empty word @xmath146 . since the elements of a word @xmath147 are called letters , we will not separate them by commas and we will write @xmath148 , where @xmath149 are the letters .",
    "thus for a given @xmath34 the above cartesian product consists of all words @xmath147 with the length @xmath150 .",
    "if @xmath147 and @xmath151 , then @xmath152 denotes a concatenation of @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "obviously @xmath155 .",
    "the set @xmath5 has the structure of a spherically homogeneous rooted tree . the empty word is the root of this tree and two words are connected if and only if they are of the form @xmath153 and @xmath156 for some @xmath147 and @xmath157 . in particular , the @xmath96-th level @xmath158 ( @xmath112 ) of the tree @xmath5 ( that is the set of vertices at the distance @xmath96 from the root ) consists of all words of the length @xmath96 .",
    "there is a natural interpretation of an automaton @xmath18 over a changing alphabet @xmath27 as a machine , which being in a moment @xmath34 in a state @xmath17 reads a letter @xmath60 from the input tape , types the letter @xmath159 on the output tape , moves to the state @xmath160 and proceeds further to the moment @xmath161 .",
    "this allows to define for every @xmath45 and @xmath17 the transformation @xmath144 recursively : @xmath162 and if @xmath163 with @xmath164 , @xmath165 , then @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the transformation @xmath42 is called an automaton transformations of the tree @xmath43 ( corresponding to the state @xmath22 in the @xmath36-th transition of @xmath20 ) .    it is convenient to present an automaton @xmath18 over a changing alphabet @xmath27 as a labeled directed locally finite graph with the set @xmath169 as a set of vertices .",
    "two vertices are connected with an arrow if and only if they are of the form @xmath170 and @xmath171 for some @xmath112 , @xmath17 and @xmath60 .",
    "this arrow is labeled by @xmath172 , starts from the vertex @xmath170 and goes to the vertex @xmath171 .",
    "each vertex @xmath170 is labeled by the mapping @xmath173 ( the so - called labelling of the state @xmath22 in the @xmath96-th transition of @xmath20 ) .",
    "further , to make the graph of the automaton clear , we will substitute a large number of arrows connecting two given vertices and having the same direction for a one multi - arrow labeled by suitable letters and if the labelling of such a multi - arrow starting from a given vertex follows from the labelling of other arrows starting from this vertex , we will omit this labelling .",
    "generating @xmath0 , case @xmath174,width=340 ]    directly by the formula  ( [ 0 ] ) we see that in case @xmath20 invertible ( i.e. each @xmath175 is a permutation of the set @xmath33 ) , every automaton transformation @xmath176 is also invertible . by the formula ( [ 0 ] )",
    "we also see that @xmath177 preserves the lengths of words and common beginnings and hence it defines an endomorphisms of the tree @xmath109 . moreover , the composition of two automaton transformations of the same tree is also an automaton transformation of this tree and the inverse mapping to the invertible automaton transformation is also of this type ( we can show this by using an operation of the composition of two time - varying automata over the same changing alphabet and the notion of an inverse automaton - see  @xcite ) . in particular , the set of all invertible automaton transformations of a tree @xmath5 together with the composition of mappings as a product forms a proper subgroup of the group @xmath51 of automorphisms of this tree , which is denoted by @xmath178 and called the group of finite - state automorphisms .    through the rest of the text we use the right action convention in writing the composition @xmath179 of two transformation @xmath180 ,",
    "i.e. the transformation applied first is written on the left and for any word @xmath147 we have the equality @xmath181 .",
    "since the group @xmath24 is countable and residually finite , there is an infinite normal series @xmath182 with finite quotients @xmath68 and the trivial intersection .",
