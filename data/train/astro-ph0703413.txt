    "the antarctic icecap is the world s largest stable , homogeneous surface feature , comprising 75% of the current freshwater reserves on the planet . the pristine nature of the ice , with relatively few defects or impurities , results in exceptional transmission properties for both electromagnetic and acoustic / seismic signals . at wavelengths of 300 nm(/1 m ) ,",
    "electromagnetic attenuation lengths are of order 200 m(/2000 m)@xcite .",
    "the lack of substantial human and animal activity on the continent makes the icecap an ideal locale for experimental efforts seeking to measure rare collisions of extra - terrestrial objects , both microscopic@xcite and macroscopic ( meteorites , e.g.@xcite ) with the icecap itself .",
    "the long scale of signal transmission allows a radio sensor to probe an extremely large volume for englacially generated radiowave signals . in the case where ultra - high energy cosmic - ray neutrinos are measured via",
    "the coherent cherenkov radiation produced subsequent to their collision with ice molecules , ice properties must be understood . in particular , the attenuation , absorption , and possible de - polarization of the resulting electromagnetic signals due to the ice intervening between the interaction point and the detection sensor must be quantified if one is to accurately reconstruct the four - momentum of the initial neutrino .",
    "measurement of antarctic ice properties over a large footprint is particularly important for the anita experiment@xcite , which seeks to register neutrino - induced radiowave signals using a suite of high - bandwidth horn antennas mounted on a gondola . from a height of 38 km",
    ", anita monitors a mass of ice out to the horizon 680 km away .    the electromagnetic response of some medium",
    "is typically expressed in terms of a complex dielectric ` permittivity ' @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the angular frequency and @xmath4 is the polarization vector .",
    "the real part of the dielectric constant ( @xmath5 ) is related to the electromagnetic wavespeed via : @xmath6 ; in the limit of small @xmath7 , the imaginary part ( @xmath8 ) gives the power loss through the medium via : loss ( db / m)=8.686(@xmath9)(@xmath10)@xcite . here",
    ", @xmath11 is the electromagnetic wavespeed _ in vacuum _ , and @xmath12 .",
    "the response of ice as a function of polarization ( `` birefringence '' ) has been probed with a variety of measurements@xcite .",
    "asymmetries are characterized as differences in either wavespeed or absorption along linear ( generally orthogonal ) axes .",
    "formally , the two asymmetries ( @xmath13 , real and/or @xmath14 , imaginary ) are linked by the kramers - krnig dispersion relation ",
    "if one is non - zero the other must be non - zero , as well . in the absence of any preferred in - ice direction",
    ", one might expect any asymmetry to be mitigated by the random - walk nature of the birefringence .",
    "in such a case , over a total pathlength @xmath15 consisting of @xmath16 unit steps , each of which is characterized by an asymmetry @xmath17 , the average propagation time for each polarization axis should have a gaussian distribution , centered at @xmath18 , with width @xmath19 .",
    "the asymmetry distribution would therefore be a gaussian of width @xmath20 , centered at zero . for 1% birefringence ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath15=1000 m , and values of distance scale corresponding to typical grain sizes ( @xmath22 m , or n=@xmath23 ) , we expect @xmath240.1 ns . by comparison , typical neutrino - induced signal durations measured by anita are of order 3 - 4 ns , so this difference is insignificant .",
    "the impedance mismatch of air relative to ice , or ice relative to bedrock introduces non - zero reflections at that interface .",
    "the corresponding reflection and transmission coefficients , for the perpendicular and parallel components of planar incident electric field wavefronts ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ) , are given by the standard `` fresnel equations for dielectric media '' , in terms of the angle - of - incidence ( @xmath29 ) and angle - of - transmission ( @xmath30 ) , and the index of refraction ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "for anita , the change in dielectric from below the firn up through the surface interface ( i.e. , air - ice ) largely determines the volume of ice visible to the balloon . for constant voltage threshold @xmath32 ( and neglecting absorption ) , the minimum field strength observable from the balloon is given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the strength of the signal at the production point , @xmath35 is the distance from production point to observation point and @xmath32 is the voltage threshold at the detector , typically set to be at least three times the ambient thermal noise background , or : @xmath36 . for large values of @xmath34 , the observable volume is ( neglecting the 38 km altitude of the balloon , and taking @xmath35 to be measured in the horizontal plane ) disk - like . in this case , most of the sensitive volume is at the edge of the horizon and the angles of incidence relative to the balloon are close to the critical angle .",
    "our primary goal was to perform measurements important to understanding radiowave propagation through the ice , refracted at the surface , and ultimately received by the anita gondola . to that end ,",
    "a series of studies were conducted , as summarized in table [ t : intro2studies ] .",
    ".scope of radioglaciological measurements carried out at taylor dome .",
    "the `` v '' axis defines antenna orientation , and is detailed elsewhere in the text .",
    "[ t : intro2studies ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     assuming the index - of - refraction is related to density via the schytt model@xcite ( @xmath37 ) , we find reasonably good agreement between our tabulated results and the data taken from taylor dome itself . for comparison , we have also included the expected times using the @xmath38 profile using density data from the south pole .",
    "our propagation time measurements suggest that the density profile at our experimental site is slightly less sharp than the density profile obtained at taylor dome itself .",
    "figure [ fig : t_depth_with_deviation.eps ] presents our results graphically . in this case , rather than taking the `` zero '' hit time as the time recorded when the discone was at a depth of 10 meters , we compare our measurements to the 100 meter depth propagation time data .",
    "our initial goal was to measure the attenuation length of ice at a site close to the antarctic coast ( taylor dome ) and to compare that value with previous measurements at south pole .",
    "this is one of a series of anticipated experiments to map out ice properties over the large area probed by the balloon - borne anita neutrino detection experiment . using a variety of somewhat redundant measurements",
    ", we estimate the uncertainty in the expected anita signal strength due to uncertainties in transmission across the air / ice interface to be of order 10% .",
    "we observe a clear signal , reflected off of the underlying bedrock .",
    "determination of the exact signal strength for this bottom reflection is complicated by uncertainties regarding the bottom topography and the bedrock - ice reflection coefficient , as well as possible interference effects . for a variety of orientations , with both rx and tx identically polarized , and",
    "probing a variety of surface tx / rx locations over a 100-meter surface radius region , we measure peak reflected voltage values that are consistent to within approximately 30% , with a s : n of @xmath394.0 , implying attenuation lengths roughly consistent with measurements made at the south pole .",
    "additionally , we find strong evidence for an asymmetry in the real part of the ice dielectric constant , which we interpret as the first observation of time - domain birefringence .    due to the reduced maximum amplitude , the efficiency for registration of ultra - high energy neutrinos , based on a voltage threshold - crossing event trigger ,",
    "may be reduced if the birefringent asymmetry is 0.12% and the result of crystal orientation fabric ( cof ) alignment .",
    "the quantitative impact of any possible birefringence will depend on the experimental details of a given data acquisition system and the location - specific ice properties . using a monte carlo simulation for the rice@xcite experiment at the south pole , consisting of 16 vertically - oriented dipoles confined to a 200 m x 200 m",
    "x 200 m cube centered 200 m below the surface at the south pole , we estimate a loss of @xmath3915% in effective neutrino detection volume , roughly independent of neutrino energy . for the anita experiment ,",
    "the effect is expected to be considerably smaller , since the data acquisition system integrates @xmath398 ns after the initial trigger signal , and also since almost all the detected neutrino flux corresponds to the case where the cherenkov electric - field vector is polarized predominantly in the vertical plane , whereas birefringence should be most noticeable for the case where the @xmath40 polarization vector coincides with one of the principal axes of the ice crystal ( assumed to be oriented horizontally , in the case where the fabric is defined by the horizontal ice flow ) .",
    "additionally , the bulk of the sensitive volume probed by anita is slower - moving , thicker interior ice , for which birefringent effects are expected to be somewhat smaller than near the continental periphery .",
    "a suite of additional measurements at a variety of icecap locations , perhaps in association with future traverses , are needed to fully map out ice properties across the continent . in principle , the extensive measurements conducted to determine the antarctic and greenland ice thicknesses can also be searched for time delays as a function of transmitter / receiver orientation . those studies are currently underway .",
    "particularly important is the determination of dielectric properties measured in the vertical plane , for which there is thus far somewhat less _ in situ _ data .",

    "we also thank the national science foundation s office of polar programs for support under grant nsf opp-0338219 , the research corporation , the university of kansas undergraduate research award program , and the nsf s research experience for undergraduates ( reu ) program .",
