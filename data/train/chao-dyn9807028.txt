    "random matrix theory  @xcite is a powerful tool for the modeling of spectral fluctuation properties . due to the general symmetry constraints , a time - reversal invariant system with conserved or broken rotation invariance is modeled by the gaussian orthogonal ( goe ) or symplectic ensemble ( gse ) , respectively , while the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) models the fluctuation properties of a system under broken time - reversal invariance .",
    "these ensembles are known to describe the generic fluctuation properties of chaotic quantum systems very accurately  @xcite . while numerical simulations of the ensuing matrix models usually pose no serious difficulties , the analytical calculations of the observables , i.e.  the correlation functions , is generally a non - trivial task . in the case of the pure ensembles , mehta and dyson",
    "@xcite solved the problem about thirty years ago by introducing the orthogonal polynomial method .",
    "however , since a generic physical system has , classically , a mixed phase space , the spectral fluctuations of the corresponding quantum system will be in between the pure cases . the transition from preserved to broken time reversal invariance",
    "was worked out by mehta and pandey  @xcite in 1983 .",
    "the transitions of the spectral fluctuations in the case of gradually broken symmetries , i.e.  quantum numbers was computed in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite . here",
    "we will focus on a system that undergoes a transition from regular to chaotic fluctuations . to model such a system ,",
    "we write the @xmath3 random matrix representing the total hamiltonian as a sum of a regular and a chaotic part , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the dimensionless transition parameter .",
    "the matrices @xmath6 are drawn from a gaussian ensemble with the probability density function @xmath7 . here",
    ", we are mainly interested in the transition from a regular , equispaced spectrum to a chaotic one .",
    "this is a very important physical situation since many systems , particularly in nuclear and molecular physics can be described as a chaos producing part coupled to a harmonic oscillator .",
    "often , it is necessary to give the regular part @xmath8 a block structure which reflects the presence of symmetries .",
    "this was already realized by porter and rosenzweig  @xcite who investigated , experimentally and numerically , atomic spectra that contain various angular momentum and spin quantum numbers subject to different coupling schemes .",
    "however , at the moment , we make no assumptions yet for the probability distribution @xmath9 of the matrices @xmath8 .",
    "the decomposition  ( [ ha ] ) can be justified for potential and billiard systems .",
    "detailed numerical simulations for the transition of the fluctuations can be found in ref .",
    "however , despite several attempts , full  fledged analytical discussions could only recently be performed for the case of broken time reversal invariance in which the matrices @xmath6 are drawn from the gue . for a history of the studies devoted to these problems",

    "the enormous simplifications are due to the fact that supersymmetry can , loosely speaking , be viewed as the `` irreducible representation '' of random matrix theory which becomes apparent in a new class of diffusion equations  @xcite .",

    "@xcite and in the review  @xcite .    here",
    ", we address the case that all matrices @xmath94 are drawn from harmonic oscillators . in discussing the influence of a chaotic admixture to this initial condition , two different scenarios are of interest : the chaotic admixture can either preserve the symmetry or break it . in the first scenario",
    ", we have to add a gue matrix to _ every _ matrix @xmath94 .",
    "thus , we still have a superposition of independent spectra and the total matrix @xmath95 still has the block structure , i.e.  @xmath96 .    in the second scenario ,",
    "we add one @xmath97 gue matrix to the block diagonal matrix @xmath8 .",
    "thus , for non  zero transition parameter , the total matrix @xmath95 has no block structure .",
    "this scenario is in the spirit of the porter  rosenzweig model  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath98 such a symmetry breaking was investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite . in these studies , however , and in contrast to the present one , the initial condition was also chaotic .",
    "we discuss the first scenario in sec .",
    "[ sec41 ] , before we briefly turn to the second one in sec .",
    "[ sec42 ] .",
    "each of the block matrices is a harmonic oscillator , coupled to a gue . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that all blocks matrices shall have the same dimension @xmath91 and the same coupling to the gue . moreover , to lift the degeneracies , the @xmath89 oscillator spectrum is chosen with an energy shift @xmath99 ( cf .",
    "eq.([hospec ] ) ) .",
    "we are interested in the unfolded two  point correlation function @xmath100 where @xmath92 is the fractional density of each block matrix . to motivate this equation",
    ", we notice that @xmath101 is the probability density of finding a level at @xmath102 and another one at @xmath103 .",
    "the levels can either belong to the same symmetry sector ( first line of eq .",
    "( [ super2 ] ) ) or to different symmetry sectors ( second and third line of eq .",
    "( [ super2 ] ) ) .",
    "since the second line includes also correlations within one symmetry sector ( these have been accounted for in the first line ) , the third line must be subtracted .",
    "we emphasize once more that the functions @xmath104 are not unity in the case of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "we now insert the the two  point function ( [ 2point ] ) with the appropriate energy shifts into eq .",
    "( [ super2 ] ) and interchange the summation over @xmath93 with the summation over @xmath105 . for @xmath106 ,",
    "this yields expressions like @xmath107 which help to perform one more summation .",
    "the final result reads for @xmath108 @xmath109 in the limit of vanishing @xmath52 we find @xmath110 and in the limit of infinite transition parameter we recover the two  point correlation function for a superposition of @xmath2 gue s @xmath111 for large @xmath2 and nonzero transition parameter @xmath52 , the two  point correlation function approaches the value one .",
    "thus , the spectrum becomes completely uncorrelated and exhibits the same correlations as the ( randomly generated ) poisson  spectrum .",
    "we also note , that the two  point correlation function ( [ super2p ] ) depends only on the difference @xmath112 of its arguments .",
    "this translation invariance results from the assumption that the @xmath113 spectrum is shifted by @xmath114 mean level spacings .",
    "thus , any deviation from translation invariance gives a hint to clustering or degeneracy of levels belonging to different symmetry sectors .",
    "figure  [ superplot ] shows the a plot of @xmath115 $ ] for various values of the coupling @xmath52 .",
    "this function depends only on the ratios @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "we turn to the second scenario defined above .",
    "we do this briefly , because we mainly want to show the very different structure of the result . in general , the initial condition on the original scale takes the form @xmath118 where the initial conditions @xmath119 are still completely arbitrary . on the unfolded scale , we have @xmath120 these formulae have to be inserted into eqs .",
    "( [ cfm ] ) and  ( [ cfum ] ) , respectively , to obtain the correlation functions .",
    "if all @xmath2 initial ensembles are chosen as harmonic oscillators , we find from eq .",
    "( [ zkpu ] ) on the unfolded scale @xmath121 since this is still a product , the determinant structure  ( [ det ] ) of the @xmath0point correlation functions is still preserved .",

    "this is precisely eq .",
    "( [ zkpu ] ) for @xmath126 .",
