    "solutions of highly charged polymers are known to develop novel structural properties due to the interplay between electrostatic interactions and entropic effects @xcite . for example",

    "this experiment is perhaps a most direct manifestation of the peculiar behavior of polyelectrolytes in high density solutions : the dense phase is characterized by multi - axial liquid crystalline behavior @xcite , as well as exceedingly slow dynamics that leads to the formation of an actin gel @xcite .",
    "a similar self - assembly pattern has been observed in the structure of the nuclear lamina  a charged filamentous integral membrane protein network that provides a cytoskeletal support for the nuclear membrane @xcite .",
    "another interesting example is the observation of slow modes in the dynamics of various high - density polyelectrolyte solutions in the absence of salt , where it is suggested that correlations cause the formation of starlike complexes with considerably slow dynamics @xcite .",
    "these examples raise the issue that strong many - body coulombic correlations for extended ( non - pointlike ) charged objects could lead to novel features that are poorly understood .    based on such experimental evidence",

    "[ fig : phase1 ] ) , while the rods still respect the planar ordering , a multitude of transitions occur taking the system through a variety of minimum energy configurations . for example , upon increasing the density , a phase appears in which successive cross - like structures formed by two neighboring rods are rotated relative to each other around the @xmath36-axis by an angle @xmath68 , which corresponds to a chiral ordering with a basis .",
    "finally , in the high - density region where @xmath69 , the rods are no longer confined in the planes .",
    "while in this regime one also finds various kinds of orderings , eventually the rods tend to approach a spherical configuration that resembles a `` sea urchin '' [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : phase1](d ) ] , as @xmath1 approaches its smallest possible value @xmath70 that is set by the thickness of the rods .",
    "note that only a very small choice of the cutoff length , such as our choice of @xmath71 , can allow for these complicated high - density phases to exist .",
    "moreover , unlike the lower density cases , this part of the phase diagram depends very sensitively on the choice of charge distribution on the rods , namely the value of @xmath7 as well as whether the charges are smeared or discrete .",
    "the low - temperature chiral ordering ( in either of its various forms ) is not easily achieved in its complete form when the system is cooled down from the disordered phase to temperatures below the transition line .",
    "this means that the equilibrium dynamics of the system involves a rather slow process , which we try to identify and study here .    for @xmath72 , the array of rods is decomposed into several domains of the chiral structure with both positive and negative values of @xmath51 , corresponding to the degenerate minima of energy shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] .",
    "the neighboring left - handed and right - handed domains are regions that typically contain just a few rods , and are linked via what can be thought of as _ kinks_. by definition , the kinks annihilate when they meet each other or when they reach the boundaries of the system .",
    "we observe that the density of the kinks is more or less fixed to about one kink for every 40 rods or so , irrespective of the size of the system .",
    "these kinks are observed to have very slow dynamics , presumably due to the electrostatic frustration , so that a considerably long mc time is needed before all the kinks are annihilated and one of the domains spans the entire system .",
    "the mc time needed for the annihilation of the kinks increases with increasing the system size .",
    "we also note that when the energy has four minima ( for @xmath1 just below @xmath66 ) and two kinds of chiral structures are possible , different kinds of kinks are observed depending on the type of the two neighboring domains that are linked .     and various temperatures , reported in units of @xmath30 .",

    "( [ c(t ) ] ) . for long enough waiting times ( @xmath80 mc steps for @xmath24 ) ) , the relaxation function @xmath76 is independent of @xmath81 as well as the system initial conditions , indicating that there is no difference between averaging over time [ eq .",
    "( [ c(t ) ] ) ] and averaging over different initial conditions of the system .",
    "note that the waiting time is typically the time needed for the kinks to annihilate . in fig .",

    "the exponent @xmath73 saturates to a constant of the order of @xmath84 in the high temperature regime , while it drops at lower temperatures where the relaxation is exceedingly slower .",
    "the stretched - exponential form for the relaxation is a feature that is often encountered in the dynamics of frustrated systems @xcite .",
    "in a most simple realization of the system , we have shown that charged linear objects in close separation can develop novel collective orientational correlations as well as an unusually slow dynamics , due to the frustration in the orientational degrees of freedom .",
    "while in our simple model system we assume that the rods are positioned in a lattice , we expect that removing this constraint will cause the orientational correlations to manifest themselves as liquid crystalline structures such as those observed in ref .",
    "geometrical frustration induced by the dimensionality of the arrangement could also affect the orientational ordering , and it remains to be seen what kind of arrangement is favored by the liquid system itself , i.e. , what is the coupling between the positional- and the orientational correlations in this frustrated system .",
    "let us examine the effect of screening by added - salt in the above results .",
    "for a low concentration of added salt , the screening is weak and we expect that the results reported here will hold true so long as the screening length is the largest length in the system . as the salt concentration is increased , however , the debye length begins to compete with the other length scales and this could change the phase behavior of the system .        we have performed simulations with the screened coulomb interaction of eq .",
    "( [ u - def ] ) using different values for the debye screening length .",
    "we find that the general structure of the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase1 ] persists , while the size of the chiral domain in the phase diagram shrinks as @xmath85 is increased . in fig .",
    "[ fig : screen ] , the first order phase transition line is shown for three values of the debye length for @xmath43 and @xmath22 .",
    "it can be seen that even for @xmath86 the value of @xmath53 barely changes as compared to its @xmath23 value of @xmath87 .",
    "our results suggest that @xmath88 sets the threshold where screening can wipe out the chiral ordering altogether .",
    "we have neglected the effect of counterions in the above study .",
    "this can be justified by noting that the polyelectrolytes are very short rods and unless we choose extremely high values for @xmath89 , it is unlikely that they condense on the rods .",
    "this means that they will move relatively freely in the vicinity of the linear polyelectrolyte array , and merely participate in the debye screening of the interaction .",
    "this effect can be taken into account by considering a local effective value for the debye length that incorporates the density of the counterions as well as that of salt .",
    "moreover , the presence of the counterions in an effective `` cell '' around the array provides the necessary neutralization of the system . in our treatment , however , we did not need to care about the neutralization criterion because the centers of the charged rods are fixed in space and in effect it is only multipoles ( not monopoles ) that are interacting .    finally , we note that the results obtained here are related to the studies of the equilibrium configuration of ions in a confined plasma , where even similar chiral phases are observed as the confinement potential becomes anisotropic @xcite .",
