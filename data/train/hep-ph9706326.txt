    "evolution equations play an important role in both inclusive @xcite and exclusive @xcite hard processes .",

    "the main ingredients of these equations are the perturbatively calculable evolution kernels .",
    "the two - loop dglap evolution kernels @xmath0 were obtained in @xcite , and a more complicated two - loop kernel @xmath1 of the brodsky  lepage ( bl ) evolution equation for meson wave functions was calculated in @xcite . a three - loop calculation of these kernels",
    "looks like being a tremendous problem .",
    "recently , the results of very complicated calculations of the first few elements of the three - loop anomalous dimension of composite operators in dis  @xmath6 have been presented in @xcite . lately",
    ", these results were applied to improve the qcd analysis of dis experimental data @xcite . despite this important technical and phenomenological progress",
    "one may feel insufficiency because of the absence of the whole kernel in this order or , even at least , some parts of it .",
    "of course , the kernel admitting a physical probability interpretation is a more general and convenient object from the theoretical point of view .",
    "a method of estimating anomalous dimensions of composite operators in the limit of a large number of flavours , @xmath7 , has been suggested by j. gracey @xcite . it is based on conformal properties of the theory at the critical point @xmath8 corresponding to the non - trivial zero @xmath9 of the @xmath10-dimensional @xmath11-function @xmath12 .",
    "the generating function has been constructed to obtain the leading large-@xmath7 asymptotics of the anomalous dimension @xmath13 to any order @xmath14 of perturbation theory ( pt ) .    in this letter ,",
    "i propose a method of calculating certain classes of multiloop diagrams directly for the dglap kernel @xmath0 as well as for the bl kernel @xmath1 in the scheme rather than their moments as in @xcite .",
    "these diagrams contain insertion of chains of one - loop self - energy parts ( renormalon chains ) into the one - loop diagrams ( see fig.1 a , b ) for kernels .",
    "the kernels @xmath15 are obtained for any order @xmath14 of pt by analysing of these  dressed by chain \" diagrams .",
    "then , the kernel @xmath16  ( @xmath17 ) for diagrams with the totally dressed propagator ( , in the  all loops \" approximation ) is calculated ; this kernel appears to be a generating function to obtain the partial kernels @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , this kernel @xmath16 is the analytic function in variable of a coupling constant @xmath18 .",
    "the insertions of the renormalon chains lead to converged pt series , and the usual renormalon singularities do nt appear in the renormgroup function calculations .",
    "this was found first for @xmath11- and @xmath19-functions in  @xcite , the following development of this approach is presented in  @xcite .",
    "it is to be stressed that the method of obtaining @xmath20 or @xmath17 does not depend on the nature of self - energy insertions and does not appeal to the value of parameters @xmath21 or  @xmath22 ( for qcd case ) associated with different loops .",
    "another distinctive feature is that the pt - improved evolution kernels are calculated in the direct and standard way by using rather elementary methods .",
    "this is possible due to a simple algebraic structure of the counterterms of the diagrams considered . in this letter , we mainly present technical results on resummation of the above mentioned counterterms within the framework of the @xmath2_6 $ ] model and , in part , in qcd . the solution to the bl evolution equation for a large number of flavors",

    "this theory has much in common with qcd : it is renormalizable and its @xmath11-function has a structure similar to that of @xmath27 , @xmath28 moreover , the one - loop evolution kernels @xmath29 and @xmath30 , following from the simplest triangular diagram in figs.1a and 1b , turn out to be proportional to the corresponding expressions for the same diagrams in qcd ap_0(z)=a(1-z ) ,  av_0(x , y)= a ( ( y > x)+ ( > ) ) , where  @xmath31 .",

    "@xmath32 @xcite and @xmath33 @xcite is quite analogous to that of the anomalous dimensions .",
