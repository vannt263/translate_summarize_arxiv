    "better understanding of optical phenomena and nanoscale energy transfer has enabled advances in optical technologies , e.g. , in nanoplasmonics @xcite , near - field microscopy @xcite , thin - film light - emitting diodes @xcite , photonic crystals @xcite , and metamaterials @xcite .",
    "these advances are strongly influenced by the availability of simple and transparent theoretical tools that allow in - depth understanding of the pertinent phenomena in sufficiently simple form . formulating a simple and sufficiently detailed description of the quantum aspects of energy transfer in lossy resonant structures ,",
    "however , has been particularly challenging due to several phenomena , such as wave - particle dualism , intertwined electric and magnetic fields , and field - matter interactions @xcite , affecting the energy transfer .",
    "we have recently introduced quantized fluctuational electrodynamics ( qfed ) formalism @xcite for the description of field - matter interactions and the formation of thermal balance in nonequilibrium conditions in dielectric media . using the qfed approach it has finally become possible to formulate the canonical commutation relations preserving ladder and photon - number operators for the total electromagnetic field also in resonant structures @xcite , thus resolving the previously reported anomalies in their commutation relations @xcite . here",
    "we present a more general qfed formalism that also accounts for the interactions arising due to magnetic effects .",
    "the need to formulate the unified theory emerges from the present observation that the single electric noise operator picture is insufficient to correctly describe the field - matter interactions in the general case . instead , the use of two commuting bosonic noise source operators is needed to formulate the general model . by using two separate operators",
    "it becomes straightforward to develop the qfed model starting from the macroscopic maxwell s equations and the polarization and magnetization related material responses .    after deriving the generalized qfed formalism",
    ", we apply it to show that , due to the magnetic purcell effect , we can tune the position of the emitter in a vacuum cavity such that the emissivity of a magnetic emitter significantly exceeds the emissivity of a corresponding electric emitter .",
    "this is a consequence of different position dependences of the electric and magnetic local densities of states ( ldoss ) .",
    "the differences in emissivities are expected to be experimentally observable by detecting the output radiation with a photodetector or an antenna .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows : the theory is presented in sec .",

    "it covers the introduction of the quantized equations , representation of the green s functions and the related noise source operators .",
    "we also briefly review the theory of field fluctuations , photon numbers , poynting vector , and absorption and emission operators while presenting the new generalized forms of the densities of states . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we investigate the physical implications of the concepts by applying the methods to study the emissivity of electric and magnetic emitters placed inside the vacuum cavity and demonstrate the different characteristics of the two fundamentally different source terms of our theory .",
