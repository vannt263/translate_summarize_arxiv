    "the run ii at the tevatron will define a new level of precision for qcd studies in hadron collisions .",
    "both collider experiments , cdf and d0 , expect to collect up to @xmath1 of data in this new run period .",
    "the increase in instantaneous luminosity , center - of - mass energy ( from 1.8 tev to 2 tev ) and the improved acceptance of the detectors will allow stringent tests of the standard model ( sm ) predictions in extended regions of jet transverse momentum , @xmath2 , and jet rapidity , @xmath3 .",
    "the hadronic final states in hadron - hadron collisions are characterized by the presence of soft contributions ( the so - called _ underlying event _ ) from initial - state gluon radiation and mutiple parton interactions between remnants , in addition to the jets of hadrons originated by the hard interaction .",
    "a proper comparison with pqcd predictions at the parton level requires an adequate modeling of these soft contributions which become important at low @xmath4 . in this letter ,",
    "a review of some of the most important qcd results from run ii is presented .",
    "the measurement of the inclusive jet production cross section for central jets constitutes one of the pillars of the jet physics program at the tevatron .",
    "it provides a stringent test of perturbative qcd predictions over almost nine orders of magnitude and probes distances up to @xmath5 .",
    "thanks to the increase in the center - of - mass energy in run ii the jet production rate has been multiplied ( by a factor of five for jets with @xmath6  gev ) and the first measurements have already extended the @xmath7 coverage by 150  gev compared to run i. in addition , both cdf and d0  experiments explore new jet algorithms following the theoretical work that indicates that the cone - based jet algorithm employed in run i is not infrared safe and compromises a future meanful comparison with pqcd calculations at nnlo .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the measured inclusive jet cross section by cdf using the longitudinally invariant @xmath8 algorithm @xcite and based on the first 145 @xmath9 of run ii data .",
    "measurements have been performed using values for the d parameter in the @xmath8 expression , @xmath10 equal to 0.5 , 0.7 and 1.0 .",
    "the measurements are compared to pqcd nlo calculations  @xcite using cteq6  @xcite parton density functions in the proton and antiproton and the renormalization and factorization scales set to @xmath11 .",
    "the measured cross section is reasonably well described by the predictions for @xmath12 within the present uncertainties .",
    "the systematic errors on the data are dominated by the uncertainty on the jet energy scale determination while the theoretical predictions suffer from our limited knowledge of the gluon distribution at high @xmath13 . at lower @xmath7",
    ", the data is systematically above the predictions and the effect increases as d increases ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this indicates the presence of soft - gluon contributions and fragmentation effects that have not been taken into account yet .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the measured inclusive jet cross section by d0 based on the first 143@xmath9 of run ii data .",
    "the new midpoint@xcite jet algorithm has been used with a cone size r=0.7 .",
    "this algorithm constitutes an improved version of the cone - based algorithm used in run i and it is shown to be infrared safe when used in fixed - order parton - level calculations .",
    "the data is in good agreement with the pqcd nlo predictions using cteq6 parton density functions and @xmath14 .",
    "however , the measurement is dominated by a relatively large uncertainty on the absolute jet energy scale .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the measured cross section by d0 as a function of the dijet invariant mass in dijet production of central jets .",
    "this measurement is particularly sensitive to the presence of narrow resonances decaying into jets of hadrons up to masses of 1.3 tev .",
    "the data is well described by pqcd nlo predictions .",
    "nowadays , the tevatron high-@xmath2 jet data is used , together with prompt - photon data from fixed target experiments , to constrain the gluon distribution at high-@xmath13 .",
    "jet measurements at large rapidities are important because they constrain the gluon density in a region in @xmath7 where no effect from new physics is expected .",
    "the d0 experiment has already extended the jet cross section measurements to the forward region for jets with @xmath15 ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) .    at the moment , the results are affected by large systematic errors . in the near future",
    "the experiments will highly reduce their uncertainties and precise cross section measurements will allow to further constrain the gluon distribution and thus enhance their sensitivity to new physics at very high @xmath7 .",
    "as mentioned in previous section , the hadronic final states at the tevatron are characterized by the presence of soft underlying emissions , usually denoted as _ underlying event _ , in addition to highly energetic jets coming from the hard interaction .",
    "the underlying event contains contributions from initial- and final - state soft gluon radiation , secondary semi - hard partonic interactions and interactions between the proton and anti - proton remnants that can not be described by perturbation theory .",
    "these processes must be approximately modeled using monte carlo programs tuned to describe the data .",
    "the jet energies measured in the detector contain an underlying event contribution that has to be subtracted in order to compare the measurements to pqcd predictions .",
    "hence , a proper understanding of this underlying event contribution is crucial to reach the desired precision in the measured jet cross sections . in the analysis presented here ,",
    "the underlying event in dijet production has been studied by looking at regions well separated from the leading jets , where the underlying event contribution is expected to dominate the observed hadronic activity .",
    "jets have been reconstructed using tracks with @xmath16 gev and @xmath17 and a cone algorithm with r=0.7 .",
    "the @xmath18 space around the leading jet is divided in three regions : _ towards _ , _ away _ and _ transverse _ ( see figure  [ fig6]-left ) , and the transverse region is assumed to reflect the underlying event contribution",
    ".    figure  [ fig6]-right shows the average track density in the transverse region as a function of @xmath19 of the leading jet for the dijet inclusive sample and for events where the leading jets are forced to be back - to - back in @xmath18 , in order to further reduce extra hard - gluon radiation .",
    "the observed plateau indicates that the underlying event activity is , to a large extend , independent from the hard interaction .",
    "the measurements have been compared to the predictions from pythia  @xcite and herwig  @xcite monte carlo programs including leading - order qcd matrix elements plus initial and final parton showers .",
    "the pythia samples have been created using a special tuned set of parameters , denoted as pythia - tune a , which includes an enhanced contribution from initial - state soft gluon radiation and a tuned set of parameter to control secondary parton interactions .",
    "it was determined as a result of similar studies of the underlying event performed using cdf run i data @xcite .",
    "pythia - tune a describes the hadronic activity in transverse region while herwig underestimates the radiation at low @xmath19 .",
    "similar measurements in z+jet(s ) events would allow to explore the univesality of the underlying event contribution in events with a very different colour configuration in the final state .",
    "the internal structure of jets is dominated by multi - gluon emissions from the primary final - state parton .",
    "it is sensitive to the relative quark- and gluon - jet fraction and receives contributions from soft - gluon initial - state radiation and beam remnant - remnant interactions .",
    "the study of jet shapes at the tevatron provides a stringent test of qcd predictions and tests the validity of the models for parton cascades and soft - gluon emissions in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "the cdf experiment has presented results on jet shapes for central jets with transverse momentum in the region",
    "@xmath20 gev @xmath21  gev , where jets are searched for using the midpoint merging fraction has been used instead of the default @xmath22 . ]",
    "algorithm and a cone size @xmath23 .",
    "the integrated jet shape , @xmath24 , is defined as the average fraction of the jet transverse momentum that lies inside a cone of radius @xmath25 concentric to the jet cone : @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the number of jets .",
    "the measured jet shapes have been compared to the predictions from pythia - tune a and herwig monte carlo programs .",
    "in addition , two different pythia samples have been used with default parameters and with and without the contribution from multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) between proton and antiproton remnants , the latter denoted as pythia-(no mpi ) , to illustrate the importance of a proper modeling of soft - gluon radiation in describing the measured jet shapes .",
    "figure  [ fig7](left ) presents the measured integrated jet shapes , @xmath28 , for jets with @xmath29 gev , compared to herwig , pythia - tune a , pythia and pythia-(no mpi ) predictions .",
    "in addition , figure  [ fig7](right ) shows , for a fixed radius @xmath30 , the average fraction of the jet transverse momentum outside @xmath31 , @xmath32 , as a function of @xmath33 where the points are located at the weighted mean in each @xmath33 range .",
    "the measurements show that the fraction of jet transverse momentum at a given fixed @xmath34 increases ( @xmath32 decreases ) with @xmath33 , indicating that the jets become narrower as @xmath33 increases .",
    "pythia with default parameters produces jets systematically narrower than the data in the whole region in @xmath33 .",
    "the contribution from secondary parton interactions between remnants to the predicted jet shapes ( shown by the difference between pythia and pythia-(no mpi ) predictions ) is relatively small and decreases as @xmath33 increases .",
    "pythia - tune a predictions describe all of the data well .",
    "herwig predictions describe the measured jet shapes well for @xmath35 gev but produces jets that are too narrow at lower @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ fig8](left ) shows the measured integrated jet shapes , @xmath28 , for jets with @xmath29 gev , compared to pythia - tune a and the predictions for quark- and gluon - jets plane ) its directions with that of one of the outgoing partons from the hard interaction . ]",
    "figure  [ fig8](right ) shows the measured @xmath32 , @xmath30 , as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "the monte carlo predictions indicate that the measured jet shapes are dominated by contributions from gluon - initiated jets at low @xmath33 while contributions from quark - initiated jets become important at high @xmath33 .",
    "this can be explained in terms of the different partonic contents in the proton and antiproton in the low- and high-@xmath33 regions , since the mixture of gluon- and quark - jet in the final state partially reflects the nature of the incoming partons that participate in the hard interaction . for a given type of parton - jet in the monte carlo ( quark- or gluon - jet ) ,",
    "the observed trend with @xmath33 shows the running of the strong coupling constant , @xmath36 .",
    "jet shape measurements thus introduce strong constrains on phenomenological models describing soft - gluon radiation and the underlying event in hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "similar studies with b - tagged jets will be necessary to test our knowledge of b - quark jet fragmentation processes in hadronic interactions , which is essential for future precise top and higgs measurements .",
    "the d0 experiment has employed the dijet sample to study azimuthal decorrelations , @xmath37 , between the two leading jets . the normalized cross section :",
    "@xmath38 is sensitive to the spectrum of the gluon radiation in the event .",
    "the measurements has been performed in different regions of the leading jet @xmath7 starting at @xmath39  gev and the second jet is requied to have at least @xmath40  gev .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows the measured cross section compared to lo and nlo predictions from nlojet++ program  @xcite .",
    "the lo predictions , with at most three partons in the final state , is limited to @xmath41 , for which the three partons define a _ mercedes - star _ topology .",
    "it presents a prominent peak at @xmath42 corresponding to the soft limit for which the third parton is collinear to the direction of the two leading partons .",
    "the nlo predictions , with four partons in the final state , describes the measured @xmath37 distribution except at very high and very low values of @xmath37 where additional soft constributions , corresponding to a resummed calculation , are necessary . a reasonable approximation to such calculations is provided by parton shower monte carlo programs .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] presents the measured cross section compared to pythia - tune a , pythia and herwig predictions in different regions of @xmath7 .",
    "pythia with default parameters underestimates the gluon radiation at large angles .",
    "pythia - tune a predictions , which include an enhanced contribution from initial - state soft gluon radiation and secondary parton interactions , describe the azimuthal distribution .",
    "herwig also describes the data although tends to produce less radiation than pythia - tune a close to the direction of the leading jets .",
    "both cdf and @xmath0 experiments have carried out measurements of the inclusive jet production cross section in run ii at the tevatron using different jet algorithms .",
    "the measurements are in agreement with pqcd nlo predictions",
    ". dedicated studies of the underlying event , jet shapes and azimuthal decorrelations in dijet final states allowed to establish the validity of the monte carlo models used to describe the soft - gluon contributions in the final state .",
