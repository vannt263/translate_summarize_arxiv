    "a number of problems in computational physics require the solution of divergence - form elliptic equations @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a scalar function with steep internal layers in a domain @xmath3 .",

    "equations of the form ( [ pde1 ] ) arise , for example , in fluid dynamics @xcite , where @xmath2 is the inverse of the fluid density and in semiconductor device simulation @xcite , where @xmath2 can be either the semiconductor permittivity , or a complicated function determined by electron and hole mobilities and diffusion coefficients .",
    "they also arise in phase field models for microstructure evolution in materials science @xcite . when @xmath7 is piecewise constant , boundary integral equation methods are well - known to be extremely effective ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",

    "we assume that @xmath11 is positive , smooth and bounded , but may have steep gradients , so that its derivative @xmath12 can be arbitrarily large , corresponding to an internal layer . without care ,",
    "this can lead to arbitrarily badly conditioned linear systems . while there is some literature on analyzing the conditioning of second kind integral equations ( see , for example , @xcite ) ,",
    "the influence of the choice of @xmath0 space has received relatively little attention . here , we show that a combination of adaptivity and a suitable _ norm - preserving _ discretization , to be defined below , leads to condition numbers that depend only weakly on @xmath13 . in particular , we show that for a lippmann - schwinger type integral equation with the second derivative @xmath14 as the unknown , a discretization that is norm - perserving in @xmath15 leads to nearly optimal schemes .",

    "theorem [ condthm1 ] gives us a sense of the qualitative behavior of @xmath69 acting on @xmath0 spaces .",

    "since the condition number in @xmath0 depends on the @xmath81 norm of @xmath74 in this case , it is clear that the condition number of @xmath80 will be modest in @xmath82 and very large in @xmath15 in the presence of internal layers .",
    "in order to analyze the condition number of discretized integral equations , it is convenient to introduce the following definition .",

    "let @xmath86 be an invertible , bounded integral operator mapping @xmath87 to @xmath88 .",

    "setting , it is easy to show something equally useful , namely that the condition number of a norm - preserving discretization approximates that of the original operator .    for this , let @xmath94 denote the restriction of an operator @xmath95 to a subspace @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath86 be an invertible , bounded operator mapping @xmath87 to @xmath88 , let @xmath91 , @xmath90 be norm - preserving mappings and let @xmath97 be a norm - preserving discretization of @xmath86 , as above .",
    "then , @xmath98 thus , the condition number of @xmath97 restricted to @xmath99 and of @xmath86 restricted to @xmath87 are the same .",
    "we build ( approximate ) norm - preserving nystrm discretizations for @xmath86 by applying a quadrature rule to the integral operator @xmath100 : @xmath101 for this , we assume that we are given an @xmath102-point quadrature rule @xmath103 with positive weights .",
    "this induces a mapping @xmath90 : @xmath70 \\rightarrow { { \\mathbb c}}^n$ ] : @xmath104 if the quadrature rule is exact for functions of the form @xmath105 for @xmath85 and @xmath106 for @xmath107 , then @xmath90 is a norm - preserving mapping from @xmath87 into @xmath108 and @xmath88 into @xmath108 .",
    "further , suppose that the quadrature rule is exact for functions of the form @xmath109 where @xmath85 , and that @xmath97 is given by th nystrm discretization : @xmath110 then @xmath97 is norm - preserving , since @xmath111_i & = g(x_i ) w_i^{1/p } + w_i^{1/p }   \\sum_{j=1}^n k(x_i , x_j ) w_j^{1 - 1/p } g(x_j ) w_j^{1/p } \\\\ & = w_i^{1/p } \\left ( g(x_i ) + \\int_a^b k(x_i , y ) g(y ) \\ , dy \\right ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that discretization by _ sampling _ , i.e. where @xmath112 corresponds to a norm - preserving nystrm discretization on the space @xmath72 \\cap c[a , b]$ ] . in particular ,",
    "suppose we let @xmath113 \\cap c[a , b]$ ] be equicontinuous and let @xmath114 .",
    "then , by taking a fine enough mesh we can clearly satisfy @xmath115 for any @xmath116 . in short , the simplest nystrm discretization , corresponding to sampling the unknown on a grid , results in a discrete operator whose condition number approximates that of the continuous operator acting on @xmath72 \\cap c[a , b]$ ] .      two aspects of norm - preserving discretations should be noted here .",
    "first , the fact that a discretized operator equation is well - conditioned in @xmath117 for some @xmath118 may not be very informative if we solve the finite - dimensional linear algebra problem using a different norm .",
    "suppose , for example , that we wish to solve the equation ( [ inteq1 ] ) , which is well - conditioned in @xmath15 .",
    "after discretization using ( [ ahijeq ] ) , it is well - conditioned in @xmath119 as well .",
    "however , if we use an iterative scheme such as gmres @xcite , we would like to ensure rapid convergence , which depends on the condition number in @xmath120 .",
    "( one could , of course , solve linear systems iteratively in @xmath117 spaces , but the procedures are nonlinear and much more expensive . )",
    "fortunately , in finite dimensional spaces , norms and condition numbers are all equivalent and satisfy simple relations @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xmath121 thus , if the system size is modest and we employ a norm - preserving discretization for @xmath15 , we will have an acceptable bound on the @xmath120 condition number of the system matrix ( [ ahijeq ] ) .    a second , closely related , feature of norm - preserving discretizations is that spatial adaptivity is _ essential _ for the choice of @xmath0 to have an impact .",
    "one can see from ( [ ahijeq ] ) that for a uniform mesh ( with @xmath122 for all @xmath123 ) , the resulting matrix @xmath97 is the same for every @xmath118 .",
    "thus , if the continuous operator equation has a large condition number in @xmath16 , the discretized equation will be ill - conditioned in @xmath120 as well .",
    "we will return to these issues in section [ sec : discussion ] , following an exploration of the behavior of the @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath124 discretizations on some model problems .",
    "to investigate the utility of the analysis outlined above , let us first consider functions @xmath11 in ( [ ode1 ] ) of the form @xmath125 on the interval @xmath126 $ ] , where @xmath127 . for large values of @xmath128 , these functions have a steep internal layer centered at @xmath129 .",
    "they are relatively flat away from the internal layer .",
    "and they are bounded in the range @xmath130 $ ] . as a result",
    ", the family @xmath131 satisfies properties 1 and 2 as given in definition [ propdef ] .",
    "note that the derivative @xmath132 , so that    @xmath133    combining ( [ epsxup ] ) with ( [ epsxlow ] ) and the fact that the @xmath134 are uniformly bounded above and below , we have    @xmath135    for @xmath71 , using the standard `` big theta '' notation .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath136 letting @xmath69 and @xmath80 be the operators given by the left hand sides of ( [ inteq1a ] ) and ( [ inteq2a ] ) , respectively , and applying theorem 1 to the family @xmath58 , we see that @xmath137 likewise , we have @xmath138    we discretize the integral equations ( [ inteq1 ] ) and ( [ inteq2 ] ) , using a norm - preserving nystrm discretization scheme , as described in section [ nystrom ] . for this , we adaptively refine the interval @xmath9 $ ] so that the function @xmath11 is well resolved with a piecewise legendre polynomial approximation to a user - specified precision .",
    "more precisely , we use piecewise 16_th _ order approximations , and refine each interval until the quadrature error in integrating @xmath7 is less than @xmath139 . on each subinterval , we sample all functions involved @xmath140 at the scaled gauss - legendre nodes of order @xmath141 .",
    "we use the standard gauss - legendre quadrature weights scaled to each subinterval . given these nodes and weights , the norm - preserving discretization ( [ ahijeq ] ) in @xmath0 applied to equation ( [ inteq1 ] ) yields @xmath142 likewise , equation ( [ inteq2 ] ) yields @xmath143 where @xmath144 is simply the right hand side of ( [ inteq2 ] ) .",
    "we will use @xmath145 and @xmath146 to denote the @xmath118-norm - preserving discretizations of these integral operators . because the unknowns @xmath22 and @xmath46 are weighted by @xmath147",
