    "binary data are commonly observed and analyzed in many application fields : behavioral and social research , biosciences , document classification , and inference on binary images .",
    "for example , ekholm et al .",
    "( 2000 ) analyzed biomedical data including five unequally spaced binary self - assessment measurements of arthritis and obesity data on the presence or absence of obesity in five cohorts of children .",
    "also , the binarized data of the movielens 100k and the netflix dataset , which are popular datasets for collaborative filtering tasks , have been analyzed by kozma et al .",
    "one of the purposes of analyzing binary data , as well as continuous data , is the partitioning of binary objects into several unpredetermined homogeneous groups ( clusters ) .",
    "for clustering of multivariate data , it is quite important to know if some of the variables do not contribute much to the structure of clusters because the inclusion of redundant information can reduce the performance of the cluster analysis ( milligan , 1996 ) . also , a lower - dimensional ( say two or three dimensional ) representation of the cluster structure , based on the most significant information , is very useful for evaluating and interpreting the results of the cluster analysis .",
    "hence , what is needed is a procedure that constructs a low - dimensional representation of the multivariate binary data , such that the cluster structure in the data is maximally revealed . for this purpose ,",
    "researchers often carry out a preliminary dimension reduction technique ( e.g. , collins et al . , 2002 ; schein et al .",
    ", 2003 ; lee et al . ,",
    "cluster analysis is then performed on the object scores on the first few principal components .",
    "although it is easy to implement , this two - step sequential approach , also called the tandem approach , provides no assurance that the components extracted in the first step are optimal for the subsequent cluster analysis , because the two steps are implemented separately by optimizing a different loss function ( arabie and hubert , 1994 ; desarbo et al . , 1990 ;",
    "de soete and carroll , 1994 ; vichi and kiers , 2001 ; timmerman et al .",
    ", 2010 ; yamamoto and hwang , 2014 ) . for multivariate continuous data , instead of the two - step tandem clustering procedure , several methods that simultaneously perform cluster analysis and dimension reduction have been proposed ( de soete and carroll , 1994 ; vichi and kiers , 2001 , ghahramani and hinton , 1997 ; yoshida et al . , 2004 ) .    on the other hand , for multivariate binary data , a few methods can conduct the analysis for simultaneously obtaining a cluster structure and a subspace for the cluster structure .",
    "patrikainen and mannila ( 2004 ) have developed a subspace clustering method of binary data that can be used in high - dimensional settings .",
    "bouguila ( 2010 ) has developed a clustering method for multivariate binary data with feature weighting that allows variable selection taking variables with large weights .",
    "recently , wu ( 2013 ) has proposed a penalized latent class model for clustering extremely large - scale discrete data .",
    "this method can be also considered a weighting method .",
    "cagnone and viroli ( 2012 ) have proposed a factor mixture analysis model for multivariate binary data , in which latent variables are distributed as a finite mixture of multivariate gaussian distributions .    in this paper , we focus on the common subspace clustering in which a cluster structure is present in a low - dimensional space .",
    "as described above , patrikainen and mannila s ( 2004 ) method allows for obtaining a cluster structure and a subspace for the cluster structure simultaneously . however , their method is rather cluster - specific subspace clustering .",
    "in addition , in the past few decades , because of technical advances in storing and processing data , we can obtain a large dataset that includes a large number of variables .",
    "thus , we need to take into account such high - dimensional data . in a high - dimensional setting ,",
    "weighting methods for high - dimensional data , such as those of bouguila ( 2010 ) and wu ( 2013 ) , may be promising because variables that have lower weights are suggested for exclusion from the model .",
    "however , their methods do not provide explicit low - dimensional representation of the data , which is useful for evaluating and interpreting the cluster structure .",
    "thus , in this paper , we propose a new method to simultaneously find a cluster structure of multivariate binary data and an optimal low - dimensional space for clustering .",
    "furthermore , our proposed method can deal with high - dimensional data .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : proposed_method ] , we propose a new method to cluster multivariate binary data with dimension reduction .",
    "section 3 describes an algorithm for the proposed optimization problem .",
    "section 4 is devoted to studying the working of the clustering method using artificial and real data examples",
    ". finally , we sum up our findings and set out directions for future expansion in section 5 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a random vector of @xmath1 binary variables .",
    "suppose there are @xmath2 latent ( unobservable ) classes in a population and let @xmath3 , @xmath4 , be an allocation variable that takes `` 1 '' if an observation belongs to class @xmath5 , and `` 0 '' otherwise .",
    "we write @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the allocation variable follows a multinomial distribution , i.e. , the probability that @xmath7 takes the value @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "given that an observation is in the @xmath5th latent class , the probability that the random vector @xmath11 takes the value @xmath12 , where each @xmath13 takes @xmath14 or @xmath15 , is represented as @xmath16 .",
    "the unconditional probability of the response @xmath17 when we do not know the latent class of the observation is @xmath18    here , we need to specify how the probability @xmath19 depends on parameters .",
    "we postulate that , given the latent class to which an observation belongs , the responses on the binary variables are independent : @xmath20 this assumption of _ conditional independence _ has been widely used in latent class modeling in sociology ( collins and lanza , 2010 ) , and is directly analogous to the assumption in the factor analysis model that observed variables are conditionally independent given the factors ( aitkin et al . , 1981 ) .    finally , to specify the model completely , we need to specify a set of parameters that define the conditional probability of @xmath21 , with the value of @xmath22 given .",
    "suppose that @xmath23 are mutually independent random variables that have the same distribution as @xmath11 , and the entries of @xmath24 are those realizations .",
    "we assume that , given the class @xmath5 , @xmath25 follows the bernoulli distribution with success probability @xmath26 .",
    "for the traditional latent class analysis model ( aitkin et al . , 1981 ) , we consider a parameter vector @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the logit transformation of @xmath26 .",
    "we define the inverse logit transformation @xmath29 .",
    "the success probabilities can be represented using the canonical parameters @xmath28 as @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the @xmath32th element of @xmath33 . the individual data - generating probability given",
    "the class then becomes @xmath34 with @xmath35 since @xmath36 .",
    "then , these representations lead to the compact form of the log likelihood as @xmath37    we aim to obtain a low - dimensional representation of binary data in which the true cluster structure exists .",
    "thus , we assume that canonical parameter @xmath28 has a low - rank representation as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and for some positive integer @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . here ,",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 denote a centroid for the @xmath32th variable , a component score of the @xmath5th cluster , and a loading value for the @xmath32th variable , respectively .",
    "we write @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "to guarantee identifiability , we require that @xmath50 has orthonormal columns .",
    "then the log likelihood can be written as @xmath51    here , to deal with the high - dimensional problem , we assume that most of the elements of the true @xmath52 are exactly zero .",
    "a sparse loading matrix implies variable selection in cluster analysis .",
    "that is , variables with non - zero loadings can be considered to contribute to a cluster structure in a low - dimensional space , whereas variables with zero loadings have no effect on the cluster structure .",
    "we propose to perform variable selection using the penalized likelihood with sparsity - inducing penalties .",
    "if @xmath53 and @xmath44 is observable , eq . ( [ eq : ll_theta_assumption ] ) is the log likelihood for @xmath1 logistic regression models .",
    "this connection with logistic regression suggests the use of the @xmath54 penalty to obtain a sparse loading matrix , as in the lasso regression ( tibshirani , 1996 ) .",
    "specifically , consider the penalty @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the @xmath57th column of @xmath52 and @xmath58 is a regularization parameter .",
    "the choice of values for @xmath58 will be discussed later .",
    "we obtain cluster components @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath50 and a sparse loading matrix @xmath52 by maximizing the following penalized log likelihood : @xmath61    we call this procedure the clustering of binary data with reducing the dimensionality ( clusbird ) .",
    "we can interpret penalized maximization as the device for generating a suitable optimization function , but not a realistic representation of the actual data - generating process .",
    "thus , in this sense , the conditional independence given the latent class for obtaining the likelihood in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ll_theta_assumption ] ) is assumed .",
    "a computational algorithm for solving the maximization problem is presented in the next section .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     we conducted the proposed clusbird method and tandem analysis with @xmath62 and @xmath63 using the snp data .",
    "a tuning parameter was determined by bic for both methods .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : snp_plots_f_a ] .",
    "we can see that the proposed method recovered the true ethnic populations perfectly .",
    "in contrast , tandem analysis provided a crude recovery of the populations .",
    "the tandem analysis , slpca , provided a bit sparse estimation of loading values , where only a few snps had large loading values for the first component and many snps had low loading values for the second component .",
    "although this sparse structure may provide easy interpretation for the estimated low - dimensional structure , the structure did not contain the true ethnic populations well .",
    "the proposed method provided a reasonably sparse structure of loading values . actually , all snps used for this analysis had some relation to detection of populations .",
    "thus , it is reasonable that all snps had large loading values .",
    "in addition , for the proposed method , almost all snps had high loading values for one component , resulting in easy interpretation of the low - dimensional structure .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a new procedure , called clusbird , for simultaneously finding the optimal cluster structure for multivariate binary objects and finding the subspace to represent the cluster structure .",
    "the proposed method can provide the weight for each binary variable , which indicates the contribution of the variable to the cluster structure .",
    "in general , tandem analysis for clustering objects with dimension reduction is likely to fail in finding the cluster structure .",
    "in fact , our numerical examples demonstrate the inability of tandem analysis to detect the cluster structure and subspace for the structure .",
    "those examples also show that our proposed method can provide a better cluster structure than tandem analysis .",
    "furthermore , from the examples , we found that our procedure can work well for data that had a mildly larger number of variables than the sample size .",
    "the proposed model can be considered an extension of the ordinary latent class analysis ( lca ) ( aitkin et al . , 1981 ) .",
    "however , the ordinary lca can not provide loading values for variables and a low - dimensional structure .",
    "also , lca may not provide an appropriate estimation with the moderately high - dimensional dataset we used in the numerical examples . from this point of view",
    ", the proposed method can provide useful insight for researchers .",
    "the proposed method can be extended to deal with various problems .",
    "for example , it is useful for the proposed model to deal with categorical variables , not just binary variables .",
    "in addition , the ordinary lca model is ready for multi - group analysis , the analysis with covariates , and analysis of repeated measures data ( collins and lanza , 2009 ) . using the formulation of lca",
    ", the proposed model can also contain those features .",
    "these could be interesting topics for further research .",
    "to obtain individual component scores , @xmath64 , we propose a two - step approach .",
    "first , we estimate all parameters , @xmath65 , @xmath52 , @xmath50 , and @xmath66 , in the clusbird model .",
    "then , we assume that a cluster structure of individuals is present in a low - dimensional space that is the same as that for the cluster center @xmath50 .",
    "that is , the estimated loading matrix @xmath67 and low - dimensional centroids @xmath68 also define the subspace for the individuals .",
    "thus , we consider the following post hoc model .",
    "suppose that @xmath31 ( @xmath69 ) follows the bernoulli distribution with success probability @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the logit transformation of @xmath72 .",
    "in addition , we assume that the canonical parameter @xmath71 has a low - rank representation @xmath73 where @xmath74 with @xmath75 . here , we write @xmath76 then , we obtain individual component scores by maximizing @xmath77 over @xmath78 .",
    "similar to the solution of @xmath50 in section 3 , the optimal @xmath78 can be obtained using the gp algorithm .",
