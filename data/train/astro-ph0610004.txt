    "since the discovery of nonthermal x - ray emission from the shell of supernova ( sn ) 1006 @xcite , the nonthermal x - ray emitting blast wave shock fronts of supernova remnants ( snrs ) have been considered as prime candidate sites for the cosmic - ray acceleration .",
    "thanks to the high - resolution , high - sensitivity detectors on board _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories , several snrs now show evidence for particle acceleration sites near the shock fronts . while the nonthermal x - ray emission is typically from localized regions near the shock front in young historical snrs ( e.g. , cas a , tycho , sn 1006 ) , nonthermal x - rays in some relatively `` older '' ( @xmath11 @xmath12 a few 10@xmath13 yr ) snrs dominate the entire face of the remnants ( g347.3@xmath00.5 and g266.2@xmath01.2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "each of the latter also contains a central compact object ( cco ) @xcite , a peculiar manifestation of isolated neutron stars ( nss ) found in near the center of only a handful of snrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently , using the archival _ asca _ data , torii et al .",
    "( 2006 , t06 hereafter ) discovered that the x - ray emission from a galactic shell - type radio snr g330.2 + 1.0 @xcite is dominated by nonthermal continuum over the entire snr with enhancements toward the boundary shell .",
    "the x - ray continuum was described by a power law ( pl ) model ( photon index @xmath8 @xmath2 2.8 ) , indicating the x - ray synchrotron emission from the shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "based on the distance of @xmath25 @xmath0 10 kpc @xcite , a sedov age of @xmath11 @xmath12 3000 yr was estimated , assuming the typical explosion energy ( @xmath14 @xmath2 10@xmath15 ergs ) and ambient density ( @xmath16 @xmath2 1 @xmath17 ) ( t06 ) .",
    "g330.2 + 1.0 appears to resemble g347.3@xmath00.5 and g266.2@xmath01.2 , but , unlike those two snrs , no central point source was found for g330.2 + 1.0 in the _ asca _ data ( t06 ) .",
    "we observed g330.2 + 1.0 with _",
    "chandra _ in order to perform a detailed study of the snr such as the spatially - resolved spectroscopy of the nonthermal x - ray emitting shell , which could not be performed with the low - resolution detectors of _ asca_. the other major goal was the search for a ns at the center of the snr , motivated by the fact that the other two nonthermal x - ray - dominated snrs , g347.3@xmath00.5 and g266.2@xmath01.2 , contain a cco .",
    "we report here the discovery of a pointlike source at the center of g330.2 + 1.0 , which shows characteristics similar to the known ccos . in this _ letter _ , we present the results from the analysis of x - ray emission from this new candidate cco .",
    "the results from the analysis of the snr are presented elsewhere ( park et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "snr g330.2 + 1.0 was observed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board _ chandra x - ray observatory _ in may 22 , 2006 as part of the guaranteed time observations program .",
    "g330.0 + 1.0 has an @xmath210@xmath18 angular size ( * ? ? ?",
    "it is heavily absorbed and dominated by nonthermal continuum in the hard x - ray band ( @xmath19 = 1 @xmath0 10 kev ) .",
    "we thus used the acis - i array to utilize its large field of view ( fov ) of @xmath217@xmath18 @xmath5 17@xmath18 and the relatively large collecting area in the hard band .",
    "the pointing was roughly toward the geometrical center of the snr .",
    "no strong variability was found in the background light curve .",
    "we corrected for the spatial and spectral degradation of the acis data caused by radiation damage , known as the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ; townsley et al .",
    "2000 ) , with the methods developed by townsley et al .",
    "( 2002a ) , before further standard data screening by status , grade , and energy selections .",
    "`` flaring '' pixels were removed , and the standard grades ( 02346 ) were selected .",
    "after the data reduction , the effective exposure was 49.5 ks .",
    "the overall snr spectrum is hard , and there are few source photons below @xmath19 @xmath2 1 kev .",
    "the central pointlike source , as discussed below , also shows a spectrum with nearly all source photons detected at @xmath19 @xmath20 1 kev .",
    "we thus extracted photons in the 1 @xmath0 7 kev band for the data analysis .",
    "( the upper bound of @xmath19 = 7 kev was chosen to avoid instrumental lines and the higher background rates at @xmath19 @xmath20 7 kev . )",
    "the broadband image of snr g330.2 + 1.0 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "we detect some @xmath220 pointlike sources within the snr boundary ( @xmath25@xmath21 radius ) . among these sources ,",
    "the one detected at the `` center '' of the snr is remarkable .",
    "this source is the brightest ( @xmath20.012 counts s@xmath7 ) among the sources detected within the snr shell ( all other sources are fainter by @xmath12 an order of magnitude . )",
    "the source position is nearly at the geometrical center of the snr : e.g. , only @xmath233@xmath22 southeast of the radio snr center ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "as we discuss below , this source appears to be a candidate ns associated with g330.2 + 1.0 .",
    "thus , we hereafter refer this object as the `` ns candidate '' .",
    "we note that the ns candidate uniquely stands out in the central region of the snr : e.g. , within @xmath21@xmath21 radius of the snr center , we find only one other source at @xmath245@xmath22 northeast of the ns candidate , which shows a soft spectrum and an optical counterpart and is thus most likely a foreground star .",
    "comparisons of the ns candidate radial profile with the acis psf at the source position show no evidence for an extended nebulosity , confirming the pointlike nature .",
    "the detected sky position of the source is ra(2000 ) = 16@xmath23 01@xmath24 3@xmath2514 , dec(2000 ) = @xmath051@xmath26 33@xmath18 53@xmath276 .",
    "it is detected within @xmath21@xmath21 off - axis on the acis - i2 , and thus the positional uncertainties are @xmath20@xmath273 ( @xmath290% c. l. ) @xcite .",
    "we designate this source as cxou j160103.1@xmath0513353 .",
    "we extracted the source spectrum ( @xmath2600 counts ) from a circular region with a radius of 2@xmath22 .",
    "the background spectrum was taken from a surrounding annular region ( the inner radius = 4@xmath22 and the outer radius = 15@xmath22 ) .",
    "the source spectrum was binned to contain a minimum of 15 counts per energy bin . for the spectral analysis of our cti - corrected data",
    ", we utilized the response matrices appropriate for the spectral redistribution of the ccd , as generated by townsley et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is continuum - dominated with no clear line features ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) . a single black - body ( bb ) model with @xmath1 @xmath2 0.49 kev can adequately describe the observed spectrum ( table  [ tbl : tab1 ] ) .",
    "the high foreground column ( @xmath28 @xmath2 2.5 @xmath5 10@xmath29 @xmath30 ) is consistent with that for the snr ( t06 , park et al . in preparation ) .",
    "alternatively , a pl model can fit the data , implying an extremely steep spectrum ( @xmath8 @xmath2 5 ) and a higher @xmath28 @xmath2 4.7 @xmath5 10@xmath29 @xmath30 . for completeness , we note that optically thin thermal plasma models ( @xmath31 ) may also describe the spectrum with @xmath1 @xmath2 0.95 kev .",
    "the fit , however , requires an unrealistically low metal abundance with a 90% upper limit of @xmath20.3 solar , which supports a continuum - dominated nature of the spectrum .",
    "the ns candidate shows no significant evidence of variability on time scales of @xmath21 @xmath0 7 hr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) . although our _ chandra _ observation was perfomed with the standard 3.24 s frame - time , which precludes the search for an ordinary pulsar - like periodicity ( @xmath9 @xmath32 1 s ) , we can attempt to search for a long periodicity of @xmath9 @xmath2 several seconds , typical for anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) @xcite .",
    "the acis time resolution of 3.24 s and the total exposure of @xmath250 ks allow us to search for pulsations in the @xmath33 @xmath0 0.15 hz range .",
    "we use the arrival times of the 603 photons ( of which @xmath2@xmath34% are expected to come from the source ) , recalculated to the solar system barycenter using the axbary tool .",
    "we used the @xmath35 test @xcite to search for periodic pulsations .",
    "we calculated @xmath35 for @xmath36 @xmath0 4 ( where @xmath37 is the number of harmonics included ) at @xmath38 equally spaced frequencies @xmath39 in the @xmath33 @xmath0 0.15 hz range .",
    "this corresponds to oversampling by a factor of about 20 , compared to the expected width of @xmath40 @xmath41hz of the @xmath42 peaks , and guarantees that we miss no peaks .",
    "the most significant peak was found in @xmath43 (= 29.5 , corresponding to the @xmath1095% significance level ) at @xmath44 ( @xmath45 s ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "if this corresponds to the actual period of the source , the pulsed fraction is @xmath10@xmath46 .",
    "however , we note that the statistical significance of the period is only marginal .",
    "if this period is simply due to the statistical fluctuation , we place a 3@xmath47 upper limit of @xmath1052% on the pulsed fraction , assuming sinusoidal pulse shape per period .",
    "follow - up observations with higher time resolution and better photon statistics will be essential to verify the suggested periodicity or to search for a different period .",
    "the sky position at the center of snr g330.2 + 1.0 and the high foreground column , which is consistent with that of the snr , make the ns candidate association with the snr highly plausible .",
    "there is no evidence for hour - scale variability that might be caused by orbital and/or stellar activities .",
    "we find no counterparts at other wavelengths .",
    "there is no radio ( 843 and 1415 mhz ) enhancement at the snr center @xcite , and the nearest cataloged radio pulsar ( psr b1558@xmath050 ) is @xmath236@xmath21 away . the nearest optical source ( usno b1.0 # 0384@xmath00529508 ,",
    "b = 16.92 , r = 15.08 ) is @xmath23@xmath277 off the ns candidate .",
    "considering the accuracy of both the x - ray and the optical positions ( @xmath320@xmath273 ) , this source is unlikely to be the optical counterpart of the ns candidate .",
    "the optical upper limit ( v @xmath10 21 ) then implies a large x - ray - to - optical flux ratio of @xmath48 @xmath20 9 , which supports the ns interpretation rather than a normal stellar or extragalactic object @xcite . the high absorbing column toward g330.2 +",
    "1.0 supports previously estimated distances of @xmath49 @xmath2 5 @xmath0 10 kpc . assuming that the ns candidate is associated with g330.2 + 1.0 , we scale the distance to the ns candidate in units of 5 kpc .",
    "the best - fit bb temperature of the ns candidate is higher than those expected from the standard cooling of the young ns s surface @xcite , but it is consistent with the temperature observed in ccos and/or axps @xcite .",
    "the small size of the implied bb radiating region , @xmath50 @xmath2 0.4 @xmath51 km ( where @xmath51 is the distance scaled to 5 kpc ) , is similar to that of other ccos ( pavlov et al .",
    "2000,2002 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , probably indicating the x - ray emission from a hot polar cap of the ns .",
    "the x - ray luminosity @xmath52 @xmath2 1 @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath53 ergs s@xmath7 is also consistent with the object being a cco ( pavlov et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .",
    "the pl model implies a higher @xmath28 than in the bb case and a very steep slope of the spectrum .",
    "these parameters resemble those of the ccos in the other two nonthermal x - ray snrs g347.3@xmath00.5 and g266.2@xmath01.2 @xcite .",
    "the higher column associated with the pl fit could suggest a background agn origin of the ns candidate , as perhaps suggested by the relatively high chance probability ( @xmath20.2 ) of such a detection within the snr boundary ( @xmath25@xmath21 radius ) based on the logn - logs relation in the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "however , the combination of the extremely steep x - ray spectrum ( @xmath8 @xmath2 5 ) , the high @xmath54 ratio , the absence of a radio counterpart , and the suggested possible pulsations strongly favor the case of a ns , making an agn interpretation highly unlikely .",
    "the ns candidate was not detected with _ asca _ ( t06 ) . the non - detection might be attributed to the low sensitivity ( e.g. , the gis count rate is @xmath230% of the acis - i at @xmath19 @xmath20 1 kev ) and the poor angular resolution ( @xmath23@xmath18 fwhm ) of _ asca_. in fact , the @xmath220 ks exposure of the archival _ asca _ data implied only @xmath270 photons per gis over the @xmath1210 arcmin@xmath55 source area . on the other hand",
    ", we serendipitously detected the ns candidate in archival _ xmm - newton _ data ( obsid 0201500101 ) . assuming a bb model with @xmath1 = 0.5 kev and @xmath28 = 2.5 @xmath5 10@xmath29 @xmath30",

    "the ccos are believed to be a peculiar manifestation of nss , whose nature is not fully understood . considering only a handful of the known ccos ,",
    "the discovery of this new candidate cco is important as it adds a new member to this class of nss .",
    "the association with a newly - discovered nonthermal snr g330.2 + 1.0 makes this new cco candidate particularly interesting because each of the other two nonthermal x - ray - dominating snrs also contains a cco .",
    "furthermore , the possible pulsations at @xmath9 @xmath2 7.5 s ( if confirmed ) , which is typical for axps , makes this object potentially even more intriguing , because only two of the known ccos show pulsations , both with shorter periods @xcite .",
