    "superconducting fluctuations have attracted a great deal of attention in the research of high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) .",
    "the first reason was the challenge of observing the critical regime of fluctuations , which had been previously inaccessible in experiments with classical low temperature superconductors . due to the short coherence lengths , and high thermal energy @xmath8 ,",
    "it was estimated from the ginzburg criterion that critical fluctuations in htsc could extend within 1  k , or more , around @xmath0.@xcite beyond the critical region , one expected a transition to gaussian fluctuations , which are the lowest order fluctuation correction to the mean field theory.@xcite indeed , critical fluctuations have been observed in htsc by a number of experimental techniques , including penetration depth measurements @xcite , thermal expansivity @xcite , two - coil inductive measurements @xcite , and microwave measurements.@xcite the experimental evidence was consistent with the 3d xy universality class .",
    "the 3d character implies that the fluctuation correlations extend over many atomic layers along the @xmath9 axis . even in strongly underdoped @xmath1 ( ybco ) ,",
    "which is extremely anisotropic , no evidence was found for the crossover to uncorrelated fluctuations in adjacent layers , i. e. the kosterlitz - thouless - berezinsky ( ktb ) vortex - unbinding transition@xcite until the thickness of the sample became comparable to the fluctuation correlation length . @xcite    the second reason for the study of superconducting fluctuations in htsc was related to the nature of the pseudogap , which is known to open in underdoped compounds at a temperature @xmath10 , much above the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0.@xcite the intriguing question was whether a highly sensitive experimental technique could detect the superconducting fluctuations extending as high above @xmath0 to almost reach the pseudogap temperature @xmath10 .",
    "observation of the superconducting fluctuations up to @xmath10 would indicate that the pseudogap is related to superconductivity .",
    "in such a scenario , the long - range coherence is lost at @xmath0 due to fluctuations of the phase of the superconducting order parameter.@xcite the pseudogap region would then be marked by preformed cooper pairs , and take the role of the precursor to the superconducting state . if , in contrast , one finds convincing experimental evidence that the onset temperature of the superconducting fluctuations falls well below @xmath10 , in particular for underdoped htsc , the nature of the pseudogap would appear to be unrelated to superconductivity .",
    "instead , it could be explained by fluctuations of other order parameters , as proposed on theoretical grounds.@xcite    experiments probing magnetic correlations have recently uncovered evidence of electronic liquid - crystal states , @xcite and/or orbital - current order @xcite in the pseudogap regime of underdoped htsc .",
    "the onset of these ordering phenomena was found to coincide with @xmath10 , as determined by the departure from linearity of the dc resistivity curve .",
    "however , the evidence presented in favor of new forms of magnetic order in the pseudogap region need not exclude the existence of some form of the superconducting order , or possible competition of the two.@xcite .",
    "the extent of the superconducting fluctuations has to be firmly established using a sensitive and reliable experimental technique .",
    "a major problem in most experimental techniques is to subtract properly a background signal unrelated to superconductivity .",
    "for example , when analyzing the nernst effect , one has to subtract the normal quasiparticle contribution,@xcite which may not obey the usual assumptions of the so - called sondheimer cancellation.@xcite furthermore , it has also been shown that spin / charge density modulations , known as stripe order in underdoped htsc , can cause a considerable contribution to the observed nernst signal.@xcite the conclusions on the extent of the superconducting fluctuations drawn from the nernst effect measurements are still controversial,@xcite and call for a complementary analysis by other experimental techniques",
    ".    early work on dc fluctuation conductivity in htsc relied on the assumption that the normal state resistivity was linear , not only at temperatures far above @xmath0 , but also closer to @xmath0 where the superconducting fluctuations appear.@xcite the linearly extrapolated resistivity was used to calculate the normal conductivity @xmath11 , which was then subtracted from the total experimental conductivity to obtain the fluctuation conductivity alone .",
    "however , it was later shown that the linear normal state resistivity was not generic to htsc , particularly not in underdoped compounds,@xcite so that deviations from linearity could not be unambiguously ascribed to superconductivity .    in microwave measurements",
    "one can determine the complex conductivity @xmath12,@xcite where the real part @xmath13 includes both the normal conductivity @xmath11 and the contribution from the superconducting fluctuations @xmath14 .",
    "separating those two parts poses the same problem as in the dc conductivity analysis .",
    "the imaginary part @xmath15 requires no subtractions , since it is entirely due to the appearance of superconductivity .",
    "however , it decays above @xmath0 much faster than the real part @xmath14 of the fluctuation conductivity,@xcite and may become untraceable due to the signal noise . in order to deal with the problem ,",
    "we have recently introduced a novel approach to microwave measurements in combination with an external magnetic field.@xcite the microwave signal measured in 8 t field was subtracted from the one in zero field , and the difference was reliably attributed to the contribution of the superconducting fluctuations above @xmath0 . in a nearly optimally doped @xmath16 ( hg1201 ) high quality single crystal@xcite with @xmath17 , we could observe the superconducting fluctuations up to @xmath18 , which is only 10 k above @xmath0 .",
    "this is far below the pseudogap temperature @xmath19 determined in this compound .    in this paper , we take advantage of the microwave technique combined with the magnetic field to study the superconducting fluctuations in ybco single crystals over a wide doping range . we have studied both overdoped and underdoped samples ( table [ tb1 ] ) . for a short notation",
    ", we name these samples od89 , ud87 , and ud57 .",
    "the experimental arrangement allows for the determination of the superconducting fluctuation conductivity separately in the @xmath20 plane , and along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "our results show that the region of superconducting fluctuations is fairly narrow . in the overdoped sample",
    ", it extends to only  7 k above @xmath0 , while in our most underdoped sample at most to  23 k , which falls far below the pseudogap at that doping .",
    "implications of these findings will be discussed .",
    "high - quality ybco single crystals were grown by the solution growth method in the crystal growth group at the max - planck - institut fr festkrperforschung stuttgart . in order to prepare samples with well - defined oxygen content",
    "the as - grown crystals were annealed in o@xmath21 ( od89 and ud87 ) and synthetic air ( ud57 ) respectively .",
    "the overdoped crystal was detwinned by application of uniaxial mechanical stress ( @xmath22",

    "the hole doping level per planar cu ion @xmath28 was extracted from the known doping dependence of the room - temperature thermoelectric power @xcite and the lattice parameter @xmath9 ( ref . ) .",
    "the width @xmath29 of the superconducting transition was estimated by the common 10 - 90 percent criterion of the transition curve measured by the microwave absorption described later in this paper .",
    "we may note that the same criterion applied in dc resistivity curves yields a smaller transition width .",
    "this comes out naturally because of the nonzero losses in microwave measurements even below @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the present estimate of @xmath29 is a rather conservative one .",
    "the precise value quoted for @xmath0 is not the simple midpoint in the transition curve measured by the microwave absorption , but was infered from the maximum of the real part @xmath13 of the complex microwave conductivity as shown later in section v. this value of @xmath0 was found to lie within the @xmath29 range , somewhat closer to the lower ( 10 percent ) boundary .    for the microwave measurements ,",
    "the sample was mounted on one end of a sapphire holder , which serves as a cold finger .",
    "the assembly was then inserted into the microwave cavity so that the sample takes the center position inside . outside of the microwave cavity ,",
    "a heater - sensor block was mounted on the free end of the sapphire holder .",
    "the temperature could be controlled to 10 mk stability .",
    "the microwave cavity was made of copper so as to allow measurements in any external magnetic field with only a small change in its @xmath30-factor .",
    "this small field dependent variation could be detected by measuring the empty cavity , and subtracted from the signal measured when the cavity was loaded with the sample .",
    "the geometry of the microwave cavity was carefully chosen as elliptic , so that the degeneracy of some orthogonal modes could be lifted .",
    "we used @xmath31 , and @xmath32 modes operating at 13.14 ghz , and 15.15 ghz , respectively .",
    "each of these modes has an antinode of the microwave magnetic field @xmath27 in the cavity center , where the sample is positioned .",
    "however , the polarization of @xmath27 is along the cavity axis in the @xmath32 mode , and perpendicular to this axis in the @xmath31 mode .",
    "thus , with the same mounting and positioning of the sample in the cavity , we could carry out two measurements .",
    "we chose to mount the ybco single crystal so that its @xmath9 axis was along the cavity axis ( vertical in our experimental setup ) .",
    "consequently , the induced microwave currents in the measurement with the @xmath32 mode were flowing as closed loops in the @xmath20 plane , while the @xmath31 yielded microwave currents closing the loops by flowing partly in the @xmath20 plane , and partly along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "the polarizations of @xmath27 , and the induced current loops in the two respective modes are shown in the insets of figs .",
    "[ slikaop ] and [ slikaud ] .",
    "the microwave source was a rohde schwarz synthesizer whose frequency could be tuned to achieve resonance .",
    "an afc circuit allowed tracking of the resonance as the temperature of the sample was swept , and the resonant frequency was measured by a microwave counter . on top of that , the microwaves were frequency - modulated at 991 hz , with a frequency deviation which corresponds to the halfwidth of the lorentzian representing the resonance curve of the microwave cavity loaded with the sample .",
    "even harmonics of the output signal from the microwave cavity were used to determine very accurately the @xmath30-factor of the cavity .",
    "the details of this method were published elsewhere.@xcite    data acquisition was made during a slow temperature sweep of the sample so that the microwave signal generator could alternate between the resonance frequencies of the two modes .",
    "thus , we obtained the experimental curves in both modes with a single temperature sweep .",
    "this procedure ensures that the resulting data can be directly compared .",
    "the results of microwave measurements are expressed through a change in the inverse value of the quality factor of the cavity loaded with the sample . in our experimental setup",
    ", the microwave cavity is kept always at a constant low temperature ( e. g. 2  k ) so that the power dissipation in its walls remains unchanged .",
    "the contribution of the unloaded cavity , @xmath33 , is subtracted from the total experimental value @xmath34 to obtain the contribution due to the sample itself @xmath35 . as the temperature of the sample is varied , one observes changes of @xmath36 as the absorption of microwaves is changed within the skin depth of the sample surface .      in order to extract the contribution of the superconducting fluctuations from the overall signal , we have carried out measurements in zero magnetic field and in ( dc ) magnetic fields up to 16 t.",
    "the behavior of the superconducting fluctuations in applied magnetic fields has been previously studied by dc conductivity measurements,@xcite and compared to theoretical predictions.@xcite also , microwave conductivity measurements were used for studying the scaling properties in field and temperature.@xcite in contrast to those studies , here we do not aim to study the superconducting fluctuations in various applied fields , but apply a high enough field in order to suppress superconductivity at all temperatures above the zero field @xmath0 .",
    "this serves us to determine the normal state background line without any extrapolation based on a theoretical model of the normal state behavior . in section",

    "the superconducting transition is shifted to a lower temperature , and occurs through the formation of the mixed state with some magnetic flux penetrating into the sample .",
    "the microwave currents then exert a lorentz force on vortices so that their oscillation constitutes an additional mechanism of the microwave power absorption.@xcite    the measurements shown in figs .",
    "[ slikaop](a ) and ( b ) were carried out in the two modes as described in section ii .",
    "note that the signal in the normal state is considerably larger when @xmath27 is parallel with the @xmath20 plane ( fig .",
    "[ slikaop](b ) ) .",
    "the explanation can be found if one observes that , in this configuration , the induced current flows in a closed loop , partly in the @xmath20 plane and partly along the @xmath9 axis . since the ratio of the normal state values @xmath41 and",

    "it is useful to quantify this statement by analyzing the data in fig .",
    "[ slikaop](a ) .",
    "the total signal @xmath36 above @xmath0 is in the range 40 - 50 ppm , whereas our noise level in that temperature range is about 0.2 ppm .",

    "a typical value for slightly underdoped ybco at 100 k is about 100 @xmath48cm,@xcite so that our method is sensitive to resistivity changes greater than 1 @xmath48 cm . within this limit",
    ", we observe no magnetoresistance in fields up to 16 t in the normal state above 100 k in nearly optimally doped ybco .",
    "we note , however , that the transverse and longitudinal dc magnetoresistance of magnitude @xmath49 has been observed up to @xmath50 k over a wide range of underdoped ybco.@xcite the small longitudinal magnetoresistance at high temperatures was ascribed to magnetic scattering which increases when the spin gap is suppressed by the zeeman effect , while a much larger magnetoresistance closer to @xmath0 was ascribed to the superconducting fluctuations .",
    "orbital magnetoconductivity in the normal state at higher temperatures was fitted very well with the @xmath51 dependence , while an upturn from this behavior was observed only when it reached the magnitude @xmath52 at temperatures about 20 k above @xmath0 .",

    "however , it is worth mentioning here that the measurements of the far - infrared ( fir ) optical conductivity can probe the electron system at much higher frequencies.@xcite by considering the temperature dependence of the optical spectral weight , a recent fir study in deeply underdoped ybco ( similar to our ud57 sample ) has uncovered possible evidence for superconducting fluctuations up to temperatures as high as 180 k.@xcite the result was obtained using a multilayer model of the @xmath9-axis electrodynamics , which separates the local intra- and inter - bilayer conductivity in ybco . only the intra - bilayer conductivity was found to develop precursor conductivity at elevated temperatures .",

    "one may recall that neutron scattering experiments on underdoped ybco have revealed spin correlations well above @xmath0 with fluctuation rates in the thz range.@xcite these spin correlations also develop a characteristic in - plane anisotropy , which has been interpreted in terms of an electronic transition into a nematic liquid state .",
    "this process may be related to the intra - bilayer anomalies observed in fir measurements .    on the other hand",
    ", microwave @xmath9-axis conductivity can detect sc fluctuations capable of forming long range inter - bilayer correlations .",
    "this can be further confirmed by comparing the samples with higher doping levels , where the correlations extend in the same temperature range when detected by both , microwave and fir techniques .",
    "namely , for the optimally doped and overdoped cuprates , model calculations @xcite show that the phase stiffness is more rigid ( @xmath69 ) , so that the transition to the normal state is expected to occur through the disappearance of the amplitude of the order parameter .",
    "hence , above @xmath0 the superconducting fluctuations would preserve phase correlation as long as there is some amplitude present , i. e. amplitude fluctuations alone can not be expected on theoretical grounds .",
    "the present measurements in our slightly underdoped ( ud87 ) and overdoped ( od89 ) samples have detected the superconducting fluctuations in the range of 7 - 8 k above @xmath0 , which is a considerably shorter range than the one observed in the deeply underdoped ( ud57 ) sample , but does not reduce to the narrow range characteristic of classical superconductors .",
