    "dune morphology has been investigated over the last fifty years by scientists from different research areas like geologists , geographers , physicists and even mathematicians , since the pioneering work of @xcite .",
    "although a theoretical explanation for the wide variety of observed dune forms is still lacking , it is well known that the behaviour of the wind as well as sand availability are fundamental parameters for determining the final dune shape .",
    "on bedrocks and surfaces with not too much sand and under uni - directional winds , barchan dunes move separated from each other , without changing their shape and with a velocity inversely proportional to their height .",
    "these dunes have a windward side and a steep slip face where avalanches take place maintaining dune stability and motion . as the amount of available sand increases ,",
    "`` barchanoids '' are found , which look like oscillating chains of barchans joined at their horns , aligned perpendicularly to the wind direction . for higher sand supply ,",
    "transverse dunes are observed .",
    "transverse dunes cover 40@xmath0 of all terrestrial sand seas , being common in the northern hemisphere , particularly in china , and dominating the dune fields on mars . normally transverse dunes have more irregular patterns and even hierarchies of smaller dunes can be found on them .",
    "transverse dunes have been studied in the field many times @xcite , but still most of these works are restricted to desert dunes .",
    "dunes appear very commonly along coasts @xcite .",
    "the sand that constitutes these dunes comes from the sea being thereafter deposited on the beach .",
    "once the grains are exposed to the air , they dry and some can be carried by the wind , initiating sand transport .",
    "coastal dune development is a result of the complex interplay of several factors like the type of sediment , the sand influx , and the presence of vegetation .",
    "important aspects for coastal dune formation are the topography of the area , the wave climate and , on a larger scale , sea level @xcite . with heights that can vary between a few meters to over 30 m ,",
    "dunes represent not only tourist attraction in coastal zones , but they also work as barriers against waves , act as sand reserve for beaches and protect the land behind them from erosion and salt intrusion . understanding the morphology and dynamics of coastal dunes is thus of interest also for federal , state , and local government units responsible for the protection and management of coastal dune areas @xcite .    for strong unidirectional winds blowing from the sea onto the continents ,",
    "transverse dunes appear along the coasts , moving landward .",
    "barchanoids and transverse dunes extending over several kilometers form the characteristic pattern of the biggest coastal dune field in brazil , known as `` lenis maranhenses '' @xcite .",
    "such scenario is typical of _ transgressive _ dune fields @xcite , which appear on high energy beaches experiencing high littoral drift . in this work",
    ", we present field measurements performed on a sequence of transverse dunes situated at the beginning of the lenis maranhenses .",
    "the height profile of seven transverse dunes was measured and compared with numerical simulations using a dune model in two dimensions @xcite , where in the present work a phenomenological relation for the separation bubble has been introduced to the model , based on the field data for interdune spacing as a function of the dune height and crest shape .",
    "the national park of the lenis maranhenses , also known as the `` brazilian sahara '' , is located on the coastal area of the maranho state , in northeastern brazil ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mapa ] ) , delimited by the coordinates s @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and w @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "it has a total area of 155 thousand hectares , and a coast of a length of 50 km , along which strong winds , reaching velocities of 70 km / h , transport sand from the atlantic ocean onto the continent .",

    "s. ]    the area of the `` lenis '' ( or ` sheets ' in portuguese ) is mainly characterized by the presence of barchanoids and transverse sand dunes separated in the rainy season by lakes and lagoons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : barchanoide ] ) .",
    "the area has a semi - humid tropical climate , with little vegetation .",
    "the local temperatures are typically 30 to @xmath5c , with annual rain between 1500 mm and 2000 mm , which is an amount quite different from the mean rainfall in desert areas ( in general less than 250 mm ) .",

    "[ fig : rain ] . in the first months of the year",
    ", high rainfall makes sand transport difficult , thus implying low dune mobility .",
    "a large fraction of the interdune lakes formed in this period disappear in the dry season",
    ". the landscape of the dune field appears to change continuously , indeed dune mobility implies that the lakes often reappear in different places with different contours .",
    "the lowest rainfall indices in the studied area refer to the period between august and november .",

    "it is situated in the vicinity of atins , a small village in the maranho state ( ma ) , just 1 km from the sea .",
    "these dunes have a height of typically 10 m and are closely spaced , separated by a few meters only , on a dense sand sheet in the beginning of the lenis maranhenses .",
    "they may be classified as `` transgressive dunes '' , which are defined in most of the cases as dunes that _ develop _ on sand sheets @xcite .",
    "near to the transverse field , several small barchans and barchanoids are found , with heights @xmath6 cm @xmath7 1 m. these smaller dunes emerge on a flat surface covered with less sand , extending from the beach up to the transverse dune field , as shown in fig .",

    "the size difference between the two neighbouring dune groups is clearly visible .",
    "the dune field studied here represents the genesis of the lenis , where the characteristic transverse profile originates .",
    "the dark areas in fig . [ fig : field](b ) correspond to low vegetation , called `` mangues '' .",
    "the coastal zone near atins is also characterized by a high concentration of plants developed on parabolic dunes of different sizes .",
    "vegetation appears due to humidity from the ocean and interdune lakes , and grows during the wet seasons , appearing also , although more rarely , on some parts of transverse dunes .    in the next section we present the results of our measurements . in section 4",

    "comparison of the results of our simulations with the measured profile and discussions are presented in section 5 .",
    "finally , in section 6 we present our conclusions .",
    "a tachimeter was used to measure the height variations at 77 different points along the surface of the dunes , which define a profile with a length of almost 720 m , as shown in fig .",

    "our measurements have error estimates of @xmath11 m for the height coordinate and @xmath12 m for the horizontal axis .",

    "[ fig : profile ] we identify in columns 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 , respectively : the dune height at the crest , @xmath17 , the height at the brink , @xmath20 , the crest - brink distance @xmath21 , the windward side length @xmath18 and the aspect ratio @xmath16 .",

    "it is surprising that although the dunes have more or less the same height , the position of the brink with respect to the crest , @xmath21 , varies strongly .",
    "this is in strong contrast with the situation of single barchans , for which it has been observed from field measurements in southern morocco that the brink gets closer to the crest for higher barchan dunes @xcite . in addition",
    ", differences between small and large barchans have been recently reported by @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite have more generally identified two kinds of barchan dunes : the `` slim '' and `` fat '' barchans , where the latter dunes may have been the more `` morphologically complex and areally larger dune masses '' formed by coalescence and fusion , and behave in a different way as the slim ones . @xcite",

    "this dune has a height @xmath43 m measured from the foot of its slip face up to the crest , and the length of its windward side is approximately 100 m. we placed an anemometer at a height of 1 m over the ground , and the registered wind velocity was averaged over time intervals of 10 min .",
    "an average wind velocity of @xmath44 m/s was registered at the brink of the dune ( point `` a '' ) .",
    "then , we moved the anemometer to a point at about the middle of the windward side ( point `` b '' ) , and the average wind velocity registered there was @xmath45 m/s .",
    "a second anemometer , placed at one point outside of the dune field , at about 10 m from the transverse dunes on a sand sheet where a field of small barchans developed close to the ocean , registered an average wind velocity of @xmath46 m / s , also at a height of 1 m. we did not measure the wind velocity at different heights over the ground , and thus we could not estimate the shear velocity @xmath47 and the aerodynamic roughness @xmath48 of the surface .",

    "initially , the traps were placed with their back showing in the wind direction .",
    "then , they were simultaneously turned to align their openings with the wind direction and sand was collected , in a similar way as in @xcite . from the mass @xmath62 of the collected sand , the width @xmath63 of the opening and the time @xmath64 necessary to fill the traps , we calculated the sand flux @xmath65 , for which we use @xmath66 , with @xmath67 cm and @xmath68 kg / m@xmath69 .",

    "a rigorous treatment of our measurements of sand flux would require reference to a recent work on sampling efficiency of a vertical array of aeolian sand traps @xcite .",
    "since we have only two measurement points for wind and flux , we report here the measured values but in this work we do not show comparison with model predictions for these data .",

    "@xmath87 is the undisturbed logarithmic profile ( [ eq : log_profile ] ) calculated at height @xmath88 , which is given by @xmath89 and normalized by the velocity at a reference height @xmath90 , which separates the middle and upper flow layers defined in the model by @xcite .",
    "it has been verified from simulations that an open system of transverse dunes seems to reach lateral invariance under unidirectional wind @xcite .",
    "although this observation is not strictly valid in the field due to the multi - directional nature of secondary airflow patterns @xcite , the assumption yields to important advantages in transverse dune field calculations .",
    "thus , for modelling transverse dune fields , as opposed to the situation of barchan dune modelling @xcite , we neglect the @xmath81-coordinate and consider height profile variations in the @xmath40 direction only , since much less computational time is consumed in this case , and larger dune fields can be simulated . in this way",

    "the steady state is assumed to be reached instantaneously , since it corresponds to a time scale several orders of magnitude smaller than the time scale of the surface evolution .",
    "thus , time - dependent terms are neglected .",
    "furthermore , the velocity @xmath101 of the grains in the saltation layer is modelled through the following equation : @xmath108 where : @xmath109 and @xmath110 . in eq .",

    "it has to be emphasized that these values have not been obtained from measurements on the field studied in the present work .",
    "of course , a detailed quantitative description of the sand flux and wind velocity over the transverse dunes investigated here would require more field data .",
    "furthermore , the shape and dynamics of dunes may be strongly influenced by the sorting and size distribution of grains , which is in general heterogeneous rather than well defined at one single size , and is also related to the dune s age @xcite . in our model ,",

    "the length of the separation bubble is thus of major importance for interdune spacing .",
    "we observed in the field that the net interdune sand flux in the wind direction was zero from the foot of the upwind slip face up to the beginning of the windward side of the downwind dune .",

    "simulations and measurements of surface shear stress over transverse dunes in a wind tunnel @xcite have reported similar reattachment lengths for such sharp crested dunes . in a recent work , the profile of the wind over the transverse dunes studied here has been calculated using fluent @xcite .",
    "it was shown in this work that there is in fact a strong dependence of the length of the separation bubble with the shape of the dune at its crest , where dunes with a large crest - brink distance , i.e. very round dunes , almost do not show recirculating flow at its lee side .",
    "moreover , @xcite have noticed differences in the behaviour of the streamlines , flow expansion and deposition for sharp crested dunes in relation to the rounded ones .",
    "the observations above lead to the conclusion that simply considering the length of the streamlines as proportional to the height at the brink is not reasonable for modelling transverse dunes , and that the observed dependence of the interdune spacing on the crest - brink distance of the dunes has to be taken into account .",
    "since in our model the net sand flux is set to zero in the separation bubble , the observed interdune distances define an upper bound for the reattachment length .",
    "if we choose a larger length for the bubble in our model , simulation of closely spaced transverse dunes as the ones measured here is not possible @xcite .",
    "the linear relation between the interdune spacing and the distance @xmath159 between the crest and the brink , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : interdune_distances ] , suggests that , if the horizontal distance between brink and crest is described by a parabola of the form @xmath160 , then in a first approximation we could define the distance from the crest to the reattachment point to follow also a quadratic relation @xmath161 .",
    "this relation is then used to determine the point of reattachment @xmath162 of the separation bubble , @xmath163 . in order to give an insight into the meaning of the parameter @xmath164",
    ", we notice that for a dune with height @xmath165 m at its crest , a value of @xmath166 gives @xmath167 m , while @xmath168 leads to @xmath169 m.    in our previous work , the streamlines of the separation bubble were fitted by a third order polynomial , @xmath170 , whose parameters were calculated from the continuity conditions of the profile @xmath171 at the brink of the dune and at the reattachment point , as well as of @xmath172 at the brink .",
    "moreover , the third order polynomial was calculated in such a manner that the separation bubble does nt descend steeper than @xmath173 @xcite .",
    "this leads to large values of the horizontal distance from the brink up to the reattachment point , @xmath174 being typically between 6 and 10 times the dune height . using higher order polynomials to take into account",
    "the relation observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : interdune_distances ] , on the other hand , makes the streamlines descend too fast close to the brink at the lee side , making the curvature of the separation bubble different from that of the dune surface at the brink , thus giving rise to inconsistencies in the calculation of the shear stress with eq .",
    "( [ eq : shear_stress_perturbation ] ) for smooth hills @xcite , and consequently of the sand flux .",
    "therefore we define a modified separation bubble as @xmath175 for @xmath176 and @xmath177 \\times { \\left\\{1-\\tanh{\\left[(x - r)/{{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{c}}}\\right]}\\right\\}}/2 + h({x_{\\mathrm{reat } } } ) , \\label{eq : sepbub}\\ ] ] for @xmath178 , where @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 determines the slope of the streamlines at point @xmath138 , and @xmath182 is a parameter between 0 and 1 , which determines the point at which the original polynomial is multiplied by the function @xmath183 .",

    "( [ eq : sepbub ] ) gives a shorter separation bubble from the _ original _ function @xmath185 .",
    "it keeps the slope of the original separation bubble close to the brink , and presents a steeper descent to the reattachment point .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ eq : sepbub ] ) is a simple approximation of the original separation bubble introduced in @xcite to study closely spaced transverse dunes , based on the phenomenological observations reported in the present work .",
    "we set @xmath186 , which gives a distance of 25 m from the crest of dune 3 up to the reattachment point at its lee side , and @xmath181 and @xmath182 are set to @xmath11 and @xmath187 respectively .",
    "studies of the separation bubble of _ isolated _ transverse dunes have shown that the separation streamlines may be well described by an elliptical curve , but still separation distances only larger than 4 times the dune height were found , and no mention has been made to closely spaced transverse dunes in a field . besides this , we report in the present work larger crest - brink distances than the ones of the dunes studied in @xcite .",
    "simulations using our model with the separation bubble lengths calculated in @xcite would yield much more widely spaced transverse dunes than the ones investigated here .",
    "an extension of this work for transverse dune fields with dunes of different heights and crest - brink distances could yield more precise knowledge of the separation streamlines of closely spaced dunes .",

    "the numerical model described above has been used in @xcite to study transverse dune formation on a sand bed completely filled with sand . as mentioned before ,",

    "fig : simulation ] that the distance between crest and brink for the simulated transverse dunes of similar heights varies strongly as in the case of the measured dunes .",
    "this striking observation appears to be a consequence of the interaction between transverse dunes in a field .",
    "barchans behave more like isolated dunes and exchange less sand than a field of closely spaced transverse dunes .",
    "simulations in @xcite have shown that the brink position of transverse dunes is in general closer to the crest if the dune is downwind of another one .",
    "such sharp crested dunes with `` triangular '' cross - section are found in our simulations during the evolution of the field , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation](c ) .",
    "however , they appear only when interacting with another dune like solitary waves , a feature that can be ilustrated comparing figs . [",
    "fig : simulation](c ) and ( d ) . in order to investigate dune interaction in more detail",
    ", transverse dunes have to be still systematically studied as done recently for barchan dunes @xcite .",
    "the typical dune shape found in our simulations is the `` rounded '' one , i.e. where the brink is clearly distinguishable from the crest .",
    "@xcite has shown that the ` rounded ' dunes are ` _ more stable _ ' than the ` triangular ' ones , since the sharp - crested shape experiences strong flux at the brink .",
    "we have found such peaks of sand flux when trying to simulate the evolution of triangular transverse dunes with our model , and we have seen that they lose this shape after some iterations , becoming ` round ' . on the other hand , we could not find dunes with the ` triangular ' shape in our simulations of dune fields , but those interacting like solitary waves , as mentioned above .",
    "however , we do not conclude from this that the measured sharp crested dunes found in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] should be interacting like solitary waves with their neighbours .",
    "we remark that our model assumes lateral invariance , from which the profile variations found for these dunes in the @xmath81 direction , as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : field ] , are not included and , consequently , variations in the lateral shear stress are not considered , which could influence the dune shape at the brink . in spite of this limitation ,",
    "the variable crest - brink distances found in the field have been captured by the model .",
    "also , the separation bubble in our model is the region of zero flux downwind , which implies that the observed interdune distances provide an upper bound of the separation length . to use a longer bubble , our model",
    "could be improved in order to capture the complexity of the wind and flow in the bubble @xcite .",
    "possibly , in this case , sharp crested dunes could be found in simulations of closely spaced transverse dunes .",
    "the shape of coastal dunes like the ones investigated here may be influenced by standing water and vegetation in the interdune area , which could be relevant to the lee face steepness and crest - brink separation distances .",
    "recently , an extension of our model to simulate barchan dunes with vegetation has successfully reproduced the observation that these dunes transform into parabolic dunes @xcite , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "the study of coastal transverse dune field formation in the presence of vegetation and lagoons is the subject of further work .",
    "we have performed field measurements of the height profile of transverse dunes in the lenis maranhenses , northeastern brazil , and compared the results with the predictions of a two - dimensional dune model recently introduced .",
    "the model separation bubble at the lee side of the dune was adapted in order to match the observation that the interdune spacing in the measured field is less than 4 times the dune height at the brink .",
    "the shape of transverse dunes was found to vary with their height in a different way than in the case of barchan dunes .",
    "while larger barchans present their crest closer to their brink than smaller ones , the crest - brink distance was found to be independent of the height for transverse dunes .",
    "moreover , we found that the windward side of all dunes could be superposed in such a way to form a nearly parabolic shape with common maximum point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : parabola ] ) , independently of the relative position of the brink for each particular dune . based on",
    "the relation observed for the interdune distances as a function of the brink position , we defined the reattachment length at the dune lee side to simulate transverse dune fields similar to the measured one .",
    "our model successfully reproduces the aspect ratio of the measured dunes , interdune distances and the appearence of variable crest - brink distance , assuming lateral invariance of the profile , which allows considerable simplifications of the model and simulations in two dimensions . in order to consider the oscillations in the profile in the @xmath81 direction , as fig .",
    "[ fig : field](b ) shows , three dimensional simulations are required to take into account the lateral shear stress @xcite , which could of course influence the dune shape for instance at the brink .",
    "the simulated dunes compared with the measured ones appeared ` rounded ' , and we have discussed possible explanations for this .    finally , a small field in the beginning of a growing structure of transverse dunes was measured which characterizes the pattern of the lenis maranhenses , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : field](a ) . we have simulated a transverse dune field that evolved on a sand sheet , thus a `` transgressive '' dune field @xcite .",
    "one aspect our model did not take into account is the proximity of the water line to the surface due to the rainfall in this region and the eventual role of standing water or vegetation , which may exert a major influence on the dune shape , although in the dry seasons water is practically absent from the sand sheet where the measured transverse dunes were found .",
    "comparison of our field data with further field measurements on transverse dunes in the lenis maranhenses as well as in other areas with different climate and geological conditions could , thus , be of importance for better understanding formation and evolution of transverse dune fields .",
