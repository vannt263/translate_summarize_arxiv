    "the current experimental and theoretical studies of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite have attracted a great deal of interest to nonlinear patterns which can exist in them , including dark @xcite and bright @xcite solitons .",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) excitations in the form of vortices were also realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "other nonlinear excitations , such as faraday waves @xcite , ring dark solitons and vortex necklaces @xcite were predicted to occur in becs .",
    "the behavior of the condensate crucially depends on the sign of the atomic interactions : dark ( bright ) solitons can be created in becs with repulsive ( attractive ) interactions , resulting from the positive ( negative ) scattering length .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated that `` tuning '' of the effective scattering length , including a possibility to change its sign , can be achieved by means of a feshbach resonance @xcite .    in this work",
    "we demonstrate that another type of localized nonlinear excitations , which may be regarded as dark solitons embedded in bright ones , can be created in attractive becs .",
    "they may also be considered as bound states of two bright solitons with a phase shift @xmath1 between them . in some respects ,",
    "we follow the path of very recent results of ref .",
    "these , in turn , were based on earlier works on the so - called twisted localized modes ( tlms ) in discrete systems @xcite ; that is why we apply the same term , tlm , to these solitons of the combined dark - bright type .",
    "tlms in a discrete system are bright solitons in which the field vanishes , changing its sign , at the central point . an alternative way to view",
    "a tlm is as a concatenation of an `` up - pulse '' ( i.e. , @xmath2 ) with a `` down pulse '' ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are appropriately separated , to form an up - down , two - pulse configuration .",
    "notice , however , that our work is essentially different from ref .",
    "@xcite , since we focus on the case of becs with _ negative _ scattering length ( such as @xmath6li @xcite and @xmath7rb @xcite ) , and demonstrate robustness and stability of tlms in the latter context .",
    "these structures , if regarded as effectively dark solitons in the attractive bec , are the inverse of recently predicted @xcite bright solitons in repulsive becs with an optical lattice .",
    "it is expected that a characteristic longitudinal length of the tlm soliton in physical units will be on the order of the wavelength of light which induces the ol , i.e. , @xmath8 @xmath9 m , and the number of atoms in the soliton may typically be @xmath10  @xmath11 .",
    "we consider a quasi-1d ( cigar - shaped ) bec with negative scattering length , the corresponding normalized gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation being @xcite @xmath12 u ,   \\label{tlmeq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the macroscopic wave function , @xmath14 measures the strength of the parabolic magnetic trap , and the last term accounts for the ol potential created by interference of two counterpropagating coherent light beams @xcite . as we consider only ( effectively ) 1d configurations , the attractive interactions between the atoms ( characterized by the negative scattering length ) can not produce collapse in the framework of the present model , hence various solitons have a chance to be stable .",
    "it is obvious that scaling invariance of eq .",
    "( [ tlmeq1 ] ) makes it possible to fix the optical wavelength , setting @xmath15 .",
    "this essentially means that all the remaining length scales of the problem are measured by comparison to the period of the optical lattice which has been fixed to @xmath0 .",
    "we follow this convention below .",
    "the number of atoms in the condensate , given by @xmath16 is a dynamical invariant of eq .",

    "we have checked that the boundary conditions do not significantly affect the results .",
    "the corresponding boundary - value problem was solved by means of a finite - difference discretization .",
    "a second order difference scheme with spacing @xmath20 was used to approximate @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting set of nonlinear algebraic equations was solved by means of a newton iteration .",
    "more details on finite - difference schemes and newton type methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "the solutions of interest were obtained by choosing , as the initial condition for the newton iterations , the following functional form : @xmath22 the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) approximates a superposition of nonlinear - schrdinger ( nls ) solitons .",
    "the presence of the ol suggests choosing positions of the solitons centers , @xmath23 , as @xmath24 , with some integer @xmath25 .",
    "the sign factor @xmath26 implies the phase difference @xmath1 between adjacent solitons .",
    "this choice of the phase pattern is suggested by the known result that , in the discrete nls equation , only such a configuration may be stable , see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "similar results for a bec model with elliptic - function potentials were obtained in ref .",
    "the number @xmath27 of solitons in the initial ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) was taken as @xmath28 , in order to find the tlm soliton proper , or @xmath29 , with the objective to find a bound state of two tlms , see below .",
    "however , it will become clear below that concatenating more of such `` building block '' structures ( such as the ones with @xmath28 or @xmath29 ) one can , in principle , construct multi - pulse configurations with a larger number ( @xmath27 ) of elementary pulses .    once tlm states were found as solutions to eq .",

    "( [ ab ] ) to o@xmath36 , one obtains the linearization problem as an eigenvalue problem where @xmath37 is the corresponding eigenfrequency , while @xmath38 ( where the @xmath39 denotes transpose ) , is the corresponding eigenfunction . using the same finite difference scheme as the one used for computing @xmath18 , we convert this to a matrix eigenvalue problem and find _ all _ the eigenvalues of the corresponding matrix .",
    "this is done by standard matrix eigenvalue solvers built into matlab @xcite .",
    "@xmath37 can , in general , be complex , i.e. , @xmath40 , where the subscripts denote the real and imaginary part of the eigenfrequency .",
    "if eigenfrequencies with non - zero imaginary parts exist , they lead to exponential instabilities , while their absence implies linear stability of the solution under consideration .",
    "this is monitored by the spectral plane pictures of the imaginary ( @xmath41 ) versus the real ( @xmath42 ) part of the eigenfrequency ( see e.g. , the bottom right panels of figs .",
    "[ tlmfig1]-[tlmfig3 ] below ) .",
    "the presence of even a single @xmath37 with @xmath43 implies instability . in all the cases",
    "when stable stationary solitons were identified according to this criterion ( see below ) , the stability was also checked and confirmed by direct simulations of the full equation ( [ tlmeq1 ] ) . for more details on the setup and solution of the eigenvalue problem ,",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite .    to systematically trace the evolution of numerically exact tlm solutions of eq .",
    "( [ tlmeq1 ] ) , we performed one - parameter continuations in the three - dimensional parameter space of eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) , @xmath44 .",
    "recall that we have set @xmath45 , hence @xmath46 is not a free parameter .",
    "we start by varying the ol - potential s strength @xmath47 for fixed @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we note that negative values of the chemical potential are typical of cases when the corresponding wave - function pattern is localized , although @xmath9 can sometimes be positive ( see below ) , which is explained by the presence of the ol potential in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) .",
    "numerical results corresponding to this case ( varying @xmath47 ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ tlmfig1 ] . in the top subplot of the upper part of the figure , the number of atoms in the soliton , defined as per eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) , is shown versus @xmath47 , and the largest instability growth rate , found from the associated linearized problem , is shown in the bottom panel of the upper part of fig .",
    "[ tlmfig1 ] ( zero instability growth rate implies that the soliton is stable ) .",
    "three characteristic examples of the tlm solution are displayed , together with their linear - stability eigenfrequencies , in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ tlmfig1 ] .",
    "this solution branch exists only for @xmath50 .",
    "the presence of this cutoff point is expected , as the optical lattice is crucial for the existence of tlm solutions , which are not found in the usual nls equation ( at least , in the absence of the parabolic - trap potential ) .",
    "nevertheless , below we will present a case in which a tlm / dark soliton solution is possible even in the absence of ol , being supported solely by the magnetic trap . in the interval @xmath51 , this soliton family is subject to oscillatory instability which is accounted for by the so - called hamiltonian hopf bifurcation @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the collision of two pairs of eigenvalues of opposite krein signature @xcite results in the generation of a quartet of genuinely complex eigenvalues .",
    "the strongest instability , with @xmath52 occurs at @xmath53 .",
    "similarly , we examined the evolution of the solutions , setting @xmath54 and @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) and performing continuation in @xmath14 , starting from @xmath48 . in this case too , oscillatory instability was found in a finite interval , @xmath55 . the maximum instability growth rate ( which is very large in this case ) is @xmath56 , and occurs at @xmath57 . the results for this case",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ tlmfig2 ] .    in these cases ,",
    "the oscillatory instability arises quite naturally .",
    "indeed , similar instabilities had been observed in the discrete counterpart of the system and , in fact , in the next section we will give a theoretical justification for their occurrence .",
    "another interesting numerical finding is that the tlm solutions appear to be much more robust than one would initially suspect . in particular , there seem to exist tlm solutions even when the ol has been almost completely smeared out by the harmonic trap ( see e.g. , the last panel of fig . [ tlmfig2 ] ) .",
    "we will return to this point in the following section .",
    "we also performed the continuation of the tlm solutions with respect to the chemical potential @xmath9 , which has yielded results displayed in fig .",
    "[ tlmfig3 ] . in this case ,",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath54 were chosen .",
    "the solutions exist in the region @xmath58 .",
    "the fact that the cutoff value @xmath59 is positive is explained by a contribution of the mean value of the ol potential @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) . in this case ,",
    "oscillatory instability is found in two finite intervals , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "complexes which may be considered as a bound state of two tlms , or simply as a concatenation of three fundamental solitons with phase difference @xmath63 between adjacent ones , were also studied . in this case , for symmetry purposes , @xmath64 in eqs .",
    "( [ tlmeq1 ] ) and ( [ v ] ) was replaced by @xmath65 ( recall we have set @xmath66 ) , and three pulses in the initial ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) were set at @xmath67 .",
    "we performed the continuation in @xmath14 , which has demonstrated that the bound state persists to very large values of @xmath14 , see fig .",
    "[ tlmfig4 ] .",
    "the branch becomes unstable , through a quartet of complex eigenfrequencies , at @xmath68 . a second instability , accounted for by another eigenvalue quartet , sets in at @xmath69 .",
    "this second oscillatory instability can be easily explained : as we argue below , for each pair of anti - phase pulses there exists a pair of eigenvalues with negative _ krein signature _",
    ", which is known to give rise to a hamiltonian hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "the strongest instability is found at @xmath70 , when the two instability growth rates are @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the first quartet returns to stability at @xmath73 , while the second quartet is stabilized for @xmath74 .",
    "the  bound states are _ completely stable _ for @xmath74 .      in the cases for which the tlm solitons or their bound states were found to be unstable ( due to the hamiltonian hopf bifurcations ) , we simulated nonlinear development of the instability in the framework of the full gp equation ( [ tlmeq1 ] ) .",
    "to this end , a finite - difference scheme with @xmath75 [ the same stepsize as in dealing with the stationary equation ( [ v ] ) ] was used , and time integration was performed by means of the fourth - order runge - kutta scheme with a time step @xmath76 .",
    "three examples of the evolution of unstable configurations are shown in fig .",
    "[ tlmfig5 ] .",
    "the two top ones correspond , respectively , to the strong and weak oscillatory instability of the tlm soliton . in both of these cases",
    ", the tlm state evolves into a single fundamental soliton .",
    "a difference between the two cases is that , in the former one , with the relatively weak ol , the newly formed soliton keeps moving between two minima of the potential , while in the latter case , which corresponds to a stronger ol , the fundamental soliton becomes pinned .",
    "finally , the bottom subplot of fig . [ tlmfig5 ] demonstrates that the oscillatory instability of a bound state of two tlm solitons transforms it into a single fundamental soliton with a large amplitude .",
    "the existence of the tlm state in the gp equation with ol can be explained , by means of perturbation theory , as a bound state of two fundamental solitons with phase difference @xmath1 between them .",
    "here , we consider the case of @xmath48 ( no parabolic trap ) , but the analysis can be easily generalized to include the trap . if the present model is considered as a perturbed nls equation , we can use an ansatz in the form of eq .",

    "this potential is realized as a part of the hamiltonian that depends on the coordinates @xmath78 and @xmath79 of the solitons and phase difference @xmath80 between them ( cf . a similar potential for solitons in the discrete - nls model found in ref .",

    "( [ equil ] ) and ( [ potential ] ) shows that a bound state of two solitons with @xmath83 , which corresponds to a tlm - like pattern , may exist if the separation @xmath84 between them exceeds the minimum value , @xmath85 .",

    "[ tlmfig6 ] we show the variation of @xmath86 with @xmath47 for @xmath66 and @xmath87 .",
    "the distance between the centers of the solitons was extracted from numerical data as the distance between two local maxima of @xmath88 , an inherent discretization error of @xmath89 being imposed by the finite - difference scheme .",
    "as is seen , the agreement between the theoretical prediction and the numerically approximated values of @xmath86 is quite good .    a more detailed analytical consideration of dynamical properties of a perturbed bound state ( following the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite ) shows that , within the framework of the present approximation , the bound state is stable .",
    "moreover , the existence of stable bound states of three fundamental solitons , which correspond to the bound state of two tlms considered above , can also be demonstrated by means of this approach .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) that the linearized equations for the perturbations defined in eq .",
    "( [ ab ] ) can be rewritten , in terms of new variables @xmath90 and @xmath91 , as @xmath92 the _ krein signature _ of the eigenvalue can be written as @xcite @xmath93 analytical consideration is possible for @xmath34 s that are real ; then @xmath94 and @xmath95 are also real , hence @xmath96 amounts to the expression @xmath97    as was done above , we approximate a tlm solution as a superposition , @xmath98 , of two stationary fundamental - soliton waveforms , positive @xmath99 and negative @xmath100 , the underlying assumption being a weak overlap between @xmath99 and @xmath100 . since @xmath101 and @xmath102 are , essentially , individual solitons , in the lowest - order approximation they obey equations @xmath103",

    "( [ keq6 ] ) ] .",
    "thus , in the lowest approximation , @xmath107 is a zero mode of the operator @xmath109 . in a similar way",
    ", the following approximate result can be obtained for the function @xmath110 : @xmath111    the linearization around each of the tlm - constituent pulses ( if considered in isolation ) carries a pair of zero eigenvalues due to the phase invariance .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunction , @xmath95 , has the shape of the pulse itself ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively ) .",
    "there is also a generalized eigenfunction @xcite for each pair .",
    "we expect to have two pairs of tlm eigenvalues originating from these pairs of the individual - soliton s ones , the corresponding eigenfunctions being ( in the lowest approximation ) @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the former one is related to the phase invariance of the system ( in other words , to the conservation of the total number of atoms ) , which means that the corresponding eigenvalue pair remains exactly equal to zero , while the other one may become different than zero . then , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ lpn ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ keq6 ] ) that , in the lowest approximation , @xmath114 . in turn ,",

    "( [ keq16 ] ) implies that the krein signature of this phase eigenmode is negative .",
    "a known consequence of this @xcite is that an oscillatory instability will be generated by collision of this nonzero eigenvalue with other discrete ones ( and/or those belonging to the continuous spectrum ) that carry a positive krein signature .",
    "the above consideration indicates that , for every pair of the interacting @xmath1-out - of - phase pulses , there exists an eigenvalue with negative krein signature and , consequently , a potentially ensuing hamiltonian hopf bifurcation .",
    "this conclusion fully agrees with our numerical results presented above , that have identified a single oscillatory instability for the single tlm soliton , and _ two _ such instabilities in the case of bound states of two tlm solitons .",
    "finally , it is possible to present analytical arguments justifying the existence of tlm solitons ( both single and multiple ones ) even when the harmonic trap is overwhelmingly stronger than the ol potential ( see the numerical results shown in the last panels in figs .",
    "[ tlmfig2 ] and [ tlmfig4 ] ) , or when the ol potential is simply absent . within the framework of the same perturbation theory which was employed above to derive eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , each of the pulses constituting the tlm state is then subject to the action of two forces .",
    "one of them is exerted by the magnetic trap , while the other comes from the interaction between the pulses .",
    "accordingly , the effective potential is @xmath116    predictions following from this approximation were tested against direct numerical results obtained in the absence of the ol , i.e. , with @xmath117 in eq .",
    "( [ tlmeq1 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ tlmfig7 ] , an example is displayed for @xmath118 and @xmath49 .",

    "the middle and bottom panels present a numerical solution , with maxima of @xmath88 at @xmath120 .",
    "thus , the perturbative approximation not only explains the existence of the tlm state in attractive becs even in the absence of ol , but also accurately predicts the location of centers of the pulses whose concatenation generates the tlm structure .",
    "this , in turn , supports the numerical findings  presented in section ii , which suggested that tlm solitons in the attractive bec would indeed persist even for very tight magnetic traps .",
    "thus , we conclude that the tlm solitons are a very robust feature of the system .",
    "in this work we have demonstrated that counterparts of twisted localized modes ( tlms ) , which were earlier found in the discrete one - dimensional nls equation , can exist as robust objects in attractive , effectively one - dimensional bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , provided that the condensate is confined by the optical lattice ( ol ) and/or parabolic magnetic trap .",
    "the tlms in becs may be considered as bound states of two fundamental solitons with a phase difference @xmath1 between them , or , alternatively , as a dark soliton embedded in a broader bright one .",
    "the family of the tlm solitons and their stability were investigated in detail , by means of numerical continuation in the strengths of the ol or magnetic - trap parameters , as well as in the chemical potential .",
    "stable bound states of two tlms , alias a bound state of three fundamental solitons with a @xmath0 phase shift between adjacent ones , were also found . in the cases when the tlms are unstable ,",
    "the development of the instability was monitored by means of direct simulations , with a conclusion that the tlm rearranges itself into a fundamental soliton .",
    "we have also developed an analytical approach , which treats each fundamental soliton as a quasi - particle subject to the action of effective forces exerted by the ol , magnetic trap , and interaction with another soliton .",
    "the analysis predicts the existence of the stable bound state of two fundamental solitons with a phase shift of @xmath1 between them .",
    "the smallest possible distance between the bound solitons , predicted by this approach , is in good agreement with the numerically found size of the corresponding tlm .",
    "the analysis can be readily extended to predict that multi - pulse bound states with the phase shift @xmath1 between adjacent solitons also exist and may be stable .",
    "the origin of the instability of the tlms , in the case when they are unstable , was also examined by means of an analytical approximation , and was found to stem from hamiltonian hopf bifurcations , which occur when eigenvalues with negative krein signature collide with positive - signature ones .",
    "this result was based on the existence of a negative - krein - sign eigenvalue set , that was constructed by means of the perturbative analysis .",
    "it will be very interesting to generalize these considerations to higher dimensions  in particular to two - dimensional settings . in that case",
    ", a relevant issue is the possible existence of a 2d counterpart of the tlm in the form of a bright vortex ( which was found in the 2d discrete nls equation , where it was shown to be stable under certain conditions @xcite ) .",
    "a very recent preliminary result is that bright vortices , stabilized by a 2d optical lattice , can indeed be found @xcite .",

    "<S> we demonstrate a possibility to generate localized states in effectively one - dimensional bose - einstein condensates with a negative scattering length in the form of a dark soliton in the presence of an optical lattice ( ol ) and/or a parabolic magnetic trap . </S>",
    "<S> we connect such structures with twisted localized modes ( tlms ) that were previously found in the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> families of these structures are found as functions of the ol strength , tightness of the magnetic trap , and chemical potential , and their stability regions are identified . </S>",
    "<S> stable bound states of two tlms are also found . in the case </S>",
    "<S> when the tlms are unstable , their evolution is investigated by means of direct simulations , demonstrating that they transform into large - amplitude fundamental solitons . </S>",
    "<S> an analytical approach is also developed , showing that two or several fundamental solitons , with the phase shift @xmath0 between adjacent ones , may form stable bound states , with parameters quite close to those of the tlms revealed by simulations . </S>",
    "<S> tlm structures are found numerically and explained analytically also in the case when the ol is absent , the condensate being confined only by the magnetic trap .    * dark - in - bright solitons in bose - einstein condensates with attractive interactions * </S>"
