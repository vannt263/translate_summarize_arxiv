    "a typical tunneling setting is the scattering process , where a wavepacket is reflected from and transmitted through a barrier higher than the incident particle energy . in this case ,",
    "the group delay @xcite , defined in terms of the energy derivatives of the reflection or transmission phase shift , describes the motion of the wave packet peak .",
    "it was also found that the group delay for particles tunneling through an opaque barrier is independent of the barrier width ( the `` hartman effect '' @xcite ) .",
    "the measurement of the time spent by a tunneling particle in the classically forbidden region can be based on the approach of baz and rybachenko @xcite , which uses the larmor precession of a particle with a magnetic moment in a weak magnetic field or in effective fields in solids due to the spin - orbit coupling @xcite . in classically forbidden regions",
    "there is not only precession but also a rotation @xcite of the moment into the direction of the field .",
    "bttiker and landauer @xcite analyzed tunneling through an oscillating rectangular barrier and found an interaction time which is closely related to the rotation of the magnetic moment in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "a tunneling time has been measured for electromagnetic waves passing through inhomogeneous optical structures @xcite and waveguides @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in graphene , a single layer of carbon atoms , which provides another example of massless particles , the transport occurs via evanescent waves , and the wigner - smith delay is _ linear _ in the tunneling distance @xcite .",
    "brouard , sala , and muga , using scattering theory projectors for to - be - transmitted / reflected wavepacket parts and for localizing the particle at the barrier , set a formal framework that unified many of the existing proposals pointing out that the multiple time scales correspond to different quantizations of the classical transmission time , due to the noncommuting observables and possible orderings involved @xcite .",
    "this clarified the meaning of different partitions of the dwell time into transmitted , reflected and interference components .",
    "another research line has been the investigation of characteristic times for the transient dynamics of the wave function ( e.g. the forerunners ) in a plethora of potential configurations and initial conditions using asymptotic methods @xcite . for specially prepared states ,",
    "in particular for confined or semiconfined initial waves with a flat density , these transients show diffraction in time @xcite , i.e. temporal oscillations reminiscent of spatial fresnel - diffraction by a sharp edge @xcite .",
    "also , the analysis of the partial density of states @xcite provides another approach to the understanding of the tunneling process .",
    "an important tunneling - dependent phenomenon is the decay of a metastable system @xcite , related , e.g. , to the state ionization in optics and to the discharging of a capacitor in mesoscopic physics @xcite .",
    "compared to the full scattering problem , the decay configuration , or `` half - scattering '' problem , has been frequently considered unproblematic because of the absence of the transmitted / reflected wavepacket splitting and the existence of a well known characterization in terms of resonance lifetimes .",
    "in fact , one may still pose classically minded questions on the tunnelling time similar to the ones in the scattering configuration , however , without obvious answers .",
    "a particle may wander in the trapping well for a while and then escape through the barrier .",
    "for such a history the lifetime would be a waiting time in the well plus a tunneling time .",

    "is gained through extrapolation of long time measurement to shorter times by assuming that a particle that has escaped through an energetically forbidden into a classical allowed region , follows classical dynamical laws . using these laws and scattering data the moment of escape from the tunneling region into the classical region",
    "is determined . a related experiment @xcite measures the perpendicular distribution of the nascent quantum mechanical momentum uncertainty of the initial state as it is revealed by tunneling .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the dynamics of the tunneling - induced decay of a localized state and to investigate to what extent we can extract information on the short time behavior from the long time dynamics .",
    "we introduce a simple quantum mechanical model , which simulates the experimental measurement of tunneling time and allows for opening and closing the barrier @xcite .",
    "we calculate the probability density and flux to study the short - term dynamics near the barrier and the long - term dynamics far away from it . for an opaque barrier we observe a relatively short transient time scale , where the tunneling is developed into a quasi - steady decay process .",
    "the details of the initial state have an important impact on the transients . at large distances ,",
    "the flux and the density start to grow at long times , reach a peak and then decrease by diffraction - in - time oscillations .",

    "to determine the effect of the time dependence of the barrier , we implemented escape time windows considerably shorter than the tunneling decay time @xmath66 .",
    "the increasing importance of faster components for shorter time windows leads to the extrapolated time estimated for the closing potentials smaller than that for the potentials permanently open .",

    "<S> motivated by recent time domain experiments on ultrafast atom ionization , we analyze the transients and timescales that characterize , besides the relatively long lifetime , the decay by tunneling of a localized state . while the tunneling starts immediately , some time is required for the outgoing flux to develop . </S>",
    "<S> this short - term behavior depends strongly on the initial state . for the initial state tightly localized so that the initial transients are dominated by over - the - barrier motion , the timescale for the flux propagation through the barrier is close to the bttiker - landauer traversal time . </S>",
    "<S> then a quasistationary , slowly decay process follows , which sets ideal conditions for observing diffraction in time at longer times and distances . to define operationally a tunnelling time at the barrier edge , </S>",
    "<S> we extrapolate backwards the propagation of the wave packet escaped from the potential . </S>",
    "<S> this extrapolated time is considerably longer than the timescale of the flux and density buildup at the barrier edge . </S>"
