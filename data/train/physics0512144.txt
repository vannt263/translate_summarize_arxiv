    "the emergence of class structure in society is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the biological and the social sciences @xcite .",
    "social hierarchies have been widely observed in animal populations including insects @xcite , mammals @xcite , and primates @xcite , as well as human communities @xcite .    the possibility of quantitative modeling of social phenomena using concepts and techniques borrowed from the physical sciences is rapidly gaining appreciation .",
    "examples of such modeling include the wealth distribution @xcite , opinion dynamics @xcite , and rumor propagation @xcite .",
    "such approaches typically draw analogies between individual agents in the social system and particles in a corresponding physical system and then identifying macroscopically observed phenomena with microscopic agent - agent interactions @xcite .    in this spirit , we seek to tie the emergence of social structures to specific interactions between agents within a general version of the recently - introduced advancement - decline process @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the social standing of each agent is characterized by a single number , its fitness .",
    "agents increase their fitness by interacting with other agents and also , their fitness may decline spontaneously .",
    "this simple model has only two parameters : the probability that the fitter agent advances in an interaction and the rate of decline .",
    "we find that a rich variety of familiar social structures emerges as a result of the competition between advancement and decline .",
    "when decline dominates , the society is static and the fitness distribution approaches a steady state .",
    "when the decline rate is comparable to the advancement rate , the society is dynamic and the characteristic fitness of the population increases linearly with time . in this case",
    ", there are several possibilities . when the less fit agent benefits from social interactions , an egalitarian society arises in which all agents advance at the same rate . consequently , inequalities among agents are small . on the other hand , when the fitter agent tends to benefit in competitions , agents advance at different rates and social inequalities increase with time .",
    "depending on the relative influence of advancement and decline , either the entire population or only a fraction of it may be upwardly mobile . in the latter case ,",
    "the society consists of a static lower class and an upwardly - mobile middle class .",
    "in section  [ adp ] , we introduce the general advancement - decline process and the governing master equations .",
    "the overall class structure and the statistics of the mobile middle class are obtained using scaling analysis in section  [ mobility ] .",
    "the basic features of the egalitarian society are investigated in section  [ equality ] , where the cumulative fitness distribution may be largely determined by linear traveling wave analysis . in section  [ poverty ] , the statistics of the lower class , where the fitness distribution is steady , are determined .",
    "we conclude in section  [ conc ] .",
    "we model a scenario in which the social status of an agent benefits from increased social interactions , while solitude or isolation have the opposite effect . indeed",
    ", highly connected individuals often have better access to information , resources , and power , that are often gained as a result of social interactions .",
    "thus , in our model there are two competing evolutionary processes that influence the fitness of agents : ( i ) advancement via social interactions , and ( ii ) decline due to the lack of interactions ( fig",
    ".  [ processes ] ) . for simplicity , social standing",
    "is represented by a single parameter , the integer - valued fitness @xmath3 .        0.3 in     _ ( i ) advancement .",
    "_ agents interact in pairs , and as a result of the interaction , only one advances .",
    "there are two possibilities : either the fitter agent advances or the less fit advances .",
    "we allow the fitter agent to advance with probability @xmath0 and the less fit agent to advance with probability @xmath1 .",
    "thus , when two agents with fitness @xmath4 and fitness @xmath5 interact ( with @xmath6 ) , the outcome is @xmath7 for @xmath8 the fitter agent always advances @xcite , while for @xmath9 the less fit agent always advances .",
    "the interaction rules are defined so that one randomly - chosen agent advances when two equally - fit agents interact . without loss of generality ,",
    "the interaction rate is set to @xmath10 .",
    "also , we consider the thermodynamic limit where the number of agents is infinite .    _",
    "( ii ) decline .",
    "_ in the decline step , the fitness of an individual decreases according to @xmath11 with rate @xmath2 .",
    "this process reflects a natural tendency for fitness to decrease in the absence of social activity .",
    "we impose the lower limit for fitness to be @xmath12 ; once an individual reaches zero fitness , there is no further decline .",
    "our goal is to understand how the fitness distribution of a population evolves as a function of the two model parameters , the advancement probability @xmath0 and the decline rate @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the fraction of agents with fitness @xmath4 at time @xmath14 . in the mean - field limit , where any pair of agents is equally likely to interact",
    ", the fitness distribution obeys the master equation @xmath15 here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the respective cumulative distributions of agents with fitness less than @xmath4 and fitness greater than @xmath4 .",
    "the boundary condition is @xmath18 .",
    "the first pair of terms accounts for decline , the second pair of terms describes interactions where the stronger agent advances , and the third pair of terms accounts for interactions where the weaker agent advances",
    ". the last pair of terms describes interactions between two equal agents and it reflects that when two such agents interact , only one of them advances .",
    "the prefactor @xmath10 arises because there are half as many ways to chose equal agents as there are for different agents .",
    "we consider the initial condition where all agents have the minimal fitness @xmath19 .",
    "it proves useful to rewrite the evolution equation in a closed form that involves only the cumulative distribution . summing the rate equations ( [ dis - eq ] ) and using the relations @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ", the cumulative distribution @xmath22 obeys @xmath23 the boundary conditions are @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and the initial condition is @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between the four terms in equations ( [ dis - eq ] ) and ( [ cum - eq1 ] ) .",
    "the master equation for the cumulative distribution can be simplified by consolidating the advancement terms @xmath28    the mean fitness @xmath29 evolves according to @xmath30 this result can be derived directly by summing the master equations ( [ dis - eq ] ) or even simpler , from the definition of the advancement - decline process .",
    "the first term accounts for advancement , where interactions occur with rate @xmath10 such that each interaction advances only one agent .",
    "the second term stems from decline and reflects the fact that all agents except for the least - fit ones decline with rate @xmath2 .",
    "we now discuss the basic social structures that emerge from the solution to the master equation .",
    "we determine the class structure of the population via a simple scaling analysis of the master equation .",
    "let us take the continuum limit of the master equation by replacing differences with derivatives , @xmath31 . to first order in this `` spatial '' derivative , we obtain the nonlinear partial differential equation @xmath32 \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial k}\\,.\\ ] ] when the spatial derivative and the temporal derivative balance , the typical fitness increases linearly with time , @xmath33 .",

    "middle - class society _ : we first examine the conditions for the linear scaling function ( [ scaling - sol - lin ] ) to apply .",
    "first , the cumulative scaling function ( [ scaling - form ] ) must be a monotonically increasing function .",
    "therefore , the linear solution ( [ scaling - sol - lin ] ) holds only when its slope is positive , that is , when .",
    "second , the scaling function is bounded , ; this condition implies the lower and upper bounds @xmath44 on the scaled fitness .",
    "the obvious constraints @xmath45 and @xmath46 lead to the conditions @xmath47 and @xmath48 . by imposing continuity , as well as the limiting behaviors @xmath49 and @xmath50 outside the linear region , the scaled cumulative distribution is the piecewise linear function ( fig .",
    "[ fig - phi - mc ] ) : @xmath51 this behavior describes a middle class society where _ all _ agents are upwardly mobile , as their fitness improves linearly with time . in this case",
    ", social inequalities also increase indefinitely with time : the agents at the bottom of the middle class have fitness @xmath52t$ ] and the richest agents have fitness @xmath53 .",
    "the middle - class society lies within the triangular region defined by the lines @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , shown in fig .",
    "[ classes ] .     versus @xmath57 at different times for @xmath58 and @xmath59.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "hierarchical society _ : along the line @xmath54 , the fitness of the poorest agents vanishes .",
    "moreover , the linear scaling solution ( [ scaling - sol - lin ] ) has a finite positive value at zero fitness for a range of parameter values @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "these two observations suggest the existence of another type of piecewise linear solution with @xmath60 .",
    "the bounds @xmath61 impose the conditions @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in this region , the scaling function has two distinct components ( fig .",
    "[ fig - phi - hs ] ) @xmath64 thus , we find a hierarchical society ( fig .",
    "[ classes ] ) that includes both an upwardly - mobile middle class and a static lower class .",
    "the lower class consists of a finite fraction @xmath65 of agents with zero fitness ( in scaled units ) . in section  [ poverty ] , we examine the lower class more closely and show that its fitness distribution is time - independent and extends only over a finite range .",
    "_ 3 . lower - class society _ : when the fraction @xmath66 of agents with zero fitness reaches 1 , the entire population is poor . for @xmath67 ,",
    "the condition @xmath68 occurs on the boundary @xmath69 . at this point",
    "the fitness distribution becomes a step function , @xmath70 with @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is a region of the phase diagram where the scaled fitness of the entire population is zero . for any initial state",
    ", the fitness distribution quickly approaches the step - function in a lower - class society .     versus @xmath57 at different times for @xmath75 and @xmath76.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "_ 4 . egalitarian society _ : there is another region of the phase diagram where the fitness distribution also becomes a step function . when @xmath56 and @xmath77 , then both @xmath78 and @xmath79 are equal to @xmath80 .",
    "therefore with @xmath81 . since the scaling function must change in a continuous fashion , we conclude that for @xmath82 , the scaling function is again a step function but with a jump at non - zero fitness .",
    "that is @xmath83 in this egalitarian society , all agents have the same scaled fitness @xmath84 or alternatively the fitness @xmath85 .",
    "the velocity @xmath86 follows easily from the average fitness ( [ kdot ] ) .",
    "since all agents advance at constant rate , then the term @xmath87 is negligible and therefore , the propagation velocity is @xmath88 in section [ equality ] , we show that in this society , the fitness differences between agents are small and do not grow with time .",
    "this is the sense in which the society is egalitarian .",
    "when @xmath82 , the weaker agent preferentially benefits in an interaction , so that the rich effectively supports the poor .",
    "we also note that the lower class and the egalitarian society share one common feature : they do not have a middle class .",
    "the boundary between these two phases , determined by the condition @xmath89 , is the line @xmath76 ( fig .",
    "[ classes ] ) .",
    "our numerical integration of the evolution equations confirms the overall picture of four different social structures ( fig .",
    "[ classes ] ) : a middle class society ( fig .",

    "the numerical data was obtained by integrating @xmath22 for @xmath90 using a fourth - order adams - bashforth method @xcite , with a specified accuracy of @xmath91 in the distribution @xmath22 .      our numerical results for the cumulative distribution @xmath22 , when plotted versus the scaling variable @xmath57 , smoothly approaches the appropriate expressions for the piecewise linear scaling function @xmath92 derived in the previous subsection ( figs .",
    "[ fig - phi - mc ] & [ fig - phi - hs ] ) . as time increases",
    ", the fitness distribution narrows .",
    "the simulations also show that the approach to the scaling solution is slowest in the vicinity of the extremes of the middle class @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( with @xmath95 for the hierarchical phase ) .",
    "the correction to scaling near these extrema can be determined by keeping derivatives up to second order in the continuum limit of the master equation .",

    "let us first consider the poorest agents , _",
    "i.e _ , the behavior close to @xmath93 . since the cumulative fitness distribution is small near this point , the nonlinear terms can be neglected and the governing equation ( [ cum - eq - second ] ) reduces to the standard convection - diffusion equation @xmath97 with propagation velocity @xmath98 and diffusion coefficient @xmath99 .",
    "indeed , since the fitness distribution is obtained from the cumulative distribution by differentiation , @xmath100 , the fitness distribution satisfies the same equation ( [ cum - eq - cont ] ) as the cumulative distribution .    for the middle - class society , we therefore conclude that the bottom of the middle class has a gaussian tail , with the center of the gaussian located at @xmath101 and with width @xmath102 .",
    "the same analysis can be carried out for the hierarchical society , where the quantity @xmath103 now satisfies the diffusion equation with zero velocity @xmath104 and diffusivity @xmath105 .",
    "conversely , the distribution for the top end of the middle class can be obtained by analyzing @xmath106 .",

    "( [ de ] ) with velocity @xmath107 and diffusivity @xmath108 .",
    "we conclude that the extremes of the middle class are characterized by gaussian tails whose extents grow diffusively with time . in terms of the scaling variable @xmath109 ,",
    "the deviation from the scaling function @xmath92 is appreciable only within a region of whose width is shrinking as @xmath110 .",
    "for the special case @xmath56 , the nonlinear terms vanish and the fitness distribution is described _ exactly _ by the linear convection - diffusion equation ( [ de ] ) with drift velocity @xmath81 and diffusion coefficient @xmath111 ( the nonlinear term is negligible ) . thus there is a drift toward smaller fitness for @xmath112 and the fitness distribution approaches a steady - state profile that decays exponentially with fitness . in the opposite case of @xmath113 ,",
    "the fitness distribution is simply a gaussian that drifts to larger fitness with velocity @xmath114 and whose width is proportional to @xmath115 . in the case of @xmath56 ,",
    "the relative position of an agent in the society is irrelevant and advancement reduces to a pure random walk @xcite .",

    "the fitness distribution has a very different character in each of the classes . in the lower class ,",
    "this fitness distribution approaches a steady state . in the middle class ,",
    "the distribution is self - similar in time and correspondingly the characteristic fitness increases linearly with time .",
    "although agents are upwardly mobile , the disparities between agents in the middle class also grows indefinitely . in the egalitarian class ,",
    "the fitness distribution follows a traveling wave , so that all agents constantly advance , but fitness differences between agents remains small .    much of the richness of the phenomenology is due to the fact that the mechanisms for advancement and decline are fundamentally different .",
    "one requires interaction between agents , while the other is a single - agent process .",
    "this dichotomy is reflected by the master equation where the decline terms are linear but the advancement terms are nonlinear . as a result , there is no detailed balance and the dynamics are non - equilibrium in character",
    ".    it should be interesting to use the advancement - decline model to analyze real - world data .",
    "one natural application is to wealth and income distributions of individuals , where both power - law and exponential behavior has been observed @xcite .",
