    "the agt correspondence @xcite implies a relation between the canonical partition function of a  and the grand canonical partition function of a generalized matrix model .",

    "this technique has recently been extended to a wide spectrum of coupled integrals models in @xcite .    in a suitable limit of the , agt - equivalent to the nekrasov - shatashvili ( ns ) limit of the @xmath1-background @xcite , loop equations are no longer algebraic but first order linear differential equations . in this context , the  is a natural quantization of the hermitian matrix model , to which it reduces at @xmath2 .",
    "the first element of this tower of differential equations has been mapped to the tq relation derived in @xcite that describes the dual susy gauge theory in the ns limit @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to ask about the existence of a structure similar to loop equations on the gauge side of the correspondence .",
    "but so far , the loop equation technique has not been applied to grand canonical matrix models .",
    "on the other hand , the cluster expansion of mayer and montroll @xcite has been successfully employed to derived an effective action relevant to the ns limit @xcite .",
    "can we relate this cluster expansion to the topological expansion of a generalized matrix model ?",
    "is there an equivalent of the loop equations technique on the grand canonical side ? and more generally , how do canonical and grand canonical coupled integrals relate to each other ?",
    "these are the issues we propose to address in these notes .    for this purpose , we consider the following grand canonical generalized matrix model , @xmath3 in analogy with the nekrasov partition function , integrals are understood as contour integrals over the real line .",

    "for instance , setting @xmath12 , one recovers the model proposed by j. hoppe in @xcite .",

    "instanton clustering _ in the context of susy gauge theories @xcite .",

    "such poles should be avoided by a deformation of the contour , picking up the corresponding residues . as a result ,",
    "terms of the @xmath11-expansions we are considering are reshuffled and the results presented here are no longer valid .",
    "these notes are organized as follows . in the second section",
    ", we compare the mayer cluster expansion of the grand canonical model with the collective field theory describing the large @xmath17 limit of the canonical model . taking the coupled limit @xmath16 and @xmath18 with",
    "@xmath19 fixed , we derive relations between the free energies at first orders .",
    "these relations are a consequence of the fact that the grand canonical partition function is the discrete laplace transform of the canonical one .",
    "we go on with the study of the canonical loop equations .",
    "we show that they relate to graphical identities between generating functions of rooted clusters .",
    "such generating functions show up in the mayer expansion and are identified with the multi - point densities . finally , we present a technique to derive directly the grand canonical loop equations .",
    "the main results are summarized in the concluding section .",
    "the cluster expansion was introduced by mayer and montroll as a way to compute the free energy knowing the form of the interaction between particles @xcite ( see also the book @xcite and the excellent review by andersen @xcite ) .",
    "it allows to derive the equation of state for various types of fluids . to do so",
    ", the kernel is expanded in @xmath11 , which corresponds to strength of molecular interactions in the case of non - ideal gases .",
    "the terms of the series consist of coupled integrals with the kernel @xmath8 instead of @xmath20 , and their expression is encoded into clusters . here , a cluster is a set of vertices connected by at most one link .",
    "the partition function is a sum over disconnected clusters , but after taking the logarithm the summation is restricted to connected ones .",
    "we denote by @xmath21 a generic connected cluster with @xmath22 vertices , @xmath23 the set of its links ( or edges ) and @xmath24 the set of vertices . to each vertex @xmath25 of a cluster",
    "is associated an integration over the particle of coordinate @xmath26 with measure @xmath27 .",
    "the edge @xmath28 between particles @xmath25 and @xmath29 represents the kernel @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the logarithm of the partition function writes @xmath31 where the symmetry factor @xmath32 is the cardinal of the group of automorphism for the cluster , i.e. the number of permutations of vertices that leave @xmath21 invariant .",
    "the first terms of the expansion and their symmetry coefficients are given in figure .",
    "the mayer expansion [ sum_clusters ] is an expansion at small ( bare ) fugacity @xmath33 .",
    "we would like to reformulate it as a @xmath33-exact expansion in the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "we will also renormalize the fugacity , keeping @xmath34 fixed . by analogy",
    ", @xmath33 would encode the gauge coupling constant of the nekrasov partition function , and the mayer cluster expansion is an expansion upon the number of instantons .",
    "more precisely , @xmath33 would correspond to @xmath35 and should be renormalized by a factor @xmath15 in the ns limit @xmath36 . in this context",
    ", the @xmath11-expansion we study corresponds to an expansion in the @xmath1-background parameter @xmath15 , or in the agt dual , to the semi - classical expansion of liouville correlators .    since each link brings a factor of @xmath11 , at first order only the clusters with a minimal number of links contribute .",
    "these clusters , denoted @xmath37 , have a tree structure , with @xmath38 links for @xmath22 vertices .",
    "thus , at first order in @xmath11 the free energy is given by the following sum over trees , @xmath39 where we used the shortcut notation @xmath40 .",
    "note that we have renormalized the free energy by a factor of @xmath11 , which is reminiscent of the volume of the @xmath1-background @xmath41 by which the prepotential should be multiplied in order to be finite in the @xmath42 limit @xmath43 .",
    "the first terms of this expansion are given in the figure .",
    "to evaluate @xmath44 , it is convenient to consider the generating function of rooted trees @xmath45 , defined as @xmath46 where with a slight abuse of notations we denoted the root and its coordinate by the same letter @xmath47 .",
    "the first order terms of this expansion are given in figure .",
    "this function is interpreted as a tree - level dressed vertex .",

    "it is useful to reformulate the previous expression [ basso ] of the free energy at first order as the value of an effective action @xmath56 $ ] at its extremum @xmath57 , @xmath58,\\quad \\text{such that}\\quad",

    "it is also worth noticing that when instanton clustering phenomenon is taken into account , one arrive at a similar expression , with logarithms replaced by dilogarithms in the second term .",
    "for instance , the effective action derived by nekrasov and shatashvili to describe @xmath0 sym reads @xmath60=\\hf\\int{\\rho(x)\\rho(y)g(x - y)}+\\int{\\left[\\text{li}_2(1-e^{-\\rho(x)})-\\rho(x)\\log(1-e^{-\\rho(x)})\\right]dx}+\\int{\\rho(x)\\log\\left(qq(x)\\right)dx},\\ ] ] where we used the notations of @xcite . expanding the middle term in @xmath61",

    "such clusters will be denoted @xmath66 .",
    "the relevant terms of the mayer expansion for the free energy are @xmath67 the @xmath64-expansion starts here at @xmath68 since at least three vertices are needed to form a cycle .",
    "as we go to higher orders in @xmath11 , more vertices will be needed to form the cycles , leading to a higher first order term in @xmath64 .",
    "thus , @xmath44 fully determines the @xmath64-expansion of the free energy up to order @xmath69 , and @xmath70 up to @xmath71 .",
    "to evaluate the summation over clusters @xmath66 , we first consider the clusters depicted on figure , and for which all vertices belong to the cycle .",
    "such clusters have a symmetry factor of @xmath72 due to the invariance under @xmath22 rotations , and a reflexion symmetry .",
    "their contribution writes @xmath73 where indices are taken modulo @xmath22 .",
    "all the clusters of type @xmath66 may be obtained by dressing the vertices of a pure cycle cluster by appropriate trees . summing over the dressing possibilities boils down to replace @xmath74 in the formula [ contrib_cycle ] by the tree - level dressed vertex @xmath75 .",

    "it is also the effective action of a collective field theory for a generalized matrix model at large @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we will show here that the corresponding matrix model is simply the canonical model @xmath79 defined in the introduction ( up to minor corrections ) .",
    "the fact that grand canonical and canonical models share the same effective action further leads to relate the rooted vertex generating function at tree level @xmath53 with the collective field at large @xmath17 .    at first order in @xmath11 ,",

    "the @xmath258-term have symmetry factor @xmath285 where @xmath286 is the symmetry factor of the composing trees , and we included the @xmath240 prefactor which is no longer canceled by the chirality .",
    "the two vertices related to this edge leads to the same rooted tree , which has the symmetry factor @xmath287 . taking the difference @xmath276",
    ", we get @xmath288 which is exactly the symmetry factor of the initial cluster @xmath37 , the factor of two taking into account the possibility of reflexion with respect to the final edge .",
    "in this appendix , we give a proof of the formulas [ qdq ] and [ qdq2 ] .",
    "first , examine the action of @xmath289 on the grand canonical free energy expressed as a sum over clusters as in [ sum_clusters ] , @xmath290 the only effect of this operation is to multiply the cluster integrals by the number of vertices @xmath22 .",
    "this expression should be compared to the cluster expansion of the integral of @xmath126 .",
    "the integral of rooted clusters reproduces the cluster contributions of the free energy expansion , and we should only be concerned about the symmetry factor . to a given cluster @xmath21 of the free energy expansion",

    "consider one vertex @xmath296 and the group of automorphism for the rooted cluster @xmath128 .",

    "those groups are subgroups of the group of permutations for the set vertices @xmath298 and can be decomposed into a product of transpositions .",
    "we also need a formal definition of @xmath292",

    "suppose we take an element @xmath299 , then this set is the orbit of @xmath300 under the group of automorphisms , @xmath301 note also that the groups of automorphisms for two vertices from @xmath292 are isomorphic , @xmath302 , although they have a different representation on the cluster @xmath21 .",

    "there is a unique @xmath267 such that @xmath304 . from the definition of @xmath292",
    ", @xmath305 also belongs to @xmath292 and we denote this element @xmath300 . by construction @xmath306 leaves the vertex @xmath47 invariant since @xmath307 is the transposition that exchanges @xmath47 and @xmath300 .",
    "therefore it is an element of @xmath297 that we denote @xmath308 , and we have @xmath309 .",
    "it means that given a vertex @xmath47 , any automorphism @xmath310 can be decomposed uniquely into its action on @xmath47 , given by @xmath307 and another automorphism that leaves @xmath47 invariant , namely @xmath308 . with @xmath311 and @xmath312 such that @xmath313 .",
