    "can statistical mechanics help to describe opinion dynamics ?",
    "the last few years have witnessed several attempts in this direction @xcite and monte carlo simulations have become an important part of sociophysics @xcite , enlarging the new field of interdisciplinary applications of statistical physics @xcite .",
    "the starting point is represented by a random distribution of opinions , which can be integer or real numbers , among a group of persons , or agents .",
    "next , some simple dynamical mechanism is introduced so that , due to interactions between the agents , the opinion of each agent changes over the time until , at some stage , a configuration is attained where the opinions are no longer modified by the dynamics and then remain the same .",
    "it is then interesting to study the possible stable opinion configurations at the end of the process to see , for instance , if it is possible that all agents stick to one and the same opinion ( `` consensus '' ) or whether a polarization around fewer dominant opinions takes place .",
    "the most studied consensus models are those of sznajd @xcite , galam @xcite , deffuant et al .",
    "@xcite and the one of krause and hegselmann ( kh ) @xcite .",
    "the crucial differences between the models are the dynamical mechanisms to update the opinions , but they differ as well in other important aspects . for instance , in the original versions of the models of deffuant and kh , the opinion variable is a real number between 0 and 1 , whereas in the models of sznajd and galam it is an integer ( this possibility was also studied for deffuant in @xcite ) . besides , there are as well differences in the way the topology of the society is conceived . in the sznajd model the agents sit on a lattice and can have opinion - affecting interactions only with their lattice neighbours ; in the models of deffuant and kh , instead , one assumes a society in which each agent has the same probability to interact with everybody , although recently scale free network topologies have also been considered for deffuant @xcite . among the above - mentioned consensus models , those of sznajd and deffuant are meanwhile quite well - known , as the convergence to the final configuration is relatively quick , which allows to simulate populations with millions of agents @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus instead on the kh model , which has not been investigated by many people so far . in its",
    "original version @xcite one introduces a real parameter @xmath5 , called confidence bound . at every monte carlo step , the randomly selected agent @xmath6 with opinion @xmath7 takes the average of the opinions of those agents @xmath8 such that @xmath9 .",
    "this averaging process makes the algorithm very time - consuming compared , for instance , to deffuant , and is essentially the reason why most people of the computational sociophysics community do not find it attractive .",
    "however , the real interest behind consensus models is whether they are able to describe real situations , and it is not said that the faster the algorithms the better they are ; the sznajd model could effectively simulate the distribution of votes among candidates in brazilian and indian elections @xcite .",
    "we study here a modified version of the kh algorithm , where opinions take integer values so that each individual has a finite number of possible choices .",
    "this is most often the case in real life ; thinking for instance about elections , the voters have a limited number of possible parties and/or candidates among which to choose .",
    "we have used several values for the number of opinions @xmath10 and checked how many different opinions survive in the final configuration .",
    "initially we have assumed a society in which every agent interacts with all the others .",
    "this is however quite an unrealistic situation ; therefore we have as well checked what happens if the personal relationships within the society form a scale free network , with few people having lots of friends and many having just a few . to build the network we adopted the popular `` rich get richer '' strategy proposed by barabsi and albert @xcite .",
    "our opinions can take the values @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , ... @xmath10 . as far as the confidence bound @xmath5 is concerned , we will assume in this paper that the agents are influenced only by the individuals whose opinions differ by at most one unit from theirs .",
    "this corresponds to the case @xmath14 in the original kh model .",
    "actually , in order to go smoothly to the continuous limit one should introduce another parameter @xmath15 , which is the discrete confidence bound , i.e. the maximal distance between compatible opinions ( for us @xmath16 ) , and take the limit @xmath17 by keeping @xmath18 fixed .",
    "the algorithm starts by randomly distributing the opinions among the agents .",
    "the use of integer - valued opinions spoils the original kh concept of `` average of compatible opinions '' , because such average in most cases would not be an integer .",
    "a possible way out is to re - interpret the spirit of the original kh model in a probabilistic fashion .",
    "suppose we want to update the status of agent @xmath6 , which has opinion @xmath19 .",
    "the number of agents with compatible opinions are @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( respectively for opinions @xmath23 , @xmath19 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "if the total number of compatible individuals is @xmath25 , we say that agent @xmath6 takes opinion @xmath23 , @xmath19 or @xmath24 with _ probability _",
    "@xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "this is to our mind a natural extension of the kh model to discrete opinions , and is the version we have used here .",
    "the status of the agents is updated sequentially , in an ordered sweep over the whole population ; the program stops if no agent changed opinion during an iteration .",
    "the fact that the opinions are discretized allowed us to speed up the algorithm compared to the continuous case . in the latter the time to complete an iteration goes as @xmath29 ( @xmath3 is the size of the population ) , because for each agent to update one needs to make a sweep over the whole population to look for compatible individuals and calculate the average of their opinions . here",
    "only the probabilities @xmath30 matter , so we keep an array where the opinion histogram @xmath21 is stored ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "when we update the agent @xmath6 with opinion @xmath19 , from the histogram we derive directly the probabilities for the agent to take its next opinion .",
    "suppose that agent @xmath6 takes opinion @xmath8 , what we need to do is to increase @xmath32 and to decrease @xmath21 by one unit , to get the new opinion distribution , after that we can proceed to update a new agent .",
    "in this way we avoid to count each time the number of compatible individuals , which is very time consuming , and the time needed to complete the iteration goes as @xmath33 ( for each agent one needs to make a sweep over the @xmath34 compatible opinion channels to get the probabilities , in our case @xmath35 ) . with our algorithm systems with millions of agents ,",
    "unreachable by standard kh , can be simulated ( it took us less than six hours to simulate one million agents on a pc ) .",
    "we found that the convergence to a stable configuration is much slower than in the original kh model . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the average number of sweeps necessary for convergence in the two cases , as a function of @xmath10 ( we use the relation @xmath14 to make a correspondence between the two models ) .",
    "we see that , except for very high values of @xmath10 , the number of evolution steps for our algorithm is an order of magnitude higher than for the continuous model .",
    "this is most likely due to the stochastic character of our procedure ; the opinion distributions vary more slowly if we allow jumps from one opinion channel to the neighbouring ones with some probability instead of sistematically shifting every agent to the average channel .",
    "moreover , the standard deviation of the average evolution time is much larger in the discrete than in the continuous model , which hints to the presence of wild fluctuations .",
    "the main result of our simulations is the existence of a threshold @xmath36 , such that , for @xmath37 , consensus is always reached .",
    "this is true for both social topologies we have considered . for a society where each agent has relationships with all others , we find that @xmath38 as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . here",
    "we plot the probability of having polarization as a function of the number @xmath3 of agents , for @xmath39 . by polarization",
    "we mean that more than just a single opinion survive in the final configuration .",
    "the probability is given by the fraction of configurations with polarization .",
    "for @xmath40 this probability decreases strongly with @xmath3 and for @xmath41 all samples presented a single final opinion . for @xmath42 , instead , the probability for polarization is basically one for @xmath41 .",
    "we remark that our threshold is higher than in the sznajd model , where @xmath36 lies between @xmath13 and @xmath43 @xcite , and in the discretized version of deffuant for deffuant and @xmath44 ( our estimate ) for kh . ] , where @xmath45 .",
    "this shows that the dynamics of the kh model is the most suitable to explain how competing factions can find an agreement and to justify the stability of political coalitions with several parties like in italy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show how the number of surviving opinions @xmath2 varies with @xmath10 , for several @xmath3 s .",
    "we see that , as long as @xmath46 , so that no finite size effects take over , @xmath2 is approximately the same independently of the number of agents ; the result holds for the deffuant model as well @xcite .",
    "let us now check what happens if we put the agents on a scale free network a la barabsi - albert . to build the network we must specify the outdegree @xmath47 of the nodes , i.e. the number of edges which originate from a node .",
    "the procedure is dynamic ; one starts from @xmath47 nodes which are all connected to each other and adds further @xmath48 nodes one at a time .",
    "when a new node is added , it selects @xmath47 of the preexisting nodes as neighbours , so that the probability to get linked to a node is proportional to the number of its neighbours . in all networks created in this way the number of agents with _ degree _",
    "@xmath19 , i.e. having @xmath19 neighbours , is proportional to @xmath49 for @xmath19 large , independently of @xmath47 .    in our simulations we took the network as undirected , so that communication between two neighbouring agents can take place in both directions .",
    "we find again that there is a threshold @xmath36 for the system to evolve to complete consensus .",
    "interestingly , @xmath36 depends on the outdegree @xmath47 , as shown in fig .",
    "in fact , the final stable configurations are those in which each agent is surrounded only by agents which share its opinion or are uncompatible , a solution of a special graph colouring problem ; only in this case each agent will maintain its opinion in the future with probability one . if @xmath47 is small the average degree is small and it is easier to reach such configurations even when just a few opinions are available . looking at fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we see that @xmath50 for @xmath51 , respectively we find that consensus is not complete for @xmath52 , but is reached in about @xmath53 of the cases . ] .",
    "no polarization is possible for @xmath54 because , the network being connected , there would be at least two clusters sharing a border . as each agent has at least @xmath47 neighbours by construction , for large @xmath47 we expected to reach the threshold @xmath38 that we have found in the case in which everybody is connected to everybody ; this is indeed true for @xmath47 larger than about 40 .",
    "the analysis of the number of surviving opinions @xmath2 is instead relatively independent of the outdegree @xmath47 .",
    "we chose @xmath55 , in order to make comparisons with corresponding results for the discretized deffuant model @xcite .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows @xmath2 as a function of @xmath10 for different population sizes .",
    "the pattern looks very similar to the one observed in @xcite for deffuant : for @xmath10 not too small , @xmath2 equals @xmath10 and only when @xmath10 gets close to @xmath3 , finite size effects take over and @xmath2 converges towards @xmath3 . in the latter case ,",
    "the simulation stops very early because most agents have different opinions and therefore the chance for an agent to change its mind is small . in @xcite",
    "a simple scaling behaviour of @xmath2 with @xmath10 and @xmath3 was observed .",
    "the ansatz was    @xmath56    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we rescaled the data of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] according to the ansatz of eq .",
    "the `` teeth '' below the horizontal line refer to small values of @xmath10 , and we know that here @xmath2 equals one or is close to one , independently of @xmath3 ; otherwise the scaling is good .",
    "we have studied an extension of the krause - hegselmann consensus model to integer - valued opinions , both when all agents talk to each other and when they sit on the nodes of an undirected barabsi - albert network .",
    "we assumed that only agents with opinions differing by at most one unit can influence each other .",
    "a non - trivial implementation is necessarily probabilistic and many more iterations are required for convergence compared to the standard model . on the other hand , our algorithm is much faster than the continuous version and therefore larger population sizes can be explored . in a society where each agent can interact with all others , when no more than seven different opinions / positions are possible , the system always evolves towards consensus if the size @xmath3 of the population is large enough ( of the order of @xmath57 agents or more ) .",
    "on the other hand , on a network - structured society , the threshold @xmath36 depends on the minimal number of friends an agent can have ; if this minimum is less than @xmath58 , consensus is more difficult and @xmath36 can lower up to @xmath13 .",
    "this versatility of the model makes it more suitable than others in order to explain how consensus can be reached in a variety of situations . in italy , for instance , the @xmath59 s were the years of the so - called `` pentapartito '' , a government s coalition of five parties .",
    "the stability of this coalition could be justified neither by the sznajd model nor by deffuant , but it is natural in our model ( although the concept of political stability in a country where fifty - seven governments alternated in fifty - eight years is questionable ! ) .      on",
    "a network @xmath2 grows with @xmath3 if @xmath10 and @xmath3 increase so that the ratio @xmath60 is constant , but is intensive if @xmath10 is kept fixed when @xmath61 .",
    "when @xmath10 is not too small @xmath2 is well described by the same simple scaling function that reproduces the data for the discretized deffuant model @xcite .",
    "moreover , we find that @xmath62 for @xmath10 of the order of ten or larger , so in a realistic society with more than ten different opinions / positions , the dynamics of the kh model is unable to suppress any of them .",
