    "high - contrast imaging searches for low - mass companions to nearby and/or young stars have increased dramatically in number since the initial discovery of a brown dwarf companion to a main sequence star ( gl  229 ) through direct imaging @xcite .",
    "one particularly powerful technique is adaptive optics ( ao ) , which provides the high angular resolution ( @xmath2 ) achievable at the diffraction limit of large ground - based telescopes .",
    "the widening niche of high - contrast imaging opened by recent developments in ao technology implies that not only brown dwarfs but exo - solar planets may be within the realm of direct imaging . nowadays",
    "nearly every ground - based telescope equipped with an ao system hosts an imaging companion - search project .",
    "the sudden explosion in interest in this topic has been fueled by the success of the radial velocity ( r.v . )",

    "while the sensitivity of direct imaging to `` planetary - mass '' ( 113 jupiter masses ( @xmath4 ) ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) objects at such separations from sun - like stars is still extremely limited due to contrast requirements , several higher - mass brown dwarf companions have been discovered at wider separations ( see compilation in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some at projected distances as small as 1419  au @xcite .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopic monitoring and direct imaging are thus complementary in searching for sub - stellar companions to stars .",
    "future development of both methods promises to narrow , and eventually close the sensitivity gap between them .",
    "young stars are the most suitable targets for direct imaging of sub - stellar companions . at ages of 10100 million years ( myr )",
    "the expected brightness ratio in the near ir between a 10  @xmath5 object and a solar - type star is @xmath6@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "modern ao systems can routinely achieve comparable dynamic range at 1@xmath0 separations from bright stars .",
    "hence , for young stars within 40  pc of the sun we can probe for massive planets at separations comparable to the giant planet region in our own solar system .",
    "however , few young stars are known at such small heliocentric distances .",
    "these are constrained to several tens of members of young moving groups : tw  hya @xcite , tucana / horologium @xcite , and @xmath8  pic @xcite , and have already been targeted with sensitive space - based and ground - based ao surveys , which have uncovered 34 brown dwarf companions @xcite , but no planetary - mass ones .    because contrast and projected separation are the limiting factors in detectability of sub - stellar companions , brown dwarfs , being more luminous than planets , are detectable at greater heliocentric distances and at smaller angular separations from their host stars . at the same physical separation from the primary ( e.g. , 50100  au ) ,",
    "brown dwarf companions should be detectable around older ( several gigayears [ gyr ] ) and/or more distant ( @xmath9200  pc ) stars compared to planets , allowing a larger sample of targets .",

    "although faint primary stars , such as m dwarfs or white dwarfs , offer more favorable contrast for imaging sub - stellar companions , we have chosen to limit our sample to solar analogs because of interest in determining the multiplicity statistics of sub - stellar objects around other suns .",
    "furthermore , several recent large surveys have already explored the multiplicity of nearby ( @xmath950  pc ) cool stars @xcite , or white dwarfs @xcite , while a large sample of f ",

    "the obtained value of 39.82@xmath200.25  mas / pix is consistent with the pre - ship measurement of 39.7@xmath200.5  max / pix . because only one binary was used for calibrating nirc2 , a 0.63% error term corresponding to the uncertainty in the semi - major axis of the binary has been added in quadrature to the uncertainty of our measurement .",
    "spectroscopy of faint targets in the halos of bright objects is more challenging than spectroscopy of isolated targets .",
    "care needs to be taken to achieve optimum suppression of the scattered light of the bright stars either by using a coronagraph ( in a manner similar to coronagraphic imaging ) , or by aligning the slit so as to minimize light admitted from the halo .",

    "spectra of brighter companions , for which the signal from the halo is negligible compared to that from the target , are obtained by aligning the binary along the slit .",
    "given that we often use the f5k5  iv  v primaries in our sample as telluric standards , such alignment improves our observing efficiency .",

    "for the observations of hd  129333 with pharo , and of rx  j0329.1 + 0118 with nirc2 , the binary was aligned along the slit , whereas spectra of the other two binaries ( with fainter companions ) were obtained by placing each component in the slit individually .",
    "a 0.26@xmath0 ( 6.5  pix ) slit was used in pharo , and a 0.08@xmath0 ( 2  pix ) slit was used in nirc2 , resulting in spectral resolutions of 1200 at @xmath19 and 1000 at @xmath37 with pharo , and 2400 at fifth - order @xmath19 ( 1.221.35@xmath12 ) , 2900 at sixth - order @xmath19 ( 1.151.28@xmath12 ) , and 2700 at @xmath37 with nirc2 .    flat fields with the dispersive grisms in place were not obtained for any of our spectroscopic observations . instead , the raw spectra were divided by an imaging flat field , constructed in the same manner as for the imaging observations .",

    "strong positive deviations due to cosmic ray hits were then eliminated using the l.a .",

    "fringing was at a noticeable level ( @xmath3815% ) only in spectra obtained with pharo ( of hd  129333 ) , and was reduced to below 5% by dividing the target spectrum by that of the telluric standard , taken at a nearby position on the detector .",
    "extraction of the spectra is performed using iraf / apextract tasks .",
    "to reduce contamination from the halo of the primary in the companion spectra , the local background ( arising mostly from the halo ) is fit by a first - order polynomial along the direction perpendicular to the dispersion axis and subtracted during extraction .",
    "in addition , the aperture width for the companion spectrum is conservatively set to the full width at half maximum of the profile so as to include only pixels with maximum signal - to - noise .",
    "pixels within the aperture are summed along detector columns ( which are nearly perpendicular to the dispersion axis ) , and the resulting `` compressed '' spectrum is traced along the dispersion axis by fitting a high order ( 8 to 15 ) legendre polynomial .",
    "the tracing step is approximately equal to the slit width , where at each step the data point is obtained as the sum of 310 adjacent pixels ( 1.53 slit widths ; the spectra of fainter objects being more heavily averaged ) in the compressed spectrum .",
    "this procedure is found to produce consistent results for extractions of multiple dithered spectra of the same companion , indicating that scattered light contamination from the primary has been reduced to a small level .",
    "nevertheless , in some cases of very faint close - in companions , the continuum shape is still found to vary noticeably among the individual extractions .",
    "we therefore avoid classifying the spectra of the companions based on their continuum shapes , but rely on the relative strengths of narrow absorption features ( discernible given our resolution ) instead ( section  [ sec_spectroscopy ] ) .",
    "a dispersion solution for each spectrum is obtained from night sky lines in non - sky - subtracted images , using the task identify and oh emission - line lists available in iraf . for the spectra of primaries observed separately ( e.g. , hd  49197 and v522  per ) , whose shallower ( 10120  sec ) exposures do not contain telluric emission lines at a high enough @xmath28 to allow the fitting of a dispersion solution , such is derived after registration with deeper ( 1015  min long ) companion spectra taken immediately after those of the primaries . the tasks fxcor and specshift",
    "are used to cross - correlate and align the individual wavelength - calibrated spectra for a given object .",
    "the individual primary and companion spectra are then median - combined using scombine .    since the primaries ( when earlier than k0 ) double as telluric standards , their spectra are first corrected for photospheric absorption from atomic hydrogen ( h  p@xmath8 at 1.282@xmath12 and h  br@xmath22 at 2.166@xmath12 ) by hand - interpolating over the absorption with the task splot .",
    "weaker absorption features due to , , , , and , although present in the spectra of our telluric standards , are left uncorrected because of blending ( at our resolution ) with various oh absorption lines in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "after thus correcting the telluric spectra , the spectra of the companions are divided by those of the telluric standards .",
    "finally , the spectra of the companions are multiplied by black bodies with temperatures corresponding to the spectral types of the telluric standards ( based on effective temperature vs.  spectral type data from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and boxcar - smoothed by the width of the slit .",
