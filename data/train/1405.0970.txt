    "nonlinear sigma model is a @xmath2-component scalar field theory where the field defines a mapping from space - time to a target manifold .",
    "a mapping here means a function from space - time to the target space @xcite .    by a nonlinear sigma model , we mean a field theory with the following properties @xcite :    * the fields , @xmath3 , of the model are subjected to nonlinear constraints for all points @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is source ( base ) manifold , i.e. the spatial submanifold of the ( 2 + 1 ) or ( 3 + 1)-dimensional space - time manifold . * the constraints and the lagrangian density are invariant under the action of a global ( space independent ) symmetry group , @xmath6 , on @xmath3 .",
    "the lagrangian density of a free ( without potential ) nonlinear sigma model on a minkowski background space - time is defined as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is field metric , @xmath9 is the minkowski metric tensor , @xmath10 is a scaling constant with dimensions of ( length / energy)@xmath11 and here @xmath12 is field .",
    "the nonlinearity is manifest in the field metric , @xmath13 .",
    "a special case of the nonlinear sigma model occurs when the target manifold is the unit sphere @xmath14 in @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 . in case of @xmath17",
    "then @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is kronecker delta . the lagrangian density ( [ 1 ] )",

    "simple representation of @xmath12 ( in case of time - dependent ) is @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are scalar functions on the background space - time , with minkowski coordinates @xmath24 .",

    "the simplest example of nonlinear sigma models is the @xmath29 nonlinear sigma model which consist of @xmath30-real scalar fields , @xmath31 , having the lagrangian density @xcite @xmath32 where the scalar fields , @xmath33 , satisfy the constraint @xmath34 the lagrangian density ( [ 7 ] ) is obviously invariant under the global ( space independent ) orthogonal transformations @xmath29 , i.e. the group of @xmath30-dimensional rotations @xcite @xmath35    one of the most interesting examples of @xmath29 nonlinear sigma models due to its topological properties , is the @xmath36 nonlinear sigma models in 1 + 1 dimensions , with the lagrangian density @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 , due to @xmath39 , with the constraint @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "two solutions to these equations ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) , are    * a monopole solution , which has @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the spherical radius . * a vortex solution , which is found by imposing the `` hedgehog '' ansatz @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath2 is a positive integer , and @xmath46 is a constant phase factor .    a vortex is a stable time - independent solution to a set of classical field equations that has finite energy in two spatial dimensions ; it is a two dimensional soliton . in three spatial dimensions ,",
    "a vortex becomes a string , a classical solution with finite energy per unit length @xcite .",
    "solutions of finite energy , satisfying the appropriate boundary conditions , are candidate soliton solutions @xcite .",
    "recall that there is in fact a family of vortex solutions @xmath47 or @xmath48 for each value of @xmath49 where @xmath49 is positive constant , there is a different vortex solution .",
    "but , the mass per unit length @xmath50 does not depend on @xmath49 .",
    "( we use the same notation for energy per unit length and mass per unit length , due to equivalence of energy - mass as @xmath51 . here , we take @xmath52 ) .",
    "this means that the vortex solutions are what is called neutrally stable to changes in scale . as @xmath49 change",
    ", the scale of the vortex changes , but the mass per unit length , @xmath53 , does not .",
    "note that because of eq.([15 ] ) , there is a preferred winding number , when @xmath2 is a small as possible : @xmath54 .",
    "it means that for the vortex solution , the topological charge is just the winding number , @xmath2 .",
    "it can be shown that the topological charge is conserved , no matter what solution @xmath12 we have .",
    "so , topological charge is a constant , no matter what nonlinear sigma model we use .",
    "so long as @xmath55    let us find @xmath22 by solving the two equations of motion ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath22 satisfies the equation @xmath56 and that the solution satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath57 and @xmath58 is @xmath59 this is the vortex solution .",

    "but , that the energy per unit length of the vortex solutions @xmath64 is finite , and does not depend on the value of @xmath49 .",
    "this last fact means that the vortex solutions in the nonlinear sigma models have no preferred scale .",
    "a small value of @xmath49 corresponds to a more extended vortex solution , and a larger value of @xmath49 corresponds to a more compact vortex solution , as we can see by plotting @xmath22 ( or @xmath65 ) for different values of @xmath49 and a fixed value of @xmath2 ( say , @xmath54 ) .",
    "but , the value of the energy per unit length , @xmath53 , is the same for all these solutions , and so there is no natural size for the vortex solutions .",
    "it is for this reason that a skyrme term is added to the lagrangian density @xcite .",
    "we need to add skyrme term to the lagrangian to stabilize the vortex ( which is neutrally stable to cylindrically symmetric perturbations ) .",
    "original sigma model lagrangian ( in unit sphere ) is @xmath66 adding a skyrme term to eq.([26 ] ) , then eq.([26 ] ) becomes @xmath67 eq.([27 ] ) can be written in other expression by substituting ( [ 16 ] ) into ( [ 27 ] ) .",

    "so , it is energetically favourable for the vortex to evolve , so that @xmath73 increases .",
    "then , @xmath79 and as @xmath77 for fixed @xmath80 , @xmath81 and the field evaporates to infinity . to fix this problem",
    ", we add a potential term , @xmath82 , to lagrangian density @xmath69 .",
    "so , we have @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a direction of @xmath85 at @xmath86 ( where , @xmath87 ) .",
    "this @xmath88 model is like baby skyrmion model @xcite p.207 , eq.(2.2 ) .",
    "the kinetic term along with the skyrme term are not sufficient to stabilize a baby skyrmion , contrary to the usual skyrme model .",
    "the kinetic term in @xmath89 dimensions enjoys ( suffers from ) conformal invariance and the baby skyrmion can always reduce its energy by inflating ( infinitely ) .",
    "hence , one adds the mass term which limits the size of the baby skyrmion .",
    "the usual skyrme term of course prohibits the collapse of the soliton @xcite .",
    "back to skyrme model ( [ 28 ] ) and refer to eq.([16 ] ) . instead of choosing @xmath90",
    "we choose @xmath91 where @xmath0 is twist term .",
