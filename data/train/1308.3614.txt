    "correlation functions describing the coherence properties of interacting or noninteracting quantum particles received considerable attention @xcite .",
    "these functions are used almost in all branches of modern physics .",
    "typically , standard sources of incoherent light generate photons possessing a second - order correlation function @xmath0 @xcite . very recently",
    ", it was shown that photons emitted by a single two - level system ultra - strong - coupled with a thermal optical cavity show photon correlation functions @xmath1 or even smaller than unity exhibiting quantum light features , i.e. sub - poissonian photon statistics @xcite .",
    "the effect occurs when the atom - cavity coupling rate becomes comparable to the cavity resonance frequency .",
    "for such an interaction regime , the counter - rotating terms in the interaction hamiltonian should be taken into account",
    ". therefore , various novel schemes generating highly correlated light are still important .",
    "particularly , larger photon correlations are useful for a number of practical applications in many - body phenomena with strongly interacting photons @xcite as well as in photonic quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "an ensemble of @xmath2 collectively interacting few - level atoms via an incoherent electromagnetic field reservoir generates light with @xmath3 or even higher in the steady - state .",
    "however , the photon intensity is rather weak @xcite . applying external coherent light sources",
    ", one can generate intenser photon fluxes proportional to @xmath2 or @xmath4 with , however , lower second - order photon correlations in the steady - state , i.e. @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , higher - order photon correlations @xcite can be generated in a somehow more complicated setup involving nonlinear crystal superlattices @xcite .",
    "finally , correlated photon emission can be achieved from multiatom entangled rydberg states , for instance @xcite .",
    "thus , it becomes intriguing to find alternative ways to generate both an intense steady - state photon flux with enhanced photon - photon correlations .    here , we demonstrate a scheme capable to generate a moderately intense and highly correlated photon flux .",
    "in particular , the obtained second- and third - order photon correlation functions in the steady - state are several times larger than corresponding ones but for a thermal light source .",
    "the scheme is based on pumping a two - level emitter embedded in a leaking optical microcavity . at moderately strong pumping ,",
    "i.e. the respective rabi frequency is larger than the spontaneous and cavity decay rates , respectively , the spontaneous scattered photons into free electromagnetic field modes show the well - known mollow spectrum @xcite modified by the cavity field @xcite .",
    "now , if the laser - atom - cavity system is in resonance with the central - band of the mollow spectrum then the side - bands will contribute to the atom - microcavity quantum dynamics only via the non - secular terms .",
    "under certain conditions , these terms are responsible for enhancing the microcavity mean - photon number as well as the second- and third - order photon correlations in the steady - state .",
    "furthermore , a moderate incoherent pumping of the resonator mode does not modify the photon statistics considerably .",
    "notice the existence of an experiment measuring two- and three - photon correlations in a strongly driven atom - cavity - system for different parameters of interest @xcite .",
    "this makes our results experimentally attractive .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the analytical approach and the system of interest , while in section iii , we obtain the corresponding equations of motion and describe the obtained results .",
    "the summary is given in section iv .",
    "the hamiltonian describing a two - level real ( or artificial ) atomic system possessing the frequency @xmath6 and interacting with a coherent source of frequency @xmath7 , and embedded in a microcavity of frequency @xmath8 , in a frame rotating at @xmath7 , is : @xmath9 where we have assumed that @xmath10 . in the hamiltonian ( [ hm ] )",
    "the first term describes the cavity free energy with @xmath11 , while the second one characterizes the interaction of the two - level emitter with the microcavity mode via the coupling @xmath12 .",
    "the third term considers the qubit s interaction with the laser field with @xmath13 being the corresponding rabi frequency .",

    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are the excited and ground state of the qubit , respectively , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the creation and the annihilation operator of the electromagnetic field ( emf ) in the resonator , and satisfy the standard bosonic commutation relations , i.e. , @xmath22=1 $ ] , and @xmath23=[a^{\\dagger},a^{\\dagger}]=0 $ ] .",
    "we are interested in the laser dominated regime where @xmath24 ( here , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the spontaneous and cavity decay rates , respectively ) and shall describe our system using the dressed - states formalism @xcite : @xmath27 . applying this transformation in eq .",
    "( [ hm ] ) with @xmath28 , one arrive then at the following dressed - state hamiltonian in a frame rotating at the rabi frequency @xmath13 : @xmath29 here , @xmath30 while the new quasispin operators , i.e. @xmath31 , @xmath32^{+}$ ] and @xmath33 are operating in the dressed - state picture .",

    "one can observe that the hamiltonian ( [ hi ] ) can be separated into a time - independent part and a time - dependent one containing fast oscillating terms .",
    "therefore , the time - dependent part , @xmath36 , can be regarded as a perturbation to the time - independent part when @xmath37 .",
    "one can apply then the transformation : @xmath38 @xcite to arrive at the final time - independent hamiltonian characterizing the coherent evolution of the laser - atom - cavity system : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "this is achieved via pumping of the microcavity mode with a broadband laser field with its spectral width larger than the resonator decay rate @xmath26 , respectively .",

    ", we shall describe the microcavity photon statistics via the second- and third - order photon correlation functions .",
    "the equations of motion for the variables of interest can be easily obtained from the master equation ( [ me ] ) .",
    "for instance , the steady - state value of the mean - photon number , i.e. @xmath51 , can be extracted from the following system of linear steady - state equations : @xmath52 in the system of equations ( [ s1 ] ) , and throughout the paper , we used the fact that the dressed - state inversion is zero in the steady - state , i.e. @xmath53 , as well as the trivial condition @xmath54 which is the case for a single - atom system . by completing the system of equations",

    "represents the steady - state mean - photon number in the microcavity mode , namely : @xmath56 one can observe here , that the mean - photon number in the steady - state is enhanced due to both the incoherent pumping and the nonlinear contribution proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure  ( [ fig1 ] ) , where we plotted the microcavity mean - photon number , @xmath58 , as a function of different relevant parameters . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the photon number in the steady - state goes to @xmath50 as the bad - cavity limit is achieved .",
    "further , we focus on the degree of second- and third - order coherences of microcavity photons defined , respectively , as @xcite : @xmath60 the unnormalized k - order correlation function @xmath61 describes the probability of a k - photon detection , simultaneously . to obtain the steady - state expressions for correlation functions given in eq .",
    "( [ crr ] ) , the system of equations ( [ s1 ] ) have to be completed with additional equations obtained with the help of eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) .",
    "in particular , the unnormalized steady - state second - order photon correlation function can be obtained from the following system of equations ( and the corresponding @xmath55 expressions ) : @xmath62 the equation of motions required to obtain the third - order correlation function are given in the appendix b.    taking into account the systems of equations ( [ s1 ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) , one can obtain the steady - state expression for the second - order coherence function , that is : @xmath63 where    @xmath64    while the missing parameters are given in eqs .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) , in the appendix a. here , again , one can observe that the nonlinear term @xmath42 modifies the second - order photon correlation .",
    "in particular , when @xmath65 one obtains : @xmath66 while for @xmath67 one has @xmath0 , that is , we recover the incoherent - source result for a second - order correlation function . for smaller values of @xmath68 and @xmath69",
    ", the second - order coherence function tends to a constant value : @xmath70 while for @xmath65 and @xmath71 we have : @xmath72 these behaviors are shown in fig .",

    "( [ fig3 ] ) , we depict the difference @xmath74 as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "for very small values of @xmath68 , a moderate incoherent pumping almost does not affect the photon coherences , while when the ratio @xmath68 increases the photon statistics modifies accordingly ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] and eqs .",

    "in summary , we have investigated the correlations functions of microcavity photons generated due to coherent interaction of a two - level qubit with an external laser field as well as a microcavity mode and in the presence of both the spontaneous emission and cavity damping , respectively .",
    "in addition , the cavity mode is pumped incoherently . in the intense - field limit , i.e. the involved rabi frequency is larger than the spontaneous and cavity decay rates , respectively , we found enhanced second- and third - order photon correlations .",
