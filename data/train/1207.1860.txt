    "it is important to note that massey s proof  @xcite does not require @xmath0 and @xmath2 to be statistically independent .    now , suppose @xmath0 and @xmath2 are indeed independent ( which is common in practice ) .",
    "our first main result , theorem  [ th : boundonxr ] improves  , showing that for any source distribution @xmath9 , @xmath12 as a consequence , we prove that for any cipher achieving perfect secrecy , the logarithm of the message sample size can not be larger than the entropy of the secret key , @xmath13 comparing with the first inequality in  , we see that   is valid even if the source distribution @xmath9 is fixed and known .",
    "this paper is based on the model in fig .",

    "previously in the literature , the amount of key required in a cipher system has been measured by the entropy of the common secret key .",
    "we will argue in this paper that @xmath16 is only valid for measuring the _ initial key requirement _ , by which we mean the amount of secret randomness that must be shared between the sender and the legitimate receiver , prior to transmission of the ciphertext .",

    "this new measure offers more insights , and in the second part of this paper , we will design efficient cipher system that can be used multiple times , where @xmath17 is one of the system parameters to be optimised .    besides expected key consumption , we also want to minimize the _ number of channel uses _ required to transmit the ciphertext @xmath1 from the source to the legitimate receiver .",

    "although @xmath58 satisfies shannon s fundamental bound  , theorem  [ th : boundonxr ] , in particular  , shows this choice of key @xmath2 is insufficient to achieve error free perfect secrecy .",

    "for example , we can accumulate @xmath63 symbols from the source @xmath64 and treat these @xmath63 symbols together as one super - symbol @xmath0 .",
    "it is reasonable to consider finite @xmath63 because practical systems have only finite resources to store the super - symbol .",
    "unless the source has some special structure , the distribution of @xmath0 can not be uniform for any @xmath63 if the @xmath65 are not uniform .",
    "for example , if the source is stationary and memoryless , accumulating symbols will only make @xmath25 and @xmath16 grow with @xmath66 .",
    "one may argue that the coding rate of @xmath25 could be reduced because the sender and receiver share the same side information @xmath2 and @xmath67 is possible .",
    "in other words , a compressor may be appended to the encoder in fig .  [",
    "fig : encdec ] in order to reduce the size of the ciphertext .",
    "this configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hxgivenr ] .",
    "however , we can not simply apply the results from source coding with side information here , because the ciphertext still needs to satisfy the security constraint . if the new output @xmath68 satisfies the perfect secrecy and zero - error constraints , @xmath69 , then @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ fig : hxgivenr ] is simply another eps system , governed by theorem  [ th : boundonxr ] .     compressing the output of an eps cipher . ]    to complete this section , we show that the lower bounds   and   are simultaneously achievable using a one - time pad  @xcite .",

    "this immediately suggests that the one - time pad leaves no room for improvement .",
    "however , this conclusion in fact stems from a folk theorem that the `` required size of the secret key '' is measured by the key entropy .",
    "the hidden assumption behind this folklore is that the _ cipher system is used only once_. in typical practice , a cipher system will be used repeatedly for the transmission of multiple messages .    consider the following scenario .",
    "suppose an initial secret key @xmath2 is delivered to the sender and the receiver prior to commencement of message transmission .",
    "now , suppose the sender uses this key to encrypt a message @xmath0 , which is then delivered to the receiver over the public channel . clearly , some portion of the secret randomness @xmath2 has now been used .",
    "the central question is as follows : can the sender and receiver continue to securely communicate without first receiving a new key ? for example , if @xmath0 is a single bit and @xmath2 is a 100-bit random key , it is indeed likely that another message can be securely transmitted .",
    "the natural questions are : what is the maximum size of the second message ?",
    "alternatively , how much of the key @xmath2 was consumed in the first round of transmission ?",
    "below , we will show that when an error free perfect secrecy system is used multiple times , the key consumption should not be measured by @xmath16 but by @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , with respect to our definitions , we will exhibit systems with key consumption that can be made arbitrarily close to @xmath39 .",

    "a new random bit is secretly transmitted from the sender to the receiver when @xmath90 .",
    "after the system is used once , the expected key consumption is therefore given by @xmath93 which happens to also equal @xmath94 .",
    "it turns out that this is not mere coincidence .",

    "the case when only @xmath6 or @xmath8 is finite can be similarly proved .",
    "this paper studied perfect secrecy systems with zero decoding error at the receiver , with the additional assumption that the message @xmath0 and the secret key @xmath2 are independent , @xmath434 . under this setup",
    ", we found a new bound @xmath51 on the key requirement , improving on shannon s fundamental bound @xmath435 for perfect secrecy .    to transmit the ciphertext @xmath1 , the lower bound on the minimum number of channel uses has been shown to be @xmath436 .",
    "if the source distribution is defined on a countably infinite support or a support with unbounded size , no security system can simultaneously achieve perfect secrecy and zero decoding error .",
    "we also defined and justified three new concepts : _ residual secret randomness _ , _ expected key consumption _ , and _ excess key consumption_. we have demonstrated the feasibility of extracting residual secret randomness in multi - round secure communications which use a sequence of error free perfect secrecy systems . we quantified the residual secret randomness as @xmath437 .",
    "we further distinguished between the size @xmath16 of the secret key required prior to the commencement of transmission , and the expected key consumption @xmath26 in a multi - round setting .",
    "in contrast to @xmath438 , we showed that @xmath26 is lower bounded by @xmath39 , giving a more precise understanding about the role of source entropy in error free perfect secrecy systems .",
    "the excess key consumption is quantified as @xmath101 , and is equal to @xmath430 if and only if the minimal expected key consumption is achieved .",
    "one of the main objectives of this paper was to reveal the fundamental tradeoff between expected key consumption and the number of channel uses .",
    "for the regime where the minimal @xmath26 is assumed , @xmath25 and @xmath16 are inevitably larger and corresponding lower bounds for @xmath25 and @xmath16 have been obtained .",
    "if the source distribution @xmath9 has irrational numbers , the additional requirements on the alphabet sizes of @xmath1 and @xmath2 to achieve minimal @xmath26 have been shown .",
    "we have proposed a new code , the _ partition code _ , which generalizes the one - time pad , and can achieve minimal @xmath26 when all the probability masses in @xmath9 are rational . in some cases , the partition code can simultaneously attain the minimal @xmath25 and @xmath16 in this regime .    at the other extreme , the regime where the minimal number of channel uses is assumed , the one - time pad has been shown to be optimal . for the intermediate regime , we have formulated an optimization problem for the fundamental tradeoff between @xmath26 and @xmath25 .",
    "we also demonstrated that compression before encryption can not minimize either @xmath16 , @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "this paper has highlighted a few open problems .",
    "first , the complete characterization of the tradeoff between @xmath26 and @xmath25 remains open .",
    "second , the partition code is only one class of codes designed to minimize expected key consumption .",
    "codes achieving other points on the tradeoff curve are yet to be discovered .",
    "in particular , a code achieving minimal @xmath25 and @xmath16 in the regime of minimal expected key consumption is important for the design of efficient and secure systems ."
