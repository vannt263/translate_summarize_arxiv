    "existence of periodic orbits for orientation preserving annulus homeomorphisms has been extensively studied .",
    "one of the motivations is a celebrated theorem of dynamical systems , the so - called `` last geometric theorem of poincar '' .",
    "roughly this result says that an area - preserving homeomorphism of the closed annulus which rotates one boundary component clockwise and the other counterclockwise possesses at least two fixed points .",
    "this result was conjectured and proved in special cases by poincar @xcite , and was finally proved by birkhoff @xcite .",
    "this problem has been considered by many authors and was actually the trigger for a great deal of research ( see the paper @xcite for a historical review on the subject ) . since franks paper @xcite , where he generalized and proved the statement for homeomorphisms of the open annulus , interest on the problem of existence of periodic orbits for non compact surface homeomorphisms arose ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , in @xcite the problem of existence and growth rate of periodic orbits for degree two surface endomorphism was considered . in this paper , they deal with a particular case of problem 3 posed in @xcite : let @xmath8 be the @xmath9-sphere , and @xmath10 a continuous map of degree @xmath9 ; is the growth rate inequality @xmath11true ?",
    "the answer is no , as the map @xmath12 has only the poles as periodic points .",
    "however , in @xcite it is shown that the growth inequality holds in a particular case : if @xmath0 is @xmath13 and preserves the latitude foliation , then for each @xmath14 , @xmath15 has at least @xmath16 fixed points .    in this paper , we study the existence of periodic orbits for covering maps of the open annulus @xmath17 of degree @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "note that the growth inequality holds trivially for the closed annulus @xmath18 as each connected component of the boundary of the annulus must be invariant by @xmath0 or @xmath19 , and we are assuming @xmath3 . on the other hand , the covering map @xmath12 provides a periodic point free example in the open annulus @xmath20 .",
    "our result relates both to the theory of annulus homeomorphisms , and to the work in @xcite .",
    "let us introduce some preliminary definitions .",
    "if @xmath17 is a continuous function , then the homomorphism @xmath21 induced by @xmath0 on the first homology group @xmath22 , is @xmath23 , for some integer @xmath2 .",
    "this number @xmath2 is called the degree of @xmath0 .",
    "we say that an open subset @xmath24 is _ essential _ , if @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the induced map in homology by the inclusion @xmath27 .",
    "we say that a subset @xmath28 is _ essential _ if any neighbourhood of @xmath29 in @xmath4 is essential .",
    "we say that a subset is _ inessential _ if it is not essential , or equivalently , if it is contained in a disk of @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath30 is a periodic point for @xmath0 , its _ period _ is the number @xmath31 .",
    "we write @xmath32 for the set of periodic points of period @xmath14 of a given map @xmath0 , and @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34 be the compactification of the annulus @xmath4 with two points so that it is homeomorphic to the two - sphere .",
    "each connected component of @xmath35 is called an _ end _ of @xmath4 . note that if @xmath0 is a proper mapping , then @xmath0 extends continuously to @xmath34 , and either fixes both ends or interchanges them .",
    "we need one last definition : what it means for @xmath0 to be complete ; we postpone this until section [ niel ] because the definition involves some nielsen theory .",
    "we recall that @xmath36 are _ nielsen equivalent _ if there exist an arc @xmath37 joining @xmath30 and @xmath38 such that @xmath37 is homotopic to @xmath39 with fixed endpoints .",
    "if @xmath0 is complete then for each @xmath14 , @xmath40 has exactly @xmath41 nielsen classes of fixed points , ( see lemma [ crcomp ] in section 3 ) .",
    "we prove the following :    [ per ] let @xmath42 be a covering map of degree @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "suppose there exists an essential continuum @xmath43 such that @xmath44 .",
    "then @xmath0 is complete .",
    "as explained above , the growth rate inequality holds for annulus maps under the standing hypothesis .",
    "note that this result is strictly a consequence of degree ; an irrational rotation in the open annulus has no periodic points , and has every essential circle as a compact invariant subset .",
    "results in the same line of work have been obtained by boronski in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the periodic points given by theorem [ per ] do not necesarilly belong to @xmath5 ( see section [ ex ] , example [ e1 ] ) .",
    "the problem of whether or not the fixed points of a given map with a compact invariant set @xmath5 belong to @xmath5 is known in the literature as cartwright - littlewood theory . in a seminal paper ,",
    "m. cartwright and j. littlewood @xcite proved that if @xmath5 is a nonseparating continuum of the plane , invariant under an orientation preserving homeomorphism @xmath45 , then @xmath45 has a fixed point _ in @xmath5_. existence of a fixed point under such hypothesis",
    "was already known on account of brouwer s plane translation theorem ( @xcite ) , the novelty being that the fixed point must belong to the set @xmath5 .",
    "an easy proof or cartwright - littlewood s theorem can be found in the extraordinary single - page paper of m.brown @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "h. bell proved cartwright - littlewood s theorem for orientation reversing plane homeomorphisms , and his results were later generalized by k. kuperberg in @xcite for arbitrary plane continua ( not necesarilly nonseparating ) . in [ e1 ] , section [ ex ] , we construct a degree two covering map @xmath0 of the annulus with a totally invariant essential continuum @xmath5 ( @xmath46 ) , such that @xmath47 .",

    "if @xmath56 , we write @xmath57 for the point @xmath58 .",
