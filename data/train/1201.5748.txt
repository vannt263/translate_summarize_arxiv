    "two - band models of superconductivity have been developed more than fifty years starting from the papers @xcite-@xcite . for the present",
    "the number of discovered multi - gap superconducting materials is quite large , including cuprates , @xmath0 and iron - arsenic compounds . in this field",
    "various theoretical schemes have been elaborated , see @xcite-@xcite and references therein .",
    "in particular , the derivation of high - quality superconducting regions from oxygen ordering , observed recently in la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 @xcite , supports the multi - band theoretical scenario of superconductivity in cuprates .    in a two - gap superconductor with interband pair - transfer interaction one has to deal with coupled band condensates .",
    "in this situation the quantities , related initially to the superconducting states of independent bands , acquire mixed character and they describe the collective features of the whole two - component condensate .",
    "an example of such quantities in a superconducting system with interband coupling are the coherence lengths which can not be attributed to different bands involved @xcite , see also @xcite-@xcite . in the present contribution",
    "we examine in details the properties of coherence length scales in a two - band superconductor .",
    "we start with the following hamiltonian in the terms of @xmath3-operators for a two - band superconductor with intraband couplings and interband pair - transfer interaction :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 in eqs . ( [ eq1])-([eq4 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath8 is the band index , @xmath9 is the spin index , @xmath10 is the chemical potential , @xmath11 is the periodic potential of a crystal , and @xmath12 are the electron - electron interaction constants .",
    "we suppose that @xmath13 , i.e. the autonomous superconducting phase transition takes place in the both bands if interband interaction is absent . however , if interband interaction is turned on , the superconducting states of the bands are not independent anymore .",
    "the following derivation of the ginzburg - landau equations exploits the scheme from @xcite , generalized for two - band situation .",
    "first , one introduces the effective one - electron hamiltonian in the self - consistent field approximation , @xmath14 in what follows we simplify the calculations supposing if @xmath15 should be considered as a special problem . ] @xmath16 in this case the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq5 ] ) can be diagonalized by means of the bogoliubov - valatin transformation ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the operators of creation and destruction of elementary excitations ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the wave vector . as a result @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the ground state energy and",

    "[ f1 ] , the maximum of @xmath92 near @xmath93 reflects the `` memory '' about the lower autonomous phase transition which takes place if interband interaction is absent .",
    "the increase of @xmath90 suppresses this maximum and finally @xmath92 decreases monotonically as temperature @xmath91 decreases , cf",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] . at the same time",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath94 becomes weaker as one can observe from figs .",
    "[ f1]-[f3 ] . the further increase of interband coupling does not introduce any qualitative changes into the temperature behaviour of coherence lengths .",
    "the length scales found are related to the critical and non - critical fluctuations which appear as linear combinations of the fluctuations of band superconductivity order parameters , see also @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one can find by using the expansion in powers of @xmath95 that the following expressions approximate the temperature dependence of the critical coherence length near the phase transition point : @xmath96 where @xmath97 the coefficient @xmath98 coincides with the length found in @xcite as a single coherence length in the rigorously limited ginzburg - landau scheme in a two - band superconductor .",
    "the gradient expansion and its cut - off in the ginzburg - landau equations ( [ eq21 ] ) is justified if @xmath99 i.e. the length scales @xmath100 are large enough compared to the microscopic lengths @xmath101 .",
    "it is relatively easy to satisfy the inequality ( [ eq33 ] ) for @xmath92 .",
    "however , the situation is different in the case the non - critical coherence length @xmath102 . in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] the comparison of the dependencies of @xmath103 and @xmath104 on interband interaction constant is demonstrated ( we have chosen @xmath105 , i.e. @xmath106 ) .",
    "it is seen that in the region of weak interband coupling the condition ( [ eq33 ] ) can be satisfied for @xmath94 . at",
    "that the smaller the difference between the temperatures of autonomous phase transitions @xmath107 and @xmath108 in the absence of interband interaction , the higher and sharper in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] the maximum of @xmath103 _ vs _ @xmath109 is . for larger @xmath90 the condition",
    "( [ eq33 ] ) for @xmath94 becomes violated .",
    "consequently , in this region of parameters the higher terms in the gradient expansion should be taken into account for the treatment of the non - critical length scale of coherency .",
    "recently the systematic extension of the ginzburg - landau scheme has been suggested in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "to conclude , we determined two coherence lengths in a two - gap superconductor with intra- and interband couplings .",
    "these length scales are not related to the concrete bands involved in the formation of the superconducting ordering in a system with interband pair transfer interaction .",
    "one of these lengths as a function of temperature deverges near the phase transition point , the other one is non - critical .",
    "the non - monotonic temperature dependence of coherence lengths appears in the superconducting phase if the interband coupling is sufficiently weak .",
    "we suggest that the appearance of the non - critical coherence length is a substantial feature of two - gap superconductivity .",
