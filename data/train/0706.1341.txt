    "the @xmath0 plays a vital role in the spectroscopy of light @xmath19 mesons .",
    "the role of experiment is to identify the resonances required by data and determine their parameters : mass , width and branching ratios .",
    "many schemes exist for grouping the observed states into nonets .",
    "the @xmath20 glueball is predicted at @xmath21 mev @xcite , but with a sizable error from uncertainty in how to normalise the mass scale .",
    "the glueball would make an additional su(3 ) singlet state , mixing with neighbouring nonet states .",
    "it is therefore necessary to scrutinise the evidence for each state .",
    "klempt @xcite and klempt and zaitsev @xcite question whether there is an identifiable @xmath20 glueball and hence argue against the existence of @xmath0 .",
    "ochs has argued against it at conferences for two reasons .",
    "he suggests that it can be confused with a broad ` background ' which might obscure the analysis of the 1000 - 1500 mev mass range @xcite ; secondly he argues that it has not been identified definitively in cern - munich data @xcite .",
    "the weakness of these arguments is that no attempt has been made to refit the data where @xmath0 has been identified .",
    "the main objective of the present work is to do just that .",
    "the earliest evidence for the @xmath0 came from experiments on @xmath22 at the argonne and brookhaven laboratories in the late 1970 s .",
    "a peak was observed in the s - wave at 1300 mev in three sets of data : cohen et al .",
    "@xcite , pawlicki et al .",
    "@xcite and etkin et al @xcite . in those days",
    "it was called the @xmath23 .",
    "further evidence appeared in the years 1992 - 6 from several experiments in quick succession .",
    "amsler et al . reported a peak in the @xmath24 s - wave at @xmath25 mev in crystal barrel data on @xmath26 annihilation at rest into @xmath27 @xcite ( as well as a further peak at 1560 mev , later identified as @xmath13 ) .",
    "gaspero reported a @xmath20 state in @xmath1 at @xmath28 mev in @xmath29 bubble chamber data at rest in the reaction @xmath30 @xcite ; the obelix collaboration quickly confirmed this observation in @xmath31 @xcite , quoting a mass of @xmath32 mev .",
    "crystal barrel reported a similar @xmath20 state in @xmath1 at @xmath33 mev in @xmath26 annihilation at rest to @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the earliest fits in which @xmath0 and @xmath13 appeared together were made using early low statistics crystal barrel data on @xmath3 at rest @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "publications using the full statistics data ( used here ) appeared in 1995 @xcite and 1996 @xcite .",
    "the latter work involved a simultaneous fit @xcite to cern - munich data on @xmath35 @xcite and data on @xmath22 .",
    "the observation of nearby @xmath0 and @xmath13 states , both dominantly non - strange , excited interest in the @xmath20 glueball .",
    "further extensive studies of @xmath0 and @xmath13 by crystal barrel , obelix and omega collaborations may be traced via the particle data tables @xcite .",
    "the present work fits simultaneously the 5 most definitive sets of data available to me .",
    "the first two are crystal barrel data on @xmath3 at rest in liquid hydrogen @xcite and gaseous hydrogen .",
    "these two sets of data allow a clean separation of annihilation from @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath26 states : p - state annihilation is @xmath36 in liquid and @xmath37 in gas .",
    "the combined fit also includes two sets of data for @xmath38 in liquid and gas .",
    "there are visible @xmath0 and @xmath13 peaks in both of these sets of data .",
    "the fifth definitive set of data comes from bes ii for @xmath39 .",
    "there is a visible @xmath11 peak at 1350 mev , attributed to interference between @xmath0 , @xmath13 and @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "those data are refitted with and without inclusion of @xmath0 .    finally , an earlier analysis fitted data on @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite ; this analysis also fitted kloe data on @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath22 data suggest the presence of @xmath0 but can not be considered definitive compared with the other sets of data .",
    "this analysis remains consistent with parameters of @xmath0 found here .",
    "the particle data group quotes very large errors for mass and width of @xmath0 : @xmath45 mev . from the present analysis ,",
    "the error on the mass is very small : @xmath46 mev from systematics .",
    "the resonance will still be referred to as @xmath0 , despite the fact that its peak position in the @xmath11 channel comes out nearly 100 mev lower .",
    "the particle data group appears to be influenced by large variations in masses and widths fitted to @xmath1 data .",
    "these variations are due to the fact that there has been no serious attempt to include @xmath2 in these analyses .",
    "a major objective here is to treat fully the dispersive effects due to the opening of the @xmath1 threshold , to which @xmath12 , @xmath0 and @xmath13 all couple strongly .",
    "the full form of the breit - wigner resonance formula , @xmath47\\ ] ] contains a real dispersive term @xmath48 @xcite , which for the @xmath1 channel reads @xmath49 we shall find that @xmath48 is large , indeed larger than @xmath50 in the breit - wigner denominator .",
    "it turns out that this places severe limitations on the ratio @xmath51 which can be fitted to data .",
    "this point was not appreciated in earlier work .",
    "nevertheless , a good solution emerges naturally .",
    "here there is an interesting conclusion .",
    "the fit includes explicitly the @xmath52-dependence of the @xmath1 channel , as far as present data allow .",
    "however , the amplitude still produces an argand diagram very close to a circle and hence similar to a simple pole .",
    "this justifies to some degree the common usage of a simple breit - wigner formula in fitting data .",
    "a third point concerns the coupling to @xmath1 by the broad component in the @xmath11 s - wave related to the @xmath12 pole ; this component will be called @xmath12 as a short - hand .",
    "it plays an essential role in fitting all data where a @xmath11 pair is produced .",
    "let us review the situation briefly .",
    "the @xmath11 s - wave phase shift reaches @xmath53 at @xmath54 mev .",
    "there is an adler zero in the elastic amplitude at @xmath55 , just below the @xmath11 threshold .",
    "the resulting amplitude rises approximately linearly with @xmath52 . in production data from e791 @xcite and bes ii @xcite ,",
    "a strong peak is observed at @xmath56 mev .",
    "both these production data and elastic scattering may be fitted with the same breit - wigner denominator , but with an @xmath52-dependent width and with different numerators for production and elastic cases ; for elastic scattering , the numerator contains the adler zero , whereas for the bes ii production data fitted here it is consistent with a constant .",
    "the same variation of the phase shift with @xmath52 is observed in elastic scattering and production data from 450 to 950 mev within errors of @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the large displacement of the pole from 900 mev arises from the @xmath52-dependence of the width ; the cauchy - riemann relations control the @xmath52-dependence of the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude as one extrapolates from the physical @xmath52-axis .",
    "the fit of ref .",
    "@xcite to @xmath22 and @xmath58 data and the kloe branching ratio for @xmath59 determines ratios of coupling constants for the @xmath12 coupling to @xmath60 and @xmath42 : @xmath61 and @xmath62 . the remaining unknown is the coupling of @xmath12 to @xmath1 .",
    "this will play an essential role in the work reported here .",
    "a vital question is whether this coupling to @xmath1 eliminates the requirement for the @xmath0 .",
    "tornqvist has suggested @xcite @xcite that a second pole could appear in the @xmath12 amplitude due to the opening of the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "could this explain @xmath0 as a non-@xmath63 state ?",
    "a related point is that maiani et al . have suggested that @xmath0 may be a molecular state @xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 discusses the formalism and gives equations .",
    "amplitudes are expressed in terms of @xmath64-matrices for reasons discussed there .",
    "this raises some issues concerning how to fit elastic scattering .",
    "readers interested only in results may skip this section , but the issues going into the formulae are outlined in words for the general reader .",
    "it is important to add that extensive fits to crystal barrel and other data have been made by anisovich and sarantsev , using k - matrix techniques @xcite .",
    "these analyses produce results closely similar to the present work , and there is no conflict between the two analyses : they should be regarded as complementary views .",
    "the k - matrix analyses use several sets of data not available to me , for example crystal barrel data on @xmath65 .",
    "their conclusion is that @xmath0 is needed , with mass and width in close agreement to what is found here .",
    "however , they do not address the question of how much the fit changes if @xmath0 is omitted .",
    "section 3 is the heart of the paper , concerning fits to data with and without @xmath0 .",
    "a suggestion made by ochs is that the amplitude for the @xmath11 s - wave should be fitted freely in magnitude and phase in bins of @xmath11 mass , without assuming a breit - wigner form . over the limited mass range 1100 - 1460 mev ,",
    "this is done and confirms the assumption of a resonance form for the amplitude .",
    "section 4 describes the simultaneous fit made to cern - munich data on @xmath66 elastic scattering .",
    "they can be fitted slightly better with @xmath0 than without , but can not be considered definitive on this question .",
    "section 5 describes the fit to @xmath27 data ; there is a visible peak in these data , sufficient alone to justify the existence of @xmath0 .",
    "section 6 describes the fit to bes data on @xmath67 .",
    "an important detail is that these data , together with data on @xmath68 @xcite and @xmath69 @xcite require the existence of an @xmath70 distinct from @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath72 data contain a clear @xmath11 peak at 1790 mev .",
    "data on @xmath72 and @xmath73 final states require a ratio @xmath74/br[f_0(1790 ) \\to kk ] > 3 $ ] @xcite .",
    "data on @xmath75 contain a strong @xmath60 peak due to @xmath71 ; this peak is completely absent from @xmath76 data which require @xmath77/br[f_0(1710 ) \\to kk ] < 0.11 $ ] with 95% confidence .",
    "a single resonance must have the same branching ratios in all sets of data , whereas these data differ in branching ratio by at least a factor 22 .",
    "so two separate resonances are required .",
    "unfortunately , the pdg ignores these decisive results and continues to lump @xmath70 with @xmath71 . in",
    "the present fits to @xmath3 data , @xmath70 is included together with @xmath0 and @xmath13 , though its eventual contribution to the data is small .    section 7 makes brief remarks on data for @xmath22 , and section 8 remarks on the need for further analyses where the opening of thresholds leads to large dispersive effects .",
    "section 9 makes concluding remarks .",
    "there are two obvious ways of expressing amplitudes , using @xmath78-matrices or @xmath64-matrices .",
    "each has some advantages , but also limitations .",
    "it seems likely that neither is perfect , so approximations are needed in either case .",
    "resonances appear directly as poles of the @xmath64-matrix .",
    "the @xmath11 s - wave is of primary concern . for this amplitude ,",
    "@xmath78-matrix poles are displaced strongly from @xmath64-matrix poles . for elastic scattering ,",
    "@xmath79 ( where @xmath80 is the phase shift ) , and @xmath78-matrix poles are at @xmath81 and 1200 mev , whereas the @xmath82 pole is at @xmath83 mev .    in fitting production data , e.g. @xmath3 , it is obviously advantageous to use @xmath64-matrices , because resonances are @xmath64-matrix poles .",
    "the primary objective of the present work is to test whether the @xmath0 is needed or not .",
    "it is necessary to move its mass , width and couplings to all decay channels in steps , so as to examine the effect on @xmath84 .",
    "this can not be done readily using @xmath78-matrices , since the @xmath0 is built out of a combination of @xmath78-matrix poles .",
    "it is also necessary to remove @xmath0 from the fit and again test @xmath84 .",
    "this can not be done in a controlled way using @xmath78-matrix poles : if one @xmath78-matrix pole is removed , all resonances are affected .",
    "for this reason , amplitudes will be written directly in terms of @xmath64-matrices .",
    "there is a second related point .",
    "it is well known that minimisation routines converge best when expressed in terms of eigenvectors , i.e. @xmath64-matrix poles . weak or questionable resonances appear as weak eigenvectors and can be recognised immediately from the error matrix of the fit .",
    "yet another consideration is that earlier work fitting the @xmath12 pole and cern - munich data was done using @xmath64-matrices @xcite .",
    "the formulae used there are readily expanded to incorporate the @xmath1 channel .",
    "@xcite fitted data on @xmath22 and @xmath42 and also kloe data with @xmath64-matrices ; it is valuable to maintain consistency with that analysis , for comparison of results .",
    "there are however questions about how to deal with elastic scattering . below the @xmath60 threshold ,",
    "the amplitude is confined to the unitary circle .",
    "both @xmath82 and @xmath12 contribute , as do the low mass tails of further resonances .",
    "experiment shows directly how to treat the overlap of these resonances . in cern - munich data ,",
    "the @xmath11 phase shift rises dramatically near 1 gev from @xmath85 to @xmath86 due to the narrow @xmath82 .",
    "the appropriate treatment below the @xmath60 threshold is to add phases , hence multiply @xmath87-matrices : @xmath88 .    above the inelastic threshold ,",
    "multiplying @xmath87-matrices gives a fit of rather indifferent quality .",
    "it is clear that other factors must be relevant . if one solves a relativistic schr \" odinger equation using a trial potential which reproduces @xmath12 , @xmath82 and @xmath0 , the solution is automatically unitary and analytic .",
    "one finds that amplitudes differ from both ( i ) the product of individual @xmath64-matrices for each resonance , ( ii ) the sum of @xmath78-matrices .",
    "neither gives an accurate parametrisation .",
    "the main problem appears to be that resonances mix via processes of the form @xmath89 or other intermediate channels @xmath60 , @xmath42 , etc .",
    "mixing is strong for elastic scattering , since the amplitudes are at the unitary limit when one takes account of all channels .",
    "the mixing gives rise to well known level - repulsion .",
    "this repulsion is still highly significant one full - width away from the resonance mass .",
    "formulae for mixing have been given by anisovich , anisovich and sarantsev @xcite and will be reproduced here in a slightly modified notation . for the 2-resonance case",
    ", the denominator @xmath90 of one resonance may be written @xmath91 mixing arises via @xmath92 which in general is complex and may be @xmath52-dependent .",
    "the propagator matrix describing two resonances is then @xmath93    because @xmath12 overlaps strongly with @xmath82 , @xmath0 and @xmath13 , this mixing has been included explicitly in fitting elastic data .",
    "it turns out that inclusion of mixing between these pairs of states leads to an excellent fit using constant values of @xmath92 .",
    "it is also instructive to expand the denominator of the last term of eqn .",
    "( 3 ) off resonance using the binomial theorem .",
    "the result is @xmath94    - \\frac { b_{12}b_{21}}{m_2 ^ 2 - s }      \\left ( 1 + \\frac { m_2(s)+im_2\\gamma_2^{tot}}{m_2 ^ 2   - s } \\right).\\ ] ] from the last term , one gets contributions of the same sign to @xmath95 and @xmath96 , while from the first term @xmath97 $ ] contributions have opposite signs .",
    "the result is to rotate the phase of the amplitude , which derives purely from @xmath90 .",
    "this rotation is large when resonances overlap strongly .",
    "unless the mixing is included explicitly , one must expect that the resonance denominator may need to be multiplied by a phase factor @xmath98 .",
    "this was indeed observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was sufficient to take @xmath99 as constant .",
    "this point will be relevant in fitting @xmath100 and @xmath101 states to elastic data .",
    "consider as an example @xmath22 .",
    "it is necessary to continue this amplitude below threshold ; in @xmath64-matrix language this is the analytic continuation of the @xmath102 component . as a result , there are contributions to @xmath11 elastic scattering from sub - threshold @xmath103",
    ". however , caution is needed in making this continuation .",
    "the @xmath22 amplitude is proportional to phase space @xmath104 for the @xmath60 channel .",
    "below threshold , this continues analytically as @xmath105 .",
    "the analytically continued amplitude rises rather strongly below threshold .",
    "if one is not careful , this continued amplitude can make dominant contributions to elastic scattering below the inelastic threshold .",
    "this is counter - intuitive .",
    "a particular case arises for @xmath15 , which couples strongly to @xmath106 .",
    "if one does nothing about the large sub - threshold @xmath106 contribution , it produces big interferences wth the nearby @xmath40 and can distort rather severely the mass and width fitted to @xmath40 .",
    "the answer to this point is straightforward .",
    "amplitudes above threshold contain form factors due to the finite radius of interaction forming the resonance . in ref .",
    "@xcite , data on @xmath22 were fitted empirically to an exponential form factor @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is momentum in the @xmath60 rest frame in gev / c ; a study of @xmath15 in @xmath109 at rest in crystal barrel data also requires a form factor above the @xmath106 threshold of similar strength @xcite .",
    "the analytic continuation can be evaluated below threshold using a dispersion integral .",
    "this is not an accurate procedure because of uncertainties in the @xmath22 amplitude above the available mass range .",
    "however , the qualitative feature emerges that a rapidly falling form factor is required below threshold as well as above . in ref .",
    "@xcite this sub - threshold form factor was fitted to kloe data with the result @xmath110 .",
    "this empirical cut - off will be adopted here for sub - threshold coupling to @xmath60 , @xmath42 and @xmath106 .",

    "is chosen in present work with @xmath52 in gev@xmath122 .",
    "if one were fitting data on @xmath123 , this form factor would be rather important .",
    "however , for the present study of @xmath0 and @xmath124 it has only rather small effects within errors .",
    "this is because the @xmath125 term in the breit - wigner denominator cuts off the @xmath11 channel strongly at high mass ; the @xmath126 amplitude is already quite small at 1.45 gev , where the form factor begins .",

    "the suggestion made here is that confinement involves a hybridisation due to overlapping of nearby resonant states .",
    "one linear combination of states with favourable @xmath273 configuration moves down and other combinations are pushed up in energy , in a way analogous to formation of the covalent chemical bond .",
    "a similar variational principle is involved in the formation of a superconductor .",
    "the relevance of such an idea to the confinement process itself is a matter of conjecture without calculations to support it .",
    "the idea is that there is feedback between the formation of resonances and a dynamic confinement , i.e. condensation .",
    "such a mechanism would explain naturally why most of the huge number of possible molecular states are not observed : most of them are driven upwards and become a continuum .",
