    "a fundamental problem of condensed matter physics was ( and still remains ) the study of conductivity of electrons in solids . since in an infinite perfect crystal",
    ", electrons can propagate ballistically , a natural question is raised : what happens in a more realistic situation when there is disorder in the crystal due to impurities or defects ?",
    "will the increase of the degree of disorder lead to a decrease of conductivity , or not ?",
    "these questions were first answered in a seminal paper by p.w .",
    "anderson  @xcite , where it was shown that for large enough strengths of disorder the diffusive motion of the electron will come to a halt . in particular , anderson studied an unperturbed lattice of uncoupled sites , where the perturbation was considered to be the coupling between them , and randomness was introduced in the on - site energies . for this model he showed that for a large degree of randomness , the transmission of a wave decays exponentially with the length of the lattice .",
    "this absence of wave diffusion in disordered mediums is nowadays called * anderson localization * , and is a general wave phenomenon that applies to the transport of different types of classical or quantum waves , like electromagnetic , acoustic and spin waves .",
    "its origin is the wave interference between multiple scattering paths ; _",
    "i.e.  _ the introduction of randomness can drastically disturb the constructive interference , leading to the halting of waves .",
    "anderson localization plays an important role in several physical phenomena .",
    "for example , the localization of electrons has dramatic consequences for the conductivity of materials , since the medium no longer behaves like a metal , but becomes an insulator when the strength of disorder exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "this transition is often referred as the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) .",
    "often theoretical and numerical approaches of localization start with the anderson model : a standard tight - binding ( _ i.e .",
    "_ nearest - neighbor hopping ) with an on - site potential disorder .",
    "this can be represented in one dimension by a time - dependent schrdinger model @xmath0 here @xmath1 are the random on - site energies , which are drawn from an uncorrelated uniform distribution in @xmath2 $ ] , where @xmath3 parametrizes the disorder strength .",
    "the @xmath4 is the complex wavefunction associated with lattice site @xmath5 . using the substitution @xmath6 yields a time - independent form @xmath7 the solution consists of both a set of eigenvectors called the * normal modes * ( nms ) , @xmath8 , ( normalized as @xmath9 ) , and also a set of eigenvalues called the normal frequencies , @xmath10 $ ] which exist in a spectral band of width @xmath11 .",
    "the eigenvectors are exponentially localized , meaning that their _ asymptotic behavior _ can be described by an exponential decay @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a characteristic energy - dependent length , called the _",
    "localization length_. naturally , @xmath14 corresponds to an extended eigenstate .",
    "several approaches have been developed for the evaluation of @xmath15 , such as : the transfer matrix method , schemes based on the transport properties of the lattice , and perturbative techniques . for more information on such approaches , the reader is referred to @xcite and references therein . in general , these approaches approximate the localization length as @xmath16 for weak disorder strengths , @xmath17 . on average , the localization volume ( _ i.e .",
    "_ spatial extent ) @xmath18 of the nm is on order of @xmath19 for these weak disorder strengths , and tends to unity in the limit of strong disorder .    in real experiments , measurements of transmission and conductivity",
    "are mainly performed , so the need for a connection between the conductivity and the spectrum becomes apparent .",
    "the basic approach towards the fulfillment of this goal was the establishment of a connection between the conductivity and the sensitivity to changes of the boundary conditions of the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian of a finite ( but very large ) system @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity to the boundary conditions turned out to be conceptually important for the formulation of a scaling theory for localization @xcite .",
    "the main hypothesis of this single - parameter scaling theory is that close to the transition between localized and extended states , there should be only one scaling variable which should depend on the conductivity for the metallic behavior , and the localization length for the insulating behavior .",
    "this single parameter turned out to be a dimensionless conductance ( often called _",
    "thouless conductance _ or _ thouless number _ ) defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the average energy shift of eigenvalues of a finite system of size @xmath22 due to the change in the boundary conditions , and @xmath23 is the average spacing of the eigenvalues . for localized states and large @xmath22",
    ", @xmath21 becomes very small and @xmath24 exponentially vanishes . in the metallic regime",
    "the boundary conditions always influence the energy levels , even in the limiting case of infinite systems .",
    "the introduction of the thouless conductance led to the formulation of a simple criterion for the occurrence of anderson localization : @xmath25 . in one and two - dimensional random media this criterion",
    "can be reached for any degree of disorder by just increasing the size of the medium , while in higher dimensions a critical threshold exists .",
    "the experimental observation of anderson localization is not easy , for example due to the electron - electron interactions in cases of electron localization , and the difficult discrimination between localization and absorption in experiments of photon localization .",
    "nevertheless , nowadays the observation of anderson localization has been reported in several experiments , a few of which we quote here . in @xcite localization of light in three - dimensional random media",
    "was reported .",
    "anderson localization has also been observed in experiments of transverse localization of light for two @xcite and one @xcite dimensional photonic lattices .",
    "anderson localization has also been observed in experiments of localization of a bose - einstein condensate in an one - dimensional optical potential @xcite , and of elastic waves in a three - dimensional disordered medium @xcite .",
    "in addition , the observation of the mit in a three - dimensional model with atomic matter waves has been reported @xcite .",
    "another intriguing class of problems appears when replacing the disorder potential @xmath26 by a dc field @xmath27 ( @xmath28 denotes the strength of the field ) . as an example",
    ", one can mention the textbook solid state problem of an electron in a periodic potential with an additional electric field ( see e.g. @xcite ) which leads to investigations of bloch oscillations @xcite and landau - zener tunneling @xcite in different physical systems . nowadays ,",
    "such effects are experimentally observed employing optical waves in photonic lattices @xcite and ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite . if the well depth of the periodic potential is large enough , landau - zener tunneling is suppressed , the problem is discretized ( wannier - stark ladder ) and the resulting eigenvalue problem is explicitly solved in terms of the localized eigenmodes of the system ( see _ e.g.  _",
    "@xcite ) . let us consider a discrete linear schrdinger equation , as in eq.([eq : anderson ] ) but now with a dc bias @xmath28 : @xmath29 note this is the governing equation _",
    "e.g.  _ for dilute bose - einstein condensate dynamics in a deep and biased optical potential , whereby @xmath30 has a meaning of bec density in the @xmath5-th potential well . here",
    "also @xmath4 is a site s complex amplitude , and the same substitution as in eqs.([eq : anderson],[eq : schrodinger ] ) can be made to arrive at the eigenvalue problem @xmath31 in the case of an infinite lattice , this yields eigenvalues of @xmath32 ( with integer @xmath33 ) .",
    "these eigenvalues form an equidistant spectrum which extends over the whole real axis - the wannier - stark ladder .",
    "the corresponding normal modes obey the generalized translational invariance @xmath34 @xcite and are given by the bessel functions of the first kind , @xmath35 .",
    "all normal modes are spatially localized with an asymptotic decay of @xmath36 the eigenstates are thus more strongly localized as compared to the disordered case , where the eigenstates decay exponentially .",
    "remarkably , various observables exhibit temporal periodic motion ( bloch oscillations ) with the period @xmath37 .",
    "the localization volume of an eigenstate is determined via @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "it characterizes the spatial extent of the eigenstate as a function of @xmath28 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lin_stark ] , the localization volume of an eigenstate is shown as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior was found to be @xmath39^{-1}$ ] for @xmath40 , and @xmath41 for @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "a periodic lattice gives a translational symmetry . a simple way to destroy",
    "the symmetry is to introduce a secondary periodic lattice of a different and incommensurate frequency .",
    "this idea has gained much attention in solid - state via _ quasicrystals _  @xcite .",
    "the idea of incommensuration also extends into optics via sequenced ( _ e.g .",
    "_ fibonacci , thue - morse , rudin - shapiro ) potentials  @xcite .",
    "more so , it has recently been focused upon in ultracold atomic physics , in terms of _ bichromatic _ lattices  @xcite .",
    "regardless of the subfield , for large lattices the dynamics is described in a tight - binding form - as in eqs.([eq : anderson],[eq : lin_stark ] ) - and goes by the moniker of _ aubry - andr model _ @xmath43 in which the parameter @xmath44 dictates the commensurability ratio between the two different frequencies .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 dictates a relative lattice strength , much as @xmath3 for the disordered anderson model . as in eqs.([eq : schrodinger],[eq : lin_stark_eigen ] ) , a substitution is made to turn eq.([eq : harper ] ) into an eigenvalue problem : @xmath46 originally this model was introduced by harper  @xcite ( hence eq.([eq : harper ] ) is also synonymously the _ harper model _ ) to describe a low - temperature two - dimensional electron gas in a high magnetic field , in which the parameter @xmath44 describes incommensurability between the quantum of magnetic flux and the lattice cell .",
    "it is commonplace to make the lattice as largely incommensurate as possible for studies in the aubry - andr model ; the inverse golden mean is often used @xmath47 .",
    "we shall henceforth keep with this standard convention . using the fourier form @xmath48 , eq.([eq : harper ] )",
    "transforms into the quasi - momentum basis of @xmath49 @xmath50 note that eqs.([eq : harper],[eq : harper_trans ] ) are * not * identical , as seen in the location of the @xmath45 parameter .",
    "eq.([eq : harper ] ) dictates dynamics in a position representation and @xmath45 occurs on the on - site energy terms , while eq.([eq : harper_trans ] ) dictates dynamics in a momentum representation , and @xmath45 appears in the kinetic coupling of the momentum modes . even though the two equations are strictly different , under exchange of @xmath45 the two equations are equivalent in form - a property know as _ self - duality",
    "_ , first derived by aubry and andr @xcite .",
    "both equations easily can be seen to be equivalent without any parameter exchange if @xmath51 .",
    "this self - dual symmetry is nicely observed in the eigenstates . for the critical value of @xmath51 , the two representations have identical localization lengths .",
    "additionally , the localization volumes can be probed as in the prior section , using either @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : harper_ipr ] .",
    "in the figure , for small @xmath45 states localized in position space are extended in momentum space .",
    "as @xmath45 sweeps across @xmath51 , the strong transition from localized to extended is seen for @xmath54 ( and vice - versa for @xmath55 ) .",
    "the value @xmath56 is thus tied strongly to criticality and fractality of eigenstates , whose existence in quasiperiodic models has been quite an active hotbed . in terms of the aubry - andr model ,",
    "this has focused on changes in the density of states  @xcite , density - density correlations  @xcite , husimi / wigner distributions  @xcite , and spreading of density moments  @xcite .",
    "the aubry - andr model has also seen modification by another parameter @xmath33 , introduced in eq.([eq : harper ] ) as @xmath57 , in order to further probe and control the mobility edge @xcite .",
    "study of the aubry - andr model continues onward , beyond simple tight - binding formalisms @xcite .",
    "there is a growing interest in the study of quantum systems with time - dependent hamiltonians .",
    "an important motivation in this area is better understanding of the quantum dynamics within simple systems whose classical counterparts exhibit chaotic behavior .",
    "one of the relatively simple models to study the quantum dynamics is a quantum kicked rotor .",
    "this model was introduced in @xcite as a quantum analog of _ the standard mapping _",
    "@xcite , which is the basic model of dynamical chaos in the classical limit . in spite of this formal analogy ,",
    "the dynamical chaos in the quantum kicked rotor exhibits some specific features closely related with the quantum nature of the underlying model .",
    "namely , in the classical case the motion depends on a single parameter , @xmath58 , the dimensionless strength of kick . for each value of @xmath58",
    "the motion can be quasi - periodic , chaotic , or accelerating , depending on the initial conditions . at small @xmath58",
    "the chaotic regions are isolated and separated by the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) trajectories ; consequently the motion is bounded .",
    "for @xmath59 the last of these trajectories disappears and diffusion in the momentum space takes place . on the other hand , in the quantum case",
    "the energy remains bounded and does not increase with time even for @xmath60 .",
    "in other words , the quantum suppression of classical diffusion in the phase space has taken place in the model of quantum kicked rotor @xcite .",
    "the quantum localization of classical chaotic diffusion is sometimes called _ dynamical localization_. this phenomenon is in many aspects analogous to anderson localization in the models with disorder @xcite . however , in the case of quantum chaos there is no randomness and transient diffusion in the corresponding classical system . in other words ,",
    "the dynamical localization in a quantum kicked rotor occurs in a completely deterministic system .",
    "in addition , in the cases where the period of kicks equals to an integer multiple of the natural period of rotor , quantum resonances and ballistic diffusion occur .",
    "the quantum kicked rotor is described by the schrdinger equation : @xmath61 here , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the position and the conjugated momentum operators of the rotor .",
    "all quantities are in units of @xmath64 , and the motion is considered on a ring with periodic boundary conditions @xmath65 .",

    "the evolution operator over one period @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 the solution @xmath69 of eq.([this01 ] ) can be expanded in the basis of the angular momentum eigenfunctions in a form @xmath70 where the coefficients @xmath71 are the fourier coefficients of the time - dependent wave function @xmath69 . as a result of the action of the evolution operator , eq.([this11 ] ) , on the wave function @xmath69 over one period @xmath67 , the following mapping of the fourier coefficients @xmath72",
    "is obtained @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the bessel function of the first order @xcite .",
    "it is found from eq.([this31 ] ) that - opposite to the classical model where one parameter determines the system behavior - in the quantum model , behavior depends on two parameters : @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the perturbation strength @xmath66 gives the effective number of unperturbed states covered by one kick , and @xmath67 is ratio between the period of kicks @xmath67 and the natural period of rotor , set to one in this case .",
    "when the ratio between these two periods is rational ( _ i.e .  _",
    "@xmath67 is a rational number ) , the rotor energy @xmath75 , grows ballistically in time as @xmath76 , at variance to the classical case .",
    "this phenomenon is called quantum resonance ( being caused by pure quantum interference effects ) and has no relation to the classical behavior @xcite . on the other hand , for irrational",
    "@xmath67 , suppression of the energy diffusion occurs and the spreading of the wave packet stops .",
    "eq.([this31 ] ) can be also treated as an eigenvalue problem @xmath77 the complex eigenvectors are localized for irrational @xmath67 ; @xmath78 .",
    "the characteristic eigenvalues @xmath79 are complex numbers placed on the unit circle in the complex plane , @xmath80 . for rational @xmath67 then , extended eigenvectors are obtained .",
    "one of the first experimentally - grounded evidences of localization in a quantum system ( which leads to the suppression of the chaotic diffusion in the action space ) was obtained with hydrogen atoms in a microwave field @xcite .",
    "the quantum energy spectrum of this system - which consists of excited hydrogen atoms inside an intense time dependent magnetic field - is investigated in the regime when underlying classical motion has passed from regular to irregular behavior , via increasing magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "the first experimental realization of the quantum kicked rotor was obtained in a sample of dilute ultracold sodium atoms in a periodic standing wave of near - resonant light , pulsed periodically in time to approximate a series of delta kicks @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "atomic momenta were measured as a function of interaction time and the pulse period .",
    "the diffusive growth of energy up to a quantum break time , followed by dynamical localization , was observed .",
    "in addition , in cases with the pulse period equal to an integer multiple of the rotor period , the ballistic diffusion and corresponding quantum resonances were observed .",
    "all these experimental findings confirmed previously established numerical and theoretical predictions of the quantum kicked rotor model .",
    "a number of recent studies have been devoted to uncover the interplay of nonlinearity and disorder  @xcite .",
    "most of these studies consider the evolution of an initially localized wave packet .",
    "while the linear equations will trap the packet , the presence of nonlinearity leads to a spreading of the packet way beyond the limits set by the linear theory .",

    "as recently argued by johansson , _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite , these states may be localized for infinite times and correspond to kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) torus structures in phase space .",

    "if now @xmath123 , self - trapping is avoided , and the wave packet can start to spread . for @xmath124 , the packet will spread over the localization volume during the time @xmath125 ( even for @xmath126 ) . at that time",

    "as seen , particular attention needs paid in choosing the initial condition . with the introduction of nonlinearity , the aubry - andr model remains a cornucopia of study .",
    "realizations of bose - einstein condensation of dilute gases has opened new opportunities for experimental study of dynamical systems in the presence of many - body interactions . in the mean field approximation ,",

    "the influence of nonlinearity on quantum localization in the nonlinear quantum kicked rotor can be studied by direct numerical simulation of the corresponding model , eq.([this0 ] ) . the correct approach to approximate the evolution of the nonlinear schrdinger equation is to evaluate the nonlinear term in the position representation @xcite .",

    "the typical values of the number of steps per period are between @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "therefore , this model is computationally quite expensive to study the effects of strong nonlinearities and the dynamics of the system over long time @xcite .    another much simpler model of the quantum kicked nonlinear rotor - which allows faster performance and more efficient numerical computations - was introduced by shepelyansky @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of this model is given by the following map : @xmath240 this map is almost the same as that without nonlinearity , eq.([this31 ] ) .",

    "namely , in the presence of strong enough nonlinearity , subdiffusive spreading is observed @xcite .",
    "this effect of nonlinearity in the quantum kicked rotor is similar to those obtained in the models with disorder , as discussed in the previous sections . in the case of",
    "the quantum kicked rotor , the role of disorder is played by the quasiperiodic sequence @xmath243 , which is obtained for irrational @xmath67 .",
    "replacement of this quasiperiodic sequence with a truly random one shows no change in the behavior of the system .",
    "this favors the expectations that the influence of nonlinearity can be described by the same theory developed in the context of the models with disorder .",

    "[ sec : basic ] ) , which quantifies the wave packet sparsity , oscillates around values of @xmath244 for the quantum kicked rotor model .",
    "this means that the wave packet spreads in a compact fashion .",
    "in addition , preliminary results indicate different subdiffusive spreading regimes with respect to the values of the coefficient of nonlinearity @xmath85 and the strength of the kick @xmath66 .",
    "we expect that these results can be explained by the existence of different spreading regimes of the wave packet , as in sec .",

    "currently , our recent efforts have been dedicated to establishing more clear and reliable results .",
    "a variety of linear wave equations support wave localization .",
    "many of them were experimentally studied in recent times .",
    "the localization phenomenon relies on the phase coherence of waves .",
    "therefore , destruction of phase coherence - dephasing - leads to a loss of wave localization .",
    "nonlinear wave equations are in general nonintegrable , and therefore admit dynamical chaos .",
    "dynamical chaos in turn leads to a loss of correlations - and therefore dephasing .",
    "consequently wave propagation in nonlinear wave equations will generically lead to delocalization .",
    "we discussed a number of results on wave packet propagation which support this conclusion .",
    "nonlinearity is the result of wave interactions , and a generic phenomenon in many physical realizations as well .",
    "therefore , future experimental studies are expected to confirm these predictions .",
    "besides wave packet propagation , conductivity measurements are informative as well .",
    "in particular , the temperature dependence of the heat conductivity has been recently related directly to the properties of wave packet propagation @xcite .",
    "there are many future research directions the mind can take .",
    "extensions to higher lattice dimensions are of interest .",
    "two - dimensional lattices are numerically feasible , while three - dimensional cases need most probably the support of supercomputers .",
