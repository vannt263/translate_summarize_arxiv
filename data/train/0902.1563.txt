    "billiard models have played an important role in mathematical physics for forty years , since their introduction by sinai in @xcite , motivated by the boltzmann ergodic hypothesis on fluids of hard spheres .",
    "they are a class of models which are accessible and of interest both to mathematicians @xcite and to physicists @xcite . in particular , they have attracted much attention as simple models of physical systems which exhibit strong chaotic properties ( hyperbolicity , ergodicity and mixing )    in classical billiards , particles travel freely between collisions with hard , fixed boundaries",
    ". they then collide _ elastically _",
    ", i.e.  without friction , so that the kinetic energy is conserved .",
    "such billiards can thus be considered as a type of hamiltonian system with discontinuities .",
    "our objective is to investigate , mainly numerically , the different types of dynamics which occur in billiard tables with a _ modified _ collision rule : we consider _ pinball billiards _ , where the reflection rule at collisions is no longer elastic . rather , the angle ( with respect to the normal ) of reflection is smaller than the angle of incidence , by a constant factor .",
    "the dynamics is then no longer conservative ; rather , there is contraction in phase space , which gives rise to attractors .",
    "two types of attractors are found to occur : they are either ( i ) periodic points whose stability matrix has eigenvalues with modulus not greater than one , or ( ii ) non - trivial invariant sets that exhibit _ dominated splitting _ ( defined below ) .",
    "both types of attractors can coexist , and we study examples where all possible cases occur .    rather than attempt to model a particular physical scenario , we consider a model that interpolates between a one - dimensional dynamics , where reflection is always normal to the boundary , and a hamiltonian one ( elastic reflection ) .",
    "a related modified billiard collision rule , which was motivated by physical considerations , was studied recently in @xcite .",
    "other hamiltonian systems with dissipation have been studied from a similar point of view , for example the kicked rotor map @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the dynamical properties of orbits in the forward limit set of the system , that is , the union of all @xmath4-limit sets of points in the space , which describes the dynamics of the system as the time goes to @xmath5 .",
    "markarian , pujals and sambarino @xcite proved that , under certain circumstances , case ( ii ) , that is the ocurrence of non - trivial invariant sets with dominated splitting , appears in many common billiard tables . in our context , an invariant subset @xmath6 of the limit set has _ dominated splitting _",
    "if the tangent bundle continuously splits into two non - trivial invariant sub - bundles under the derivative , say @xmath7 , and there are @xmath8 and @xmath9 such that @xmath10 for any @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in these circumstances one can expect @xcite that the limit set can be decomposed into the union of three subsets : ( 1 ) a finite union of disjoint invariant curves formed by periodic points with finite period ; ( 2 ) a finite union of simple closed curves where the dynamic is conjugate to an irrational rotation ; and ( 3 ) a disjoint union of finitely many compact invariant hyperbolic sets . in this paper",
    "we restrict attention to tables with _ focusing _ boundaries . a focusing boundary ( which has negative curvature under our convention ) has the property that a beam of parallel trajectories which hits it focuses after the collision .",
    "bunimovich showed @xcite that if there is `` enough space '' in the billiard table , then after it has focused , the beam can then defocus , before it collides again .",
    "this _ defocusing mechanism _ can give rise to strong chaotic properties , in particular hyperbolicity @xcite and to systems which are ergodic and mixing , see for instance @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one of the motivations of this work is to study pinball billiard maps defined on tables which in some sense are close to the limit of validity of the hypotheses assumed in @xcite for which rigorous results could be obtained .",
    "we consider cases in which either the attractor is not contained in a compact region of the phase space , or certain geometrical properties used in that reference do not hold . in this way , we shed light on the interesting types of behaviour which pinball billiards can exhibit .",
    "we begin by defining formally the dynamical system , and then proceed to study numerically the dynamics in several different types of billiard table with focusing ( and in one case neutral ) boundaries .",
    "the aim of the paper is to characterise the types of attractor that can be expected to occur in pinball billiards , and relate them to the geometric features of the billiard table . in particular",
    ", there is a competition between the defocusing mechanism and the angle contraction in the pinball dynamics .",
    "the tables we consider are the family of ellipses , the cardioid , a modified , convex version of the cardioid with a discontinuity in the curvature , and a smooth family of perturbations of the circle . in the ellipse",
    ", it is found that the limit set is always periodic and it can either have dominated splitting or not , depending on whether certain eigenvalues are real or complex . in the cardioid ,",
    "the limit set always consists of a chaotic attractor which accumulates on the vertex .",
    "we then introduce a modified , convex version of the cardioid , in which the vertex is removed .",
    "there we find that the limit set consists of periodic or chaotic attractors , and for some values of the contraction parameter these two phenomena coexist .",
    "here there are two points where the curvature is discontinuous , and the chaotic attractor contains trajectories which include these points . finally , in a smooth family of perturbations of the circle we observe coexistence of periodic and chaotic attractors , which undergo bifurcations when the contraction parameter is varied .",
    "let @xmath13 be an open , bounded , simply - connected subset of the plane , whose boundary @xmath14 consists of a finite number of compact @xmath15 curves @xmath16 .",

    "we introduce coordinates @xmath23 on the phase space @xmath20 , where @xmath24 is the arc length parameter along @xmath14 and @xmath25 is the angle between the reflected vector @xmath26 and the normal @xmath18 , satisfying @xmath27 . in classical billiards",
    "the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection ( elastic reflection ) @xcite ; in this case , the billiard map is area - preserving in terms of the coordinates @xmath28 , known as birkhoff coordinates .",
    "recently , markarian , pujals and sambarino @xcite introduced _ pinball billiards _ , which are billiard maps with a modified reflection rule .",

    "in pinball billiards we no longer restrict to the elastic case ; rather , we allow the outgoing angle @xmath25 to depend on the incidence angle @xmath32 . in principle , a dependence could be allowed on the position of the collision , as in @xcite , but we suppose that the exit angle @xmath25 depends only on the incidence angle @xmath32 . then @xmath33 , where @xmath34 \\to \\mathbb{r}$ ] is a @xmath35 function .    in @xcite ,",
    "section  3.2 of which gives more details on these topics , two perturbations on the angle of reflection were studied . in this paper",
    ", we restrict attention to one of them : we assume that @xmath36 , with constant @xmath37 ; thus @xmath38 , that is , the outgoing angle is given by a _",
    "contraction of the angle of incidence . for simplicity",
    "we rescale the speed of the particle after each collision so that it is always @xmath39 .",
    "physically this corresponds to a sticky boundary which gives exactly the right amount of `` kick '' to the particle ; this can be thought of as a caricature of what happens in a real pinball table , whence the term `` pinball billiard '' .",
    "the _ pinball billiard map _",
    "@xmath40 with a given contraction parameter @xmath41 $ ] is then defined as follows : we leave the point @xmath42 with direction @xmath43 until we intersect the boundary again at the point @xmath44 .",
    "if the unit normal @xmath45 at the new position is well defined , then the new velocity vector @xmath46 is given by the above collision rule .",
    "the pinbilliard map @xmath47 is then defined by @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath45 is not uniquely defined , for example if the trajectory lands at a sharp corner , then the map @xmath47 is not defined at @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath40 is also undefined at points @xmath50 where the trajectory hits tangentially another component of the boundary @xmath14 .",
    "removing such points from the domain of definition of the map forces us to work in a non - compact domain .",
    "this is an obstacle for the direct application of results from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath51 be the euclidean distance between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and @xmath54 be the curvature of @xmath14 at @xmath55 taken with the following convention : @xmath54 is negative if the component of the boundary is focusing , zero if it is flat , and positive if it is dispersing .",
    "zero curvature is not allowed on focusing and dispersing components of the boundary . in this paper",
    "we will only study billiards with focusing and flat components , and only for @xmath56 .",
    "although it is possible to consider @xmath57 , in this case the trajectories tend to converge to `` whispering gallery '' modes tangent to the billiard boundary .",
    "the total derivative of the pinball billiard map @xmath47 at a point @xmath58 is , as shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsection 3.3 ) , given by : @xmath59 where @xmath60 again , subscript @xmath61 refers to quantities evaluated at the starting collision point , and subscript @xmath39 to quantities at the next collision .",
    "thus @xmath62 is the exit angle of the trajectory at the boundary point from which the trajectory leaves , and @xmath63 is the incidence angle at the _ next _ collision , calculated by the rule described above .",
    "the derivative thus involves information from two consecutive collisions .",
    "the stability matrix of an orbit is the product of the stability matrices of each trajectory segment . in the case of a periodic orbit ,",
    "it is sufficient to take the product over a single period .",
    "the pinball billiard map depends on the contraction parameter @xmath0 , and one of our goals is to study the global modifications ( bifurcations ) of the dynamics of @xmath47 as @xmath0 varies in the interval @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath2 the outgoing angle is equal to the incidence angle , so that @xmath65 is the classical elastic billiard map , and the measure @xmath66 is preserved .    when @xmath67 , trajectories leave exactly along the normal vector at each collision , so that @xmath68 reduces to a _",
    "one - dimensional _ map , which was named the _ slap billiard map _ in @xcite ; the derivative of @xmath68 at a point @xmath31 along the boundary is given by @xmath69 .",
    "note that the slap billiard map is in fact a map of the circle , since the arc length is a periodic variable .",
    "we emphasise that in the cases considered in this paper the curvatures @xmath54 are always non - positive .",
    "we remark that the slap billiard map is related to the geometrical concept of _ evolute _ of a curve , which is the envelope of the set of all normals to the curve .",
    "since the trajectories in the slap billiard always follow the normal vectors , the evolute is generated in configuration space .",
    "nonetheless , this seems not to be particularly relevant for the dynamical properties of the map .",
    "the simplest smooth , convex tables with focusing boundaries are elliptical tables , which are classical examples in the case of elastic billiards ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  1 ) . in this section",
    "we study pinball billiards in elliptical tables , beginning with the special case of circular tables .",
    "the tables have elliptical boundaries , parametrised as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and the shape parameter @xmath72 satisfies @xmath73 without loss of generality .",
    "the simplest case of pinball billiard dynamics occurs in a circular table , for @xmath74 .",
    "when @xmath75 , that is , for elastic collisions , the incident and outgoing angles are constant along each trajectory , due to conservation of angular momentum , and the phase space is foliated by parallel lines corresponding to constant angles .",
    "this system is thus completely regular ( integrable ) .    for @xmath76",
    ", however , at each collision the exit angle @xmath77 decreases , so that the outgoing trajectory is closer to the diameter which corresponds to the normal direction at the point of collision .",
    "this continues at each collision ; since there is no counter - effect , the trajectory from any initial condition converges to some period-@xmath78 diametrical orbit , as shown in figure  [ fig : circle - ellipse - config](a ) .",
    "any diameter is a limit set , and the exact limiting behaviour depends on the initial conditions .    in @xcite it is proved that for @xmath79 the limit set of the pinball billiard in a circular table has dominated splitting .",
    "this limit set consists of the line @xmath80 $ ] , the set of all period-@xmath78 orbits .",
    "the slap billiard map of a circular table corresponds to a translation by @xmath81 on the circle : @xmath82 , that is , each point @xmath24 is mapped to the diametrically opposed point @xmath83 and then back , so that each point is periodic with period @xmath78 .",
    "new dynamical features appear when we break the circular symmetry and consider an ellipse with non - zero eccentricity .",
    "an ellipse has exactly two periodic orbits of period @xmath78 , lying along its major and minor axes .",
    "however , these two periodic orbits are found to have different stability properties under the pinbilliard dynamics : the orbit lying along the minor axis is _ stable _ , whereas the orbit lying along the major axis is _ unstable _ : an initial condition pointing along the major axis stays there forever , whereas an initial condition starting arbitrarily close to it leaves the neighbourhood of the major axis and eventually converges to the stable orbit , as shown in figure  [ fig : circle - ellipse - config](b ) .",
    "the complete description of the dynamics is that there is one stable and one unstable period-2 orbit and they form the limit set of the pinball billiard transformation , for all @xmath84 . with the exception of the unstable orbit ,",
    "all other trajectories are attracted by the stable one .      to confirm the results on the stability of the period-@xmath78 orbits ,",
    "we calculate explicitly their stability matrices .",
    "the curvature of the ellipse boundary at the point @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 ^{3/2 } } \\ ] ] thus the curvature at the points of the ellipse lying on the major axis is @xmath87 , and on the minor axis is @xmath88 .",
    "the stability matrix of the periodic orbit of period @xmath78 along the minor axis , for contraction parameter @xmath0 , is the product of the stability matrices for the two flights of the orbit , and is found to be @xmath89   / a^{4 } \\quad &   2 ( 1 + \\lambda ) ( a^2 - 2 )   /   a^{2 } \\\\",

    "furthermore , @xmath93 when @xmath94 , since the orbit is elliptic in the elastic case @xmath2 .",
    "the eigenvalues change type from complex to real when @xmath95 crosses @xmath61 .",
    "this occurs when @xmath96 , for any @xmath41 $ ] . for @xmath97",

    "@xmath106 below the graph of @xmath107 , both @xmath108 are real and the dynamics is then that of a stable node ; above this graph , both eigenvalues have non - trivial imaginary part .",
    "these eigenvalues are shown for the case @xmath109 in figure  [ fig : ellipse - evals ] .",
    "note that the absolute value of the eigenvalues must reach @xmath39 when @xmath2 , since the orbit is elliptic in the elastic case .",
    "the stability of the other period-@xmath78 orbit , along the major axis , can be found by inverting the geometry .",
    "a computation shows that both eigenvalues @xmath110 are real , with @xmath111 .",
    "hence the major axis is always an unstable period-@xmath78 orbit for @xmath3 .    in our two - dimensional setting ,",
    "the first requirement to have a set with dominated splitting is the existence of two different non - trivial invariant directions for @xmath112 .",
    "thus , if the limit set contains a periodic point with non - real eigenvalues , then this set can not have dominated splitting . on the other hand ,",
    "if the limit set consists of only a finite number of hyperbolic periodic orbits with real eigenvalues , then the limit set does have dominated splitting.hence , for any @xmath73 there is a number @xmath113 such that the limit set of @xmath40 has dominated splitting if @xmath114 $ ] and does not have dominated splitting for @xmath115 .",
    "the slap billiard map @xmath68 for an elliptical table with @xmath116 is shown in figure  [ fig : slap - ellipse ] , together with its second iterate .",
    "we use the polar angle @xmath117 of the collision point instead of the arc length along the ellipse , since it is simpler to calculate . in the configuration space (",
    "not shown ) , all trajectories of the slap billiard map are tangent to the evolute of the ellipse , which is a stretched astroid ( the lam curve ) .    on the graph of @xmath118 can be seen the two unstable period-@xmath78 points lying on the major axis ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) , and the two stable period-@xmath78 orbits on the minor axis .",
    "the slap billiard map of any elliptic table is not an expanding map , which agrees with the absence of chaotic behaviour in the dynamics .",
    "the results of @xcite suggest that pinball billiards may have much more complicated limit sets than just attracting periodic orbits , in particular non - trivial invariant sets with hyperbolic dynamics . from here on we search for more complicated dynamics .    in this section",
    "we study pinball billiards in the cardioid , parametrised by the equation @xmath121 in polar coordinates @xmath122 , with @xmath123 .",
    "the standard , elastic billiard dynamics in a cardioid has been studied extensively @xcite , and in particular has been proved to be hyperbolic , ergodic and mixing .",
    "robnik @xcite studied the existence , stability and bifurcations of periodic orbits in a class of billiards which includes the cardioid , with the focus being the transition from regular dynamics in the circle to stochastic dynamics in the cardioid .",
    "here we rather study the dynamics in this single table when we vary the contraction parameter @xmath0 between the one - dimensional map and area - preserving cases .    for the cardioid , the arc length @xmath124 up to an angle @xmath117 , measured from the positive @xmath125-axis , can be evaluated exactly as @xmath126 for @xmath127 .",
    "thus @xmath128 is the rightmost ( flattest ) point of the cardioid , positive values of @xmath24 correspond to the top half of the cardioid , and the cusp is at @xmath129 .",
    "this @xmath24 is used as the abscissa in the phase space plots below .",
    "some details of the numerical algorithm used to follow the dynamics are given in the appendix .",
    "the curvature of the boundary may be evaluated using the standard expression in polar coordinates : @xmath130^{3/2}}. \\label{eq : curvature - polar}\\ ] ] the negative sign here corresponds to our convention that focusing boundaries have @xmath131 .",
    "the curvature of the cardioid is then @xmath132 .",
    "numerical evidence shows the existence of a non - trivial _ chaotic attractor _ for any @xmath133 , as shown in figure  [ fig : cardioidattractor ] .",
    "the attractor grows in phase space as @xmath0 increases , until it fills the whole of phase space uniformly when @xmath2 . here and in the rest of the paper ,",
    "the angular coordinate in phase space is shown as @xmath134 .",
    "we remark that points which are arbitrarily close to the singularity @xmath135 at the cusp of the cardioid ( corresponding to @xmath129 ) seem to belong to the attractor .",
    "however , since the cusp does not belong to the domain of the pinball billiard map , since the normal vector is not uniquely defined there , the attractor does not lie in a compact region of phase space .",
    "thus theorem 5 of @xcite can not be automatically applied .",
    "however , the dominated splitting behaviour foreseen by theorem 4 of that reference is suggested by the following computations .",
    "the trajectory emanating from ( almost ) any initial condition is found numerically to have two lyapunov exponents @xmath136 , with @xmath137 , i.e.  they are uniformly bounded away from zero for any @xmath138 $ ] .",
    "the numerical calculation of these lyapunov exponents is summarised in the appendix , and the results are shown in figure  [ fig : cardioidlyapunovexponents ] .",
    "due to the dissipative nature of the dynamics , there is contraction in phase space , which implies that @xmath139 .",
    "each point on the graph , for a fixed value of @xmath0 , is an average over @xmath140 initial conditions .",
    "the lyapunov exponents evaluated along the different trajectories are found to vary little ",
    "error bars are of the size of the symbols .",
    "this , together with visualisations of the attractor for different initial conditions , suggests that there is transitive behaviour on the attractor , i.e.  that any initial condition on the attractor visits the whole attractor .",
    "these numerical results lead us to conjecture that the system is in fact _ non - uniformly hyperbolic _ in the sense of pesin , i.e.  almost every point has non - zero lyapunov exponents ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  9.2 )",
    ". however , rigorous proofs of such conjectures are notoriously difficult @xcite .      in configuration space ,",
    "all trajectories of @xmath141 are tangent to the evolute of the cardioid , which is a mirror image of the cardioid scaled by a factor of @xmath142 ( not shown ) .",
    "the slap billiard map of the cardioid is interesting in that it has regions , close to the point @xmath128 of minimal curvature , where the derivative @xmath143 is less than one , and other parts where it is greater than one , as shown in figure  [ fig : cardioidslap ] .",
    "nonetheless , as the figure shows , the second iterate @xmath118 of this map is _ piecewise expanding _",
    ", i.e.  its derivative is uniformly bounded away from @xmath39 , with @xmath144 everywhere .",
    "this confirms the strong chaotic properties of the dynamics , and suggests a situation analogous to that in theorem  12 of @xcite with focusing walls , which states that under these conditions there should be a finite number of expansive attractors .",
    "in fact , numerically we find that the dynamics of the map seems to be ergodic .",
    "in the previous two sections , we have studied tables which show completely regular and completely chaotic behaviour , both for elastic and pinball billiard dynamics . in this section and the following one , we consider two convex tables which exhibit a complicated mixture of phenomena . here",
    "we begin with a convexified version of the cardioid , obtained by flattening the cusp of the cardioid .",
    "to do so , we remove the part of the cardioid with @xmath145 \\cup[\\frac{2 \\pi}{3 } , \\pi]$ ] , and replace it by a vertical line at @xmath146 between @xmath147 .",
    "this procedure gives a convex table which is smooth at all points except for these two joins , where the curve is only @xmath148 and has discontinuous curvature .",
    "again the arc length can be evaluated exactly .",
    "we now take @xmath128 as corresponding to the centre of the vertical line at the left of the table , and the rightmost point being at @xmath149 , where @xmath150 .",
    "the discontinuities are then at @xmath151 .    by unfolding this `` cuspless cardioid '' by reflection in the vertical line ,",
    "we obtain an equivalent table which satisfies wojtkowski s defocusing condition @xcite , and is thus hyperbolic and ergodic in the classical case of elastic collisions @xcite . however , this unfolding process is no longer valid in the case of pinball billiards , since the outgoing angle is modified at each collision with the vertical line .    from the point of view of pinball dynamics , the dynamics always has dominated splitting ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4 ) .",
    "this is verified later , by computing lyapunov exponents . however , once again the phase space is not compact .",
    "thus the results of @xcite can be immediately applied only if the attractor is contained in a compact subset of the phase space .",
    "this is the case for @xmath0 close to zero .",
    "however , a non - trivial attractor is observed only for larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , it is related to the existence of points of the boundary which are not @xmath35 : generic orbits in the chaotic attractor seem to accumulate on these non - smooth points .",
    "numerical experiments show that for @xmath0 close to @xmath61 , the period-@xmath78 orbit lying in @xmath152 attracts almost all initial conditions , except for the unstable vertical period-@xmath78 orbit which is the same as in the unmodified cardioid . for @xmath0 close to @xmath39 , however , we observe a globally attracting chaotic attractor , as in the unmodified cardioid , although rather different in structure from that case .",
    "careful simulations show that in fact there is a region where the period-@xmath78 and chaotic attractors _ coexist _ : some initial conditions are attracted to the periodic orbit , and others to the chaotic attractor .",
    "figures  [ fig : cuspless - attractors - config ] and [ fig : cardioid - attractors ] show the evolution of the numerically - determined attractors as @xmath0 is varied , in configuration space and in phase space , respectively . in the following",
    "we shall explain these phenomena .",
    "we start by studying the horizontal period-@xmath78 orbit which runs along the symmetry axis @xmath152 , shown in figure  [ fig : cuspless - attractors - config](a ) .",
    "this orbit exists for any @xmath41 $ ] , but its stability depends on the eigenvalues of the stability matrix , i.e.  the derivative of @xmath153 at the point @xmath154 , which in turn depend on @xmath0 .",
    "the stability matrix is obtained by composing the stability matrices at the points @xmath125 and @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the arc length to the point opposite @xmath61 .",
    "we find that @xmath157 the eigenvalues @xmath158 of this matrix are @xmath159 both eigenvalues are real and satisfy @xmath160 , for any @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath161 for any @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the value such that that @xmath164 , i.e.  for which this eigenvalue becomes unstable .",
    "the stable orbit is visualised later for the slap map @xmath141 ( see figure  [ fig : cusplessslap ] ) .",
    "when an eigenvalue crosses @xmath165 , a period - doubling bifurcation is expected ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  7 ) .",
    "however , in this case no _ stable _ period-@xmath166 orbit emerges , which would be observed as an attractor .",
    "we expect that an _ unstable _",
    "period-@xmath166 orbit is created in this bifurcation ; presumably it could be rendered stable if the billiard table were modified to have smaller curvature around @xmath128 .      in numerical experiments ,",
    "a globally attracting chaotic attractor is observed for @xmath167 where the period-@xmath78 orbit is no longer stable .",
    "however , this chaotic attractor is also observed to persist for @xmath168 in _ coexistence _ with the attracting period-@xmath78 orbit discussed above .",
    "how and why does this chaotic attractor arise ?",
    "for @xmath0 just above @xmath169 it is observed to be very thin , and is concentrated around what appears to be a periodic orbit of period  @xmath166 joining the two points of discontinuity in the curvature ( figure  [ fig : cuspless - attractors - config](b ) ) .",
    "we search for such a period-@xmath166 orbit as follows .",
    "starting exactly at the upper discontinuity , we shoot trajectories with different initial angles @xmath25 , and follow them for four collisions .",
    "plotting the arc length @xmath24 of the collision point at the fourth collision gives figure  [ fig : cuspless - period-4 ] , for angles close to @xmath170 , which are those for which the attractor appears .",

    "since the billiard table , and hence the pinball billiard map @xmath47 , are smooth , we can invoke the implicit function theorem to show that periodic orbits , both attracting and hyperbolic , should usually be expected to persist under small enough variations both of @xmath185 and of @xmath0 .",
    "we are thus especially interested in the situations where this does not hold , that is when bifurcations occur .",

    "this single attractor then continues to expand in phase space until another crisis occurs : the chaotic attractor abruptly vanishes when @xmath261 .",
    "the reason for this is found in figure  [ fig : crisis ] , which shows the basins of attraction of the chaotic and period-@xmath187 attractors for @xmath262 , just below the crisis . as @xmath0 increases , both the chaotic attractor and the basins of the periodic attractors grow . for a slightly larger value of @xmath0 , the chaotic",

    ", we showed that discontinuities in the curvature of the table boundary can lead to the the sudden creation of a chaotic attractor .",
    "these discontinuities are also reflected in the existence of a kink structure in the resulting attractor in phase space .",

    "these can lead to chaotic attractors which then collapse by means of crises when they touch a different basin of attraction .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that in systems with dominated splitting there is another possibility in addition to periodic and chaotic attractors , namely the existence of sets diffeomorphic to a circle where the dynamics is conjugate to an irrational rotation ( for details , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  2 ) ) .",
    "we have not observed such behaviour in the models we have studied .",
    "one of the possible reasons for the absence of such behaviour is the fact that we have only used uniform contraction of the angle at collisions ; other types of collision rule are under study .",
    "this kind of behaviour could , however , perhaps be found on the boundaries which divide different basins of attraction , which are often found to be smooth one - dimensional curves , as depicted in several of the figures in this paper .",
