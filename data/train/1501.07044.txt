    "perfect fluid spheres in general relativity have almost a full century of history , dating back to schwarzschild s interior solution of 1916  @xcite , ( corresponding to a spatially uniform density with a spatially varying but isotropic pressure ) .",
    "more recently , some particularly important contributions are the delgaty  lake review article of 1998  @xcite , and the subsequent rapid ( and extensive ) development of `` algorithmic techniques '' in the first decade of the 21@xmath0 century  @xcite .    however , when it comes to dealing with _ anisotropic _ fluid spheres , ( where the radial pressure need not equal the transverse pressure ) , the situation is considerably messier .",
    "see , for instance , references  . such anisotropic fluid spheres are sometimes believed to be physically relevant for the description of neutron stars , ( see , for example , references   ) , and other compact objects , and are known to be relevant for the internal structure of gravastars  @xcite . at a pinch the formalism can also readily be adapted to anisotropic solid spheres , such as idealized spherically symmetric planets , or the possibly solid crust of a neutron star .",
    "typically one can proceed only at the high cost of making some very specific ansatz ; either for some specific metric component , or for some specific relationship between the components of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "often these ansatze are less than well physically motivated .    in the current article",
    "we shall endeavour instead to build a reasonably general theoretical model to `` mimic '' a generic anisotropic fluid sphere .",
    "we shall do this by `` mimicking '' the stress - energy of a generic anisotropic fluid sphere in terms of some linear combination of `` charged perfect fluid '' plus `` electromagnetic field '' plus `` massless scalar field '' . by construction ,",
    "the perfect fluid component in this model is automatically in internal equilibrium , with pressure ( buoyancy ) forces , electric forces , and scalar forces exactly balancing the gravitational pseudo - force .",
    "we shall investigate the extent to which such a decomposition can be carried out , the extent to which such a decomposition is ( or can be made to be ) unique , and the extent to which we can say something concerning the spacetime geometry .",
    "we shall also investigate the extent to which the classical energy conditions  @xcite are ( or can be made to be ) satisfied , and the extent to which we can pin down the ( effective ) electric charge density and scalar charge density that are used to `` mimic '' the anisotropies in the stress - energy .",
    "overall , we will seek to build a simple and straightforward theoretical model that can be usefully used to `` mimic '' a very large class of anisotropic fluid spheres .",
    "for definiteness we shall adopt the conventions that the spacetime metric is presented in the usual schwarzschild curvature coordinates @xmath1 and that in the associated orthonormal basis the _ total _ stress - energy is : @xmath2.\\ ] ]",
    "the relevant stress - energy tensors we use are utterly standard , see for instance references   and .    * for a perfect fluid we have @xmath3 * for the electromagnetic field we have @xmath4 * for the ( minimally coupled ) massless scalar field we have @xmath5    once one restricts to spherical symmetry , and adopts an orthonormal basis , the stress - energy for a perfect fluid is : @xmath6.\\ ] ] similarly , spherical symmetry plus an orthonormal basis imply that the electromagnetic field - strength tensor is : @xmath7.\\ ] ] consequently , spherical symmetry , an orthonormal basis , and tracelessness implies that the electromagnetic stress - energy is : @xmath8.\\ ] ] finally , using spherical symmetry and an orthonormal basis , for a scalar field : @xmath9.\\ ] ] consequently , the stress - energy for a massless minimally coupled scalar is : @xmath10.\\ ] ]    note that for the electromagnetic field we automatically have @xmath11 , while in contrast for the scalar field @xmath12 .",
    "it is this relative magnitude flip that is essential in mimicking an arbitrary anisotropic fluid sphere .    combining these results we now have : @xmath13",
    "then in particular @xmath14 one specific way of inverting this , ( by far the simplest ) , is to take : @xmath15 by using this decomposition we see that _ any _ static and spherically symmetric stress tensor can be mimicked by a linear superposition of @xmath16 indeed :    * if @xmath17 everywhere within the anisotropic fluid sphere , then one can get away with only using ( perfect fluid ) + ( electromagnetic ) contributions . * if @xmath18 everywhere within the anisotropic fluid sphere , then one can get away with only using ( perfect fluid ) + ( massless scalar ) contributions .",
    "note that in regions where the transverse pressure is greater than the radial pressure the model has @xmath19 , so the scalar field is constant .",
    "( we shall soon see that the scalar charge density is zero in such regions . ) in such regions @xmath20 , and the net charge inside the sphere of radial coordinate @xmath21 is simply @xmath22 . unless @xmath23 is fine - tuned so that @xmath24 , there will be a non - zero electric charge _",
    "density _ in such regions .",
    "the electrically charged perfect fluid is then subject to both electric and pressure ( buoyancy ) forces , as well as the gravitational pseudo - force . because the model is ( by construction ) static",
    ", these forces will automatically balance each other so that the model is in internal equilibrium  more details on this point below , when we discuss the generalized tov equations .",
    "if the surface of the anisotropic fluid occurs in such a region , where the transverse pressure is greater than the radial pressure , then in order to match an exterior schwarzschild geometry the electric field @xmath23 would have to be discontinuous at the surface .",
    "( that is , @xmath25 , but @xmath26 . )",
    "this implies the need for a surface charge density to cancel the immediate sub - surface electric field .",
    "this is merely a slightly unusual feature of our model , it is in no sense problematic .",
    "if one violently objects to the presence of surface charge density , then one could instead simply match the anisotropic sphere to a reissner ",
    "nordstrm spacetime ; however that would leave the anisotropic fluid sphere with a net electric charge , which we would expect to be rapidly neutralised by quite standard astrophysical processes .",
    "overall , it seems more appropriate to work with a non - zero surface charge density but net overall charge of zero .    in counterpoint , in those regions where the radial pressure is greater than the transverse pressure our model has @xmath27 ; this corresponds to both zero electric charge density _ and _ the somewhat stronger requirement that the _ net _ electric charge ( interior to this region ) be zero . since @xmath28 in such regions",
    "there will now typically be a non - zero scalar charge density .",
    "the scalar - charged perfect fluid is then subject to both scalar forces and pressure ( buoyancy ) forces , as well as the gravitational pseudo - force . because the model is ( by construction ) static",
    ", these forces will automatically balance each other  more details on this point below .",
    "if the surface of the anisotropic fluid occurs in such a region then to match an exterior schwarzschild geometry the scalar field @xmath29 must be continuous at the surface , and constant outside the anisotropic fluid sphere .",
    "the matching to an exterior schwarzschild geometry is in this case trivial .",
    "we now proceed to set up a generalized tov system of equations , ultimately based , ( as usual ) , on the covariant conservation @xmath30 of the _ total _ stress - energy .",
    "( this allows us to study the internal forces acting on the various matter components in our model , and so directly address questions of internal equilibrium . ) to do so , let us first calculate the covariant divergence for each component separately .    for a perfect fluid it is a standard result that  @xcite @xmath31 here the two terms are by construction 4-orthogonal .",
    "one of these terms relates the 4-acceleration ( in the present context , the gravitational pseudo - force ) to the pressure gradient ( buoyancy forces ) , the other ultimately provides a conservation law .    for the electro - magnetic field one",
    "has @xmath32 use of the bianchi identity for @xmath33 , and a few standard manipulations , quickly reduces this to  @xcite @xmath34 now writing this in terms of the 4-current @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the electric charge density , we have the standard lorentz force law  @xcite @xmath37 note that , simply because we have assumed everything is static , the 4-current is automatically parallel to the 4-velocity of the perfect fluid component .    for the ( minimally coupled ) massless scalar field a brief computation yields  @xcite @xmath38 now set @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the scalar charge density .",
    "then the scalar force density is given by @xmath41    finally , combine the three ( perfect  fluid ) , ( electro - magnetic  field ) , and ( scalar field ) components .",
    "_ in the absence of other forms of matter _ , because the _ total _ stress - energy must be covariantly conserved , @xmath30 , we have @xmath42 projecting this first along the fluid 4-velocity @xmath43 , and then perpendicular to @xmath43 , we have the two equations @xmath44 and @xmath45_{;b } + \\sigma_\\s \\phi_{;b } )   % \\nonumber\\\\ % & & \\qquad   - f^{ab } ( \\sigma_{\\em } v_b ) = 0 . \\label{e:2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these two equations nicely summarize how the scalar charge and electric charge interact with the perfect fluid pressure , perfect fluid density , and 4-acceleration . in particular ,",
    "recall that the spacetime ( and the matter content ) has been assumed static , ( so the timelike killing vector @xmath46 is parallel to the fluid 4-velocity @xmath47 ) .",
    "then things simplify nicely .",
    "first of all , @xmath48 , but we also have both @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this then leads to @xmath51 , and in fact the first equation ( [ e:1 ] ) is vacuous .",
    "however the second equation ( [ e:2 ] ) is very definitely non - vacuous  it simplifies only slightly to yield @xmath52_{;b } + \\sigma_\\s \\phi_{;b } )   - f^{ab } ( \\sigma_{\\em } v_b ) = 0 .",
    "\\label{e:2b}\\ ] ] this will quickly lead to the generalized tov equations .",
    "now consider again equation ( [ e:2b ] ) , and note that due to spherical symmetry the three individual pieces of this equation can point only in the radial direction .",
    "let @xmath53 be the unit vector in the radial direction . then from equation ( [ e:2b ] ) we have @xmath54_{;b } + \\sigma_\\s \\phi_{;b } ) + \\sigma_\\em e = 0.\\ ] ] but we know that if @xmath55 this must be equivalent to the usual tov system of equations @xmath56 consequently , reinstating the charge densities by taking @xmath57 , we see @xmath58 that is , the generalized tov equation is now @xmath59 supplemented by the generalized mass relation @xmath60 note that the first of these two equations explicitly and automatically balances the pressure force , electric force , and scalar force against the pseudo - force due to gravity .",
    "( this is as it must be , since we started from a static model there can be no motion of the perfect fluid component . )    since this is a tricky point let us be explicit : simply by construction the model is automatically in internal equilibrium .",
    "we can not however , as yet say whether this equilibrium is stable , neutral , or unstable  at least not without additional hypotheses , ( such as some equation of state relating pressure , the mass density , and the charge densities ) . in general ,",
    "the perfect fluid need not , of course , be homogeneous , but this was already true in the schwarzschild interior geometry of 1916 , and so should be no particular surprise in this more general context .",
    "similarly , while the schwarzschild interior solution is by construction automatically in internal equilibrium , we can not say whether this equilibrium is stable , neutral , or unstable without some additional hypothesis . in this",
    "regard the model we are adumbrating in the current article is certainly no worse than the usual models for perfect fluid spheres .",
    "this generalized system of tov equations still has to be supplemented with the equations of motion for the electromagnetic and scalar fields .",
    "specifically , for the electric field we have ( in the quite usual fashion ) @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the total net charge interior to radius @xmath21 .",
    "explicitly @xmath63 for the scalar field we have @xmath64 , which reduces to @xmath65 that is @xmath66 this can now be integrated to explicitly yield @xmath67 if one desires an explicit formula for the scalar field itself then , up to an arbitrary additive constant , we have @xmath68 this is now a complete set of differential and integral equations which uniquely determine the three - component model used to mimic the anisotropic fluid sphere .",
    "let us now consider the classical energy conditions , see for instance references . since the electromagnetic and scalar field stress energy tensors both satisfy all the classical energy conditions , it is clear that provided the fluid component satisfies the classical energy conditions , then the total stress - energy must also satisfy the energy conditions . ( the converse need not always hold . )    specifically , let us consider the nec and note that @xmath69 this implies either @xmath70 or @xmath71 therefore @xmath72 that is , if the the total stress - energy satisfies the nec , then so does the perfect fluid portion .",
    "( likewise , if the the total stress - energy violates the nec then so does the perfect fluid portion . )    similarly , consider the dec ( dominant energy condition ) .",
    "the dec requires ( among other things ) @xmath73 .",
    "now @xmath74 combining this with the previous result for the nec , we see that if the dec is satisfied for the total matter , then the dec is satisfied for the fluid component .",
    "in contrast , consider the tec ( trace energy condition , @xmath75 ) .",
    "note the tec is not fundamental physics , and was for many years abandoned  @xcite .",
    "but the tec has undergone a recent resurgence of interest , due mainly to the fact that it can nevertheless usefully be used to characterize normal laboratory matter  @xcite .",
    "we note @xmath76 then @xmath77 so if the fluid component satisfies the tec then the total matter satisfies the tec .",
    "( in this particular case , the converse need not hold . )    in summary , we see that the various classical energy conditions can quite easily be investigated in terms of the three - component model that we have set up to mimic any anisotropic fluid sphere . if there are any violations of the classical energy conditions , they are confined to the perfect fluid component of the model .",
    "so what have we accomplished here ? on the one hand , we have constructed an explicit three - component model that is capable of mimicking any anisotropic fluid sphere , with two of the components ( electro - magnetic field and scalar field ) automatically being theoretically attractive and physically well behaved ( eg , satisfying the classical energy conditions ) .",
    "it is only the perfect fluid component that has any risk of being `` exotic '' ( ie , violating one or more of the classical energy conditions ) .    on the one hand",
    "this is a very powerful result ; on the other hand it is perhaps a little too powerful .",
    "note that we are not claiming that any anisotropic fluid sphere _ is _ physically one of these three - component models , but are instead making the more modest claim that both the spacetime geometry and the total stress - energy can be successfully mimicked by one of these three - component models .",
    "we feel that this is already an interesting observation , and that these three - component models may be of some theoretical ( and maybe even practical ) interest  certainly , since our construction is entirely generic , one can eliminate the need for making any _ ad hoc _",
    "choices for the metric components or the equation of state , as is typically done for currently extant models of anisotropic fluid spheres .",
