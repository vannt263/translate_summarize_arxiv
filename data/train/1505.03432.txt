    "in many geometric problems , variables depend analytically on some parameter .",

    ", the analytical relationship between variables and parameter should be preserved at all times .",
    "therefore we need reliable algorithms for analytic continuation .",
    "consider for example the following problem of discrete differential geometry  @xcite*section  2.6 .",
    "let there be a regular discrete curve @xmath12 in @xmath13 , i.e.  a polygonal chain with distinct vertices @xmath14 .",
    "we define the _ discrete darboux transform _",
    "@xmath15 of @xmath12 with initial point @xmath16 and parameter @xmath17 as follows : for all @xmath18 , let @xmath19 be the unique point for which the cross - ratio @xmath20 it can be shown that @xmath21 is mapped to @xmath22 by a unique mbius transformation , which depends only on @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , but not on @xmath22 .",
    "hence , there exists a unique mbius transformation @xmath26 depending on @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath25 , which maps an initial point @xmath31 to the corresponding last point @xmath32 of @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , for every choice of @xmath17 , there are two choices of initial point @xmath31 ( counted with multiplicity ) such that @xmath15 is a closed polygonal chain .",
    "these are exactly the fixed points of @xmath26 or , in other words , the roots of the characteristic polynomial of @xmath26 .",
    "the vanishing of the characteristic polynomial establishes an algebraic ( particularly analytical ) relationship between @xmath25 and @xmath31 .",
    "if we want to study closed darboux transforms of a discrete curve @xmath12 for varying parameter @xmath25 using interactive software , then we must analytically continue @xmath31 .",
    "otherwise we may observe sudden jumps of @xmath31 under continuous movement of @xmath25 , which have no mathematical justification .    in practice , of course",
    ", we can not modify a parameter continuously .",
    "instead , we obtain a series of parameter values at a series of discrete points in time .",
    "we do not know how the parameter moves between sample points .",
    "a natural approach would be to interpolate linearly between consecutive parameter values ( using a time parameter in the unit interval ) .",
    "however , the segment between parameter values may contain singularities beyond which analytic continuation becomes impossible .",
    "thus it seems reasonable to analytically continue along the polygonal chain of parameter values as long as this is possible , and to deviate from that path otherwise .",
    "such a deviation can still be interpreted as a linear interpolation between consecutive parameter values if we let the time parameter run from @xmath33 to @xmath34 on an arbitrary path through the complex plane instead of restricting it to the unit interval .",
    "this is the paradigm of ` complex detours ' invented by kortenkamp and richter - gebert for their interactive geometry software cinderella  @xcite .",
    "it is described in more detail in  .",
    "essentially the same concept was conceived in the context of homotopy continuation by morgan and sommese  @xcite , who later named it the ` gamma trick '  @xcite*lemma  7.1.3 on p.  94 .",
    "once we have chosen a path for the parameter , we must determine the right value of the dependent variable at consecutive sample points .",
    "how this can be achieved may in fact be relatively easy to see for us  just determine values in a way such that there are no jumps  but hard to see for an algorithm .",
    "the tracing problem of dynamic geometry , i.e.  tracing the positions of dependent elements of a geometric construction under movement of a free element , is np - complete already for constructions that only involve points , lines through two points , intersection of lines , and angle bisectors  @xcite .",
    "the interactive geometry software cinderella currently uses a heuristic for path following .",
    "most homotopy continuation methods use a predictor - corrector approach , which is generally also heuristic . for an overview of homotopy continuation methods , consider the books by allgower and georg   or sommese and wampler  . lately",
    ", certified homotopy continuation methods have emerged  @xcite .",
    "they are based on smale s alpha theory  @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we derive a certified algorithm for analytic continuation of plane algebraic curves based on the following simple observation : due to continuity , if the parameter moves little , so does the dependent variable .",
    "hence , if we take small enough steps along the parameter path , we can choose the right value of the dependent variable based on proximity .",
    "as an application , we return to the example of continuous deformation of closed discrete darboux transforms .",
