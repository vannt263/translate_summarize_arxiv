    "the discovery of iron - based high - t@xmath3 superconductors ( fescs ) in 2008  @xcite has triggered an enormeous amount of research in solid state physics , both experimental and theoretical . since then , many new compounds have been discovered and investigated , which differ considerably in their structural details  @xcite .",
    "they all share a common structural motif , i.e. , a square lattice of fe atoms to which pnictogen or chalcogen atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated . in the case of pnictogen compounds , spacer layers such as layers of lanthanide oxides  @xcite or alkaline ( earth ) atoms",
    "@xcite between the fe planes ensure charge neutrality . in chalcogenide compounds , these layers are not necessary , leading to the structurally simplest iron - based superconductors fese and fete .",
    "recently , lu  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite synthesized lifeo@xmath0fe@xmath0se@xmath0 , i.e. , a fese compound , intercalated with lifeo@xmath0 layers , and reported a very high critical temperature of @xmath4k , comparable to that of many other high - t@xmath3 fescs , including ( mol)-fese  @xcite .",
    "together with sr@xmath0vo@xmath5feas  @xcite , and rare - earth ( ce , pr , eu ) 1111 pnictides , this is one of the few examples of a fesc with a magnetic atom in the intercalated layers .",
    "what makes this compound special is that the magnetic atom is itself iron .",
    "the iron atoms in the lifeo@xmath0 and fese layers , fe@xmath6 and fe@xmath7 , respectively , have very different properties related to their nominal charge . since fe@xmath6 is in a 3@xmath1 configuration and therefore at half filling ,",
    "correlations are very effective and may lead to a mott - insulating state for moderate values of the coulomb interaction @xmath8 and hund s coupling @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "fe@xmath7 , on the other hand , is in 3@xmath2 configuration , i.e. , well into the hund s metal regime  @xcite , where the correlated metallic state extends to much larger values of the coulomb interaction @xmath8 .",
    "this compound could thus provide two _ qualitatively _ different realizations of correlation effects due to hund s coupling in one and the same compound .",
    "the electronic structure of lifeo@xmath0fe@xmath0se@xmath0 was studied in ref .   with standard density functional calculations .",
    "the authors found an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ground state in which both layers are metallic , and argued that with the inclusion of local correlations the lifeo@xmath0 plane would become insulating , while the fese layer would exhibit a bad metallic behavior .",
    "however , no quantitative evidence for this argument was provided .    in this paper",
    ", we study the electronic structure of lifeo@xmath0fe@xmath0se@xmath0 _ including _ strong local correlations , using dft+u@xcite and dft+dmft calculations .",
    "we show that at the dft level both fe@xmath6 and fe@xmath7 exhibit a strong tendency to magnetism , leading to a double - afm ground state in which both layers are either metallic or insulating at the same time .",
    "magnetism appears extremely fragile , with many almost - degenerate configurations competing with the ground state one .",
    "this indicates a strong tendency to a _",
    "behavior , which we describe using dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "we find that in this regime the behavior of the two fe atoms is qualitatively very different , due to the different charge state : fe@xmath6 is an incipient mott insulator , while fe@xmath7 is fully into the hund s metal regime . as a result",
    ", fe@xmath6 states are almost entirely removed from the fermi level , while fe@xmath7 bands retain a strongly coherent character and form a typical fesc fermi surface .",

    "[ fig : lda_dos ] , redrawn in fig .",

    "instead , fe@xmath6 is in a strongly orbital - selective mott regime  @xcite , with 4 out of 5 orbitals being insulating , and only one ( the @xmath41 ) with some finite , but very incoherent , weight at zero energy .",
    "an increase of the interaction values for fe@xmath6 to @xmath81ev and @xmath82ev , however , results in the suppression of also the fe@xmath6 @xmath41 states from the fermi surface .",
    "we relate this to the fact that a completely incoherent state can be reached with not too large values for the interaction parameters due to the atomic configuration ( half - filled ) of the fe@xmath6 atom .",
    "however , as already discussed above , there is some intrinsic charge transfer from fe@xmath7 to fe@xmath6 in this compound .",
    "calculating the charge of the iron atoms from dft , using @xmath70-only wannier functions , gives 5.12 electrons for fe@xmath6 , which is slightly above the integer value for half filling .",
    "that means that correlations have to overcome this small charge transfer and push the fe@xmath6 closer to half filling , before a complete suppression of the fe@xmath6 contributions can take place .",
    "we presented calculations for the electronic and magnetic behavior of the recently synthesized fe - based superconductor lifeo@xmath0fe@xmath0se@xmath0 using first - principles dft methods and dft+dmft calculations .",
    "the most favourable magnetic configuration in dft has checkerboard order in the lifeo@xmath0 and single stripe order in the fese layer .",
    "when correlations in the framework of dft+u are included , the magnetic moments of fe@xmath6 and fe@xmath7 react very differently to the coulomb interaction @xmath8 . while @xmath50 of the lifeo@xmath0 layer is robust over a wide range of interactions and breaks down at a negative @xmath8 of @xmath83ev in a sharp transition , the moment @xmath51 of the fese layer changes rather smoothly with @xmath8 .",
    "we find that the pdos of fe@xmath6 and fe@xmath7 of cb - ss lifeo@xmath0fe@xmath0se@xmath0 have states at the fermi energy for @xmath84ev , while for @xmath85ev this compound is fully gapped , in contrast to previous reports  @xcite .",
    "we also observed that there are many magnetic configurations that are very close in energy to the ground state .",
    "this means that the spins are able to fluctuate as the magnetic configuration of the whole compound can change easily .",
    "the nonmagnetic dft electronic band structure is much richer compared to other fescs , due to the presence of lifeo@xmath0-derived states at the fermi level .",
    "however , the picture is strongly modified when including correlation effects by means of dft+dmft .",
    "almost all contributions from the intercalated fe@xmath6 in the lifeo@xmath0 are removed from the vicinity of the fermi energy with the exception of the fe@xmath6 3@xmath41 band .",
    "this has , however , a much smaller and incoherent weight than the contributions from fe@xmath7 , which means that the low - energy physics of lifeo@xmath0fe@xmath0se@xmath0 is governed by the fe@xmath7 of the fese layer .",
    "this low - energy electronic structure , stemming from fe@xmath7 , is very similar to what was found for bulk fese  @xcite .",
    "three hole pockets are located in the vicinity of the @xmath37-point and two electron pockets near the m - point , recovering the usual fermi surface picture of fe - based superconductors .",
    "our calculations show unambiguously that the topology of the fermi surface , even above a magnetic ordering temperature , should be very similar to the well - known pocket structure of other iron - based pnictides ; this should be immediately verifiable in arpes experiments .",
    "the striking difference between the behavior of fe@xmath6- and fe@xmath7-derived states , related to the different valences of the two atoms , is one of the most spectacular realizations so far of qualitatively different effects of hund s rule coupling , depending on the valence state of the atoms , in one single compound .",

    "<S> we perform electronic structure calculations for the recently synthesized iron - based superconductor lifeo@xmath0fe@xmath0se@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to other iron - based superconductors , this material comprises two different iron atoms in 3@xmath1 and 3@xmath2 configurations . in band theory , </S>",
    "<S> both contribute to the low - energy electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> spin - polarized density functional theory calculations predict an antiferromagnetic metallic ground state with different moments on the two fe sites . however , several other almost degenerate magnetic configurations exist . due to their different valences , </S>",
    "<S> the two iron atoms behave very differently when local quantum correlations are included through the dynamical mean - field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions from the half - filled 3@xmath1 atoms in the lifeo@xmath0 layer are suppressed and the 3@xmath2 states from the fese layer restore the standard iron - based superconductor fermiology . </S>"
