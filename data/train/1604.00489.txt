    "recent years have witnessed a rapid growth in the study of heat engines operating at the nanoscale . more generally , this area of research is increasingly progressing towards a multitude of energy efficient nano - technologies @xcite . on the experimental front",
    ", there have been several realizations of mesoscopic heat engines that employ a wide range of working fluids , albeit operating almost exclusively in the classical domain .",
    "typical examples include piezoelectric materials @xcite , colloidal systems @xcite and even a single atom @xcite , to name but a few .",
    "on the other hand , our theoretical understanding of quantum thermodynamics has undergone considerable development that has enhanced our ability to manipulate and control thermal devices at the nanoscale .",
    "for example , with the use of tailored driving protocols in various strategies collectively termed shortcuts to adiabaticity , we are equipped to generate adiabatic or adiabatic - like dynamics in systems that are driven within a finite amount of time @xcite .",
    "however their practical usefulness is conditional upon the relative timescales of the cycle and the nature of the driving fields @xcite .",
    "more recently , studies of many - body working fluids in thermodynamic cycles are providing guiding principles that can enhance the performance of quantum heat engines .",
    "for instance , quantum statistics has been shown to significantly influence the work distribution of hamiltonian processes @xcite .",
    "in particular , the interplay between quantum statistics and other properties of the working fluid such as the trap geometry @xcite and/or many - body interactions @xcite can result in augmenting the performance of a heat engine operating in the quantum regime .",
    "see @xcite for recent reviews on quantum thermodynamics and heat engines .    furthermore , our understanding of heat engines at the nanoscale has benefited from salient advances in statistical physics , namely the area of fluctuation theorems @xcite . among the various fundamental relations , we mention in particular the jarzynski equality that has been validated experimentally in the classical regime ,",
    "e.g. see refs .",
    "although presenting a formidable challenge for experiment , the jarzynski equality has also been verified also in the quantum regime @xcite .",
    "these fluctuation relations allow us to explore various peculiarities in the thermodynamic behavior of non - equilibrium heat engines @xcite .",
    "such peculiarities may arise from ( but are not limited to ) squeezed or non - thermal baths @xcite , irreversibility @xcite , finite - time effects of the driving @xcite , and more recently from the time - asymmetry used in the driving protocol @xcite .",
    "moreover , cycles that contain sudden changes in the hamiltonian parameters have also been investigated @xcite , thereby accounting for the role of noise in the cycles performance as well @xcite .    .",

    "in our analysis of the cycle , we introduce an explicit projective energy measurement which is performed before and after each stroke of the cycle , so as to determine the work via the two - time energy measurements protocol @xcite .",
    "we then explore the non - equilibrium behavior by exploring the conditions for optimal work output and efficiency of the cycle and find characteristic discontinuities as a function of the system parameters .    in section ( [ sec : model ] )",
    "we describe the otto cycle setup and detail the relevant parameters and figure of merits of the quantum engine .",
    "the otto cycle is composed of four strokes : two unitary strokes , of total time @xmath27 , intercalated by two strokes in which the system is weakly coupled to baths , for a total time @xmath28 .",
    "hence the total duration of the cycle is @xmath29 .",
    "we consider a single ion in a harmonic trap as the the working substance of the system , while each bath consists of two lasers weakly coupled to the system , which raise and lower the occupation number of the quantum harmonic oscillator at different rates .",
    "the overall effect of this weak system - bath interaction is such that after sufficient time has elapsed , the system becomes a thermal - like state at an effective temperature determined by a ratio involving the raising and lowering occupation number rates .    in section (",
    "[ sec : unitary ] ) we first analyze the limiting case of the ideal bath couplings where the system relaxes to final states that are effectively thermal - like at the end of the two dissipative strokes .    in the following section ( [ sec : dissipative ] )",
    "we generalize our study to the case of an engine cycle in which the dissipative strokes are not coupled for long enough times to bring the system to a thermal - like state .",
    "lastly , we summarize our main findings and present our conclusions in section ( [ sec : conclusions ] ) .",

    "the dissipator @xmath36 in ( [ eq : master ] ) is given by @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the raising and lowering occupation rates respectively .",
    "note that as a consequence of the protocol used for @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , the system hamiltonian does not change in time during the dissipative parts of the cycle when the external baths are acting on the system . given a fixed trapping frequency @xmath38 , the dissipator tends to drive the system towards the diagonal quantum state that assumes the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the normalized occupation probability in state @xmath41 , being the eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) and the effective inverse temperature @xmath42 of the steady state is such that @xmath43 .",

    "we would like to emphasize that although the baths considered can prepare a single ion in a thermal - like state , they do not constitute actual thermal baths .",
    "instead , they impose a certain distribution of occupation of the energy levels that is independent of the energy difference between the levels .",
    "given the non - thermal property of the baths we prefer to refer more precisely to the specific steady state of the ( time independent ) master equation as ` thermal - like ' and to @xmath42 as an ` effective ' inverse temperature .",
    "+ next we consider the operation of the quanutm otto engine in greater detail , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the cycle consists of two _ unitary _ strokes , each followed by a corresponding dissipative stroke in which the system is weakly coupled to the environment while the system parameters are held fixed ( iso - parametric processes ) @xcite .",
    "we stress that the dissipative coupling is based on the weak coupling assumption , where the raising and lowering rates are much smaller than the internal electronic levels of the ion . in complete analogy to the classical otto cycle , no heat is thus being exchanged during the unitary strokes @xmath2 and @xmath10 , while no work is done during the iso - parametric processes @xmath6 and from @xmath47 of the cycle ( see below for a more detailed explanation ) .",
    "the evaluation of quantum work fluctuations @xcite requires nonselective , projective energy measurements on the _ total _ combined system composed of the system , the baths and the mutual system - bath interactions @xcite .",
    "the determination of work in a stroke operation thus mandates ( nonselective ) energy measurements to be applied before and after each stroke of the otto cycle .",
    "typically this presents a formidable challenge , both for theory and even more so for experiments .",
    "this difficult task persists _ even _ in the case in which the coupling among the baths and the system of interest is weak @xcite .",
    "namely , with all energetic contributions of the system - bath interactions being neglected , the work fluctuations for the system are still composed of both the changes in the internal energy of the system and , in general , finite energy exchanges with the baths",
    ".    both these contributions are typically non - vanishing .",
    "however , the difficult task becomes feasible if for instance , the average heat exchange is vanishing , yielding an average work exchange @xmath48 that is equal to the change of the energy of the system @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "likewise , when the work on the total system is vanishing , it implies that the change of the energy of the system alone is determined solely by the typically quite intricate heat exchange @xmath51 among the baths and the system , i.e. @xmath52 . in this case the projective measurement of the ( nonselective ) bare system energy alone is sufficient @xcite .",
    "it thus demands that the quantum state given by the corresponding reduced density operator must be calculated .",
    "this in turn allows the overall average exchanges of either work or heat to be evaluated .",
    "+ we next introduce a nonselective energy postmeasurement following each stroke of the cycle .",
    "this can be formalized by writing down the corresponding ( postmeasurement ) density operators explicitly .",
    "the average energies are obtained in terms of projective energy measurements of the corresponding quantum state of the otto engine . by introducing the projection operator @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the instantaneous @xmath55-th energy eigenstate of the corresponding time - frozen system hamiltonian at time @xmath56 , the effect of the postmeasurement on the state at time @xmath56",
    "is then given by a nonselective quantum state , and the reduced density operator @xmath57 that reads @xmath58 since we are primarily interested in studying time - asymmetric protocols , we consider cycles in which a total time span @xmath27 is spent on the unitary strokes and a total time @xmath28 on the dissipative strokes .",
    "we further parametrize the distribution of the time intervals within the unitary and dissipative strokes to allow for asymmetry in the driving protocol .",
    "for instance the time spent on the compression stroke @xmath2 , is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a real number between @xmath61 and @xmath62 , while the time spent on the expansion stroke , @xmath10 , is given by @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , for the dissipative strokes , coupling to the hot bath @xmath6 is performed in time @xmath64 and to the cold bath @xmath47 , in time @xmath65 .",
    "for the unitary strokes of the cycle , we consider a protocol in which @xmath4 varies linearly between @xmath66 and @xmath67 , such that @xmath68 for the compression stroke and @xmath69 $ ] for the expansion stroke . here",
    "we have used @xmath16 and @xmath70 respectively for the times at which the system is at stages @xmath62 and @xmath71 of the cycle . a plot of the time dependence of @xmath4 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) ( continuous blue line ) .    on the dissipative end of things , the coupling to the hot bath is turned on instantaneously at time @xmath72 from zero to the values @xmath73 and back to zero at time @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , on the cold end , the bath couplings are again instantaneously switched from zero to @xmath74 for the time between @xmath75 and @xmath24 .",
    "a depiction of the change of @xmath18 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) , where the green - dashed line represents @xmath20 and the dot - dashed red line depicts @xmath19 . note that @xmath76 and that their ratio is different in the two dissipative strokes , indicating that the system is driven towards different gibbs - like states .    in the following we use the notation @xmath77 for the map corresponding to the stroke from @xmath78 to @xmath7 acting on the state @xmath79",
    "explicitly , considering a postmeasurement density operator @xmath80 for the system , just after an energy measurement , the various strokes are given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 with @xmath83 and @xmath84 denotes time ordering .",
    "it then follows that @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a non - unitary map that evolves a density operator @xmath30 from @xmath87 to @xmath88 using the dissipative lindblad master equation ( [ eq : master]-[eq : dissipator ] ) with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , where the parameters are time independent .",
    "the cycle closes upon applying the last two strokes ; i.e. , @xmath91 and back to the initial steady state , a fixed point of the cycle composed of four strokes , i.e. , @xmath92    the steady state of the map is thus used to characterize the cycle given by the combination of the four strokes , which in our case is unique , and is equivalent to the diagonal fixed point , obeying @xmath93    because the compression and expansion strokes are unitary the system is isolated from the baths ; i.e. , no heat can be exchanged . in presence of vanishing heat",
    "the mean work output determines the average work via the sole difference of average energies of the system .",
    "this implies that the average work for the compression and expansion strokes are defined by the average of the two projectively measured energies of the isolated system @xcite ; i.e. , @xmath94 where the average energies are @xmath95 clearly the average energy can also be computed using the post measurement density operator giving @xmath96 .    keeping in mind that the baths are weakly coupled to the system",
    ", heat exchange with any bath is solely given by the negative of the corresponding bath energy changes .",
    "moreover , during the strokes @xmath97 and @xmath12 the system hamiltonian does not change ; put differently , _ no _ work is applied on the _ total _ system composed of system and baths including the weak mutual interactions ( energy conservation ) .",
    "therefore , the average work applied to the system with the control parameter for @xmath98 held constant is vanishing as well @xcite .",
    "the balance of energies exchanged thus implies that average heat exchange follows from a corresponding change in bare system energy alone , assuming here that the system hamiltonian is not dressed by its interaction with the environment @xcite .",
    "the average system energies are evaluated from the corresponding quantum state reached at the corresponding times @xmath99 .",
    "these mean values follow from the set of projective measurements of the system hamiltonian by use of the corresponding reduced density operator for the system at time @xmath100 .",
    "accordingly , we hence find that the average values of heat exchanged are determined by @xmath101 the net work of the cycle is thus given by @xmath102    the efficiency of this cycle can be appropriately defined as the ratio involving the net average work output @xmath103 divided by the net heat transferred from the hot bath into the system , @xmath104 .",
    "note that here we adopt a negative sign convention for the net work , because we are primarily interested in a thermodynamic engine which does work on a load .",

    "inverse temperatures of the bath are held at @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively for the compression and for the expansion processes . ]",
    "we next search for the optimal distribution of the total time spent on the unitary processes @xmath27 between the two strokes , which is parametrized by @xmath60 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath129 the stroke from @xmath2 constitutes an abrupt quench while a total of time @xmath27 is spent in the stroke @xmath10 . for larger values of @xmath60 the time spent in the stroke from @xmath2 increases while the one from @xmath10 decreases until @xmath130 , i.e. , when this last stroke becomes an abrupt quench .",
    "the ratio @xmath60 for which the net work is optimum is referred to as @xmath116 and we denote the maximum work as @xmath121 , given by @xmath131 ( we remind the reader that the net work for an engine is negative ) .",
    "we depict with fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) the value of @xmath116 as a function of the total time spent on the unitary strokes @xmath27 .",
    "we observe that at some critical values of @xmath27 , discontinuities in the ratio @xmath116 occur . at the occurrence of these jumps , also the derivative of the net work output changes abruptly , see fig .",

    "a similar result emerges when @xmath60 is chosen so as to maximize the efficiency , denoted here as @xmath113 , see fig .",

    "[ fig:2](b ) we observe that the abrupt jumps are also present in the values of @xmath113 , although they occur at different values of @xmath27 from the jumps in @xmath133 .",
    "moreover , in certain regions of @xmath27 an abrupt jump of @xmath116 can occur while a continuous variation of @xmath113 occurs , as is the case for @xmath134 , see the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c , d ) . hence , given a total time @xmath27 for the unitary strokes , the optimal distribution of times between the strokes @xmath135 , e.g. @xmath136 , and @xmath10 , e.g. @xmath11 , depends on the quantity being optimized for ; for instance either the net output work or the efficiency .",
    "also note that values of our numerically evaluated optimal efficiency are always below that of the carnot bound @xmath137 as they should be .",
    "the nonlinear behavior in the optimal ratio @xmath116 and @xmath113 can be understood by analyzing the work output from a single compression @xmath138 , or expansion process @xmath139 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( see also @xcite ) , the work transferred in a single unitary stroke becomes a non monotonic function of the ratio @xmath60 when the value of @xmath27 becomes sufficiently large .",

    "in fact , finding the optimal time spans between the strokes stems from matching the optimal work output from two non - monotonic functions of time under the constraint of a given total time spent on the two unitary strokes . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we observe that the number of oscillations present in the work output as a function of @xmath60 increases with the duration of total time spent on the two unitaries @xmath27    in fig .

    "in the previous section , the state at the beginning of the compression and expansion strokes , @xmath62 and @xmath71 respectively , were assumed to be effectively thermal - like ( because enough operation time was spent on the two dissipative strokes @xmath6 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "we now consider the case in which the time spans of the dissipative strokes , @xmath9 and @xmath14 , are too short for thermalization to occur such that the quantum states in @xmath62 and @xmath71 are no longer thermal - like . under such circumstances , as detailed with eq .",

    "in particular , we would like to stress that the numerical evolution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) in the strokes @xmath6 and @xmath47 is particularly simple because after the measurements in @xmath155 and @xmath156 the density operator is diagonal in the instantaneous eigenbasis of @xmath157",

    "this implies that the density operator , in the strokes @xmath97 and @xmath47 commutes with the hamiltonian and hence its evolution only depends on the part involving the dissipation .    in order to stay in the weak coupling regime throughout the evolution",

    "however , given the stylized setup of our system , keeping the products @xmath160 and @xmath161 fixed while varying @xmath162 , @xmath144 and @xmath28 individually , results in the same @xmath163 obtained and hence leads to the same net work output and efficiency for the cycle @xcite .    in fig .",

    "we choose @xmath169 because this is a long enough time to obtain two extrema in the cycle work output when the total time is distributed across the strokes ( there would be only one maximum for shorter timescales ) .",

    "we would like to note that the engine cycle considered includes energy measurements at the end of each stroke . because in quantum mechanics each measurement affects the system via a back action , and since energy measurements are necessary to obtain the net energy balance for work output and heat exchange , it is essential to detail these measurements after each individual stroke of the cycle .",
