    "particles properties like mass , dispersion relation , lifetime and width , are expected to be modified under extreme conditions such as high temperature and density .",
    "these conditions can be encountered in the nucleus of some stars or fabricated in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions . in this fascinating context",
    "one is motivated to deal with a model that is simpler to work with than qcd and that contains the same symmetry structure of qcd . in this set of models ,",
    "we choose the njl model @xcite in one of its renormalizable extensions @xcite to investigate the neutral pion decay in a hot and dense medium .",
    "one of the most important contributions to the production of low - energy photons in an ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision comes from the electromagnetic decay of the neutral pion . to be more precise , photons from @xmath0 and @xmath2 decays",
    "are responsible for almost @xmath3 of the inclusive photon spectrum @xcite . then , given the importance of such a phenomena , one is motivated to study the modifications experienced by the neutral pions in a hot and dense medium .",
    "the @xmath4 decay at finite temperature has been studied before by various authors , but we focus here only on the results of refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite which are closely related with ours .",
    "et al _ @xcite found that for a finite pion mass at the critical temperature @xcite , there is an enhancement of the neutral pion decay . on the other hand , bi pin - zhen and rafelski @xcite considered a vanishing pion mass at the critical point , which implies in a suppression of neutral pion width near this temperature",
    "we show that , depending only on the solution taken for the vacuum spectation value of the sigma field , we reproduce those results of refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also extend our investigation to finite densities , not considered in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that from the canonical form of the njl model one gets with both the @xmath5 @xcite and mean - field approximations @xcite an effective renormalizable theory which is like the lsm ( linear sigma model ) @xcite .",
    "the reader which is unfamiliar with the lsm see , e.g. refs .",
    "the bosonic part of this effective theory is written as @xmath6   - \\frac{\\lambda}{4}(\\sigma'^2 + \\vec\\pi^2 - f_\\pi^2 ) ^2   + \\cdots \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the sigma and pion fields , respectively , @xmath9 is a positive dimensionless coupling constant and @xmath10 is the pion decay constant in vacuum .",
    "the lagrangian density above is symmetric and invariant under an @xmath11 chiral group .",
    "the vector and axial vector currents associated with this model are given respectively by @xmath12 which are conserved .",
    "if the up and down quark masses were zero , qcd would have a chiral @xmath11 symmetry . in the vacuum",
    "this symmetry is spontaneously broken with the appearance of the goldstone bosons . in reality",
    "the quark masses are very small but nonzero , so that chiral symmetry is only approximate and the pion has a small mass .",
    "an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term is added to the lagrangian which generates the realistic finite pion mass so that    @xmath13    with    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is small and positive .",
    "the axial vector current is now only `` approximately conserved '' , @xmath16 .",
    "the minimum of the classical potential in the symmetry broken theory is found to be    @xmath17",
    "from the renormalized version of the njl model @xcite , one can express the neutral pion width at zero temperature and density as    @xmath18    where we consider @xmath19 as the formfactor associated with the neutral pion decay into two on - shell photons . in the chiral limit ,",
    "one arrives at the cutoff independent result    @xmath20    it is well known that this formula is a result of a relation between the pcac ( partial conservation of axial - vector current ) and an anomaly @xcite .",
    "since it has been proved that the anomaly does not depend on temperature @xcite , the thermal effects should be taken into account through @xmath10 .",
    "we extend this also for finite densities . from eq .",
    "( [ sol1 ] ) we get up to first order in @xmath15 ,    @xmath21    from ( [ sol2 ] ) we see that @xmath7 has a non - zero vacuum expectation value .",
    "it is convenient to redefine the sigma field as @xmath22 such that @xmath23 has zero expectation value . from the shifted lagrangian the pion mass read    @xmath24    where @xmath25 . with the experimental value of the pion decay constant @xmath10",
    ", @xmath15 has to be adjusted to reproduce the neutral pion mass at zero temperature . in the equation above we have made use of eq .",
    "( [ sol2 ] ) .    then we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) as @xmath26 where @xmath27 . in ( [ width2 ] )",
    "we have used @xmath28 given by eq .",
    "( [ massp ] ) .",
    "thus , in order to know the behavior of the pion properties in extreme conditions such as high temperatures or densities , it is crucial the knowledge of @xmath10 as function of these variables @xcite .      for simplicity , we parametrized @xmath29 and @xmath30 obtained from the njl model @xcite , which are given by    @xmath31    @xmath32    with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the nuclear matter density .",
    "the constants of the expressions above are adjusted such that @xmath35 leading to @xmath36 ,    @xmath37    for the neutral pion lifetime we define @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "we note that all meson properties of interest for us in this work are expressed merely as a function of @xmath10 , in which the properties of the vacuum are encoded . the results for @xmath10 and for the pion mass ,",
    "width and lifetime as a function of temperature and density for _ case i _ are shown in the figures ( [ 1 ] ) to ( [ 8 ] ) below .",
    "we observe that the pion mass remains almost constant as the chiral transition point is approached and increases after this point , both as a function of temperature and density .",
    "this is usually referred as decoupling of the pion from matter @xcite .",
    "the neutral pion width is also approximately constant until the phase transition temperature ( density ) , where it grows up , whereas its lifetime tends to zero around this same temperature .",

    "now we turn to the case considered in ref .",
    "@xcite where the pion mass vanishes at the phase transition temperature . to avoid a divergent @xmath0 width near this critical temperature , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite allowed for the coefficient of the symmetry breaking term @xmath15 to be temperature dependent such that , near @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( where @xmath46 is the critical temperature ) in order to have a melting of the neutral pion decay width near @xmath46 .",
    "the basic argumentation of the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to impose the vanishing of @xmath48 at @xmath46 is that if the gell - mann - oakes - renner @xcite relation is valid at finite temperature , then it would dictate this behavior for @xmath48 .",

    "@xcite has that features only around @xmath46 and under certain conditions .",
    "we now discuss how to obtain the same results of ref .",
    "@xcite without the problems and limitations they found in the derivation of @xmath49 .",
    "if we go back to the second equation of ( [ sol1 ] ) , we find up to second order in @xmath15    @xmath50    inserting @xmath51 from this equation in the equations for @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( keeping up to second order in @xmath15 ) extracted form the shifted lagrangian ,    @xmath54    we find the values of @xmath15 and @xmath9 that give the experimental value of the pion and sigma masses at zero temperature and density .",

    "we have studied the behavior of some static properties ( mass , width and lifetime ) of the neutral pion under extreme conditions like high temperature and density in the framework of a renormalized version ( extension ) of the njl model which is basically the lsm .",
    "we provided simple expressions for this analysis based on the fact that @xmath10 take into account the modifications imposed by the medium .",
    "we have found that depending on the solution chosen for the vacuum expectation value of the sigma field ( i.e. , depending on the investigated scenario ) , we reproduce those results of refs .",
    "@xcite ( finite pion mass at the critical point ) and @xcite ( vanishing pion mass at the critical point ) .",
    "as the true vacuum is only one , the final word on this subject belongs to the experiment .",
    "thus , in order to get a conclusive answer for this question , it is crucial to observe and analyze the hadron and photon spectra near the critical temperature in a heavy - ion collision experiment",
    ".    we note that if _ case ii _ ( vanishing pion mass at the critical point ) is correct , then there would be no alteration in the @xmath40 decay rate in hot or dense matter near @xmath62 .",
    "this is because the hot hadronic matter lifetime is @xmath63 which is much less than the ( rest ) neutral pions lifetime that are @xmath64 . in this case",
    "the neutral pions would mostly decay in the final state ( i.e. , after freeze - out ) .    in the other scenario ( _ case i _",
    ") , where the neutral pion decay is enhanced near the critical temperature , some of the pions that are located in regions of the hadronic matter near to @xmath62 would decay inside the plasma and their width would be affected by it .",
    "such an increase might be detected in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is worth to point out here that the present photon momentum resolution of the star experiment  @xcite does not allow any decisive conclusions about the possible enhancement of the @xmath0 width spectra via the @xmath40 decay by the phenix experiment . ] .",
    "a natural extension of this work would be the verification of the ideas presented here in other processes where the decay rates also depend only on @xmath65 and the masses involved ( such as in  @xcite ) , with these quantities expressed as a function of temperature and density derived accordingly within the model under consideration .",
