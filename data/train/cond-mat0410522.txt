    "1 , it was reported that with hole - doping the long - range ordering is destroyed above @xmath8=1.3 and a spin - glass behavior appears in the @xmath8=1.5 sample .",
    "@xcite here , we consider how the spin - glass phase is caused .",
    "as described above , the magnetic interactions do not show frustration in the @xmath8=1 sample and probably in the @xmath8=1.5 sample .",
    "in addition , the magnetic correlations in the spin - glass phase is commensurate and the same as that in the undoped ca@xmath4y@xmath4cu@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to understand how the spin - glass phase appears in the absence of frustrating interactions . it may be possible that doped holes are not localized randomly but partially ordered @xcite and as the results short - ranged magnetic clusters , which give rise to a cluster spin - glass behavior , are formed although the ordering is not long - ranged",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the correlation length along the chain is larger than the average spin cluster size as described in sec .",
    "it is interesting that the spin - glass behavior appears in a very narrow region @xmath381.5 .",
    "this is probably because finite interchain couplings are needed to form finite - sized spin clusters which can realize the cluster - spin - glass behavior .",
    "it is theoretically predicted that in two - dimensional ising system with mobile defects finite sized clusters are formed .",
    "@xcite with more hole - doping the magnetic correlations along the chain change from being ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic  @xcite and a dimerized state finally appears .",
    "@xcite there might be a drastic change in magnetic interactions above @xmath8=1.7 probably driven by a charge ordering as in the sr@xmath12cu@xmath13o@xmath14 system .",
    "@xcite    it is interesting to compare the results in ca@xmath0y@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 with those in related system la@xmath2ca@xmath81cu@xmath13o@xmath14 that also consists of edge - sharing cuo@xmath4 chains .",
    "la@xmath2ca@xmath81cu@xmath13o@xmath14 shows antiferromagnetic ordering below 10.5 k.  @xcite in this compound , the characteristic features are that the magnetic interactions are frustrating and that broadening of the excitation peak is much more enhanced than in ca@xmath0y@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite the latter originates from the combined effects of frustrating interactions @xcite and disorder introduced by a small amount of holes ( @xmath3910% ) and by a slight structural distortion in la@xmath2ca@xmath81cu@xmath13o@xmath14 .    in summary",
    ", a systematic study of temperature and hole concentration dependencies of the magnetic excitations in ca@xmath0y@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 shows that the magnetic excitations are softened and broadened with increasing temperature or doping holes .",
    "it was also suggested that the intrachain interaction does not change so much with increasing temperature or doping although the anisotropic interaction and the interchain interaction are reduced . in the spin - glass phase ( @xmath8=1.5 ) and nearly disordered phase ( @xmath8=1.67 )",
    "the magnetic excitations are much broadened in energy and @xmath7 .",
    "neither antiferromagnetic correlations nor singlet dimers caused by a charge ordering coexist with the spin - glass or the nearly disordered phase although there is a possibility of a partial charge ordering , which gives rise to the spin - glass behavior .",
