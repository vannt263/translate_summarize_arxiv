    "cosmic strings are topologically stable one - dimensional objects which are predicted by grand unified theories .",
    "cosmic strings ( as well as other topological defects ) may appear during a phase transition in the early universe .",
    "( a detailed discussion of cosmic strings and other topological defects can be found in shellard and vilenkin @xcite . )",
    "the characteristic thickness of a cosmic string is @xmath5 while its mass per unit length is @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the characteristic mass defining the symmetry breaking in the grand unified theory which is responsible for the cosmic string formation , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the planck mass and length , respectively .    for cosmic strings of astrophysical interest",
    "the parameter @xmath10 is much less than any other parameters that enter the problem , such as the length of the string or the size of inhomogeneity of the gravitational field in which it is moving , so that one can idealize the motion of the string as a two - dimensional worldsheet @xmath11 .",
    "it can be shown that the equations of motion of a cosmic string in this approximation follow from the nambu - goto action ( see e.g. , shellard and vilenkin @xcite ) , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the spacetime metric , @xmath14 denote the worldsheet coordinates ( @xmath15 ; @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , and @xmath18 is the induced metric on the worldsheet of the string . a two - dimensional worldsheet which provides an extremum to the nambu - goto action is a minimal surface .",
    "we consider the interaction of a cosmic string with a black hole of mass @xmath19 .",
    "for this problem the gravitational field created by the string can be neglected because the dimensionless parameter which characterizes the strength of the field @xmath20 is negligibly small ( for gut one has @xmath21 ) .",
    "it means that we can consider the string as a test object moving in the background of a black hole metric .",
    "we also assume that the length of the string @xmath22 is much greater than the gravitational radius , @xmath23 , and use the infinite - string approximation .",
    "there are two possible outcomes for a cosmic string moving from infinity towards a black hole : it may pass near the black hole and escape to the distant region ( gravitational scattering ) , or it may be captured by the black hole .",
    "the scattering of a string is an inelastic process since the string absorbs some energy ( i.e. the string s internal energy , connected with the excitations of its degrees of freedom , changes during the interaction ) .",
    "the capture of a cosmic string occurs when the string passes sufficiently close to the gravitational radius .",
    "after capture , the string remains attached to the black hole . for @xmath24 the total mass of the string is much smaller than the mass of the black hole , and the attached string will move around the black hole while the black hole remains practically at rest . in the opposite case , @xmath25 , the black hole will be accelerated by the string .",
    "the characteristic time of this process is @xmath26 .",
    "our aim is to study the gravitational interaction of a cosmic string with a schwarzschild black hole and to determine the conditions under which the string is captured . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider an infinitely long string which is initially straight ( far from the black hole ) , and denote its initial velocity by @xmath0 and its impact parameter by @xmath27 ( see figure  1 ) . for a given velocity @xmath0 ,",
    "capture occurs if @xmath27 is less than the so - called capture impact parameter @xmath28 . by solving the equations of motion of the string",
    "numerically we obtain the dependence of the capture impact parameter on the initial velocity @xmath0 .",
    "in order to use numerical methods it is convenient to deal with a string of finite size . for this purpose",
    "we modify the problem by taking a finite string and attaching heavy particles ( `` monopoles '' ) at its ends ( see figure  1 ) . in this case",
    ", it is easier to use a quadratic form of the string action , equivalent to the nambu - goto action , namely the polyakov action @xcite .",
    "the corresponding action takes the form , @xmath29 & =   & -\\mu \\int_{{\\tau}_{1}}^{{\\tau}_{2 } } { d\\tau \\int_{{\\sigma}_{1}(\\tau)}^{{\\sigma}_{2}(\\tau ) } { d\\sigma\\,\\sqrt{-h } \\,h^{ab}\\,g_{ab}}}\\\\ \\nonumber & - & \\sum_{i=1}^{2}{{{m}_{i } \\over 2}\\int_{{\\tau}_{1}}^{{\\tau}_{2 } } { d\\tau\\,\\,{g}_{\\mu \\nu}\\ , { d x_i^{\\mu}(\\tau ) \\over d\\tau}\\ ,   { d x_i^{\\nu}(\\tau ) \\over d\\tau}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the internal metric with determinant @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is a world - line of the @xmath33-particle , and @xmath34 is its mass .",
    "the end points are taken to represent the mass of a longer ( potentially infinite ) string lying outside the region of interest ; the motion of these points represents a boundary condition for the section of the string worldsheet under study .",
    "this approach allows us to approximate the motion of an infinite string by considering the case of extremely heavy particles , when @xmath35 . under this assumption",
    ", the variation of the action of the massive end points with respect to @xmath36 leads to the equations of motion , @xmath37    the equations of motion of a string are obtained by varying the action ( [ 2 ] ) with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "we fix the freedom in the choice of internal coordinates @xmath39 on the worldsheet of the string by using a conformal gauge so that @xmath30 is of the form @xmath40 .",
    "the remaining freedom is used to put @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the end points . in these",
    "coordinates the equations of motion of the string have the form @xmath43 the last two equations are constraints .",
    "we use them as checks on the quality of the numerical solutions to ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the equations of motion of the string and the end points need to be solved simultaneously . in order to do this ,",
    "it is necessary to relate the proper time of the string ( @xmath44 ) and the parameter ( @xmath44 ) appearing in ( [ 3a ] ) .",
    "this is done in the process of performing variation of the action for the finite length of string , which yields conditions on the boundaries of the string worldsheet .",
    "the details of these calculations are not important , but it follows from matching the behaviour of the boundaries of the string worldsheet and the massive particles that these two time - like parameters must be the same , namely the proper time .",
    "so , together with the equations of motion for the string ( [ 3 ] ) , the condition that the end points of the string move along geodesics , @xmath45 gives the boundary conditions for the string equations .",
    "we assume that the ends of the string are moving on initially parallel geodesics with velocity @xmath0 .",
    "numerical results demonstrate that as soon as the length @xmath22 of the string becomes greater than some quantity @xmath46 the capture parameter @xmath28 does not depend on @xmath22 . in other words ,",
    "in this regime the massive end points do not alter the dynamics of the string itself .",
    "their role becomes one of simulating the behaviour of an infinite string .",
    "more will be said on this in the following sections .",
    "the equations of motion of the cosmic string have the form of a system of non - linear wave equations . after some trials with more traditional approaches , a method based on von neumann s discretization for the linear wave equation was developed .",
    "this approach deals with the wave equation directly as a second - order equation , with a standard finite differencing for the time derivative and an averaging method for the spatial derivative that gives rise to an implicit scheme .",
    "von neumann s discretization yields a tridiagonal system that is solved algebraically . the extended version of the method deals with a block - tridiagonal system of linearized equations that is solved iteratively .",
    "details on the numerical method can be found in @xcite .    in order to have a well - posed problem",
    ", we must specify the shape of the string at some initial time @xmath47 , along with normal derivatives ( @xmath48 ) everywhere on the string , including the massive ends , at this initial time .",
    "taken together , these completely specify the initial / boundary value problem ( ibvp ) . since the von neumann method requires two time steps in order to compute the next ( unknown ) time step , a completely equivalent way of specifying the ibvp is to use two initial time steps . using the property of asymptotic flatness for the schwarzschild spacetime , and the fact that analytic solutions to the equations of motion in minkowski spacetime are readily obtained",
    ", the ibvp can be specified using analytic expressions .",
    "although this approach requires that the solution be started well away from the black hole , it greatly simplifies the process of starting the von neumann solver .",
    "although a cosmic string can not be straight when exposed to an inverse - square force , the choice of the initial position of the string is made so as to minimize the discrepancy between the analytic ( straight ) solution and `` true '' solution in the black hole spacetime ; the constraint equations are a useful guide in this choice .",
    "the initial position must also be sufficiently distant so that the capture impact parameter is not affected ( starting a straight string solution too close to the black hole could have a marked effect on the capture impact parameter ) .",
    "the portion of the cosmic string that passes closest to the black hole will experience a larger gravitational force than more distant parts of the string . because of this",
    ", the string will become deformed as it moves through the spacetime of the black hole . for more distant parts of the string , where the gravitational field is weak , it is possible to describe this deformation by solving the linearized nambu - goto equations . in this approximation",
    "the deformation can be treated as a perturbation to a straight string solution and decomposed into two components : ( 1 ) a component that is directed along the original direction of motion , and ( 2 ) a component that is orthogonal to ( 1 ) and to the straight string itself .",
    "this analysis shows that , due to the long - range nature of the gravitational field , the deformation in the direction of motion ( 1 ) can be large .",
    "what is important is that the deformation along ( 2 ) remains finite ; this deformation is related to the process of string capture .",
    "the deformation of the central part of the sting determines whether or not capture will occur , and a numerical solution to the equations of motion is required to make this determination .",
    "because the string has tension , which acts to straighten its bent parts , it is reasonable to expect that it would be more difficult to capture the string than a test particle moving with the same velocity and impact parameter . in other words ,",
    "the capture impact parameter for a string approaching a black hole should be less than the capture impact parameter for a test particle .    the results of the numerical calculations are presented in figure  2 .",
    "it shows log  log graphs of the capture impact parameter ( @xmath49 ) as a function of initial velocity .",
    "dashed , dotted , and dashed - dotted lines represent capture impact parameters for strings of lengths @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the capture curves for the cosmic strings are shown with error bars .",
    "the lower bound indicates largest impact parameter resulting in capture , while the upper bound indicates the smallest impact parameter for which the string escaped .",
    "the data for these curves was obtained using eddington - finkelstein ingoing coordinates since it is easy to determine when the string becomes trapped ( capture occurs when the radial coordinate in the equatorial plane is less than the gravitational radius ) .",
    "the graphs show that for a string of finite size the capture impact parameter depends on both the length and velocity of the string , @xmath53 .",
    "the capture curve for the @xmath54 string is definitive for velocities @xmath55 , meaning that the capture curves for longer strings are indistinguishable in this velocity range .",
    "probing the low - velocity behaviour of very long strings is numerically intensive , so the extension of the capture curves below @xmath56 has yet to be carried out .",
    "the solid line represents the capture impact parameter for a test particle .",
    "the gravitational capture of test particles is well understood : a particle moving at non - relativistic velocities has a capture impact parameter @xmath57 , while in the ultra - relativistic regime ( @xmath58 ) , the capture impact parameter is @xmath59 .",
    "the capture impact parameter for the ultra - relativistic particle is also the smallest capture impact parameter .",
    "the capture curve of a cosmic string is different in many ways from that of a test particle . unlike a test particle ,",
    "the smallest capture impact parameter for a string occurs at some intermediate velocity ( e.g @xmath60 for the @xmath61 string ) .",
    "the capture impact parameter increases as @xmath58 and @xmath62 .",
    "also , the smallest capture impact parameter decreases with increasing string length . at a sufficiently low velocity , the capture curve of a ( finite ) string intersects the curve for the test particle .",
    "the capture impact parameter for strings is independent of string length for velocities approaching @xmath63 , even for very short strings .",
    "the increase in the capture impact parameter for velocities approaching the speed of light can be understood in terms of the propagation time of influences along the string . as @xmath58 , the interaction time where the string experiences the gravitational pull of the black hole becomes progressively shorter , and",
    "the influence of the black hole is felt by a shorter and shorter segment of string .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that in the ultimate limit , the string will behave like a particle and hence have the same capture impact parameter .",
    "this result illustrates how the internal tension in the string helps determine its response to the gravitational field of the black hole . in the extreme relativistic limit",
    ", tension plays no role since signals can not propagate sufficiently far down the string to help influence the capture process . at lower velocities",
    ", tension plays an increasingly dominant role and helps the string avoid capture .",
    "the smallest capture impact parameter for the string is far less than that for a test particle , and occurs away from the ultra - relativistic limit .",
    "the capture curve for @xmath64 intersects the capture curve for the test particle .",
    "this reflects the fact that for small velocities the finiteness of the string plays an important role .",
    "the trajectories of the massive particles terminating the strings are focused by the black hole .",
    "when the strings are sufficiently long , this focusing is negligible .",
    "however , the boundary conditions used in the numerical work force these massive particles to move on geodesics , so they are subject to the same capture characteristics as free test particles .",
    "this means that the end particles will be trapped by the black hole when the initial velocity becomes sufficiently small , no matter how far they are initially from the black hole .",
    "since there is a string connecting the two particles , its behaviour will be greatly influenced by a strong focusing of the end points , and hence easily captured .",
    "for this reason , the intersection of particle and string curves is to be expected for any finite length of string .",
    "however , the initial velocity for which intersection occurs decreases with increasing string length . in the ultimate limit , where string length becomes infinite , the two curves should intersect only when @xmath65 .    when @xmath62 , the string is expected to exhibit the characteristics of a stationary string , provided that the characteristic time for propagation of signals along the string , @xmath66 , is much less than the characteristic time for passage by the black hole @xmath67 , or by rearranging , the string is effectively static provided that @xmath68 .",
    "stationary string solutions have been discussed by frolov _",
    "et al _ @xcite . using their results ,",
    "it is easy to show that the minimum radial coordinate of a stationary string of length l whose end points are located at @xmath69 is given by , @xmath70\\ ] ] provided @xmath71 the string avoids capture .",
    "however , it is easily seen that @xmath72 as @xmath73 , so that stationary strings of infinite length are always captured .",
    "this confirms the claim made above .",
    "in this numerical study of the gravitational capture of cosmic strings , we modelled strings of infinite length using finite strings with special ( geodesic ) boundary conditions .",
    "these boundary conditions proved problematic at low velocities if the string length is made too short , since the trajectory of the massive end points can be greatly influenced by the black hole under these conditions ( the focusing problem ) .",
    "however , the capture curve is independent of string length for velocities close to that of light .",
    "further , a string of infinite length is always harder to capture than a test particle _ except _ at the two extremes , @xmath62 and @xmath58 , where the two capture curves converge .      :",
