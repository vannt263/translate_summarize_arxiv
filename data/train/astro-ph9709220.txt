    "four years ago the macho ( alcock et al.1993 ) and eros ( aubourg et al.1993 ) collaborations announced candidate gravitational microlensing events toward the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) demonstrating the viability of a new and potentially powerful probe of dark matter in the galactic halo . microlensing experiments ( paczyski 1986 ; griest 1991 ) are sensitive to any object that is smaller than its einstein radius ( in the halo , these objects are known as machos for massive compact halo objects ) and therefore complement direct observations , which survey the visible content of the galaxy , and dynamical studies , which measure the total mass density .",
    "unfortunately , microlensing experiments are subject to a number of limitations which make interpretation of their results rather difficult .",
    "first , microlensing events are extremely rare and it is necessary to monitor @xmath2 stars in order to get just a few events per year .",
    "this has restricted present day searches to regions of the sky where there are dense concentrations of stars .",
    "indeed the only published microlensing events that can be associated with halo objects have been toward the large and small magellanic clouds ( alcock et al.1993 , 1995 , 1996 , 1997b ; aubourg et al.1993 ) .",
    "microlensing experiments , with only one or two lines of sight , tell us little about the structure of the halo and , more to the point , are sensitive to potentially large systematic errors due to our incomplete knowledge of the halo s structure .",
    "moreover , because of the small number of events , there are large statistical uncertainties .",
    "finally , present day experiments are unable to determine unambiguously the mass and velocity of a given lens . despite these limitations",
    "the macho collaboration estimates , from the two - year data set , that @xmath3 or more of the mass in the halo within @xmath4 is composed of @xmath5 objects ( alcock et al.1996 ) .",
    "if true , these results would have important implications for cosmology , galaxy formation , and star formation .    the mass density in machos is determined by comparing the observed number of events with the number predicted for a particular model of the galaxy .",
    "potential systematic errors are estimated by seeing how the predicted number of events varies for different `` reasonable '' galactic models .",
    "this strategy , however , is hindered by our limited ability to construct and analyze the full complement of acceptable models . in particular , the models used to analyze macho s results do not generally include triaxiality , velocity space anisotropy , and substructure , all of which are expected in the real distribution of machos .",
    "in this paper we propose an alternative approach to understanding gravitational microlensing experiments .",
    "microlensing experiments are conducted in a halo taken from a cosmological n - body simulation .",
    "hypothetical observers make measurements of the optical depth and event rate and compare their results with model predictions much as real observers would .",
    "we can perform a large number of microlensing experiments on a single n - body halo by simply changing the positions of the observer and lmc .",
    "since we control the accuracy and sophistication of the model , we can determine how good it has to be for statistical errors to dominate over systematic ones .",
    "our intention is not to create an n - body realization of the milky way galaxy .",
    "indeed our galaxy bears little resemblance to the milky way .",
    "moreover , the simulation assumes a cold dark matter universe which may not be appropriate if a significant fraction of the dark matter is composed of machos . however the distribution of particles in the simulated galaxy does exhibit the general characteristics ( e.g. , triaxiality , substructure ) that one expects in a realistic distribution of machos .",
    "we can therefore test how well theory agrees with observation when these features are not fully taken into account .",
    "we find that a simple triaxial model , with the axial ratios and density profile determined from the simulation , provides excellent agreement between measured and predicted optical depths . in all but a few rare experiments the discrepancies are consistent with the statistical fluctuations that one would expect had the particles been chosen at random from the model distribution function .",
    "if instead an axisymmetric spheroidal model is used , systematic errors become important . and if a spherical model is used , systematic errors dominate .",
    "microlensing experiments are also sensitive to the velocity space distribution of the machos .",
    "if the velocities assumed in the model are too high , for example , one will tend to overestimate the mass of individual machos and their density . to study this ,",
    "we measure the event rate in the simulated galaxy and compare with the expected rate assuming different models for the velocity distribution .",
    "the visible parts of galaxies display substructure such as globular clusters and dwarf galaxies .",
    "substructure is also likely to exist in the distribution of dark matter especially in hierarchical clustering models of galaxy formation .",
    "microlensing experiments are especially sensitive to substructure in the galaxy : if we are unlucky , a clump of machos will be passing between us and the lmc , biasing our estimates for the density of machos in the halo ( maoz 1994 ; wasserman & salpeter 1994 ; metcalf & silk 1996 , zhao 1996 ) .",
    "our simulated microlensing experiment shows just such an effect .",
    "even with our best - fit triaxial model , there are a few lines of sight in which the measured optical depth is significantly higher than what is predicted . a close inspection of these lines of sight",
    "reveal that substructure in the halo is often the cause of the discrepancy .    in section",
    "ii we survey the types of models previously considered for the distribution of machos .",
    "the methods used to conduct microlensing experiments in an n - body galaxy are developed in section iii .",
    "our the results are presented in section iv . in section",
    "v we describe how hypothetical terrestrial dark matter detection experiments can be performed in an n - body galaxy .",
    "section vi presents a summary of our results and some concluding thoughts .",
    "a model for machos must specify their distribution in mass , configuration space , and velocity space .",
    "the `` standard '' halo model , used as a benchmark by the macho collaboration , assumes that all of the machos have the same mass , that their velocities are isotropic and maxwellian , and that their density corresponds to that of a cored isothermal sphere ( griest 1991 ; alcock et al.1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "this implies a distribution function ( df ) of the form :    f(*x * , * v * ) = ( * x*)f(*v * )    where ( * x * ) =    and f(*v * ) =  .",
    "@xmath6 is the core radius , @xmath7 is the fraction of the halo in machos , and @xmath8 is the asymptotic circular speed of the total halo . in the standard model , @xmath9 and @xmath10 while @xmath7 and @xmath11 are left as free parameters .",
    "it is a likelihood analysis of this 2-parameter model that leads to the macho collaboration s estimates for the mass and density of machos in the galaxy .",
    "the df described above represents a highly idealized macho halo .",
    "deviations between the model and the actual distribution of machos may introduce significant systematic errors in the analysis of a microlensing experiment .",
    "one can estimate these errors by considering alternative models .",
    "several groups , for example , have considered models in which the assumption of spherical symmetry is relaxed . for the most part",
    "these groups have focused on the seemingly reasonable possibility that the halo is an axisymmetric oblate spheroid ( sackett & gould 1993 ; friemann & scoccimarro 1994 ; gates , gyuk , & turner 1995 ; alcock et al.1995 , 1996 ) . models of this type can be constructed by replacing @xmath12 in eq . by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the axial ratio ( @xmath15 for oblate spheroids ) and by multiplying @xmath16 by @xmath17 .",
    "interestingly enough , the optical depth and event rate do not change much as @xmath14 varies from @xmath18 ( e6 oblate ) to @xmath19 ( spherical ) .",
    "this is because two competing effects cancel approximately .",
    "as the model halo is made more oblate , the central density must be increased if @xmath8 is to be kept fixed .",
    "this tends to increase the optical depth . at the same time",
    "our line of sight to the lmc passes through less halo material which tends to reduce the optical depth .",
    "the results for flattened halos have lead to the conjecture that the total inferred mass of machos within @xmath4 is relatively independent of the assumed model ( gates , gyuk , & turner 1995 ; alcock et al .",
    "however there is little direct evidence to suggest that the dark galactic halo is axisymmetric and oblate .",
    "observational clues about the shape of the dark galactic halo come from models of the metal - poor stellar halo ( gilmore , wyse , & kuijken 1989 ; van der marel 1991 ) , the outer satellites and globular clusters ( hartwick 1996 ) , and hi gas near the galactic plane ( merrifield & olling 1997 ) .",
    "the results are highly model dependent and somewhat ambiguous leaving open the possibility that the galactic halo is prolate or triaxial .",
    "numerical experiments may provide the best hope for understanding the structure of dark halos .",
    "the halos found in n - body simulations of dissipationless gravitational collapse are generally triaxial with a slight preference to be prolate rather than oblate ( dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; warren et al.1992 ; see also the simulation discussed below ) .",
    "the inclusion of dissipational matter , which tends to settle into a thin disk , will change these results somewhat typically driving systems to become more oblate ( katz and gunn 1991 ; dubinski 1994 ) though still generally triaxial . and there are exceptions ( evrard , summers , and davis 1994 ) suggesting that some halos may be prolate - triaxial even when dissipational matter is included . with",
    "this in mind holder & widrow ( 1996 ) have calculated the optical depth and event rate for prolate halos . for these models the central density",
    "is lowered relative to what it would be in a spherical model .",
    "this effect dominates so that predicted optical depth is reduced by a significant amount .",
    "galactic microlensing experiments are also sensitive to the velocity space distribution of the machos . if , for example , machos are preferentially on radial orbits , than the timescale for events would be systematically longer than what would be expected assuming an isotropic velocity distribution ( evans 1996 ) .",
    "the triaxial n - body halos discussed above are supported by anisotropic velocity dispersion which can affect the event rate and event duration ( holder & widrow 1996 ; evans 1996 ) .",
    "one criticism of the models discussed above is that they do not represent true equilibrium systems : with the exception of the special case @xmath20 ( the singular isothermal sphere ) a distribution function given by eqs.(1 - 3 ) does not satisfy the time - independent collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "evans and jijina ( 1994 ) have attempted to address this concern by using the so - called power - law models for the macho df .",
    "these models are constructed from simple power - law functions of the energy and angular momentum and therefore automatically describe equilibrium systems .",
    "their main advantage is that they are simple and analytic making lensing calculations relatively easy .",
    "they do have certain drawbacks .",
    "first , while the equipotential surfaces are spheroidal , the isodensity surfaces are dimpled at the poles .",
    "second , once the disk is included , the models no longer describe self - consistent equilibrium systems .    finally , several groups have considered the implications of subgalactic clustering in the distribution of machos ( maoz 1994 ; wasserman & salpeter 1994 ; metcalf & silk 1996 ; zhao 1996 ) .",
    "in general these analyses make ad hoc assumptions about the distribution and structure of macho clusters .",
    "our halo is taken from a collisionless n - body simulation of a cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe .",
    "of course machos are , in all likelihood , baryonic suggesting that a simulation of a baryon dominated universe might be more appropriate .",
    "however once machos form they are essentially collisionless . we therefore expect that a macho halo will exhibit triaxiality , velocity space anisotropy , and substructure , much like a cdm halo .    the halo is extracted from cosmological collapse simulation run with a parallel treecode on the pittsburgh cray t3e ( dubinski 1996 ) .",
    "the halo is comprised of roughly 700,000 particles within the virial radius though there are only 260,000 particles within the radius of the lmc ( figure  [ fig - nbody ] ) .",
    "each particle has a mass @xmath21 .",
    "the experiments are conducted at two different epochs corresponding to ages of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the results are essentially the same for the two time frames and we present only those from the latter .",
    "the galaxy is prolate - triaxial and has a relatively flat rotation curve out to large radii ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we model the mass distribution of the galaxy by assuming that isodensity surfaces are ellipsoidal so that @xmath24 where @xmath25 provided we have chosen the axes to coincide with the principle axes of the galaxy .",
    "the density profile is fit to an nfw profile ( navarro , frenk , & white 1996 ) :    ( m )  =     where @xmath26 is equal to the mass inside an ellipsoidal radius @xmath27 . @xmath28 and @xmath29 determined directly from the simulation .",
    "we also use less sophisticated models , specifically , a spheroidal model ( @xmath30 ) and a spherical one .",
    "the model parameters are summarized in table 1 .",
    ".model parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath26 and @xmath31 depend sensitively on the region of the halo used in the fit .",
    "in other words , eq . does not provide a very good global model for this particular galaxy .",
    "this is especially true for the @xmath32 time frame where the halo is merging with a satellite .",
    "of course , microlensing experiments only probe the region of the halo between the observer and the target stars ( i.e. , between @xmath33 and @xmath4 ) where the density profile is close to a power law .",
    "the parameters in table 1 are chosen to fit the density profile in this region .",
    "in fact , any number of fitting formulae could be used .",
    "for example , a cored isothermal sphere ( eq . ) with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 does just as well since the observer is outside the core radius and the lmc is inside the radius where the density profile becomes steeper than @xmath37 . in figure  [ fig - rot ]",
    "we show the circular rotation speed @xmath38 for the halo , model i , and the `` best - fit '' cored isothermal sphere .    a galactic coordinate system is set up in the usual way .",
    "our hypothetical observer is at the origin , the center of the galaxy is on the @xmath39-axis a distance @xmath40 away , and the @xmath41-axis points `` north '' .",
    "the hypothetical lmc is at galactic coordinates @xmath42 a distance @xmath43 from the origin . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the hypothetical lmc , in projection as seen from the observer , is a circle of radius @xmath44 .",
    "the foreground of the lmc is a conical volume @xmath45 with base diameter @xmath46 and height @xmath43 .",
    "different realizations of the experiment are performed by varying the orientation of the halo keeping the observer , lmc , and center of the halo fixed . since our halo does not have a disk , the observer is not constrained to any particular plane .",
    "we therefore have three degrees of freedom ( the euler angles ) in choosing the orientation of the halo .",
    "equivalently , we can imagine keeping the halo fixed and considering a family of hypothetical observers positioned on the surface of a sphere a distance @xmath47 from the center of the halo .",
    "the hypothetical lmcs lie on a concentric sphere of radius @xmath48 ( figure  [ fig - nbody ] ) . for each observer",
    ", there is a circle of lmcs a distance @xmath43 away that have the correct orientation .",
    "the optical depth @xmath49 is the probability that light from a star in the lmc will be amplified by a factor @xmath50 .",
    "this requires that a macho pass within a distance @xmath51 from the line of sight where @xmath52^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath53 is the einstein radius :    r_e(z ) = 9.6510 ^ -8 ( ) ^1/2  ,    and @xmath54 is the distance to the macho . for definiteness we set @xmath55 and @xmath56 . if all of the machos have the same mass then @xmath49 is equivalent to the number of machos in a tube ( the so - called lensing tube ) whose axis is the line of sight and whose radius is @xmath53 .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath49 , given an analytic model for @xmath57 , is    & = & d^3*x*(*x * ) + & = & _ 0^l dz(z)r_e^2(z )    where @xmath58 .",
    "we also calculate @xmath59 , the standard deviation one expects for @xmath49 assuming particles are chosen at random from the model df .",
    "the relevant equations for this are derived in the appendix .",
    "we can measure @xmath49 in our n - body halo by counting the number of particles in a lensing tube whose radius is given by eq . with @xmath60 .",
    "( recall that , for fixed mass density in machos , @xmath49 is independent of @xmath61 . )",
    "of course only a very small fraction of the tubes will contain a particle .",
    "we can mimic what is done in the macho experiment by counting the number of particles in a large number @xmath62 of tubes each of which lies , more or less , in the volume @xmath45 .",
    "however , it is more efficient to use all of the particles in @xmath45 , weighting them by an appropriate geometric factor . to be precise",
    "we write the df for our n - body galaxy as the sum of @xmath63-functions :    f = m_p_i ( * x*-*x*_i ) ( * v*-*v*_i )    where @xmath64 labels the particles in the simulation . substituting into eq .",
    "we have    = _",
    "i()^2    where the sum is over all particles in @xmath45 and we use @xmath60 in calculating @xmath53 .",
    "an alternative strategy is to replace @xmath45 with a volume @xmath65 whose shape is the same as that of a lensing tube .",
    "for example , we can choose @xmath65 to be a tube of radius @xmath66 so that the maximum radius of the tube is equal to the radius of the lmc . in this case all particles contribute equally to @xmath49 making it easy to visualize the phase space distribution of objects in the tube . furthermore , near the observer , where the density of halo objects is presumably highest",
    ", @xmath65 is fatter than @xmath45 .",
    "we therefore expect more objects in the tube and hence better statistics .",
    "the main disadvantage of this strategy is that it distorts the geometry of a realistic microlensing experiment .",
    "the angular diameter of @xmath65 is @xmath67 which is far too big near the observer .",
    "we will therefore use @xmath45 to calculate the optical depth .",
    "however we use @xmath65 to calculate the event rate where it is difficult to estimate statistical uncertainties when @xmath45 is used ( see appendix and the next section ) .      in practice",
    "the expected number of events , @xmath68 , is more useful than the optical depth when comparing predictions with observations .",
    "@xmath68 is given by    n_exp = e_0^ ( ) d    where @xmath69 is the event duration , @xmath70 is the magnitude of the transverse macho velocity in the lensing tube rest frame , @xmath71 is the detection efficiency , and @xmath72 is the `` exposure '' for the experiment given in units of `` star - yr '' .",
    "the differential event rate is given by    d= dd*v*f(*x*,*v * ) v _    where @xmath73 is a surface element on the lensing tube and @xmath74 .",
    "given an analytic function for @xmath57 , the total event rate @xmath75 is found by integrating over @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "to calculate @xmath78 , the event rate as a function of event duration , we change variables from @xmath70 to @xmath79 , differentiate with respect to @xmath79 , and integrate over the remaining variables .",
    "if the velocities of the machos are isotropic and maxwellian ( eq . ) than the expectation values for @xmath75 and @xmath78 are    = _ 0^l dz(z)r_e(z )    and    = _ 0^l ( z)r_e(z)dz  .",
    "an expression for @xmath80 , the standard deviation for @xmath75 assuming particles are chosen at random from an analytic df , is derived in the appendix .",
    ". represents a flux of particles through a surface , something that is difficult to measure in an n - body simulation . to circumvent this problem",
    "we multiply both sides of eq . by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the distance from the axis of the lensing tube :",

    "@xmath78 is estimated by binning the events according to event duration .",
    "we illustrate the techniques developed above in a toy galaxy where the positions and velocities of the particles are chosen at random from a known analytic df . for definiteness",
    "we assume that this df is given by eqs.(1 - 3 ) with @xmath35 , @xmath83 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the galaxy is represented by 200,000 @xmath84 mass particles .",
    "1000 individual microlensing experiments are performed , each of which assumes a different orientation for the galaxy . to be precise ,",
    "let @xmath85 be the three euler angles which describe the galaxy s orientation .",
    "we take @xmath86 even steps in @xmath87 ( from @xmath88 to @xmath89 ) , @xmath90 ( from @xmath91 to @xmath92 ) , and @xmath93 ( from @xmath88 to @xmath89 ) .",
    "we choose @xmath94 .",
    "this is roughly a factor of two larger than the real lmc , a choice made to increase the number of particles in the experimental volume @xmath45 .    from the analytic df",

    "this accounts for the vertical stripes in figure  [ fig - spheroid]a .",
    "model ii is fairly close to the triaxial model : the axial ratios @xmath116 and @xmath29 have changed by roughly @xmath117 .",
    "nevertheless , there are noticeable systematic effects , as can be seen by comparing figures  [ fig - spheroid]b and [ fig - spheroid]c with [ fig - triax]b and [ fig - triax]c .",

    "we take @xmath126 which is found by computing the rms velocity for all of the particles in the halo .    the experiments with high event rate correspond to orientations of the galaxy which put the lmc on the long axis and the observer in the plane containing the two short axes .",
    "in these experiments , the model overestimates the event rate by as much as @xmath127 .",
    "as discussed in section 3.1 , the parameters in the nfw profile depend sensitively on the region of the galaxy used in the fit .",
    "the fits in table 1 are based on the region of the halo inside an ellipsoidal radius of @xmath128 .",
    "however , the high @xmath75 experiments probe smaller ellipsoidal radii where the model tends to overestimate the density .",
    "a similar problem might arise in actual microlensing experiments since the density profile for the galaxy is determined from observations of stars and gas near the galactic disk while the lmc lies close to the south galactic pole .",
    "the triaxial structure of our simulated galaxy is supported by anisotropic velocity dispersion .",
    "indeed the velocity dispersion in the @xmath129-direction is a factor @xmath130 higher than in the @xmath39 and @xmath41 directions , in agreement with what one expects from the tensor virial theorem for a galaxy of this shape .",

    "@xmath131 and @xmath132 are related to @xmath116 and @xmath29 through the tensor virial theorem . while this model still makes the rather dubious assumption that the distribution of machos in velocity space is independent of position it does connect the shape of the halo with its velocity space structure in a reasonable way . unfortunately calculating model predictions with eq .",
    "is quite cumbersome .",
    "we choose instead to consider a model in which the velocity distribution is assumed to be isotropic but with @xmath8 determined separately for each experiment using the particles in the `` experimental '' volume @xmath65 .",
    "the results , presented in figure  [ fig - gamm - improve ] , show a clear improvement over those in figure  [ fig - gamma - triax ] where the same @xmath8 was used for all experiments . while ad hoc , this comparison suggests that velocity anisotropy can lead to systematic errors in a microlensing experiment . to further illustrate this point we measure @xmath78 for a single experiment and compare with model predictions .",
    "this is done in figure  [ fig - dgamdt - anios ] .",
    "two models are chosen , one with @xmath8 taken from the simulation as a whole , and the other with @xmath8 measured locally ( i.e. , in the volume @xmath65 ) .",
    "clearly the latter provides better agreement between theory and experiment though the net effect on @xmath68 ( which is calculated by integrating over @xmath133 ) may be rather small .",
    "as noted above , even with the triaxial model , the number of experiments with a relatively high ( @xmath134 ) discrepancy between measured and observed optical depth is greater than expected had the particles been chosen at random from the model df .",
    "we have looked in detail at the phase space distribution of particles in these lensing tubes .",
    "( here , we use the volume @xmath65 which has the same shape as the lensing tube .",
    "this avoids the complication of having particles of different weight in the sum for @xmath49 . ) in figure  [ fig - vp - vz]a we show the distribution of particles as a function of @xmath70 and @xmath54 , the two relevant phase space coordinates for microlensing experiments . a clump of approximately @xmath135 particles ( @xmath136 ) , 2/3 of the way to the lmc and moving through the lensing tube with a velocity of @xmath137 , is clearly visible . with enough events",
    ", one might `` see '' such a clump in a plot of the event rate as a function of event duration ( figure  [ fig - vp - vz]b ) .",
    "however , the clump is not nearly so pronounced in an `` observers - eye '' view of this region of the sky ( figure  [ fig - vp - vz]c ) .",
    "substructure of this type is entirely expected in hierarchical clustering models such as cdm .",
    "the object shown in figure  [ fig - vp - vz ] is a dwarf halo that will spiral , under the influence of dynamical friction , toward the center of the main halo , eventually being stripped apart by tidal interactions .",
    "objects of this type arise in about @xmath138 of our experiments , a small but still significant fraction .",
    "of course substructure in the stellar halo of the galaxy has already been observed ( see , for example , majewski , munn , & hawley 1994 ; ibata , gilmore , & irwin 1995 ) .",
    "indeed , observations by zaritsky $ lin ( 1997 ) indicate that there may be an excess of stars between us and the lmc .",
    "though these observations are somewhat controversial ( alcock et al.1997a ) they do suggest an alternative explaination for macho s results : microlensing by foreground stars of a `` lumpy '' halo ( zaritsky & lin 1997 ; zhao 1997 ) .",
    "there are currently a large number of experiments , either in operation or in construction , designed to search for elementary particle dark matter candidates such as weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) and axions ( dougherty 1995 ; rosenberg 1995 ) . typically these experiments measure the density and kinetic energy distribution of dark matter particles passing through a terrestrial laboratory .",
    "the results of such experiments are therefore subject to systematic effects similar to the ones discussed in the previous sections . clearly , the large scale structure of the halo , such as its shape , density profile , and velocity space structure , will determine the local density and energy distribution of dark matter particles .",
    "small scale structures such as those found in our microlensing experiments can also affect the outcome of dark matter search experiments .",
    "along similar lines , sikivie , tkachev , and wang ( 1996 ) have suggested that there may be discrete peaks in the local energy distribution of dark matter particles .",
    "their analysis is based on the secondary infall model of fillmore & goldreich ( 1984 ) and bertschinger ( 1985 ) which is characterized by an intricate fine - grained structure in phase space .",
    "this model assumes spherical symmetry , radial orbits , and smooth accretion of matter and no doubt provides a highly idealized description of the galactic halo .",
    "still the work raises the interesting possibility that phase space structure can have an impact on dark matter search experiments .",
    "we can test some of these possibilities by performing dark matter search experiments in an n - body halo .",
    "we measure the kinetic energy distribution of particles in a volume @xmath139 centered on a hypothetical observer and compare the results with model predictions .",
    "let @xmath140 be the position vector of a hypothetical observer as measured from the center of the halo , @xmath141 be the density of dark matter in the region of the observer , and @xmath142 be the local velocity distribution function , i.e. , @xmath143 .",
    "the number of particles with kinetic energy per unit mass between @xmath144 and @xmath145 is    n ( ) & = & + & = & f(*v*)d d_v    where @xmath146 . as an illustrative example , we perform @xmath147 dark matter search experiments taking @xmath139 to be a sphere of radius @xmath148 . figure  [ fig - wimp]a shows the results for the total number of particles @xmath149 in the volume @xmath139 .",
    "each point in the plot displays the measurement and prediction for a different observer .",
    "the model used in making the predictions is the same triaxial model discussed above . in addition , we assume that the velocities are isotropic and maxwellian .",
    "figure  [ fig - wimp]b shows normalized energy spectra as measured by 4 different observers .",
    "the results are consistent with what one would expect from statistical fluctuations .",
    "the difficulty we face is that with only @xmath150 particles in the halo , the spatial and energy resolution is rather poor .",
    "a detailed energy spectrum would require @xmath151 while the structures we are interested in may well have a scale significantly less than a kiloparsec .",
    "unfortunately , for this simulation , the number of particles in a sphere of radius @xmath152 is @xmath153 .",
    "the dark galactic halo is , in all likelihood , a very complicated system .",
    "most theories of galaxy formation would predict that it is triaxial in shape and that the velocity distribution varies from point to point and is generally anisotropic .",
    "moreover , if the galactic halo is built up from smaller collapsed objects , as in hierarchical clustering models , it will contain substructure on a wide range of subgalactic scales .",
    "traditionally dark matter search experiments such as macho have assumed some idealized model for the dark matter df ( e.g. , eqs.(1 - 3 ) ) leading to potentially large systematic errors .",
    "these errors can be estimated by considering alternative models for the halo such as those discussed in section 2 .",
    "our goal has been to test this programme by performing microlensing experiments in an n - body realization of a cdm galaxy and comparing the results with predictions made assuming a variety of halo models .",
    "our conclusions are as follows :    * the success of a gravitational microlensing experiment depends crucially on the quality of the model chosen for the distribution function of the machos .",
    "the galaxy in our simulated experiment is highly asymmetric . by accurately modeling the shape and density profile of the galaxy we can achieve excellent agreement between measured and predicted quantities such as the optical depth and event rate . if instead , a spherical model is used , the agreement is rather poor , the typical systematic errors in the determination of @xmath49 and @xmath75 being @xmath154 .",
    "* a wide range of fitting formulae will adequately describe the density profile of the halo in the region between the observer and the lmc . in this work ,",
    "we use the nfw profile though a cored isothermal sphere , fit to the measured density profile in this region , will work just as well .",
    "an accurate global fit to the density profile is required only if one plans to use observations well outside this region .",
    "this suggests that , for actual microlensing experiments , one should use a model density profile based on observations of the galaxy between @xmath155 and @xmath4 .",
    "however most of these observations are of material in the galactic plane whereas the lmc is at high galactic latitude .",
    "systematic errors , such as those seen in figures  [ fig - gamma - triax ] and [ fig - gamm - improve ] , will arise if the halo is far from spherical and the model density profile does not provide a good global fit even if we have correctly modeled the shape of the halo .",
    "* the distribution of machos in velocity space affects the event rate and event duration both of which are used to estimate the mass and density of the machos .",
    "the triaxial shape of our n - body galaxy is supported by velocity space anisotropy . by properly taking this into account",
    "one can improve the agreement between measurements and predictions .",
    "* substructure in the distribution of machos can affect the outcome of a microlensing experiment .",
    "in particular , a clump of machos passing between us and the lmc can significantly bias the results .",
    "though this situation arises in only @xmath156 of our experiments , it can lead to errors as large as @xmath157 in estimates of the optical depth and event rate .",
    "one should not take the quantitative results in this work too literally .",
    "first , the simulation was done in the context of a standard cold dark matter universe which may not be applicable if machos are a significant fraction of the dark matter .",
    "a baryon dominated universe might be more appropriate .",
    "of course , these models tend to have more power on small scales suggesting even more halo substructure .",
    "second , our galaxy was created in a pure dissipationless simulation so that there is no gaseous or stellar disk .",
    "disk formation will affect the both shape of the halo and the density profile .",
    "for example , the presence of a disk will probably drive our prolate halo toward a more triaxial shape ( katz & gunn 1991 ; dubinski 1994 ) which might improve the performance of the spherical model .",
    "nevertheless , it is probably optimistic to think that we know the shape of the halo well enough to be able to use gaussian or poisson statistics for a microlensing experiment .",
    "finally , our simulation , with particles of mass @xmath158 , is not able to resolve all of the substructure relevant to a microlensing experiment .    despite these caveats we believe our conclusions to be at least qualitatively correct",
    ". it will be interesting to perform microlensing experiments in other simulated galaxies and in particular , simulations that include gas . in a simulated spiral galaxy , for example , one can place hypothetical observers in the disk .",
    "these observers can then `` measure '' the rotation curve of the galaxy and use this to model the density profile adding another layer of realism to the exercise . along these lines",
    ", it would be interesting to choose lines of sight in the simulation toward actual satellite galaxies to see if tidal debris of the type discussed by zhao ( 1997 ) and zaritsky & lin ( 1997 ) can indeed affect microlensing experiments .",
