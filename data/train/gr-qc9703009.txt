    "applying the well  known dirac quantization procedure to general relativity coupled to a free massive scalar field leads to the corresponding wheeler  dewitt equation and to the diffeomorphism constraints . expanding the wave functional in powers of the gravitational constant yields a semiclassical approximation @xcite@xcite , which describes the quantized matter field in a classical curved spacetime , i.e. the quantized field propagate on a classical background defined by the gravitational degrees of freedom .",
