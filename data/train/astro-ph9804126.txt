    "there are several reasons why clusters of galaxies are regarded as useful probes of cosmology including ( i ) since dynamical time - scale of clusters is comparable to the age of the universe , they should retain the cosmological initial condition fairly faithfully .",
    "( ii ) clusters can be observed in various bands including optical , x - ray , radio , mm and submm bands , and in fact recent and future big projects ( e.g. , sdss , axaf , planck ) aim to make extensive surveys and detailed imaging / spectroscopic observations of clusters .",
    "( iii ) to the first order , clusters are well approximated as a system of dark matter , gas and galaxies , and thus theoretically well - defined and relatively well - understood , at least compared with galaxies themselves , and ( iv ) on average one can observe a higher - z universe with clusters than with galaxies .",
    "in particular x - ray observations are well - suited for the study of clusters since the x - ray emissivity is proportional to @xmath2 and thus less sensitive to the projection contamination which has been known to be a serious problem in their identifications with the optical data .",
    "in fact , various statistics related to the abundances of clusters has been extensively studied to constrain theories of structure formation , including mass function ( bahcall & cen 1993 ; ueda , itoh , & suto 1993 ) , velocity function ( shimasaku 1993 ; ueda , shimasaku , suginohara , & suto 1994 ) , x - ray temperature function ( hereafter xtf , henry & arnaud 1991 ; white , efstathiou , & frenk 1993 ; kitayama & suto 1996 ; viana & liddle 1996 ; eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ; pen 1996 ) .",
    "previous authors have focused on cosmological implications of cluster xtf mainly because theoretical predictions are relatively easier although the observational data are statistically limited . in addition , the conversion to the number density at high z becomes very sensitive to the adopted cosmological parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "log@xmath0log@xmath1  which we discuss in details below is observationally more robust ( ebeling et al .",
    "1997 ; rosati & della ceca 1997 ) while its theoretical prediction is more model - dependent ( oukbir , bartlett , & blanchard 1996 ; kitayama & suto 1997 ; kitayama , sasaki & suto 1998 ) . in this respect ,",
    "both statistics are complementary .",
    "we compute the number of clusters observed per unit solid angle with x - ray flux greater than @xmath1 by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the speed of light , @xmath5 is the cosmic time , @xmath6 is the angular diameter distance , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are respectively the gas temperature and the band - limited absolute luminosity of clusters , and @xmath9 is the comoving number density of virialized clusters of mass @xmath10 at redshift @xmath11 .    given the observed flux @xmath1 in an x - ray energy band [ @xmath12,@xmath13 , the source luminosity @xmath14 at @xmath11 in the corresponding band [ @xmath15,@xmath16 is written as @xmath17 = 4 \\pi { { d_{\\scriptscriptstyle l}}}^2(z ) s[e_a , e_b ] , \\label{eq : ls}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the luminosity distance .",
    "we adopt the observed @xmath19 relation parameterized by @xmath20 we take @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 as a fiducial set of parameters on the basis of recent observational indications ( david et al .",
    "1993 ; ebeling et al . 1996",
    "; ponman et al . 1996 ; mushotzky & scharf 1997 )",
    ". then we translate @xmath24 into the band - limited luminosity @xmath25 $ ] by properly taking account of metal line emissions ( masai 1984 ) in addition to the thermal bremsstrahlung ( we fix the abundance of intracluster gas as 0.3 times the solar value ) .    assuming that the intracluster gas is isothermal , its temperature @xmath7 is related to the total mass @xmath26 by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath29 is the gravitational constant , @xmath30 is the proton mass , @xmath31 is the mean molecular weight ( we adopt @xmath32 ) , and @xmath33 is a fudge factor of order unity which may be calibrated from hydrodynamical simulations or observations .",
    "the virial radius @xmath34 of a cluster of mass @xmath26 virialized at @xmath35 is computed from @xmath36 , the ratio of the mean cluster density to the mean density of the universe at that epoch .",
    "we evaluate this quantity using the formulae for the spherical collapse model presented in kitayama & suto ( 1996b ) and assuming for simplicity that @xmath35 is equal to the epoch @xmath11 at which the cluster is observed . finally , we compute the mass function @xmath9 in equation ( [ eq : logns ] ) using the press  schechter theory ( press & schechter 1974 ) assuming @xmath37 as above .",
    "the effect of @xmath38 is discussed by kitayama & suto ( 1997 ) in this context , and the more general consideration of @xmath38 is given in lacey & cole ( 1993 ) , sasaki ( 1994 ) , and kitayama & suto ( 1996a , b ) .",
    "the x - ray log@xmath0log@xmath1  for various cold dark matter ( cdm ) models and the resulting constraints on @xmath39 and @xmath40 are summarized in fig.[fig : ns1chi2 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : ns1chi2 ] presents a clear example of the degeneracy among viable cosmological models in a sense that for a given value of @xmath39 , one can find a value of @xmath40 which accounts for the x - ray cluster log@xmath0log@xmath1  .",
    "several examples of such models are listed in table 1 .",

    "( e.g. , eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ; barbosa , bartlett , blanchard , & oukbir 1996 ; fan , bahcall , & cen 1997 ; kitayama , sasaki , & suto 1998 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : logns3 ] plots the cluster log@xmath0log@xmath1  predictions in soft - xray , hard x - ray , and submm ( due to the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ) for models which reproduce the observed log@xmath0log@xmath1  in the soft - xray band ( table 1 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : cont_szac4 ] illustrates the extent to which one can break the degeneracy between @xmath40 and @xmath39 in cdm models ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) using the multi - band observational data .",
    "similarly the redshift - distribution of cluster abundances can be a very powerful discriminator of the different cosmological models .",
    "figure [ fig : nsz ] exhibits the redshift evolution of the number of clusters in different bands . as expected , the evolutionary behavior strongly depends on the values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; the fraction of low redshift clusters becomes larger for greater @xmath39 and smaller @xmath40 .",
    "it is indicated that one may be able to distinguish among these models merely by determining the redshifts of clusters up to @xmath46 . for this purpose , we adopt tentatively the x - ray brightest abell - type clusters ( xbacs , ebeling et al . 1996 ) , which is about 80 % complete and consists of 242 clusters with @xmath47 erg @xmath48 s@xmath49 in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band and @xmath50 . keeping in mind",
    "the incompleteness of the sample and uncertainties especially in the estimated temperature data , however , we simply intend to perform a crude comparison with our predictions in fig .",
    "[ fig : xbacs ] .",
    "the sky coverage of the xbacs is hard to quantify mainly due to the uncertain volume incompleteness of the underlying optical catalogue as noted by ebeling et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : xbacs ] , therefore , we simply plot the real numbers of the xbacs and normalize all our model predictions to match the total number of the xbacs at its flux limit @xmath51 erg @xmath48 s@xmath49and redshift limit @xmath52 . in general , the model predictions are shown to be capable of reproducing well the shape and amplitude of the observed distributions @xmath53 even when @xmath54 and @xmath11 are varied .",
    "taking into account the incompleteness of the observed data and large statistical fluctuations at low numbers , the agreements with models l03 and l03@xmath33 ( both has @xmath55 ) are rather remarkable . since the shapes and amplitudes of the predicted curves in these figures are primarily determined by the value of @xmath39 , this result provides a further indication for low @xmath39 universe .",
    "let us summarize the conclusions of the present talk .",
    "maybe the most important point is that many cosmological models are more or less successful in reproducing the structure at redshift @xmath62 _ by construction_. this is because the models have still several degrees of freedom or _ cosmological parameters _ which can be appropriately _ adjusted _ to the observations at @xmath62 ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath42 , @xmath41 , @xmath63 ) .",
    "we have shown that , given a complete flux limited cluster sample with redshift and/or temperature information , one can further constrain the cosmological models . in fact , our tentative comparison indicates that our predictions reproduce well the evolutionary features of the xbacs and that the results , although preliminary , seem to favor low density ( @xmath64 ) universes . as indicated by this preliminary result , surveys of objects at at high redshifts in several different bands ( x - ray , radio and submm ) are the most efficient and rewarding to break the degeneracy among the viable cosmological models .",
