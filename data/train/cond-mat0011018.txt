    "one reason for the continued growth in cluster science is the link that these finite systems provide between atoms and molecules and bulk systems . indeed",
    ", much cluster research has focussed on the size evolution of cluster properties in order to understand how bulk behaviour , such as phase transitions and crystalline structure , emerge with increasing size . furthermore , from this research new insights into bulk behaviour can often be obtained .",
    "for example , the structure of clusters has often been invoked when considering the local structure of bulk liquids and glasses .",
    "frank may have been the first to make this connection.@xcite he noted that the 13-atom icosahedron has a lower energy than a close - packed cluster for the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential . from this result",
    "he inferred that the most favoured structure of liquids would involve icosahedral local ordering , thus making homogeneous nucleation of a crystal from a liquid difficult , because crystal formation would require a change in the local order.@xcite since then convincing evidence that simple liquids have polytetrahedral@xcite order has been obtained,@xcite and so the use of clusters as models of local order in liquids has become common.@xcite furthermore , clusters with five - fold symmetry are often used as building blocks for quasicrystalline structures@xcite and metallic crystals.@xcite    much of the computational work on supercooled liquids and glasses has focussed on the behaviour exhibited by systems interacting according to simple model potentials .",
    "one of the most commonly studied systems employs a binary lj potential,@xcite where the binary nature of the system hinders the crystallization that readily occurs for a single component lj liquid .",
    "however , recent evidence suggests that the low energy configurations for this system involve some demixing and crystalline ordering.@xcite furthermore , although this system is a good generic glass former , it does not capture all of the features associated with metallic glasses , for which particularly strong local polytetrahedral and icosahedral ordering occurs .",
    "an alternative approach is to use a single component system with a potential that is designed to prevent crystallization .",
    "this line of enquiry was pioneered by dzugutov , who introduced a potential with a local maximum at approximately @xmath0 times the equilibrium pair distance in order to disfavour close - packed structures.@xcite this maximum also bears a resemblance to the first of the friedel oscillations that can occur for metal potentials .",
    "systems interacting according to this dzugutov potential have been found to be good glass - formers , and to exhibit a first sharp diffraction peak and a split second peak in the structure factor,@xcite which are common features of metallic glasses .",
    "one other interesting feature of this potential is that under certain conditions it can produce a dodecagonal quasicrystal.@xcite    our aim here is to further understand the structural implications of the dzugutov potential by identifying the characteristic structural motifs associated with the global minima of dzugutov clusters .",
    "furthermore , we examine the consequences of the potential for the topography of the energy landscape [ or potential energy surface ( pes ) ] of these clusters . as well as the insights into bulk behaviour that these results provide",
    ", they will also be potentially helpful in understanding the structures of clusters that favour polytetrahedral structure .",
    "recent results on small cobalt clusters indicate that they are polytetrahedral,@xcite although the detailed structure is unknown .",
    "furthermore , one would expect clusters of alloys that adopt a frank - kasper structure@xcite in bulk to show polytetrahedral order in clusters .",
    "the dzugutov pair potential is:@xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 , the heaviside step function , is 0 for @xmath3 and 1 otherwise , and the parameters in the potential have the values @xmath4 the total potential energy of a cluster of dzugutov atoms is then @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the distance between atoms @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the pair potential has a minimum at @xmath9=1.130 of depth @xmath10=@xmath11 and a maximum at @xmath12=1.628=1.44@xmath13 of height 0.460 ( @xmath14 .     a comparison of the dzugutov ( dz ) and lennard - jones ( lj ) potentials .",
    "the unit of energy is the pair well depth .",
    "the vertical lines show the positions of the pair distances in the 13-atom icosahedron and their heights are proportional to the numbers of pairs with that distance .",
    ", width=309 ]    in figure [ fig : potential ] we compare the dzugutov and the lj potentials .",
    "the curvature at the bottom of the dzugutov well in the above units is virtually the same as that of the lj potential in reduced units .",
    "however , when the unit of energy for both potentials is the pair well depth , as in figure [ fig : potential ] , the curvature at the minimum of the dzugutov potential is somewhat larger , i.e.  the dzugutov potential well is narrower .    this effect can be quantified . in units of pair",
    "well depth and equilibrium pair separation , the curvature at the minimum of the morse potential @xmath15-               2\\exp\\left[\\rho\\left(1-{r\\over r_{\\rm eq}}\\right)\\right],\\ ] ] is 2@xmath16 and of the generalized lj potential @xmath17\\ ] ] is 2@xmath18 .",
    "these results allow one to calculate an effective @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) value .",
    "for the dzugutov potential @xmath21=@xmath22=7.52 , as compared to @xmath23=6 . this comparison will be important to our interpretation of the structures of these clusters since , as illustrated for morse clusters,@xcite the well width is a key factor in determining a cluster s structure .    for a pair potential we can partition the energy into three terms:@xcite @xmath24 where @xmath10 is the pair well depth , @xmath25 is the number of nearest neighbours ( two atoms are defined as nearest neighbours if @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 we choose @xmath28=1.378 where @xmath29=0 . the first term in equation ( [ eq : esplit ] )",
    "is the ideal pair energy if all @xmath25 nearest - neighbour pairs lie exactly at the equilibrium pair distance .",
    "the strain energy , @xmath30 , is the energetic penalty for the deviation of nearest - neighbour distances from the equilibrium pair distance , and @xmath31 is the contribution to the energy from non - nearest neighbours . for",
    "the dzugutov potential @xmath31 corresponds to the energetic penalty for distances lying near to @xmath32 ( more precisely in the range @xmath33 ) .",
    "the global minimum of a cluster represents the best balance between maximizing @xmath25 whilst minimizing both the strain energy and @xmath31 .",
    "the big difference between the dzugutov potential and most other pair potentials is the local maximum at @xmath12 and the consequent positive value of the term @xmath31 .",
    "this term disfavours distances near to @xmath32 that are associated with the octahedral interstices in close - packed structures . for clusters this term also disfavours marks decahedra@xcite and mackay@xcite icosahedra with more than one shell , because the strained face - centred cubic ( fcc ) tetrahedra that make up these structures contain octahedral interstices .",
    "however , as figure [ fig : potential ] shows , the distances in the 13-atom icosahedron are able to avoid this maximum .",
    "therefore , @xmath31 favours polytetrahedral clusters . for larger polytetrahedral clusters the value of @xmath31",
    "is somewhat correlated with @xmath30 .",
    "strain results from a dispersion of nearest - neighbour distances , and so is also likely to lead to a greater dispersion in the second nearest - neighbour distances and potentially more distances that stray towards the maximum at @xmath12 .",
    "we have previously analysed the roles of @xmath25 and @xmath30 for other pair potentials , such as the morse potential.@xcite a large value of @xmath25 is achieved by having a compact spherical shape with a large proportion of surfaces with high coordination numbers , e.g.  fcc \\{111 } faces .",
    "@xmath30 disfavours strained structures and the magnitude of this term increases as the potential well becomes narrower .",
    "the strain for close - packed structures can be zero , but increases along the series : decahedral , icosahedral and polytetrahedral .",
    "thus , the strain associated with compact polytetrahedral structures can be only accommodated at low @xmath34 values . therefore ,",
    "given the value of @xmath35 , compact polytetrahedral structures seem unlikely and it is not self - evident what types of structure are best able to satisfy these competing demands .      to obtain putative global minima for the dzugutov clusters we used the basin - hopping@xcite ( or monte carlo plus minimization@xcite ) algorithm , which has proved very useful in locating cluster global minima.@xcite in this algorithm a constant temperature metropolis monte carlo simulation",
    "is performed with the acceptance criterion based not upon the energy of the new configuration , but upon the energy of the minimum obtained by a local minimization from that configuration .",
    "details of the basic approach employed in the present work may be found elsewhere.@xcite    dzugutov clusters are particularly challenging cases for global optimization , and so for each cluster size five runs of 100000 steps each starting from a random configuration were performed .",
    "short runs of 10000 steps were also performed for each cluster starting from the lowest - energy minima found for the size above and below with an atom removed and added , respectively . in the latter",
    "runs the seed geometries were fixed for the first 2000 steps .",
    "these short runs were particularly important at larger sizes , and were repeated until there were no further improvements for any size .",
    "in each run a constant temperature of @xmath36 in reduced units was employed , with a fixed maximum step size for cartesian displacements of @xmath37 .",
    "random angular moves were performed for the most weakly bound atom if its pair energy exceeded @xmath38 of the lowest pair energy for the structure in question .",
    "( the pair energy of atom @xmath39 is defined as @xmath40 . )",
    "problems arise in the energy minimizations if atoms evaporate from the cluster : there are no attractive forces on an atom lacking any neighbours within a distance of @xmath12 . as in previous work we constrained the atoms in a sphere to limit the maximum interatomic distances . however , since some global minima of the dzugutov potential exhibit highly non - spherical geometries it was necessary to enlarge the container to twice the radius used in previous work.@xcite atoms with pair energies of zero were therefore shifted towards the origin through a distance of one unit on every call of the potential subroutine .      to map the pes topography of some of the dzugutov clusters we used the same methods as those we have previously applied to lj@xcite and morse@xcite clusters .",
    "we thereby obtain large samples of connected minima and transition states that provide good representations of the low - energy regions of the pes .",
    "the approach involves repeated applications of eigenvector - following@xcite to find new transition states and the minima they connect , as described in detail elsewhere.@xcite       for dzugutov clusters , structures with disclination lines , although not dominant , can be competitive at some sizes . similarly for bulk , under certain conditions",
    "( when the system is somewhat compressed ) a frank - kasper @xmath41-phase is lowest in energy.@xcite    in recent simulations of a bulk dzugutov supercooled liquid , domains corresponding to extended icosahedral configurations have been found to grow as the temperature is decreased and lower - energy minima are sampled.@xcite much lower diffusion rates are associated with atoms in these domains compared with atoms in the rest of the liquid .",
    "the configurations of these icosahedral domains look very similar to the types of non - compact polytetrahedral clusters that we observe for clusters .",
    "both the structures of the clusters and the domains have a common origin in the form of the potential .",
    "in particular , the potential maximum causes polytetrahedral structures to be favoured , and of the possible polytetrahedral structures the width of the potential favours non - compact forms based on icosahedra .",
    "our results also indicate that high - density , compact polytetrahedral structures are disfavoured because they are associated with excessive values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this result has implications for the form of the phase diagram , and in particular the stability of a dense liquid .",
    "most simulations of dzugutov liquids have been performed at constant volume . however , if a dzugutov crystal is heated at a low constant pressure then there is a transition temperature at which the system jumps straight to a low - density phase that resembles a foam.@xcite further simulations suggested that there is no region of the phase diagram where a liquid is stable.@xcite    much work has been done on the effect of the range of a potential on the phase diagram .",
    "this research has shown that when the range is sufficiently short there is no stable liquid phase.@xcite the physical basis for this effect is that as the range of the potential decreases , the potential well becomes narrower and so there is an increasing energetic penalty ( i.e.  @xmath30 ) for the dispersion of nearest - neighbour distances associated with the liquid .",
    "this destabilization of the liquid eventually leads to its disappearance from the phase diagram.@xcite    roth attributed the absence of a liquid phase in the dzugutov phase diagram to the range of the potential.@xcite however , the morse potential with a similar width ( i.e.  @xmath42 ) has a stable liquid phase .",
    "only at much larger values of @xmath20 ( probably 13 - 14 ) does the liquid phase for the morse potential become unstable .",
    "instead , the present study clearly indicates that the absence of a dense liquid phase for the dzugutov potential stems from the maximum neart @xmath32 , because there are insufficient dense , non - crystalline structures with low values of both @xmath31 and @xmath30 .",
    "recently , sear and gelbart showed that adding a long - range repulsion of sufficient magnitude also leads to the disappearance of the liquid from the phase diagram.@xcite as with the much shorter - ranged dzugutov potential the positive value of @xmath31 destabilizes the liquid .",
    "furthermore , as envisaged by lebowitz and penrose,@xcite sear and gilbert found that microphase separation instead occurred.@xcite similar behaviour is seen for the dzugutov potential : low - density non - compact polytetrahedral structures are favourable for clusters , and roth s heating simulations led to a low - density foam rather than a simple vapour.@xcite given this possibility of low - density disordered network phases , calculation of the true phase diagram for the dzugutov potential is of obvious interest .      for simple pair potentials , such as the morse and lj forms , the topography of the pes for 13-atom clusters has been examined in detail,@xcite using near complete sets of minima and transition states . here",
    "we examine some of the consequences of the dzugutov potential for the topography of the energy landscape by comparing the dz@xmath43 and lj@xmath43 pess .",
    "the properties of sets of stationary points for the two clusters are compared in table [ table : dz13 ] .",
    "one of the main differences between the two systems is the much greater number of minima for dz@xmath43 .",
    "we obtained roughly twenty times more minima for dz@xmath43 , yet the sample is far from complete .",
    "transition state searches have been performed from less than 50% of the minima and far fewer searches were performed from each minimum than for lj@xmath43 .",
    "this greater number of minima is a consequence of the local maximum in the potential , which introduces barriers between configurations that would have been in the same basin of attraction for lj@xmath43 . in particular",
    ", there is now a barrier to the formation of nearest - neighbour contacts and so many dz@xmath43 minima involve atoms with low coordination numbers . for the lj potential these atoms would be attracted by the long - range tail of the potential and so would increase their coordination .",
    "for example , when the dz@xmath43 minima are reoptimized for the lj potential 502 of them converge to the icosahedral global minimum .",
    "these differences are particularly evident in the connectivity of the low - energy regions of the pes .",
    "for lj@xmath43 there are over 90 times more transition states connected to the global minimum .",
    "there are less dramatic differences between the other properties of the two pess .",
    "the vibrational frequencies for the dzugutov cluster are somewhat higher because of its slightly larger @xmath34 value.@xcite for larger clusters this effect would be reinforced by the constraints on the second nearest - neighbour distances stemming from the maximum in the potential . however , the latter effect is small for the 13-atom cluster because there are relatively few second nearest - neighbours .",
    "barriers for the dzugutov cluster are generally higher because the barrier for breaking a nearest - neighbour contact involves both loss of the contact energy and overcoming the potential maximum . in general , the barriers are also narrower and connect minima that are closer in configuration space , as expected for a pes with more minima .",
    "the rearrangements are also slightly less cooperative . in summary ,",
    "the dz@xmath43 pes is much rougher than the lj@xmath43 pes .    for larger clusters ,",
    "there are generally a number of low - energy configurations associated with different arrangements of the icosahedral units that make up most low - energy clusters . here",
    "we examine the effects of such competing structures on the pes topography , by calculating the disconnectivity graph for a 37-atom dzugutov cluster . for this cluster",
    "the global minimum , a linear quintuple icosahedron , is slightly lower in energy than a minimum based on the disk - like dz@xmath44 global minimum with an atom removed .",
    "next in energy above these two minima are a series of bent arrangements of five interpenetrating icosahedra .",
    "disconnectivity graphs provide a representation of the barriers between minima on a pes.@xcite in a disconnectivity graph , each line ends at the energy of a minimum . at a series of equally - spaced energy levels",
    "we determine which ( sets of ) minima are connected by paths that never exceed that energy .",
    "lines in the disconnectivity graph join at the energy level where the corresponding ( sets of ) minima first become connected . in a disconnectivity graph",
    "an ideal single - funnel@xcite pes is represented by a single dominant stem associated with the global minimum to which the other minima join directly . for a multiple - funnel pes",
    "there are a number of major stems which only join at high energy .",
    "disconnectivity graph for dz@xmath45 .",
    "only branches leading to the 200 lowest - energy connected minima are included .",
    "the graph was calculated from a set of @xmath46 minima and @xmath47 transition states .",
    "the five lowest - energy minima are depicted alongside the appropriate branches of the graph .",
    ", width=309 ]    the dz@xmath45 disconnectivity graph clearly has a multiple - funnel character .",
    "each of the five lowest - energy structures are separated by large barriers , and the corresponding branches all join up at the node at @xmath48=@xmath49 . for example , the barriers for the lowest - energy pathway between the funnels of the two lowest - energy minima are @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "these large barriers will strongly influence the dynamics , making the rate of interfunnel passage extremely slow .",
    "hence , the low - energy minima act as efficient kinetic traps .    the results for the two clusters in this section also show why the global minima of dzugutov clusters are particularly difficult to locate .",
    "both pes roughness@xcite and multiple - funnel pes topography@xcite have been shown to hinder global optimization .",
    "the latter is particularly troublesome , when , as with dz@xmath45 , the global minimum is at the bottom of a narrow funnel and is thermodynamically most stable only at low temperatures .",
    "these results also have implications for the dynamics of the supercooled dzugutov liquid .",
    "low - energy liquid configurations with different extended icosahedral domains@xcite will be separated by large energy barriers in a manner similar to dz@xmath45 .",
    "therefore , as the average energy of the liquid minima decreases with temperature and the icosahedral domains grow , we expect the effective activation energy associated with diffusion or viscosity to increase , thus leading to fragile ( non - arrhenius ) dynamics.@xcite      the global minima of dzugutov clusters have non - compact polytetrahedral structures .",
    "the interior atoms in these clusters almost always have an icosahedral coordination shell , rather than other polytetrahedral coordination shells that involve disclination lines , because the latter involve too large a strain energy .",
    "the 13-atom icosahedral units that make up the global minima are usually interpenetrating or face - sharing , and both these ways of linking icosahedra are commonly observed in metallic crystals that have icosahedral coordination.@xcite as the size of the clusters increases the arrangements of the icosahedral units change from one - dimensional chains to two - dimensional rings to three - dimensional porous networks .",
    "these results are consistent with the previous observation that the bulk liquid can sustain a distribution of free volume in the form of atomic size vacancies.@xcite    unfortunately , dzugutov clusters , because of their non - compact character , do not provide a realistic model for polytetrahedral metallic clusters , such as those recently observed for cobalt.@xcite however , promising results have been obtained from a modified version of the dzugutov potential that is better able to accommodate the strain associated with compact polytetrahedral structures .",
    "results for this system will be reported elsewhere.@xcite    dzugutov clusters typically have rough multiple - funnel energy landscapes .",
    "these features makes global optimization difficult and have implications for the dynamics of supercooled dzugutov liquids , where extended icosahedral domains,@xcite which are similar to the structures we find for the clusters , grow as the temperature is decreased .",
    "furthermore , our results help to explain why the bulk phase diagram appears not to include a stable liquid , and suggest the possibility of phases with complex low - density network structures ."
