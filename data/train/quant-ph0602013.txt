    "the aim of atom optics is to study and control coherent atomic waves interacting with electromagnetic fields or material structures .",
    "an important tool to implement this control is the spatial confinement of laser cooled atoms , which makes possible their manipulation , trapping , and transport .",
    "reabsorption of scattered photons , in particular , is reduced , so that quantum coherence is more likely to survive @xcite .",
    "waveguides may lead to an atom - optical analog of integrated circuits and much work is in progress to create atom - optical analogs of standard optical components for waveguide structures .",
    "possible applications are information processing and interferometry .",
    "waveguides are also interesting because they counteract gravitational acceleration prolonging observation times , and may help to dispense precise quantities of atoms onto specific regions of a surface in atom lithography @xcite .",
    "there is in addition a growing interest in systems with low dimensionality because of a wealth of characteristic phenomena which do not occur in unconstrained space @xcite : as an example , waveguides with high transverse frequencies have been proposed to realize a one dimensional ( 1d ) gas of impenetrable bosons , the so - called tonks - girardeau gas @xcite . moreover , effective 1d guides allow us to examine in simple geometrical configurations and with the aid of elementary theoretical treatments many fundamental questions in quantum mechanics such as decoherence , definitions and measurements of quantum times , e.g. the arrival time @xcite , or quantum atom statistics @xcite .",
    "all these recent trends and prospects have motivated experimental and theoretical research on localized quantum waves propagating through different structures and confinements .",
    "several techniques and physical interactions have been used to restrict and steer the atomic motion .",
    "atom guiding may be simply carried out by dipolar forces in laser standing waves @xcite , or along a red detuned laser beam .",
    "olshanii et .",
    "proposed to guide atoms in a red detuned laser beam , itself guided in a hollow optical fiber @xcite to facilitate bending .",
    "this idea has been realized @xcite .",
    "another approach is based on reflecting the atoms with the evanescent field of blue detuned light modes guided in a glass fiber tube @xcite .",
    "guides based on hollow ( doughnut ) blue detuned laser beams have been implemented too @xcite .",
    "other major way of guiding atoms is by means of magnetic fields @xcite , in wire - lined hollow fibers or along current carrying wires .",
    "in addition , beam splitters for guided atoms have been demonstrated @xcite , as well as waveguides in two dimensions using magnetic @xcite , or optical fields @xcite .",
    "many intended applications of atoms in waveguides rely on a single - mode atomic propagation . in this respect transversal excitations due to waveguide narrowing @xcite , inhomogeneities because of geometric deformations of the current - carrying wires @xcite , sudden potential variations @xcite , waveguide splitting @xcite , or bending @xcite , have been examined , as well as excited mode measurement by free expansion @xcite , and the decoherence due to thermal fluctuations of the environment @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we start to investigate the effects of including a further control element in the waveguide , namely , a laser beam perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the guide .",
    "such non - guiding fields could be used for many different purposes , such as preparation of specific internal , transversal , or translational states , including in particular transversal cooling , state - selective detection , switching , time dependent trapping , or filtering a privileged direction of motion with an `` atom diode '' @xcite , which has been proposed to implement a new cooling method for longitudinal motion @xcite .",
    "we shall restrict the present article to a simple model consisting in two - level atoms on - resonance with a `` square '' ( semiclassical ) laser beam of finite width @xmath0 , neglecting decay and assuming a rectangular , hard - wall waveguide .",
    "this idealized setting , schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] , has turned out to be interesting and rich enough for a separate and detailed consideration , and additional complications such as detuning , decay , or more realistic profiles and confining potentials will be treated elsewhere . as a main result",
    ", it is found that transversal excitation occurs at `` transversal rabi resonances '' associated with avoided crossings of the mode levels with respect to the rabi frequency .",
    "there is no direct precedent to this analysis , to the best of our knowledge , but some related works are worth mentioning . in a recent study",
    "the possibility to detect single , guided atoms crossing a microcavity has been examined , with a classical treatment of the atomic motion @xcite .",
    "technically our model is the extension to a waveguide configuration of a series of previous one - dimensional models in which simple laser profiles interacting with two or three level atoms have been used to investigate arrival times @xcite , detection optimization @xcite , rabi oscillation suppression @xcite , or `` atom diodes '' @xcite using a quantum treatment of the translational motion .",
    "indeed the present results will , as we shall see , justify the use of these one dimensional models for small values of the ratio between the transverse confinement and the laser wavelength , i.e. , for a small lamb - dicke parameter .",
    "this work is also related to the laser induced vibrational transitions in ion - traps , see @xcite and references therein . in that context",
    "though , the emphasis is on the effect of laser detuning and small rabi frequencies , whereas we shall restrict the present paper to on - resonance ( zero detuning ) interactions .",
    "since the approximations are different ( we will not make use of a `` second '' rotating wave approximation with respect to transversal motion ) , the transitions described here do not appear in the usual treatments of ion - traps , but they become very important , as we shall see , at the rabi resonances mentioned above .     and",

    "it is found that transversal excitation of the atom occurs only at avoided crossings in which the rabi frequency coincides with the transition frequency between the ground and even transversal levels .",
    "the level splitting is proportional to the rabi frequency and lamb - dicke parameter @xmath120 , and also inversely proportional to the square of the transition frequency for the transversal excitation . at",
    "sharp avoided crossings the atomic populations oscillate in the laser region ( in space for stationary waves or in time for quasi - monochromatic wave packets ) with a double frequency pattern . for certain laser widths that depend on the level splitting , there results a transmitted wave with a homogeneous distribution among the four possible states combining ground and even excited transversal states , and ground and excited internal states .",
    "other final states may be achieved by playing with laser detuning .",
    "note that the transitions at transversal rabi resonances are missed in the usual treatments of vibrational excitation in ion traps @xcite . in that field",
    "the emphasis is on the effect of detuning , which has been taken as zero in the present work .",
    "moreover , in that context a second interaction picture is performed with respect to the vibrational hamiltonian so that transitions such as the ones considered here , with involve excitation of both internal and transversal degrees of freedom with zero detuning , are beyond the second rotating - wave approximation applied there , usually within the lamb - dicke regime ( equivalent to our weak coupling case , @xmath194 ) . in future work ,",
    "some of the idealizations of the present model will be removed , considering in particular harmonic rather than hard - wall confinement , detuning , and decay .",
    "detuning combined with laser intensity and beam width are thus expected to serve as useful control knobs to promote or hinder transversal excitation or deexcitation and state selection , providing a promising route for optical atomic control in waveguides ."
