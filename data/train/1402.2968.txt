    "@xcite angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy results also reveal a complex pattern of spin - charge coupling / decoupling both in 1d and 2d systems @xcite in the weak and intermediate - to - strong interaction regimes .",

    "the 1d hubbard model represents a challenging testing ground since both its exact solution and highly accurate density matrix renormalization group results are available .",
    "the last years have seen some progress in this direction within the framework of the single - reference ( sr ) and multi - reference ( mr ) symmetry - projected approximations @xcite which are routinely used in nuclear structure physics .",
    "@xcite note that in quantum chemistry the names single - component and multi - component have been adopted @xcite instead of single - reference and multi - reference , respectively .",
    "recently , a hierarchy of symmetry - projected variational approaches @xcite has been applied to describe both the ground and excited states of the 1d and 2d hubbard models .",
    "@xcite in its simplest ( i.e. , sr ) form , the symmetry - projected variation - after - projection ( vap ) method @xcite resorts to a hartree - fock - type @xcite ( hf ) trial state @xmath7 that deliberately breaks several symmetries of the considered hamiltonian .",
    "the method then superposes , with the help of projection operators , @xcite a degenerate manifold of goldstone states @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being a symmetry operation . in this way one",

    "genuine defects are induced in the intrinsic determinant @xmath7 resulting from the vap procedure .",
    "therefore , its structure differs from the one obtained within the standard hf approximation .",
    "@xcite this kind of sr symmetry - projected framework has already enjoyed considerable success in quantum chemistry . @xcite",
    "an extension of the sr method @xcite has been previously used @xcite to describe half - filled and doped 2d hubbard lattices . with the help of chains of vap calculations",
    ", it provides a ( truncated ) basis consisting of a few ( orthonormalized ) symmetry - projected configurations which can then be used to further diagonalize the considered hamiltonian . in this way , one can account on an equal footing for additional correlations in both ground and excited states keeping well defined symmetry quantum numbers .",
    "the method also provides a well - controlled ansatz to compute both spectral functions ( sfs ) and density of states ( dos ) .",
    "@xcite in quantum chemistry , the first benchmark calculations on the @xmath10 dimer have shown that , with a modest basis set , this methodology provides a high quality description of the low - lying spectrum for the entire dissociation profile .",

    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    however , being already more sophisticated than the sr framework , @xcite the extension @xcite mentioned above still essentially describes a given ground and/or excited state in terms of a single symmetry - projected configuration .",
    "this certainly limits the amount of correlations that can be accessed for those states .",
    "a more correlated description is encoded in a mr scheme .",
    "@xcite here , one resorts to a set of symmetry - broken hf states @xmath14 and superposes their goldstone manifolds @xmath15 . in this way , a given state with a well defined set of quantum numbers",
    "is expanded in terms of @xmath16 nonorthogonal symmetry - projected configurations @xcite that are optimized with the help of the ritz variational principle @xcite applied to the projected energy .",
    "there are several ways to perform the self - consistent optimization of the intrinsic hf states @xmath14 within a mr approach .",
    "one possible vap strategy is represented by the resonating hf @xcite ( reshf ) scheme within which all the determinants @xmath14 are optimized at the same time .",
    "another vap strategy is represented by the few determinant @xcite ( fed ) approach where , the hf transformations @xmath17 are optimized one - at - a - time . in both the reshf and fed schemes , the corresponding configuration mixing coefficients are determined through resonon - like equations .",
    "@xcite we note that there is no need for the fed expansion to be short , as its name would imply , although this is a desirable feature . in the present study",
    ", we keep the acronym to remain consistent with the literature .",
    "@xcite hybrid mr approximations are also possible .",
    "for example , one could optimize @xmath18 states using the reshf scheme and @xmath19 states using the fed one .",
    "the fed methodology has already been used @xcite to compute ground state energies , spin - spin correlation functions ( sscfs ) in real space , magnetic structure factors ( msfs ) as well as spin - charge separation tendencies in the sfs of half - filled 1d hubbard lattices of different sizes in the weak , intermediate - to - strong , and strong interaction regimes .",
    "we have shown @xcite that short reshf and fed expansions can provide an accurate description of chemical systems such as the nitrogen and water molecules along the entire dissociation profile , as well as an accurate interconversion profile among the peroxo and bis(@xmath20-oxo ) forms of [ cu@xmath12o@xmath12]@xmath22 comparable to other state - of - the - art quantum chemical methods .",
    "recent calculations , @xcite have also considered the complex binding pattern in the mo@xmath12 molecule .",
    "in addition to ground state properties , the excited few determinant @xcite ( excited fed ) scheme has also been used @xcite to treat excited states , with well defined quantum numbers , as expansions in terms of nonorthogonal symmetry - projected configurations . as a byproduct of vap calculations",
    ", the excited fed provides a ( truncated ) basis consisting of a few gram - schmidt orthonormalized states , each of them expanded in a given number of nonorthogonal symmetry - projected configurations , which may be used to perform a final diagonalization of the hamiltonian to account for a more correlated description of both ground and excited states .",
    "let us stress , that each of the mr approaches already mentioned has its own advantages and drawbacks .",
    "a reshf wave function is stationary with respect to arbitrary changes in the hf transformations @xcite @xmath23 ( i=1 , @xmath24 , @xmath16 ) while a fed one displays stationarity only with respect to the last added transformation .",
    "therefore , the reshf wave functions become easier to work with in the evaluation of those properties depending on derivatives of the wave function . however , in a reshf optimization , @xmath25 hamiltonian and norm kernels have to be recomputed at every iteration while only @xmath26 kernels are required in an efficient implementation of the fed method .",
    "@xcite    regardless of the fed and/or reshf vap strategy adopted , the mr approximations are not restricted by the dimensionality ( i.e. , they can be equally well applied to 1d and 2d systems ) and/or the topology of the considered lattices . on the other hand , one of the most attractive features of the mr approximations is that they offer compact wave functions , with well defined quantum numbers , whose quality can be systematically improved by increasing the number of symmetry - projected configurations included in the corresponding ansatz .",
    "@xcite obviously , one is always limited in practical applications to a finite number @xmath16 of symmetry - projected terms in the fed and/or reshf expansions .",
    "however , it should also be kept in mind that both the reshf and fed wave functions are nothing else than a discretized form of the exact coherent state representation of a fermion state @xcite and , therefore , become exact in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "all in all , we believe that symmetry - projected approximations , already quite successful in nuclear physics , @xcite lead to a rich conceptual landscape and deserve further attention in quantum chemistry @xcite and condensed matter physics . @xcite they also provide @xcite high quality trial states that can be used within the constrained - path monte carlo @xcite scheme , increasing the energy accuracy and decreasing the statistical variance as more symmetries are broken and restored .    in this paper we apply , for the first time , the fed approach to doped systems .",
    "therefore , our main goal is to test its performance using benchmark calculations . to this end",

    "first , since the nature of the quantum correlations varies for different doping fractions @xmath79 and on - site repulsions , one can expect that the number of ghf transformations required to obtain a given @xmath76 ratio depends on both of them . as already mentioned",

    "it has been shown that the use of such sr symmetry - projected states increases the energy accuracy while decreasing the statistical variance in calculations for large lattices .",
    "given the fact that short fed - like expansions encode a more correlated description of the considered systems , they might be seen as plausible candidates for further improving the previous results .",
    "the mr expansions used in the present study still offer a rich conceptual landscape for further development .",
    "in particular , small vibrations around symmetry - projected mean fields ( i.e. , symmetry - projected tamm dancoff and random phase approximations ) can be consistently formulated .",
    "@xcite such approximations can then be used to access a large number of excited states as required in studies of the optical conductivity in lattice models .",
    "@xcite such calculations are in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "let us stress that symmetry - projected approximations are not restricted by the dimensionality of the considered lattices . in this respect ,",
    "our studies have paved the way for applying the mr methodology to the systematic description of both ground and excited states of 2d square , honeycomb , kagome , and triangular lattices , as well as more involved multi - orbital hubbard models relevant to iron - based superconductors .",
    "@xcite in the realm of quantum chemistry , we plan to further enlarge our current developments @xcite for the molecular hamiltonian .",
