    "in today s world , there are many scenarios where strategic agents with different observations ( i.e. information sets ) interact among themselves to learn about each other , and take actions that affect their reward and further spread of information in the system .",
    "one such scenario was studied in the seminal papers @xcite where the authors investigated the occurrence of fads in a social network , which was later generalized in @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite and @xcite study the problem of learning over a social network where there is a product which is either good or bad .",
    "there are countably many buyers , i.e. _ different decision makers _ , that are chosen exogenously and act exactly once in the process .",
    "they make noisy observation about the value of the product and sequentially act _ strategically _ to either buy or not buy the product .",
    "their actions are based on their own private observation and the actions of the previous users .",
    "it is shown that herding can occur in such a case where a user discards its own private information and follows the majority action of its predecessors ( characterizing fads in social networks ) . as a result",
    ", the user s action does not reveal any new information and all future users repeat this behavior .",
    "this phenomenon is defined as an informational cascade where learning stops for the group as a whole . while a good cascade is desirable , there s a positive probability of a bad cascade that hurts all future users in the community .",
    "there is a growing body of literature on alternative learning models that aim at avoiding bad cascades ( for example see @xcite ) .",
    "there are however more general scenarios , such as cases where players participate in the game more than once , deterministically or randomly , through an exogenous or even an endogenous process .",
    "furthermore , there are practical scenarios where players may be adversarial to each others learning ( e.g. dynamic zero - sum games ) .",
    "studying such scenarios may reveal more interesting and richer equilibrium behaviors including cascading phenomena , not manifested in the models considered in the current literature .",
    "an indispensable tool for studying cascades is a framework for finding equilibria for these dynamical systems involving strategic players with different information sets , which are modeled as dynamic games with asymmetric information .",
    "appropriate equilibrium concepts for such games include perfect bayesian equilibrium ( pbe ) , sequential equilibrium , trembling hand equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "each of these notions of equilibrium consists of a strategy and a belief profile of all players where the equilibrium strategies are optimal given the beliefs and the beliefs are derived from the equilibrium strategy profile using bayes rule",
    "( whenever possible ) . for the games considered in the current literature including  @xcite ,",
    "since every buyer participates only for one time period and thus acts myopically , finding pbe reduces to solving a straightforward , one - shot optimization problem .",
    "however , for general dynamic games with asymmetric information , finding pbe is hard , since it requires solving a fixed point equation in the space of strategy and belief profiles across all users and all time periods ( for a more elaborate discussion , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "there is no known sequential decomposition methodology for finding pbe for such games .",
    "recently we presented a methodology in  @xcite for finding pbe for a general class of dynamic games where a finite number of players have different states associated to them that evolve as conditionally independent markov processes , and are observed perfectly by the corresponding players . in this paper , we start by generalizing that model to the case when players do not perfectly observe their states ; rather they make independent , noisy observations . unlike other scenarios in the cascades literature discussed before ,",
    "the proposed general framework can incorporate , as special cases , scenarios where players participate in the game more than once , deterministically or randomly through an exogenous or endogenous process , and/or scenarios where players may be adversarial to each others learning . for a dynamic game with asymmetric information and a given pbe",
    ", we define informational cascades as those histories of the game where players actions do not depend on their private information from that point on , and thus the system dynamics are governed only through the common information .",
    "we then consider a specific dynamic learning model where each player makes a decision to invest ( or not invest ) in the team , depending on its estimate of the average of all players types . thus learning players types",
    "is important aspect of the problem .",
    "using the methodology presented , we characterize a set of informational cascades for this model where learning stops for the team .",
    "limited as it is , this example provides analysis and intuition on the learning dynamics in decentralized games , and also serves as motivation for exploring a vast landscape of the scenarios that can be studied through the proposed methodology .",

    "<S> the proposed methodology hinges on a sequential decomposition for finding perfect bayesian equilibria ( pbe ) of a general class of dynamic games with asymmetric information , where user - specific states evolve as conditionally independent markov process and users make independent noisy observations of their states . using our methodology </S>",
