    "[ crystalfield ] ( b ) and ( d ) clearly reveal that the t@xmath1 levels are renormalized upon spin orbit coupling .",

    "next we have investigated whether iro@xmath0 can be made magnetic as well as insulating upon increasing the value of @xmath4 . in practical experimental situations ,",
    "this can be done by tuning the ratio between @xmath4 and the bandwidth , @xmath6 .",
    "this can be done experimentally in several ways , e.g. by means of alloying that narrows the bandwidth either by reducing the direct overlap between the ir @xmath5 orbitals , or by means of negative chemical pressure .",

    "as expected , the magnetic moment increases monotonously and the band gap increases nearly linearly with @xmath4 , beyond two critical values of @xmath4 , @xmath64 1.6 ev and @xmath65 4.3 ev for the magnetic transition and the metal - insulator transition , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that soc is neither necessary for stabilizing magnetism nor for the existence of metal insulator transition .",
    "the role of soc is merely to reduce the critical value of @xmath66 and @xmath67 . the ratio @xmath68 ( where @xmath69 ) deviates from the ideal value of 2 due to the deviation from the j@xmath2 = 1/2 character .",
    "however for the ideal structure the j@xmath2 = 1/2 behavior is restored .    the data in fig .",
    "[ bandgap ] show that already for a rather modest value of @xmath4 , one finds a non - magnetic state .",
    "for instance , in the gga+u calculation , a value of @xmath4 = 2 ev results in a spin - polarized ground state , and one may ask how accurate gga+u calculation is in reproducing the ground state properties of this material , especially since a value of @xmath4=1.5 - 2.0 ev is rather realistic for the @xmath5 orbitals in iro@xmath0 .",
    "experimentally it is known that iro@xmath0 is a pauli paramagnet , with a spin - degenerate ground state configuration , and the data in fig .",
    "[ bandgap ] suggest that only @xmath4 values less than 1.6 ev are consistent with this experimental fact .",

    "in this case we found that a spin - degenerate solution is stable , and hence that the experimental ground state is reproduced for realistic values of @xmath4 .",

    "the amplitude of the real part of the optical conductivity in the entire energy range is sightly different when soc is included .",
    "the calculated spectra within gga+u+soc approach shows a feature - for - feature similarity when compared with the experimental results except that the main experimental peak , located around 6.5 ev appear at higher photon energy in our calculation .",
    "similar disagreement has also been reported for fcc ni  @xcite and for some of the spectral properties of cen .",
    "@xcite the fact that the calculated peak appears slightly higher than experiment may indicate that a non - hermitian energy dependent self - energy is important for the correct description of the optical properties .",
    "this has been shown to be the case for other moderately correlated systems .",
    "@xcite to understand the origin of this high energy peak , we have computed the optical conductivity corresponding to interband transitions from the ir @xmath71 valence states to all the conduction states and also o @xmath36 valence states to the conduction states .",

    "[ optics ] ( b ) clearly shows that the main peak arise due to interband transition from o @xmath36 states to the conduction states .",
    "the calculated dos is usually compared with the photoemission spectra ( pes ) , however we know that the dos and pes are not strictly comparable because of the different photoelectric cross - section of the ir-@xmath34 and o-@xmath36 states . in the following we have computed the pes within the so - called single - scatterer final - state approximation .",
    "@xcite here the photocurrent is a sum of local ( atomic - like ) and partial ( @xmath72-like ) density of states weighted by the corresponding cross - sections . in order to take into account the lifetime broadening which increase in proportion to the square of the binding energy within the fermi liquid theory ,",
    "the spectrum has been broadened by a lorentzian function .",
