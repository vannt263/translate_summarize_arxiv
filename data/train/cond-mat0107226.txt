    "during the last decade we have witnessed radical changes in the structure of electricity markets world - wide . for many years",
    "it was argued convincingly that the electricity industry was a natural monopoly and that strong vertical integration was an obvious and efficient model for the power sector .",
    "however , recently it has been recognized that competition in generation services and separation of it from transmission and distribution would be the optimal long - term solution .",
    "restructuring has been designed to foster competition and create incentives for efficient investment in generation assets @xcite .    while the global restructuring process has achieved some significant successes , serious problems  some predictable , others not  have also arisen .",
    "the difficulties that have appeared were partly due to the flaws in regulation and partly to the complexity of the market .",
    "when dealing with the power market we have to bear in mind that electricity can not simply be manufactured , transported and delivered at the press of a button . moreover , electricity is non - storable , which causes demand and supply to be balanced on a knife - edge .",
    "relatively small changes in load or generation can cause large changes in price and all in a matter of hours , if not minutes . in this respect",
    "there is no other market like it .",
    "californians are very well aware of this . in january 2001",
    "california s energy market was on the verge of collapse .",
    "wholesale electricity prices have soared since summer 2000 , see the top panel of fig .",
    "the state s largest utilities were threatening that they would be bankrupted unless they were allowed to raise consumer electricity rates by 30% ; the california power exchange suspended trading and filed for chapter 11 protection with the u.s . bankruptcy court .",
    "how could this have happened when deregulation was supposed to increase efficiency and bring down electricity prices ?",
    "it turns out that the difficulties that have appeared are intrinsic to the design of the market , in which demand exhibits virtually no price responsiveness and supply faces strict production constraints @xcite .",
    "another flaw of deregulation was the underestimation of the rising consumption of electricity in california .",
    "the soaring prices and san francisco blackouts clearly showed that there is a need for sophisticated tools for the analysis of market structures and modeling of electricity load dynamics @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate whether electricity loads in the california power market can be modeled by arma models .",
    "the analyzed database was provided by the university of california energy institute ( ucei , www.ucei.org ) . among other data",
    "it contains system - wide loads supplied by california s independent ( transmission ) system operator .",
    "this is a time series containing the load for every hour of the period april 1st , 1998 ",
    "december 31st , 2000 . due to a very strong daily cycle",
    "we have created a 1006 days long sequence of daily loads .",
    "apart from the daily cycle , the time series exhibits weekly and annual seasonality , see the bottom panel of fig . 1 .",
    "because common trend and seasonality removal techniques do not work well when the time series is only a few ( and not complete , in our case ca .",
    "2.8 annual cycles ) cycles long , we restricted the analysis only to two full years of data , i.e. to the period january 1st , 1999  december 31st , 2000 , and applied a new seasonality reduction technique @xcite .",
    "the seasonality can be easily observed in the frequency domain by plotting a sample analogue of the spectral density , i.e. the periodogram @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the vector of observations , @xmath2 , @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] denotes the largest integer less then or equal to @xmath5 . in the top panel of fig .",
    "2 we plotted the periodogram for the system - wide load .",
    "it shows well - defined peaks at frequencies corresponding to cycles with period 7 and 365 days .",
    "the smaller peaks close to @xmath6 and 0.4 indicate periods of 3.5 and 2.33 days , respectively .",
    "both peaks are the so called harmonics ( multiples of the 7-day period frequency ) and indicate that the data exhibits a 7-day period but is not sinusoidal .",
    "the weekly period was also observed in lagged autocorrelation plots @xcite .    to remove the weekly cycle we used the moving average technique @xcite . for the vector of daily loads @xmath7 the trend",
    "was first estimated by applying a moving average filter specially chosen to eliminate the weekly component and to dampen the noise : @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "next , we estimated the seasonal component . for each @xmath10 , the average @xmath11 of the deviations",
    "@xmath12 was computed .",
    "since these average deviations do not necessarily sum to zero , we estimated the seasonal component @xmath13 as @xmath14 where @xmath10 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "the deseasonalized ( with respect to the 7-day cycle ) data was then defined as @xmath17 finally we removed the trend from the deseasonalized data @xmath18 by taking logarithmic returns @xmath19 , @xmath20 .    after removing the weekly seasonality",
    "we were left with the annual cycle .",
    "unfortunately , because of the short length of the time series ( only two years ) , the method applied to the 7-day cycle could not be used to remove the annual seasonality . to overcome this we applied a new method which consists of the following @xcite :    ( i ) : :    calculate a 25-day rolling volatility @xcite for the whole vector    @xmath21 ; ( ii ) : :    calculate the average volatility for one year",
    ", i.e. in our case    @xmath22 ( iii ) : :    smooth the volatility by taking a 25-day moving average of    @xmath23 ; ( iv ) : :    finally , rescale the returns by dividing them by the smoothed annual    volatility .    the obtained time series ( see the top panel of fig .",
    "3 ) showed no apparent trend and seasonality ( see the bottom panel of fig .",
    "therefore we treated it as a realization of a stationary process .",
    "moreover , the dependence structure exhibited only short - range correlations .",
    "both , the autocorrelation function ( acf ) and the partial autocorrelation function ( pacf ) rapidly tend to zero ( see the bottom panels of fig .",
    "3 ) , which suggests that the deseasonalized load returns can be modeled by an arma - type process .",
    "the mean - corrected ( i.e. after removing the sample mean=0.0010658 ) deseasonalized load returns were modeled by arma ( autoregressive moving average ) processes @xmath24 where @xmath25 denote the order of the model and @xmath26 is a sequence of independent , identically distributed variables with mean 0 and variance @xmath27 ( denoted by @xmath28 in the text ) .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimators @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath27 , respectively , were obtained after a preliminary estimation via the hannan - rissanen method @xcite using all 730 deseasonalized returns .",
    "the parameter estimates and the model size ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) were selected to be those that minimize the bias - corrected version of the akaike criterion , i.e. the aicc statistics @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the maximum likelihood function and @xmath38 .",
    "the optimization procedure led us to the following arma(1,6 ) model ( with @xmath39 ) @xmath40 where @xmath20 and @xmath41 iid@xmath42 .",
    "the value of the aicc criterion obtained for this model was aicc=1956.294 .    in order to check the goodness of fit of the model to the set of data we compared the observed values with the corresponding predicted values obtained from the fitted model .",
    "if the fitted model was appropriate , then the residuals @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the predicted value of @xmath45 based on @xmath46 and @xmath47 , should behave in a manner that is consistent with the model . in our case",
    "this means that the properties of the residuals should reflect those of an iid noise sequence with mean 0 and variance @xmath27 .",
    "the residuals obtained from the arma(1,6 ) model fitted to the mean - corrected deseasonalized load returns are displayed in the top panel of fig .",
    "4 . the graph gives no indication of a nonzero mean or nonconstant variance .",
    "the sample acf and pacf of the residuals fall between the bounds @xmath48 indicating that there is no correlation in the series , see the bottom panels of fig .",
    "4 . recall that for large sample size @xmath49 the sample autocorrelations of an iid sequence with finite variance are approximately iid with distribution @xmath50 .",
    "therefore there is no reason to reject the fitted model on the basis of the autocorrelation or partial autocorrelation function .",
    "however , we should not rely only on simple visual inspection techniques . for our results to be more statistically sound we performed several standard tests for randomness .",
    "the results of the portmanteau , turning point , difference - sign and rank tests are presented in table 1 .",
    "short descriptions of all applied tests can be found in the appendix .",
    ".test statistics and p - values for the residuals . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we can see from table 1 , if we carry out the tests at commonly used 5% level , the tests do not detect any deviation from the iid behavior .",
    "thus there is not sufficient evidence to reject the iid hypothesis .",
    "moreover , the order @xmath51 of the minimum aicc autoregressive model for the residuals also suggests the compatibility of the residuals with white noise , see the appendix .",
    "therefore we may conclude that the arma(1,6 ) model ( defined by eq .",
    "( [ arma ] ) ) fits the mean - corrected deseasonalized load returns very well .",
    "in the previous section we showed that the residuals are a realization of an iid(0,@xmath27 ) sequence .",
    "but what precisely is their distribution ?",
    "the answer to this question is important , because if the noise distribution is known then stronger conclusions can be drawn when a model is fitted to the data .",
    "there are simple visual inspection techniques that enable us to check whether it is reasonable to assume that observations from an iid sequence are also gaussian .",
    "the most widely used is the so - called normal probability plot , see fig .",
    "5 . if the residuals were gaussian then they would form a straight line .",
    "obviously they are not gaussian  the deviation from the line is apparent .",
    "this deviation suggests that the residuals have heavier tails",
    ".    however , we have to bear in mind that in order to comply with the arma model assumptions the distribution of the residuals must have a finite second moment . in the class of heavy - tailed laws with finite variance the hyperbolic distribution seems to be a natural candidate .",
    "the hyperbolic law was introduced by barndorff - nielsen @xcite for modeling the grain size distribution of windblown sand .",
    "it was also found to provide an excellent fit to the distributions of daily returns of stocks from a number of leading german enterprises @xcite .",
    "the name of the distribution is derived from the fact that its log - density forms a hyperbola .",
    "recall that the log - density of the normal distribution is a parabola .",
    "hence the hyperbolic distribution provides the possibility of modeling heavy tails .",
    "the hyperbolic distribution is defined as a normal variance - mean mixture where the mixing distribution is the inverse gaussian law .",
    "more precisely , a random variable has the hyperbolic distribution if its density is of the form @xmath52 where the normalizing constant @xmath53 , @xmath54 , is the modified bessel function with index 1 , the scale parameter @xmath55 , the location parameter @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the latter two parameters  @xmath58 and @xmath59  determine the shape , with @xmath58 being responsible for the steepness and @xmath59 for the skewness .    given a sample of independent observations all four parameters can be estimated by the maximum likelihood method . in our studies",
    "we used the hyp program @xcite to obtain the following estimates @xmath60 the empirical probability density function ( pdf )  to be more precise : a kernel estimator of the density  together with the estimated hyperbolic pdf are presented in fig .",
    "we can clearly see that , on the semi - logarithmic scale , the tails of the residuals density form straight lines , which justifies our choice of the theoretical distribution .",
    "the adjusted kolmogorov statistics @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the theoretical and @xmath63 is the empirical cummulative distribution function , returns the value @xmath64 .",
    "this indicates that there is not sufficient evidence to reject the hypothesis of the hyberbolic distribution of the residuals at the 1% level .",
    "for comparison we fitted a gaussian law to the residuals as well . in this case",
    "the adjusted kolmogorov statistics returned @xmath65 causing us to reject the gaussian hypothesis of the residuals at the same level .",
    "due to limited monitoring in a power distribution system its loads usually are not known in advance and can only be forecasted based on the available information . in this paper",
    "we showed that it is possible to model deseasonalized loads via arma processes with heavy - tailed hyperbolic noise .",
    "this method could be used to forecast loads in a power market .",
    "its effectiveness , however , still has to be tested and will be the subject of our further research .",
    "the portmanteau test . : :    instead of checking to see if each sample autocorrelation    @xmath66 falls inside the bounds    @xmath67 , where @xmath49 is the sample    size , it is possible to consider a single statistic introduced by    ljung and box @xcite    @xmath68 , whose    distribution can be approximated by the @xmath69    distribution with @xmath70 degrees of freedom .",
    "a large value of    @xmath71 suggests that the sample autocorrelations of the    observations are too large for the data to be a sample from an iid    sequence .",
    "therefore we reject the iid hypothesis at level    @xmath58 if @xmath72 , where    @xmath73 is the @xmath74    quantile of the @xmath69 distribution with @xmath70    degrees of freedom . the turning point test .",
    ": :    if @xmath75 is a sequence of observations , we say    that there is a turning point at time @xmath76    ( @xmath77 ) if @xmath78 and    @xmath79 or if @xmath80 and    @xmath81 .",
    "in order to carry out a test of the iid    hypothesis ( for large @xmath49 ) we denote the number of turning    points by @xmath82 ( @xmath82 is approximately    @xmath83 , where @xmath84    and @xmath85 ) and we reject this    hypothesis at level @xmath58 if    @xmath86 , where    @xmath87 is the @xmath88    quantile of the standard normal distribution .",
    "the large value of    @xmath89 indicates that the series is fluctuating more    rapidly than expected for an iid sequence ; a value of    @xmath89 much smaller than zero indicates a positive    correlation between neighboring observations . the difference - sign test . : :    for this test we count the number @xmath90 of values    @xmath76 such that @xmath91 ,    @xmath92 . for an iid sequence and for large    @xmath49 ,",
    "@xmath90 is approximately    @xmath93 , where @xmath94    and @xmath95 . a large positive ( or negative )",
    "value of @xmath96 indicates the presence of an increasing    ( or decreasing ) trend in the data .",
    "we therefore reject the assumption    of no trend in the data if    @xmath97 . the rank test .",
    ": :    the rank test is particularly useful for detecting a linear trend in    the data .",
    "we define @xmath98 as the number of pairs    @xmath99 such that @xmath100 and    @xmath101 , @xmath102 . for an iid sequence and    for large @xmath49 , @xmath98 is approximately    @xmath103 , where @xmath104    and @xmath105 .",
    "a large positive    ( negative ) value of @xmath106 indicates the presence of an    increasing ( decreasing ) trend in data .",
