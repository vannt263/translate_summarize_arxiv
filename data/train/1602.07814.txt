    "frustration usually induces more complex , and therefore interesting , new physics . in conjunction with disorder , like in glasses for example , frustration leads , at sufficiently low temperature , to a complete freezing of the system over accessible time scales . in pure systems , in particular in magnetic systems , an increase of the degeneracy of the ground state",
