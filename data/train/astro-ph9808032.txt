    "on one hand , the success of the cosmic microwave background explorer ( cobe ; smoot 1992 ) can hardly be overstated ; it revolutionized our way of quantifying cosmology . on the other hand ,",
    "it did little justice to enthusiastic cosmologists : rather than helping us nail down to an ultimate model , it proded us to introduce more models ( or variants ) to meet with the new observational constraint .",
    "post - cobe era is filled with new ideas about models at the expense of introducing more parameters to the simple , non - flavored , standard cold dark matter model ( peebles 1982 ; blumenthal 1984 ) , which has been remarkably successful in matching a large set of local observations for the past decade ( e.g. , davis 1985 ; white 1986 ; frenk 1988 ; park 1990 ; cen & ostriker 1992a and references therein ) , although some evidence of its lack of large - scale power began to emerge ( e.g. , maddox 1990 ) in the early nineties ( see ostriker 1993 for an excellent review ) .",
    "the flourish of new models is largely thanks to the general consensual requirement that any cosmological model match both the cobe observation on large scales at an early epoch and local observations , primarily of distributions of galaxies .",
    "the newly introduced models that are deemed to be interesting are mostly based on the general success of the standard cold dark matter model .",
    "the variants arise by introducing one or two more parameters to the standard critical density cdm model with zeldovich primordial spectrum : the shape of the power spectrum ( characterized by the primordial power index on the large scales , @xmath2 ) and/or the composition of the universal matter including vacuum energy density ( cosmological constant ) .",
    "it should be noted that variations of the latter also change the overall shape of the power spectrum , quite separate from the primordial spectrum .",
    "the consequence of allowing such added freedom is the current state of a degenerate set of  viable \" cobe and cluster - normalized cdm models typified by the tilted cold dark matter model ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the mixed cold dark matter model ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the cold dark matter model with a non - zero cosmological constant ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the open cold dark matter model ( gott 1982 ; bucher , goldhaber , & turok 1995 ) . although noticeably being paid significantly less attention to , the primeval baryon isocurvature model ( pbi , peebles 1987a , b ; cen , ostriker , & peebles 1993 ) still appears contentious , especially with its virtue of early structure formation .    after a general world model is chosen ( i.e. , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and",
    "dark matter and baryonic compositions are chosen ) , the shape and the overall amplitude of its power spectrum are yet to be fixed before the model becomes completely deterministic .",
    "cobe provides one fixing point at large scales ( @xmath6mpc ) .",
    "the abundance of local rich clusters of galaxies provides another fixing point at intermediate scales ( @xmath7mpc ) .",
    "both points are currently determined to an accuracy of @xmath0 .",
    "once the power spectrum is also fixed , the entire history of a model universe can , in principle , be computed .",
    "sufficiently accurate numerical techniques with sufficiently realistic physical modeling have become more available due to parallel advances in both computer hardware and software capabilities to allow for accurate predictions for at least some aspects or phenomena of the cosmic structure formation to be made , which can be compared to observations on various scales and at various epochs .",
    "examples are @xmath1 clouds ( cen 1994 ; zhang 1995 ; hernquist 1996 ; mcor ) , x - ray clusters ( kang 1994 ; bryan 1994 ; cen & ostriker 1994a ; frenk 1998 ) and gravitational lensing by clusters of galaxies and large - scale structure ( cen 1994 ; wambsganss 1995 ) .",
    "parallel in time , rapid advances in observational capabilities in recent years , thanks in large part to the ground - based 10-meter class keck telescopes as well as the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , make possible explore regimes which were previously unaccessible . for example , hst opens a brand new window to studying the formation and evolution of galaxies to a much higher redshift than before ( e.g. , lowenthal 1997 ) and quasar absorption systems at some entirely new wavelength bands ( e.g. , bahcall 1996 ) .",
    "observations by keck telescopes have made possible routinely record high quality quasar absorption spectra ( e.g. , hu 1995 ) , providing new opportunities to conduct detailed studies of lyman alpha forest lines and related metal line systems ( e.g. , lu 1997 ) .",
    "observations of lyman break galaxies using keck telescopes have opened yet another new window to the universe at high redshift ( steidel 1998 , s98 henceforth ) .",
    "deeper and larger surveys of x - ray clusters of galaxies as well as optically identified clusters of galaxies are pushing the redshift of observed rich , luminous and hot clusters to beyond unity ( e.g. , rosati 1998 ) .",
    "more excitingly , more and rapid observational advances are expected to take place in the near future in anticipation of many large projects and next generation telescopes convering a variety of wavelengths from meterwave to @xmath8-ray .",
    "this paper attempts to interface between these two developments . to set a standard for comparing different models and for comparing results between different workers in the field , we adopt the set of six cdm models presented in cen ( 1998 ; c98 henceforth ) for detailed analyses .",
    "all the models are normalized to both cobe on large scales and the observed abundance of local rich clusters of galaxies , thus titled  viable \" . the goal of this paper is to address the opportunities that new observations are and will soon be providing us with new ways to test these remaining ,  viable \" models .",
    "it is hoped that some theoretical insight may be extracted to help highlight some potentially promising observations for ( at least ) the purpose of testing cosmological models .",
    "it is exciting that each of the independent observations examined here , mostly at moderate - to - high redshift , seems to be or potentially be capable of distinguishing between at least some of the models .",
    "the combined power of several of these observations is tremendous , enabling the possibility of nailing down the ultimate cosmological model with high precision .",
    "it is perhaps more important that different observations at completely different scales and/or epochs should provide an overall consistency check of the general gravitational instability picture and/or gaussianity of the primordial density fluctuations .",
    "the main results of the paper are organized as follows .",
    "the parameters of a suite of six cdm models that are normalized to cobe and local cluster abundance are discussed in  2 . ",

    "when normalized to both cobe on very large scales and the abundance of local rich clusters of galaxies , both the shape ( @xmath2 ) and amplitude of the power spectrum ( @xmath36 ) of any model are fixed to about 10% accuracy ( c98 ) .",
    "these six models are determined to this accuracy .",
    "the tcdm model has @xmath37 but with a tilt on the primordial power spectrum .",
    "the hcdm model has @xmath37 with 20% mass in massive neutrinos .",
    "two neutrino species of equal mass are assumed . ocdm25 and ocdm40 are two open models and @xmath30cdm25 and @xmath30cdm40 are two low density but flat models with a cosmological constant .",
    "except the open models , a tensor component is added when normalizing each model to cobe with tensor to scalar ratio @xmath38 ( liddle & lyth 1992 ; davis 1992 ; crittenden 1993 ; stewart & lyth 1993 ) . note that some tilt is present in all models listed , required to match both cobe and local cluster abundance .",
    "this set of six cdm models likely brackets all potentially interesting models .",
    "the baryon densities for ocdm25 and @xmath30cdm25 are computed using @xmath39 ( walker 1991 ) , and for the remaining four models using @xmath40 ( burles & tytler 1997 ) .",
    "these choices of @xmath41 for the models are made to maximize the viability of each model with respect to the observed gas fraction in x - ray clusters of galaxies ( white 1993b ; lubin 1996 ; danos & pen 1998 , @xmath42 ) .",
    "the power spectrum transfer functions for all the models are computed using cmbfast code developed by seljak and zaldarriaga .",
    "the choice of the hubble constant is made for each model such that each model is consistent with current measurements of the hubble constant .",
    "it appears that @xmath43km / s / mpc can account for the distribution of the current data from various measurements ( see , e.g. , trimble 1997 ) , except for those from sunyaev - zeldovich observations ( for a discussion of a reconciliation of this difference , see c98 ) .",
    "another consideration is that the age constraint from latest globular cluster observations / interpretations ( c.f . , salaris , deglinnocenti , & weiss 1997 ) is not violated",
    "while cobe and local cluster abundance combine to provide an unprecedented accuracy of fixing models in terms of limiting the parameter space , some degeneracy remains .",
    "it is therefore essential to examine other , independent observations to help further tighten the parameter space .",
    "we will examine various observations in this section using the six models listed in table 1 as a testbed .",
    "we consider nine independent observations in order of ascending redshift : the cluster correlation function at low redshift (  3.1 ) , the galaxy power spectrum from sdss (  3.2 ) , and evolution of rich cluster abundance (  3.3 ) , the gravitational lensing by moderate - to - high redshift clusters of galaxies (  3.4 ) , the @xmath1 forest (  3.5 ) , the damped @xmath1 systems (  3.6 ) , the high redshift galaxies (  3.7 ) , the reionization of the universe (  3.8 ) and the future cmb experiments (  3.9 ) .",
    "( 400,250 )    ( 400,250 )    before examining the correlation functions of the six models , it is worthwhile to understand factors that determine the cluster correlation function .",
    "figure 1 shows the cluster - cluster two - point correlation length ( i.e. , the scale at which the correlation function is unity ) , computed using the gaussian peak method ( gpm , c98 ) , as a function of @xmath3 for clusters with mean separation of @xmath45mpc ( light dashed curves ) and @xmath46mpc ( light solid curves ) , respectively .",
    "for all models shown here , we use @xmath47 with the cdm transfer function from bbks and normalize to the local cluster abundance ( equation 36 of c98 ) but not necessarily to cobe . from figure 1",
    "it immediately becomes clear that the cluster correlation function almost does not depend on @xmath4 at all , only weakly depends on @xmath3 and somewhat moderately depends on @xmath36 : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , given the uncertainties in fixing @xmath36 of a model , uncertainties in the shape of the power spectrum and uncertainties in the observed correlation length of clusters , it is not possible to constrain @xmath3 using correlation functions of clusters of galaxies , _ unless models with different @xmath3 also substantially differ in @xmath51 on the relevant large scales ( @xmath52mpc)_.    fortunately , the power spectra of various models with different @xmath3/@xmath4 are indeed quite different ( table 1 ) , as required to fit both cobe and local rich cluster abundance .",
    "figure 2 shows the power spectra ( in real space ) for the six models in table 1 .",
    "it is seen that normalizing to both cobe and clusters results in a wide disparity in shape and amplitude of the power spectra of the models in a wide range of scales . the correlation length of clusters of galaxies in the six models",
    "are then shown in figure 3 in a somewhat different manner , where the correlation length in each model is plotted against the mean separation of the clusters in question .",
    "note that the mean separation of a set of clusters is the mean separation of a set of the richest ( most massive ) clusters in a model ; clusters are rank - ordered in mass and selected in descending order in mass .",
    "we see that there exists significant differences between different models shown here .",
    "since we have explicitly shown earlier that the dependence of the correlation length on @xmath3 and @xmath4 is rather weak , the differences in the correlation lengths between the models shown here chiefly attribute to the differences in the power on large scales between the models .",
    "the trend is clear and physically understandable : the more power a model has on large scales @xmath53mpc , the stronger dependence of the correlation length on the richness of the clusters ( see figure 2 to compare the power spectra of the models ) is displayed , consistent with previous findings ( bahcall & cen 1992 ; croft & efstathiou 1994 ) .",
    "it is evident that the correlation length of clusters of galaxies sets a useful constraint on models .",
    "if the measurement accuracy can reach @xmath54mpc , one can potentially strongly differentiate between models .",
    "it is also clear that it will be more useful to reduce the observational errorbars of the correlation length of very rich clusters ( e.g. , @xmath55mpc ) for the purpose of testing models , since the models differ most there .",
    "stated somewhat more quantitatively in a hypothetic sense , were the @xmath56 errorbar of the solid dot in figure 3 smaller than @xmath57mpc , all the models considered here are ruled out at a very high confidence level ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "consistent with other observations ( e.g. , maddox 1990 ) and previous results of clustering analyses of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , bahcall & cen 1992 ; croft & efstathiou 1994 ) , the standard @xmath37 cdm model even with a significant tilt of the power spectrum ( @xmath59 , tcdm ) is in disaccord with currently available observations due to the lack of large - scale power .",
    "hcdm model and all other , low density models are consistent with available observations of cluster correlations .",
    "( 400,300 )    the sloan digital sky survey now underway ( knapp , lupton , & strauss 1996 ) will provide a tremendously large database for a variety of objects .",
    "realizing its full value will perhaps require the work by generations of astronomers .",
    "one obviously valuable piece of information that can be extracted immediately upon the availability of the distribution of galaxies from sdss , up to very large scales previously unreached in full three dimension .",
    "figure 4 shows the power spectra of galaxies for the six models ( table 1 ) _ in redshift space _ at @xmath44 .",
    "the shown galaxy power spectrum in redshift space for each model is related to the linear matter power spectrum in real space by the following relation : @xmath60 in the above relation the first term on the right hand side is due to linear peculiar velocity distortion ( kaiser 1987 ) and the second term on the right hand side reflects the ( linear ) bias of galaxies over mass in order for each model to be consistent with the observed galaxy density fluctuations at z=0 . for tcdm , we also show the errorbars ( @xmath56 ) that sdss can achieve , adopted from goldberg & strauss ( 1998 ) .",
    "errorbars for other models are the same but not shown for readability of the figure .",
    "it is clear that the sdss galaxy power spectrum in a large range in @xmath61 from @xmath62mpc to @xmath63mpc will provide some discriminatory tests of the models .",
    "taken at face value , it seems that the errorbars are smallest at the highest @xmath61 , where the data points may provide the most discriminating test of the models .",
    "but we caution that nonlinear effects may wash out some of the differences between the models at the high @xmath61 end ( e.g. , gramann , cen & bahcall 1993 ) .",
    "we should only conservatively estimate the discriminating power of the galaxy power spectrum from sdss at @xmath64/mpc , where the nonlinear effects are relatively mild .",
    "a close examination of figure 4 reveals that there is not a pair of models that have the same power at @xmath65mpc within the @xmath56 errorbars provided by sdss .",
    "therefore , sdss should be able to test all these models at a confidence level @xmath66 .",
    "the purpose of this investigation is to illustrate the potential of sdss galaxy power spectrum in placing strong constraints on models .",
    "quantitative comparisons will have to be made between large - scale , fully nonlinear cosmological galaxy formation simulations ( cen & ostriker 1992b,1993b,1998 ) and observations .",
    "( 400,300 )    let us now study the evolution of the cluster mass functions in the six models ( table 1 ) , computed using gpm ( c98 ) . figure 5 displays the mass functions for the models at four redshifts , @xmath67 .",
    "the cluster mass is defined as the mass in a sphere of _ comoving _ abell radius ( @xmath68mpc ) at all redshifts .",
    "again , _ all models are normalized to the observed mass function at redshift zero as well as cobe_. as one would have naively expected , the evolution is strongest in the @xmath37 models ( 5a , b ) and weakest in the open , lowest density model ( 5c )",
    ". it must be stressed , however , as we will show shortly , that the physical reason for this trend may come as a surprise . _",
    "the underlying cause is @xmath36 , not @xmath3 . _",
    "the hcdm ( 5b ) shows a comparable rate of evolution to tcdm ( 5a ) because the reduction of power on smaller scales @xmath69h / mpc is roughly compensated by a comparable increase of power on larger scales @xmath70h / mpc in hcdm compared to tcdm .",
    "other models show intermediate rates of evolution , in a comprehensible order .",
    "figure 6 is similar to figure 5 with the only difference being that the cluster mass is now defined as the mass in a sphere of _ proper _ abell radius ( @xmath68mpc ) at all redshifts .",
    "the trend between models is similar in figure 6 to that in figure 5 .",
    "but the evolutionary rates in all models are dramatically smaller in figure 6 than in figure 5 .",
    "this says that the mass of clusters within a physical radius evolves much more slowly than the mass of clusters within a comoving radius .",
    "this is trivial , since a fixed physical radius corresponds to a larger comoving radius at a higher redshift thus its sphere contains more mass than its counterpart with the comoving radius .",
    "a more subtle difference between the models is that the evolution of the mass function for the low density open model ( ocdm25 ) to redshift unity ( the bottom curve in figure 6c ) is much smaller than that of any other model . in other words",
    ", the mass of clusters within a physical radius in ocdm25 evolves only very slowly .",
    "an equivalent , conventional but perhaps conceptually simpler way to put",
    "this is that the clusters in ocdm25 virialize early at @xmath71 and later mass accretion onto the formed clusters through the surface of the indicated radius is modest .",
    "( 400,300 )    we would summarize the trends for clarity .",
    "_ cluster mass function is a monotonic function in time : the abundance of clusters at a fixed mass ( at least in the range of mass considered here from @xmath72 to @xmath73 ) decreases with increasing redshift . for all cobe and cluster ( at @xmath44 )",
    "normalized models , the lower is @xmath3 , the weaker is the evolution ; for two models with a same @xmath3 , an addition of a cosmological constant enhances the evolution , _ especially beyond a certain high redshift when the values of @xmath74 in the two models ( with and without a cosmological constant ) start to deviate significantly from one another .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the faster evolution in the low density models than in the high density models is somewhat coincidental ( due to @xmath75 relation required to fit local rich cluster abundance , equation 36 of c98 ) and entirely due to the normalization on @xmath36 , not due to @xmath3 , as will be shown below .",
    "( 400,250 )    presenting the above results shown in figures ( 5,6 ) in a slightly different form , panel ( a ) of figure 7 shows the evolution of the number of clusters with mass of @xmath76 within a fixed _ proper _ radius of @xmath77mpc , and panel ( b ) of clusters with mass of @xmath78 .",
    "the quantity in the ordinate is the number of clusters per unit redshift per unit steradian . since the number of clusters per unit redshift _ per unit sold angle _",
    "is plotted , one has to take account the different geometries in different model universes ( the comoving volume element per steradian per unit redshift about @xmath79 is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the comoving angular diameter distance to redshift @xmath79 and @xmath82 is the comoving distance to redshift @xmath79 ; see equations 6 , 8 below for definitions of @xmath81 and @xmath83 ) .",
    "it is seen that the less massive , low redshift clusters shown in panel ( a ) has much less discriminating power than the more massive , higher redshift clusters shown in panel ( b ) .",
    "while the observed clusters at @xmath84 ( panel a ) are not able to differentiate between any models at a significant confidence level , the observed clusters at @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( panel b ) offer a clean way to separate the @xmath37 models from the rest .",
    "it seems quite secure to conclude that both @xmath37 tcdm and hcdm models are ruled out at a high confidence level ( @xmath87 ) , whereas the current observations are not able to differentiate between the four low density models .",
    "this conclusion is in broad agreement with the conclusions drawn by henry & arnaud ( 1991 ) , bahcall , fan & cen ( 1997 ) and carlberg ( 1997 ) .",
    "reichart ( 1998 ) claim that the x - ray cluster luminosity function from einstein medium sensitivity survey are consistent with @xmath37 .",
    "it is unclear at this time what causes the difference .",
    "however , reichart ( 1998 ) claim that their conclusion is independent of @xmath36 ( i.e. , the amplitude of the power spectrum ) , which is in direct conflict with the demonstration that @xmath36 is the primary factor that determines the redshift evolution of massive clusters , as shown below .",

    "if the universe is open , one will be able to determine @xmath3 with an accuracy of @xmath119 ( by interpolating between ocdm25 and ocdm40 ) .",
    "these accuracies are comparable to those which will be determined from the next generation microwave background fluctuation experiments ( e.g. , zaldarriaga , spergel , & seljak 1997 ) , thus provide a very powerful test and also a very important consistency cross - check .",

    "in other words , the rate of evolution for cluster abundance is strongly model - dependent .",
    "it is useful to understand what cause such dramatic differences in the evolution rates between the different models .",
    "for this let us first define an evolution rate of cluster ( with mass @xmath120 ) number density as a function of @xmath36 as @xmath121 this is the change of cluster abundance in logarithmic scale per unit redshift .",
    "this definition is similar to that defined in fan , bahcall , & cen ( 1998 ; equation 8) but with the difference that the current @xmath122 is a function of @xmath36 and @xmath123 , not a function of @xmath79 and @xmath123 . in this sense",
    "the current definition of rate of evolution is local in time ; redshift @xmath79 in equation 2 serves as a ruler or a unit .",
    "figure 8a shows the evolution rate of the number density of clusters with mass @xmath124 , defined within a comoving abell radius ( panel a ) and within a physical abell radius ( panel b ) , respectively .",
    "the first thing to notice is that , not surprisingly , the evolution rate is lower for clusters defined within a physical abell radius than within a comoving abell radius .",

    "however , it is interesting to note that , _ at a fixed @xmath36 _ , the evolution rates in the low @xmath3 models are _ higher , not lower _ , than the rates in the @xmath37 models for clusters defined within the comoving abell radius ( panels a ) .",
    "the situation is altered for clusters defined within the physical abell radius : _ at a fixed @xmath36 _ , the evolution rate is _ lowest _ in ocdm25 . in any case these differences are secondary compared to the difference of @xmath133 between different @xmath36 within a same model .",

    "we conclude that the dramatic differences in the evolution rates between the different models are _ almost entirely caused by the differences in @xmath36 _ between the models , which results from the requirement that each model has to fit the cluster abundance at @xmath44 . _",

    "this thus seems to provide an additional piece of evidence that damped @xmath1 systems may be the progenitors of present large disk galaxies .",

    "bearing in mind that the computed quantity is an upper bound , we see that hcdm is inconsistent with observations at a high confidence level , in agreement with the conclusion drawn by ma ( 1997 ) for a comparable model , and consistent with previous analyses ( subramanian & padmanabhan 1994 ; kauffmann & charlot 1994 ; mo & miralda - escud 1994 ; klypin 1995 ) , which use an hcdm model with a somewhat larger fraction of mass being in hot neutrinos ( @xmath204 ) .",

    "all the other models are consistent with observations with perhaps the exception of ocdm25 ( open @xmath110 ) , which appears to have overproduced the neutral hydrogen gas in these systems .",

    "such a choice of selection function seems appropriate for the observational technique used which optimizes detection at @xmath209 ( pettini 1997 , private communications ) , and should be adequate for our purpose in the sense that our results do not sensitively depend on the choices of @xmath212 and @xmath216 within reasonable ranges . by the way",

    "preliminary observational evidence indicates that the high redshift galaxies have velocity dispersions in the range @xmath221km / s ( steidel 1996 ) .",

    "overmerging of galaxies ( identified with halos ) in n - body simulations is error - prone due to lack of realistic physics / sufficient resolution . in real world , although halos may still merge , most galaxies are likely to retain their separate identities ( for example , a rich cluster like coma contains hundreds of galaxies but might consist of only a handful of dark matter halos ) .",

    "if halo merger is more important in objects such as the observed galaxy concentration in the real world , inclusion of some merger effects would exacerbate the problem , as merger would reduce the number of galaxies in high density region ( as considered here ) and reduce the bias of galaxies ( in number ) over mass in the models .",

    "cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( cen & ostriker 1993a ; ostriker & cen 1996 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) as well as analytic analyses ( haiman & loeb 1997 ) have demonstrated that the detailed picture of reionization of the universe depends on many uncertain parameters , including the properties of the ionizing sources , the clumpiness of the baryonic density field , the mean baryonic density , etc .    we want to address the following comparatively simpler question : when was the universe completely reionized ?",
    "it is possible to obtain a relatively accurate result if one only wants to identify the epoch when the universe gets completely reionized ( ignoring the detailed development of the reionization process ) . in this case one",
    "just needs to count the number of ionizing photons .",
    "when the number of ionizing photons emitted per hydrogen atom in one ( hydrogen ) recombination time is equal to one , the universe ( with regard to hydrogen ) is completely ionized .",
    "we now formulate this criterion quantitatively , assuming that the universe is reionized primarily by uv ionizing radiation from massive stars of early galaxies .",

    ", we can write down the equation , equating the number of ionizing photons emitted per hydrogen atom in a recombination time to unity , as : @xmath295 where @xmath296 is the fraction of total baryonic matter that has collapsed and condensed out to form galaxies per unit redshift , @xmath297 is proton mass , @xmath144 is the speed of light and @xmath298 ( @xmath299ev ) is the hydrogen ionization potential . using equations ( 14,15 ) to expand equation ( 16 )",

    "an accurate treatment of this problem awaits detailed galaxy formation simulations with a sufficiently realistic treatment of three - dimensional radiative transfer .",
    "the present study serves to illustrate the large differences between models with regard to the reionization epoch , which may survive detailed , more accurate simulations . in the present treatment",
    "all these various factors have been conveniently condensed into the single parameter @xmath301 , being the fraction of the rest mass of stars that turn into ionizing uv photons escaping into the igm .",
    "we will use @xmath302 , which is lower than the values previously used ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; cen & ostriker 1998 ) by approximately a factor of two .",
    "this factor of two is intended to account for the slight over - counting of the number of ionizing photons in equation 16 , where all ionizing photons are treated to be at lyman limit , in contrast to an orion - like spectrum of a young stellar association ( scalo 1986 ) .",
    "a clumping factor @xmath303 is used , which may be uncertain by a factor of a few , perhaps in the upward direction .",
    "( 400,300 )    the required galaxy formation rate per unit redshift @xmath304 ( equation 17 ) is shown as the cross - shaded bands in figure 14 , where the upper and lower limits are due to the uncertainty in @xmath294 .",
    "the solid curves in figure 14 show the fraction of matter in collapsed ( virialized ) systems per unit redshift with velocity dispersion greater than @xmath273km / s ( corresponding to virial temperature of @xmath305kelvin ) , as a function of redshift , that are assumed to emit the ionizing photons .",
    "smaller systems are unlikely to be able to collapse due to the lack of efficient coolants at @xmath306k in the presence of significant photo - ionizing radiation field ( efstathiou 1992 ; quinn , katz , & efstathiou 1996 ) or in the presence of feedback processes from young galaxies ( cen & ostriker 1993a ) ; molecular hydrogen could have served as an efficient coolant at the lower temperatures but they are likely to have been destroyed long before these sub - galactic size objects start to form ( ostriker & gnedin 1996 ; haiman , rees , & loeb 1997 ) .",
    "cccccccccc    tcdm & @xmath307 hcdm & @xmath308 ocdm25 & @xmath309 ocdm40 & @xmath310 @xmath30cdm25 & @xmath311 @xmath30cdm40 & @xmath312    ( 400,270 )    we see that different models predict quite different epochs of reionization of the universe , which are tabulated in table 4 for the ease of comparison .",
    "it is noted that the exact epoch of reionization is quite insensitive to small variations of @xmath301 or the degree of clumpiness of the medium , simply because it is during the rapidly rising part of the evolution of the collapse fraction when the reionization occurs .",
    "it is clear that observations to higher redshift would provide a powerful discriminator between models .",
    "for example , if the universe is observed to be transparent at @xmath313 , then hcdm will be inviable ; if the universe is observed to be transparent at @xmath314 , the all but the open models will be ruled out .",
    "while it is beyond the scope of current paper to conduct detailed calculations of the properties of high redshift objects around the reionization epoch in each model , we only briefly comment that near future observations by meter waves telescopes such as giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ; swarup 1984 ) and the kilometer square array interferometer ( skai ; braun 1995 ) and the next generation infrared telescopes such as the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ; werner & eisenhardt 1988 ) and next generation space telescope ( ngst ) will shed light on the properties of objects at the reionization epoch such as neutral hydrogen condensates ( scott & rees 1990 ; subramanian & padmanabhan 1993 ; madau , meiksin , & rees 1997 ) and ionizing sources ( haiman & loeb 1997 ; miralda - escud & rees 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , the differences in the reionization time thus in optical depth to cmb photon and in angular scales would leave different imprints on cmb at small angular scales .      needless to say ,",
    "future cmb experiments are likely to provide a very rich amount of information , that can be used in many aspects to constrain cosmological models as well as understanding astrophysical processes involved",
    ". however , cosmological parameters determined from cmb experiments alone are likely to display certain degeneracies ( e.g. , efstathiou & bond 1998 ) .",
    "other astronomical and cosmological phenomena discussed in the preceding sections are , in this sense , complementary to cmb observations . here",
    "we choose to focus on one parameter , which is cosmologically important but is not tangled with other complicated processes such as recombination and reionization processes , namely , the primordial power index @xmath2 .",
    "another reason for favoring the choice of @xmath2 is that @xmath2 is distinctly different between models and perhaps offers one of cleanest tests of models .",
    "the underlying reason that different models have distinctly different @xmath2 is a product of combined effort : combining cmb ( cobe ) with local cluster observations . it is clearly seen from table 1 that normalizing a model both to very large scale ( cobe ) and cluster scale results in a tight constraint on the primordial power spectrum index @xmath2 .",
    "however , currently cobe does not provide strong constraint on @xmath2 due to its large errorbars [ @xmath315 ( @xmath56 ) ] . in the foreseeable future",
    "there are two satellite missions , map and planck , which are proposed to produce much higher resolution ( arminute to sub - degree versus @xmath316 of cobe ) and much more sensitive cmb temperature fluctuation measurements .",
    "we summarize the model results on @xmath2 in figure 15 .",
    "the ranges in @xmath2 are @xmath56 . also shown",
    "are the @xmath56 errorbars that map and planck are thought to be able to achieve ( zaldarriaga , spergel , & seljak 1997 ) .",
    "note that the horizontal locations of map and planck indicators are arbitrary .",
    "it is seen that map will be able to provide a powerful discriminator between the models , whereas planck should be able to constrain @xmath2 thus test models with exquisite precision .",
    "when models are normalized to both cobe on very large scales and clusters of galaxies on intermediate - to - large scales , they naturally have grossly similar properties of clusters of galaxies at zero redshift",
    ". other local tests surrounding clusters regions or weighted heavily by clusters are unlikely to be very sensitive for the purpose of differentiating between models . among such tests are galaxy - galaxy pairwise velocity dispersion ( e.g. , @xcite ; strauss , ostriker , & cen 1998 ) , galaxy - galaxy two point correlation function ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and large - scale velocity flows in the local universe ( e.g. , strauss 1995 ) .",
    "although it is conceivable that fine details within the clusters at zero redshift may differ among different models , such as cluster morphology , substructure etc .",
    "( richstone , loeb , & turner 1992 ; @xcite ; see cen 1997b for a somewhat more realistic view on this considering some unavoidable projection effects ) , it is likely that more significant differences between the models will come from regions far removed from local clusters of galaxies .",
    "there are two ways to be distant from clusters .",
    "first , one can move to regions such filaments or voids in the local universe which are spatially distant from the clusters .",
    "there is no doubt that there are significant differences in the properties of these regions among different models .",
    "but detailed modeling of such regions , in particular , voids , is extremely difficult due to the lack of appropriate small scale resolution in such regions even with the best simulations available .",
    "we have followed on the second route in this paper by traveling back in time away from the local universe and studied the properties of model universes at moderate - to - high redshift through a suite of cosmological phenomena .",
    "in addition to a consideration of galaxy power spectrum from sdss galaxy redshift survey (  3.2 ) , which is shown to be capable of differentiating between models , we have examined eight phenomena ranging in redshift from zero to that of last scattering .",
    "they include the correlation function of very rich clusters of galaxies (  3.1 ) , the evolution of the abundance of rich clusters of galaxies (  3.3 ) , the gravitational lensing by moderate redshift clusters of galaxies (  3.4 ) , the properties of @xmath1 forest at high redshift (  3.5 ) , the damped @xmath1 systems at high redshift (  3.6 ) , the high redshift galaxies (  3.7 ) , the reionization epoch of the universe (  3.8 ) and the future high resolution , high sensitivity cmb experiments (  3.9 ) .",
    "some of these observations have already provided discriminating tests between some models .",
    "for example , hcdm model is strongly ruled out by the observed large density of neutral hydrogens in damped @xmath1 systems and possibly inconsistent with observations of @xmath1 clouds .",
    "both @xmath37 tcdm and hcdm models are in disagreement with the observed abundance of rich clusters of galaxies at @xmath317 and the observed strong clustering of high redshift galaxies at @xmath209 , while other , low density models are in fair agreement with those observations .",
    "we find that all these moderate - to - high redshift phenomena possess potentially very powerful capabilities of differentiating between all the remaining  viable \" models .",
    "we now discuss the requisite condition for each phenomenon to be capable of providing some useful constraint .",
    "it is found that different models differ most for correlations of very rich clusters of galaxies , those with mean separation @xmath318mpc .",
    "let us take the data point shown as a solid dot in figure 3 as an example to quantify this .",
    "if the errorbar were @xmath319mpc ( @xmath115 ) ( with the mean value unchanged ) , all the models may be ruled out at @xmath320 confidence level .",
    "is this achievable ?",
    "the answer is a probable yes with sdss .",
    "let us assume that the correlation function is a powerlaw with a slope of @xmath321 .",
    "then , the mean correlation function has a value @xmath322 at @xmath323 ( where the correlation function has a value unity ) . in order to achieve a statistical errorbar of @xmath319mpc for @xmath324mpc ,",
    "@xmath325 pairs of clusters are necessary .",
    "since @xmath326 at @xmath323 , we get @xmath327mpc@xmath328 [ @xmath329mpc@xmath330 is assumed ] .",
    "the sdss survey volume is about @xmath331mpc@xmath328 .",
    "so it seems that clusters from sdss will provide an unprecedented accuracy for the determination of cluster correlations of very rich clusters .",
    "the evolution rates of the abundances of rich clusters of galaxies in different models are quite different and differences of the abundances of clusters increasingly deviate from one another towards high redshift ( figure 7 ) .",
    "as shown earlier , even the currently available very small data set is already able to differentiate the @xmath3 models ( tcdm , hcdm ) from the rest .",
    "however , larger cluster samples will be required to constrain @xmath3 to a high accuracy .",
    "as shown  3.3 , a high redshift x - ray cluster survey covering a quarter of the sky with enough sensitivity to measure the temperature of hot luminous clusters ( @xmath332kev ) at @xmath333 will be able to determine @xmath3 with an uncertainty of @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) , if @xmath116 , and @xmath119 , if @xmath158 .",
    "these accuracies are comparable to those which will be determined from the next generation microwave background fluctuation experiments ( e.g. , zaldarriaga , spergel , & seljak 1997 ) , thus provides a very powerful cosmological test and also a very important consistency cross - check .",
    "the gravitational lensing optical depths for large splittings or giant arcs due to moderate - to - high redshift clusters of galaxies increasingly differ towards high redshift between models .",
    "while this is closely related to the evolution of abundance of rich clusters , the differences between different models tend to be larger and more extreme because of the highly nonlinear dependence of gravitational lensing cross section on cluster mass . for background sources at @xmath334",
    ", the primary differences occur between models with different @xmath3 ; models with a same @xmath3 but with and without a cosmological constant give comparable results ( figure 9a ) . for background sources at @xmath209 ,",
    "all the models become non - degenerate ( figure 9b )",
    ". a systematic search of about @xmath177 background sources at @xmath335 will be desirable .",
    "in fact , sdss should provide such a sample ( @xmath336 quasars mostly at high redshift with photometric redshifts and @xmath337 quasars with spectroscopic redshifts , margon 1998 ) .",
    "one can use such a sample in two ways .",
    "firstly , the total number of lensed sources will be different between the models . with @xmath177 quasars ( assuming to be at @xmath172 for this simple illustration )",
    ", one should see ( @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 ) multiple - image quasars with separation @xmath184 in ( ocdm25 , ocdm40 , @xmath30cdm25 , @xmath30cdm40 , tcdm , hcdm ) , respectively .",
    "this would allow an unambiguous test of these six models .",
    "it would put a constraint on @xmath3 with @xmath186 if the universe is open or @xmath187 if the universe is flat . secondly , and more sensitively",
    ", the distributions of lenses themselves in different models will be very different .",
    "for example , one expect to see ( 200.0 , 4.0 , 0.5 , 0.005 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) lenses at @xmath338 in ( ocdm25 , ocdm40 , @xmath30cdm25 , @xmath30cdm40 , tcdm , hcdm ) , respectively , that produce arcs or splittings @xmath184 .",
    "the properties of @xmath1 forest at high redshift are likely to be dramatically different among the models given the order of magnitude different powers on the relevant scales . with regard to this , observations are perhaps slightly ahead of theory ; there is a large and still rapidly accumulating observational database for @xmath1 forest .",
    "but detailed hydrodynamic simulations of @xmath1 forest , while having made ground - breaking advances in our understanding of @xmath1 forest phenomenon in recent years , are yet to sort out the fine dependence of results on such issues as variations among different hydrocodes , resolution and boxsize effect , radiative transfer effect and star formation feedback effects , before they can be utilized to test cosmological models in accurate ( thus meaningful ) ways .",
    "preliminary comparisons between models and observations using the one - point flux distribution probability function ( rauch 1997 ) favor the two @xmath30 based models ( @xmath30cdm25 and @xmath30cdm40 ) , but disfavor hcdm and ocdm25 in the opposite sense that hcdm has too little power and ocdm25 has too much power on the relevant scales .",
    "tcdm and ocdm40 appear to be marginally consistent .",
    "the neutral hydrogen mass in damped @xmath1 systems at high redshift is undoubtedly a very sensitive test .",
    "their role is comparable to that of rich clusters today in the sense that damped @xmath1 systems are rare systems at the high redshift .",
    "four improvements will dramatically enhance its discriminatory power .",
    "first , more detailed kinematic studies of these systems , at the highest redshift possible , are indispensable to providing more tight limits on the mass of these systems .",
    "second , a significant reduction of observational errorbars with more samples can significantly increase the sensitivity of the test .",
    "sdss should provide a much larger quasar sample .",
    "third , it is beneficial to go to higher redshift to further increase its sensitivity of testing cosmological models . finally , detailed modeling of these systems is necessary in order to determine the precise amount of gas in neutral form .",
    "for this we will have to implement detailed three - dimensional radiative transfer in the existing hydrocodes , run large simulation boxes ( @xmath339mpc ) to ensure a fair sample and have a better understanding of the star formation processes in these systems .",
    "the abundance and clustering of high redshift galaxies at @xmath209 has been shown to differ among models .",
    "these are the large proto - clusters or proto - superclusters that eventually produce the clusters and superclusters of galaxies that we see today .",
    "the issue here is to enlarge the observational sample size .",
    "if the observed galaxy concentration seen by s98 turns out to be ubiquitous , all the models considered would be in a very uncomfortable position .",
    "with about ten fields like ssa22 , preferably randomly distributed spatially , we may be able to reject some models with high confidence levels .",
    "a perhaps more discriminatory test with the high redshift galaxies is from measuring the velocity dispersion ( or mass ) of these galaxies .",
    "if the high redshift galaxies are as massive as the present day @xmath340 galaxies , as present preliminary observational evidence indicates ( steidel 1996 ) , all @xmath37 models are inviable .",
    "the reionization epoch of the universal baryons is shown to be substantially different among the models .",
    "it is very worthwhile to search for quasars at as high redshift as possible .",
    "for example , if quasars can be seen beyond @xmath313 , hcdm will be inviable ; if quasars can be seen beyond @xmath314 , only low density open models could pass .",
    "next generation infrared telescopes such as sirtf and ngst and next generation radio telescopes such as gmrt and skai will prove to be extremely useful to not only test the models but also understand the detailed history of the reionization .",

    "one critical test will be an unambiguous determination of the primordial power index .",
    "accurate determinations by map and planck will provide strong constraints on @xmath3 .",

    "<S> the cobe microwave background temperature fluctuations and the abundance of local rich clusters of galaxies provide the two most powerful constraints on cosmological models . when all variants of the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) model are subject to the combined constraint , the power spectrum of any model is fixed to @xmath0 accuracy in both the shape and overall amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> these constrained models are not expected to differ dramatically in their local large - scale structure properties . however , their evolutionary histories differ , resulting in dramatic differences towards high redshift . in particular , it should be true that any statistical measure that probes a rapidly diminishing tail of some distribution should provide a sensitive test at some sufficiently high redshift , when the objects in question are rare and hence in the tail .    </S>",
    "<S> we examine in detail six standardized , cobe and cluster normalized cdm models with respect to a large set of independent observations . </S>",
    "<S> the observations include correlation function of rich clusters of galaxies , galaxy power spectrum , evolution of rich cluster abundance , gravitational lensing by moderate - to - high redshift clusters , @xmath1 forest , damped @xmath1 systems , high redshift galaxies , reionization of the universe and future cmb experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that each of the independent observations examined is or potentially is capable of distinguishing between at least some of the models . </S>",
    "<S> the combined power of several or all of these observations is tremendous . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we appear to be on the verge of being able to make dramatic tests of all models in the near future using a rapidly growing set of observations , mostly at moderate to high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> consistency or inconsistency between different observed phenomena on different scales and/or at different epochs with respect to the models will have profound implications for theory of growth of cosmic structure .    </S>",
