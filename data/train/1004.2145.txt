    "broad absorption line quasars ( balqsos ) as their name suggests , show strong broad blue - shifted absorption lines in their spectra believed to be indicative of high velocity ( @xmath10.1c ) out - flowing winds .",
    "balqsos represent approximately 15% of quasars in general @xcite .",
    "the majority ( @xmath1 85% ) @xcite of balqsos are known as hibals , displaying absorption in lines of high ionisation only ( e.g. n  v , si  iv , and c  iv ) .",
    "the remainder are classified as lobals and show in addition broad absorption in lines of low ionisation species , most notably al  iii and mg  ii .",
    "lobals are further sub - classified according to the presence of fe absorption , the fe  lobals .",
    "since the spectra of lobals are in general redder than hibals , @xcite suggests that balqsos and in particular fe  lobals may be an early phase in the development of emerging or re - fuelled quasars .",
    "there has been much debate about the relationship between balqsos and the general quasar population as a whole .",
    "simple unification schemes , suggest that balqsos and non - balqsos are similar objects and that any observed differences in their spectra arise due to orientation effects @xcite . in this picture",
    ", the relative fraction of balqsos to non - balqsos has a simple geometric interpretation , representing the fraction of sky , as seen from the source , obscured by gas ( ie .",
    "the source covering fraction ) , which in the simplest case , can be related to the flow geometry ( e.g. opening angle ) .    in recent years interest in balqsos outflows has risen sharply , principally because of the realisation that such high velocity outflows carry a substantial amount of energy and momentum into the ism , and may therefore be important in driving agn feedback as well as providing a mechanism for quenching star formation @xcite . indeed , the discovery of highly ionised , very high - velocity x - ray outflows ( e.g. pounds et  al",
    ". 2003a , 2003b ; pounds and reeves 2009 ) , for which the energy transport ( in terms of mechanical energy ) is large enough to interrupt the growth of the host galaxy , may provide the causal link behind the well - known correlation between the mass of the central black hole and the mass of the bulge ( e.g. ferrarese and merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et  al .",
    "2000 ; tremaine et  al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "however , despite the increasing importance of these outflows the precise mechanism responsible for accelerating them to high velocity remains uncertain , with radiative acceleration @xcite , magneto hydro dynamic ( mhd ) driven winds @xcite and thermally driven winds seen as the main contenders ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "a major hindrance to progress in this area is the absence of a clean discriminatory observational signature of what are essentially orthogonal wind geometries . for radio - quiet objects ,",
    "agn unification schemes tend to favour equatorial wind geometries ( e.g. elvis 2000 ) .",
    "by contrast , observations of radio - loud balqsos @xcite and in particular polarisation observations of pks  0040 - 005 indicate a non - equatorial bal outflow @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for the apparent difference in wind geometry between radio - loud and radio - quiet objects , is that different acceleration mechanisms operate in these two classes of objects .",
    "perhaps the strongest indicator that radiative driving is responsible for accelerating at least some of the high velocity flows , is the appearance of line - locking features in the spectra of a small fraction of bal quasars ( e.g. turnshek et  al .",
    "1988 , weymann et  al .",
    "1991 , korista et  al .",
    "1993 , arav 1996 , vilkoviskij and irwin 2001 ) .",
    "the most well - studied of these is the so - called ghost of ly-@xmath0 , a small hump seen in the absorption troughs of a small fraction ( less than a few percent ) of balqsos formed via the interaction between ly-@xmath0 photons and n  v ions ( see e.g. korista et  al .",
    "1993 , arav et  al .",
    "1995 , arav 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , the reality of ghosts remains very much an open question .",
    "previous studies have been limited to small samples of relatively low quality spectra , with strong ghosts often only becoming apparent in composite spectra ( arav et  al .",
    "1995 , north et  al .",
    "moreover , distinguishing between line - locking features and similar features caused by the chance alignment of multiple absorption systems is difficult with relatively small samples . indeed , korista et  al .",
    "1993 , showed that in a sample 72 objects , evidence for line - locking features was merely suggestive rather than convincing .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold : ( i ) to compile the largest sample of uniformly selected ghost - candidate spectra , and ( ii ) attempt to determine the origin of their ghost features , by testing on a source by source basis , whether they meet the original criteria as set out by arav ( 1995 ) necessary for ghost - features to be observed . in ",
    "2 we describe the mechanism proposed for ghost formation and outline arav s criteria for the production of strong ghost signatures .",
    "selection of those objects comprising our ghost - candidate spectra and our non - ghost control sample is described in  3 . in ",
    "4 we present the results of testing each of the spectra in our ghost - candidate and comparison samples against each of the criteria in turn necessary for the formation of an observable ghost feature .",
    "we discuss the implications of our findings in  5 .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in  6 .",
    "the feature that is poetically known as the ghost of ly-@xmath0 is a hump seen in the absorption trough of a small fraction ( less than 5% , arav 1995 , north et  al .",
    "2006 ) of balqsos located 5900  km  s@xmath2 blue - ward of the centre of the line to which the absorption is attributed .",
    "the feature was first investigated by @xcite after being seen in a difference spectrum of balqso and non - balqso spectral composites produced by @xcite who pointed out that the difference between the two absorption troughs was approximately equal to the velocity separation of n  v and ly-@xmath0 . in a series of papers in the mid 90 s @xcite arav",
    "suggested that the feature seen at this velocity was a result of the increased radiative pressure on n  v ions at this velocity within the outflow . in this picture",
    "n  v ions moving at 5900  km  s@xmath2 see the ly-@xmath0 emission from the agn at the energy of their own emission resulting in a large increase in the scattering cross section of the ly-@xmath0 photons .",
    "consequently , out - flowing n  v ions receive an increase in radiation pressure leading to a large injection of momentum into the outflow .",
    "the out - flowing ions of other species are dragged to higher velocities by electromagnetic interactions with the n  v ions , leading to a deficit of material at this velocity ( because each out - flowing ion spends very little time at this velocity before being accelerated to greater velocities ) . in turn",
    "this causes a decrease in the opacity at this velocity which manifests as a peak within the absorption troughs of the out - flowing species .",
    "this simple mechanism explains both the presence of the feature and why it s position is linked to the rest frame of the source .",
    "@xcite where the separation of the troughs is constant but their velocities are determined by the velocity of the first trough . ]",
    "@xcite suggested that the reason for the feature being most prominent in c  iv absorption rather than in other species , is that the doublet separation of c  iv is far smaller ( 498  km  s@xmath2 ) . by comparison the larger doublet separations of si  iv ( 1933  km  s@xmath2 ) and o  vi ( 1647  km  s@xmath2 )",
    "result in the feature being blurred over several thousand km  s@xmath2 , producing a low contrast feature which is difficult to detect in low s / n data .",
    "for this reason , in this study we confine our search for ghost features to the c  iv broad absorption line only .",
    "since ly-@xmath0 and n  v are amongst the strongest uv lines in agn spectra , an obvious question to ask is why are nt ghost - features ubiquitous amongst the general balqso population ? to answer this , arav proposed a set of physically motivated criteria which had to be met before ghost features would be observable .",
    "these are :    1 .",
    "significant broad absorption in the region between 3000 and 9000  km  s@xmath2 blue - ward of line centre , 2 .",
    "strong intrinsic ly-@xmath0 emission , 3 .",
    "narrow ly-@xmath0 emission , 4 .",
    "strong broad n  v absorption , 5",
    ".   little far - uv flux between between @xmath3200  and @xmath31000 .",
    "the first criterion is simply a statement that ghost - features can only be observed if significant photon scattering is occurring .",
    "the second criterion implies that there must be a significant flux of ly-@xmath0 photons , while the third requires that the line - emitting gas has a relatively narrow spread in velocities so that the resulting feature is not spread over a large range of velocity reducing the contrast .",
    "since the dominant scattering ion is n  v , strong n  v absorption is also needed . the final requirement , and the most difficult to measure , recognises that in order for ly-@xmath0n  v line - locking to dominate the dynamics of the flow , there can not be significant far - uv line driving ( korista et  al . 1993 ) .",
    "balqsos represent @xmath115% of the quasar population ( see e.g. knigge et  al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) , of these , between @xmath120 - 25% show evidence for multiple troughs @xcite . amongst the multi - trough objects ,",
    "ghost candidates are likely rare representing less than a few per cent of balqsos ( arav 1995 ) because of the stringent requirements for ghost observability .",
    "thus in order to find significant numbers of ghost - candidates , large quasar samples are required .",
    "all previous ghost candidate samples have been limited to just a handful of objects @xcite . by comparison ,",
    "data release 5 ( dr5 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) contains 77,429 quasars of which 28,421 have redshifts between 1.7 and 4.2 allowing c  iv and any associated absorption to be seen in their optical spectra .",
    "we require a visible c  iv bal because although radiative line driving will produce a feature in all absorption troughs , the resultant hump will be most easily observed in the c  iv absorption trough because of the small doublet separation of this line .",
    "several balqso samples have been compiled from the various data releases of the sdss @xcite and from dr5 @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the balqso catalogue of @xcite , containing 3,552 balqsos .",
    "the scaringi et  al .",
    "sample , differs from other samples in that is does not rely on simple metrics such as the balnicity index ( bi , weymann et  al .",
    "1991 ) or absorption index ( ai , hall et  al .",
    "2002 , trump et  al .",
    "2006 ) to identify and classify balqsos .",
    "rather it uses a robust hybrid method , involving gross classification with a supervised neural network ( learning vector quantisation ) and the visual inspection of outliers .    to identify strong ghost candidates we have performed five cuts on this balqso sample .",
    "the first cut eliminates noisy spectra ( s / n@xmath44 per pixel ) , estimated in two line - free continuum bands from @xmath516501700 and @xmath517001750 . to reduce contamination from emission , absorption and cosmic rays that may be present in either bin we take the greater of the two values as our s / n estimate .",
    "the second cut removes all objects which show an apparently single smooth absorption trough . following this cut",
    "we are left with only those objects which display multiple absorption trough features ( 1019 in total ) .",
    "a third rejection cut removes those objects that contain 2 or more peaks within the absorption trough ( numbering 761 ) .",
    "these objects are eliminated to reduce contamination by objects which display absorption from multiple out - flowing regions which by chance happen to lie at velocities corresponding to the ghost - zone .",
    "this leaves just 258 objects which contain a single - peak ( or alternatively double - trough ) within the c  iv absorption region .",
    "figure  [ fig : mt ] ( upper panel ) shows our multi - trough composite spectrum ( solid line ) created from taking the geometric mean of all objects rejected at this stage after normalising the flux between @xmath517001750 to unity . in order to highlight the absorption regions",
    ", we also plot a non - balqso composite spectrum ( dashed line ) .",
    "the non - balqso composite is the geometric mean of all of the quasar spectra in the sdss dr5 quasar catalogue in the redshift range 1.7@xmath4z@xmath44.2 excluding those objects which are also in the balqso catalogue of scaringi et  al . , and reddened to fit to the continuum windows in the multi - trough composite spectrum using the smc extinction law of @xcite . for completeness",
    ", the middle and lower panels show two example spectra rejected at his stage .",
    "we note that our multi - trough composite spectrum [ fig : mt ] shows no evidence for coherent structure within the c  iv trough .",
    "this suggests that the positions of the various absorption systems in the individual spectra are in general uncorrelated , that is they do not contain a large number of ghost candidates that happen to show additional peaks within the absorption .",
    "this is consistent with the hypothesis that these multiple - trough spectra are the result of multiple unconnected absorbing systems .",
    "for the 258 objects which show a single peak in their c  iv absorption we make a further cut to remove those objects ( 189 ) which show peaks outside of the ghost - zone as defined by @xcite .",
    "the ghost zone edges are 5900  km  s@xmath2 blue - ward of the peaks of the doublet of the emission line in question ( in this work c  iv ) this zone is then expanded to take into account redshift errors by multiplying these boundaries by 1@xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the median redshift of our sample ( @xmath82.14 ) , and @xmath9 is the average redshift error ( @xmath100.01 ) .",
    "this results in a ghost zone extending between @xmath31513.2     and @xmath31525.4     for c  iv .",
    "our single - peak composite comprising 189 objects whose peak lies outside of the ghost - zone is shown in figure  [ fig : sp ] ( upper panel , solid line ) .",
    "the middle and lower panels show example spectra of objects rejected at this stage .",
    "each object shows a clear peak located just outside of the limits of the ghost zone .",
    "interestingly , this composite spectrum shows some evidence of a feature at the low velocity edge of the ghost zone .",
    "one possible explanation for this feature is that these objects are genuine ghost - candidates with poorly assigned redshifts .",
    "however , on closer inspection of the objects rejected at this stage we find no evidence for features outside of the ghost zone due to random redshift errors .",
    "alternative explanations for the origin of this feature include , ( i ) intrinsically weaker absorption at lower velocities , or ( ii ) an abrupt change in the intensity of the ( overlying ) emission at these velocities .",
    "we make one further cut to remove those objects which do not show significant broad absorption either side of the ghost feature extending from 3000 to 9000  km  s@xmath2 blue - ward of the emission - line .",
    "this cut is chosen to eliminate objects with deep narrow absorption features whose alignment mimics the presence of a ghost feature .",
    "figure  [ fig : gzr ] ( upper panel , solid line ) displays the composite spectrum of all objects rejected at this stage , while in the middle and lower panels , we give examples of individual objects rejected by this cut . though the composite spectrum shows a clear feature within the ghost zone , it is not smooth , instead displaying sharp narrow features , whose separation is larger than the doublet separation of c  iv .",
    "this reflects both the narrowness of the absorption features ( since intrinsically broad humps would be smoothed out in the averaging process yielding low contrast features ) which make up this composite , and in addition small differences in their velocities relative to the rest - frame of the source . these differences may result from these features being unrelated to the ghost mechanism and appearing in the ghost zone by chance though we can not preclude the fact that some of the objects rejected at this stage are indeed true ghost - candidates .",
    "our final sample of 43 ghost - candidate objects comprises the largest sample of objects exhibiting the ghost of ly-@xmath0 and the first to allow a statistical analysis of the properties of these objects .",
    "figure  [ fig : gz ] shows the geometric mean composite ghost - candidate spectrum ( solid line ) , together with a non - balqso composite spectrum ( dashed line ) , and two example ghost - candidate spectra ( middle and lower panels ) .",
    "our final ghost - candidate composite spectrum displays a clear smooth double - trough structure located firmly within the ghost zone of a relatively broad absorption trough",
    ". visual comparison of this composite with that formed from objects rejected at the previous stage ( i.e. those with insufficient absorption either side of the ghost - zone ) , indicates that our final sample displays on average narrower ly-@xmath0 and c  iv emission - lines , stronger ly-@xmath0 emission and deeper",
    "n  v absorption ( fulfilling 3 of arav s criteria for forming observable ghost features ) , as well as broader si  iv absorption , and suggests that we are indeed isolating those objects most likely to form observable ghost features . figure  [ fig : ghostflow ] summarises the various cuts made in the creation of our ghost - candidate sample .      of the 43 strong ghost - candidates , 21 are at large enough redshift @xmath11 to place ly-@xmath0 above the atmospheric cut - off and",
    "thus allow us to test for each object all of the criteria deemed necessary for ghost - formation .",
    "these are listed in the upper half of table  1 . for the remainder ,",
    "their redshifts are too low to allow a direct measurement of the strength and width of the ly-@xmath0 emission - line . for these objects",

    "in order to create such a sample we have performed a number of cuts on the @xcite balqso sample . as for our ghost - candidate sample",
    "we first select for s / n@xmath124 , and then select those objects with @xmath13 to allow inspection of the n  v and ly-@xmath0 emission - lines necessary to test for the presence of strong narrow ly-@xmath0 emission and strong n   v absorption .",
    "the remaining spectra are then visually inspected and any object showing multiple absorption troughs or any other hint of a ghost feature are removed from the sample .",
    "we also remove those objects which do not show significant absorption between 3000 and 9000  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this leaves just 26 objects showing significant c  iv absorption between 3000 and 9000  km  s@xmath2 with no evidence for a ghost feature or multiple trough .",
    "one of these objects sdss j101056.68 + 355833.3 shows evidence for a ghost feature in the si  iv absorption line ( see a5 ) and is therefore also removed from our comparison sample leaving just 25 objects .",
    "a summary of the rejection cuts made in the creation of our comparison sample is given in figure  [ fig : comparison_flow ] .",
    "the geometric mean composite spectrum of our comparison sample is indicated by the dotted line in figure  7 . aside from substantially weaker n  v absorption , the strengths and widths of the emission - lines in the comparison sample composite spectrum match those of the ghost candidate composite spectrum remarkably well .",
    "the main difference between these two composite spectra appears to be the absence of the low - velocity absorption trough in the comparison sample spectrum .",
    "we do not believe this difference arises from the way in which the two samples were selected .",
    "in  4 we use our ghost - candidate sample to test , where possible , the criteria set out by @xcite required by radiative acceleration models to produce an observable ghost feature .",
    "we compare the relative frequency by which our ghost candidate spectra meet the criteria necessary for the formation of observable ghost features with our non - ghost comparison sample .",
    "in this section we present the results of testing the criteria for the formation of observable ghost features .",
    "we first concentrate on the sample of 21 ghost - candidate objects for which all of the criteria may be tested and compare these results with those obtained using our non - ghost comparison sample .",
    "we then move on to our remaining objects and test where possible whether these objects satisfy the necessary criteria .",
    "all of the objects in our ghost candidate sample will clearly show significant absorption in the region between 3000 and 9000  km  s@xmath2 blue - ward of the c  iv emission line as this is required in order to see any potential ghost feature .",
    "this criterion is required purely because in order to effect the out - flowing c  iv ions in an observable way this outflow must reach significant optical depth and appear as a bal trough within the spectrum .",
    "our comparison sample has also been chosen to exhibit strong broad absorption , so naturally also fulfils this criterion .",
    "( solid line ) , ( ii ) 25 bals with featureless broad absorption troughs ( dotted line ) , and ( iii ) non - balqsos from the dr5 qso catalogue ( dashed line).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in order for the effects of ly-@xmath0 radiation on n  v to cause a significant increase in the radiation pressure on the outflow as a whole the ly-@xmath0 emission line must be intrinsically strong .",
    "however , since the ghost of ly-@xmath0 is produced by scattering ly-@xmath0 photons it can be extremely difficult to measure the strength of the intrinsic ly-@xmath0 emission - line .",
    "hence @xcite modified this criterion to allow the c  iv and n  v emission - lines to be used in situations where the ly-@xmath0 emission - line was either significantly absorbed , or had insufficient spectral coverage .",
    "this modified criterion requires ly-@xmath0 emission to be at least 300% above the continuum and/or both c  iv and n  v to be at least 100% above the continuum and n  v emission - lines to be similarly narrow . ] .",
    "they note that ` the latter criterion is hardly ideal but observations of non - bal quasars show that the line strengths roughly scale together ' ( arav et  al .",
    "1995 ) . here",
    "we isolate the continuum emission using the specfit package in iraf .",
    "we model the continuum as a reddened power law and fit to the continuum in regions free of contaminating emission- and absorption- lines , where possible",
    ". this can be particularly difficult for objects with the highest velocity out - flows as there are few emission / absorption line - free regions .",
    "furthermore , we have not attempted to fit for the continuum short - ward of @xmath31280 as this region is typically so absorbed and the line - emission so highly blended that no clean continuum regions can be identified .",
    "instead , we fix the continuum strength at short wavelengths to that measured between @xmath513151350 .",
    "this approach is chosen to avoid overestimating the strength of the broad absorption , at the expense of overestimating the strength of the line - emission in a few cases .    in objects",
    "whose spectra cover the ly-@xmath0 region , 86% ( 18/21 ) of the ghost candidate sample meet the criterion for strong emission - lines compared to 88% ( 22/25 ) of the comparison sample .",
    "inspection of the composite spectra for the two samples ( figure  [ fig : comp_samples ] ) , indicates that the strength of the ly-@xmath0 emission - line ( relative to the continuum ) is broadly similar in the two samples , and both are weaker relative to the non - balqso composite , due to the presence of strong n  v and ly-@xmath0 absorption . for the other lines ,",
    "the n  v emission - line appears stronger on average in our ghost - candidate and comparison samples relative to non - balqsos , while there appears little difference in the strength of the c  iv emission - line , though we note that in so far as we can measure them , their emission - line widths appear to be narrower on average .",
    "models of outflows accelerated by radiative line driving produced by @xcite suggest that once the line widths exceed 3500  km  s@xmath2 ( fwhm ) potential ghost features become undetectable .",
    "this is because broader emission - lines will result in a broader , lower contrast feature ( since the core of the line , where most of the scattering occurs , is weaker relative to the wings in a broad emission - line c.f a narrow emission - line ) which is difficult to detect particularly in low s / n data .",
    "unfortunately , determining the width of the underlying emission - lines in balqsos is extremely difficult as the broad absorption in these objects prevents accurate measurements of the shape and strength of the underlying emission - lines and continuum . given how our ghost - candidate sample was selected",
    "we expect all of the ghost - candidates to show significant absorption in the blue wing of ly-@xmath0 , n  v and c  iv , while our comparison sample was chosen to exhibit strong relatively featureless absorption in the blue wing of c  iv .",
    "since we can not make an accurate measurement of the width of the ly-@xmath0 emission - line we instead attempt to estimate its likely width using the c  iv emission - line width as a surrogate . for the majority of sources , c  iv is severely absorbed , so we estimate its underlying un - absorbed width using model fits to the red wing of the emission - line .",
    "we use the same underlying fit for the continuum as was used to measure the emission - line strength (  4.2 ) .",
    "we fit the red - wing with a two - component model , a gaussian core and lorentzian wings , with the central wavelengths fixed together but allowed to vary slightly from the rest wavelength of c  iv .",
    "we allow the strength and width of the two components to vary independently and fit to the red - wing taking care to avoid those regions of the spectrum contaminated by broad he  ii  @xmath31640 and [ o  iii ]  @xmath31663  emission . the measured width is taken to be the fwhm of the composite fit .",
    "if the measured fwhm@xmath43500  km  s@xmath2 , then the object meets the criterion for the formation of an observable ghost feature .    for our 21 ghost - candidates with z@xmath122.15 , only 12 ( 57% )",
    "have fwhm ( c  iv ) @xmath4  3500  km  s@xmath2 . in the remainder ,",
    "those for which the c  iv width can actually be measured ( 17 objects ) , 8/17 ( 47% ) also meet this criterion .",
    "this fraction is similar to that found for our comparison sample where 12 out of the 20 objects ( 60% ) for which c  iv width measurements can be made , also meet this criterion ( see table  2 for details ) .",
    "taking the average of all of the fwhm measured for the ghost candidates gives an average fwhm of 3345@xmath14842  km  s@xmath2 which is similar to the upper limit proposed by @xcite and to the average fwhm of c  iv found for the comparison sample ( 3534@xmath141160  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "a k - s test on these populations shows no significant difference between the ghost and comparison samples .",
    "the difficulty in fitting the c  iv line in many of these objects results in large uncertainties in the estimated widths , however it is clear that several of our ghost candidates have emission that is wider than the 3500  km  s@xmath2 upper limit proposed by @xcite .",
    "there are a number of possible explanations for this .",
    "firstly , c  iv may be a relatively poor surrogate for the width of ly-@xmath0 .",
    "alternatively , our sample may suffer from contamination by objects in which the potential ghost feature is produced by a chance alignment of multiple absorption systems or through other mechanisms unrelated to radiative acceleration .",
    "if the potential ghost - features are indeed due to line - locking , then it may in - fact be possible to produce an observable ghost feature from emission - lines with widths in excess of 3500  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "as described in  2 , the ghost feature is produced by the increased radiation pressure on out - flowing n  v ions by ly-@xmath0 photons . since in this model",
    "the n  v ions scatter a significant fraction of the incident flux , strong n  v absorption is a pre - requisite .    in order to measure",
    "the strength of absorption due to n  v we use a modified balnicity index ( weymann 1991 ) .",
    "we take the continuum to be equal to the mean flux between @xmath513151330 , and require that the flux drops to below 90% of this value continuously for @xmath15  km  s@xmath2 between 0 and 7000  km  s@xmath2 blue - ward of the n  v emission line .",
    "we use the 7000  km  s@xmath2 limit to avoid contamination by absorption due to ly-@xmath0 . any object with a non - zero value for this measure",
    "is considered to show strong n  v broad absorption .",
    "significant n  v absorption is measured in all 21 objects from our ghost candidate sample whose redshift allows detection of n  v absorption .",
    "only 44% ( 11/25 ) of our comparison sample satisfy this criterion .",
    "the geometric composites of figure  7 , confirm that our ghost - candidate sample displays significantly stronger n  v absorption on average than our comparison sample .",
    "moreover , the broadly similar n  v emission - line strengths of the ghost - candidate and comparison sample , emphasises the increased importance of n  v absorption in the ghost - candidate spectra .",
    "photo - ionisation models suggest that the far uv spectra of quasars contain a significant number of emission - lines between @xmath3200 and @xmath31000 that will contribute to the radiation pressure on any bal outflow ( korista et  al .",
    "1993 ) . in order for a ghost feature to be observed the radiation pressure of ly-@xmath0 on the n  v ions in the outflow must be at least comparable in strength to the radiation pressure on all other ions in the outflow . this led arav to suggest that the far - uv continuum must therefore be necessarily weak in objects showing ghost features .",
    "absorption of far - uv photons both within the host galaxy as well as within our own galaxy preclude direct measurement of the far - uv continuum .",
    "however @xcite note that the strength of the he  ii  @xmath16",
    "  emission - line can be used as a surrogate for the far - uv ionising continuum .",
    "a strong he  ii line suggests a similarly strong far - uv flux and vice - versa as this line is produced by photons with energies corresponding to @xmath3228(@xmath1754  ev ) .",
    "however , the he  ii emission - line strength is notoriously difficult to measure even in high quality spectra .",
    "this is because of its close proximity to the [ o  iii]@xmath31663 emission - line , as well as its location near the red - wing of c  iv , which may extend to relatively high velocities . thus isolating the broad he  ii component generally requires multi - component fitting ( see e.g. goad and koratkar 1998 ) which without prior information ( for example , variability data )",
    ", is rather subjective .",
    "since the quality ( in terms of s / n ) of the individual spectra in both our ghost - candidate and comparison samples is relatively low , we do not attempt to fit to the individual line components . instead",
    ", we use our non - balqso composite spectrum as a template for the region of interest , and scale each spectrum to this template , by minimising the residual flux in the region of interest .",
    "our optimisation routine fits for the underlying continuum in both spectra , and adjusts for both redshift errors and the scale factor over the region of interest ( nominally @xmath51600 - 1680 ) .",
    "since both spectra are first normalised to the flux in the continuum band between @xmath517001750 , if we assume that the he  ii and [ o  iii ] emission line strengths scale together , then the derived scaling factor between the ghost - candidate and non - bal qso spectra is a measure of the ratio of their he  ii ews .",
    "figure  [ fig : heii_fit ] shows an example of a fit . in the top panel",
    "we show the non - balqso composite ( solid line ) and a ghost - candidate spectrum ( dotted line ) . in the middle panel",
    "we show the spectra together with their continuum fits spanning the c  iv  he  ii region , while in the lower panel we show a close - up of the non - balqso composite and the scaled ghost - candidate spectrum after removal of the underlying continuum .",
    "the residual flux under the he  ii[o  iii ] lines is indicated by the dot - dashed line .",
    "we caution that this fitting process is sensitive to ( i ) small redshift errors between the spectra , ( ii ) an appropriate choice of continuum bands ( in general the choice of the continuum bands depend on the width of the c  iv absorption trough , and most importantly ( iii ) the s / n of the spectra .",
    "consequently the error on the scale factor is generally quite large . we have visually inspected the results of the fitting process for all of our ghost - candidate and comparison spectra to verify that the fitting procedure has converged correctly , adjusting the continuum bands , and region over which the spectra are scaled when necessary . in table  1",
    "we list the he  ii scale factors , that is , the multiplication factor necessary to produce the same equivalent width in the ghost - candidate spectrum .",
    "a number less than 1 indicates that the ghost - candidate spectrum has larger equivalent width in the line in the region of he  ii than the non - balqso spectrum .",
    "conversely , numbers greater than 1 indicate that the ghost feature has a proportionately weaker he  ii line . in order to determine error estimates on the derived scale factors , after determining a best - fit solution , we fix all parameters apart from the scale factor , and then minimise on this parameter only .",
    "we then calculate the 90% confidence interval on this one interesting parameter from the best - fit model by varying the scale factor until the @xmath18 value has increased by 2.71 . both the best - fit scale factor and its range ( based on the 90% confidence interval ) ,",
    "are given in table  1 and 2 .",
    "for our sample of 21 ghost - candidates for which all criteria can be tested , 5 indicate a significantly weaker he  ii ew , suggesting a weaker than average uv continuum .",
    "only 5 objects show evidence for a stronger than average he  ii ew . for the rest",

    "for the 22 ghost - candidates for which only some of the criteria can be tested , 5 show evidence for a weaker than average he  ii ews , 6 indicate stronger than average he  ii ews , and the rest indicate no significant difference in the he  ii ew when compared to the non - balqso composite .",

    "if we ignore the likely complex interaction between the ly-@xmath0 photons and nv ions ( ie .",
    "we assume the optical depth in the flow is effectively constant with velocity ) , then naively one might expect that the ghost - feature should be at least as broad as the ly-@xmath0 emission - line responsible for its formation .",
    "we note that in fact scattering is likely dominated by the line core where the optical depth is larger . by requiring that any observed ghost feature is at least as broad as ly-@xmath0",
    ", we can further refine our ghost - candidate sample to leave only the best ghost - candidates . while the width of any ghost - feature is relatively easy to measure ( unless the s / n is low ) , we are once again limited by the accuracy to which we can measure the width of ly-@xmath0 , as this emission is absorbed in the process by which the ghost is formed . here",
    "we again make use of the width of the c  iv emission - line ( see  4.3 ) as a surrogate for the width of ly-@xmath0 .",
    "we isolate the ghost feature by removing the underlying absorption trough by fitting a simple function ( cubic spline ) .",
    "we then fit a single gaussian to the ghost feature to provide an estimate of its width .",
    "the measured widths are listed in table  1 .",
    "we find no correlation between the width of the ghost feature and the width of the c  iv emission - line ( figure  [ fig : fwhm ] ) .",

    "if we require that the fwhm of the ghost feature matches that of the c  iv emission - line to within 1500  km  s@xmath2 then 11/20 ( for one object we are unable to make emission - line width measurements ) of our ghost - candidates for which all ghost - formation criteria can be tested also match this criterion . for our remaining ghost - candidates 8/17 ( 5 objects have no emission - line width information )",

    "18/21 also satisfy the condition for strong intrinsic ly-@xmath0 emission . however , less than half of the objects ( 12/21 ) satisfy the condition for narrow emission - lines , and even fewer ( 5/21 ) show weaker than average he  ii ew .",
    "while 11/21 objects satisfy the first 3 criteria , no single object meets all of the requirements for the formation of an observable ghost feature . for the remaining 22 objects , only 3 objects pass 2 of the first 3 criteria , and of these all show stronger than average he  ii . of the 5 objects which indicate weaker than average he  ii strengths ,",

    "thus , _ none _ of the objects in our comparison sample meet all of the criteria necessary for the formation of an observable ghost feature .",
    "a comparison between our ghost - candidate and non - ghost samples suggests that the main difference between them lies in the strength of the absorption , with our ghost candidate sample displaying more objects with strong n  v absorption .",
    "comparison of the geometric mean composite spectra of these two samples , and their ratio ( figure  13 dashed ( ghost - candidate ) and dotted ( non - ghost comparison spectra ) lines , indicates that the ghost - candidate composite shows significantly stronger absorption at lower velocities in all of the strong lines ly-@xmath0 , n  v , si  iv and c  iv .    in order to test whether peaks are more common within the ghost - zone than elsewhere , we repeat the ghost selection method using two `` fake '' ghost - zones ( red - ward and blue - ward of the original ghost - zone ) , in a similar fashion to north et  al . ( 2006 ) .",
    "these zones are created in precisely the same way as the ghost - zone except that the red zone is centred at 4000  km  s@xmath2 while the blue zone is centred at 8000  km  s@xmath2 blue - ward of the c  iv emission - line .",
    "of the 258 single peaked objects , 82 have peaks within the `` fake '' red zone and 50 have peaks within the fake `` blue - zone '' .",
    "since the original ghost - zone contained 69 objects with single peaks , the evidence for an excess of objects with peaks at a preferred velocity is weak .",
    "that is , single peaks within the ghost zone are no more likely than single peaks at other velocities .",
    "we have also examined the link , if any , between the peaks within the c  iv absorption trough and n  v absorption . in order to select n  v bals we use a modified balnicity index ( weymann 1991 ) .",
    "we take the continuum to be equal to the mean flux between @xmath513151330 , and require that the flux drops to below 90% of this value continuously for @xmath15  km  s@xmath2 between 0 and 7000  km  s@xmath2 blue - ward of the n  v emission line . in order to perform this test",
    "we require objects with redshifts in excess of 2.15 . from a sample of 1747 objects with z@xmath122.15",
    ", we find 1258 n  v bals and 489 n  v non - bals .",
    "27% ( 340 ) of the n  v bals show multiple troughs in their c  iv absorption compared to only 15.5% ( 76 ) of the n  v non - bals .",
    "similarly , 7.6% ( 95 ) of the n  v bals and only 3.1% ( 15 ) of the n  v non - bals show a single peak in the c  iv absorption trough . among the n  v non - bals",

    ", we find : i ) 26 objects with single peaks within the ghost - zone , ii ) 14 with single peaks within the fake blue zone , and iii ) 33 with single peaks within the fake red zone . while these results indicate a strong link between the presence of n  v absorption and the mechanism responsible for producing features within the c  iv absorption trough , line - locking between ly-@xmath0 and nv does not appear to be the dominant mechanism .    in summary ,",
    "n  v bals are more likely to have multiple troughs within the c  iv absorption than n  v non - bals ( factor of 2 ) .",
    "further , n  v bals are also more likely to display single - peaks within their c  iv absorption than n  v non - bals .",
    "approximately 25% of the single peaked objects are located within the ghost - zone .",
    "however , similar numbers are found in both the blue and red fake ghost zones .",
    "thus while strong n  v absorption appears to be a strong requirement for the appearance of features within the c  iv absorption trough of balqsos , there is no preferred velocity for the location of these features .",
    "in an analysis of the largest sample of balqsos derived from dr5 of sdss , we have identified 43 objects which show evidence for radiative driving , as indicated by the appearance of feature in the c  iv absorption , and thought to be associated with the interaction between ly-@xmath0 photons and n  v ions .",
    "we have attempted to explore the reality of these ghost - features by testing the physically motivated criteria , as set out by arav , for the formation of observable features via this mechanism .",
    "of the 21 objects for which we can test all of the criteria , _ none _ satisfy all of the conditions necessary for the formation of an observable feature .",
    "two of the criteria , the width of the driving line , and the strength of the uv continuum are particularly difficult to measure . of the 5 objects that clearly pass the latter criteria , having weak he  ii",
    ", 4 have widths that are marginally larger than the upper limit imposed by arav necessary to produce strong ghost signatures , while the other appears to have only weak emission - lines .",
    "we recognise that because of the large uncertainty on the measurements of the he  ii strength , 8 further objects from the sample of 21 could potentially satisfy all of the criteria necessary for ghost - formation . addressing",
    "this issue will require higher s / n data than currently available for these objects .",
    "however , taken at face value either the conditions necessary for line - locking to occur are less stringent than previously proposed , or a large fraction of these objects are multi - trough interlopers masquerading as ghost - candidates .",
    "this possibility is supported by our finding that the fake ghost zones bracketing the real ghost zone contain comparable numbers of objects as the real ghost zone .",
    "this suggests that the peaks observed within bal troughs at the position of the ghost - zone are not a physical effect of radiative line driving , but are instead independent of any systematic velocity .",
    "since our analysis has shed real doubt as to the existence of ly-@xmath0-n  v line - locking features , in the attached appendix we repeat for the interested reader , the sequence of tests by korista et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) and re - investigate the incidence of double - trough phenomena in a large sample of balqsos . in summary , the results of these tests show that there is no strong evidence for an excess of double troughs bracketing the region of ghost - formation , and that the evidence for line - locking between ly-@xmath0 photons and n  v ions in balqso spectra is substantially lacking .",

    "sdss  j101056.68 + 355833.3 meets the criteria for strong emission due to c  iv and n  v emission exceeding 100% of the continuum flux at their peak , shows clear n  v absorption , has c  iv fwhm measured as 3483  km  s@xmath2 and an ew of he  ii measured to be 3.58@xmath140.82   .",
    "these measurements place this object very close to the boundary on several criteria and it would not be surprising to see a ghost feature in this object . while no ghost feature can be seen in the c  iv trough , there is a clear feature within the si  iv trough ( @xmath16200 km  s@xmath2 ) within the ghost zone . due to the greater separation of the si  iv doublet(1933  km  s@xmath2 ) in comparison to the c  iv doublet(498 km  s@xmath2 ) a ghost feature in the si",
    "iv would be expected to be wider and weaker .",
    "this larger doublet separation is the reason for the wider ghost zone in the s  iv bal trough .",
    "the absence of a c  iv feature could be due to an extremely high optical depth in the flow such that the flow remains optically thick even with the decrease in optical depth caused by the acceleration due to n  v ions .",
    "however the absorption troughs of c  iv and si  iv look very similar with the exception of the potential ghost feature suggesting the optical depths are similar . there is a slight hint of an additional feature within the si  iv at @xmath18200 km  s@xmath2 which is in the appropriate region to be due to the lower wavelength doublet feature from si  iv ."

    "<S> significantly , we find no evidence for an excess of objects whose absorption troughs bracket the location of the ly-@xmath0nv line - locking region , rather the location of ghost - like features appears to be independent of any systematic velocity , with comparable numbers appearing both redward and blueward of the ghost - zone . </S>",
