    "heavy fermion @xcite ( hf ) superconductivity ( sc ) has drawn much attention since the discovery of superconductivity in cecu@xmath2si@xmath2 @xcite which is likely characterized by an anisotropic order parameter with symmetry yet to be determined .",
    "it became apparent over the last decade that almost all hf materials are unstable with respect to magnetic or superconducting phase transitions , which either compete with each other or can even coexist as found in uranium based materials .",
    "moreover , superconductivity in ube@xmath3 develops out of an incoherent metallic phase with a high resistance at @xmath4 of @xmath5 . the two - channel anderson lattice model , @xmath6",
    "is believed to serve as a possible descriptions of the electronic properties of ube@xmath3 or pr@xmath7 compounds with cubic symmetry .",
    "@xmath8 is the band dispersion of the two conduction bands @xmath9 coupling to the localized doublets via hybridization @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 are the usual hubbard operators describing local @xmath12-states at each lattice side @xmath13 .",
    "one doublet is assoziated with a quadrupolar charge distribution @xmath14 and one carried a spin @xmath15 .",
    "its paramagnetic phase is characterized by a large residual resistivity and entropy , and ill defined electronic quasi - particles .",
    "fermi liquid physics is restored by cooperative ordering or applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the local two - particle - particle irreducible vertex has a @xmath16 singularity and is odd with respect to the incoming and outgoing frequencies @xcite .",
    "this is related to the fact that correlations are induced through consecutive hybridization processes on the @xmath12-shell due to the strong on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "therefore , odd - frequency superconductivity @xcite is favoured in this model . assuming an order parameter with @xmath17 symmetry , the order parameter must have spin singlet , channel single ( sscs ) symmetry or spin triplet , channel triplet ( stct ) symmetry . only for the latter case ,",
    "a stable solution was found .",
    "the order parameter in the stct sector @xmath18 \\komma \\label{eqn : stct - order - param}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] correlates a local @xmath12-spin ( quadrupolar moment ) @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) - @xmath21 - component with a itinerate cooper pair @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) in the ssct ( stcs ) sector : @xmath24 the form factor @xmath25 transforms as @xmath17 , and @xmath26 is a bi - spinor in spin and channel space .",
    "@xmath27 is invariant with respect to exchanging the orbital and the magnetic doublet @xmath28 and @xmath29 and a simultaneous particle - hole transformation of the conduction electrons .",
    "hence , the occurrence of superconductivity is independent of the character of the local ground state of the local ion .",
    "we investigate the superconducting phase within the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) by self - consistently calculating the anomalous self - energy under the presents of a cooper - pair field .",
    "the nambu green function is an @xmath30 matrix in spin and orbital space . assuming no directional coupling between spin and orbital degrees of freedom , the anomalous @xmath31 self - energy matrix may be written as @xmath32 $ ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constant unity vectors in spin and channel space , and the amplitude function @xmath35 has to be odd in frequency .",
    "this reduces the full problem to a standard @xmath36 size for @xmath37 and the diagonal self - energy @xmath38 . in order to derive dmft equations with a purely local self - energy matrix @xmath39",
    ", the anomalous self - energy is restricted to isotropic pairs , e.  g.  @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 denotes the medium matrix in which the effective impurity is embedded .",
    "it is related to a generalized anderson width matrix through @xmath42 and has normal and anomalous components describing quasi - particle propagation and pair - creation and annihilation , respectively .",
    "the band electron self - energy @xmath43^{-1 } $ ] is determined by the local @xmath44-matrix @xmath45 whose diagonal elements are given by the local quasi - particle scattering matrices @xmath46 , and its anomalous contribution stems from cooper pairs scattered on the local shells .    as an impurity solver for effective site problem of the dmft , the nca @xcite was extended to the superconducting phase .",
    "the additional terms @xmath47 to the self - consistency equation for the local ionic propagators are generated by the anomalous media in the sc phase .",
    "@xmath48 where @xmath49_{12}(\\e - i\\delta)/\\pi$ ] is the spectral function of the anomalous media .",
    "the anomalous local @xmath44-matrix is also obtained by the same additional diagram of the generating functional and reads @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the partition function of the effective site , and the contour c encircles all singularites of the integral kernel .",
    "these coupled double integral equations are numerically solved using similar techniques as developed for the post - nca equations @xcite .",
    "we calculated the self - consistent dmft solution of the spectral functions close to @xmath4 which are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] .",
    "the linear frequency dependency of the quasi - particle and anomalous green function very close to @xmath1 , similar to @xmath58-wave superconductivity , is clearly visible .",
    "the opening of a pseudo - gap indicates a decrease of the energy in the superconducting phase , and , hence , its thermodynamical stability .",
    "details of the filling dependence and the phase diagram are beyond the scope of this paper and will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
