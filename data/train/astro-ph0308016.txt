    "these stars are hence the local equivalent of the high redshift universe ( for recent reviews on emp stars see cayrel 1996 , beers 1999 , 2000 ; preston 2000 ) .    in the past decade",
    ", numerous studies have focused on abundance analysis of very metal - poor stars . in the early works of mcwilliam etal .",
    "( 1995b ) and ryan etal .",
    "( 1996 ) , it was found that many elements show a sudden change in the slope of their abundances relative to fe , near @xmath4}=-2.5 $ ] .",
    "other elements , including ba and sr , show a large scatter from star - to - star at very low [ fe / h ] , indicating that the gas clouds from which these stars formed were polluted by the products of only a few , if not single , supernovae ( see , e.g. , shigeyama & tsujimoto 1998 ; tsujimoto etal .",
    "thus , with individual emp stars we can indirectly study the first generation of massive stars , which exploded in supernovae of type  ii ( hereafter sn  ii ) .",
    "furthermore , karlsson & gustafsson ( 2001 ) have shown that the inspection of patterns seen in abundance correlation diagrams of a large , homogeneously - analyzed sample of stars allows one to constrain theoretical yield calculations , and to perhaps even determine the mass function of the first generation of stars .",
    "emp stars also contribute to observational cosmology : the abundances of light elements ( in particular li ) , through models of big bang nucleosynthesis , put limits on the baryonic content of the universe ( e.g. , ryan etal .",
    "1999 ) , and individual age determinations of the oldest stars  either by nucleo - chronometry ( e.g. , cowan etal .  1999 ; cayrel etal .",
    "2001 ) , or by means of application of stellar evolutionary tracks ( e.g. , fuhrmann 1998 )  yield a lower limit for the age of the galaxy , and hence the universe .",
    "however , it should be recognized that , owing to their rarity , the road to obtaining elemental abundances for emp stars is long and arduous .",
    "the process involves three major observational steps ( see figure  1 ) : ( 1 ) a wide - angle survey must be carried out , and candidates for metal - poor stars have to be selected ; ( 2 ) moderate - resolution ( @xmath5 ) spectroscopic follow - up observations of the candidates needs to be done in order to validate the genuinely metal - poor stars among them ; and ( 3 ) high - resolution spectroscopy has to be obtained .",
    "step ( 1 ) can be carried in many different ways ( for a review , see beers 2000 ) , for example , with proper - motion surveys or photometric surveys . however , spectroscopic surveys are the most efficient way to find large numbers of emp stars , and they have the advantage that the samples they yield are not kinematically biased , as opposed to proper - motion selected samples .    until recently , the main source of emp stars was the hk survey of beers and colleagues ( beers etal .  1985 ; beers 1999 ) , which so far has yielded about @xmath6 stars with @xmath4}<-3.0 $ ] . for most of them ,",
    "high resolution ( @xmath7 ) spectroscopy has now been obtained ( see , e.g. , ryan etal .",
    "1996 ; norris etal.2001 ) . as a consequence , the abundance trends of many elements",
    "are now well - determined down to metalicities of @xmath4}\\sim -3.5 $ ] .",
    "still larger samples of emp stars are needed to identify the small subset of stars that are even more exotic then the emp stars themselves , e.g. , stars with strong enhancements of the r - process elements , suitable for nucleo - chronometric age dating ( cowan etal .  1997 , 1999 ; cayrel etal .",
    "2001 ; hill etal .",
    "the frequency of these stars among metal - poor giants with @xmath4}<-2.5 $ ] has been found in the hk survey to be as low as @xmath8% , a paucity confirmed by recent he s results ( see section  4.2 for details ) .",
    "he01075240 is another example of an extremely rare star .",
    "it is a giant with @xmath4}=-5.3 $ ] ( christlieb etal .",
    "2002a ) , which was found during follow - up observations of @xmath9 stars with @xmath4}<-3.0 $ ] ( see section  4.4 below ) .",
    "figure 1 : the three major observational steps towards obtaining elemental abundances of extremely metal - poor stars : ( 1 ) objective - prism spectra , yielding candidate metal - poor stars ; ( 2 ) vetting of candidates by moderate - resolution follow - up spectroscopy ; ( 3 ) high - resolution spectroscopy of confirmed candidates .",
    "furthermore , stars of the lowest metallicity place strong constraints on the nature of the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) , which presumably arises from the ejected yields of the first generations of stars .",
    "for example , with the exception of the star at @xmath4 } = -5.3 $ ] , it appears that the lowest abundance stars in the galaxy reach no lower than [ fe / h ] @xmath10 , hence this is the level of early `` pollution '' of the ism one might demand to be reached by the products of first generation stars .",
    "one also would like to test whether the mdf , as reflected by observations of halo stars in the solar neighborhood , remains constant or varies with galactocentric distance .    the hamburg / eso objective - prism survey ( he s ; wisotzki etal .",
    "2000 ) offers the opportunity to increase the number of emp stars by at least a factor of five with respect to the hk survey , since the he s is more than @xmath11mag deeper , and covers regions of the sky not included in the hk survey ( see figure  2 ) . for a detailed comparison of the he s with the hk survey , see christlieb & beers ( 2000 ) .",

    "1999 ) .",
    "the selection has so far been restricted to unsaturated point sources . for stars brighter than @xmath17mag , saturation effects ( in particular in the red portions of the prism spectra ) begin to occur .",
    "investigations on methods for recovering at least a portion of these brighter candidates are underway ( frebel etal . , in preparation ) .",
    "the importance of the bright sources comes from the relative ease with which high - resolution spectroscopy can be obtained .",
    "extended sources are being rejected because spatial extension leads to smeared - out spectral lines in slitless spectra , and therefore many galaxies would otherwise enter the candidate sample as false positives .    a total of @xmath18 candidate metal - poor turnoff stars have been selected from the 329 ( out of 380 ) he s fields that are currently used for stellar work .",
    "these fields cover a nominal area of @xmath19 of the southern extragalactic sky .",
    "the covered area is reduced to an effective area of @xmath20 due to overlapping spectra ( wisotzki etal .",
    "2000 ; christlieb etal .",
    "in addition to the turnoff stars , @xmath21 metal - poor candidates with @xmath22 were selected , including @xmath23 ( i.e. , @xmath24% ) candidates expected to have large over - abundances of carbon ( @xmath25}>1.0 $ ] ) .",
    "these stars are readily identifiable in the he s from their strong ch g  bands ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "a sample of 403 faint high latitude carbon ( fhlc ) stars has already been published ( christlieb etal .",
    "2001a ) , and that sample contains many carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars as well , as recent follow - up observations have demonstrated .",
    "as noted above , the he s is a very rich source for metal - poor giants .",
    "this is especially valuable because the present hk survey sample is dominated by hotter stars near the main - sequence turnoff , due to a temperature - related bias incurred by the initial visual selection of hk candidates . as a result ,",
    "only roughly 20% of the hk stars are metal - poor giants .",
    "however , efforts are under way to recover metal - poor hk survey giants , by means of artificial neural network classifications of spectra extracted from digitized hk survey plates ( rhee 2000 ) in combination with @xmath26 colors from the 2mass survey ( skrutskie etal .  1997 ) .",
    "moderate resolution ( @xmath5 ) follow - up observations are needed to verify the metal - poor nature of the he s candidates .",
    "this is the bottleneck in every large survey for emp stars , and the only way to cope with this is to establish large collaborations , involving many people , with access to many different telescopes . to provide the reader an impression of the extent of this effort",
    ", we list in table  1 the telescopes that have been used in 2002 for follow - up of he s candidates , and the numbers of stars observed .    follow - up spectra of @xmath27 at caii  k are required to determine [ fe / h ] of the metal - poor candidates with an accuracy of 0.20.3dex , using the technique of beers etal .",

    "the higher yields of the he s can mainly be attributed to the fact that @xmath62 colors can be derived directly from the objective - prism spectra with an accuracy of better than @xmath63mag ( christlieb etal .",
    "2001b ) , the higher quality of the he s spectra , and the employment of quantitative selection criteria , as opposed to visual selection in the hk survey .",

    "however , when the eys within each of the candidate classes ( as assigned during the visual verification of the he s candidates ) are applied to the respective fraction of candidates within the total set of he s candidates , overall eys of 4% for stars with @xmath4}<-3.0 $ ] result for turnoff stars and giants .",

    "stars like he00242523 provide the unique opportunity to study an extinct generation of extremely metal - poor agb stars that left their fingerprints on their less massive companions .",
    "these stars place strong observational constraints on simulations of the structure , evolution , and nucleosynthesis of agb stars , and allow us to study the s - process at very low metalicities .",
    "recent calculations of goriely & siess ( 2001 ) predict that an efficient production of s - process elements takes place even in zero metalicity agb stars , despite the absence of iron seeds , provided that protons are mixed into carbon - rich layers .",
    "proton mixing results in the formation of @xmath76c , which is a strong neutron source due to the reaction @xmath76c(@xmath77 , n)@xmath78o .",
    "the strong over - abundances of pb in he00242523 and other `` pb stars '' ( aoki etal .",
    "2000 ; vaneck etal .  2001 ; aoki etal.2002b ) are in concert with these predictions .",
    "another exotic star found with keck / hires observations is the emp turnoff star he  2148@xmath791247 .",
    "it appears that this star is enriched in both its r- _ and _ s - process elements , similar to cs  22898 - 027 ( preston & sneden 2001 ; aoki etal .",
    "2002b ) , which is almost a twin of he  2148@xmath791247 with respect to stellar parameters as well as abundances , and a few other stars in the literature ( preston & sneden 2001 ; aoki etal .",
    "2002b ; hill etal .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "cohen etal .",
    "( 2003 ) propose a scenario for explaining the abundance pattern of he  2148@xmath791247 .",
    "they suggest that the star is a member of a binary system ( and in fact , the star shows significant radial variations ) in which the former primary went through the agb phase . in this stage",
    ", carbon and s - process elements were dumped onto the surface of he  2148@xmath791247 via mass transfer .",
    "the former primary then evolved into a white dwarf .",
    "mass transfer then occurred into the _ reverse _ direction , i.e. , from he  2148@xmath791247 to the white dwarf , which led to an accretion - induced collapse of the white dwarf into a neutron star .",
    "r - process nucleosynthesis then occurs in a neutrino - driven wind of the neutron star , and the nucleosynthesis products contaminate the surface layers of the star that we see today .      emp stars with strong enhancements of r - process elements , like cs  22892 - 052 ( mcwilliam etal .",
    "1995 ; sneden etal .  1996",
    "; cowan etal .",
    "1997 ) , and cs  31082 - 001 ( cayrel etal .  2001 ; hill etal .",
    "2002 ) , are suitable for individual age determinations through the detection of the long - lived radioactive species thorium and/or uranium .",
    "such old stars can therefore provide lower limits to the age of the galaxy , and hence the universe .",
    "however , it appears that the pairs of elements used as chronometers need to be chosen very carefully .",
    "the results of hill etal.(2002 ) suggest that comparison of the abundance of th with that of the stable r - process element eu does not yield reliable ages for all stars , and in particular an unrealistically small age for cs  31082 - 001 .",
    "th / eu is roughly a factor of three higher in cs  31081 - 001 than observed in cs  22892 - 052 , yielding a radioactive decay age for cs  31082 - 001 that is younger than the sun !",
    "u / th is expected to be a more accurate chronometer , due to the fact that @xmath80u , with a half - life as `` short '' as 4.5gyr ( for comparison , @xmath81th has a half - life of 14gyr ) , is involved .",
    "furthermore , recent theoretical studies on r - process nucleosynthesis ( wanajo etal .  2002 ; schatz etal .",
    "2002 ) reveal that this chronometer is less sensitive to uncertainties of nuclear physics than any other chronometer that is amenable to observation in emp stars .",
    "unfortunately , it is observationally very challenging to detect uranium in metal - poor stars ; cs  31081 - 001 was the first one for which such a detection has been made .",
    "this is because the strongest spectral line in the optical , u  ii @xmath82 , is very weak ( see figure 9 of hill etal .",
    "2002 ) , even if the enhancement of r - process elements is as high as @xmath83}=1.7$]dex , as observed in cs  31081 - 001 .",
    "therefore , spectra of @xmath84 per pixel and @xmath85 are required for derivation of accurate u abundances . also , one has to contend with the difficulty that , if the carbon abundance is significantly enhanced with respect to iron , as is the case for cs  22892 - 052 ( @xmath25}=0.98 $ ] ; mcwilliam etal .",
    "1995 ) , the u line is blended with a cn line . as a result ,",
    "measurement of an u abundance is impossible forcs  22892 - 052 .    quite apart from their obvious use in individual age determination ,",
    "strongly r - process - enhanced metal - poor stars allow one to study r - process nucleosynthesis in general , and possibly to identify the site(s ) of the r - process .",
    "while the abundance pattern of cs  22892 - 052 for the heavier stable neutron - capture elements ( @xmath86 ) , and the abundances of the elements in the range @xmath87 in cs  31082 - 001 match a scaled solar r - process pattern very well , deviations are seen for some of the lighter neutron - capture elements in both stars , and for th ( as discussed above ) and possibly os in cs  31082 - 001 .",
    "it has therefore been suggested ( sneden etal .",
    "2000 ; hill etal .",
    "2002 ) that ( at least ) two r - processes must be at work .    given these results , it is clear that a much larger sample of strongly r - process- enhanced metal - poor stars is required .",

    "s_urvey is aiming to increase the number of strongly r - process - enhanced stars to ( conservatively ) @xmath8810 , and to study a major fraction of these by means of high - resolution , high signal - to - noise uves spectra .",
    "the project is carried out in the framework of an eso large programme ( p.i .",
    "christlieb ) , which was recently approved for an initial period of one year .    stars with strong r - process enhancement can be readily recognized from their prominent europium lines .",
    "for example , cs  22892 - 052 has an eu  ii @xmath89 line as strong as @xmath90m .",

    "mixed over a wide range of the mass coordinate , and that a large fraction of the material falls back onto the compact remnant ( the `` mixing and fallback '' mechanism ) , umeda & nomoto are able to reproduce the abundance pattern of he01075240 remarkably well ( see their figure 1 ) . in particular , very high c / fe and n / fe ratios",
    "can be produced in this scenario ( with the cno elements produced in late stages of the evolution of the sn progenitor ) , offering an interesting possibility for explaining why a large fraction of the extremely metal - poor stars exhibit high enhancements of carbon ( for a similar work on the abundance patterns of cs  29498 - 043 and cs  22949 - 037 see tsujimoto & shigeyama 2003 ) .",
    "the scenario of umeda & nomoto is also very attractive in that it does not require the existence of a binary companion for the cemp stars .",
    "in fact , there are at least three unevolved cemp stars known that do not show any radial velocity variations larger than 0.4  kms@xmath102 over a period of 8 years ( preston & sneden 2001 ) , ruling out , at least for these three stars , the scenario in which a formerly more massive star went through its agb phase and transfered dredged - up material onto the surface of the less massive companion , which we observe as a cemp star today .",
    "umeda & nomoto predict an o abundance of @xmath103}=+2.8$]dex for he01075240 .",
    "a high - resolution , high @xmath73 spectrum of he01075240 , covering the near uv region down to the atmospheric cutoff , has now been obtained with vlt / uves .",
    "spectrum synthesis calculations suggest that the detection of uv - oh lines is possible if @xmath103}>+0.3$]dex .",
    "therefore , the predictions of umeda & nomoto can soon be tested .",
    "i am grateful to d. reimers ( p.i .  of the he s ) and l. wisotzki ( he s project scientist ) for making my work on the he s possible .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge the contributions of my numerous collaborators to he s metal - poor star research over the last years . here",
