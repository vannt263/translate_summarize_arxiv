    "nitromethane is one of the simplest organic compound which belong to the class of secondary explosives .",
    "it is insensitive , safe to handle , used as a storable monopropellant and as an additive fuel for combustion engines .",
    "because of its simple crystal structure compared with other secondary explosives , it has been used as a prototype material to understand the energetic materials by both experimentalists@xcite and theoreticians.@xcite nitromethane is liquid at room temperature but the molecules condense to form a solid at around 4.2 k. trivero et al@xcite first reported x - rays and neutron diffraction experiments , and found that solid nitromethane crystalizes in an orthorhombic structure in the space group p2@xmath52@xmath52@xmath5 . also , several experimental studies have been reported on the structural@xcite and the dynamical@xcite properties of nitromethane at various pressures and temperatures . a considerable amount of theoretical",
    "work has been performed using classical and quantum molecular dynamics simulations under various conditions.@xcite by using classical interatomic potential molecular dynamics simulations , sorescu et al.@xcite predicted the structural properties of nitromethane crystals .",
    "the thermal decomposition of nitromethane was investigated using car - parrinello molecular dynamics simulations , which reveals that it undergoes a thermal decomposition at 2200 k with the cleavage of the c - n bonds.@xcite the anisotropic nature of solid nitromethane was studied using pseudopotential approach by applying hydrostatic pressure up to 20 gpa.@xcite recently , sorescu et al.@xcite and landerville et al.@xcite reported the structural properties of nitromethane using respectively the parametrization of grimme@xcite and of neumann and perrin.@xcite    accurate and reliable calculations of electronic properties of secondary explosive materials with standard density functional theory(dft ) are a difficult and challenging issue due to their complex crystal structure mainly controlled by van der waals interactions . also , the electronic band gap plays a major role in determining the impact sensitivity and detonation or defragmentation properties of explosive materials .",
    "it is well known that standard dft using exchange - correlational functionals like the local density approximation ( lda ) or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) always underestimate the band gap by about 30 - 40@xmath6,@xcite therefore one has to use for instance the gw approximation to know the exact band gap value accurately.@xcite in the present study , efforts are taken to understand the structural and dynamical properties of solid nitromethane at zero and high pressures including van der waals interaction .",
    "we also predict the elastic constants of this material to explore the stability and detonation characteristics .",
    "in addition to these calculations , quasiparticle band structure using the gw approximation and thereby the optical properties of the solid nitromethane are studied .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly describe the computational techniques while the results and discussions are presented in section iii . finally , a brief conclusion is given in section iv .",
    "the ground state properties are obtained using dft in the kohn - sham formalism@xcite as implemented in the castep simulation package@xcite .",
    "the kohn - sham orbitals of the valence electrons are expressed in a plane wave basis set and ultrasoft pseudopotentials are used to describe the electron - nuclei interactions .",
    "the lda@xcite as well as the gga schemes of perdew and wang@xcite ( pw91 ) and of perdew - burke - ernzerhof@xcite ( pbe ) for the treatment of the exchange and correlation are used .",
    "structural optimizations were performed by minimizing the forces on each atom until they were lower then 0.03 ev@xmath7 . a plane wave kinetic energy cutoff of 620 ev was used and the brillouin zone was sampled on a regular monkhorst - pack @xcite grid of 6x5x4 points with a minimum spacing of 0.025 @xmath7 .",
    "the pseudopotentials were considered according to vanderbilt s ultrasoft @xcite scheme with a number of valence electrons of 1 for hydrogen , 4 for carbon , 5 for nitrogen , and 6 for oxygen . to take into account vdw interactions which are oftenly present in molecular crystals , we have used various dft - d methods as implemented in castep . in the case of dft - d calculations ,",
    "the total energies of the system can be expressed as e@xmath8=e@xmath9+e@xmath10 , where e@xmath9 is the self consistent kohn - sham energy and e@xmath10 is written as @xmath11 for each pair @xmath12 of atoms separated by a distance @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is a damping function which is necessary to avoid divergence for small values of @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the dispersion coefficient for the atom pair @xmath12 . in the present work ,",
    "different dft - d approaches to treat vdw interactions were employed , notably the ortmann , bechstedt and schmidt@xcite ( obs ) correction to pw91 , as well as the tkatchenko and scheffler@xcite ( ts ) and grimme ( g06)@xcite corrections to pbe .    in order to overcome the difficulties in density functional theory within standard functionals like the lda or the gga to calculate excited states , including the band gap which is underestimated , we have used the gw approximation @xcite to obtain the bandstructure of solid nitromethane . instead of the kohn - sham equations used in dft ,",
    "the following quasiparticle equation is solved : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the kinetic energy operator , @xmath19 is the external potential from the ion cores , @xmath20 is the hartree potential , @xmath21 is the self - energy operator , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the quasiparticle energy and the quasiparticle wave function .",
    "then , @xmath21 is approximated ( vertex corrections are neglected ) as the product of the green s function @xmath24 times the screened coulomb interaction @xmath25 , which gives the gw approximation . in practice , the gw quasiparticle eigenvalues are calculated as a correction to the dft eigenvalues @xmath26 like@xcite : @xmath27\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the qp renormalization factor @xmath28 being : latexmath:[\\[z^{dft}_{n{\\bf k}}=[1-\\langle\\psi^{dft}_{{\\bf k}n}| \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\omega } \\textrm{re}\\sigma({\\bf r},{\\bf r}^{\\prime } , \\epsilon_n({\\bf k } ) )     we have used the implementation of the g@xmath4w@xmath4 approximation@xcite provided by the code vasp(vienna ab - initio simulation package)@xcite . to obtain convergence ,",
    "we used 200 bands for the summation over the bands in the polarizability and the self - energy formulas , and the polarizability matrices were calculated up to a cut - off of @xmath30 ev .",

    ". moreover it is seen that when using pbe - g06 functional , a sudden change in the lattice parameters occurs between 10 gpa to 12 gpa : the lattice parameters a and b decreases with increasing pressure whereas the c lattice parameter increases with pressure .",
    "a similar behavior is observed with the lda and pbe functionals , although it happens at higher pressure ( between 15 gpa to 20 gpa ) .    to understand the sudden change in the lattice parameters",
    ", we have calculated the pressure dependence of the bond lengths and of the bond angles , the corresponding datas are shown in fig . 3 and fig .",
    "the change observed in the lattice parameters is also reflected in the bond lengths and bond angles .",

    "however in the pressure region 8 to 10 gpa , b@xmath5 modes decreases to zero and shown in fig .",
    "overall , the calculated vibrational frequencies at high pressure using pbe - g06 functional shows distinct intra and intermolecular modes at high pressures and the discontinuity in the internal and lattice modes point out to the structural transition in solid nitromethane between 10 to 12 gpa at low temperatures which is in good agreement with available experimental data.@xcite from 15 to 30 gpa , all the internal modes increases continuously and without any slope change , in agreement with earlier experiments . also , by increasing the pressure the energy gap between the internal and the external modes decreases to 30 cm@xmath7 , which is comparable with previous experiment .",
    "+     +      as mentioned earlier , in order to correlate the impact sensitivity of an explosive material with its electronic band gap , it is necessary to know the electronic band structure and the value of the band gap precisely . in particular , wei and xiao @xcite correlated the impact sensitivity with the band gap of azides and confirmed that the materials having the smallest the band gap are easier to decompose and to explode under external stimuli . in the case of nitromethane , there is no experimental evidence for the value of band gap to the best of our knowledge .",
    "our calculated bandstructure along high symmetry directions obtained with the gga approximation is presented in fig 8 ( solid lines ) .",
    "the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band occur at the @xmath47 and x high symmetry points respectively , and the magnitude of our gga bandgap ( 3.8 ev ) is in good agrement with the previously reported theoretical values of 3.61 ev @xcite and of 3.28 ev.@xcite however band - gaps obtained using standard dft functionals are usually underestimated when compared to experiments . to solve this problem ,",
    "we have used the gw approximation to treat excited states as implemented in the vasp code using projector augmented waves method.@xcite the calculated quasiparticle band structure of solid nitromethane is presented in fig . 8 ( red circles ) , where it is compared to its gga counterpart ( solid lines ) .",
    "w@xmath4 approximation ( red circles ) at experimental lattice vectors.,title=\"fig:\",width=259 ] +    our calculated gw band gap value is 7.8 ev , which is a significant correction of the gga value . as with the gga ,",
    "the band - gap is indirect from the @xmath47 point to the x point . from the calculated band structure as shown in fig 8 , the valence band splits into four distinct manifolds .",
    "the lower manifold that extends from about -3 ev to -4 ev is derived from the @xmath48 states of c atoms and partly of @xmath49 states of h atoms .",
    "the upper manifold that extends up to the fermi level is mostly from the hybridization of @xmath48 states of c and o atoms . respectively .",
    "the middle regions , that are -0.5 ev to -1.0 ev and -1.5 to -2 ev are due to the hybridization of c and o atoms . the conduction band is mainly dominated by the h - s states and from states of o and n atoms .",
    "moreover , the important correction brought by the gw approximation in the case of nitromethane implies that the gga values of the band gap usually used for other secondary explosives to predict their exact sensitive impact factor needs to be reinvestigated .",
    "in this section , we focus on the optical properties of solid nitromethane . in general ,",
    "the optical properties of matter can be described by means of the complex dielectric function @xmath50 = @xmath51 + @xmath52 , where @xmath51 and @xmath53 describes the dispersive and absorptive parts of the dielectric function . generally , there are two contributions to @xmath54(@xmath55 ) , namely the intraband and interband parts .",
    "the contribution of intraband transitions are important only for metals while the interband transitions can be split into direct and indirect transitions .",
    "we have neglected the indirect transitions involving scattering of phonons assuming that they give small contribution to @xmath54(@xmath55 ) in comparison to direct transitions.@xcite then @xmath54(_q=0 _ , @xmath55 ) is calculated using the random phase approximation without local field effects .",
    "in particular , the imaginary part is determined by a summation over empty states , and then the real part @xmath51 of the dielectric function can be evaluated from @xmath53 using kramer - kroning relations .",
    "the knowledge of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function allows the calculation of the important optical properties such as refractive index and absorption . since , solid nitromethane crystalizes in an orthorhombic structure ,",
    "the optical functions are expected to be different along the three crystallographic directions [ 1 0 0 ] , [ 0 1 0 ] and [ 0 0 1 ] .",
    "we have calculated the optical properties using the castep code within gga but a scissor shift of 4.6 ev is applied to the conduction bands to be consistent with the calculated value of the band gap obtained with the gw approximation .",
    "our calculated optical functions of solid nitromethane are presented in figure 9 for an energy range up to 25 ev .",
    "the dispersive part of the dielectric function ( @xmath51 ) is shown in fig 9 ( a ) . the static dielectric function @xmath56 of solid nitromethane along the three directions",
    "are found to be @xmath56= 1.42 along the [ 1 0 0 ] direction , @xmath56= 1.39 along the [ 0 1 0 ] direction and @xmath56=1.63 along the [ 0 0 1 ] direction .",
    "the absorptive part of the dielectric function ( @xmath53 ) is shown in fig .",
    "the main peaks in the [ 1 0 0 ] direction are marked as a ( at 9.5 ev ) , b ( at 11.7 ev ) , c ( at 13.8 ev ) and d ( at 16.9 ev ) .",
    "a similar structure is observed in the case of [ 0 1 0 ] and [ 0 0 1 ] crystallographic directions albeit with a slight energy shift and different intensities .",
    "the peak a originates from transitions between o ( p ) and h ( s ) states for all the three crystallographic directions .",
    "the peak b arises from transitions of the c ( p ) states to the h ( s ) states along [ 1 0 0 ] and [ 0 1 0 ] directions , while it is absent for the [ 0 0 1 ] direction .",
    "the peak c along the three directions comes from transitions between the s states of o and the p states of c to the p states of n and o atoms .",
    "the peak d results of transition from c , n , o p states to o , n 2s states along the three crystallographic directions .",
    "then from the calculated @xmath51 and @xmath53 , we have evaluated the refractive index ( n ) and absorption shown in fig .",

    ", it appears that solid nitromethane is an optically anisotropic material .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the structural properties of solid nitromethane within lda and gga with different functional including dispersion corrections to treat vdw forces .",
    "it was found that the structural properties using pbe - g06 are in good agreement with experiments , which highlight the role of vdw interactions in solid nitromethane .",
    "then , the influence of hydrostatic pressure on the structural properties such as the lattice parameters , the bond lengths , and the bond angles was calculated and a discontinuity in bond lengths and bond angles was observed between 10 gpa to 12 gpa . also , we have estimated the elastic constants for this material using pbe - g06 and found that the material is mechanically stable . in particular , solid nitromethane is stiffest along the crystallographic a - axis , followed by the b - axis , and then by the c - axis .",
    "the vibrational properties of solid nitromethane at ambient conditions have been calculated and a fairly good agrement with experiments was reported .",

    "supports a possible structural transition in solid nitromethane between 8 to 12 gpa and this was in excellent agreement with reported experiments .",
