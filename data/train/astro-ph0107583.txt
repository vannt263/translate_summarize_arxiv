    "classical novae ( cne ) belong to the class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and are formed by a white dwarf ( wd ) primary accreting matter from a roche lobe filling companion , usually a lower main sequence star .",
    "the wd is surrounded by an accretion disk , unless its magnetic field is strong enough to partially ( _ intermediate polar _",
    "systems ) or totally ( _ polar _ systems ) control the accretion geometry . stable mass transfer is ensured by angular momentum losses from the binary system due to the magnetic braking mechanism and gravitational radiation .",
    "thus , cvs evolve towards shorter and shorter orbital periods and lower and lower masses of the secondary .",
    "the orbital periods of cvs show a bimodal distribution characterized by a minimum period of @xmath5 min and a gap in the range 2h @xmath6 3h ( see warner 1995 for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "the 3h upper limit of the gap corresponds to secondary stars which are just becoming fully convective ( @xmath7 ) and in which the dynamo mechanism is partially suppressed leading to a drastic decrease of the efficiency of the magnetic braking and , consequently , of the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "the secondary then shrinks inside its roche lobe until gravitational radiation will bring them again in contact , which will happen when the binary has reached @xmath8 2h .",
    "the accretion luminosities of old novae are at any given orbital period systematically brighter than those of dwarf novae ( dne ) , suggesting that the former ones have higher mass transfer rates and/or hotter white dwarfs and thermally stable accretion discs .",
    "there seems to be no systematic difference between the pre- and the post- nova luminosities , although a few old novae appear 24 magnitudes brighter than in their pre - nova state . amongst these ,",
    "gq mus , cp pup and v1974 cyg have orbital periods below the period gap , while v1500 cyg is just above it @xcite .",
    "however , while strongly magnetized systems like gq mus and v1500 cyg , as ` polars ' , are expected to alternate between high and low states of their accretion rates , the explanation for the luminosity standstills of disc accreting systems like cp pup and v1974 cyg suggested by retter & naylor is that , after the outburst , they experience a constant superhump phase .",
    "rw umi is a high galactic latitude , probably slow , nova that brightened in 1956 reaching @xmath9 .",
    "it was first considered as a supernova by kukarkin due to its unusually large outburst amplitude and because it was apparently located out of the galactic halo .",
    "the pre - nova magnitude was estimated @xmath10 @xcite but its post - outburst magnitude still is about 2.2 mag brighter .",
    "esenoglu et al .   estimated the nebular parallax of the nova as @xmath11 pc .",
    "this yields @xmath12 at light maximum , and @xmath13 or @xmath14 before and after the outburst , respectively .",
    "thus the nova is located in the galactic halo .",
    "the first spectroscopic observation of rw umi was obtained by zwicky seven years after the maximum .",
    "the spectrum shows a bluish continuum with emissions of hydrogen , hei and heii .",
    "subsequent spectra obtained by kaluzny & chlebowski , szkody & howell and ringwald et al .   confirmed the steep blue continuum and the relatively high excitation state of the object .    the photometric behaviour of rw umi at light minimum has been object of debate .",
    "no light variations were found by kaluzny & chlebowski ; szkody et al .   suggested a periodicity of the order of 3 h , while howell et al .   found a period of 1.88 h. the possibility that the orbital period of rw umi falls below the 23 h gap of cvs @xcite triggered more systematic observations until retter & lipkin were able to unambiguosly determine a photometric period of @xmath15 d with a 0.025 mag amplitude . in the following",
    "we will refer to this period as the _ main _ period @xmath16 , as its precise nature is not really clear , although it is probably closely related to the orbital motion .",
    "an orbital period of the order of 85 min definitely places rw umi well below the 2 h lower limit of the period gap .",
    "this region of the period - luminosity diagram of cvs is populated by su uma systems .",
    "retter & lipkin suggested that rw umi is a non - magnetic cv which is experiencing a long post - outburst superhump phase like two more short - orbital - period old novae : cp pup and v1974 cyg .",
    "in this paper we present the results of a photometric study of the old nova aimed to identify possible sub - orbital periodicities in its light curve .",
    "we have obtained ccd images in 1999 and in 2000 using the wyoming infrared observatory ( wiro ) and the ekar ( asiago ) telescope , respectively . in section 2",
    "we present the observation and the data reduction , and present the photometric periods discovered . in section 3",
    "we discuss the general photometric behaviour of the old nova and suggest a physical explanation for the sub - orbital periods observed .",
    "the possible intermediate polar state of the post - nova is also discussed .",
    ".[rwobs ] the journal of the observations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table [ rwmag ] collects some historical magnitude determinations of rw umi , and reports , whenever possible , the range of the light modulation observed and the colours .",
    "while this list suggests a slow negative trend of the luminosity of the old nova , the reported ( mean ) magnitudes all lie within the observed short - term variations of the individual runs .",
    "thus , only future observations will be able to confirm such a possible decline .",
    "assuming that the period derived by retter & lipkin is very close to the actual orbital period ( see next section ) , and taking the recent correlation between the orbital period and the mass of the secondary star presented by howell , we may estimate the mass of the secondary in rw umi as @xmath17 .    in order to constrain the mass of the primary we make use of the velocity of decline from the nova outburst .",
    "warner reports @xmath18 = 114 d , which corresponds to a decline velocity @xmath19 = 0.02 mag / d . using the calibration given by della valle",
    "we obtain a maximum absolute magnitude @xmath20 mag . according to livio",
    "this is the luminosity produced by a white dwarf primary with @xmath21 . with this , we obtain a mass ratio @xmath22 .",
    "the above calculated masses and main geometrical parameters of the binary system are collected in table [ system ] .",
    "cvs can show several photometric periods , the most important ones are related to the orbital period .",
    "the most obvious case is that of cvs at sufficiently high inclination showing eclipses and/or luminosity bumps due to the hot spot .",
    "other important photometric modulations , which do not seem to be strongly related with the inclination of the binary system , are called ` superhumps ' and may differ by a few percent from the orbital period .",
    "actually , two opposite cases are observed :    * a ) * _ positive superhumps_. they mostly characterize su uma dn systems during super outbursts and are thought to be produced at relatively large mass transfer rates , when the outer edge of the accretion disc expands reaching the 3:1 resonance radius .",
    "positive superhumps then represent the beat period between the apsidal prograde precession of the eccentric outer edge of the disc and the orbital motion of the secondary .",
    "taking equations ( 3.34 ) and ( 3.42 ) from warner we find a relation between the positve superhump period @xmath23 and the orbital one @xmath24 : @xmath25 with @xmath26 = 0.16 , we obtain a positive superhump period 4% larger than the orbital one .",
    "this situation corresponds to the scenario suggested by retter & lipkin .",
    "they also suggested that , similarly to the other two short - orbital - period old novae cp pup and v1974 cyg , the presence of positive superhumps might be a consequence of the post - outburst higher accretion luminosity .    *",
    "b * ) _ negative superhumps_. a few cvs are known to show cyclical brightness modulations with periods shorter than the orbital one .",
    "this phenomenon is generally interpreted as the result of a precessing disc .",
    "the precession of the outer anulus of a tilted disc in this case is retrograde . from warner s equation ( 2.62c )",
    "we obtain for the negative superhump period @xmath27 : @xmath28 for rw umi this results in @xmath27 being 4% shorter than @xmath24 .",
    "we conclude that the period observed by retter & lipkin should represent the orbital period within 4% uncertainty .",
    "we furthermore note that our derived mass ratio @xmath26 = 0.16 well satisfies the condition @xmath29 0.22 for the formation of positive superhumps .",
    "this might favour the interpretation by retter & lipkin that @xmath16 represents a positive superhump period .",

    "these phenomena might be similar to those observed in lmxbs .",
    "however , probably due to the longer timescales in cvs , they have not been studied as thoroughly . the secondary , suborbital , periodicities found in rw umi are listed in table [ rwpeaks ] .",
    "lai has shown that the inner region of the accretion disc around a rotating magnetized collapsed object ( neutron star , white dwarf ) is subject to magnetic torques that induce warping and precession of the disc .",
    "the result is that a number of magnetically driven resonances between the disc and the rotating central dipole will arise . in some intermediate polar systems ( ips )",
    "the spin period of the wd is the same as that of the keplerian orbit at the magnetosphere radius , so the two rotational motions are equal . in this case",
    ", the magnetic field will easily produce a warped inner disc which rotates with the spin period of the wd .",
    "however , in order to produce observable interferences with the orbital motion , the warped structure must extend to a large fraction of the disc , so that its variable geometry can interact with the accretion stream from the secondary .",
    "this possibility will depend on the viscosity inside the disc and the intensity of the magnetic field of the primary .",
    "in general , outside some critical radius , viscous forces will overcome the magnetic torque and warping will be destroyed @xcite .",
    "however , since rw umi is a short orbital period system , which can host only a very small accretion disc , even a modest magnetic field might produce a warping that extends to a considerable portion of the disc .",
    "still , most ips are not synchronous rotators , so that the warping will be a much more complicated process , in which the outer parts of the disc might switch between prograde and retrograde precession .",
    "thus , rw umi might display both positive and negative superhumps , perhaps in a rather complex and unstable fashion .",
    "a key problem in the analysis of the suborbital periods is to detect the spin period of the wd . from our data",
    "we note that the period @xmath40 ( table [ rwpeaks ] ) is the most stable one over at least one year . in terms of keplerian velocities",
    ", it would correspond to an orbit with a radius @xmath54 , which is obviously impossible .",
    "we however note that @xmath40 fits quite well with the beat period between @xmath2 and @xmath16 . rather curiously , this match is better than the one obtained using the two possible alternative values for the orbital period @xmath55 ( see section 3.3 ) , although our precision does not really allow to conclusively decide between those possibilities .",
    "@xmath2 was observed only during one night at wiro and during one at ekar .",
    "although it is not the shortest of the detected periods , for the above reasons we tentatively assume it as the spin period of the magnetic wd . in the most general case of an inclined rotator , the inner disc region truncated by the magnetosphere of the primary should be warped and precess with the wd spin period . however , the most easily observable effect is the direct interaction of the mass stream from the secondary with the rotating magnetosphere of the wd . the changing inclination of the magnetic axis with respect to the stream produces a periodic modulation of the accretion rate onto the polar caps . in this way",
    "@xmath40 results as the beat period between the orbital and the rotational one ( @xmath2 ) .    following this scenario",
    ", we should also look for other optical orbital sidebands like @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we find that    * @xmath60 ; * @xmath61 , between @xmath62 and @xmath63 ; * @xmath64 .",
    "the latter , low frequency value corresponds to the time length of our observations , and is therefore not detectable .",
    "however , we note that a peak of minor significance at roughly 8.6 d@xmath65 is present in the power spectrum published by retter & lipkin .    taking a different approach",
    ", we might try to interprete the observed secondary periods in terms of inhomogeneities in the disc .",
    "we therefore compute their keplerian radii ( table [ radper ] ) and look for correlations with those radii where matter streams are in resonance with the tidal action by the secondary .",
    "table [ disc ] lists the main critical radii of the accretion disc for dynamical stability of orbiting matter streams .",
    "radii labeled as @xmath66 refer to resonances between the radial excursion of a test particle and the position of the secondary star @xcite .",
    "periods @xmath43 and @xmath45 would indicate keplerian radii @xmath44 and @xmath46 which are close to resonance radii @xmath51 , where superhumps are thought to be produced , and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath47 is about @xmath67 and could be its second harmonic .",
    "if we assume that , in its steady quiescent state , the nova is a synchronous rotator and take @xmath2 as the spin period of the wd , then @xmath42 should coincide with the alfven radius . however , this would suggest keplerian orbits beyond the last stable orbit of the disc @xmath53 , and no disc could form at all . as a result ,",
    "if we assume that some disc does presently exist , then rw umi , in its post - outburst state , can not be a syncronous rotator .    in order to have a standard disc ,",
    "the stream from the secondary should be able to penetrate the magnetosphere of the primary down to the circularization radius @xmath49 .",
    "our data do not give us any clear indication about what the inner radius of the disc can be .",
    "however , we might reasonably assume that some material is presently orbiting around the wd at least between radii @xmath44 and @xmath51 which accounts for the probable presence of superhumps .      in the previous subsection",
    "we have tentatively assumed @xmath2 as the spin period of the wd .",
    "if its keplerian radius , @xmath42 , is also the alfven radius for the stream , @xmath68 , then , as @xmath69 , no disc can form .",
    "however , it appears plausible that a sort of an equilibrium status , with no disc formation , might have been achieved by the fainter pre - nova , while the stream was carrying only @xmath70 . using equations ( 6.5 ) and ( 7.6 ) from warner we may write @xmath71 thus , within our hypothesis we derive @xmath72 , or , consequently ,",
    "@xmath73 g.    the post - nova is however brighter than the pre - nova .",
    "again we use equation ( [ mu_eq ] ) to derive @xmath74 for the high state of the nova , characterized by @xmath75 , which would account for yielding @xmath76 mag .",
    "we find that the stream can now penetrate the magnetosphere down to a radius @xmath77 this radius is probably not close enough to the circularization radius to allow for the formation of a standard disc , but material can finally penetrate the magnetosphere ensuring stable accretion and also the formation of a probably chaotic disc .",
    "note that the resonance radii of table [ disc ] are now populated by streaming gas .",
    "all intermediate polars have @xmath78 , so they are asynchronous rotators .",
    "the gas between the inner disc radius and the corotation radius might be rather turbulent and instability phenomena at the resonance radii could be enhanced .    in conclusion",
    ", if we assume @xmath2 as the spin period of the wd , we find that rw umi in its steady quiescent state should be a discless intermediate polar , while in its post - outburst state it appears as an intermediate polar with a somewhat unstable truncated accretion disc .",
    "the magnetic moment of the primary @xmath79 is rather large for short orbital period intermediate polars .",
    "rw umi should then tend with time to go back to a pure discless state .",
    "1 .   we have presented new photometric time - series of the old nova rw umi .",
    "2 .   the data revealed the presence of several suborbital periods .",
    "the most stable one of these is @xmath80 min , which is detected in all data sets .",
    "we find that @xmath40 agrees well with a beat period between our period @xmath81 min and the period found by retter & lipkin @xmath16 = 85 min , which is assumed to be very close to the orbital period .",
    "the most probable explanation for the presence of @xmath2 is that it represents the spin period of the white dwarf .",
    "the other suborbital periods can then be found as being optical orbital sidebands with respect to @xmath2 and/or correspond to keplerian resonance radii .",
    "4 .   assuming a mixture of ` disc ' and ` magnetic ' periods we find that rw umi , in its post - nova state , must be an asynchronous intermediate polar , as the keplerian radius of the assumed spin period @xmath2 , i.e. the alfven radius , is larger than the circularization radius .",
    "5 .   comparing the mass - transfer rates from the pre- and the post - nova",
    ", we conclude that rw umi in its quiescent , i.e.  pre - nova , state is a discless intermediate polar .",
    "one of us ( f.t . ) wishes to thank the department of astronomy of the university of padova for the kind hospitality .",
    "this work has been supported by nsf reu grant ast 9732039 , and by the italian murst ."
