    "over the last years , effective field theory ( eft ) methods have become the standard tool to deal with strong interactions in the non - perturbative regime . in the form of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , they have been used with some success in both the mesonic and single nucleon sectors .",
    "the eft of nuclear forces based on a chiral expansion was originally suggested by weinberg  @xcite , and since then a lot of work has been devoted to gain a better understanding of the two - nucleon interaction at low and intermediate energies  @xcite@xcite .",
    "while at the beginning , these studies did not aim at substituting the highly successful _ realistic _",
    "potentials built from meson exchanges ( bonn - jlich , nijmegen , argonne , @xmath1 potentials ) , the importance of uncovering such an eft can not be ignored , since this theory will allow for rigorous calculations of both elastic and inelastic processes in systems with two or more nucleons , in a framework consistent with the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions .",
    "furthermore , the latter eft works provide an accurate description of nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) phase - shifts for several partial waves and in a wide range of energies  @xcite .",
    "weinberg s original proposal was to determine the nn potentials using the organizational principles of chpt and then to insert these potentials into the lippman - schwinger equation ( lse ) to solve for nn scattering amplitudes .",
    "though such a scheme has proved to be successful  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , it suffers from formal inconsistencies , in particular , divergences that arise at a given order in the chiral expansion can not be absorbed by terms of the same order in the lagrangian  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the trouble arises , since weinberg s power counting assumes that the coefficients of the higher order operators were set by a _ typical _ quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) scale , but in practice it turns out that there appear explicit @xmath2 factors ( being @xmath2 the nucleon mass ) in the needed counter - terms to renormalize the amplitudes , which formally decrease the degree of the operator in the weinberg s counting .",
    "this was partially solved by kaplan , savage and wise ( ksw ) who introduced a new scheme where pions are treated perturbatively  @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that the ksw expansion converges slowly in the @xmath0 ( @xmath3 ) channel and does not converge at all in the @xmath4@xmath5 coupled channels  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "very recently , a so called _ expansion about the chiral limit _ has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which seems to be equivalent to ksw power counting in the @xmath0 channel and to weinberg power counting in the @xmath4@xmath5 coupled channels .    in this work",
    "we adopt the following point of view . for a scattering process involving external momenta @xmath6 , one should only consider a lagrangian / potential which explicitly includes light degrees of freedom for which @xmath7 .",
    "the effects of heavy virtual particles appear as an infinite number of non - renormalizable operators suppressed by some mass scale relevant to the degrees of freedom excluded from the theory . at low - intermediate momenta , below twice the pion mass",
    ", it should be enough to include explicitly one - pion - exchange , and simulate the rest of the physical contributions by a tower on non - renormalizable contact interactions , organized as a derivative expansion . given a potential , which includes contact terms up to some order , the lse performs an infinite sum of diagrams , which in general would require to be renormalized .",
    "after renormalization the coefficients of the contact terms would contain , in general , contributions from all orders in @xmath8 ( pion mass ) .",
    "most of the formal problems appearing within the weinberg s scheme are linked to the use of a somehow restrictive scheme to renormalize the lse  @xcite@xcite .",
    "such a restricted conception of the renormalization of the lse would also lead to unexpected consequences in other scenarios , as for example @xmath9 scattering in the @xmath10channel  @xcite . among the abundant literature on the subject , the framework presented in ref .",
    "@xcite constitutes a first step towards the renormalization scheme proposed in this work .",
    "there , a subtracted lse is derived , and the numerical values of the fitted low energies constants ( lec s ) are not translated to values for any ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff .    the aim of this paper is to present a renormalization scheme of the lse for nn scattering by a combination of known long - range and unknown short - range potentials .",
    "for simplicity , we restrict the discussion to the @xmath0 channel , where we show that the proposed scheme describes phase - shifts up to center of mass ( cm ) nucleon momenta of the order of 260 mev .",
    "this renormalization scheme is based on previous findings on @xmath9  @xcite and meson - baryon scattering  @xcite@xcite , it leads to renormalized amplitudes which fulfill exact elastic unitarity , and it is easily generalized to study higher waves and/or number of derivatives in the contact part of the interaction .",
    "after projecting into the @xmath0 partial wave , the nn lse for a cm nucleon kinetic energy @xmath11 , reads : @xmath12 with @xmath13 mev the nn reduced mass , for which we take that of the neutron - proton system , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the initial and final relative momenta of the two nucleons , and @xmath16 the @xmath0 nn potential .",
    "the normalization of the scattering amplitude @xmath17 is such that on the mass shell , @xmath18 , it is related to the phase shifts , @xmath19 , by : @xmath20 the potential consists of the one - pion - exchange potential,@xmath21 , plus contact terms,@xmath22 , with up to two derivatives  @xcite : @xmath23 with @xmath24 , @xmath25 mev and @xmath26 mev the pion mass and weak decay constant and finally @xmath27 the axial coupling constant .",
    "note that the contact term includes the @xmath28 contribution from one pion exchange , and it also does the leading and sub - leading contributions in the derivative expansion of all shorter distance effects , such as two pion exchange ( tpe ) , tpe contributions would have to be treated in the same footing as the one - pion exchange ones . ] , intermediate @xmath29 s , @xmath30 exchange , etc @xmath1 .",
    "such a procedure suffers from some limitations , for instance , since the tpe potential has not been explicitly included one can not relate nn scattering to other processes as pion - nucleon , pion - deuterium , etc  scattering .",
    "the lec s @xmath31 and @xmath32 are not fixed by chiral symmetry and have to be determined by a fit to the phase shifts , as we will see below .",
    "scattering by short - range interactions in the presence of a known long - range potential,@xmath21 , can be treated by distorted wave theory ( dwt )  @xcite .",
    "we write the full scattering matrix as wave and taking into account that do not lead to uv divergences , in what follows we will assume that the measure in momentum space and the free nucleon propagator are given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . ]",
    "@xmath35 with @xmath36 the identity , @xmath37 the free nucleon green function and @xmath38 the scattering matrix for @xmath21 alone .",
    "besides , @xmath39 describes the scattering between distorted waves of @xmath21 .",
    "it satisfies the lse @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the nucleon green function in the presence of @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath42 . to solve the lse of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dwt ] ) , the full off - shell scattering matrix @xmath43 is required , which is determined by solving the lse of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lsedef ] ) with the obvious substitution of @xmath44 .",
    "this equation is finite ( it corresponds to the scattering by the usual yukawa force studied in most books of quantum mechanics ) and does not require to be renormalized , being then possible a numerical evaluation .",
    "we have obtained @xmath38 by discretizing the momentum space and using the inverse matrix algorithm .",
    "some results are shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1s0 ] . to obtain @xmath45 ,",
    "we solve @xmath46 the above equation can be reduced to a linear algebraic system of equations , which solution is straightforward , @xmath47 with the energy dependent functions @xmath48 the uv divergent integrals @xmath49 are defined by : @xmath50 and the pair of integers @xmath51 take the values ( 2,2),(4,2 ) and ( 4,4 ) for the @xmath52 and 4 cases respectively .",
    "we use the dimensional regularization ( dr ) scheme , since it preserves chiral and gauge symmetry and galilean invariance , which makes the integrals relatively simple to evaluate .",
    "dr discards all power - law divergences of the type @xmath53 , which makes finite all the @xmath54 integrals define above , @xmath55 to simplify the @xmath56 integrals it is useful to realize that in dr the linearly uv divergent integral @xmath57 is finite ( @xmath58 ) and independent of @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "making use of the lse satisfied by @xmath38 to get expressions involving the above integral , the @xmath59 and @xmath60 integrals can be related to the @xmath61 one , @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "besides , @xmath64 is logarithmically divergent and it only requires one subtraction , i.e. , @xmath65 is finite and can be numerically evaluated .",
    "plugging eq .",
    "( [ eq : short ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : dwt ] ) one gets for the on - shell scattering amplitude @xmath66 : @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 the long and short range on - shell matrices and @xmath70 the integral @xmath71 is finite and the uv divergent integral @xmath72 in dr becomes finite , i.e. , @xmath73 @xmath74 . with all above results one gets @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "elastic unitarity is exactly fulfilled thanks to a watson s type relation satisfied by @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath78 .",
    "] , @xmath79 and that @xmath80 indeed , the on shell scattering matrix , @xmath81 , can be re - written in a form where unitarity is manifest , @xmath82 above threshold , the function @xmath83 is real , and @xmath84 are the phase shifts deduced from @xmath68 .",
    "the functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 and the phase shifts @xmath87 are plotted in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1s0 ] .",
    "note that in the complex @xmath11 plane , @xmath83 does not have right - hand - cut , but it does have a left - hand - cut due to pion exchange . before going ahead",
    "we should study how to get rid of the uv divergences .",
    "the dr scheme has led to a drastic reduction of uv divergences and thus we are just left with the logarithmic divergent integral is given by the integral @xmath88]:@xmath89 , which should be absorbed into a redefinition of the coupling constants of the potential , provided one included in the potential all terms consistent with the symmetry principles .",
    "however , the amplitude can not be made finite by simply redefining the couplings @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this problem arises because we have not included operators with more than two derivatives in the potential , which are needed as counter - terms to render multiple insertions of the two derivative operator finite .",
    "indeed , the divergent constant @xmath89 appears in the function @xmath83 defined above , and it seems natural to define a renormalized contact potential @xmath90 which leads to an infinite series of powers of @xmath91 for @xmath92 . since the lse performs a non - perturbative resummation of diagrams , in principle one should also add a series of counter - terms to the bare amplitude such that the sum of both becomes finite . at each order in the @xmath91 ( or derivative )",
    "expansion , the divergent part of the counter - term series is completely determined .",
    "however , the finite part remains arbitrary .",
    "it means that the coefficients of each of the terms in the @xmath91 series , implicit in the definition of @xmath93 , become undetermined and have to be fitted to data or , if possible , evaluated in qcd .",
    "thus , the scenario might look like pessimistic , and because of the appearance of divergences , @xmath83 turns out to be a completely undetermined function .",
    "this situation has some resemblances to chpt in the meson - meson and meson - baryon sectors . for simplicity ,",
    "let us pay attention to elastic @xmath94 @xmath9 scattering .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the divergences arising at one loop , @xmath95 , can not be absorbed into a redefinition of the leading terms , @xmath96 , of the lagrangian .",
    "new counter - terms , @xmath97 , higher in the chiral expansion are needed to absorb the divergences , which finite parts @xmath98 , remains undetermined , can not be fixed by chiral symmetry and have to be fitted to data .",
    "these lec s are fundamental parameters of the eft , which contain the contribution at low energies of higher degrees of freedom , which have been integrated out .",
    "the evaluation of the divergent parts of the amplitudes with an uv cut - off does not necessarily provide a reasonable estimate for them is employed , the @xmath99 contributions in all isospin - angular momentum elastic @xmath9 scattering channels will be determined just by one parameter , @xmath100 , while at this order there are four independent parameters , @xmath101 , which , for instance , incorporate the effect of the @xmath102 and other resonances in the amplitudes ( see for instance discussion in section 3 ( pages 6370 ) of second entry of ref .",
    "] . to be predictive , one can adopt here a renormalization scheme , similar to that used in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite to renormalize the bethe salpeter equation for meson - meson and meson - baryon scattering , which reduces the enormous freedom discussed above .",
    "since for small momenta , higher derivative operators should have a tiny influence , we choose to reduce all this proliferation of lec s , by imposing relations , among all lec s associated to counter - terms with a number of derivatives higher than the terms included in the potential , in such a way that the renormalized amplitude can be cast , again , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t_res ] ) and therefore it fulfills elastic unitarity .",
    "this amounts in practice , to interpret the previously divergent quantity @xmath89 as a renormalized undetermined parameter . after having renormalized",
    ", we add a superscript @xmath103 to differentiate between the previously divergent , @xmath104 , and now finite quantity , @xmath105 , etc ... , contributions to that of the @xmath106 one ( note that , the @xmath106 contribution shows up at the one - loop level induced by contact terms quadratic in momenta : @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) , which is determined by @xmath109 .",
    "the relation is such that elastic unitarity is restored , and thus this scheme differs from those where the higher order terms are set to zero . indeed , setting to zero the higher order terms is as arbitrary as setting them to any other value . at next order in this derivative expansion , it is to say when terms of the type @xmath110 , @xmath111 or @xmath112 are included explicitly in the potential , the lse would generate terms of order @xmath113 and higher in the amplitude .",
    "thus , the expansion based on this renormalization scheme is systematically improvable .",
    "] , @xmath114 .",
    "this parameter and therefore the renormalized amplitude can be expressed in terms of physical ( measurable ) magnitudes .",
    "the estimate given by means of a _",
    "reasonable _ uv cut - off for the numerical value of @xmath114 might not be good .",
    "for instance , eqs .",
    "( a15 ) of second entry of ref .",
    "@xcite illustrate this point , if an uv cutoff is employed , the divergent integrals appearing there will be independent of the @xmath115 channel , and to get a reasonably value for @xmath116 unrealistic scales or cut - offs of the order of 300 gev will be needed .",
    "this is due to the special nature of the @xmath102-resonance , and that is not the case , for instance , for the @xmath117waves .",
    "thus , we are proposing an expansion of the short range part of the potential in powers of @xmath91 , i.e. , delta function and its derivatives in coordinate space , and for a given potential , to compute @xmath81 to all orders in the @xmath91 expansion to restore exact unitarity .",
    "thus , the contact terms effectively account for degrees of freedom higher than the pion and one should expect the scheme to work up to the first threshold , likely two pion production ( @xmath118 ) , which is around the normal nuclear matter fermi momentum .",
    "a word of caution must be said here ; this expansion is not equivalent to a chiral expansion in @xmath8 , since the coefficients of the contact interaction would contain contributions from all orders in @xmath8 , as it was firstly pointed out in ref .",

    "@xcite , and data for momenta above the vertical line ( 260 mev ) have not been included in the fit.,height=521 ]    after the above discussion , it is clear we have three undetermined lec s : @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath125 , which we obtain from a @xmath126 fit to nijmegen phase - shifts  @xcite . to perform the fits , we assume errors on the phase shifts , @xmath19 ( in degrees ) , given by @xmath127\\right)/100 $ ] , where @xmath128 is the kinetic energy in the laboratory frame .",
    "we fit data from threshold up to a certain value , @xmath129 , of the cm nucleon momentum .",
    "we determine @xmath129 , by studying the dependence of @xmath130 on it , and fix it in the region of 260 mev , since the inclusion of simply a new datum of higher energy would double the value of @xmath130 .",
    "thus , we have fitted 62 phase shift values for which @xmath128 has varied from 0.01 to 142 mev , and results are shown ( solid line ) in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1s0 ] .",
    "best fit parameters are @xmath131 with @xmath132 . in the above equation ,",
    "statistical errors have been shown in brackets , affect to the last digit of the parameters and are given by the square root of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix , @xmath133_{ij}$ ] , with @xmath134 any of the three fitted parameters .",
    "it is worth to mention that from the above matrix , one also learns that the pairs @xmath135 and @xmath136 are highly anticorrelated , with correlation coefficients ( @xmath137 ) smaller than @xmath138 .",
    "this means that effectively there is just one independent parameter .",
    "we will come back to this point below .",
    "if the derivative terms of the contact interaction are set to zero , @xmath139 , the uv divergence can be absorbed in @xmath31  @xcite and thus one is just left with one parameter , which can be fitted to data . yet , though @xmath140 , one can arbitrarily set the renormalized coefficients of the higher order terms to zero , i.e. , take @xmath141 , and fit the non - zero lec s , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , to data .",
    "both procedures are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1s0 ] , the first one leads to the scheme developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and the second one was studied for the very first time in ref .",
    "as seen in the figure , these two schemes do not work for momenta higher than 10 and 40 mev respectively , while the solid line provides a good description of data up to momenta of the order of 260 mev .",
    "indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) we have @xmath142 mev , while such ratio takes a value around of 70 mev when @xmath109 is set to zero .",
    "the scattering length , @xmath143 , and the effective range , @xmath144 , are defined from the effective range expansion , @xmath145 fitting the inverse of our amplitude , up to @xmath146 mev , to the above formula , we get @xmath147 fm and @xmath148 fm , in reasonable agreement with the nijmegen results  @xcite ( @xmath149 fm and 2.73 fm , respectively ) also obtained in this way .    to finish , we would like just to summarize the results obtained in this work .",
    "we advocate for an expansion of the short range part of the potential in powers of @xmath91 and computing @xmath81 to all orders in the @xmath91 expansion to restore exact elastic unitarity .",
    "dwt techniques and dr have been used to solve the @xmath150 nn lse with a potential , which consists of pion exchange and contact terms with up to two derivatives .",
    "the procedure of solving the lse is quite simple and an explicit expression , where exact elastic unitarity is manifest , has been given as well ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : t_res ] ) ) .",
    "a particular renormalization scheme has also been discussed .",
    "it is based on previous findings on meson - meson and meson - baryon systems and its main ingredient is to realize that an eft is not a renormalizable field theory in the sense of qcd , i.e. , with a finite number of counter - terms .",
    "thus , to keep finite the amplitude , obtained after performing the non - perturbative resummation implicit in the lse , would require , in general , the addition of an infinite set of counter - terms in the short distance potential ( @xmath91 series ) .",
    "the finite parts of the coefficients of the series would remain undetermined ( lec s ) and encode the contribution of higher degrees of freedom , not explicitly included .",
    "an uv cut - off can effectively account for this freedom only up to some momentum scale , which will depend on the terms explicitly included in the potential . for a contact potential including up to @xmath91 terms",
    ", we find a good description of phase shifts up to cm nn momenta of the order of 260 mev with the inclusion of just one additional parameter , @xmath109 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , an uv cut - off is used to regularize the amplitudes , and with reasonable values of it , in the range @xmath151 gev , a good description of data is found .",
    "note , however , that this does not have always to be the case and depends , as we mentioned above , of the physical system and of the order of the expansion included in the potential .",
    "thus , to describe the @xmath10resonance in @xmath9 scattering , one is left to deal with uv cut - off s of the order of 300 gev  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "unrealistic values of the uv cutoff are also needed to account for the @xmath152resonance in meson baryon scattering  @xcite,@xcite , but this is not the case , for instance , for the @xmath153 and @xmath154 resonances in @xmath9 scattering  @xcite or the @xmath155 resonance in meson baryon scattering  @xcite .",
    "besides , we find extremely big anticorrelations between @xmath109 and the coefficients , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , of the iterated short distance potential and among the two later ones , as well .",
    "this indicates that the higher derivative operators in the eft , generated in this scheme by the inclusion of @xmath109 , are actually highly correlated .",
    "this might support the idea that though , the higher derivative operators are controlled by a scale that diverges as @xmath156 , thanks to these high correlations , the effects that diverge with @xmath143 cancel , as it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to include more derivatives is trivial and would result , besides the left hand cut due to pion exchange and accounted for by means of @xmath38 , in a higher order _ pad _ approximant for the function @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t_res ] ) .",
    "the extension of the procedure to higher partial waves is also straightforward although cumbersome and will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
