    "multiparticle production experiments are our main source of information on multiparticle production processes in which the initial kinetic energy of two projectiles is to a large extent converted into a multitude of observed secondaries .",
    "this is especially true in the case of heavy ion collisions in which one expects the formation of a new hadronic state of matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "such processes call for some form of statistical approach , which is usually based on the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistics . on the other hand , in the case of a multiparticle production process ,",
    "conditions leading to bg statistics are satisfied only approximately at best .",
    "this is because , among other things , hadronizing systems experience strong intrinsic fluctuations and long range correlations @xcite , which can be interpreted as signals of some dynamical , nonequilibrium effects showing up@xcite .",
    "it is therefore difficult to expect the occurrence of the usual ( local ) thermal equilibrium , instead one has some kind of stationary state .",
    "it turns out that these phenomena can be incorporated , at least to some extent and without going into deeper dynamical considerations concerning the sources of such fluctuations , in the formalism of the nonextensive statistics ( which we shall apply here in the manner proposed by tsallis , see @xcite ) in the form of a more general equilibrium summarily described by a single parameter @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this parameter characterizes the corresponding tsallis entropy , @xmath3 , which in such approach replaces the usual bg entropy to which it converges for @xmath4 . because such systems are in general nonextensive , the parameter @xmath0",
    "is usually called a _ nonextensivity parameter_.",
    "such approach has been successfully applied to multiparticle production processes , both by using nonextensive versions of the respective distribution functions @xcite , or by deriving such distributions from the appropriately modified nonextensive version of the boltzmann transport equation @xcite . in both cases ,",

    "is not clear now .",
    "instead it was shown that in this case the first role of the parameter @xmath0 is to restrict the allowed phase space and @xmath8 reflects the fact that only a fraction @xmath9 ( called _ inelasticity _ ) of the initially available energy is used for the production of secondaries , the remaining @xmath10 part is to be found in the so called leading particles . as a result one gets @xmath11 distribution with @xmath12 limited to the @xmath13 region only . ]",
    "generically one has that @xcite @xmath14 where , depending on the kind of process considered , @xmath15 can be replaced by some other variable @xcite .",
    "because different observables are sensitive to different kinds of fluctuations , it is natural to expect that they are described by different values of the parameter @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "for example , single particle , one - dimensional distributions in longitudinal phase - space , like @xmath16 , are most sensitive to fluctuations of the mean multiplicity @xmath17 of secondaries @xcite and are described by the nonextensivity parameter @xmath18 of the order of @xmath19 .",
    ", with its characteristic parameter @xmath20 given by @xmath21 @xcite ( in this case one can also speak about fluctuations in the so called _ partition temperature _ @xmath22 , see @xcite .",
    "] however , distributions in transverse momenta , @xmath23 , which are believed to probe the local thermal equilibrium of the hadronizing system ( assuming that such a phenomenon indeed occurs ) and serve as a source of information on the temperature @xmath15 of the hadronizing system , are very sensitive to fluctuations of this temperature represented by the nonextensivity parameter @xmath24 @xcite : changes as small as @xmath25 already substantially affect the resultant @xmath26 spectra measures fluctuation of the temperature @xmath15 as given by the specific heat parameter @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "as such it should be inversely proportional to the volume of the interaction region , this effect is indeed observed @xcite . ]",
    "notice that data indicate that @xmath29 , i.e. , fluctuations governed by @xmath30 are dominant and therefore for the whole system @xmath31 @xcite .    among statistical approaches to the multiparticle production processes a specially important role is played by hydrodynamical models @xcite , which so far are all based on the bg statistics .",
    "the existing general nonextensive version of fluid dynamics discussed in @xcite is not suitable for applications to multiparticle production processes ( among other things because of its non covariant formulation ) .",
    "we would like to fill this gap and present a fully covariant hydrodynamical model based on @xmath0-statistics which can be applied to a multiparticle production processes , especially to relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "because of exploratory character of our paper we limit ourselves to the @xmath32 dimensional case only and confront our results with rapidity and transverse momenta distributions obtained recently at rhic leaving the most detailed studies of all aspects of available experimental data for future investigations .",
    "the hydrodynamical model of multiparticle production means , in fact , a number of separate problems connected with the consecutive steps of the collision process : the choice of initial conditions summarizing the preparatory stage of collision ( it should end in some form of local thermal equilibrium ) , the choice of equation of state ( eos ) of the quark - gluon and/or hadronic matter being equilibrated , further hydrodynamical evolution of this matter assumed to form a kind of fluid , final conversion of this fluid into observed secondaries . because dynamical factors underlying each step are different the resulting fluctuation patterns can also differ , presumably leading to the parameter @xmath0 changing during the collision process . however , in the present study we shall restrict ourself only to the case of nonextensive parameter @xmath0 remaining the same in the whole collision process .-",
    "hydrodynamical model differs substantially from previous applications of @xmath0 statistics presented in @xcite because now the local thermal equilibrium ( in its @xmath0-version ) is superimposed on the longitudinal flow .",
    "it is therefore not clear _ a priori _ which @xmath0 should enter at which step of the collision process .",
    "we plan to discuss this subject elsewhere . ]",
    "recently there is renewed interest in dissipative hydrodynamical models @xcite , which is prompted by the apparent success of hydrodynamical models in describing data obtained at rhic @xcite and by the recent calculations of transport coefficients of strongly - interacting quark - gluon system using the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "the question addressed is whether , and under which circumstances , dissipative hydrodynamics is really needed and how it should be applied .",
    "the reason is that formulation of the relativistic hydrodynamic equations for dissipative fluid , suffer from ambiguities in the form they are written @xcite , unphysical instability of the equilibrium state in the first order theory @xcite and the loss of causality in the first order equation approach @xcite , to mention a few . in this work",
    "we argue that there is a link between dissipative hydrodynamics ( @xmath33-hydrodynamics ) and nonextensive hydrodynamics ( @xmath0-hydrodynamics ) we are proposing , which we call _ nonextensive / dissipative correspondence _ ( nexdc ) . in particular , in section [ sec : meaning ] we demonstrate that it is possible to write some of the corresponding transport coefficients of the produced matter ( believed to be quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) ) as ( implicit ) functions of the _ nonextensivity parameter _ @xmath0 .",
    "the merit of using the nexdc is that one can formulate and solve the @xmath0-hydrodynamic equations of perfect nonextensive hydrodynamics ( or perfect @xmath0-hydrodynamics ) in analogous way as for the usual perfect hydrodynamics , which seems to be _ a priori _ much easier task .",
    "although this does not fully solve the problems of @xmath33-hydrodynamics , nevertheless it allows us to extend the usual perfect fluid approach ( using only one new parameter @xmath0 ) well behind its usual limits , namely toward the regions reserved for dissipative approach only .",

    "the other problem would be how to connect our @xmath0 parameter expressing fluctuations with fluctuations in all momentum observables as seen when analyzing a non - ideal liquid as it was done , for example , in @xcite .",
    "we plan to address these problems elsewhere . in any case , similarly to the fact that concept of ideal fluid is never realized in nature @xcite ( the bound of @xmath359 found in @xcite being strong argument supporting this ) , the @xmath144 case should be replaced by investigations of the @xmath0-fluid with @xmath203 .",
    "in this context the natural question arises concerning the deeper physical meaning of the @xmath0-hydrodynamic proposed here .",
    "the most important observation discussed in section [ sec : meaning ] is the apparent correspondence found between the perfect @xmath0-hydrodynamics and the usual @xmath33-hydrodynamics , which we call the nexdc correspondence .",
    "it allows calculation of transport coefficients of viscous fluid in terms of parameters of @xmath0-(ideal ) fluid , i.e. , essentially as dependent on single parameter which , as it was already stressed many times , represents summary effect of many possible dynamical factors , without entering into dynamical details ( i.e. , in a purely phenomenological way ) .",
