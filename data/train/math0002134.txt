    "we call our approach geometrical as instead of considering 6-fold integral in abstract space we consider random triangle ( rt ) inside the plane rectangle when all possible cases are explicitly apparent .",

    "+ answer is evident : zero , as any given triangle corresponds to 6 cases of full permutation of three points at vertices of the triangle .",
    "mean area of this 6 triangles , as given by ( 1 ) , is zero . +",
    "but if we take triangle as geometrical figure and if we consider an area of such a figure as positive value , then we must take absolute value of s in formula ( 1 ) and ... calculation of relevant integrals become impossible even for mathematica .",
    "so michael trott in his recent brilliant paper in mathematica journal [ 1 ] found 496 different integrals each over subregion with the same sign of @xmath1 , and then used mathematica to solve such an enormously difficult task .",
    "needless to say that m.trotts stunning skill of using mathematica is far out of scope of ordinary reader ( as me , e.g. ) , so i ve spend some three weeks in searching a more simple solution . the result is most easily get by the explicit geometrical approach .",
    "here we consider rt in square ( = right rectangle ) with side length @xmath2 .",
    "first observation is that due to points symmetry we may simplify problem by considering particular relation between points .",
    "for example , as we will do here , we may consider only case @xmath3 _ with due account of normalizing condition_. + first point ( p1 ) may take any position inside the square , so the region of integration over x1 , y1 is @xmath4 at all cases considered further .",
    "+ now we should discriminate two cases of relation between ordinates of 1st and 2nd points : 1 ) @xmath5 and 2 ) @xmath6 .      in this case ,",

    "the line @xmath11 crosses the upper side of square at the point @xmath12 with @xmath13 , see fig.1 , panel 1a .",

    " the first integral s region , region 2- , panel 1a , fig . 1 , and here formula ( 1 ) should be taken with negative sign : @xmath21 note that 2nd integral differs from 1st one only by integration boundaries over @xmath22 ( and by sign of @xmath1 ) .",
    "+ also , the interesting exact relation occurs between numerical values of two considered integrals : @xmath23 + last integral at the case @xmath24 , corresponding to region 3- , panel 1a , fig .",
    "1 , is ; @xmath25 note that all three multiple integrals have the same first four particular integral regions and we may write down them in a more compact form , but we will not do this pure  decorative  operation . + @xmath26 . in this case and still at @xmath27 , the line @xmath11 crosses the right side of square ; now the region of integration over @xmath28 is @xmath29 and we have two different regions of integration over @xmath30 : + @xmath31 @xmath32 with positive @xmath1 , region 4 + , panel 1b , fig .",
    "1,which gives @xmath33 , and + @xmath34 @xmath35 with negative @xmath1 , r. 5- .",

    "our geometrical approach is particularly explicitly demonstrate his power : it is sufficient to look at panels 1a - 1d of the fig . 1 to be convinced that actually we have only two different cases , one case when line ( p1,p2 ) crosses two opposite sides of square and second case when line ( p1,p2 ) crosses two adjacent sides of square",

    "now the line ( p1,p2 ) crosses lower side of square , panel 1d , fig . 1 , and we have in essence the case coinciding with previous one , panel 1a , fig . 1 , so we have another three integrals with values actually found before : i8=i1 , i9=i2 , and i10=i3 .",
    "+ now sum of all 10 integrals is equal to @xmath45 the normalizing coefficient is found by calculating a sum of abovementioned 10 integrals with ( + /-s)=1 in all cases which gives @xmath46 that is 1/6 of volume of hypercube with side a. so the mean area of random triangle inside the square is @xmath47 of host - figure s square , @xmath48 .",
