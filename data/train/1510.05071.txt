    "current power grid is being modernized into smart grid by enabling the integrations of advanced information and communication technologies relating power consumption and storage  @xcite . integrating new technologies to power grid",
    "enables us to control the grid in a more flexible and efficient manner .",
    "for example , two - way communication and information technologies allow the use of demand response and automatic meter reading , respectively . another important feature is to merge variable renewable energy sources such as wind , solar , and wave energy generators to the grid .",
    "it is well known that renewable energy attracts more attentions due to its cleanness and profitability .",
    "worldwide 144 countries now have their own political targets for increasing shares of renewable energy generations and especially european union targets 20% of renewable energy shares by 2020  @xcite",
    ".    however , variable renewable integration imposes challenges to operation and management of power grid . as pointed out in  @xcite , renewable energy can not be fully predicted .",
    "there are many wind forecasting methods which are well surveyed in  @xcite , but forecasting errors could be one source for uncertainties and become dominant as time horizon increases .",
    "another source of uncertainties is the increasing use of intermittent renewable energy sources in a distributed way  @xcite .",
    "even more it fluctuates fast and largely  @xcite .",
    "for example , wind power generation contains @xmath0 high frequency components  @xcite .",
    "fast changing generation of renewable energy with unknown amount of power threatens the stability of the power grid  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is difficult for a synchronous generator to track fast changing signals because it has a high inertia .      in this paper , we consider distributed frequency regulation problems in smart power grid with integration of wind power energy , demand response , and battery energy storage system ( bess ) .",
    "designed distributed controllers are expected to regulate angular frequencies to a desired common constant under fast changing and unknown wind generations . in particular",
    "we study the following two problems .",
    "the first problem is _ distributed robust frequency regulation _ with known frequencies of wind power generations .",
    "the known frequency assumption is relaxed in the second problem called _ distributed robust adaptive frequency regulation_. we propose the distributed controllers with ( adaptive ) internal model . under the proposed distributed controllers , mechanical generation and elastic load are able to completely reject unknown wind power generations , regulating network wide angular frequencies to a desired constant . to our best knowledge",
    ", there is no existing controller which achieves this performance when frequencies of wind power generations are unknown .",
    "moreover , this paper is the first time to investigate distributed adaptive internal model control .",
    "furthermore , we match the trackable frequencies of wind generations with different grid components to balance the power generations and demand .",
    "this idea is inspired by the fact that each controllers have different inertias and thus they have different ranges of trackable frequencies of signals .",
    "we first split wind power generation signals into low , medium , and high frequency parts , which is based on van der hoven s horizontal wind speed spectrum model  @xcite and trigonometric function formulas . at each bus ,",
    "a bess is interconnected with wind power generations to filter out the high frequency parts .",
    "the low and medium components are asymptotically reconstructed via a local internal model . at generator bus ,",
    "the reconstructed signals are tracked by two different controllers .",
    "mechanical power generations track the low frequency parts and elastic demands are driven by real - time prices to track the medium frequency parts . at load bus ,",
    "elastic demands track both the low and medium frequency parts of wind power .",
    "the remaining part of our solution of each problem is described as follows .",
    "_ solution 1 : robust frequency regulation .",
    "_ we first convert the global frequency regulation problem into a global stabilization problem .",
    "the augmented system at each generator bus consists of synchronous generator , demand response , and internal model .",
    "the augmented system at each load bus consists of demand response , and internal model .",
    "they are in a lower triangular structure . in the same coordinate transformation , redundant terms inspired by back - stepping",
    "are added to stabilize the system from the outer state to inner state .",
    "the state of each augmented system becomes input to state stable ( iss ) with respect to the states of neighboring augmented systems .",
    "we choose control gains such that state transition matrix be hurwitz to stabilize the networked system .",
    "it has been shown that , even when each control authorities can access to their local parameters only , the stabilizing controllers can be designed always .",
    "in this case , the control gains are designed such that local iss gain functions are contraction mappings .",
    "a newly derived distributed constrained small gain theorem ensures that the collection of local contraction mappings are sufficient for the network stability .",
    "consequently , the proposed distributed controllers with the local internal models ensure that all the states are exponentially stable with respect to the desired manifolds .",
    "_ solution 2 : robust adaptive frequency regulation .",
    "_ designing an internal model requires a constant matrix which depends on frequencies of wind power generations .",
    "the frequencies of wind generations , however , are unknown and thus it is required to estimate the matrix .",
    "we design a projected adaptive parameter estimator for this purpose .",
    "we again solve the problem by converting the frequency regulation problem into a global stabilization problem with back - stepping inspired coordinate transformation terms to make the augmented system iss with respect to the neighboring states .",
    "the proposed distributed controllers with adaptive internal model guarantee asymptotic convergence of all the states to their manifolds instead of exponential stability _",
    "solution 1 _ can guarantee .",
    "moreover , it is assumed that the synchronous generator model can be slightly simplified .",
    "this paper is enriched from our preliminary results  @xcite .",
    "first of all , we relax the known frequency assumption ; i.e. , _ solution 2_. secondly , we relax the assumption on the bus .",
    "previously , we assume that each bus must have a generator and load . to make the problem more realistic , in this paper",
    ", we consider more types of buses as shown in figure  [ type_table ] .",
    "thirdly , simulations are applied to a more complex and realistic topology .",
    "lastly , there are detailed proofs which were omitted from the preliminary results .      distributed control methods on power system",
    "have been studied extensively . primary control",
    "( droop - control ) scheme adjusts mechanical power generations to stabilize the frequencies via governors in a decentralized way  @xcite . to improve restoration of angular frequency , secondary control",
    "is introduced .",
    "secondary control ( automatic generation control ) tunes the set - point of governors to achieve nominal frequencies in a centralized way  @xcite .",
    "our control problems consider the primary and secondary controls at the same time in a distributed way under the existence of fast changing and unknown signals .",
    "there have been attempts attenuating the impact of the uncertainties induced by renewable energy , power demand , and other sources .",
    "robust control techniques include riccati equation  @xcite , @xmath1 control  @xcite , lmis  @xcite , etc .",
    "also , it was shown that oscillations induced by load disturbances can be effectively alleviated by a bess  @xcite .",
    "another way to address the uncertainties is to reject disturbances and/or asymptotically track reference signals .",
    "internal model has been widely used to achieve the goal  @xcite . on power systems , recent paper  @xcite",
    "uses internal model principle to address uncertainty induced by time varying demands .",
    "different from our work , the paper  @xcite only deals with secondary control on a simpler ( second order ) model with voltage dynamics , and guarantees regional asymptotic convergence rate assuming that frequencies of demand signals are known . only with the known frequency assumption ,",
    "our first solution guarantees global exponential convergence of the fourth order dynamics .",
    "we further extend that , with unknown frequencies , our second solution guarantees global asymptotic convergence of the third order dynamics . on top of this",
    ", we split unknown signals into three parts according to their frequency ranges to be tracked and filtered by two different controllers and bess .",
    "traditional approach to balance power demand and generation is to adjust power generations .",
    "some of recent studies focus on achieving the power balance via demand controlling such as optimal load control  @xcite , load switch  @xcite , etc .",
    "the features and overview of demand side control is well introduced in  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that load side control can be faster and have a large capacity through implementing a switching device so that such control scheme is used to assist conventional mechanical generation system  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "real - time demand response is used to track medium ( and low ) frequency parts of wind power generations at generator bus ( at load bus ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by introducing all the system models in section  [ sec : problem - formulation ] . based on the illustrated models , the two problems ; i.e.",
