    "the dispersion equation eq.([eqndeq ] ) is fundamentally similar to the dispersion of a plane wave in isotropic material .",
    "indeed , the combination @xmath24 , which plays a role of the effective index of refraction , is combined from two ( mode - dependent ) scalar quantities , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the mode propagation requires both propagation constants to be of the same sign .    while the parameter @xmath25 depends solely on the dielectric properties of the core material , the propagation parameter @xmath26 can be controlled ( through @xmath7 ) , by changing the waveguide ( or mode ) geometry . since @xmath7 is inversely proportional to the waveguide size",
    "[ see eq.([eqnkappa])]@xcite , there exists a _ cut - off radius _ @xmath27 , corresponding to @xmath28 for every free - space - like mode propagating in the waveguide with isotropic dielectric core .",
    "the modes propagate in structures with @xmath29 , and are reflected from thinner systems .",
    "this appearance of the cut - off radius in all dielectric waveguides can be considered as a manifestation of a diffraction limit  it is impossible to localize a combination of plane waves to a region much smaller than the wavelength inside the material @xmath30 , with @xmath31 being free space wavelength .",
