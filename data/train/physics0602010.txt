    "a few plasma physics problems can be solved exactly ( e.g. akhiezer and lyubarskii , 1951 ; dawson , 1959 ; davidson , 1972 ; shivamoggi , 1988 ; stenflo and yu , 1997 ) .",
    "the plasma disturbances have in those cases been allowed to be so large that no expansion techniques are applicable .",
    "the new exact solutions can be useful in interpreting observed large amplitude wave phenomena in detail , as well as for verifying new approximation schemes and numerical methods in the study of nonlinear effects .",
    "we shall in the present paper reconsider one of the simplest possible situations , namely that of one - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) oscillations in a cold plasma slab ( @xmath1 ) where the electrons are mobile , whereas the ions are immobile and form a fixed background with the constant density @xmath2 . the special case where the electron density @xmath3 is only a function of time and where the cold electron fluid velocity @xmath4 satisfies the boundary conditions @xmath5 has been solved previously ( aliev and stenflo , 1994 ; stenflo , 1996 ) . here we shall use the same boundary condition but consider a more general and useful class of solutions for @xmath6 .",
    "our governing equations are @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the electric field , @xmath9 is the magnitude of the electron charge , @xmath10 is the electron mass , and @xmath11 is the vacuum dielectric constant . by eliminating the electric field in ( [ eq : mom ] ) and ( [ eq : poisson ] ) we immediately find the equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 .    we shall below study a particular solution where @xmath6 and @xmath4 satisfy the system of two coupled equations ( [ eq : cont ] ) and ( [ eq : elim ] ) , and where @xmath14 .",
    "our boundary condition means that the electrons are always contained within the slab , and that @xmath15 accordingly is a constant ( @xmath16 ) . by means of straightforward calculations it is then easy to verify that a solution of ( [ eq : cont ] ) and ( [ eq : elim ] ) is @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is given by the implicit relation @xmath20 , \\ ] ] and the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 is an arbitrary function satisfying @xmath23 .",
    "we shall in the present paper choose the simple function @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "with this choice of @xmath26 we note that ( [ eq : x ] ) is a third order polynomial in @xmath21 , and that an analytical expression @xmath19 thus can be presented by solving @xmath27 .\\ ] ] however , here we do not give the explicit expression for @xmath19 .",
    "other choices of @xmath26 lead to more elaborate expressions for @xmath19 and will therefore not be considered .",
    "corresponding to ( [ eq : x - part ] ) , ( [ eq : density ] ) and ( [ eq : velocity ] ) now reduce to @xmath28 and @xmath29    we note that @xmath30 . with the normalization @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and",
    "@xmath35 we plot the density and velocity profiles for different times .",
    "one can then verify that the total number of electrons is conserved during the oscillations .",
    "first , when @xmath36 we show ( in the left panel of fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath6 for different normalized times @xmath37 , using @xmath38 .",
    "we note the symmetric and oscillating character of @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding velocity profile @xmath4 can be seen in the right panel of fig .  1 .",
    "for these regular oscillations , the sign of @xmath25 characterizes the initial value of the electron density @xmath39 : when @xmath40 we start with higher edge density at @xmath41 , while for @xmath42 the density has an initial spatial maximum at @xmath43 .",
    "the denominator in ( [ eq : density2 ] ) can approach zero at a finite time @xmath44 , resulting in explosive growth . due to the symmetric character of the density distribution the explosion for @xmath45",
    "will either be at ( a ) the edges of the slab ( @xmath41 , i.e.  @xmath46 ) or ( b ) at the centre of the slab ( @xmath47 , i.e.  @xmath48 ) . in the case ( a )",
    ", the explosion time @xmath44 is given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , while in case ( b ) the explosion time is found from @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "thus , in case ( b ) we can have explosive growth both at the edges and at the centre , depending on the initial conditions , while this it not necessarily true for case ( a ) .",
    "the explosive instability occurs in the wave - breaking regime , and our cold plasma model thus breaks down at this stage ( see fig .  2 ) . a change of sign of @xmath25 shifts the density distribution by half a period .",
    "note however that @xmath53 gives rise to unphysical initial conditions , i.e.  @xmath54 .",
    "in the present paper we have generalized the work of aliev and stenflo ( 1994 ) to allow for a class of solutions where the electron density @xmath6 is an explicit , and comparatively simple , function of @xmath55 .",
    "we have presented figures which show the behavior of the solutions for different initial values @xmath39 . from those solutions we can very clearly see that @xmath6 has an oscillating behavior when @xmath56 , while if @xmath50 we have explosive growth , i.e.  @xmath3 grows like @xmath57 where the explosion time @xmath44 is of the order @xmath58 .",
    "we think that the present solution can be generalized to cold many - component plasmas ( amiranashvili et al . , 2002 ) , to plasmas where @xmath2 is a function of @xmath55 ( stenflo and gradov , 1990 ; karimov , 2002 ) , to cylindrical plasmas ( stenflo and yu , 1997 ; karimov , 2005 ) , to pierce beam plasma systems ( matsumoto , yokohama , and summers , 1996 ) , as well as to other kind of plasmas ( vladimirov , yu , and tsytovich , 1994 ) .",
    "alternative solutions are of course also possible ( polyakov , 1995 )",
    ".    our governing equations are easily generalized to the relativistic case by replacing eq .",
    "( [ eq : mom ] ) by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the velocity of light , and @xmath10 is the electron rest mass . at present we have however not been able to generalize ( [ eq : density ] ) and ( [ eq : velocity ] ) to the relativistic case , and we have therefore limited our presentation to the regime @xmath62 .",
    "the opposite limit is of course also of much interest , but it has to be delegated to future numerical work ."
