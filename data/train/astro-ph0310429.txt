    "abundances of chemical elements in galaxies are commonly measured using the emission lines emitted by astrophysical nebulae ( e.g. , see osterbrock 1989 ) . recombination lines of hydrogen ( e.g. , the balmer series ) or helium and forbidden lines of singly and doubly ionized carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , neon , and sulfur are among the strongest observable lines in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum .",
    "the relative strengths of each emission line , combined with some knowledge of the temperature and density of the nebulae , provide information about the relative and absolute abundances of each ion .",
    "chemical analyses of individual nebulae have been used to test nucleosynthesis models of stars , the chemical evolutionary history of galaxies , and nucleosynthesis in the big bang ( review by aller 1990 ; pagel 1998 ) .",
    "even integrated spectra of entire galaxies may be used to estimate the overall degree of chemical enrichment of a galaxy ( kobulnicky , kennicutt , & pizagno 1998 ) .",
    "observational techniques sometimes permit the relative fluxes of emission lines from galaxies to be measured with a high degree of precision . however , in the current generation of wide - field galaxy surveys on multi - object spectrographs , flux calibration is frequently problematic due to unfavorable observing conditions or instrumental effects such as a variation in system response over the field of view . in addition , the traditional line ratio for reddening determination is @xmath8 , but for redshifts greater than @xmath9 the @xmath10 line is not available , and these galaxies rarely have sufficient signal - to - noise in their spectra to attempt a reddening derivation from the higher - order balmer lines . for such surveys , it is still desirable to extract chemical information from the data , where possible .    in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility of estimating mean gas - phase oxygen abundances for galaxies based the _ equivalent widths _ ( rather than fluxes ) of strong balmer @xmath11 recombination line and forbidden [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] emission lines .",
    "this method essentially uses the underlying stellar continuum as a crude flux calibrator , and has the advantage that any reddening affecting the stars and gas equally will be automatically removed .",
    "while we would not expect the equivalent - width method to be as accurate as the traditional method , particularly for individual objects , we find that it works sufficiently well to enable us to measure approximate oxygen abundances in relatively faint , intermediate - redshift galaxies .",
    "our approach is to develop the method from basic principles , and to test and empirically calibrate it using three spectroscopic galaxy datasets , and in the end compare the oxygen abundance indicator @xmath4 to the quantity @xmath0 derived from traditional line fluxes and flux ratios to results using only the equivalent widths and equivalent width ratios .",
    "the thesis of this paper is that even when the dereddened line _ flux _",
    "ratio @xmath4 is not available , a corresponding ratio of _ equivalent widths _ can still provide an estimate of the oxygen abundance .",
    "this new method is applied to the study of abundances in a set of intermediate - redshift galaxies observed as part of the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ( deep ) spectroscopic survey in the groth strip ( dgss ) presented in a companion paper , kobulnicky  ( 2003 ; ke03 ) .",
    "standard techniques for measuring chemical abundances in astrophysical nebulae from the fluxes and flux ratios of nebular emission lines are reviewed in osterbrock ( 1989 ) .",
    "the most direct and reliable techniques involve measuring a suite of temperature - sensitive and density - sensitive line ratios to determine the physical conditions of the plasma . in the absence of high signal - to - noise data measuring temperature  sensitive line ratios",
    "( e.g. , [ o  iii ]  @xmath124363/[o  iii ]  @xmath125007 ) , the default diagnostic for measuring the oxygen abundance of ionized nebulae has become the ratio of strong oxygen emission lines @xmath13 ( pagel  1979 ) .",
    "subsequently , many authors have developed formulations relating this strong line ratio to the gas - phase oxygen abundance ( e.g. , edmunds & pagel 1984 ; mccall , rybski & shields 1985 ; dopita & evans 1986 ; mcgaugh 1991 ) .",
    "most modern calibrations relating @xmath4 to oxygen abundance include a measure of the ionization parameter , such as @xmath14 as a second parameter ( e.g. , mcgaugh 1991 ; pilyugin 2001 ) .",
    "while the @xmath4 method was developed primarily for individual hii regions , kobulnicky , kennicutt , & pizagno ( 1998 ; kkp ) have shown that this approach is valid even when applied to the integrated spectra of galaxies as a means of estimating an average o / h abundance for the galaxy as a whole .",
    "even when the signal to noise ratio of these lines is as low as 8:1 or when a spectroscopic observation encompasses a range of metallicities and ionization conditions within a galaxy , this ratio provides a rough , but reliable , estimate of the mean gas - phase oxygen abundance when used in conjunction with the appropriate calibration relating @xmath4 to @xmath15 . at this signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "the associated uncertainty on the oxygen abundance due to line measurement error is typically comparable to the uncertainty due to the calibration of the @xmath4 vs. o / h relationship : @xmath16 dex . in this paper",
    "we show that the uncertainty introduced by substituting emission line equivalent widths is less than these other sources of uncertainty , and thereby establish a new method for measuring interstellar medium oxygen abundances .",
    "the original @xmath4 method involves line ratios , so we consider the effects of using equivalent width ratios in place of flux ratios . for generality , we include the effects of reddening in the discussion , assuming the traditional `` screen '' model .",
    "the equivalent width can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 represents the line flux and @xmath19 is the underlying continuum flux .",
    "the fluxes do not need to be calibrated , since the calibration affects both quantities equally .",
    "the dereddened , calibrated flux value for a line , @xmath20 , or continuum , @xmath21 , is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the logarithmic attenuation at @xmath11 and @xmath24 is a function describing the reddening curve ( see seaton 1979 ) . combining these leads to a general line ratio formulation of @xmath25 where we group all the continuum and reddening terms into the factor @xmath26 .",
    "note that the continuum will be attenuated by an amount characterized by @xmath27 , and reddened by ( presumably ) the same reddening law .",
    "thus , @xmath28    the factor @xmath26 contains two unknowns , the ratio of the non - reddened continuum fluxes , which depends on the underlying stellar population , and the difference in the attenuation of the emitting gas and the continuum light .",
    "note that values of @xmath23 can range from zero to quite large for individual hii regions , although large values are severely deweighted in the average over an entire galaxy .",
    "typical derived values are in the range 0 to 1 , with a median value around 0.3 ( mccall  1985 ; olofsson 1995 ) .",
    "values of @xmath27 can be estimated from the relation @xmath29 from seaton . for @xmath30 in a typical range of 00.2 , @xmath31 00.3 . in physically realistic situations",
    ", we would expect some correlation of @xmath23 and @xmath27 , and also that ( @xmath32 ) @xmath33 0 .",
    "let us now consider the specific line ratios of interest for the @xmath4 method .",
    "the first is @xmath34 . for the purposes of reddening correction",
    ", we adopt the wavelength of the stronger [ o  iii ] @xmath125007 line .",
    "the value of @xmath26 in this case is    @xmath35    due to the proximity of these emission lines in wavelength , we expect the flux ratios of the underlying stellar population to be very close to unity .",
    "similarly , for realistic @xmath36 , the reddening factor will be between unity and 0.92 .",
    "thus , for this line ratio , @xmath37 , and we will ignore it in further discussion . to a very good approximation ,",
    "@xmath38    the second ratio , @xmath39 , is more problematic ; for these lines , @xmath40 in principle , we could estimate @xmath41 from a detailed spectral analysis of the flux - calibrated , integrated stellar spectrum and balmer line ratios , but for faint , galaxies with redshifts @xmath42 we will have neither the signal - to - noise nor access to the h@xmath26 line in order to do this . in practice , we need to adopt an appropriate average value of @xmath41 determined by other means .",
    "galaxy light tends to be dominated by a main sequence and g and k giants ( e.g. , morgan & mayall 1957 ; pritchet 1977 ; kobulnicky & gebhardt 2000 ) , and assuming an underlying stellar spectrum composed of a linear combination of these two spectral types implies that the dereddened flux ratio of the continuum ranges from @xmath431 for late - b stars to @xmath430.4 for mid - g giants to @xmath430.2 for early - k giants ( although galaxies whose @xmath123727 flux is dominated by k stars is unlikely to have any line emission from star formation ) .",
    "examining the spectra in kennicutt ( 1992b ) shows the @xmath123727-to-@xmath124861 ratio of the continuum fluxes in galaxies with obvious emission lines ranging from @xmath430.41.0 ; if these were dereddened the range would shift upwards and might possibly narrow somewhat .    on the other hand ,",
    "the reddening correction ranges from 1 to 1.8 for realistic values @xmath44 , with a typical likely difference @xmath45 giving a reddening factor of @xmath431.2 . combining the reddening and stellar population factors leads to an expected value of @xmath46 .",
    "this expected average value for @xmath41 differs from unity by less than 0.1 dex .",
    "we find the @xmath4 measure can now be expressed @xmath47 not surprisingly , the @xmath4 measured using equivalent widths and an adopted average value for @xmath41 will be most in error when [ o  ii ] dominates [ o  iii ] .",
    "the final line ratio of interest is the ionization parameter , and it is easy to see that @xmath48 the value @xmath49 to a very good approximation , so at this point we will drop the subscripts and simply refer to `` @xmath26 '' for either of these quantities . comparing the ratios above is probably the easiest means to empirically estimate an average value for @xmath26 .",
    "while it would be equally valid to estimate @xmath26 from the [ o  ii ] and h@xmath3 ratios , the h@xmath3 equivalent width can be contaminated by underlying stellar absorption .",
    "in order to empirically measure an average value of @xmath26 and to confirm the validity of using equivalent width line ratios in estimating @xmath4 , we compiled three sets of emission - line spectra of nearby galaxies .",
    "the first set consists of 16 objects with spatially - integrated spectra from the 55-object spectroscopic galaxy atlas of kennicutt ( 1992a , b ; k92 ) plus six additional emission - line objects from kkp .",
    "we refer to this sample as the k92 + sample .",
    "the k92 + spectra are produced by drifting a longslit across each galaxy and have spectral resolutions of 5 - 7   ( k92 ) and 3   ( kkp ) .",
    "the 16 k92 galaxies in our subsample are the strongest emission - line objects where global metallicity measurements are possible .",
    "the full set of k92 galaxies represents a range of morphological types from sa to i m , but it includes only the bright galaxies of each type .",
    "the kkp galaxies are all underluminous , dwarf emission - line galaxies . for a second local sample , we examined the 198-galaxy nearby field galaxy survey ( jansen  2000a , b ; nfgs ) , which is selected from the cfa redshift catalog ( huchra  1983 ) . from this spatially - integrated spectroscopic survey , we culled 98 objects with measurable @xmath11 , [ o  iii ] and [ o  ii ] emission lines .",
    "these spectra have a resolution of 6   and include a larger range of luminosity ( @xmath50 ) and surface brightnesses than k92 + while spanning morphological types .",
    "the k92 + objects have a higher fraction of star - forming galaxies ( objects with strong emission lines ) compared to the nfgs sample . as a third local sample , we used emission - line selected galaxies in the kitt peak national observatory spectroscopic survey ( kiss ; salzer  2000 )",
    ". kiss is a large - area objective prism survey of local ( @xmath51 ) galaxies selected by strong @xmath10 emission , and thus , preferentially contains objects with active star formation . while high - quality slit spectroscopy has been obtained for @xmath43519 kiss galaxies ( melbourne & salzer 2002 ) , 396 galaxies lack [ o  ii ] measurements , leaving 123 galaxies .",
    "these remaining spectra have 58   resolution , and are analyzed in salzer  ( 2003 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the 22 k92 + , 98 nfgs , and 123 kiss galaxies were selected from their larger parent samples because of strong emission lines suitable for nebular metallicity measurement .",
    "following kkp , we chose only galaxies with detectable [ o  ii]@xmath123727 , [ o  iii]@xmath124959 , [ o  iii]@xmath125007 , and h@xmath3 emission lines .",
    "only galaxies where all four emission lines were measured with a s / n of 8:1 or greater were retained .",
    "this selection criterion preferentially includes galaxies with high equivalent width lines , but it also includes galaxies with low equivalent width lines where the continuum is smooth and well - measured .    for each galaxy in the k92 + sample we measured the emission - line fluxes and equivalent widths manually using gaussian fits . for the nfgs and kiss surveys , we adopted the published emission - line fluxes and equivalent widths .",
    "dereddened emission - line fluxes were computed for all three samples by comparing the observed @xmath52 ratios to theoretical ratios .",

    "here we assumed fixed electron temperature of 12,000 k so that @xmath53 = 2.85 .",
    "] the line fluxes are dereddened using the law of seaton ( 1979 ) as parameterized by howarth ( 1983 ) and as described in kobulnicky & skillman ( 1996 ) .",
    "we did not correct the balmer emission lines for underlying stellar absorption .",
    "the effects of balmer absorption by the stellar population are discussed in section  5.3    while the k92+kkp sample consists entirely of starforming galaxies , several low - level agn are known to exist in the nfgs .",
    "these four objects are not included in the our subsample .",
    "the 123 kiss galaxies included here do not contain any agn , as they were selected to be conventional starforming galaxies based on analysis high - quality spectroscopic observations ( salzer 2003 ) . in any case , the presence of agn among the samples would not have a significant bearing on the results of this paper since we are interested in comparing observable properties of emission lines rather than deriving physical quantities such as density or metallicity which are sensitive to the nature of the ionizing source .",

    "when we correct for this in a reasonable fashion , we do not see a significant reduction in the scatter , so we must assume the scatter due to some other reason .",

    "the upper left panel of figure  [ ewtest4 ] compares the `` raw '' @xmath0 ratio with the quantity @xmath88 ; the correlation is modest , with a dispersion of @xmath89 dex and a systematic offset of 0.06 dex .",
    "the lower panels illustrate the nature of the residuals as a function of galaxy color and line strengths .",
    "as might be expected , galaxies with the lowest @xmath61 are the most deviant , while galaxies with @xmath90 show a much smaller dispersion .",
    "a more logical approach is also to add a correction to @xmath61 for the underlying stellar absorption , forming a new quantity @xmath91 .",
    "a 2   correction to @xmath61 was chosen because it was the mean correction needed to produce @xmath88 , and is consistent with mean corrections found for other galaxies ( e.g. , mccall 1985 ; olofsson 1995 ) .",
    "the right top panel shows @xmath91 plotted against @xmath88 .",
    "the residuals are now much smaller with @xmath92 dex and a systematic offset of less than 0.01 dex . in the absence of direct measurements of the balmer absorption due to stellar populations ,",
    "application of a 2 blanket correction to @xmath61 appears to be prudent for the types of starforming galaxies in the k92 + , dgss and kiss samples .",
    "samples including galaxies with older stellar populations may require larger corrections .",
    "the ratios of the equivalent widths of strong oxygen and hydrogen emission lines from the ionized component of distant galaxies can be used as a measure of the global ism metallicity via the substitution of @xmath0 for @xmath4 .",
    "we recommend the use of @xmath91 where the @xmath61 has been corrected for stellar balmer absorption assuming a mean correction of 2  . the typical dispersion from the 1-to-1 relation between either @xmath0 or @xmath91 and the canonical reddening and absorption - corrected @xmath4 ratio is @xmath93 dex .",
    "residuals are somewhat smaller ( @xmath94 dex ) for galaxies with the largest emission - line equivalent widths ( i.e. , those having the largest rates of star formation per unit luminosity ) .",
    "the translation of these errors into errors in oxygen abundance will depend on the value of @xmath4 , but for the upper - metallicity branch away from the `` turnaround '' point , the slope of log(o / h ) vs log(@xmath4 ) is @xmath431.4 ( pilyugin 2001 ) , so the addition error in log(o / h ) would be @xmath430.11 dex .",
    "thus , the additional uncertainty introduced by translating a set of measured equivalent widths into the traditional @xmath4 flux ratio diagnostic is comparable to or less than the typical observational line measurement uncertainties and systematic errors in the @xmath4 to o / h calibration which run 0.15 dex in o / h ( e.g. , kobulnicky , kennicutt & pizagno 1999 for a more detailed discussion of the error budget ) .",
    "we anticipate that the method tested here will be useful for performing rough chemical abundance estimates in large high - redshift galaxy samples .",
    "the approach described here will be most useful in a statistical sense when large numbers of objects are available for study .",
    "possible applications include understanding the overall chemical evolution of star forming galaxies over large intervals of cosmic time ( kobulnicky  2003 ) or assessing the impact of cluster environment and the intracluster medium on the chemical properties of the ism within galaxies ( e.g. , skillman  1996 ) .",
