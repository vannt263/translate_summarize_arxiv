    "the nucleosynthesis of so - called @xmath5-nuclei on the neutron - deficient side of the chart of nuclides requires a huge reaction network including more than 1000 nuclei and more than 10000 nuclear reactions ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting production factors depend sensitively on branchings between ( @xmath3,n )  and ( @xmath3,@xmath0 )  reactions which are located several mass units `` north - west '' of stability on the chart of nuclides for heavy nuclei and close to stability for nuclei in the mass range around @xmath6 .",
    "it is impossible to measure all the required ( @xmath3,@xmath0 )  reaction rates in the laboratory . instead",
    ", theoretical predictions have been used which are based on statistical model ( stm ) calculations . in most cases",
    "it turns out that the ( @xmath3,@xmath0 )  reaction rate is better constrained by experimental ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  data than by ( @xmath3,@xmath0 )  data because of the strong influence of thermally excited states in the target nucleus @xcite .",
    "calculations of ( @xmath3,@xmath0 )  and ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross sections and reaction rates depend on the @xmath0  transmission which in turn depends on the chosen @xmath0-nucleus potential .",
    "angular distributions of ( @xmath0,@xmath0 )  elastic scattering have been measured with high precision in the last decade @xcite to determine the @xmath0-nucleus potential at low energies . however , elastic scattering at low energies is dominated by the coulomb interaction , and the angular distributions approach the rutherford cross section for point - like charges at astrophysically relevant energies .",
    "consequently , @xmath0-nucleus potentials from elastic scattering are determined at somewhat higher energies and have to be extrapolated down to the astrophysically relevant energies .",
    "it has turned out over the years that standard @xmath0-nucleus potentials like the extremely simple mcfadden - satchler potential @xcite are able to reproduce ( @xmath0,n )  and ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross sections around and above the coulomb barrier , whereas at very low energies below the coulomb barrier ( i.e. , in the astrophysically relevant energy range ) an increasing overestimation of the experimental reaction cross sections has been found in many cases ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , in the @xmath7 mass range , experimental ( @xmath0,p )  and ( @xmath0,n )  data are well described using the mcfadden - satchler potential @xcite .",
    "several alternative suggestions for low - energy @xmath0-nucleus potentials have been made in the last years in @xcite , and the related uncertainties of @xmath0-induced reaction cross sections at low energies were studied very recently by @xcite .",
    "the motivation of the present work is manyfold .",
    "firstly , we attempt to extend the high - precision elastic scattering measurements of the last decade in the mass range @xmath8 @xcite towards lower masses . secondly , we include inelastic ( @xmath0,@xmath9 )  scattering into our analysis which may play a significant role for the total ( non - elastic ) reaction cross section @xmath1  at very low energies @xcite .",
    "thirdly , we have measured reaction cross sections of the ( @xmath0,n ) , ( @xmath0,p ) , and ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  reactions at exactly the same energy as ( @xmath0,@xmath0 )  elastic and inelastic scattering .",
    "this avoids any complications from the extrapolation of the energy - dependent @xmath0-nucleus potential . in our previous study @xcite",
    "such experimental data have been used for a sensitive test of the basic quantum - mechanical equation which relates the total reaction cross section @xmath1  to the reflexion coefficients @xmath10 of elastic scattering . in the present work",
    "the reduced experimental uncertainties allow to use the quantum - mechanical relation for @xmath1  to constrain the cross sections of unobserved non - elastic channels .",
    "note that the chosen target nucleus @xmath2zn  is well - suited for such a study because most of the reaction products of @xmath0-induced reactions are unstable .",
    "this allows a simple and robust determination of the total cross section for each reaction channel by activation measurements .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : exp ] we describe our experimental procedures for the measurement of @xmath0-induced reaction cross sections on @xmath2zn  and @xmath2zn(@xmath0,@xmath0)@xmath2zn  scattering .",
    "[ sec : an_scat ] presents the analysis of our new scattering data and further scattering data from literature . a comparison between the total reaction cross sections @xmath1  from scattering and from the sum of the individual reaction cross sections will be given in sect .  [",

    "the predictions of recent global @xmath0-nucleus potentials will be compared to our experimental reaction data in sec .",
    "[ sec : pred ] .",
    "a final discussion and conclusions will be provided in sect .",
    "[ sec : summ ] .",
    "in order to give a comprehensive experimental description of the @xmath2zn+@xmath0  system , the cross sections of the following reaction channels were measured in the present work : the elastic @xmath0-scattering cross section at e@xmath11=12.1 and 16.1 mev was measured in a wide angular range .",
    "inelastic scattering leading to the first four exited states of @xmath2zn  was also measured in an angular range limited to a more backward region .",
    "using the activation technique , the cross sections of the @xmath2zn(@xmath0,@xmath3)@xmath12ge , @xmath2zn(@xmath0,n)@xmath13ge , and @xmath2zn(@xmath0,p)@xmath13ga  reactions were also measured at the same energies . since the experimental techniques of both the scattering and activation experiments were already described in detail elsewhere @xcite , here only the most important features of the measurements and the results are presented .",
    "the scattering experiments were carried out at the cyclotron accelerator of atomki which provided @xmath0  beams of 12.05 and 16.12mev energy with typical intensity of 150na .",
    "targets were produced by evaporating highly enriched ( 99.71% ) metallic @xmath2zn  onto thin ( 40@xmath14g/@xmath15 ) carbon foils .",
    "the thickness of the @xmath2zn  layer was about 150@xmath14g/@xmath15 determined by @xmath0  energy loss measurements .",
    "the energy loss at the energies of the scattering experiment is negligible compared to the energy width of the beam .",
    "the angular distributions were measured in a scattering chamber equipped with seven ion implanted si particle detectors .",
    "the detectors were fixed on turntables enabling the measurement of scattered particle spectra in an angular range between 20@xmath16 and 175@xmath16 .",
    "in addition , two detectors were fixed at @xmath1715@xmath16 with respect to the beam .",
    "these monitor detectors were used for normalization purposes .",
    "two typical scattering spectra are shown in fig.[fig : scatteringspectra ] recorded in the forward and backward regions , respectively .",
    "peaks corresponding to elastic and inelastic scattering events on @xmath2zn  and on carbon and oxygen target components are indicated .",
    "two typical scattering spectra measured at 16.12mev @xmath0-energy at forward ( 35@xmath16 , upper panel ) and backward ( 165@xmath16 , lower panel ) angles .",
    "the origin of the most prominent peaks are indicated.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the elastic scattering cross sections were measured at both energies in the complete angular range between 20@xmath16 and 175@xmath16 .",
    "the excitation energies of the first four excited states of @xmath2zn  are 991.6kev ( @xmath18 ) , 1799.4kev ( @xmath18 ) , 1910.3kev ( @xmath19 ) , and 2306.8kev ( @xmath20 ) @xcite .",
    "the energy of the first excited state is far away enough from both the ground state and the higher energy excited states so that the peak corresponding to the inelastic scattering leading to this excited state is well separated in the particle spectra .",
    "therefore , the inelastic scattering cross section for this excited state could be determined over a wider angular range . the only limitation is caused by the elastic scattering events on carbon and oxygen in the target which start to overlap with the inelastic peak in the forward angle region .",
    "therefore , the inelastic scattering cross section to the first excited state could be only determined in the angular range between 40@xmath16 and 175@xmath16 .",
    "the second and third excited states could not be fully resolved because of their energy difference of about 100kev .",
    "therefore , only the sum of the cross sections leading to these states could be measured in the angular range between 60@xmath16 and 175@xmath16 .",
    "owing to the sufficient separation , the inelastic cross section leading to the fourth excited state could be determined from 60@xmath16 to 175@xmath16 .",
    "above the fourth exited state the level density becomes too high , and hence no further inelastic cross sections could be measured to higher lying levels .",
    "the experimental data will be provided to the community in tabular form through the exfor database @xcite .",
    "the activation cross section measurements had been already carried out and published in full details @xcite . in the present work",
    "only one additional data point was determined since in @xcite no measurement was carried out at 16.12mev @xmath0-energy , which is one of the energies where the scattering cross section was measured in the present work and the total cross section @xmath1  is determined .",
    "the new measurement at 16.12mev @xmath0-energy was carried out with exactly the same conditions as the experiments of @xcite .",
    "the cyclotron accelerator provided the @xmath0-beam which bombarded a thin natural isotopic composition zn target on al foil backing .",
    "the number of the @xmath12ge , @xmath13ge , and @xmath13ga  isotopes produced by the @xmath2zn(@xmath0,@xmath3)@xmath12ge , @xmath2zn(@xmath0,n)@xmath13ge , and @xmath2zn(@xmath0,p)@xmath13ga  reactions , respectively , was determined off - line by measuring the @xmath3-radiation following the decay of the reaction products with a shielded 100% relative efficiency hpge detector .",
    "table [ tab : actres ] summarizes the results of the activation cross section measurements . the first row at 12.05mev @xmath0-energy is taken from @xcite while the second one at 16.12mev is the result of the present work .",
    "the last column shows the sum of the cross sections of the three reactions .",
    "these values will be used in the next sections for the determination of the total cross sections .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < \" , ]     the total reaction cross section @xmath1  is mainly composed of the dominating ( @xmath0,p )  and ( @xmath0,n )  channels .",
    "the branching between these two channels is sensitive to the chosen nucleon potential whereas the total reaction cross section @xmath1  is sensitive only to the @xmath0-nucleus potential .",
    "the talys default option for the nucleon potential @xcite works very well here and was not changed in this work .",
    "excellent agreement for the ( @xmath0,n )  and ( @xmath0,p )  cross sections is found , see fig .",

    "the cross section of the @xmath2zn(@xmath0,@xmath3)@xmath12ge  reaction is sensitive to the @xmath0-nucleus potential and to the @xmath3-ray strength function . here",
    "the best result is obtained using the hartree - fock bcs @xmath3-ray strength from @xcite .",
    "the talys default option using generalized lorentzian @xmath3-ray strength from @xcite significantly underestimates the @xmath2zn(@xmath0,@xmath3)@xmath12ge  cross section ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : reac ] , thin red long - dashed line ) .",
    "elastic and inelastic @xmath2zn(@xmath0,@xmath0)@xmath2zn  scattering was measured at the energies of 12.1mev and 16.1mev . at the same energies",
    "the cross sections of the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 ) , ( @xmath0,n ) , and ( @xmath0,p )  reactions were determined using the activation technique .",
    "the experimental angular distributions of elastic scattering cover the full angular range and thus allow for a precise determination of the total non - elastic reaction cross section @xmath1  with uncertainties of about @xmath21% . a perfect description of the elastic angular distributions",
    "could only be achieved using phase shift fits .",
    "the surprising rise of the elastic cross sections at very backward angles may be considered as so - called alas and could not be fully explained .",
    "fortunately , the behavior of the angular distibutions at these very backward angles practically does not affect the determination of the total cross sections @xmath1 .",
    "the total reaction cross sections follow a general smooth trend when presented as so - called reduced cross sections @xmath22  versus reduced energies @xmath23 .",
    "the data for @xmath2zn  lie in between the common behavior for heavy target nuclei with @xmath24 @xcite and slightly increased values for lighter target nuclei with @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the total non - elastic reaction cross section was also determined from the sum over the cross sections of all non - elastic channels ( including inelastic scattering ) . at the lower energy of 12.1mev excellent agreement between @xmath1  from elastic scattering and from the sum over non - elastic channels",
    "was found ; here almost all open channels ( including inelastic scattering to low - lying states in @xmath2zn ) could be determined experimentally . at the higher energy of 16.1mev we find again",
    "excellent agreement for @xmath1  from the two approaches .",
    "however , now a significant contribution of inelastic scattering to higher - lying states in @xmath2zn  is required which is indeed predicted in the statistical model . in turn , this may be considered as an experimental verification of these statistical model predictions . compared to our previous work @xcite ,",
    "the experimental uncertainties in the comparison of @xmath1  from the two approaches could be reduced significantly by about a factor of two .    usually , the cross sections of @xmath0-induced reactions in the statistical model depend sensitively on the chosen @xmath0-nucleus potential . at 12.1mev and 16.1mev ,",
    "the recent global @xmath0-nucleus potentials predict very similar total reaction cross sections @xmath1 , and with the exception of the latest potential by su and han @xcite this behavior surprisingly persists down to lower energies .",
    "thus , in the case of @xmath2zn  the total reaction cross section @xmath1  can be described well , and the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 ) , ( @xmath0,n ) , and ( @xmath0,p )  data can be used to constrain further ingredients of the statistical model . in particular",
    ", it is found that the talys default nucleon optical potential @xcite works very well , whereas the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  data can be best described using the hartree - fock bcs @xmath3-ray strength @xcite but the default generalized lorentzian @xcite significantly underestimates the experimental data .",

    "<S> background : :    @xmath0-nucleus potentials play an essential role for the    calculation of @xmath0-induced reaction cross sections at    low energies in the statistical model . </S>",
    "<S> uncertainties of these    calculations are related to ambiguities in the adjustment of the    potential parameters to experimental elastic scattering angular    distributions and to the energy dependence of the effective    @xmath0-nucleus potentials . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    the present work studies the total reaction cross section    @xmath1 of @xmath0-induced    reactions at low energies which can be determined from the elastic    scattering angular distribution or from the sum over the cross    sections of all open non - elastic channels . </S>",
    "<S> method : :    elastic and inelastic    @xmath2zn(@xmath0,@xmath0)@xmath2zn    angular distributions were measured at two energies around the coulomb    barrier at 12.1mev and 16.1mev . </S>",
    "<S> reaction cross sections of the    ( @xmath0,@xmath3 ) ,    ( @xmath0,@xmath4 ) , and    ( @xmath0,@xmath5 ) reactions were measured at the    same energies using the activation technique . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of    missing non - elastic channels were estimated from statistical model    calculations . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    the total reaction cross sections from elastic scattering and from the    sum of the cross sections over all open non - elastic channels agree    well within the uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> this finding confirms the consistency    of the experimental data . at the higher energy of 16.1mev , </S>",
    "<S> the    predicted significant contribution of compound - inelastic scattering to    the total reaction cross section is confirmed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> as a    by - product it is found that most recent global    @xmath0-nucleus potentials are able to describe the    reaction cross sections for @xmath2zn around the coulomb    barrier . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    total reaction cross sections of @xmath0-induced    reactions can be well determined from elastic scattering angular    distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the present study proves experimentally that the total    cross section from elastic scattering is identical to the sum of    non - elastic reaction cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the statistical model can    reliably be used to distribute the total reaction cross section among    the different open channels . </S>"
