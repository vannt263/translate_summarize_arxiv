    "there are many relativistic frameworks in which hadronic systems can be described .",
    "each of them has its advantages and its drawbacks .",
    "field theory is the most ambitious one but it implies an undetermined , possibly , infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "lattice calculations can account in principle for the complexity of the qcd interaction but they are limited by their necessary finite size .",
    "finally , relativistic quantum mechanics ( rqm ) offers the advantage to rely on a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "it is therefore very close to the simplest view of the surrounding world , with hadrons considered as a bound state of quarks but these ones can only be effective objects .    in this paper",
    ", we will be concerned with the application of the last framework to the calculation of form factors of pseudoscalar mesons ( pion and kaon ) .",
    "many approaches were proposed , depending on the symmetry properties of the surface on which physics is described @xcite .",
    "this entails that some of the generators of the poincar algebra have a dynamical character while the other ones have a kinematic one .",
    "the construction of the algebra was first done by bakamjian and thomas @xcite and extended later on to the front and point forms @xcite .",
    "it relies on the introduction of a mass operator that is poincar invariant and can be used in any form .",
    "the different forms were employed for the calculation of form factors of various hadrons , mesons as well as baryons . in principle",
    ", results should not depend on the chosen form @xcite but one of them may be more efficient than another one .",
    "looking at the results of calculations , generally based on a single - particle current , it was found that they could strongly depend on the form for the same solution of the mass operator @xcite or suppose quite different solutions of this operator if they were fitted to some measurements @xcite .",
    "this is especially true for the pion charge form factor .",
    "in such a case , one learns nothing about the underlying dynamics of the system under consideration .",
    "the dependence on the form points to the role of interaction terms that are here or there depending on the choice of the underlying hypersurface .",
    "recently , it was found that constraints stemming from the poincar covariance of currents under space - time translations @xcite could play an important role in discriminating between different approaches for the calculation of form factors @xcite .",
    "these constraints , go beyond the usual energy - momentum conservation which is assumed in all calculations and involve a relation between the squared momentum transferred to the system and the one transferred to the constituents .",
    "they imply that the current should necessarily contain many - particle terms .",
    "the only exception is the case of the front form with @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , an indirect way for accounting for these many - particle currents was found with the important result that all forms can now produce identical predictions for form factors from the same solution of a mass operator .",
    "however , these results were concerning a pion - like scalar system composed of scalar particles , which is not of much interest for physical systems made of quarks that have spin 1/2 .",
    "it is noticed that form factors corresponding to the simplest triangle feynman diagram @xcite could be reproduced exactly @xcite .",
    "those for the wick - cutkosky model @xcite could also be reproduced to a very good accuracy , @xcite , pointing in this case to a rather good determination of the mass operator @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the mass operator has a quadratic form .    in the present work ,",
    "we want to extend the above work for scalar constituents to the case of pseudoscalar mesons that are considered as quark - antiquark systems with the goal of getting , ultimately , some information on the underlying mass operator .",
    "many works have been done for the pion and kaon mesons . though the distinction is not always clear as soon as approximations are made",
    ", they roughly fall in two groups based on field theory @xcite and on relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite . a somewhat different group contains lattice calculations @xcite . within the rqm approach , which we are interested in here ,",
    "most works have relied on the front - form approach with @xmath0 but there are also a few works relying on the instant- or point - form approaches as well as a front - form one with @xmath1",
    ". most often , simple wave functions , with a gaussian or a power - law expression , were used . for a given wave function ,",
    "calculated form factors were found to be strongly dependent on the form that was used @xcite and , _ vice versa _",
    ", when a fit to measurements was done , quite different wave functions were obtained @xcite .",
    "there are only few works using a more founded wave function , obtained from a mass operator containing both confinement and an instantaneous one - gluon exchange interactions . in absence of quark form factors ,",
    "the first ones @xcite , based on the front form with @xmath0 , tend to overestimate the measurements , forcing the authors to introduce some quark form factor and , thus , providing some information about this quantity .",
    "the other one @xcite was motivated by reproducing the asymptotic pion charge form factor in both the front form with @xmath0 and the breit - frame instant form .",
    "the parameters were not especially optimized on some data but this work tends also to overestimate data though not as much as the first works .",
    "had an other form been used ( point form , or front form with a parallel momentum configuration , or instant form with a large average momentum and also a parallel momentum configuration ) , the corresponding form factors would underestimate the measurements instead .",
    "thus , between the determination of the best form , the role of the wave function ( or the mass operator ) , the contribution of two - particle currents ensuring the right asymptotic behavior , the role of possible quark form factors , we believe that there is a sufficiently large number of reasons to look at the charge form factor of pseudoscalar mesons in rqm frameworks and possible information about the mass operator . independently , for a somewhat academic system made of scalar constituents , it was found that accounting for the constraints from covariant space - time translations was allowing one to recover expressions of form factors obtained in a dispersion - relation approach @xcite .",
    "the question arises of whether such a result holds for systems consisting of quarks .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the second section ,",
    "we discuss a number of ingredients relative to the determination of the mass operator , which we would like to check ultimately from the comparison of form factors calculated using its solutions to those actually measured .",
    "they concern in particular the linear or quadratic form of the mass operator , the normalization of the solutions and the consequences for form factors in the asymptotic domain .",
    "the third section is devoted to constraints stemming from the poincar covariance of currents under space - time translations while their implementation for form factors of pseudoscalar mesons is discussed in the fourth section .",
    "the role of these constraints is illustrated in the fifth section by using a gaussian wave function that is approximately a solution of an interaction containing only confinement .",
    "some observations are made in relation with solving some paradoxes and restoring fundamental symmetries . in the sixth section",
    ", we account for one - gluon exchange contributions to both the mass operator and the current .",
    "we provide values for ingredients ( string tension , quark mass and qcd coupling ) that allow one to approximately reproduce measurements in the pion case while paying attention to the charge radius and the pion decay constant .",
    "the seventh section contains a discussion of the results and the conclusion .",
    "the construction of the poincar algebra in rqm approaches supposes that the mass operator fulfills some conditions such as independence of the total momentum , of the underlying hyperplane orientation , or of the angular momentum but , apart from these general properties , not much is known about it . in a two - body system , it depends on a 3-dimensional internal variable , denoted @xmath2 here .",
    "the mass operator therefore looks very much like a non - relativistic interaction to which it can be identified in some cases .",
    "we nevertheless stress that the rqm approach is not a center of mass non - relativistic one with some relativistic corrections .",
    "it is characterized by a deep internal consistency , often ignored , which stems from the bakamjian - thomas transformation in the instant form @xcite and its generalizations in the other cases @xcite .",
    "the bakamjian - thomas construction @xcite was originally involving a linear mass operator , @xmath3 , but a quadratic one , @xmath4 , could be used as well @xcite .",
    "this choice supposes that the corresponding interaction , @xmath5 , be related to the linear - case one , @xmath6 , by the relation @xmath7 .",
    "a reason to prefer the quadratic expression is that @xmath8 can be identified to @xmath9 , which is more likely the quantity to be considered rather than the quantity @xmath10 , but a stronger reason is provided by the examination of results for the simplest triangle feynman diagram with scalar constituents @xcite .",
    "this one represents a theoretical model that is free of dynamical uncertainty and , moreover , can be easily studied .",
    "it provides a minimal set of results that any rqm implementation of relativity should reproduce .",
    "looking at the expression of the charge , which can also be considered as a definition of the normalization in the present case , it is found that , in the case of unequal - mass constituents , it can be written as : @xmath11 where the wave function @xmath12 is given by : @xmath13 with @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the occurrence of the normalization front factor , @xmath16 , may look strange here but it provides some simplification of the normalization condition when the integral is performed over the mandelstam variable @xmath17 rather than the internal momentum variable @xmath18 ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] ) .",
    "while the wave function , @xmath19 , is more appropriate for expressing form factors , due to factorizing out typical relativistic quantities @xmath20 , a related expression could be more useful to make the relation with the solution of a hermitian mass operator .",
    "the relation is given by : @xmath21 which corresponds to the normalization condition : @xmath22 the expression of the wave function @xmath23 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : wfk2 ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : wfk3 ] ) obviously suggests that it can be the solution of an equation with a quadratic mass operator having the form : @xmath24 which , due to its separable form , can be easily solved . to make sense , the coupling @xmath25 at the r.h.s .",
    "should tend to 0 so that its product with the diverging integral @xmath26 be finite .",
    "this does not prevent one , however , to use the wave function , without any problem , for the calculation of form factors for the model under consideration .",
    "it is interesting to contrast the above result with what would be obtained from a semi - relativistic schrdinger equation in the center of mass : @xmath27 the equation has also a separable form and , up to a numerical factor , its solution is given by : @xmath28 comparing this solution with the one for the quadratic mass operator , it is seen that they behave differently at large @xmath18 .",
    "this feature has consequences for the convergence of the norm but , more importantly , for estimating the charge form factor at large momentum transfers , as far as the charge form factor extrapolates the expression of the norm at @xmath29 . in the present case",
    ", the charge form factor so obtained would tend to overshoot the theoretical one , evidencing a wrong asymptotic power - law behavior .",
    "the reasons of the above discrepancy have been analyzed in detail , what is made possible by the simplicity of the theoretical model @xcite . actually , considering the center of mass time component of the charge current",
    ", one should add to the contribution due to positive - energy constituents : @xmath30 the one due to negative - energy constituents ( double z - type diagram ) : @xmath31 considering the sum : @xmath32 it is seen that it factorizes into a term that is identical to the norm one obtained in relation with the quadratic mass operator , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : norm ] , [ eq : wfk2 ] ) , and a factor @xmath33 , which is nothing but the value of the quantity appearing in the time component of the charge current , @xmath34 , calculated in the center of mass .",
    "thus , instead of a quadratic mass operator , one could as well use a linear one but this last choice would require adding further terms in the current so that to make results consistent with the predictions of the simplest triangle feynman diagram . we do not think this is the most efficient way to proceed and we therefore discard this choice .",
    "the choice of a quadratic mass operator has further advantages .",
    "the invariance of the charge under boosts is more naturally satisfied with the corresponding solution , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wfk2 ] ) . in the instant form , for instance ,",
    "the expression of the charge for a system with momentum @xmath35 may read : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 . in this case",
    ", one can easily verify that the quantities @xmath40 and @xmath41 are lorentz invariant , which is not so for the quantities generalizing to an arbitrary total momentum those given separately by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f1p ] ) and ( [ eq : f1 m ] ) .",
    "one could add that the suppression of the center of mass time component of the charge current with respect to the scalar one by a factor of the order @xmath42 is more easily accounted for within a framework based on the quadratic mass operator .",
    "actually , some of the above properties can be ascribed to a fully relativistic calculation which involves both forward and backward time - ordered processes , as given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f1p ] ) and ( [ eq : f1 m ] ) for instance , often offering convergence properties better than the one with retaining the first of these processes .    after making the choice of using a quadratic mass operator , the following question concerns the interaction itself . in the non - relativistic case ,",
    "an instantaneous approximation is most often used ( partly motivated by the success of the coulomb interaction ) .",
    "again , the consideration of a simple model , the wick - cutkosky one @xcite , is instructive . to reproduce the ground - state energy using the instantaneous approximation",
    ", it was found that the coupling constant should be renormalized significantly .",
    "this renormalization takes into account contributions that , in a time - ordered diagram approach , would correspond to retardation effects in a first approximation .",
    "the charge and scalar form factors calculated in this way were found to roughly agree with those calculated from the original wick - cutkosky model , including the large @xmath43 domain @xcite .",
    "a better agreement , at the level of a few % , was obtained by improving the interaction .",
    "the corrections , of the order of @xmath44 , were chosen so that the power - law behavior of the interaction in the high - momentum limit be not changed .",
    "interestingly , the interaction in this high - momentum limit becomes closer to the bare one .",
    "the above results are important because they indicate how the interaction entering the mass operator should be chosen so that to reproduce results expected for form factors in the asymptotic domain .    the earlier results that we reminded for the scalar - constituent case may be useful for the pseudoscalar mesons we are considering here .",
    "there is however a significant gap between the two systems .",
    "the mesons involve spin-1/2 constituents instead of scalar ones and the exchanged boson has spin 1 instead of 0 .",
    "while , for the wick - cutkosky model , we had to only consider the ladder diagram , for a realistic description of mesons , we have to consider both the ladder and crossed diagrams .",
    "moreover , gluons that are exchanged between quarks carry some color .",
    "this prevents that the contributions due to crossed diagrams and to retardation effects cancel , as they do in the coulomb case .",
    "one can not therefore rely on the successful instantaneous character of the coulomb interaction to justify _ a priori _ the use of a similar approximation for the gluon - exchange case . as a further source of uncertainty",
    ", we should add the confinement interaction and its interference with the gluon - exchange one .",
    "thus , while the determination of the mass operator in the scalar - particle case seems to be on a good track , the determination in the qcd case is largely _",
    "terra incognita_. the first one can be at most a guide for the second one . as a starting point",
    ", one could consider that the solution of the mass operator , @xmath45 , is described by a gaussian wave function for the confining part and by a term behaving asymptotically like @xmath46 ( in our conventions @xcite ) for the perturbative part produced by a one - gluon exchange .",
    "we expect that the comparison of theoretical predictions and measurements will be very instructive to reduce the uncertainty on the determination of the pseudoscalar - meson mass operator .",
    "this supposes that predictions do not depend on the chosen implementation of relativity however , what we consider in next section .",
    "it is well known that predictions of form factors in the single - particle current approximation , when fitted to measurements , lead to solutions of the mass operator that are strongly dependent on the form that has been used @xcite . as a complementary information , and always in the same approximation of a single - particle current , predictions made from the same solution of a mass operator exhibit a strong dependence on the form employed to implement relativity @xcite .",
    "this situation is quite unsatisfactory as a correct implementation of relativity should ensure that properties of the system under consideration should behave covariantly under transformations of the poincar group .",
    "these transformation properties are somewhat kinematic ones and should not depend on the underlying dynamics .",
    "as the dependence on a form implies a dependence on the underlying hypersurface on which physics is described and that changing one hypersurface for another one implies interaction effects , it can be inferred that the above calculations of form factors miss some interaction effects . in this respect ,",
    "we notice that accounting for constraints related to the covariant transformations of currents under space - time translations could remove discrepancies for the scalar system composed of scalar constituents .",
    "the above constraints go beyond the usual overall energy - momentum conservation that is , evidently , assumed in all calculations .",
    "there is no special difficulty in generalizing to spin-1/2 constituents considered in this work results previously obtained for spin-0 ones .",
    "we therefore summarize below the main points , providing for some of them a presentation that complements the one given elsewhere @xcite .    under poincar space - time translations ,",
    "a vector or a scalar current ( denoted @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively ) transforms as : @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents the 4-momentum operator . making the choice @xmath51 ,",
    "one also obtains the relations : @xmath52 considering the matrix element of the above relations between eigenstates of @xmath50 , one obtains the following relation : @xmath53 which allows one to factorize the @xmath54 dependence .",
    "combined with the function @xmath55 describing the interaction with an external probe carrying momentum @xmath56 , and integrating over the @xmath54 variable or assuming space - time translation invariance , one gets the usual energy - momentum conservation relation : @xmath57        this relation tells nothing about the relation of the momentum transferred to the system , @xmath56 , and to the constituents , @xmath58 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for kinematic definitions ) .",
    "it tells nothing either on the single - particle character of the current , most often assumed , or its many - particle one .",
    "this is the place where further relations involving implicitly the covariant transformation properties of the current under translations given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : translat1 ] ) can be useful .",
    "these ones , mentioned by lev @xcite , involve the commutator of the current with the momentum operator @xmath50 on the one hand , the derivatives of the current with respect to @xmath54 on the other hand .",

    "we observe that the relation could be satisfied in a field - theory approach , where @xmath64 , but , until recently , it was not checked within rqm approaches where it turns out to be generally violated . in this case",
    ", the violation shows that the assumption of a single - particle current is not supported by the above constraints .",
    "the current should then involve many - particle terms and it can be hoped that these ones contribute to restore the equivalence of different forms for the calculation of form factors @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it is found that eq .",

    "when it is considered , the tail of the wave function shows a slow decrease given by the power - law behavior @xmath46 ( @xmath187 for the quantity shown in the figure ) .",
    "this tail is responsible for a slower decrease of form factors in comparison to the pure gaussian case .    due to a limited experimental information",
    ", we did not consider the kaon charge form factor .",
    "let s first mention that a lower value of the string tension , as suggested by the pion results , would provide a better account of measurements in comparison to what was shown in sect .",
    "the main question is whether the one - gluon exchange contribution to the current would cancel most of the effect as it does for the pion . in absence of a detailed study of this contribution for the kaon , it is difficult to answer .",
    "we only note that a calculation with an average quark mass , @xmath188 leads to an effect slightly less than a half of the pion one .",
    "we provided in the text of the present paper a discussion of ingredients allowing us to make a comparison with other rqm calculations , especially with respect to the choice of the mass operator , possible quark form factors and non - perturbative effects ( introduction and sect .",
    "[ mass_op ] ) , and two - particle currents motivated by the asymptotic behavior of the pion charge form factor ( this section ) .",
    "one could also compare present results with those of field - theory or lattice calculations .",
    "in making such a comparison , one should however take into account that calculations to some order in a given framework are not necessarily identical to the ones in other frameworks .",
    "considering first the contribution that allows one to reproduce the asymptotic behavior of the pion charge form factor , the present one is found to be in good agreement with the field - theory one calculated over a large @xmath43 range in ref .",
    "@xcite for instance and with the one calculated differently at high @xmath43 in ref .",
    "@xcite ( the comparison is not possible at small and moderate @xmath43 in this case ) .",
    "it qualitatively agrees with the one obtained in lattice calculations by comparing unquenched and quenched calculations @xcite . in either case , this contribution is not essential to explain the bulk contribution at small and moderate @xmath43 ( below @xmath189 gev@xmath145 ) . in this range , it looks as if our results agree with the field - theory or lattice ones but we should stress that our results are calculated up to the first order in the qcd coupling , @xmath190 , while the other ones are likely to include many orders .",
    "we mentioned possible problems with accounting for the one - gluon exchange non - perturbatively in a rqm calculation together with the standard value @xmath190 .",
    "the comparison of rqm calculations with field - theory or lattice ones probably suggests that the former ones should use an effective coupling with a value smaller than the standard one .",
    "this could account for retardation effects or , perhaps also , the running character of the qcd coupling .",
    "a further suggestion would consist in introducing quark form factors .",
    "in this paper we considered the consequences of covariant poincar space - time translations for the description of the form factor of pseudoscalar mesons in a rqm framework .",
    "this property is generally used to factorize out the dependence on the space - time position in the current matrix element , allowing one to obtain the energy - momentum conservation . for the calculation of form factors",
    ", one can thus use the current at @xmath191 , which , most often , is taken as a single - particle current , independently of the form of relativity that is employed .",
    "we showed that the energy - momentum conservation does not exhaust all properties stemming from the covariant character of poincar space - time translations .",
    "looking at relations derived in the vicinity of the point @xmath191 @xcite , and implying the squared momentum transferred to the constituents and to the one transferred to the system , we found that they are generally inconsistent with the single - particle assumption for the current . only the standard front - form approach with the condition @xmath0 could fulfill the expected relations . for other forms or other kinematic conditions , we worked out a way to account for the further relations",
    ". it amounts to introduce interaction effects in the relation of the constituents momenta to the momentum transfer while keeping the single - particle structure of the current .",
    "these effects , that are here or there depending on the approach , correspond to take into account many - particle currents at all orders in the interaction as an expansion would show . in field - theory",
    "based approaches , they would correspond to z - type diagram ones .",
    "when these effects are introduced , the equivalence of different approaches can be restored provided that the matrix element of the single - particle current in each form is appropriately chosen .",
    "interestingly , present theoretical results for the pseudoscalar - meson charge form factor reproduce those expected in a dispersion - relation approach @xcite ( with some correction for the last reference ) .",
    "except for the standard front - form case ( with @xmath0 ) , such a result could not be anticipated .",
    "wondering about this result , we feel that two ingredients play an essential role . to a large extent ,",
    "the effects of constraints considered here tend to restore the equality of the squared momenta transferred to the constituents and the one transferred to the system .",
    "this relation is always fulfilled in a field - theory approach and , _ a fortiori _ , in a dispersion - relation approach which is based on this framework , but it is generally not satisfied in the simplest rqm approach .",
    "the second ingredient concerns the matrix element of the single - particle current to start with . in absence of interaction between constituents , the scattering amplitude of the system with the electromagnetic field which underlies implicitly present rqm results ,",
    "is the same as in the dispersion - relation approach . besides this contribution",
    ", the matrix element may also contain extra contributions .",
    "these ones have an interaction character and ensure that its value at @xmath85 , which is associated to the charge and is not concerned by the above constraints , be lorentz invariant .",
    "the effective matrix elements so obtained could differ from the ones naively expected .",
    "it thus appears that getting reliable form factors , which should be independent of the form chosen to implement relativity , implies all aspects of the poincar group : boosts , rotations but also space - time translations .",
    "the above effects have been illustrated in the case of the pion and kaon mesons , using a description of these mesons accounting essentially for the confinement interaction .",
    "the effects can be especially large for some calculations in the pion case , in relation with the fact that the pion mass is significantly smaller than the sum of the relativistic kinetic energies of the constituents in comparison with the kaon case . noting that in absence of these effects , these calculations would produce a charge radius that would go to infinity while the mass of the system vanishes as well as other paradoxes @xcite , it is probably not overstated to say that the above effects remove violations of space - time translations covariance properties that these calculations imply .",
    "to a very large extent , present results agree qualitatively with those obtained for scalar constituents @xcite but they offer the advantage to concern a physical system . in comparison with experiment , this first set of results provides a good account of measurements with a string tension equal to 0.2 gev@xmath145 .",
    "it represents a reasonable starting point for improvements .",
    "necessary improvements involve the contributions of the one - gluon exchange in both the interaction and in the current .",
    "the first one has been estimated from a perturbative - type calculation , taking into account that a complete non - perturbative calculation could lead to some difficulties with the qcd coupling @xmath190 .",
    "the second one ensures that the expected qcd asymptotic behavior for the charge form factor is recovered .",
    "it is found in the pion case that the two contributions tend to increase the form factor , especially at high @xmath43 . a quite reasonable account of measurements",
    "is obtained by lowering the string tension from 0.2 gev@xmath145 to 0.14 gev@xmath145 , a value that is probably at the lower limit of what is acceptable .",
    "interestingly , however , the change in the string tension has provided a better description of measurements in both the low-@xmath43 and the intermediate-@xmath43 domains .",
    "we could probably improve the description by playing with the different ingredients , by requiring for instance that the mass operator reproduces the mass difference between pseudoscalar and vector mesons or between the non - strange and strange mesons .",
    "we nevertheless refrain to do it as we believe that many questions could be raised at this point concerning the theoretical inputs .    from this study",
    ", we can take for granted a number of features .",
    "the contributions of one - gluon exchange in both the interaction and in the current become important ingredients of a realistic description of the pion charge form factor around and beyond @xmath192gev@xmath145 , due to their increasing role with @xmath43 .",
    "the role of the contribution in the current could extend to the low-@xmath43 domain where it compares to other effects .",
    "remarkably , this contribution was found to be rather stable and not depending much on which calculation we were performing . in comparing different results , we found it was important that they correspond to the same value of the pion decay constant , what was achieved by fitting the quark mass .",
    "this prevented us to make biased conclusions in many circumstances .",
    "while the above contributions seem to go in the right direction , questions however may arise from the limitation of their study .",
    "as remembered in the introduction , an unrestricted calculation of the one - gluon exchange contribution to the interaction would produce a too large form factor .",
    "this could be remedied by using a smaller value for the string tension but this one is already at the lower limit of what is acceptable .",
    "we should add that describing the confining force as a sum of a kinetic energy and a linear @xmath193-dependent term could have similar effects to some extent and would not _ a priori _ alleviate the problem .",
    "this , in turn , raises the question of the precise form of the confinement interaction and its interplay with the one - gluon exchange contribution to the interaction .",
    "let s mention that retardation effects , which have been considered in the scalar constituent case , could decrease this last contribution but it is not clear whether they would be sufficient to remove the above problem .",
    "they could also affect the calculation of the meson mass spectrum but there is no indication that this one will be necessarily improved .",
    "as for the one - gluon exchange contribution to the current , the question that may be raised concerns higher - order corrections in the qcd coupling @xmath164 , which have been discarded for simplicity in the expression we used .",
    "the question also concerns possible corrections related to the confinement interaction , which have no reason to be negligible in comparison to the contribution retained here but are completely unknown .",
    "ultimately , one could invoke quark form factors @xcite though these ones are not quite consistent at first sight with the expression of the asymptotic behavior of the pion charge form factor .",
    "an improved model would consist in considering the coupling to the photon of quark - antiquark pairs generated by one - gluon exchange .",
    "it can incorporate the vector - meson phenomenology @xcite and in particular the @xmath194-vector meson dominance one @xcite that could be important for the range @xmath195 1 gev@xmath145 .",
    "part of this last effect is accounted for in the present work @xcite but there is another part corresponding to quark - antiquark correlations which is certainly not .",
    "how much space is left for such an effect in the present work is not clear but some could allow one to correct or to alleviate part of the drawbacks mentioned above .",
    "we started this work with the idea that an implementation of relativity free of uncertainties relative to the choice of a particular form should be used for studying the form factor of pseudoscalar mesons and , thus , for getting information on the mass operator describing these particles .",
    "from a phenomenological viewpoint , it sounds that this task should not be too difficult , partly due to the fact that the simplest description is already doing well .",
    "the main question is whether this information is consistent with what is theoretically expected .",
    "this part of the task could be more difficult .",
    "it would probably require more elaborate descriptions of both the mass operator and the current within the rqm framework but , also , more accurate measurements of the pion charge form factor for @xmath196 gev@xmath145 to discriminate between different schemes . clarifying the role of the measurement at around @xmath197 gev@xmath145 by making it more accurate",
    "would be specially useful .",
    "it seems difficult to accommodate its present central value within descriptions of the form factor which do relatively well at smaller momentum transfers .",
    "a complementary study would involve the consideration of the pseudoscalar meson spectrum .",
    "though it is likely very approximate , the mass operator obtained here could be used for predictions of this spectrum . in turn , the comparison with experiment could lead to improve the mass operator and help to discriminate effects that are due to its description from the ones that are due to the description of the electromagnetic interaction .    *",
