    "radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) that are characterised by extreme variability in their radio cores , high and variable polarization , superluminal jet speeds and compact radio emission , are collectively referred to as ` blazars ' @xcite .",
    "blazars comprise flat - spectrum radio - loud quasars and bl  lac objects .",
    "their extreme characteristics have commonly been understood to be a consequence of relativistic beaming effects due to a fast jet aligned close to our line of sight @xcite .",
    "the radio - loud unified scheme postulates that quasars and bl  lacs are the beamed end - on counterparts of the fanaroff - riley ( fr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) type ii and type i radio galaxies , respectively @xcite .",
    "the relatively lower radio luminosity fri radio galaxies are referred to as `` edge - darkened '' since their brightest lobe emission lies closer to the radio cores and fades further out , while the higher radio luminosity frii radio galaxies are `` edge - brightened '' because of the presence of bright and compact hot spots where the kpc - scale jets terminate .",
    "this definition turns out to be useful for fri - frii classification when hot spots are not clearly delineated ( @xmath6  3.2 ) .",
    "the fanaroff - riley dichotomy has been proposed to arise due to differences in one or more of the following properties : host galaxy environment @xcite and jet - medium interaction @xcite , jet composition @xcite , black hole mass @xcite , black hole spin @xcite , accretion rate and/or mode @xcite .",
    "many recent findings are , however , posing challenges for the standard unified scheme .",
    "these include the discovery of fri quasars @xcite , frii bl  lacs @xcite , and `` hybrid '' radio morphology sources with an fri jet on one side of the core and an frii jet on the other @xcite .",
    "one of the primary cited differences between quasars and bl  lacs has been the presence of strong , broad emission lines in the quasar spectra and their apparent absence in bl  lacs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have defined the distinction between bl  lacs and quasars at an emission line equivalent width of 5@xmath7 .",
    "however , this distinction has been questioned ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the compact flux density selection criteria of the mojave sample biases it heavily toward highly beamed blazars with high lorentz factors and small viewing angles . while relativistic boosting effects are likely to dominate the source characteristics , the extensive multi - epoch and multi - wavelength data available for the mojave sample on both parsec- and kiloparsec - scales , provides us with unique constraints to test the unified scheme . throughout the paper , we adopt the cosmology in which @xmath12=71 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14=0.27 and @xmath15=0.73 .",

    "these results are consistent with a number of previous radio studies . using a large sample of radio core - dominated agns",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the quasars often show two - sided radio structures with hot spots on one or both sides of the core . however , one - sided morphologies with no discernable compact or diffuse emission on the other side of the core , are also common .    while determining if the blazars had an frii type radio morphology , we relied initially on the presence of one or more compact hot spots at the leading edge of the radio lobes .",
    "when no clear hot spots were visible on either side of the cores , we resorted to the traditional `` edge - brightened '' definition for frii sources , @xmath45 when the brightest radio emission was furthest from the core , we classified the source as an frii .",
    "the remaining sources with no clear hot spots , and the brightest extended emission closest to the cores , were classified as fri types .",
    "even then , it was sometimes difficult to consign the sources to fri or frii classes , and we have listed more than one morphology for some sources in table  [ tabsample ] .",
    "many of the mojave sources show distinctly curved kiloparsec - scale jets .",
    "straight jets are a rarity in the sample .",
    "many mojave quasars exhibit large parsec - to - kiloparsec jet misalignments . while any intrinsic curvature in the jets is likely to be highly exaggerated by projection effects in these low - viewing angle blazars , many sources seem intrinsically distorted .",
    "we discuss in  4.1 how the mojave selection criteria might be preferentially picking up bent jets .",

    "these have been previously tabulated by @xcite , and most recently by @xcite . for our analysis",
    "below , we use a @xmath48 value that represents the fastest moving feature in that source .    the parsec - scale apparent jet speeds and kiloparsec - scale radio core luminosity ( fig .  [ fig : beta ] )",
    "are related by standard beaming relations .",
    "the aspect curve in figure  [ fig : beta ] assumes : @xmath49 , @xmath50  sin  @xmath51  cos  @xmath52 , where the doppler factor , @xmath53  cos  @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the best - fit values for the curve are @xmath56 , @xmath46 and @xmath57 .",
    "the relation between parsec - scale apparent jet speeds and parsec - scale core luminosity for the mojave sample is discussed in greater detail by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we find that the parsec - scale apparent jet speeds are correlated significantly with the extended radio luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] , table  [ tabcorrel ] ) .",
    "partial regression analysis shows that the linear correlation between log@xmath31 and @xmath48 with the effects of luminosity distance removed , is still highly significant ( @xmath33 = 0.273 , @xmath34 statistic = 3.05 , two - tailed probability , @xmath35 = 0.0028 ) .",
    "this implies that more radio powerful sources have faster radio jets . since extended radio luminosity is correlated with the core luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : z ] , table  [ tabcorrel ] ) , and the core luminosity is related to the apparent jet speed , we tested the correlation with a partial correlation test between extended radio luminosity and apparent jet speeds , after removing the effects of radio core luminosity .",
    "this too yielded a statistically significant correlation between extended radio luminosity and parsec - scale apparent jet speeds ( @xmath33 = 0.246 , @xmath34 statistic = 2.72 , @xmath35 = 0.0075 ) .",
    "the significant implication of this result is that faster jets are launched in agns with larger kiloparsec - scale lobe luminosities .",
    "it would therefore appear that the fate of the agn is decided at its conception .",
    "this result undermines the role of the kiloparsec environment on the radio power of a given source .",
    "it also indicates that the 1.4  ghz extended emission is indeed related to jet kinetic power , contrary to some suggestions in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given that there is a large overlap in radio powers between quasars and bl  lac objects , it can be concluded that most quasars have faster jets than most bl  lac objects .",
    "the second noteworthy inference that can be drawn from figure  [ fig : beta ] is that there is a continuous distribution of parsec - scale jet speeds going from bl  lacs to quasars .",
    "this supports the idea that the distinction between the bl  lac and quasar population , at an equivalent width of 5@xmath7 , is essentially an arbitrary one at least in terms of radio jet properties ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , we note that inspite of the two blazar classes displaying a smooth continuation in properties ( as is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] and other plots ) , they sometimes reveal differences in the correlation test results when considered separately . in table",
    "[ tabcorrel ] we have listed the correlation test results separately for quasars and bl lacs , if they differed from results for the combined blazar population .",
    "bl  lacs considered alone sometimes failed to exhibit the correlations observed in quasars ( also see  3.1 ) .",
    "apart from the possible effects of small number statistics , a simple interpretation of this finding could be that unlike the quasars , the bl  lacs do not constitute a homogeneous population . as has been previously suggested in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the bl lacs might constitute the beamed population of both fri and frii radio galaxies .",
    "we note that @xcite have demonstrated that hbls ( which are absent in mojave ) conform to the standard unification scheme with respect to fri radio galaxies .",
    "this again supports the proposed inhomogenity within the bl lac class .",
    "preliminary monte carlo simulations of a population of agn similar to that of mojave also show a correlation between apparent jet speed and extended luminosity ( cooper et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the simulations are based on the luminosity function of @xcite , and assume that the extended luminosity is unbeamed and proportional to the intrinsic unbeamed parsec - scale luminosity .",
    "we are currently incorporating the luminosity function derived from the mojave sample by @xcite into the simulations .",
    "apparent misalignment in the jet direction from parsec to kiloparsec scales is commonly observed in blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this misalignment could either be due to actual large bends in the jets , or due to small bends that are amplified by projection .",
    "we present the parsec- to kiloparsec - scale jet misalignment for the mojave sources in figure  [ fig : delta ] .",
    "the procedure for estimating the parsec - scale jet position angles ( pas ) is described in @xcite .",
    "kiloparsec - scale jet position angles were determined for the frii sources using the brightest hot spots , especially when no jet was clearly visible , under the assumption that the brightest hot spot indicates the approaching jet direction due to doppler boosting .",
    "the aips procedure tvmaxfit was used to obtain accurate peak pixel positions of the core and hot spot , which were then used in the aips verb imdist to obtain the jet position angle .",
    "for the fri - type sources we used tvmaxfit for the core pixel position , and the aips verb curvalue to get the pixel position roughly towards the center and end of the broad jet / lobe . finally imdist was used to obtain the jet position angle .",
    "note that unlike regular radio galaxies , fri blazars are typically one - sided , which makes the approaching jet direction easy to identify .",
    "due to the wide jet / lobes in fris , the kiloparsec - scale jet position angle could be uncertain by 10@xmath5 to 15@xmath5 .",
    "when a jet feature appeared only partially resolved ( @xmath11 1038 + 064 , 1417 + 385 ) , a two gaussian component model was used in jmfit to obtain pixel positions of the core and jet feature .",
    "we note that our approach ( @xmath11 of using the brightest hot spot to determine the approaching jet direction , when no jet was clearly visible ) differs from that adopted by some other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) who assume that , when no jet is visible , the hot spot on the side of the parsec - scale jet , represents the kiloparsec - scale jet direction .",
    "our approach has led us to identify many more sources ( @xmath58 ) with misalignment angles greater than 90@xmath5 .",
    "bump.,width=340 ]    for an otherwise straight jet having a single bend , the apparent bending angle ( @xmath59 ) is related to the intrinsic bending angle ( @xmath60 ) through the relation , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the angle to line of sight , and @xmath63 is the azimuth of the bend @xcite . the fact that we see a majority of sources having close to zero apparent misalignment implies one of the following scenarios : ( i ) the intrinsic misalignment angle is small ; ( ii ) both the intrinsic misalignment and jet inclination angles are large ; ( iii ) the azimuth of the bend is close to 180@xmath5 , @xmath45 the plane of the bend is perpendicular to the sky plane . since scenario ( ii )",
    "is unlikely for these blazars , possibilities ( i ) and ( iii ) are more favorable . in  4 ,",
    "we explain how the mojave selection criteria could make it biased towards bent jets .",
    "@xcite and @xcite reported an unexpected secondary peak at @xmath64pa = @xmath65 in the misalignment angle distribution .",
    "the signatures of a weak @xmath65 bump appear to be present in figure  [ fig : delta ] .",
    "@xcite concluded that while the largely aligned population could be explained by straight parsec - scale jets and small intrinsic bends between parsec- and kiloparsec - scales , the secondary peak sources must have gently curving ( low - pitch ) helical parsec - scale jets .",
    "this helical distortion could arise due to kelvin - hemlholtz instabilities or precession of the jet ejection axes .",
    "we reach a similar conclusion on the jet misalignments , following a different approach in  4.3 .",
    "the mojave survey appears to select many sources with intermediate radio powers and radio morphology ( e.g. , high radio power bl  lacs , some with hot spots , and low radio power quasars ) .",
    "this could be a result of the mojave selection criteria , which are based on the relativistically - boosted , high radio frequency ( 15  ghz ) parsec - scale flux densities .",
    "this would make it more likely to encompass a much larger range in intrinsic radio powers , compared to other samples selected on the basis of total kiloparsec - scale flux - densities ( e.g. , the 3cr sample ) .",
    "the intrinsic radio luminosity function derived for the mojave sample by @xcite also supports this view .",
    "furthermore , as the mojave survey picks up bright radio cores , most of the sources could either be fast jets pointed towards us , or curved / bent jets that have at least some portion of the jet aligned directly into our line of sight , at at least one epoch ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". the mojave survey could therefore be biased towards bent jets .",
    "note that in the wide angle tail quasars , the hot spots closer to the cores could be produced at the base of the plumes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or indicate a sharp bend in the jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we discuss the possibility of beamed wat quasars in the mojave sample further in  4.3 .",
    "since the mojave sample consists almost entirely of blazars , the sources are expected to have jets aligned close to our line of sight .",
    "our examination of orientation effects in the sample , however , using two different statistical orientation indicators , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , reveals that a range of orientations must in fact be present in order to account for several observed trends . @xmath3 and @xmath2 also reveal , to some extent , dissimilar trends .",

    "dense environments can decrease expansion losses in the source , but increase radiative losses , making the sources brighter at low radio frequencies ( e.g. , in cygnus a , see * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite found a similar lack of correlation between jet - to - counterjet misalignment and redshift for an frii radio galaxy sample .",
    "thus , the jet misalignment could also be related to factors closely associated with the agn itself . for instance , the presence of binary black holes or kicks imparted to the black hole via a black hole merger , could switch the ejection direction on a short timescale ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "the inverse relation suggests that jets with smaller misalignments ( @xmath45 straighter jets ) show signatures of greater environmental effects on their lobe emission",

    "if the latter is true , then this is an important caveat @xmath24 the environment indicator could also be affected by source orientation in blazars .",
    "however , the orientation - dependence alone can not satisfactorily explain the correlation between the environment indicator and redshift ( fig .",

    "@xcite demonstrated a tight correlation between emission - line luminosity and total jet kinetic power in a sample of radio - loud agns .",
    "this correlation was tighter than the one observed between emission - line luminosity and radio luminosity .",
    "@xcite discovered a large number of `` blue quasars '' with strong emission lines , but relatively low radio powers in the deep x - ray radio blazar survey ( dxrbs ) and the rgb samples , and suggested that this went against the close relationship between emission - line and jet power .",
    "these and other observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could be suggesting that the mechanism for the production of the optical - uv photons that ionise the emission - line clouds is decoupled from the mechanism that produces powerful radio jets .",
    "many mojave blazars also seem to not follow the relation between emission - line and radio luminosity ; that is , some quasars and bl  lacs have relatively low and high radio powers , respectively , and the suggestion of decoupled mechanisms might hold true .",
    "however , an alternate hypothesis by which their emission - line luminosity could still be correlated with their intrinsic jet kinetic power , could come about if the outlying bl  lac objects were present in dense confining environments , while the outlying quasars were old , field sources .",
    "confinement would increase the synchrotron radiative losses due to the amplification of the magnetic field strength , making the sources brighter ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while expansion losses and gradual radiative losses could presumably reduce the low frequency radio emission in the old , field quasars .",
    "it has been suggested that a large fraction ( @xmath8350% ) of the high redshift radio sources could be gps sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are likely to be present in confined environments .",
    "one of the highest redshift mojave sources , 0742 + 103 ( @xmath84 ) , is a gps quasar .",
    "there are several other mojave sources that have peaked spectra , but do not show the low - variability or the double - lobed parsec - scale structures that are characteristic of the gps class .",
    "these could be  masquerading gps \" sources , whose overall spectrum happens to be dominated by an unusually bright feature in the jet , located downstream from the core .      in order to gain more insight into the primary factors that drive the fr dichotomy , in this section we disregard the emission - line division ( i.e. , quasars , bl  lacs ) , and divide sources into fri , fri / ii and frii classes based solely on their 1.4  ghz extended powers ( following fig .  [ fig : z ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : env ] plots the environment indicator , @xmath4 , with respect to redshift , using the new classification .",
    "a quick comparison with fig .  [ fig : opt ] reveals that many of the low redshift quasars fall into the intermediate fri / ii class .",
    "the low redshifts of these sources discounts the possibility of a @xmath85 surface brightness dimming effect in them , which could potentially reduce their extended luminosity , making them fall in the intermediate luminosity class .",
    "this finding is consistent with the discovery of `` blue quasars '' by @xcite , which have radio powers and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) similar to the high energy peaked bl lacs .",
    "most beamed fris lie at redshifts below 0.5 in fig .",
    "[ fig : env ] .",
    "this could be a limitation of the flux limited sample .",
    "interestingly , the fri / ii sources lie at all redshift ranges , and throughout the @xmath4 distribution .",
    "this suggests that these `` intermediate '' luminosity sources are not produced as a result of different environmental conditions compared to , say , other friis .",
    "similarly , sources divided on the basis of the presence or absence of hot spots , show no discernable difference in the @xmath4 vs. @xmath86 plane .",
    "it is important to note that environmental radio boosting , as mentioned in  4.4 ( also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could be instrumental in blurring the fanaroff - riley dividing line in the mojave blazars .",
    "lastly , the orientation indicator , @xmath2 , seems to be correlated with misalignment only for friis , but not for fris or fri / iis ( table  [ tabcorrel ] ) .",
    "this implies that projection is playing a significant role in the jet misalignment of frii sources , but the jets are intrinsically more distorted in fris and fri / iis .",
    "a corollary to this is that the differences between fris and friis could be related to factors affecting the black hole spin direction , since we have previously concluded that jet mislignments appear to be largely unrelated to kiloparsec - scale environmental effects .",
    "six mojave sources ( @xmath11 0224 + 671 , 0814 + 425 , 1219 + 044 , 1510@xmath24089 , 1828 + 487 , 2145 + 067 ) have jet misalignments greater than 160@xmath5 . such extremely misaligned sources could be bent jets viewed nearly head - on , as suggested for the gamma - ray blazar pks 1510@xmath24089 @xcite .",
    "an alternate scenario could be that some of these misaligned sources are `` hybrid '' morphology sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "three of six sources with large misalignments ( @xmath11 0224 + 671 , 1219 + 044 , 1510@xmath24089 ) indeed seem to possess radio morphologies that could be classified as `` hybrid '' .",
    "the large misalignment then makes sense : the vlbi jet ( used to determine the parsec - scale jet position angle ) could be on the fri side , while the sole hot spot ( used to determine the kiloparsec - scale jet position angle ) could be on the frii side .",
    "one interesting source that shows extreme misalignment ( @xmath87 ) is m87 ( 1228 + 126 ) .",
    "m87 appears to exhibit a weak hot spot on the counterjet side ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the brightest emission on the counterjet side is at the extremity of the radio lobe ( like in friis ) , m87 could be classified as a hybrid radio morphology source .",

    "@xcite have observed a very short , weak radio counterjet on parsec - scales in m87 , but perhaps that is just a slower outer sheath that quickly terminates .",
    "if indeed some of the extremely misaligned sources are `` hybrid '' sources , the lack of a correlation between jet misalignment and environment appears to contradict the suggestion that asymmetries in galactic environments , which increase with redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "moreover , the fraction of such sources would be higher in the mojave ( @xmath90 ) , than that reported for the first survey ( 1% , * ? ? ?",

    "it is also interesting to note that not many mojave `` hybrid '' morphology sources fall in the fri / ii luminosity range , but rather have frii luminosities . in other words ,",
    "the mojave `` hybrid '' morphology sources are not necessarily `` hybrid '' in terms of radio power , but mostly fall into the frii luminosity class .",
    "chandra x - ray observations of these sources could resolve some of these apparent contradictions .",
    "about 7% of the mojave sources do not show any extended radio emission in our 1.4 ghz vla a - array images .",
    "however the ratio of their 5  ghz radio flux density to their b - band optical flux density is of the order of a few hundred , placing them firmly in the radio - loud agn class ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "while the core - only sources could have been affected by the redshift surface brightness dimming effect , our discussion in the previous section argues against this conjecture .",
    "alternatively , these sources could just be normal quasars at very small angles to line of sight , so that the vla resolution is insufficient to delineate the various components .",
    "this appears to be the case in 1038 + 064 , and 1417 + 385 , where a two gaussian component model fits the `` core '' emission better than a single one .",

    "<S> we present the results of a study on the kiloparsec - scale radio emission in the complete flux density limited mojave sample , comprising 135 radio - loud agns . </S>",
    "<S> new 1.4  ghz vla radio images of six quasars , and previously unpublished images of 21 blazars , are presented , along with an analysis of the high resolution ( vla a - array ) 1.4  ghz emission for the entire sample . while extended emission is detected in the majority of the sources , about 7% of the sources exhibit only radio core emission . </S>",
    "<S> we expect more sensitive radio observations , however , to detect faint emission in these sources , as we have detected in the erstwhile `` core - only '' source , 1548 + 056 . </S>",
    "<S> the kiloparsec - scale radio morphology varies widely across the sample . </S>",
    "<S> many bl lacs exhibit extended radio power and kiloparsec - scale morphology typical of powerful frii jets , while a substantial number of quasars possess radio powers intermediate between fris and friis . </S>",
    "<S> this poses challenges to the simple radio - loud unified scheme , which links bl  lacs to fris and quasars to friis . </S>",
    "<S> we find a significant correlation between extended radio emission and parsec - scale jet speeds : the more radio powerful sources possess faster jets . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the 1.4 ghz ( or low frequency ) radio emission is indeed related to jet kinetic power . </S>",
    "<S> various properties such as extended radio power and apparent parsec - scale jet speeds vary smoothly between different blazar subclasses , suggesting that , at least in terms of radio jet properties , the distinction between quasars and bl  lac objects , at an emission - line equivalent width of @xmath0 is essentially an arbitrary one . </S>",
    "<S> while the two blazar subclasses display a smooth continuation in properties , they often reveal differences in the correlation test results , when considered separately . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood if , unlike quasars , bl  lacs do not constitute a homogeneous population , but rather include both fri and frii radio galaxies for their parent population . </S>",
    "<S> it could also just be due to small number statistics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ratio of the radio core luminosity to the @xmath1-corrected optical luminosity ( @xmath2 ) appears to be a better indicator of orientation for this blazar sample , than the traditionally used radio core prominence parameter ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on the assumption that the extended radio luminosity is affected by the kiloparsec - scale environment , we define the ratio of extended radio power to absolute optical magnitude ( @xmath4 ) as a proxy for environmental effects . </S>",
    "<S> trends with this parameter suggest that the parsec - scale jet speeds and the parsec - to - kiloparsec jet misalignments are not affected by the large - scale environment , but are more likely to depend upon factors intrinsic to the agn , or its local parsec - scale environment . </S>",
    "<S> the jet speeds could , for instance , be related to the black hole spins , while jet misalignments could arise due to the presence of binary black holes , or kicks imparted to black holes via black hole mergers , consistent both with radio morphologies resembling precessing jet models observed in some mojave blazars , and the signature of a 90@xmath5 bump in the jet misalignment distribution , attributed to low - pitch helical parsec - scale jets in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that some of the extremely misaligned mojave blazar jets could be `` hybrid '' morphology sources , with an fri jet on one side and an frii jet on the other . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is tempting to speculate that environmental radio boosting ( as proposed for cygnus a ) could be responsible for blurring the fanaroff - riley dividing line in the mojave blazars , provided a substantial fraction of them reside in dense ( cluster ) environments . </S>"
