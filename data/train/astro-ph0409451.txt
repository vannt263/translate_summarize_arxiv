    "the present observed acceleration of the universe is due to a substance which we call dark energy , the nature of which is yet unknown .",
    "@xcite was the first to introduce the idea of the possible decay of dark energy .",
    "a recent review of possible explanations for the nature of dark energy and its possible decay can be found , for example , in @xcite . as noted by @xcite , the evolution of the dark energy density and its related coupling to matter or",
    "radiation is , in general , assigned and not derived from an action principle .",
    "discussions of this can be found in @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we assume that the dark energy is the vacuum energy and investigate its possible decay .",
    "some scalar field dark energy models , such as that of @xcite and @xcite , were motivated , in part , by particle physics and used observational data to constrain the decay rate of dark energy . however , in general , almost all studies of the decay of the dark energy , assuming that it is the vacuum energy , as is done in this paper , are purely phenomenological and do not put strong limits on the decay from observational data ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in a previous paper",
    ", we studied the limit put on the rate of a possible vacuum energy decay into cold dark matter ( cdm ) by the observed cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large galaxy survey data @xcite .",
    "the observed temperature fluctuations of the cmb photons @xmath5 are approximately proportional to cdm density fluctuations @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "cdm density fluctuations derived from the cmb data can be compared with those derived from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) @xcite .",
    "it was found that the @xmath6 derived from the galaxy distribution data differs from the @xmath7 derived from the cmb data by no more than 10 per cent ( see * ? ? ? * for the final data set of the 2dfgrs ) .",
    "a vacuum energy decaying into cdm increases its total density , diluting @xmath8 . in order to evaluate @xmath7 at the recombination era , when it created the @xmath9 of the cmb , its present measured value obtained from the galaxy distribution data",
    "must then be increased by a factor @xmath10 . since the @xmath6 derived from the cmb and galaxy distribution data",
    "agree to 10 per cent , the maximum value for @xmath10 is @xmath11 .",
    "we found that the decay of the vacuum energy into cdm as a scale factor power law @xmath12 , gives a maximum value for the exponent @xmath13 .",
    "for a parametrized vacuum decay into a cdm model with the form @xmath14\\ , [ \\left(1+z\\right)^{3(1-\\nu)}-1]\\ , \\,$ ] , where @xmath15 is the present critical density , an upper limit on the @xmath16 parameter was found to be @xmath17 .    here , we study the limit imposed on the rate of a possible decay of the vacuum energy into a homogeneous distribution of thermalized cmb photons . in this scenario",
    ", @xmath5 at the recombination epoch were diluted by photons created by a vacuum energy decay .",
    "thus , @xmath5 at present are smaller than those existing at the recombination era .",
    "this implies larger @xmath18 at the recombination era than those derived from the observed cmb data .",
    "we generally assume that the cmb temperature @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath20 in a friedmann - robertson walker ( frw ) universe .",
    "there is , however , little direct observational evidence for this relation despite considerable observational efforts to verify it . @xcite summarized some of the observational studies which have been made up to a redshift @xmath21 .",
    "although in the present paper , we investigate a possible decay of a homogeneous vacuum energy into a homogeneous distribution of photons , the vacuum energy may , in principle , not be homogeneous and its decay could then lead to an inhomogeneous distribution of photons .",
    "a vacuum energy depending on spatial position could be created , for example , by a casimir effect , such as that described by muller , fagundes and opher ( 2001,2002 ) .",
    "the inhomogeneous distribution of decay photons produced might be able to be detected in high precision cmb data .",
    "this possibility will be investigated in a future study .    in section",
    "ii , we put strong limits on the possible decay of the vacuum energy into a homogeneous distribution of thermalized cmb photons and its effect on @xmath6 derived from the observed cmb data .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section iii .",

    "let us examine a possible vacuum decay into photons .",
    "assuming that the decay is adiabatic , the vacuum energy decays into a homogeneous distribution of thermalized black body cmb photons .",
    "this was shown by @xcite , as follows .",
    "the conservation equation for the photon number density @xmath31 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the hubble parameter and @xmath34 is the photon source term .",

    ", we have @xmath42 . in order to have homogeneous equilibrium black body radiation , @xmath43",
    ", we must have @xmath44 or @xmath45 we then have @xmath46 thus , when the decay of the vacuum energy is adiabatic and the specific entropy does not change , we obtain a homogeneous thermal distribution of black - body radiation . from the conservation equation for the photon density , @xmath47 , and the above relation between @xmath41 and @xmath34",
    ", we have @xmath48 for @xmath49 ( no photon creation ) , we obtain the standard frw law relation , [ eq.([tempstan2 ] ) ] .",
    "it is to be noted that previous studies of the decay of the vacuum energy assumed that the decay rate into photons @xmath34 is proportional to some power of @xmath33 and/or the cosmic scale factor @xmath50 ( i.e. , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are constants ) .",
    "the combination of the values @xmath54 and @xmath55 , is especially interesting as it indicates an adiabatic decay of the vacuum energy into a homogeneous distribution of thermalized cmb photons .",
    "since @xmath31 is inversely proportional to @xmath56 , we have @xmath57 . defining @xmath58",

    "the recombination    temperature thus occurs at a higher @xmath64 .    due to the dilution of @xmath65 instead of eq.([zto1070 ] ) of the standard model , we must use the relation @xmath66 we define @xmath67 \\,\\big|_{{{z}_{\\rm rec}}}\\ , \\ , .",
