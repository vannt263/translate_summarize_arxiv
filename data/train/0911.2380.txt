    "driven elastic manifolds in disordered media have been used to model a number of physical systems ranging from crack propagation in solids @xcite to dynamics of magnetic domain walls in ferromagnets @xcite and vortices in type - ii superconductors @xcite , and to charge density waves @xcite .",
    "such systems exhibit non - equilibrium phase transitions as an external driving force @xmath4 is varied , so that below the depinning threshold @xmath5 the system is pinned by the disorder , while for @xmath6 the system moves at a finite average velocity . for @xmath4 close to but above @xmath5 , such motion typically occurs as a sequence of avalanches with a broad distribution of sizes . a large class of such systems ,",
    "including advancing crack fronts in solids @xcite , contact lines in wetting @xcite , magnetic domain walls with dipolar interactions @xcite , and plastically deforming crystals @xcite , is characterized by a long - range interaction kernel .",
    "the peculiarity of these systems is that due to the long - range interactions governing the avalanche dynamics , the area swept over by an avalanche is not necessarily simply connected in space as it would be the case if the interactions were only short - ranged . instead , _",
    "global avalanches _ are formed by a set of spatially disconnected _",
    "local clusters_.    the propagation of a planar crack confined in a weak plane represents an ideal system to realize experimentally the depinning transition predicted by the crack line model @xcite . yet , the first experimental results for the crack front roughness @xcite and for the avalanche size distribution @xcite disagreed with the theory .",
    "the roughness exponent of the crack front was found in the range @xmath7 @xcite , instead of the theoretical value @xmath8 @xcite , while the avalanche sizes defined by the waiting time matrix @xcite , measuring only spatially connected parts of the avalanches , were found experimentally to be power law distributed with an exponent much higher than the value predicted by the long - range line model for avalanches extracted by considering the global velocity signal of the crack front .",
    "these earlier claims have been revised recently : by testing a larger range of length scales it was shown that the roughness exponent would cross over to the theoretical value at sufficiently large scales @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the crack line model can reproduce the avalanche statistics of the experiment , if also the numerical data are analyzed using the waiting time matrix introduced in @xcite , while a smaller exponent value is obtained when considering avalanches extracted from the global velocity signal of the crack front model .",
    "still , a complete understanding of the origin of the different scaling exponents is lacking .",
    "here we clarify these issues by studying the statistics of global avalanches and their spatially connected parts , the local avalanches ( or clusters ) , for a long range elastic string moving in a disordered medium under _ quasi - static _ external driving .",
    "both the avalanche and cluster size distributions are found to exhibit scaling , but with different power law exponents .",
    "in particular , by studying the model with a larger range of length scales , we obtain a more accurate description of the scaling behavior , and therefore a better estimate of the related exponents than in previous numerical studies @xcite .",
    "these numerical results are compared with data from experiments on plexiglas plates @xcite , and excellent agreement is found .",
    "moreover , we propose a scaling relation between the power law exponents of the avalanche and cluster size distributions by considering the avalanche break - up process , supported by our numerical results .",
    "we finally study the morphology of the local clusters , and find that their aspect ratio scales with the roughness exponent of the line model above a cross - over length proportional to the larkin length of the crack front .",
    "previous studies @xcite using a continuous time version of the crack line model have presumably been sampling the short length scale regime .",
    "thus , our results explain and clarify a number of open issues related in particular to planar crack front propagation , such as the different scaling of global avalanches and local clusters , as well as the connection between roughness and avalanche morphology . however , the implications of our study extend beyond crack front propagation , as the results can be immediately extended to a number of other systems described by the same model , such as contact line dynamics in wetting @xcite , and low angle grain boundaries in crystalline solids @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a number of other driven systems in which the avalanche dynamics is governed by long range interactions , ranging from domain walls in ferromagnets with dipolar interactions @xcite to plastically deforming crystalline solids @xcite , are expected to obey similar scaling laws .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , the simulation model and the methods used to extract the local clusters from the simulations and the experiments are presented .",
    "these are then followed by the results of the numerical simulations along with a direct comparison with experimental results from plexiglas plates in section iii .",
    "section iv finishes the paper with conclusions and discussion .",
    "the model of the propagating planar crack front , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , is represented by a vector of integer heights @xmath9 , @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the system size .",
    "crack propagation is driven by the local stress intensity factor ( sif ) @xmath12 , which represents the asymptotic prefactor of the @xmath13 divergence of the stress field near the crack tip . to model the different contributions of the local sif",
    "@xmath12 acting on a front element @xmath14 , it is taken to be of the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 represents the first order variation of the stress intensity factor due to a first - order perturbation of the front position , @xmath17 is the front segment spacing and @xmath18 tunes the strength of the elastic interactions @xcite , @xmath19 is a time - independent gaussian random variable of zero mean and unit variance , with @xmath20 representing random toughness of the material , and @xmath21 is the contribution of the external load .",
    "notice that the long range kernel in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kernel ] ) is identical in many other problems , such as contact lines @xcite and low angle grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "the dynamics is defined in discrete time @xmath22 by setting @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the local velocity of the front element @xmath14 , and @xmath25 is the heaviside step function . during a single time step ,",
    "the front elements with @xmath26 are advanced by a unit step , @xmath27 , and new random forces are generated for those elements .",
    "the local forces are then computed again for each element , and the process is repeated until @xmath28 for all @xmath14 and the avalanche stops .",
    "the size @xmath29 of the avalanche is the total number of elementary moves during such an avalanche",
    ". then the external stress is increased so that exactly one of the elements becomes unstable , and a new avalanche is initiated . while such a discretization of the dynamics neglects the fact that the local velocity of the crack front should be proportional to the local sif , this is a standard technique employed in models of the depinning transition , going back to the work of leschhorn @xcite , and is known to have no influence on the scaling behavior we study here . moreover , this procedure is essential to be able to drive the system quasi - statically .",
    "such quasi - static driving has the advantage over continuous time models with a finite driving velocity @xcite that avalanches and clusters can be defined without ambiguity also for a zero threshold . as the crack front advances , the applied sif @xmath21 decreases at a rate proportional to the instantaneous average velocity @xmath30 of the front , with a proportionality constant @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the cut - off of the avalanche size distributions is expected to scale with @xmath31 @xcite .",
    ", for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with the area swept over by different avalanches denoted by different shades of gray ( time is running from black to white ) .",
    "* b ) * the same data as in * a ) * represented by the velocity matrix @xmath34 with a zero threshold .",
    "the crack front is moving to the positive @xmath35 direction .",
    "black corresponds to zero velocity , while regions of finite velocity are shown in white .",
    "* c ) * an example of a structure of a single avalanche as identified by the am method .",
    "* d ) * the same avalanche as in * c ) * extracted by using the wtm method.,width=302 ]      to extract the clusters from an avalanche , we use two methods .",
    "the first is the avalanche map ( am ) , based on a two dimensional array @xmath36 such that a unique value is assigned to all points @xmath37 over which an avalanche has swept .",
    "we then define the local cluster size @xmath38 as the area of spatially connected regions with the same value of @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] a and c ) .",
    "the second approach is the recently proposed waiting time matrix ( wtm ) @xmath39 , defined by the time the interface has spent within a pixel corresponding to the location @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the local velocity matrix is then given by @xmath34 .",
    "clusters are defined as spatially connected regions of area @xmath40 within which the local velocity exceeds some threshold value @xmath41 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : maps ] b and d ) . here",
    "we study the model in the quasi - static limit , which allows us to use effectively a zero threshold , by setting the waiting time of the pinned configurations separating avalanches to be much longer than the maximum avalanche duration .",
    "when using the wtm approach to record the motion of the crack front during an avalanche , only @xmath42 steps are recorded when a line element moves @xmath43 steps , as both the initial and final pinned configurations are classified as immobile .",
    "thus , the avalanche in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] d ) is a bit thinner in the @xmath35 direction as compared to the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] c ) , and parts of the avalanche involving motion of a single step forward only are lost completely . however , our results suggest that this does not affect the statistical properties of the clusters . in the case of the discrete line model ,",
    "another issue is that for soft lines ( @xmath44 ) , in which the height difference between neighboring segments of the line can be two or more pixels of the wtm , two consecutive avalanches can be recorded as one . in the following we use wtm only for large enough",
    "notice that the am does not suffer from such problems .",
    "the probability distributions of avalanches and cluster sizes for @xmath45 , @xmath33 and various values of @xmath31 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : global_dists ] and [ fig : local_dists ] , respectively . the sizes @xmath29 of the avalanches ( fig .",
    "[ fig : global_dists ] , open symbols ) are distributed according to a power law with a @xmath31-dependent cut - off , @xmath46 with @xmath47 a scaling function describing the shape of the cut - off , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is in good agreement with results from simulations @xcite and unpublished experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the scaling of the cut - off was not considered in ref .",
    "notice that the scaling function @xmath47 displays a bump around the cut - off of the distribution @xcite , and thus the true power law exponent can be seen directly only for @xmath29 well below the cut - off scale .",
    "the exponent values we quote are obtained by optimizing the data collapse of the distributions . to demonstrate the robustness of our results with respect to changing the values of various parameters of the model",
    ", we also show the avalanche size distributions for a fixed @xmath31 but varying @xmath18 in fig .",
    "[ fig : global_dists ] ( filled symbols ) : the distributions turn out to be virtually independent of @xmath18 in the range @xmath50 considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : global_dists ] .",
    "analogously , the cluster sizes or areas @xmath38 ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : local_dists ] ) and @xmath40 ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : local_dists ] ) extracted by the am and wtm methods , respectively , are both observed to scale according to @xmath51 but with an exponent @xmath2 significantly different from @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the two methods to define the clusters give the same @xmath2-exponent within errorbars . in this case",
    "the scaling function @xmath54 does not exhibit a bump , and the scaling of the distributions extends all the way to the cut - off scale .",
    "also for the cluster size distributions similar results are obtained for different values of @xmath18 ( not shown ) .",
    "the observed exponent value is somewhat lower than that quoted in refs .",
    "@xcite for the wtm approach , but our analysis below indicates that also the data presented in @xcite is perfectly consistent with @xmath55 .",
    "this is because in refs .",
    "@xcite also the region of the cut - offs of the distributions was included in the fits , thus overestimating the true exponent value .",
    "notice also that the cut - off of the cluster size distributions scales with @xmath31 as @xmath56 , with @xmath57 for the am approach , while we obtain @xmath58 for the wtm .",
    "the different @xmath59 exponents have the same value within errorbars , and we suspect that the small variation observed might be related to a finite size effect .      in order to compare directly our results to the experiments @xcite , we study wtm clusters as a function of a finite velocity threshold @xmath41 .",
    "the threshold introduces a cut - off in the distribution that scales as @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : edists ] .",
    "there , we compare the simulation results with experimental data on planar crack propagation in plexiglas plates @xcite",
    ". both sets of data can be collapsed by using exponent values @xmath63 and @xmath64 . by shifting the two data collapses on top of each other ,",
    "we observe perfect agreement between the simulations and the experiment .",
    "notice again that in refs .",
    "@xcite , the cut - offs of the distributions were included in the power law fits , thus overestimating the true exponent value .      to explain these results , we consider the break - up process of an avalanche into a number of clusters .",
    "when an avalanche grows by one unit ( i.e. when a single element of the line moves forward by one unit ) , there are three possibilities how this can affect the number @xmath65 of distinct clusters within an avalanche : i ) a new cluster is initiated ( @xmath66 ) , ii ) two existing clusters are merged into a single cluster ( @xmath67 ) , or iii ) an existing cluster grows by one unit ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "we associate probabilities @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively , to these events .",
    "these probabilities are dynamic variables as they depend on the instantaneous structure of the avalanche . on the average ,",
    "however , @xmath72 as @xmath73 would clearly indicate an increase in @xmath70 and a subsequent tendency for @xmath69 to decrease again : when the number of clusters grows , there is less and less space to create more clusters and the probability to merge existing clusters should increase .",
    "similarly , @xmath74 would imply that sooner or later most of the clusters would have merged , and consequently the probability @xmath70 for further cluster merging decreases .",
    "thus , for large enough avalanches , the number @xmath75 of clusters during the growth of an avalanche follows a random walk up to @xmath29 steps , with a reflective boundary at @xmath76 ( as each avalanche consists of at least one cluster ) .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the process is not correlated indicates that for @xmath77 , @xmath78 , with @xmath79 .",
    "our numerical results confirm this relation , and a scaling form @xmath80 with @xmath81 a scaling function , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sqrt ] ( i.e. the cut - off scales with @xmath31 again with the same exponent @xmath84 ) .",
    "thus , the cluster sizes scale as @xmath85 , or @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 then implies that @xmath88 , with @xmath89 in the present case , the value of the avalanche exponent @xmath90 yields @xmath63 for the clusters , in good agreement with our numerical and recent experimental results @xcite .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq : sqrt_form ] ) implies that @xmath86 holds only for @xmath29 smaller than the cut - off scale . for larger avalanches",
    "one has @xmath91 ( as evidenced by the cross - over to a plateau in fig .",
    "[ fig : sqrt ] ) , consistent with the observation that the cut - offs of the avalanche and cluster size distributions scale with the same exponent @xmath59 .",
    "notice also that while deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : sr ] ) we did not make assumptions about the precise form of the long - range kernel nor the spatial dimension of the system , and we thus expect eq .",
    "( [ eq : sr ] ) to be valid for a wide class of avalanching systems where the avalanche dynamics is governed by long - range interactions .",
    "notice that if the avalanche break - up process is correlated such that @xmath78 with @xmath92 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sr ] ) can be generalized to read @xmath93 .      in experiments",
    "@xcite and simulations @xcite it was found that the aspect ratio of the clusters was scaling as @xmath94 , with @xmath95 and where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the linear sizes of the cluster in the @xmath98 and @xmath35 directions , respectively .",
    "this result is in agreement with the roughness of the crack front measured in early experiments , but disagrees with the known value of the roughness exponent of the crack line model @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "moreover , by investigating a larger range of length scales , a recent experimental work on roughness of the crack front has shown a crossover from a roughness exponent of around 0.6 to a lower value corresponding to the line model prediction of around 0.39 @xcite .",
    "this is surprising , since we have just shown that the experimental avalanche statistics is in perfect agreement with the predictions of the model .",
    "this puzzle can be resolved , noticing that @xmath99 is expected to hold only for length scales larger than the larkin length @xmath100 @xcite , which for our model scales like @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the correlation length and the amplitude of the disorder ( here @xmath104 ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "below @xmath100 , the crack line roughness should scale with an exponent @xmath105 .    in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : roughness ] we report the scaling of @xmath97 with @xmath96 for different values of @xmath18 . by rescaling @xmath96 by @xmath106",
    ", we observe a crossover for the scaling exponent going from @xmath107 at small scales to @xmath108 at large scales . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : roughness ] we also report the scaling of the root mean square height fluctuations @xmath109 ( with @xmath110 ) of the crack front , expected to scale like @xmath111 . again , by rescaling @xmath112 by @xmath113 , we observe a crossover from a small scale regime with @xmath114 to the large scale value @xmath115 .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : roughness ] shows that similar conclusion can be made by considering the power spectrum @xmath116 of the line profile , expected to scale as @xmath117 . rescaling the data by @xmath106 according to @xmath118",
    ", we observe a crossover for the scaling exponent going from @xmath119 for large @xmath120 to @xmath121 for small @xmath120 , in agreement with the analysis of root mean square height fluctuations .",
    "we have verified that in the present model , where the crack front is constrained to move along the @xmath35 direction , there is no multiscaling @xcite .",
    "notice that while we observe different crossover scales for the roughness of the line and the scaling of the morphology of the clusters , both sets of data scale with the larkin length @xmath100 , and thus the cross - over length is proportional to @xmath100 in both cases .",
    "however , the fact that these two length scales are not the same implies that there is a range of scales for which the roughness of the line appears to scale with the asymptotic exponent @xmath122 , while the cluster aspect ratio is still characterized by the larger @xmath123 .",
    "it is probably this range of scales that has been investigated in earlier numerical studies @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have demonstrated how avalanches are broken into spatially disconnected clusters in systems with long range interactions .",
    "both the avalanches as a whole and their localized parts or clusters exhibit scaling , but with different power law exponents , related by a scaling relation derived from a simple random walk argument for the avalanche break - up process .",
    "we also showed that large enough clusters exhibit aspect ratio scaling with an exponent consistent with the roughness exponent of the crack line model @xcite . due to the general nature of both the model considered as well as our arguments",
    ", we expect these results to be applicable in a large class of avalanching systems with long range interactions , ranging from crack propagation to contact lines in wetting to domain walls in ferromagnets .    of particular interest here",
    "is our explanation of the different scaling exponents observed for global avalanches and local clusters in the crack line model @xcite , and its potential implications for further studies of avalanche phenomena in systems with long - range interactions .",
    "an interesting prospect would be to explore the possibilities to explain the observed acoustic emission exponents in peeling of paper sheets @xcite with similar arguments .",
    "the observation that the avalanche break - up process in the line model can be described by a simple random walk will be interesting to test in experiments on crack front propagation in plexiglas plates , but also in other avalanching systems with long range interactions , such as for domain wall dynamics in ferromagnetic thin films @xcite , as well as for imbibition @xcite .",
    "an important point regarding the roughness of the crack front and the related cluster morphology is that their scaling properties depend on the range of length scales considered : the asymptotic scaling is observed only for length scales larger than a cross - over scale proportional to the larkin length of the crack line .",
    "earlier simulations @xcite as well as experiments @xcite have most likely been probing the regime below this cross - over scale , possibly explaining the different exponent values observed in those cases",
    ". however , for these small length scales additional complications arise due to the overhangs observed in the experimental crack profiles , which are excluded by construction in the present line model .",
    "such overhangs might be responsible for the multiscaling observed for the experimental crack profiles for short length scales @xcite .",
    "we are working to extend the crack front line model to include the possibility to form overhangs , and are planning to check if such an extension is sufficient to reproduce the experimentally observed short length scale scaling properties of the crack fronts .",
    "the connection between avalanches and clusters in avalanching systems with long - range interactions opens up also interesting possibilities to understand the observed spatio - temporal correlations between avalanches in a number of systems , such as the space - time coupling of avalanches observed in plastically deforming crystals @xcite , and even the fore- and aftershock sequences of earthquakes : one possibility worth further studies would be to check if such correlated avalanches could in fact be local clusters , with the observed correlations arising naturally from the fact that the localized clusters are parts of the same global avalanche",
