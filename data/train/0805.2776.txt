    "<S> we calculate the lateral casimir force exactly in terms of a single integral which we evaluate numerically . </S>",
    "<S> exact results for the case of the weak limit allows us to estimate the error in the perturbative results . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the error in the lateral casimir force , in the weak coupling limit , when the next - to - leading order contribution is included is remarkably low when the corrugation amplitudes are small in comparison to corrugation wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> we expect similar conclusions to hold for the dirichlet case . the analogous calculation for the electromagnetic case should reduce the theoretical error sufficiently for comparison with the experiments . </S>"
