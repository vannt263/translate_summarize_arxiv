    "tungsten has been chosen as the plasma facing material that will compose the divertor in the upcoming experimental fusion reaction iter .",
    "the reasons for this are threefold ; tungsten has a high melting point , it is resistant to absorption of tritium , and is also able to withstand with large power loads . in preparation for iter , the joint european torus ( jet )",
    "has been fitted with a beryllium wall and tungsten divertor ( @xcite ) .",
    "this experimental setup is referred to as the iter - like wall ( ilw ) .",
    "recent experiments with the ilw have shown reduced absorption of tritium as expected , but they have also shown that this configuration reduces the pedestal temperature in the tokamak from @xmath0kev to @xmath1ev ( @xcite ) .",
    "being a plasma - facing component , tungsten will be sputtered into the divertor plasma , and will make its way into the main body plasma .",
    "this can potentially cool the plasma , leading to disruption and quenching . in order to understand the effect this impurity has on the plasma , detailed collisional - radiative ( cr ) modelling",
    "is required . the major caveat to this , however , is the provision of detailed , partial and total dielectronic recombination ( dr ) rate coefficient data .",
    "this requirement has spurred multiple efforts to calculate such data .",
    "@xcite calculated dr rate coefficient data for the isonuclear sequence of tungsten using flychk , which uses the average - atom method ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite used adpak ( @xcite ) , which is based on the average - atom method also . in order to improve agreement with observation , the authors scaled the adpak rates for certain w stages .",
    "finally , @xcite covered the isonuclear sequence using the burgess general formula ( @xcite ) .",
    "in both the ptterich and foster isonuclear data , radiative recombination data was calculated using scaled hydrogenic values . in figure [ fig : ionbalputfos ] we have plotted the steady state ionization balance for tungsten using ionization rate coefficients from @xcite , and the recombination rate coefficients of ptterich and foster .",
    "it can be seen that large discrepancies exist for both the peak abundance temperatures , and the individual ionization fractions .",
    "in addition to isonuclear sequence work , several groups have also calculated detailed dr rate coefficients for individual ions . while not a complete list , a few examples are that of @xcite , who use the flexible atomic code ( @xcite ) to calculate level - resolved dr rate coefficients for w@xmath2  w@xmath3 , @xcite who used hullac ( @xcite ) to calculate w@xmath4 , and @xcite who also used hullac to calculate w@xmath5 . again using hullac ,",
    "@xcite , and @xcite considered dr of w@xmath6 .",
    "in addition , @xcite have used the autostructure code ( @xcite ) to calculate dr rate coefficients for w@xmath5  w@xmath7 .",
    "autostructure has been experimentally verified in previous works such as @xcite .",
    "as final - state - resolved partial dr rate coefficient data is only available for a handful of ions , we have launched _ the tungsten project_. the project will aim to calculate dr rate coefficients to as high an accuracy as possible for the entire isonuclear sequence of tungsten . in these proceedings",
    ", we will describe _ the tungsten project _",
    ", detailing calculational methods , and the data that will be generated .",
    "we conclude with a few remarks and the future work we plan to do .",
    "as a technical point , different ionisation stages of tungsten will be referred to by the number of valence electrons present in said ion .",
    "for example , h - like ( one electron ) becomes 01-like , and si - like ( 14 electrons ) becomes 14-like .",
    "a detailed description of the calculational method can be found in @xcite , however , we provide a brief summary here .",
    "all calculations were carried out using the distorted wave code autostructure ( @xcite ) .",
    "autostructure is able to calculate energy levels , oscillator strengths , photoionization cross sections , and many other quantities .",
    "these quantites can be calculated with level resolution ( intermediate coupling ic ) , term resolution ( ls coupling ) , or configuration resolution ( configuration average ca ) using semi - relativistic kappa - averaged wavefunctions .",
    "we label our dr rate coefficient calculations for each ion by the core excitation considered , which is described by the initial and final @xmath8 of the dr process ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively ) . as an example ,",
    "a core excitation with @xmath11 and @xmath12 is labeled as 34 .",
    "to decide which core excitations should be calculated in ic for a particular ion , we first calculate them in ca and compare their contribution to the overall total .",
    "if it exceeds 5% , we perform the calculation in ic .",
    "in addition to calculating dr rate coefficients , we also calculate radiative recombination ( rr ) rate coefficients , which are important for 00-like to 18-like . in figure [ fig : rates ] we give an example of calculated ic dr / rr rate coefficients for 15-like tungsten .",
    "the figure also shows the cumulative fraction , which shows the relative contribution of each core excitation and the rr rate coefficient to the total recombination rate coefficient .",
    "the largest contribution is given first , followed by the largest plus the second largest , and so on .",
    "[ [ dr ] ] dr ~~    the rydberg electron dr is calculated for each explicit principal quantum number @xmath8 up to @xmath13 , after which it is then calculated for @xmath8 on a logarithmic scale up to @xmath14 .",
    "interpolation is then used to calculate dr for intermediate values of @xmath8 .",
    "angular momenta @xmath15 for each @xmath8 are calculated up to a maximum value such that the dr rate coefficients are numerically converged to @xmath16% over the entire adas temperature range @xmath17k , where @xmath18 is the residual charge . for @xmath8 values greater than @xmath19 autostructure approximates a bound wavefunction @xmath20 by a zero energy continuum wavefunction @xmath21 using the result ( @xcite ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the quantum defect .",
    "this approach allows the hamiltonian to be diagonalized for all @xmath8 and to allow for the opening up of new auger channels at high @xmath8 .    the configurations for the n - electron target consist of all single excitations from each subshell .",
    "the n+1 configurations are simply the n - electron configurations with an additional electron . in table",
    "[ table : conf ] we include an example of the configurations used for 15-like 33 .",
    "mixing configurations are also included by way of the `` one up - one down '' rule , as these configurations are typically close to each other in terms of energy , and hence mix strongly .    [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ [ rr ] ] rr ~~    as with dr , the rydberg electron rr is calculated for each @xmath8 up to @xmath13 , and then logarithmically up to @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 are included relativistically up to @xmath26 , after which a non - relativistic top - up up to @xmath27 is added .",
    "this is sufficient to converge bare - like rr to @xmath16% over the adas temperature range as given above .",
    "the n - electron configurations used for rr calculations resemble that of the @xmath28 core excitations for dr .",
    "all possible excitations of the outermost electron are included plus mixing .",
    "again , the n+1 configurations are just the n - electron configurations plus an electron .",
    "the rr rate coefficients include multipolar radiation contributions up to e40 and m39 .",
    "in figure [ fig : ionbalprefos ] we compare the ionization balance calculated using the @xcite recombination data , and our present calculations .",
    "both recombination data sets use the ionization rate coefficients of @xcite . for our ionization balance , we include data up to 18-like , after which we use @xcite s data to 74-like .",
    "we can see that the agreement between our ionization balance and @xcite s is generally poor , but consistently so up to 10-like .",
    "this is because the contribution from dr is small compared to that of rr from 01-like ( @xmath29% ) .",
    "this contribution from dr gradually increases until it becomes comparable to rr at 10-like , and goes on the exceed this as the residual charge of the ion decreases .",
    "another factor causing the difference is the application of the jttner relativistic correction to the dr / rr rate coefficients for our calculation , but not that of foster s .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , dr of 10-like tungsten has been considered by @xcite and @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : necomp ] we compare the total dr rate coefficients calculated in this work with the data calculated by behar and safronova .",
    "it can be seen that our rate coefficients sit somewhere between the two .",
    "typically , the difference between our rate coefficients and behar s do not exceed 10% at peak abundance temperature , whereas the difference is typically @xmath30% when comparing to safronova s data .",
    "these differences may arise due to the way the higher-@xmath8 dr is calculated . in the case of behar s and safronova s data , radiative and auger rates are calculated up to a nominal value of @xmath8 ( typically 815 ) , which are then extrapolated up to @xmath31 .",
    "this extrapolation method may miss additional auger channels opening - up at higher-@xmath8 , whereas our method described previously allows for their inclusion in the calculation . in the future",
    ", it will be prudent to assess the sensitivity of the extrapolation method to the final explicit @xmath8 calculated before extrapolation is used .",
    "to date , we have completed calculations for 01-like to 37-like .",
    "calculations are currently ongoing for 38-like  57-like .",
    "all data that will be generated will be hosted on the open - adas website in the standard _",
    "adf09 _ and _ adf48 _ formats . in these proceedings",
    "we have introduced _ the tungsten project _ , and have described its aims , and the data that will be produced .",
    "we have used autostructure to calculate partial dr / rr rate coefficient data for ionization stages 01-like  37-like tungsten .",
    "one paper has been published covering 01-like  18-like , and we are currently writing a second paper for 19-like  36-like .",
    "we are currently conducting calculations covering the @xmath32 and @xmath33 shells , and expect these to be completed in a timely fashion .",
    "we are aiming to calculate updated cr models incorporating the new data described here .",
    "this work was supported by the engineering and physical sciences research council ( epsrc ) , grant no .",
