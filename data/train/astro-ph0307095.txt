    "the pleiades is the archetypal stellar sample with age @xmath6 myr and near - solar photospheric metallicity .",

    "cluster members cover spectral types from late - b to late - m , enabling the simultaneous study of the different processes driving x - ray emission from stars of different internal structure .",
    "solar - like stars ( spectral types @xmath7 f5m3 ) have radiative cores and convective outer envelopes , and x - ray emission is believed to be from hot plasma confined in magnetic loops in the corona , strong magnetic field being generated by a dynamo located at the base of the convection zone ( @xmath8 dynamo : parker 1975 ) , as on the sun .",
    "supportive correlations of increasing coronal x - ray and chromospheric line ( e.g. h@xmath9 , ca ii h , k ) luminosities with increasing convection zone depth and increasing rotation rates have been well - observed ( pallavicini et  al .  1981 ; noyes et  al .",
    "1984 ; pizzolato et  al .",
    "2003 ) , although the saturation of these `` magnetic activity indicators '' at high rotation rates , at an x - ray - to - bolometric luminosity ratio of @xmath10 @xmath11 ( vilhu 1984 ) , awaits a full explanation .",
    "x - ray luminosities , , may exceed @xmath12 times that of the sun at the peak of its activity cycle and younger stellar samples show higher mean as rotation rates slow with time through the braking effect of a magnetized stellar wind .",
    "the youth of the pleiades ensures a number of `` ultra - fast - rotating '' solar - like members ( ufrs ) , showing saturated levels of magnetic activity , of which there are few examples in the nearby field .    the sun s x - ray - emitting corona is highly variable and highly - structured .",
    "stellar x - ray emission is also highly variable , exhibiting flares with profiles echoing those seen on the sun , though reaching peak up to @xmath12 times higher .",
    "x - ray telescopes can not resolve stellar coronae into active regions and individual loops as seen on the sun , but loop sizes may be inferred from analysis of flare decays ( reale & micela 1998 ) .",
    "loop lengths a large fraction of , but smaller than , the stellar radius have been derived from flares observed on a small number of nearby solar - like stars ( e.g. maggio et  al .",
    "2000 ; gdel et  al .  2001 ; covino et  al .",
    "younger , faster - rotating , samples show flares of higher peak and with higher frequency ( stelzer , neuhuser & hambaryan 2000 ) , hence the pleiades is a good target for the study of stellar flares and coronal structure .",
    "the temperature structure and composition of some stellar coronae diverge from those of the solar corona .",
    "therein , the bulk of x - ray - emitting plasma is at 12 mk ( e.g. orlando , peres & reale 2000 ) , though flaring plasma is often as hot as 10 mk ( reale , peres & orlando 2001 ) , while faster - rotating stars have more plasma at higher temperatures ( e.g. gdel , guinan & skinner 1997 ) , with the most active stars having much plasma at 20 mk ( e.g. mewe et  al .",
    "elemental abundances in the solar corona differ from those in its photosphere ( so - called _ solar abundances _ ) , elements with low first ionization potential ( fip ) , such as fe , appearing _ overabundant _ ( meyer 1985 ) , although variability occurs with location within the corona ( mckenzie & feldman 1992 ) and during flares ( reames , meyer & von rosenvinge 1994 ) . in the coronae of highly - active solar - like stars , however , low - fip elements appear _ underabundant _ ( e.g. singh et  al .",
    "1999 ) , and the fip - dependence of coronal abundances changes according to activity level ( audard & gdel 2002 ) .",
    "the proximity of the pleiades enables the study of temperature structure and composition in coronae of a number of individual solar - like stars , helping to extend the relatively small sample of coronae in which these physical conditions have been measured .",
    "while solar - like stars have hot coronae and early - type ( @xmath13 b3 ) stars are thought to generate x - rays via hot shocks within their massive stellar winds , stars of intermediate type ( @xmath7b4f4 ) lack both a deep convective envelope and a massive stellar wind and are thus generally considered incapable of strong x - ray emission : any observed is conventionally attributed to a later - type companion with a hot corona ( e.g. golub et  al .",
    "1983 ; micela et  al .  1996 ; 1999 ) , although in most cases such a companion remains undiscovered .",
    "intermediate - type pleiads , relatively close and well - studied for binarity , provide a good sample in which to test this assertion .    the x - ray emission from low - mass stars ( spectral types @xmath14 m3 ) , which are thought to be fully - convective and hence unable to support an @xmath8 dynamo , is examined in a companion paper ( briggs & pye 2003 ) .",

    "gagn , caillault & stauffer ( 1995 ; henceforth gcs95 ) analysed the individual spectra of x - ray - bright pleiads ( @xmath15@xmath16 ) and the composite spectra of samples subdivided by spectral type ( f , g , k , m ) and into slow ( @xmath17 @xmath18 ) and fast ( @xmath17 @xmath19 ) rotators . only among g stars",

    "we use the _ xmm - newton _ epic cameras to perform spectral and timing analyses of stars of spectral types b  k in a single 15 arcmin - radius field in the core of the pleiades , with the aims : ( a ) to estimate temperature structure and metallicity and , through analysis of the decays of large flares , loop size in the coronae of individual solar - like pleiads and hence compare these properties to those of well - studied coronae of nearby solar - like stars ; and ( b ) to see if x - ray emission from intermediate - type stars is consistent with emission from the coronae of later - type companions .",
    "dlg02 addressed similar questions using their 60-ks _ chandra _ study of a neighbouring field .",
    "while the better angular resolution of _ chandra _ offered lower background count - rates , our _ xmm - newton _ observation adds to this study by sampling a more - complete range of spectral types , providing more counts per source to enable better - constrained spectral modelling , expanding the sample of well - studied x - ray - detected intermediate - type pleiads and being able to analyse large flares .",

    "however , one must conclude that even if such a planet was to exist , its total eclipse of a flaring loop would be a highly fortuitous event .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the flare was obscured by cool material passing across the line of sight , as proposed by haisch et  al .",

    "this is two orders of magnitude greater than has been seen in solar prominences , the proxima centauri event , or cool clouds in the atmosphere of ab dor that have been inferred from transient h@xmath9 absorption profiles ( collier cameron et  al .",
    "1990 ) . while the size of the ab dor clouds ( area @xmath180 @xmath178 ) is comparable to that required by our eclipse profile , their velocities , held to the rotation of the star at around the corotation radius , @xmath181300 ,",
    "are not analogous to the velocity of @xmath182 150500 required of our obscuring cloud , as @xmath17 is only 5 for hii  1100 . while such high velocities are fairly common in erupting prominences on the sun ( e.g. gopalswamy et  al .",
    "2003 ) , and the bulk kinetic energy of the cloud is around the same order of magnitude as ( 0.055 times ) the total energy , @xmath183 erg , radiated by the flare with which it is presumably associated , it would be puzzling if such a flare , which is a routine twice - a - day occurance on ab dor , was associated with such an extraordinarily denser cloud .",
    "a third explanation is that the large flare , with an impulsive , short rise - time , is shortly preceeded by a smaller flare ( albeit , with peak @xmath184 , still larger than the flares exhibited by hii  1516 and 1280 ) with a shorter decay time than rise time .",
    "evidence for a further flare - like event occurring during the flare decay , at @xmath185 ks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_lc]f ) supports the idea of multiple flaring within a complex active region .",
    "if we apply the hydrodynamic model with @xmath186 mk , the fast decay , @xmath187 s , indicates a loop structure , @xmath188 cm @xmath189 , smaller than that of the larger flare that followed , though similar to that inferred from a flare with peak @xmath190 , observed on a component of the dme binary yy gem ( stelzer et  al .",

    "the coincidence of two flares  the first unusual , the second impulsive  in such a way as to mimic an eclipse forms a somewhat _ ad hoc _ explanation of the feature , but none of the available hypotheses presents a convincing explanation on the grounds of probability and/or precedent .",
    "a planetary eclipse is the most interesting possibility and the only one that may be confirmed or refuted by further observations .",
    "intermediate - type stars ( @xmath7b4f4 ) are believed to lack both the massive stellar wind and deep convective envelope intrinsic to the x - ray generation mechanism of early - type and solar - like stars respectively .",
    "indeed , most x - ray surveys of a - type stars in the field and in open clusters have found a paucity of detections ( e.g. schmitt et  al .",

    "2002 ) . in the hyades , a sharp fall in chromospheric emission is observed to occur at spectral type f5 , which coincides with a sharp fall in rotation velocity ( bhm - vitense et  al .",
    "it is possible that dynamo - driven coronal",
    "x - ray emisson extends to spectral types some subclasses earlier than f5 .",
    "95 percent of all f - type stars within 13 pc of the sun were detected by _",

    "<S> we present results of x - ray spectral and timing analyses of solar - like ( spectral types f5k8 ) and intermediate - type ( b4f4 ) pleiads observed in a @xmath0-ks _ xmm - newton _ epic exposure , probing x - ray luminosities ( ) up to a factor 10 fainter than previous studies using the _ rosat _ pspc . </S>",
    "<S> all 8 solar - like members have `` quasi - steady '' @xmath1 consistent with the known rotation  activity relation , and 4 exhibit flares . using a hydrodynamic modelling technique we derive loop half - lengths @xmath2 for the two strongest flares , on hii  1032 and hii  1100 . </S>",
    "<S> near the beginning of its flare , hii  1100 s lightcurve shows a feature with a profile suggestive of a total occultation of the flaring loop . </S>",
    "<S> eclipse by a substellar companion in a close orbit is possible but would seem an extraordinarily fortuitous event ; absorption by a fast - moving cloud of cool material requires @xmath3 at least two orders of magnitude greater than any solar or stellar prominence . </S>",
    "<S> an occultation may have been mimicked by the coincidence of two flares , though the first , its decay time shorter than its rise time and suggestive of @xmath4 , would be unusual .    </S>",
    "<S> spectral modelling of the quasi - steady emission shows a rising trend in coronal temperature from f and slowly - rotating g stars through k stars to fast - rotating g stars , and a preference for low coronal metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> these features are consistent with those of nearby solar - like stars , although none of the three stars showing `` saturated '' emission bears the significant component at 2 kev seen in the saturated coronae of ab  dor and 47  cas . </S>",
    "<S> of 5 intermediate - type stars , 2 are undetected ( @xmath5 ) and 3 show x - ray emission with a spectrum and consistent with origin from an active solar - like companion .    </S>",
