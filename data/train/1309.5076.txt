    "as computers become more powerful , there is a move to numerically simulate larger and larger model networks of neurons @xcite . while simulation is useful for confirming observed behavior it is not as helpful in determining the mechanisms underlying the behavior .",
    "the tools of dynamical systems theory , such as bifurcation analysis can be useful in this regard when studying single neuron or small network models .",
    "however , they are not viable for large networks , especially if the neurons are not identical .",
    "thus , a common approach is to try to extrapolate large network behavior from detailed analysis of the behavior of individual cells or small networks @xcite .",
    "this can be problematic as networks can have behavior that is not present in individual cells .",
    "for example , individual neurons that are only capable of tonic firing when isolated may burst when coupled in a network @xcite .",
    "further , large networks may exhibit behavior not present in smaller networks .",
    "for example , dur - e - ahmad et al . studied bursting in networks ranging in size from 2 cells to 100 .",
    "they found that bursting occurred in a larger range of parameters for larger networks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 7 ) .    given the role of bursts in networks of neurons ,",
    "it is important to understand how a network transitions ( bifurcates ) from a non - bursting behavior , to bursting .",
    "bursting has been suggested to be a fairly important and information dense firing mode for neurons .",
    "for example , single bursts can induce long term potentiation and depression in the hippocampus , which are important proccesses for learning and memory @xcite .",
    "additionally , bursts have been found to carry more information about an animals position in space then isolated spikes alone as place fields have been found to be more accurately defined when considering bursts alone @xcite . additionally , the mechanism we analyze in this paper , adaptation induced bursting has also been suggested as a biologically plausible mechanism for the generation of grid cells via oscillatory interference of the bursting @xcite . however , adaptation induced bursting is a network level phenomenon and we can not apply bifurcation analysis directly to a network of adapting neurons .",
    "mean - field theory offers one approach to bridge this gap . in applying this theory ,",
    "one usually derives ( or suggests ) a low dimensional system of differential equations that govern the moments of different variables across the network @xcite .",
    "for example , for a network of all - to - all coupled izhikevich neurons @xcite , one can derive a two dimensional system of differential equations for the mean adaptation variable , and the mean synaptic gating variable @xcite .",
    "mean - field systems enable one to conduct network level bifurcation analysis and hence to test different hypotheses about large network behavior .",
    "for example , hemond et al .",
    "@xcite found that when uncoupled , the majority of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in region ca3 do not display bursting .",
    "this is contradictory to the observation that burst firing is ubiquitous this region ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.3.5 ) .",
    "a possible explanation for these contradictory observations is that bursting is a network level phenomenon .",
    "this hypothesis has been tested using bifurcation analysis of the mean - field system derived from a network of izhikevich neurons @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown that for a network of identical all - to - all coupled neurons fit to experimental data from @xcite for ca3 pyramidal cells , bursting occurs for a large range of synaptic conductances and applied currents if the spike frequency adaptation in the neurons is sufficiently strong .",
    "hemond et al .",
    "@xcite also observed that the pyramidal neurons in their study were heterogeneous , in particular , the neurons had different degrees of spike frequency adaptation . when the study of @xcite was extended to a network of two homogeneous subpopulations of hippocampal neurons with different degrees of spike frequency adaptation ,",
    "the mean - field equations predict , and numerical simulations confirm , that the region in the parameter space where bursting occurs decreases in size @xcite .",
    "this would seem to indicate that adaptation induced bursting may not be robust to heterogeneity , however , it is unknown how robust this network level bursting is to heterogeneity in different parameters .",
    "an extension of the mean - field system in @xcite to large networks of heterogeneous neurons , is needed to fully analyze the robustness of adaptation induced bursting .",
    "the application of mean - field analysis to large networks of heterogeneous neurons has been limited to networks of one dimensional integrate and fire neurons with heterogeneity in the applied current@xcite .",
    "hansel and mato @xcite analyze a network of all - to - all coupled quadratic integrate and fire neurons consisting of two subpopulations : one excitatory and one inhibitory .",
    "they showed analytically that the tonic firing asynchronous state can lose stability either to a synchronous tonic firing state or a bursting state .",
    "vladimirski et al .",
    "@xcite analyze a network of all - to - all coupled linear integrate and fire neurons subject to synaptic depression .",
    "this model was used to study network induced bursting in the developing chick spinal cord .",
    "their derivation of the mean - field model is based on temporal averaging of the fast synaptic gating variable , in addition to the usual network averaging .",
    "this results in a model that only involves the distribution of slow synaptic depression variable and the distribution of firing rates .",
    "vladimirski et al .",
    "note that , for their model , increased heterogeneity tends to make population induced bursting more robust .",
    "they also note that one can not understand the behaviour of their network with a single slow , network averaged synaptic depression variable .",
    "the motivation for the present paper is to explore the effect of heterogeneity in parameters on network induced bursting when adaptation is the primary negative feedback acting on the individual firing rates . to this end",
    ", we introduce a set of mean - field equations for networks of heterogeneous two - dimensional integrate and fire neurons .",
    "while the specific neural model we consider is for neurons with adaptation , our derivation is quite general and could be applied to other integrate and fire models .",
    "in contrast with @xcite our derivation of the mean - field model does not use temporal averaging thus we end up with a mean - field system which involves the network averaged synaptic gating variables as well as the distribution of adaptation variables .",
    "we also allow for heterogeneity in more than one parameter .",
    "our approach is a generalization of that used for homogeneous networks of two dimensional integrate and fire neurons @xcite , however , in the heterogeneous case it turns out that there are actually multiple mean - field models , as different assumptions can be made during the derivation .",
    "this leads us to three distinct mean - field systems , each derived under different assumptions , and used for different purposes .",
    "together , these sets of equations allow us to do bifurcation analysis on large networks , as in the homogeneous case .",
    "we show that the bifurcation structure of the heterogeneous network differs both qualitatively and quantitatively from the homogeneous network case .",
    "we discuss the implications of this for network induced bursting in the hippocampus .",
    "when considering a homogeneous network , the mean - field variables are a good approximation for the variables of every neuron .",
    "however , this is not the case for a heterogeneous network .",
    "if the heterogeneity is large , then the neuron variables may be also widely distributed , rendering information about the first moments less useful .",
    "this also implies that the behavior of any individual neuron is less predictable with a mean - field system than it was in the homogeneous case .",
    "one of our mean - field systems addresses this problem , giving information about the distributions of the variables instead of just the mean .    when considering a model for a specific heterogeneous network of neurons , one stumbling block is determining the distribution of parameters .",
    "estimates of the distribution can be made through direct intracellular recording of a sufficient number of neurons , and conventional measurements of the biophysical properties ( membrane capacitance , voltage threshold , etc . ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is a very time consuming and intensive process .",
    "what is needed is a way of measuring the biophysical parameters of multiple neurons simultaneously .",
    "there are a few ways to sample multiple neurons such as multi - unit recordings using tetrode arrays , or two - photon microscopy techniques @xcite .",
    "however , these techniques typically only tell us about spike times of large ( dozens to hundreds of neurons ) networks @xcite . while an impressive accomplishment",
    ", this still does not tell us anything directly about the biophysical properties of the neurons that caused those spikes . in this paper",
    "we use a mean - field system to determine an approximate distribution of firing rates for a network given a known distribution of parameters .",
    "this is an unusual state of affairs for a mean - field system , as these kinds of systems seldom give information about entire distributions .",
    "more importantly however , using a mean - field system , we can invert a distribution of steady state firing rates ( which can be obtained from multi - unit recordings ) to obtain a distribution of parameters .",
    "in fact , this can be done at the individual neuron level , to determine the parameter value for any particular neuron .",
    "this allows one to estimate different biophysical parameters , which are difficult to measure at the network level , using easy to measure firing rate distributions .",
    "however , the assumptions required for the numerical accuracy of the estimation are fairly strong .",
    "the plan for our article is as follows .",
    "section 1.1 introduces the general class of adapting two - dimensional integrate and fire neurons used in our network models .",
    "this class was introduced by touboul @xcite , who also completed the bifurcation analysis of the single , uncoupled neuron .",
    "population density methods are briefly introduced in section 1.2 , as a population density equation serves as an intermediate step to obtain our mean - field models .",
    "section 2 begins with a review of mean - field theory and the equations for the homogeneous network .",
    "this is followed , in sections 2.1 - 2.3 , by the derivation of the three mean - field systems for the heterogeneous network .",
    "a comparison of numerical simulations of these mean - field systems and the full network is the subject of section 2.4",
    ". applications of mean - field theory to networks with a single heterogeneous parameter can be found in section 3 including bifurcation analysis ( section 3.1 ) , distributions of parameters and firing rates ( section 3.2 ) and using mean - field theory for parameter estimation from firing rate data ( section 3.3 ) .",
    "applications of mean - field theory to networks with multiple sources of heterogeneity are included in section 4 .",
    "a discussion of our work and its implications can be found in section 5 .",
    "we consider a network of two - dimensional integrate and fire models of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the nondimensionalized membrane potential , and @xmath2 serves as an adaptation variable .",
    "time has also been non - dimensionalized .",
    "the dynamical equations ( [ de1])-([de2 ] ) are supplemented by the following discontinuities @xmath3 this particular notation was formally introduced by touboul @xcite , along with a full bifurcation analysis of this general family of adapting integrate and fire neurons .",
    "members of this family include the izhikevich model @xcite , the adaptive exponential ( adex ) model @xcite , and touboul s own quartic model @xcite .",
    "the methods of this paper can be applied to a network of any particular neuron belonging to this general family , and thus all derivations are done for this model . for the numerical examples , however , we only consider the izhikevich neuron : @xmath4 in dimensionless form , this is given by - with @xmath5 in addition to dimensionless versions of the discontinuities .",
    "the application to other neural models is straight forward , see @xcite where the homogeneous mean - field theory has been derived and tested for both the adex and the izhikevich models .",
    "networks of these neurons can be coupled together through changes in the synaptic conductance .",
    "the synaptic conductance of post - synaptic neuron @xmath6 due to presynaptic neurons @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the maximal synaptic conductance of neuron @xmath6 and @xmath10 denotes the total proportion of postsynaptic ion channels open in the membrane of neuron @xmath6 .",
    "the time dependent variable @xmath11 represents the proportion of postsynaptic ion channels open in the membrane of neuron @xmath6 as a result of the firing in neuron @xmath12 .    the changes in @xmath11 that occur after a spike are often modeled as transient pulses . for example ,",
    "if neuron @xmath12 fires its @xmath13th action potential at time @xmath14 , then the variable @xmath11 at time @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 there are different functions proposed for @xmath17 in the literature including the simple exponential , the alpha synapse , and the double exponential .",
    "we primarily consider the simple exponential synapse @xmath18 which is governed by the ordinary differential equation @xmath19    in the rest of the paper , we assume all - to - all connectivity and that the synaptic parameters @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the same for every synapse . in this case",
    "we may set @xmath22 for all @xmath6 , as each postsynaptic neuron receives the same summed input from all the presynaptic neurons .",
    "then , using and , the network of all - to - all coupled neurons that we consider is given by the following system of discontinuous ode s : @xmath23 @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "in the examples , we consider one or more parameters as the sources of heterogeneity .",
    "however , to simplify the notation in the derivations , we use the vector @xmath26 to represent all the heterogeneous parameters . then , denoting the state variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 as the vector @xmath27 ,",
    "we can write the equations for the individual oscillator as    @xmath28    given a specific heterogeneous parameter , @xmath29 and @xmath30 may not depend on @xmath26 , or all of the components of @xmath26 .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , we include the dependence in both equations .",
    "our numerical examples are restricted to the izhikevich neural model , and we primarily consider the driving current @xmath31 of each neuron , the synaptic conductance @xmath32 and the adaptation jump size , @xmath33 as the source of heterogeneity .",
    "however , the mean - field equations we derive can be applied to any of the two - dimensional adapting integrate and fire models , with any heterogeneous parameter or set of parameters .",
    "finally , we note that in many applications , @xmath34 is a small parameter , and thus the @xmath35 term can be dropped in @xmath30 .",
    "we do this in all our numerical studies .",
    "however , one can can still derived appropriate mean - field equations if this term is present ( see discussion in @xcite ) , and thus we have left the term in the derivations .",
    "the population density function , @xmath36 determines the density of neurons at a point in phase space , @xmath27 , at time @xmath15 .",
    "consider first the case of a homogeneous network , i.e. , all the oscillators have the same parameter values , denoted by @xmath26 . in the limit as @xmath37 , one can derive the following evolution equation for the population density function : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 and must satisfy the boundary condition @xmath41 in the same limit , the differential equation for @xmath42 converges to @xmath43 where the integral term is actually the network averaged firing rate , which we denote as @xmath44 .",
    "derivations of equation ( [ continuityequation ] ) can be found in various sources @xcite .",
    "equation is frequently referred to as the continuity equation and it has various applications besides its use as an intermediate step in mean - field reductions .",
    "for example , the equation has been used to determine the stability of the asynchronous tonic firing state by various authors @xcite .",
    "these papers predominantly consider homogeneous networks of linear integrate and fire neurons .",
    "the exception is the work of hansel and mato @xcite which considers heterogeneity in the applied current .",
    "one can study stability of various firing states using spectral analysis or other analytical treatments of this equation @xcite .",
    "however , these approaches are too complicated for the models we consider in this paper .    now consider a heterogeneous network where the parameters vary from oscillator to oscillator , but are static in time",
    ". then one can rewrite the equations for the individual oscillator as @xmath45 in this case the flux contribution due to @xmath26 is 0 , and the evolution equation for the network is given by @xmath46 the density now has the vector of parameters , @xmath26 , as an independent variable .",
    "the flux consists of the vector @xmath47 , with @xmath26 as an independent variable , as opposed to a fixed constant .",
    "if the parameters are time varying however , the final component of the flux will be non - zero .",
    "the equation for @xmath42 is also different in the heterogeneous case : @xmath48    while the evolution equation is an exact representation for the network in the large network limit , it is difficult to work with analytically",
    ". additionally , as the dimensions of the pde become large , it becomes difficult to find numerical solutions efficiently @xcite .",
    "however , mean - field reductions of the network can be used to reduce the population density pde to a system of nonlinear switching odes that governs the moments of the distribution .",
    "unlike the pde , the system of odes is tractable using bifurcation theory , at least numerically .",
    "furthermore , we show that in the heterogeneous case , the resulting mean - field systems can yield more information than just the type of bifurcation that the network can undergo .      in the homogeneous case ,",
    "the mean - field system of equations for an all - to - all coupled izhikevich network was derived in @xcite .",
    "we present here a quick summary of this derivation . in order to derive a mean - field system of equations ,",
    "one first needs to reduce the pde for @xmath49 by a dimension .",
    "this is done by first writing the density in its conditional form : @xmath50 and then integrating the continuity equation with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "this yields the one dimensional pde @xmath51 where the flux has been redefined to @xmath52 one can now make a first order moment closure assumption , @xmath53 , and derive an approximate ode for @xmath54 , which yields the system @xmath55 where the subscript on the density function has been dropped for convenience .",
    "the details , and validity of the first order moment closure assumption that is used can be found in @xcite .",
    "we note however that the work in @xcite was primarily with leaky integrate and fire neurons , as opposed to the two - dimensional adapting class we consider here .",
    "however , it is a necessary assumption to proceed analytically .",
    "if we assume that the adaptation time constant , @xmath56 is large , one can apply a quasi - steady state approximation to derive a system of switching ode s for @xmath54 and @xmath42 : @xmath57^{-1 } & : h(\\langle w \\rangle , s)\\geq 0   \\\\       0 & : h(\\langle w \\rangle , s)<0    \\end{array }    \\right.\\label{switch1 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the switching manifold for the system , @xmath58 is given by : @xmath59 note that @xmath58 depends on the parameter(s ) of the model , and thus for the heterogeneous case , we make this dependence explicit by writing @xmath60 .",
    "as the computation for @xmath61 is somewhat lengthy and is only outlined in the discussion of @xcite , we have placed it in appendix a.    for the izhikevich neuron , equations - become @xmath62^{-1 } & : h(\\langle w \\rangle , s)\\geq 0   \\\\        0 & : h(\\langle w \\rangle , s)<0 \\end{array } \\right.\\label{izswitch1 }   \\\\ h(\\langle w \\rangle , s ) & = & i - \\langle w \\rangle -\\frac{(\\alpha+gs)^2}{4 } + ge_rs . \\label{hiz } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in this case , we can evaluate @xmath63 explicitly : @xmath64 in addition to an approximation to @xmath65 @xmath66 a comparison of solutions of these equations and the full network are shown in figure [ fig1 ] for both the tonic firing and the bursting case .",
    "this system of equations is valid when @xmath67 , however the magnitude of @xmath21 is also significant . while in the original derivation of @xcite , @xmath68 was suggested as a criterion for validity , this is not actually necessary .",
    "one merely requires that @xmath21 not be significantly smaller then @xmath69 , the time scale of the pde .",
    "the reason for this is that if the time scale of the ode for @xmath42 is smaller than that of the pde then the quasi - steady state approximation must be applied to the ode for @xmath42 as well .",
    "the requirements on the time constants are carried forward in the heterogeneous case .    in our models ,",
    "the timescale of the ode for @xmath42 is typically between that of the pde and that of the ode for @xmath2 , and we have not applied the quasi - steady approximation to @xmath42 .",
    "applying a quasi - steady state approximation to both @xmath42 and the reduced pde yields a more compact system , which is just an ode for @xmath70 , however the analysis does not get any simpler .",
    "the reason for this is two - fold : the ode for @xmath54 remains non - smooth , and the firing rate now has to be implicitly solved at each time step .",
    "thus , it is more convenient to apply the quasi - steady state approximation only to the partial differential equation .",
    "when parameter heterogeneity is added into the mix , it turns out that there are multiple ",
    "mean - field \" systems of equations that can be derived , by applying different assumptions on the conditional moments .",
    "we outline three different assumptions that can be made , and the resulting system of mean - field equations in each case .",
    "we begin by writing out the density function in the conditional form @xmath71 the continuity equation is then given by @xmath72 simple integration with respect to @xmath26 yields the reduced continuity equation @xmath73 this step is valid for all the non - dimensionalized models we consider as they are all linear in their dimensionless parameters ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the flux has also been redefined upon integration to @xmath74 we now apply the moment closure assumption @xmath75 to yield the following pde : @xmath76 it should be clear that this is equivalent to the continuity equation for a homogeneous network with parameter values fixed at @xmath77 .",
    "thus , the associated mean - field system is identical to the homogeneous case , only with the parameters fixed at @xmath78 .",
    "this is the simplest assumption one can make in the heterogeneous case .",
    "for example , if we treat @xmath79 as the source of heterogeneity for a network of izhikevich neurons , with distribution @xmath80 , then the resulting mean - field system is @xmath81 note that @xmath79 in equations - has been replaced by @xmath82 in equations ( [ switch12])-([vm1 ] ) .",
    "we treat this system as the baseline mean - field model for comparison purposes , in addition to direct numerical simulations of the network , and we denote this system of equations as mean - field one ( mfi )",
    ". we should expect this system to be an adequate approximation to the actual network for narrowly centered distributions of the parameter heterogeneity ( small values of the variance , @xmath83 ) .",
    "this set of differential equations is representative of a common approach taken when fitting actual neurons . in this approach , multiple estimates of parameters or measurements taken from multiple neurons",
    "are averaged to yield a single parameter value , which is really the mean parameter value , @xmath84 .",
    "simulations of homogeneous , large networks are then run with the parameters fixed at their mean values . as we shall see in subsequent sections ,",
    "the behavior of a simulated heterogeneous network can differ substantially from that of mfi .",
    "to derived our second mean - field system , we begin by writing the density function in the alternative conditional form @xmath85 next we integrate the continuity equation with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "this yields the following system @xmath86 where the last term vanishes as @xmath87 is assumed to be vanishing on the boundary , and @xmath88    we now make the first order moment closure assumption @xmath89 . then to complete the system",
    ", we must derive a differential equation for @xmath54 : @xmath90 note that we have made the approximation @xmath91 in addition to dropping the @xmath92 terms .",
    "additionally , the substitution on line comes from the boundary condition .    applying a quasi - steady state approximation to the pde yields the following equation for the steady state voltage independent flux , @xmath93 : @xmath94^{-1}\\rho_\\beta(\\bm\\beta ) & \\text{if } \\quad h(\\langle w \\rangle , s,\\bm\\beta)\\geq 0\\\\ 0 & \\text{if}\\quad   h(\\langle w \\rangle , s,\\bm\\beta)<0 \\end{cases}. \\label{jbeta}\\ ] ] we interpret the ratio @xmath95 as the parameter dependent ( or conditional ) network averaged firing rate , @xmath96 , based on the fact that @xmath97 in other words , the distribution of parameters induces a distribution of firing rates across the network , and the network averaged firing rate is the mean of the distribution .    in summary ,",

    "more importantly however , we have surpassed the natural limitation of mean - field systems : that they can only provide information about the first moments . with a few additional tools , we used mfiii to derive information about distributions of firing rates , and even parameters , given some basic knowledge .",
    "other researchers @xcite have derived firing rate distributions for heterogeneous networks , however these have been derived under differing assumptions .",
    "for example , the heterogeneous mean field systems studied by hansel and mato ( equations ( 5.5)-(5.7 ) in @xcite ) have similar integral terms to our mfii however they are firing rate models .",
    "our models are current / conductance based models .",
    "the difference between these two types of equations arises from which time scale is the fastest , that of the synaptic current , or the firing rate .",
    "if the firing rate time scale is assumed to be the fastest , then a differential equation for the synaptic current can be obtained ( as in our case ) .",
    "if the time scale of the synaptic current is assumed to be the fastest , then one obtains firing rate equations , as in @xcite .",
    "the fact that these two different limits result in different kinds of equations were first highlighted in @xcite ( section 7.2 ) .",
    "additionally , no adaptation is contained in the rate models in @xcite . finally , it is likely that the firing rate models shown in @xcite can not display period doubling bifurcations as they have a similar structure to mfii , which misses out on the more complicated bifurcations of the actual network that mfiii can reproduce , due to its pde nature .",
    "the model of vladimirski et al .",
    "@xcite is formulated in terms of an input - output relation for the synaptic conductance , so has a different structure than ours .",
    "it involves a distribution of the synaptic depression variable so has some aspects similar to our mfiii , however , no pde governing the evolution of this variable is derived .",
    "dur - e - ahmad et al .",
    "@xcite studied adaptation induced bursting in a network of homogeneous izhikevich neurons , with parameters determined from experimental data on ca3 pyramidal neurons .",
    "they showed that , if the adaptation is strong enough , network bursting occurs in large regions of the parameter space consisting of the synaptic conductance , @xmath116 , and the applied current , @xmath113 .",
    "in @xcite we showed that the transition from tonic firing to bursting involves a saddle - node bifurcation of non - smooth limit cycles , followed by a grazing bifurcation and a subcritical hopf bifurcation .",
    "for fixed @xmath113 greater than rheobase but sufficiently small , there is one transition from tonic firing to bursting at a low @xmath116 value and another from bursting back to tonic firing at a higher @xmath116 value .",
    "thus the bursting region is a closed semi - circular region in the @xmath116 , @xmath113 parameter space . in @xcite",
    "we showed that the size of this bursting region is reduced if the network is split into two homogeneous subnetworks , one strongly adapting and one weakly adapting . here",
    ", we used the tools we developed to investigate how this adaptation induced network bursting is affected by heterogeneity in the parameters .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we have found that adaptation induced network bursting is not very robust to heterogeneity .",
    "this has been confirmed by direct simulations of the full network , bifurcation analysis using mfii and analysis of the proportion of bursting neurons in the network using mfiii .",
    "this lack of robustness is caused by two changes to the homogeneous case :    1 .",
    "the low @xmath116 hopf bifurcation point moves towards higher values , thereby decreasing the size of the bursting region 2 .",
    "the low @xmath116 hopf bifurcation switches from subcritical to supercritical .",
    "this has two effects : * the bifurcation direction changes , eliminating the bursting at conductance values less than the bifurcation value * the initial limit cycles created by the bifurcation are small amplitude oscillations in the firing rate as opposed to full bursts , thus the transition to bursting moves to even higher conductance values .",
    "further , in networks with both weakly and strongly adapting neurons , heterogeneity caused the high @xmath116 hopf bifurcation value to decrease when the proportion of strongly adapting neurons is reduced .",
    "let us now put our results in the context of experimental results on the ca3 region .",
    "bursting is often seen in these studies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.3.5 ) . when the neurons have their synaptic inputs blocked however , the majority ( @xmath117% ) of these pyramidal neurons do not display bursting , but different degrees of spike frequency adaptation @xcite .",
    "thus , it would seem that adaptation induced network bursting should play a role in the ca3 network .",
    "however , the biophysically important part of the parameter region is in the low @xmath116 region @xcite . when this fact is taken in conjunction with our results described above",
    ", this would seem to weaken the case that adaptation induced network bursting is the only source of bursting in ca3 networks .",
    "some other mechanism seems necessary .    in their study of hippocampal ca3 pyramidal neurons , hemond and colleagues",
    "note that roughly 20% of pyramidal neurons were intrinsically bursting .",
    "that is , the neurons burst without any synaptic input for some input current .",
    "it may by possible that a small subpopulation of intrinsically bursting neurons can facilitate bursting in the rest of the network , however this would depend on the conductance values connecting this particular subpopulation to the rest of the network .",
    "this hypothesis can be tested relatively easily using a mean - field approach .",
    "all that is required is to fit a two - dimensional adapting model to the intrinsically bursting neurons .",
    "this is feasible , as has been previously noted , all the two - dimensional adapting neurons can be turned into intrinsically bursting neurons by simple parameter changes @xcite .",
    "the conductance parameter connecting this subpopulation to the rest is best treated as a bifurcation parameter , with some estimate of the range in which it lies in from physiological data .    while an intrinsically bursting subpopulation is the most promising avenue of study with regards to hippocampal bursting , synaptic depression",
    "has also been shown to induce bursting in oscillators that can not otherwise display this behavior . in a model of the developing chick spinal cord",
    ", @xcite found that heterogeneity actually makes the bursting more robust , as opposed to less as we have found .",
    "thus it is possible the synaptic depression induced bursting is more robust to heterogeneity than adaptation induced bursting .",
    "however , in this study the heterogeneity was via a uniform distribution in the applied current ( as opposed to the gaussian distributions we consider ) and typically @xmath118 was close to rheobase , which could also be factors in their results .",
    "in addition to area ca3 in the hippocampus , adaptation induced bursting has also been suggested as a possible mechanism for the generation of velocity controlled oscillators ( vco s ) in the entorhinal cortex by @xcite .",
    "the vco s burst at frequencies that vary with the velocity of the animal . when a subset of vco s signals are linearly added to a readout neuron , an interference pattern emerges and a grid cell is formed .",
    "@xcite use a recursively coupled network of homogeneous izhikevich neurons with adaptation variables given by @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , and these parameters are strong enough so that adaptation induced bursting can occur .",
    "the network acts a single velocity controlled oscillator , and the burst frequency is set to vary with the velocity of an animal .",
    "this is done by fixing the @xmath116 parameter at a specific value , and inverting the @xmath121 curve where @xmath122 is the frequency of bursts , and @xmath79 is the homogenous applied current to each neuron .",
    "grid cells can be generated by using multiple networks and linearly adding their output currents to a read - out neuron .",
    "this was done under uncorrelated noisy inputs arriving to each neuron . however , @xcite state that synchrony in the noise ( which can come from the animals velocity signal for example ) coming to each vco network can disrupt grid - cell formation . here , we have shown that a heterogeneous network of oscillators can still maintain a network level oscillation rate , even if the individual neurons have different behaviors .",
    "the network level behaviors are predicted from the mean - field systems .",
    "given the fact that the individual neurons are heterogeneous , any synchronized noise input into the individual neurons should become increasingly desynchronzied by the differing resposnes of the individual neurons . as a network level oscillation exists and the heterogeneity will likely desynchronize any noise coming to the individual oscillators ,",
    "this is a plausible means of generating velocity controlled oscillators .",
    "we leave this particular application of mean - field theory for future work .    in either of these applications ,",
    "a mean - field system may yield valuable insights as to the mechanisms of bursting and the parameter regions they occur in . by carefully choosing the appropriate bifurcation parameters , and accounting for the level of heterogeneity in the neurons in the network , one can determine the bifurcation types and behaviors neurons in these different networks display , in addition to estimates of the different distributions to yield insights about the real cells .",
    "when the quasi - steady state approximation is applicable , a very convenient method emerges for computing the moments of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , the quasi - steady state approximation not only yields the steady state flux , but it also yields the steady state density : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the steady state flux ( @xmath63 for @xmath127 ) . obviously with the density , we can compute the moments of any arbitrary function of @xmath1 .",
    "for example , @xmath61 is given by @xmath128 however , once we cross the switching manifold , equation ( [ mevo1 ] ) is no longer valid .",
    "an approximation has to be made to compute @xmath123 in this region .",
    "in particular , we will assume that @xmath129 , and that the dynamics of @xmath123 are fast relative to @xmath42 and @xmath54 .",
    "if so , then the dynamics of @xmath61 are approximately given by @xmath130 and we can solve the steady state equation for @xmath61 @xmath131 however , we have to be careful here .",
    "based on the assumptions on @xmath132 we know that there are only two solutions to this system , and we need to solve for the stable one . for the izhikevich neuron for example ,",
    "this is given by @xmath133 computation of the integral [ mev1 ] for the izhikevich neuron , in conjunction with equation [ mev2 ] yields the following equation for @xmath61 over the entire @xmath134 plane : @xmath135 the same formulas can actually be used for @xmath136 , with the interpretation that they are now explicit functions of @xmath26 in particular , one can show that under tonic firing , @xmath137 is given by the same formula as @xmath61 when @xmath138 . additionally , the formula for @xmath61 for @xmath139 is also a satisfactory approximation for @xmath101 .",
    "to once again reiterate that while the formula for the mean @xmath101 under heterogeneity is the same as the formula for @xmath123 under homogeneity , this does not imply that @xmath140 .",
    "in fact , to compute @xmath123 , one has to compute the traditional integral for it : @xmath141",
    "performing direct simulations of a network is fairly straight forward , but it is somewhat difficult to use the results of the simulations to automatically classify a given neuron , let alone the entire network , as bursting or tonically firing .",
    "we considered various classifiers and opted to use the ratio of the largest to the smallest interspike interval for a neuron when the network has reached steady state . for a bursting neuron ,",
    "the ratio of its largest interspike interval ( which is the interburst interval ) to its smallest interspike interval should be large .",
    "thus for the @xmath142 neuron we define @xmath143 where the max / min is determined after a suitable time period of steady state behaviour ( either bursting or tonically firing ) .",
    "we set a critical ratio , @xmath144 , and classify neuron @xmath6 as bursting if @xmath145 is higher than this ratio",
    ". the critical ratio is typically taken to be 2 .",
    "this is the single neuron classifier .",
    "we use the single neuron classifier to make an estimate for the total proportion of bursting neurons in the network as follows @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the heaviside function .",
    "we can use @xmath148 to classify a network by picking some specific critical value of @xmath148 as a threshold for a classifier , however it is more informative to simply plot the contours of @xmath148 for a set of simulations run over a mesh in the bifurcation parameters of interest .",
    "in @xcite we considered multiple subpopulations for heterogeneous networks by simulating discrete homogeneous subpopulations within a network .",
    "for example , we simulated two subpopulations with two different sets of parameters corresponding to weakly adapting and strongly adapting neurons as a first attempt at studying inhomogeneous networks .",
    "however , a more realistic way of analyzing subpopulations in heterogeneous networks , is through the use of mixed distributions .",
    "a mixed random variable @xmath149 is a function of two or more random variables .",
    "for example , if @xmath150 and @xmath151 are random variables with probability density functions @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively , then @xmath154 is a mixed random variable with probability density function @xmath155    now consider a network where the adaptation jump size @xmath33 comes from two different subpopulations . in one subpopulation",
    ", @xmath156 is large , and in the other , @xmath156 is small .",
    "we can simulate these two subpopulations within an individual ( all - to - all ) coupled network using heterogeneity , and the density function @xmath157 where @xmath158 denotes the proportion of strongly adapting neurons and @xmath159 denotes the strongly adapting subpopulation , and @xmath160 denotes the weakly adapting subpopulation .",
    "note that these densities have higher moments than simply @xmath156 , and it is the magnitude of these moments that determine whether or not the density in the heterogeneous parameter we are considering is bimodal , indicative of multiple subpopulations . using this approach we can analyze how the bimodality affects the steady state distribution properties .",
    "we can also use more of the data gained from real networks for the purposes of simulation , as opposed to arbitrarily classifying neurons as strongly adapting or weakly adapting .",
    "the parameters of the individual density functions can be approximated , along with @xmath161 , using standard statistical approaches ( maximum likelihood estimation , for example ) .",
    "more importantly however , the same mean - field equations apply to a unimodal or a multimodal distribution of heterogeneity .",
    "the procedure in section  [ mf3sec ] requires not only the estimation of @xmath162 , but also the calculation of its inverse and the derivative of this inverse . to calculate @xmath162 the mean field equations - are discretized in @xmath163 and the resulting equations are numerically integrated to steady state , which yields the steady state value of @xmath164 at each mesh point , @xmath165 .",
    "the inverse @xmath166 is calculated via numerically inverting the steady state @xmath167 as a function of @xmath165 as follows .",
    "the matlab function interp1 is used to interpolate values of @xmath163 given values of @xmath168 using the steady state @xmath169 mesh points .",
    "the derivative of the inverse is calculated using a finite - difference approximation over the mesh : @xmath170 this is then used to find @xmath171 at each mesh point via equation .    to implement the computations in section  [ invsec ] ,",
    "equations - are discretized in @xmath163 and numerically integrating to compute the steady state value of @xmath162 at each mesh point , @xmath172 .",
    "this is then used to compute @xmath173 through a first order finite - difference approximation over the discrete mesh : @xmath174 these two quantities are then used as approximations of @xmath175 and @xmath176 in equation to find @xmath177 at each mesh point .    to estimate the parameter values for individual neurons , we take the discretized steady state firing rate , @xmath178 , calculated as indicated above .",
    "we then invert the functional relationship between @xmath178 and @xmath165 , and interpolate the @xmath163 values of the individual neurons using their firing rate , i.e. , we treat @xmath179 and @xmath165 as the @xmath180 points to be interpolated .",
    "this yields an estimate of the parameter values for each individual neuron , unlike in the approach for section  [ mf3sec ] which yielded an estimate of the overall distribution .",
    "note that all that is required for this computation is knowledge of the steady state firing rate for each neuron .",
