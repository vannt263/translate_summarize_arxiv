    "the near horizon geometries of certain extremal black holes contain the ads@xmath0 or ads@xmath1 structures , which are known to play important role in understanding the macroscopic and microscopic entropies of black holes long ago .",
    "the well known examples include the bertotti - robinson solution ( ads@xmath0 ) for extremal reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole in einstein - maxwell theory  @xcite , and the near horizon geometry ( ads@xmath1 ) of the d1-d5 system in string theory  @xcite .",
    "based on the holographic principle  @xcite and its realization in the asymptotically ads spacetime , one can relate the quantum gravity description of black holes with their dual cft in terms of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite . in the past three years , new advances have been made in studying the cft descriptions of a class of extremal black holes in which the near horizon geometries are of the warped ads@xmath1 structure ( with @xmath2 isometry ) .",
    "the initial progress was the calculation of the left hand central charge and temperature of the 2d cft dual to the extremal kerr black hole , called the kerr / cft correspondence  @xcite .",
    "the kerr / cft duality was further generalized into the near extremal and nonextremal cases by comparing the scattering amplitudes of external probe fields from the gravity side with those of the corresponding operators in the dual 2d cft side  @xcite . especially , even though the nonextremal kerr black hole does nt contain the warped ads@xmath1 geometry , a 2d hidden conformal symmetry can be detected by a probe scalar field at low frequencies .",
    "other nonextremal black holes are shown to have the similar property , see",
    "@xcite . there are various related studies and generalizations  @xcite , see a recent review  @xcite for more references therein .",
    "a nontrivial generalization of the kerr / cft correspondence is the studying of the cft descriptions for nonrotating charged black holes , the simplest example is the ( near ) extremal 4d rn black hole , which only contains a near horizon ads@xmath0 geometry , but accompanied by an @xmath3 gauge field .",
    "the key observation was that the background @xmath3 gauge field plays an equivalent role as that of the rotation in rotating black holes , consequently a warped ads@xmath1 structure is formed together with the ads@xmath0 base manifold .",
    "this fact enables us to investigate the ( near ) extremal rn / cft duality  @xcite , and the 2d cft description for nonextremal rn black hole  @xcite .",
    "combined with the results in the kerr / cft and rn / cft correspondences , it is expectable that a multiple dual 2d cft descriptions should exist for charged rotating black holes , e.g. , the kerr - newman ( kn ) black hole .",
    "we showed that , besides the angular momentum @xmath4-picture ( associated with the kerr / cft duality , where the central charges of the dual 2d cft are @xmath5 ) revealed in  @xcite , another @xmath6-picture ( associated with the rn / cft duality , in which the central charges are @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the parameter depends on the embedding ) does exist for the general nonextremal kn black hole by probing the 2d hidden conformal symmetries via an external charged scalar field  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , a kn / cfts correspondence was suggested .",
    "this suggestion was checked by matching of the absorption cross sections and real time correlators calculated in both the @xmath4- and the @xmath6-pictures from the gravity and the cft sides .",
    "it is natural to believe that these two individual descriptions are just special limits of a unknown full holographic dual description of the kn black hole . the kn / cfts duality could be much more easily understood in the geometric picture since in the near extremal limit , the near horizon kn black hole contains an ads@xmath0 geometry together with two @xmath3 fibers , with @xmath9 isometry .",
    "thus there are two possible choices to form the desired warped ads@xmath1 structures , and certainly to have two individual dual 2d cft descriptions .",
    "a similar idea has been studied later for the spinning m5 branes in  @xcite . moreover",
    ", our work also suggested a fascinating `` microscopic hair conjecture ''  for each macroscopic hair parameter , in additional to the mass of a black hole in the einstein - maxwell theory ( with dimension @xmath10 ) , there should exist an associated holographic cft@xmath0 description .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "we first review some basic properties of the kn black hole and study the scattering of a probe charged scalar field in section ii . in sections",
    "iii and iv , we explicitly analyze the @xmath4-picture and the @xmath6-picture of the kn black hole , respectively , including the probing of hidden conformal symmetry , the calculation of absorption cross sections and real time correlators .",
    "then we give the conclusion and discussion in section v.",

    "when @xmath29 , the radial equation can be further expressed in a symmetric form @xmath30 ^ 2}{(r - r_+ ) ( r_+ - r_- ) } - \\frac{\\left [ ( r_-^2 + a^2 ) \\omega - a m - q r_- q \\right]^2}{(r - r_- ) ( r_+ - r_- ) } \\right ] r \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad + \\left [ \\omega^2 r^2 + 2 ( \\omega m - q q ) \\omega r +   \\omega^2 a^2 - \\omega^2 q^2 + ( 2 \\omega m - q q)^2 \\right ] r = \\lambda r.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under conditions : ( 1 ) small frequency @xmath31 ( consequently @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) , ( 2 ) small probe charge @xmath34 and ( 3 ) near region @xmath35 , the potential terms in the second line can be neglected , and @xmath36",

    "we just list the main results , for detailed calculation , please refer to  @xcite .",
    "to probe the @xmath4-picture cft@xmath0 description dual to the kn black hole , one should consider a neutral scalar field by imposing @xmath38 , then eq.([eqr ] ) becomes @xmath39 ^ 2}{(r - r_+ ) ( r_+ - r_- ) } + \\frac{\\left [ ( r_-^2 + a^2 ) \\partial_t + a \\partial_\\phi \\right]^2}{(r - r_- ) ( r_+ - r_- ) } \\right ) \\phi = l ( l + 1 ) \\phi.\\ ] ] it was shown that the left hand side of the above equation is just the @xmath40 casimir operator acting on @xmath22 with the identifications of parameters  @xcite @xmath41 since the neutral probe scalar field does not couple with the background gauge field , it only reveals the angular momentum dominated section of the dual field theory , resembling the 2d cft dual to the kerr black hole with central charges @xmath42 one can directly check that the cft microscopic entropy from the cardy formula indeed reproduces the bekenstein - hawking area entropy of the kn black hole : @xmath43      the near region solutions of eq.([eqr ] ) include ingoing and outgoing modes as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is imposed , @xmath46 , the expressions of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are @xmath51    the asymptotic form of the ingoing mode is @xmath52 where @xmath53 and the conformal weights of the operator dual to the scalar field are @xmath54 hence , @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be expressed in terms of @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath57 with @xmath58 the essential part of the absorption cross section can be estimated as @xmath59 further with the help of the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath60 the absorption cross section can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath61 which is the finite temperature absorption cross section of an operator dual to the neutral probe scalar field in the @xmath4-picture 2d cft dual to the kn black hole .",
    "the two - point retarded correlator calculated from the gravity side is  @xcite @xmath62    from the cft side , the retarded green function @xmath63 can be obtained from the euclidean correlator ( in terms of the euclidean frequencies @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ) @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) by the analytic continuation from the on the upper half complex @xmath69-plane @xmath70 and the euclidean frequencies @xmath71 and @xmath72 should take discrete values of the matsubara frequencies ( @xmath73 are integers for bosons and half integers for fermions ) @xmath74 at these frequencies , the retarded green function precisely agrees with the gravity side computation eq.([greenrj ] ) up to a numerical normalization factor .",
    "to probe the @xmath6-picture cft@xmath0 description one should impose @xmath75 , and the the corresponding radial equation , from eq.([eqr ] ) , becomes @xmath76 ^ 2}{(r - r_+ ) ( r_+ - r_- ) } + \\frac{\\left [ ( r_-^2 + a^2 ) \\partial_t + \\frac{q r_-}{\\ell } \\partial_\\chi \\right]^2}{(r - r_- ) ( r_+ - r_- ) } \\right ) \\phi = l(l+1 ) \\phi,\\ ] ] where @xmath77 acts on `` internal space '' of the @xmath3 symmetry such that @xmath78 , and @xmath8 is a parameter depending on the embedding , see  @xcite for detailed explanation .",
    "similarly , the radial equation is just the casimir operator of the @xmath40 lie algebra  @xcite acting on @xmath22 with the identifications @xmath79 now since the momentum mode on the @xmath80 direction is turned off , such probe scalar field is not able to explore the information of the background rotation .",
    "therefore , it can reveal only the charge dominated subsection resembling the 2d cft dual to the rn black hole with @xmath81 and the cft microscopic entropy matches the bekenstein - hawking area entropy of the kn black hole @xmath82      the solutions of the near region kg eq.([eqr ] ) , with @xmath83 , are @xmath84 where the expressions of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are @xmath89 , \\quad c_q = 1 - i 2 \\gamma_q.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the asymptotic solution of the ingoing mode is @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 the coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 can be expressed as @xmath93 where @xmath94 with @xmath95 the absorption cross section can be estimated by @xmath96 again , with the help of the first law of thermodynamics @xmath97 , the absorption cross section can be expressed as @xmath98 which matches the finite temperature absorption cross section of an operator with the conformal weights ( @xmath99 ) , frequencies ( @xmath100 ) electric charges ( @xmath101 ) and chemical potentials ( @xmath102 ) in the dual 2d cft with the temperatures ( @xmath103 ) .      in the @xmath6-picture ,",
    "the two - point retarded correlator is @xmath104 at the matsubara frequencies  ( [ matsubara ] ) , the retarded green function agrees well with the cft results  ( [ cftgr]-[cftger ] ) up to a normalization factor depending on @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "in this short article , we briefly reviewed our recent work on the twofold dual 2d cft descriptions of the generic nonextremal kn black hole by probing the hidden conformal symmetries , in terms of the kerr / cft and rn / cft correspondences .",
    "the kn / cfts dualities are shown to be supported by the matching of the entropies , absorption cross sections and real time correlators computed from both the gravity and the cft sides .",
    "a geometric way to understand this multiple dual cft pictures is that , the kn black hole contains two @xmath3 fibers , one is the rotation another is the electromagnetic field .",
    "its near extremal near horizon geometry has the isometry @xmath107 , thus there are two options to form the desired warped ads@xmath1 structures , consequently , leading two dual 2d cft dualities .",
    "therefore , besides the mass , each one of the other two macroscopic hairs of the kn black hole , can provide an individual holographically dual cft@xmath0 description .",
    "this multiple dual cft descriptions has been discussed for the higher dimensional rotating black holes with multiple rotations , in which each angular momentum can provide an individual dual cft@xmath0 , see for example  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to check our microscopic hair conjecture for more general black holes with multiple @xmath3 charges , and find a full dual field theory description in which each cft corresponds to some certain limit .",
