    "the interaction between deterministic and stochastic effects in population dynamics has played , and continues to play , an important role in the modeling of infectious diseases .",
    "the mechanistic modeling side of population dynamics is well - known and established  @xcite .",
    "these models typically are assumed to be useful for infinitely large , homogeneous populations , and arise from the mean field analysis of probabilistic models . on the other hand ,",
    "when one considers finite populations , random interactions give rise to internal noise effects , which may introduce new dynamics .",
    "stochastic effects are quite prominent in finite populations , which can range from ecological dynamics  @xcite to childhood epidemics in cities  @xcite . for homogeneous populations with seasonal forcing , noise also comes into play in the prediction of large outbreaks  @xcite .",
    "specifically , external random perturbations change the probabilistic prediction of epidemic outbreaks as well as its control  @xcite .    when geometric structure is applied to the population ,",
    "the interactions are modeled as a network  @xcite .",
    "many types of static networks which support epidemics have been considered .",
    "some examples include small world networks  @xcite , hierarchical networks  @xcite , and transportation networks of patch models  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the fluctuation of epidemics on adaptive networks , where the wiring between nodes changes in response to the node information , has been examined  @xcite . in adaptive network models , even the mean field can be high - dimensional , since nodes and links evolve in time and must be approximated as an additional set of ordinary differential equations .",
    "another aspect of epidemic models which is often of interest involves the inclusion of a time delay .",
    "the delay term makes the analysis significantly more complicated .",
    "however , it is possible to approximate the delay by creating a cascade consisting of a large number of compartments  @xcite .",
    "for example , one could simulate the delay associated with a disease exposure time with several hundred `` exposed '' compartments .",
    "these model examples are just a few of the types of very high - dimensional models that are currently of interest . as a result of the high - dimensionality ,",
    "there is much computation involved , and the analysis is quite difficult . in particular , real - time computation is not currently possible .",
    "however , there are usually many time scales that are well - separated ( due typically to a large range in order of magnitude of the parameters ) when considering such high - dimensional problems . in the presence of well - separated time scales ,",
    "a model reduction method is needed to examine the dynamics on a lower - dimensional space .",
    "it is known that deterministic model reduction methods may not work well in the stochastic realm , which includes epidemic models  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to examine a method of nonlinear , stochastic projection so that the deterministic and stochastic dynamics interact correctly on the lower - dimensional manifold and predict correctly the dynamics when compared to the full system .",
    "because the noise affects the timing of outbreaks , it is essential to produce a low - dimensional system which captures the correct timing of the outbreaks as well as the amplitude and phase of any recurrent behavior .",
    "we will demonstrate that our stochastic model reduction method properly captures the initial disease outbreak and continues to accurately predict the outbreaks for time scales which are orders of magnitude longer than the typical relaxation time .",
    "furthermore , in practice , real disease data includes only the number of infectious individuals .",
    "our method allows us to predict the number of unobserved exposed individuals based on the observed number of infectious individuals .    for stochastic model reduction ,",
    "there exist several potential methods for general problems . for a system with certain spectral requirements ,",
    "the existence of a stochastic center manifold was proven in ref .",
    ". non - rigorous stochastic normal form analysis ( which leads to the stochastic center manifold ) was performed in refs .  .",
    "rigorous theoretical analysis of normal form coordinate transformations for stochastic center manifold reduction was developed in refs .  .",
    "later , another method of stochastic normal form reduction was developed  @xcite , in which any anticipatory convolutions ( integrals into the future of the noise processes ) that appeared in the slow modes were removed .",
    "since this latter analysis makes the construction of the stochastic normal form coordinate transform more transparent , we use this method to derive the reduced stochastic center manifold equation .",
    "figure  [ fig : noise_cartoon ] shows a schematic demonstrating our approach to the problem .",
    "we consider a high - dimensional system along with its corresponding reduced low - dimensional system . in this article ,",
    "two types of low - dimensional system are discussed : a reduced system based on deterministic center manifold analysis and a reduced system based on a stochastic normal form coordinate transform .",
    "regardless of the type of low - dimensional system being considered , a common noise is injected into both the high - dimensional and low - dimensional models , and an analysis of the solutions found using the high and low - dimensional systems is performed .",
    "schematic demonstrating the injection of a common noise into both the high - dimensional system and its associated low - dimensional system.,width=321,height=160 ]    in this article , as a first study of a high - dimensional system , we consider the susceptible - exposed - infected - recovered ( seir ) epidemiological model with stochastic forcing . as previously mentioned , we could easily consider a seir - type model where the exposed class was modeled using hundreds of compartments .",
    "since the analysis is similar , we consider the simpler standard seir model to demonstrate the power of our method . section  [ sec : seir - model ] provides a complete description of this model .",
    "section  [ sec : dcma ] describes how to transform the deterministic seir system to a new system that satisfies the spectral requirements needed to apply the center manifold theory .",
    "after the theory is used to find the evolution equations that describe the dynamics on the center manifold , we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : incorrect_proj ] how the reduced model that is found using the deterministic result incorrectly projects the noise onto the center manifold .",

    "are contained respectively in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "we begin by describing the stochastic version of the seir model found in ref .  .",
    "we assume that a given population may be divided into the following four classes which evolve in time :    1 .",
    "susceptible class , @xmath0 , consists of those individuals who may contract the disease .",
    "2 .   exposed class , @xmath1 , consists of those individuals who have been infected by the disease but are not yet infectious .",
    "3 .   infectious class , @xmath2 , consists of those individuals who are capable of transmitting the disease to susceptible individuals . 4 .   recovered class , @xmath3 , consists of those individuals who are immune to the disease .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the total population size , denoted as @xmath4 , is constant and can be normalized to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the population class variables @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 represent fractions of the total population .",
    "the governing equations for the stochastic seir model are    & ( t)=-i(t)s(t ) -s(t ) + _ 1_1(t),[e : sdot ] + & ( t)=i(t)s(t ) -(+)e(t)+_2_2(t),[e : edot ] + & ( t)=e(t ) -(+)i(t)+_3_3(t),[e : idot ] + & ( t)=i(t ) -r(t)+_4_4(t),[e : rdot ]    where @xmath14 is the standard deviation of the noise intensity @xmath15 .",
    "each of the noise terms , @xmath16 , describes a stochastic , gaussian white force that is characterized by the correlation functions    & _ i(t)=0,[e : mean ] + & _ i(t)_j(t^)=(t - t^)_ij.[e : corr ]    additionally , @xmath17 represents a constant birth and death rate , @xmath18 is the contact rate , @xmath19 is the rate of infection , so that @xmath20 is the mean latency period , and @xmath21 is the rate of recovery , so that @xmath22 is the mean infectious period .",
    "although the contact rate @xmath18 could be given by a time - dependent function ( e.g. due to seasonal fluctuations ) , for simplicity , we assume @xmath18 to be constant . throughout this article , we use the following parameter values : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "disease parameters correspond to typical measles values  @xcite .",
    "note that any other biologically meaningful parameters may be used as long as the basic reproductive rate @xmath27 > 1 $ ] .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath28 is the number of secondary cases produced by a single infectious individual in a population of susceptibles in one infectious period .    as a first approximation of stochastic effects ,",
    "we have considered additive noise .",
    "this type of noise may result from migration into and away from the population being considered  @xcite .",
    "since it is difficult to estimate fluctuating migration rates  @xcite , it is appropriate to treat migration as an arbitrary external noise source .",
    "also , fluctuations in the birth rate manifest itself as additive noise .",
    "furthermore , as we are not interested in extinction events in this article , it is not necessary to use multiplicative noise . in general , for the problem considered here , it is possible that a rare event in the tail of the noise distribution may cause one or more of the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 components of the solution to become negative . in this article",
    ", we will always assume that the noise is sufficiently small so that a solution remains positive for a long enough time to gather sufficient statistics . even though it is difficult to accurately estimate the appropriate noise level from real data , our choices of noise intensity lie within the huge confidence intervals computed in ref .  .",
    "the case for multiplicative noise will be considered in a separate paper .",
    "although @xmath29 in the deterministic system , one should note that the dynamics of the stochastic seir system will not necessarily have all of the components sum to unity .",
    "however , since the noise has zero mean , the total population will remain close to unity on average .",
    "therefore , we assume that the dynamics are sufficiently described by eqs .",

    "one way to reduce the dimension of a system of equations is through the use of deterministic center manifold theory . in general , a nonlinear vector field can be transformed so that the linear part ( jacobian ) of the vector field has block diagonal form where the first matrix block has eigenvalues with positive real part , the second matrix block has eigenvalues with negative real part , and the third matrix block has eigenvalues with zero real part  @xcite .",
    "these blocks are associated respectively with the unstable eigenspace , the stable eigenspace , and the center eigenspace .",

[ fig : simulationsei](b ) and  [ fig : simulationwsei](b ) have a relative entropy of @xmath159 , which means they are not in agreement . because the simulation of the stochastic dynamics in the complete system of transformed variables do not qualitatively ( or quantitatively ) resemble the original stochastic system",
    ", we can not expect that the reduced system will agree with either the original or the transformed systems .",
    "therefore , much care should be exercised when extending the model reduction results ( which show outstanding agreement ) derived for a specific type of noise in the limit of infinite population to finite populations with a more general type of noise .",
    "we have considered the dynamics of an seir epidemiological model with stochastic forcing in the form of additive , gaussian noise . we have presented two methods of model reduction , whereby the goal is to project both the noise and the dynamics onto the stochastic center manifold .",
    "the first method uses the deterministic center manifold found by neglecting the stochastic terms in the governing equations , while the second method uses a stochastic normal form coordinate transform .",
    "since the original system of governing equations does not have the necessary spectral structure to employ either deterministic or stochastic center manifold theory , the system of equations has been transformed using an appropriate linear transformation coupled with appropriate parameter scaling . at this stage , the first method of model reduction can be performed by computing the deterministic center manifold equation .",
    "substitution of this equation into the complete , stochastic system of transformed equations leads to a reduced system of stochastic evolution equations .",
    "the solutions of the complete , stochastic system of transformed equations as well as the reduced system of equations were computed numerically .",
    "we have shown that the individual time series do not agree , because the noise has not been correctly projected onto the stochastic center manifold . however , by comparing histograms of the probability density , @xmath100 of the @xmath10 and @xmath12 values , we saw that there was very good agreement .",
    "this is caused by the fact that although the two solutions are out of phase with one another , their range of amplitude values are similar .",
    "the phase difference is not represented in the two histograms .",
    "this is a real drawback when trying to predict the timing of outbreaks , and leads to potential problems when considering epidemic control , such as the enhancement of disease extinction through random vaccine control  @xcite .    to accurately project the noise onto the manifold",

    "the numerical solution to this reduced system was compared with the solution to the original system , and we showed that there was excellent agreement , both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "as with the first method , the histograms of the probability density , @xmath100 of the @xmath10 and @xmath12 values agree very well .",
    "it should be noted that the use of these two reduction methods is not constrained to problems in epidemiology , but rather may be used for many types of physical problems .",
    "for some generic systems , such as the singularly perturbed , damped duffing oscillator , either reduction method can be used since the terms in the normal form coordinate transform which lead to the average stochastic center manifold being different from the deterministic center manifold occur at very high order  @xcite .",
    "in other words , the average stochastic center manifold and deterministic center manifold are virtually identical . for the seir model considered in this article , there are terms at low order in the normal form transform which cause a significant difference between the average stochastic center manifold and the deterministic manifold . therefore ,",
    "as we have demonstrated , when working with the seir model , one must use the normal form coordinate transform method to correctly project the noise onto the center manifold .    in summary",
    ", we have presented a new method of stochastic model reduction that allows for impressive improvement in time series prediction .",
    "the reduced model captures both the amplitude and phase accurately for a temporal scale that is many orders of magnitude longer than the typical relaxation time .",
    "since sufficient statistics of disease data are limited due to short time series collection , the results presented here provide a potential method to properly model real , stochastic disease data in the time domain .",
    "such long - term accuracy of the reduced model will allow for the application of effective control of a disease where phase differences between outbreak times and vaccine controls are important . additionally ,",
    "since our method is general , it may be applied to very high - dimensional epidemic models , such as those involving adaptive networks . from a dynamical systems viewpoint , the reduction method has the potential to accurately capture new , emergent dynamics as we increase the size of the random fluctuations .",
