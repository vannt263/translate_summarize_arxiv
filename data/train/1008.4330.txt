    "cosmic rays ( crs ) fill up the entire volume of galaxies , providing an important source of heating and ionisation of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and may play a significant role in the regulation of star formation and evolution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "diffuse emissions from radio to high - energy @xmath0-rays ( @xmath3100 mev ) arising from various interactions between crs and the ism , interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , and magnetic field , are currently the best way to trace the intensities and spectra of crs in the milky way ( mw ) and other galaxies .",
    "gamma rays are particularly useful in this respect since this energy range gives access to the dominant hadronic component in crs via the observation of @xmath1-decay radiation produced by cr nuclei inelastically colliding with the interstellar gas . understanding the global energy budget of processes related to the injection and propagation of crs , and how the energy is distributed across the electromagnetic spectrum , is essential to interpret the radio / far - infrared relation @xcite , galactic calorimetry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and predictions of extragalactic backgrounds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and for many other studies .",
    "the mw is the best studied non - agn dominated star - forming galaxy , and the only galaxy that direct measurements of cr intensities and spectra are available .",
    "however , because of our position inside , the derivation of global properties is not straightforward and requires detailed models of the spatial distribution of the emission . nevertheless , constructing a model for the global properties of such",
    "a galaxy is tractable with the variety of data available .    in this paper , we calculate the injected cr power and corresponding broad - band luminosity spectrum from radio to @xmath0-rays for cr propagation models consistent with current cr , radio , and @xmath0-ray data",
    ". earlier estimates focussing on the mw @xmath0-ray luminosity only ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were based on modelling egret data .",
    "the launch of the large area telescope ( lat ) on the _ fermi _   _ gamma - ray space telescope _",
    "( hereafter , _",
    "fermi_lat ) , has provided a wealth of new @xmath0-ray data up to , and beyond , 100 gev .",
    "analysis of the _ fermi_lat  data has not confirmed the anomalous `` egret gev - excess '' @xcite and has led to an improved model of cr propagation and diffuse @xmath0-ray emission thus enabling a better estimate of the cr and @xmath0-ray luminosities of the galaxy .",
    "we use a model based on the galprop code for the cr - related processes in the galaxy that has been adjusted to fit many types of data including direct measurements of crs , non - thermal radio emission , hard x - rays , and @xmath0-rays .",
    "studies of the diffuse galactic emission and crs using this code prior to the launch of the _ fermi_lat  can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "an extensive review of cr propagation , models , data , and literature is given by @xcite .",
    "we calculate diffuse emissions from radio to @xmath0-rays , produced by cr protons , helium , and electrons / positrons . the contributions by discrete sources and line emissions ( e.g. , 511-kev annihilation radiation ) are not included .",
    "since the propagation parameters are not uniquely determined from the observations we consider an illustrative range of parameters for diffusive - reacceleration ( dr ) and plain diffusion ( pd ) propagation models . the main uncertainty we consider is the cr confinement volume and associated propagation model parameters , e.g. , the diffusion coefficient .",
    "other effects to consider would include different propagation modes , such as convection , the distribution of cr sources , etc . however , these are outside the scope of the current paper and we defer these to future work .",
    "the output of a typical galprop run includes cr distributions , @xmath0-ray / synchrotron skymaps and emissivity distributions .",
    "the luminosities of the different components are computed by integrating the respective emissivities over the total galactic volume : for ic and synchrotron radiation the volume emissivity is directly calculated , while for @xmath1-decay and bremsstrahlung the emissivity is calculated per hydrogen atom so we weight the calculated volume emissivities by the distributions of atomic , molecular , and ionised hydrogen included in the galprop code @xcite .",
    "we obtain the _ input _ cr luminosity for each of our models by integrating the model cr source spectra and spatial distribution over the galaxy .",
    "the injected luminosity , instead of emergent , is the relevant quantity because we are interested in how the cr power is transferred to the electromagnetic channels .",
    "in addition to cr protons and helium , and primary electrons , we also calculate the luminosities of secondary positrons and electrons resulting from cr - gas interactions in the ism .",
    "the diffuse emissions from these secondary cr species are also calculated and included in the total synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , and ic spectra .",
    "we use dr and pd propagation models where the spatial diffusion coefficient d@xmath4 and its momentum dependence , together with the diffusive reaccelation characterised by an alfvn speed , @xmath5 , assuming a kolmogorov spectrum of interstellar turbulence ( if used ) , and the size of the cr confinement volume , @xmath6 , are obtained by fitting the cr secondary / primary ratios for b / c and @xmath7be/@xmath8be ; for details see @xcite .",
    "the cr source injection spectra are taken as broken power - laws in momentum , with different parameters for nuclei and primary electrons .",
    "these are chosen to reproduce the directly observed cr spectra after propagation for the adopted models .",
    "the calculations are based on model parameters that reproduce the _ fermi_lat  electron spectrum @xcite and @xmath0-ray data @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of the cr sources is based on pulsars as tracers of supernova remnants ( snrs ) used in @xcite , but constant beyond the solar circle as indicated by analysis of the _ fermi_lat  data for the @xmath9 galactic quadrant @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron calculation uses the same cr electron model and a magnetic field model that reproduces radio surveys at frequencies from 100 mhz to 23 ghz ( strong et al . _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "diffusive - reacceleration and pd propagation models are used for three halo sizes , @xmath10 2 , 4 , and 10 kpc , respectively , with corresponding self - consistently derived diffusion coefficients @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the dimensionless particle velocity , @xmath13 is the particle rigidity , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 are constants .",
    "these halo sizes cover the range consistent with available cr data for b / c and @xmath7be/@xmath8be ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the parameters and values for the models are summarised in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "the optical to far infrared ( fir ) luminosity spectrum is derived from the model of the isrf used for the propagation calculations ( the  maximum metallicity gradient  model from * ? ? ?",
    "the emergent luminosity for the isrf is computed by surface integration over a region large enough to encompass the total flux from the stellar luminosity distribution and the starlight reprocessed by dust ( @xmath1730 kpc radius about the galactic centre ) . in the present work ,",
    "the input bolometric stellar luminosity is @xmath17@xmath18 apportioned across the stellar components boxy bulge / thin disc / thick disc / halo with fractions @xmath170.1/0.7/0.1/0.1 , and @xmath1720% reprocessed by dust and emitted in the infrared .",
    "the uncertainties related to the distribution of the isrf interior to the integration boundary include the relative luminosities of the bulge component and the disk , the metallicity gradient , and other details .",
    "however , these uncertainties are dominated by the overall uncertainty in the input stellar luminosity . a higher input stellar luminosity will increase the cr electron / positron losses via ic scattering and hence the overall output in @xmath0-rays , requiring a higher injected cr power and increasing the overall calorimetric efficiency ( see below ) .",
    "estimates available in the literature illustrating the range for the mw stellar luminosity are , e.g. , @xmath19 @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21 @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the broad - band luminosity spectrum of the galaxy , including the input luminosity for crs for a 4 kpc halo for a dr and pd model , respectively .",
    "[ fig2 ] illustrates the detailed energy budget for the dr model with 4 kpc halo size .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the broad - band luminosities for dr and pd models for the 3 halo sizes , and table  [ table:2 ] summarises the spectrally - integrated luminosity for the various components for each of our models .",
    "the peak injected cr luminosities differ by a factor @xmath22 for different propagation modes , but the total injected cr luminosities are close , only differing at the @xmath17few precent level .",
    "the injected cr spectra differ between dr and pd models to compensate the momentum dependence of the diffusion coefficient in each propagation model so that the local cr spectra are reproduced .",
    "independent of propagation mode , the relative decrease in the injected cr proton and helium luminosities is @xmath23% for halo sizes 2 to 10 kpc . for smaller halo sizes , the crs escape quicker requiring more injected power to maintain the local cr spectrum .",
    "in addition , for larger halo sizes cr sources located at further distances can contribute to the local spectrum , which is our normalisation condition , hence less power is required .",
    "in contrast to nuclei , the injected primary cr electron luminosity _ increases _ with @xmath6 , reflecting the increased input power of these particles required to counter the energy losses from the larger confinement region and escape time .",
    "the cr nuclei luminosities can be directly compared with the well - known approximate estimate from cr `` grammage '' as described by , e.g. , @xcite , which shows these can be estimated from the observed secondary / primary ratios .",
    "the values in table  [ table:2 ] are within a factor 2 of the @xmath17@xmath24 erg s@xmath25 derived in that paper , providing a consistency check on our more detailed modelling . taking the cr luminosities and adopting a supernova rate of ( @xmath26/century @xcite we obtain a cr energy input per snr of @xmath27 erg , comparable to standard estimates of a 510% efficiency for cr acceleration in snrs .    for the dr model ,",
    "the injected cr lepton luminosity is close to the total of synchrotron , ic , and bremsstrahlung luminosities for the 10 kpc halo ( model 3 ) , showing that the galaxy is approximately a lepton calorimeter ( @xmath17@xmath28% efficiency ) in this case , with the bulk of the energy lost via ic emission ( only about one third is lost via synchrotron emission ) .",
    "smaller halos still constitute fair calorimeters but are less efficient : @xmath17@xmath29% for the case of a 2 kpc halo with @xmath17@xmath30% of the energy loss due to synchrotron radiation , and @xmath17@xmath31% for the case of a 4 kpc halo with @xmath17@xmath32% of the energy loss due to synchrotron radiation . for pd models the calorimetric efficiencies",
    "are decreased , but the same trend of higher efficiency with increasing halo size is evident .",
    "our calculations show that calorimetry holds for cr leptons in mw - like galaxies independent of propagation mode provided the size of the cr confinement volume is large enough to allow for sufficient cooling _ and _ if @xmath0-ray production is included .",
    "a large fraction of the ic luminosity is at energies below 100 mev , extending to hard x - rays , and includes a significant secondary electron / positron component @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the synchrotron emission from secondary electrons and positrons is @xmath33 for our galaxy - like models , being largest for small halo sizes . for dr models ,",
    "the secondary lepton emission is 20% , 16% , and 16% for 2 , 4 , and 10 kpc , respectively . for pd models ,",
    "the secondary lepton emission is 12% , 10% , and 10% for 2 , 4 , and 10 kpc respectively .    using the standard definition of the fir / radio relation , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 ( w m@xmath36 ) is the fir flux from @xmath37@xmath38 @xmath39 m and @xmath40 ( w m@xmath36 hz@xmath25 ) is the radio flux at 1.4 ghz @xcite",
    ", we calculate this ratio for our luminosity models ( see table  [ table:2 ] under `` radio - fir relation '' ) .",
    "the range of values @xmath41 is consistent with that for the correlation over normal and starburst galaxies : @xmath42 @xcite and near to the value for m33 ( 2.50 ) given in that paper .",
    "note , here we have used the fir luminosity from the isrf model described earlier , @xmath43 erg s@xmath25 ( see table  [ table:2 ] ) .",
    "however , the fir luminosity of the galaxy is uncertain by at least a factor 2 and this will affect @xmath44 .",
    "using cobe / dirbe data , @xcite give a total ir luminosity @xmath45 erg s@xmath25 and ir luminosity @xmath46 @xmath39 m , ir@xmath47 , of @xmath48 erg s@xmath25 .",
    "this yields a fir luminosity of @xmath49 erg s@xmath25 from fir / ir@xmath50 for the isrf used in this paper .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite give a much higher value for ir@xmath51 , @xmath52 erg @xmath25 , yielding a fir luminosity @xmath53 erg s@xmath25 ( paladini , private communication ) .",
    "this higher value for the fir luminosity would increase all @xmath44 values in table  [ table:2 ] by 0.53 .",
    "the luminosity spectra for our models contains significant ic @xmath0-ray emission , the contribution at high energies depending on details of the propagation model . above @xmath17@xmath54",
    "gev the contribution by ic is non - negligible compared to @xmath1-decay .",
    "estimates of the isotropic background using models for the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission of normal star - forming galaxies invoking only @xmath1-decay as the dominant mode for high - energy production , e.g. , @xcite , and ignoring details of the propagation will underestimate the contribution per galaxy by these classes of objects .",
    "the present estimates are intended to be illustrative , using a particular set of models ; the level of uncertainty is suggested by the range covered by the models which are far from exhaustive . in any case",
    "the general conclusions from this work are robust .",
