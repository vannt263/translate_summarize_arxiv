    "in this paper we present results from a monte carlo study of a special case of the brauer model .",
    "this model has appeared in the literature in different guises , and received the name brauer model only recently .",
    "originally , it was studied as a @xmath1-state solvable vertex model  @xcite and later as an o(@xmath1 ) symmetric , solvable lattice model  @xcite .",
    "more recently it was observed that the model could be seen as a model of paths on the lattice in which each closed path has a weight equal to  @xmath1 , where  @xmath1 can take non - integer values . in this language of paths",
    "each vertex can carry one of the following configurations of path segments , with the corresponding weights :    ( 220,30 ) ( 0,10 ) ( 20,0)(0,0)@xmath2 ( 110,0)(0,0)@xmath3 ( 200,0)(0,0)@xmath4    here the weights are chosen to be solutions of the yang - baxter ( or star - triangle ) equation  @xcite . although the integrability condition in the yang - baxter equation does not restrict  @xmath1 , the actual solution by means of the bethe ansatz was only extended to the integers  @xcite .",
    "the name brauer model was given to emphasise that the transfer matrix of the model is an element of the brauer algebra  @xcite .",
    "the model attracted particular attention in the limit @xmath5 when it describes the probability distribution of lattice paths taken by a particle that is scattered by randomly placed , static scatterers  @xcite .",
    "as such it can be viewed as a lorentz lattice gas , although in these applications the vertex weights are usually not chosen as above .",
    "another paradigm is coming from the analogy to the self - avoiding walk , as in the brauer model a walk is not permitted to traverse a lattice edge more than once .",
    "a walk subject to this condition and with no further restrictions on the vertices is called a self - avoiding trail ( sat )  @xcite .",
    "we will therefore refer to the paths in the brauer model as _",
    "trails_. here we study the model at @xmath0 on a bounded domain , and we will be interested in the distributions of special points on the boundary that are visited by one of the trails .",
    "this will be explained in more detail below .",
    "first we introduce some notation . for given angles @xmath6 and  @xmath7 in the range @xmath8 such that @xmath9 , we define @xmath10 as the triangle in the upper half of the complex plane with vertices at @xmath11 and  @xmath12 , such that the interior angle at  @xmath11 is  @xmath6 and the interior angle at  @xmath12 is  @xmath7 .",
    "by @xmath13 we will denote the third vertex of  @xmath10 . for a given angle @xmath14 and integer system size @xmath15 , let @xmath16 be the set of vertices @xmath17 .",
    "properly rescaled , this collection of vertices provides a nice covering of the isosceles triangle @xmath18 with base angle  @xmath19 , see figure  [ fig : brauertriangle ] .",
    "( 180,184 ) ( 0,0 )    we define the brauer model on  @xmath20 with @xmath0 as follows .",
    "each vertex of  @xmath20 can carry either of the three following configurations of trail segments :    ( 220,22 ) ( 0,0 ) ( -18,8)@xmath21 ( 83,8)@xmath22 ( 183,8)@xmath23 [ vertexstates ]    here , the third vertex state should be interpreted as a crossing .",
    "the state of each vertex is chosen from @xmath24 independently from the states of the other vertices , with the probabilities for the three states given by @xmath25 where @xmath26^{-1}$ ] provides the normalisation .",
    "two distant edges may or may not be connected to each other by a trail .",
    "the correlations of these events are expected to be isotropic in space for large distances , if the weights are chosen as in equation  ( [ equ : weights ] ) and vertices are arranged in space as in figure  [ fig : brauertriangle ] .",
    "the anisotropy of the weights is thus precisely compatible with the spatial anisotropy of the lattice , see  @xcite .",
    "each configuration of vertex states defines a collection of self - avoiding trails on the vertex set  @xmath20 .",
    "we will be interested only in those configurations in which one of these trails crosses the triangular domain from a given corner to the opposite side . to make this trail stay inside the triangle we have to impose suitable boundary conditions .",
    "we choose the boundary conditions as shown in figure  [ fig : brauertriangle ] . here",
    "it is assumed that the system size  @xmath27 is an even number , so that each side of the triangle carries an odd number of vertices . with these boundary conditions , one trail of the model",
    "must enter the triangle at the top or the lower - left corner , and stay inside the triangle until it leaves at the other of these two corners .    in our simulations",
    "we generate this particular self - avoiding trail dynamically as follows .",
    "initially , only the vertex states on the boundary are fixed according to the boundary conditions .",
    "the vertex states in the interior are still undecided .",
    "the trail starts from either the top or the lower - left corner of the triangle .",
    "the steps of the trail follow the trail segments of the vertex states .",
    "each time the trail meets a vertex whose state is still undetermined , we choose its state according to the probabilities @xmath28 , @xmath29 and  @xmath30 given above , and continue the random walk .",
    "the state of this vertex is fixed forever onwards .",
    "we stop the simulation as soon as the trail hits a vertex on the side of the triangle opposite the starting point .",
    "we want to study the distribution of the point where the trail hits the side opposite the starting point in the limit when  @xmath27 becomes large .",
    "in fact , we are interested in the distribution of the so - called _ hull _ generated by the trail up to the stopping time , that is , the collection of points in the triangle that are disconnected by the stopped trail from the side of the triangle opposite the starting point .",
    "this will be motivated in more detail in section  [ sec : locality ] .",
    "as we shall explain , the main motivation for our study of the hull distribution is the close connection between the brauer model and critical bond percolation , for which the hull distribution is known ( although rigorously only for critical site percolation on the triangular lattice ) .    to make the connection with bond percolation ,",
    "let us modify the model above by setting @xmath31 , and let @xmath28 and  @xmath29 be proportional to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "for any given configuration of the model , one can draw at every vertex either the horizontal or the vertical edge connecting the centres of two adjacent rhombi ( see figure  [ fig : brauertriangle ] ) , such that the drawn edge does not intersect a trail segment at that vertex .",
    "it is easy to see that the drawn edges constitute a configuration of bond percolation on a rectangular lattice together with the dual configuration . on the boundary",
    "we have a percolation cluster along the base and right side of the triangle and a dual cluster along the left side .",
    "note that as before , there is one special path in the model that crosses the triangle between the top and the lower - left corner , and that this path describes the interface between the cluster and the dual cluster attached to the boundary .",
    "this path is called the percolation exploration process .",
    "thus we can interpret the brauer model at @xmath0 as a variant of a loop model for percolation with the added possibility that the loops may cross .",
    "note that these crossings happen only with small probability , since @xmath30 is the smallest of the three weights .",
    "one can therefore expect a self - avoiding trail to explore space much like the exploration process of critical percolation , except that occasionally the trail may cross and possibly re - enter a part of space it has already explored .",
    "in section  [ sec : brauer ] we introduced the brauer model .",
    "it is believed that the scaling limit of this model is conformally invariant .",
    "moreover , a self - avoiding trail of the model has the locality property .",
    "the purpose of this section is to explain what we precisely mean by these two properties , and to discuss an important implication .    to explain conformal invariance ,",
    "suppose that for every domain in  @xmath34 with continuous boundary and suitable boundary conditions , we are given a probability measure on the collection of paths in that domain .",
    "then we say that this family of measures ( or the family of random paths they describe ) is conformally invariant if for any conformal map  @xmath35 from a domain  @xmath36 onto a domain  @xmath37 that maps corresponding boundary conditions onto each other , the image of the measure on paths in  @xmath36 by  @xmath35 coincides with the measure on paths in  @xmath37 .",
    "now let  @xmath38 be a triangle in the upper half of the complex plane with vertices at @xmath11 , @xmath12 and  @xmath39 , and suppose that  @xmath36 is of the form @xmath40 , where  @xmath41 is such that @xmath40 is simply connected and @xmath42 , see figure  [ fig : localityhull ] .",
    "let the map @xmath43 fix  @xmath39 and send @xmath44 $ ] onto the boundary arc  @xmath45 of @xmath46 containing  @xmath39 .",
    "consider a random path  @xmath47 in this triangle which starts in  @xmath39 and is stopped as soon as it hits the interval @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "then we say that  @xmath47 has the locality property if the path in  @xmath38 started from  @xmath39 and stopped at the first time when it hits @xmath49 , has the same distribution as the path in  @xmath36 started from  @xmath39 and stopped on @xmath49 .",
    "note that if  @xmath47 is conformally invariant , then the latter random path is the image of the former by  @xmath50 .    .",
    "the distribution of the hull is determined by the probabilities that it avoids sets  @xmath51 such as shown on the right . ]    for a local , conformally invariant path  @xmath47 in  @xmath38 , let  @xmath52 denote the first time when  @xmath47 hits the interval  @xmath48 $ ] , and set @xmath53 .",
    "then we define the _ hull _",
    "@xmath54 generated by the path as the set of points in  @xmath55 that are either on @xmath56 $ ] or are disconnected from @xmath57 by @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "observe that the distribution of this hull  @xmath54 is determined if we know for all sets  @xmath51 as in the previous paragraph the probability that @xmath58 .",
    "but by the locality property , this probability is exactly the probability that the path  @xmath47 in  @xmath59 stopped when it hits @xmath49 , is stopped in the interval  @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "using conformal invariance , this probability equals the probability that  @xmath60 is in the interval  @xmath61\\setminus\\partial a)$ ] , see figure  [ fig : localityhull ] .",
    "it follows that for local paths , the distribution of the hull  @xmath54 is determined by the distribution of the exit point  @xmath60 ( see  @xcite for an illuminating discussion ) .    to examine some concrete examples ,",
    "let  @xmath38 be an equilateral triangle ( in other words , take @xmath62 ) .",
    "then there are three known local and conformally invariant paths such that  @xmath60 has the uniform distribution .",
    "the first example is the trace of schramm - lwner evolution ( sle ) for @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the second example is a brownian motion in  @xmath38 which is reflected on the left side in the direction given by the vector @xmath64 and on the right side in the direction given by @xmath65  @xcite ( for details on reflected brownian motion , see section  [ sec : rbm ] ) .",
    "the third example is the scaling limit of the exploration process for critical site percolation on the triangular lattice in  @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "since the distribution of  @xmath60 is the same for these paths , by the result of the previous paragraph they generate hulls  @xmath54 with the same distribution .    as we explained in section",
    "[ sec : brauer ] , the brauer model studied here is closely related to critical percolation .",
    "one may therefore expect the distribution of the hull to be the same for the two models .",
    "this can be motivated further by the fact that any two local and conformally invariant processes in the plane which are started in the origin and stopped upon hitting the unit circle generate the same hull , namely that of a stopped brownian motion ( see  @xcite ) . in a bounded domain , however , our monte carlo study shows that the hull distributions for critical percolation and for the brauer model are not the same . instead , one of the results of this paper is that our numerical data are consistent with the hypothesis that in the scaling limit , the hull of the brauer model has the same distribution as that of a brownian motion which is reflected perpendicularly on the boundary of the domain .     of a local path in the triangle  @xmath38 , and of the random variables",
    "@xmath60 , @xmath66 and  @xmath67 . ]    to study the distribution of the hull for the brauer model , by locality it is in principle sufficient to look only at the distribution of the exit point  @xmath60 in a given triangle . however , for obvious reasons we prefer to consider more characteristics of the hull . for this purpose",
    "we introduce two new random variables @xmath66 and  @xmath67 associated with the hull  @xmath54 in the triangle  @xmath38 , as follows .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath68 the distance of the lowest point of the hull on the left side of  @xmath38 to the top  @xmath39 , and by @xmath69 the distance of the lowest point of the hull on the right side to the top  @xmath39 .",
    "thus , all three random variables @xmath60 , @xmath66 and  @xmath67 take values in the range  @xmath48 $ ] . see figure  [ fig : localxyz ] for an illustration .    in section  [ sec : rbm ] we shall compute the ( joint ) distributions of @xmath60 , @xmath66 and  @xmath67 for the case of reflected brownian motion .",
    "these distributions can then be compared with the corresponding distributions in the brauer model .",
    "the results of our monte carlo study of the hull distribution are discussed in section  [ sec : brauerdist ] . in section  [ sec : lastvisit ] we present simulation results for a different distribution , the last - visit distribution .",
    "in this section we define reflected brownian motion in triangles and summarize the main results on these processes . we recall that for given angles @xmath70 and  @xmath71 in the range @xmath8 such that @xmath72 , we define @xmath73 as the triangle in the upper half of the complex plane with vertices at @xmath11 and  @xmath12 , such that the interior angle at  @xmath11 is  @xmath70 and the interior angle at  @xmath12 is  @xmath71 . by @xmath74",
    "we denote the third vertex of  @xmath75 .",
    "let us now introduce the ( reflection ) angles @xmath76 and set @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "we want to consider a stochastic process  @xmath67 in  @xmath38 which is brownian motion in the interior , and which is reflected instantaneously in the direction given by @xmath79 or  @xmath80 when it hits the left or right side of  @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "such a process is called a reflected brownian motion with reflection vector fields @xmath79 and  @xmath80 on the sides of  @xmath38 .",
    "we write rbm@xmath81 to denote this process .",
    "note that the angles @xmath6 and  @xmath7 are the reflection angles measured with respect to the boundary .    more explicitly , an rbm@xmath81 in  @xmath38 may be defined as follows .",
    "let  @xmath82 be standard two - dimensional brownian motion .",
    "then an rbm@xmath83 in  @xmath38 is the unique process  @xmath67 such that @xmath84 where @xmath85 are continuous increasing real - valued processes adapted to  @xmath82 which satisfy @xmath86 and increase only when  @xmath67 is on the left , respectively right , side of  @xmath38 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  ( 2.4 ) ) .",
    "this process is well - defined up to the first time when  @xmath67 hits the interval  @xmath48 $ ] . for a characterisation and properties of these",
    "reflected brownian motions , see varadhan and williams  @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to show conformal invariance and locality for these processes , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "it was shown by lawler et al .",
    "@xcite that if we take an rbm@xmath87 in the equilateral triangle  @xmath88 , then the exit distribution is uniform .",
    "their arguments were generalised to isosceles triangles ( i.e.  the triangles @xmath89 ) by dubdat  @xcite , and then to the case of a generic triangle ( any @xmath75 such that @xmath90 , with a natural extension to the case @xmath91 ) by one of us  @xcite .",
    "these results show that an rbm@xmath81 in the triangle  @xmath10 has the uniform exit distribution . by conformal invariance",
    ", this also determines the exit distribution for an rbm@xmath81 in any triangle  @xmath75 , and using locality we can in fact compute the joint distribution of the exit point  @xmath60 and the lowest points @xmath66 and  @xmath67 of the hull on the two sides , as we show next .",
    "it turns out that the distributions of the random variables @xmath60 , @xmath66 and  @xmath67 can all be expressed in terms of conformal transformations of the upper half - plane onto triangles @xmath92 . by the schwarz - christoffel formula  @xcite , the unique conformal transformation of the upper half - plane onto  @xmath92 that fixes @xmath11 and  @xmath12 and maps  @xmath93 to  @xmath94 is given by @xmath95 by the substitution @xmath96 it is easy to show that @xmath97 we shall now explain how we can express the distribution functions for @xmath60 , @xmath66 and  @xmath67 in terms of these conformal transformations .",
    "the idea of the computation of @xmath98 $ ] is illustrated in figure  [ fig : jointsmall ] .",
    "consider an rbm@xmath81 in the triangle  @xmath73 started from the top  @xmath99 . let @xmath100 and  @xmath101 be the points on the left and right sides of  @xmath38 at distances @xmath102 and  @xmath103 from  @xmath39 , respectively . stop the rbm as soon as it hits the counter - clockwise arc from @xmath104 to  @xmath105 on the boundary ( the thick line in figure  [ fig : jointsmall ] ) .",
    "then the probability @xmath98 $ ] is just the probability that this process is stopped in the interval  @xmath106 .    , @xmath66 and  @xmath67 can be computed . as explained in the text , the joint probability @xmath98 $ ] is just @xmath107 . ]",
    "we now use conformal invariance and locality .",
    "let @xmath108 be the conformal map of  @xmath38 onto  @xmath10 that sends @xmath104 to  @xmath11 , @xmath105 to  @xmath12 and @xmath39 to  @xmath13 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : jointsmall ] .",
    "then we are looking for the probability that an rbm@xmath81 in  @xmath10 started from  @xmath13 and stopped when it hits  @xmath48 $ ] , is stopped in the interval  @xmath109 .",
    "but since the exit distribution of the rbm@xmath81 is uniform in  @xmath10 , this probability is simply @xmath107 .",
    "thus , @xmath110 = g(x)-g(0).\\ ] ] it remains to find an explicit form of the map  @xmath108 .",
    "at this point it is useful to denote by  @xmath111 the third angle of the triangle @xmath75 , that is , @xmath112 .",
    "the explicit form of  @xmath35 can be obtained by suitably combining conformal self - maps of the upper half - plane with triangle mappings . how this is done",

    "the joint distributions of these variables are recorded similarly , but instead of using @xmath135  bins on the sides we use @xmath143  bins to reduce memory requirements .    in this way",
    "the simulations build up histograms of the marginal and joint distributions of @xmath60 , @xmath66 and  @xmath67 for the self - avoiding trail that can be compared to the corresponding distributions for the reflected brownian motions . to improve the statistics , we first merge together bins of collected data in order to distribute the numbers of trails in different bins more evenly .",
    "we shall explain below how this merging procedure works for the joint distribution of @xmath60 , @xmath66 and  @xmath67 .",
    "a similar procedure is applied for the joint distributions of two of the three random variables and for the marginal distributions .    for the joint distribution of @xmath60 , @xmath66 and  @xmath67 , from our simulations",
    "we have a total of @xmath144 cubical bins that span the unit cube with the variables @xmath60 , @xmath66 and  @xmath67 along the axes .",
    "we consider merging together either @xmath145 , or @xmath146 , or @xmath147 of these cubical bins into larger cubical bins , that together with the unmerged bins form a partition of the unit cube .",

    "moreover , we want each bin that represents at least @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) of the total number of generated trails to be present in the final partition .",
    "the merging procedure therefore works as follows .",
    "first , we consider for each of the @xmath145 cubes whether it should form a large bin , or be built up from smaller bins .",
    "so we do the following test : if we would built it up from @xmath147 bins , then would each constituting bin contain at least @xmath135 trails , or would one of these bins contain at least @xmath150 trails ?",
    "if so , the @xmath145 cube is split into @xmath147 cubes .",
    "then we test whether each of these @xmath147 cubes should form a bin , or be built up from @xmath151 bins , by the same criterion as above . otherwise , we test whether the @xmath145 cube can be built up from @xmath146 ( rather than @xmath147 ) cubes .",
    "if so , we test whether each of these @xmath146 cubes should form a bin , or be built up from @xmath151 bins , as before . in the end , we achieve a more even distribution of trails over a smaller number of bins , as desired .",

    "see table  [ tab : fittedvalues ] for the corresponding values of @xmath6 and  @xmath7 . ]    as we explained , we want to compare the distribution of the hull generated by the trails with the hull distribution of reflected brownian motion , in particular in the limit when the system size becomes large .",
    "our working hypothesis is therefore that the binned data collected in the simulations is predicted by the joint distribution function  ( [ equ : joint ] ) for the rbm with parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 for some @xmath6 and  @xmath7 as @xmath154 . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we make a least - squares fit of the parameters @xmath6 and  @xmath7 for each system size  @xmath27 . for every triangle @xmath18 on which we have simulated the model and for each of the two possible starting points , this gives us a list of the best - fit values for @xmath6 and  @xmath7 for 12  different system sizes .",

    "it is known that on the event  @xmath180 , the last point visited on the right side of the triangle  @xmath38 by an sle(6 ) process must be also the lowest point of the hull on the right side . for an rbm@xmath87 ,",
    "however , the last point visited on the right side is almost surely not the lowest point of the hull .",
    "let us now return to our simulations of the exploration path of critical percolation .",
