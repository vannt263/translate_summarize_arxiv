    "the role of electron - phonon ( @xmath2-ph ) interaction in the high-@xmath3 superconductivity has received considerable attention since the discovery of oxygen isotope effect of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bi2212 ) in the angle - resolved photoemission spectra ( arpes)@xcite . the experimental data show that electronic band is shifted slightly with the @xmath4o/@xmath5o substitution , signifying the existence of @xmath2-ph interplay in cuprates . besides , theoretically clarifying this effect is of great significance , for the energy scale of shifts reported by the two groups in refs . @xcite and @xcite seem quite inconsistent with each other , and many questions still remain up to now . in order to have an insight into the isotope effect ,",
    "in this work , we develop a new path - integral theory to calculate the photoemission spectra ( pes ) of cuprate superconductors , in which the electron - electron ( @xmath2-@xmath2 ) and @xmath2-ph correlations are treated on an equal footing .",
    "this theory is also applicable to other kind correlated materials . as an example , here , we also study the pes of boron - doped diamond ( bdd ) , which undertakes a semiconductor - metal phase transition on doping , and becomes a superconductor with the temperature decreases@xcite .",
    "the details of our theory will be presented in the next section , in connection with the study on isotope effect .",
    "calculation and discussion on pes of bdd are included in section 3 .",
    "a concluding remark can be found in the summary .",
    "in the cuo@xmath0 plane of cuprates , the electronic transfer is modulated by the vibration of oxygen atoms between the initial and final cu sites ( see in fig .",
    "1 ) , resulting in an off - diagonal type @xmath2-ph coupling . in order to qualitatively clarify the isotope effect of bi2212",
    ", we start from a half - filled hamiltonian including the @xmath2-@xmath2 repulsion and the above mentioned off - diagonal @xmath2-ph coupling ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 throughout this paper ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath11 at the cu site @xmath12 on a square lattice ( fig .",
    "the electrons hop between two nearest neighboring cu sites , denoted by @xmath13 , with a transfer energy @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the strength of coulomb repulsion between two electrons on the same cu site with opposite spins .",
    "the oxygen phonon is assumed to be of the einstein type with a frequency @xmath16 and a mass @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the mass change factor of phonon due to the isotope substitution . in the third term",
    ", @xmath20 is the dimensionless coordinate operator of the oxygen phonon locating between the nearest - neighboring cu sites @xmath12 and @xmath21 , and the sum denoted by @xmath22 just means a summation over all the phonon sites in the lattice .",
    "conduction plane in cuprates .",
    "the copper atom ( white circle ) is on the @xmath12-th site of a simple square lattice , where the electrons ( arrows ) reside .",
    "the oxygen atom ( black circle ) is located between the nearest - neighboring cu sites , and @xmath23 denotes its displacement from the equilibrium position . ]    in the conduction plane of cuo@xmath0 , the electronic hopping integral @xmath24 can be expanded to the second order terms with respect to the phonon displacements @xmath20 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the bare hopping energy and @xmath27 the off - diagonal quadratic @xmath2-ph coupling constant . here",
    "we note the linear @xmath2-ph coupling does not occur owing to the lattice symmetry of present model . whereas the inter - site @xmath2-@xmath2 interaction is included in the screened values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .      in this section ,",
    "we develop a path - integral theory for a model with both @xmath2-@xmath2 and @xmath2-ph interactions . by making use of the trotter s decoupling formula ,",
    "the boltzmann operator is written as , @xmath28 applying the hubbard - stratonovitch transformation@xcite and the gaussian integral formula@xcite , we can decouple the two - body parts , so that the @xmath2-@xmath2 and @xmath2-ph correlated terms are replaced by a two - fold summation over the auxiliary spin and lattice configurations , which is the so - called path - integral . in this way",

    ", we also define the one - body green s function [ @xmath47 on a path @xmath34 as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the heisenberg representation of @xmath10 .",
    "it is really time - dependent and defined by @xmath50 meanwhile , the ordinary green s function [ @xmath51 can be obtained by the path - integral as @xmath52 this path - integral is evaluated by the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulation method .",
    "if the qmc data of green s function @xmath53 is obtained , we can immediately calculate its fourier component [ @xmath54 as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the momentum of the outgoing photo - electron . from this fourier component @xmath57",
    ", we derive the momentum - specified spectral function [ @xmath58 by solving the integral equation @xmath59      we now present the qmc results on a 4@xmath604 square lattice , where @xmath26 is set as the unit of energy , and @xmath16=1.0 is used . for the qmc simulation , we impose a little large isotopic mass enhancement , @xmath61=1 and @xmath18=2 , to suppress the numerical error . in this calculation , we determine the binding energy @xmath62 by the moment analysis of the spectral function as @xmath63 .",
    "correspondingly , the isotope induced band shift is calculated by @xmath64 .     with @xmath27 on a 4@xmath604 square lattice , when @xmath15=2.0 , @xmath65=10 , @xmath61=1 , @xmath18=2 .",

    "three different values of @xmath27 are used to show the @xmath27-dependence of @xmath66 .",
    "the discrete symbols are the results of qmc , and continuous curves by hfa as a reference . ]    in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we plot the ratio @xmath66 versus @xmath27 , at @xmath15=2.0 and @xmath65=10 , where @xmath67 is the band shift at the @xmath68 point of brillouin zone [ @xmath69=(0,0 ) ] , and @xmath70 is the isotopic change of phonon energy .",
    "the filled circles are calculated by qmc , and the solid curve by the mean - field theory with hartree - fork approximation ( hfa ) as a guide for eyes . here",
    "both theories figure out an increase of @xmath66 with @xmath27 , which means if the @xmath2-ph coupling is strong enough , a large band shift can be generated in a small cost of @xmath70 . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the ratio @xmath66 versus @xmath15 are shown for three different @xmath27 s , where the discrete symbols and continuous curves are the qmc and hfa results , respectively .",
    "one can see the ratio @xmath66 increases with @xmath27 . meanwhile , for a fixed @xmath27 , the ratio declines slightly as @xmath15 increases , indicating that the band shift is owing to the @xmath2-ph coupling , whereas the presence of @xmath15 partially reduces this effect . according to fig .",
    "2 , the band shift thus can be regarded as a measure of the effective @xmath2-ph coupling strength in the system .",
    "it is well known that the pristine diamond is a big band gap insulator .",
    "lightly doped with boron , it shows a @xmath71-type character with an activation energy about 0.37 ev@xcite .",
    "recently , the research on bdd has become highly attractive since the remarkable discovery of superconductivity in this material@xcite . accompanied with the superconducting phase ,",
    "a semiconductor - metal transition also occurs when the doping percentage is increased to certain level . in the normal metallic state , k. ishizaka _",
    "et al_.@xcite declared the observation of a step - like multi - phonon satellite structure in the valence band pes , approximately distributed periodically in 0.150 ev below the fermi level , in addition to the emergence of a clear fermi edge .",
    "this periodic structure in pes reminds us of a similarity to the case of localized electron@xcite , wherein the coupling between electron and einstein phonons characterizes the spectra with discrete peaks at equal distance .",
    "moreover , the fermi edge and the step - like structure are observed together , probably originating from a co - existence of the two basic properties of electrons : itineracy and localization . in order to clarify this so - called co - existence theoretically",
    ", we apply our path - integral theory to the many - impurity - holstein ( mih ) model on a doped simple cubic lattice to derive its spectral density .",
    "the mih model includes the following two properties .",
    "one is the disorder of the system , that some atoms are replaced by dopant ones in a certain ratio .",
    "the other is the coupling between electrons and einstein phonons , being the simplest description of @xmath2-ph interactions .",
    "its hamiltonian is given as , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the transfer energy .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 are the creation and annihilation operators of electron with spin @xmath11 at site @xmath12 .",
    "electrons can hop only between the nearest neighboring sites expressed by @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath77 stands for the chemical potential of electrons and @xmath78 is the potential difference between after and before substitution at the doped sites labeled by @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 is the dimensionless coordinate operator for the phonon at site @xmath12 with frequency @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath82 denotes the _",
    "e_-ph coupling constant .",
    "@xmath83 is the average electron number at site @xmath12 . to simplify the problem",
    ", we just consider the coupling at the doped sites hereafter , because in the pure diamond there is no evidence that the satellite structure appears , which suggests the coupling is important only after doping .    by applying our path - integral theory to the disordered system , and following the formulation in section 2.2",
    ", we obtain an electronic green s function similar to eq . 12 , @xmath84 in the numerical calculation , the path - integral of green s function in eq .",
    "16 is also performed by the qmc simulation method as before . after averaging this site - dependent green s function over all the @xmath85 sites of the system ,",
    "the photoemission spectral function [ @xmath86 can be reproduced through the analytic continuation as , @xmath87 finally , after imposing the fermi - dirac function @xmath88 $ ] , the pes intensity is given as @xmath89 , which can be compared with the experimental data .",
    "since we focus on the spectral region close to the fermi level , we use a simple cubic lattice of @xmath90 in real calculation without paying much attention to the detail of carbon valence band . as we just count the @xmath2-ph coupling at the doped sites ,",
    "the phonon effect is not obvious in the whole system pes after averaging over all sites .",
    "for this reason , in the following , we will also present the pes of doped sites to illustrate the phonon effect .",

    "3 shows the spectra for the simple cubic lattice at light ( 3.12% ) and heavy ( 12.5% ) doping rates , with a weak @xmath2-ph coupling of @xmath82=0.25 ev . from the whole system",
    "pes ( full lines ) , one can clearly see the emergence of a fermi edge with the increase of doping percentage . in the lightly doped case ,",
    "the impurity levels are a little above the top of valence band , indicating the system is a semiconductor . while in the heavily doped case",
    ", the impurity band expands to overlap the top of valence band and closes the activation gap , leading to a semiconductor - metal phase transition . in the spectra of boron - doped sites ( dotted lines ) ,",
    "one notices that , in addition to a broad hump due to the so - called fano effect@xcite , a satellite structure also appears in each case a little below the fermi level .",
    "we should note this side structure is just the quantum phonon peak due to the @xmath2-ph coupling .",
    "meanwhile , because of the fano effect , this phonon structure is modified by the impurity band to have a shoulder - like shape , rather than a @xmath91-like form as in the localized electron case of ref .",

    "4 , we show the spectra of a system with a strong @xmath2-ph coupling of @xmath82=0.50 ev , and a low doping rate of 3.12% . comparing with fig .",
    "3(a ) , one clearly finds that , a large @xmath2-ph coupling at the doped sites greatly contributes to the expansion of impurity band , so that the fermi edge is clearly observed in the whole system pes ( full line ) .",
    "moreover , the second phonon side peak also appears due to the multi - phonon processes aroused by the strong @xmath2-ph coupling , corresponding to a step - like structure in the whole system pes , as affirmed in the inset .",
