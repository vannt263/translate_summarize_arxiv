    "experimental studies of the critical behavior of real materials are often confronted with the influence of impurities and inhomogeneities @xcite . for a proper interpretation of the measurements it is , therefore",
    ", important to develop a firm theoretical understanding of the effect of such random perturbations . in many situations",
    "the typical time scale of the thermal fluctuations in the idealized  pure \" systems is clearly separated from the time scale of the impurity dynamics , such that to a very good approximation the impurities can be treated as quenched .",
    "the importance of the effect of quenched random disorder on the critical behavior of a physical system can be classified by the specific heat exponent of the pure system , @xmath6 .",
    "the criterion due to harris @xcite asserts that for @xmath7 quenched random disorder is a relevant perturbation , leading to a different critical behavior than in the pure case ( which is the case of the three - dimensional ising model ) .",
    "in particular , one expects @xcite in the disordered system that @xmath8 , where @xmath4 is the correlation length exponent and @xmath9 is the dimension of the system .",
    "assuming hyper - scaling to be valid , this implies @xmath10 . on the other hand for @xmath11 disorder",
    "is irrelevant ( as is the case of the three - dimensional heisenberg model ) and , in the marginal case @xmath12 , no prediction can be made .",
    "for the case of ( non - critical ) first - order phase transitions it is known that the influence of quenched random disorder can lead to a softening of the transition @xcite .",
    "recently , the predicted softening effect at first - order phase transitions has been confirmed for 3d q - state potts models with @xmath13 using monte carlo @xcite and high temperature series expansion @xcite techniques .",
    "the overall picture is even better in two dimensions ( @xmath14 ) where several models with @xmath7 @xcite and the marginal ( @xmath12 ) @xcite have been investigated .    in this paper",
    "we study another type of quenched random disorder , namely @xmath15 @xmath16 , a generic property of random lattices whose local coordination number varies randomly from site to site . specifically , we consider @xmath14 poissonian random lattices of voronoi - delaunay type , and performed an extensive computer simulation study of a blume - capel model .",
    "we concentrated on the close vicinity of the transition point and applied finite - size scaling ( fss ) techniques to extract the exponents and the  renormalized charges \" @xmath17 and @xmath18 . to achieve the desired accuracy of the data in reasonable computer time we applied the single - cluster hybrid algorithm @xcite to update the spins and furthermore made extensively use of the re - weighting technique @xcite .",
    "previous studies of connectivity disorder focusing mainly on @xmath14 lattices have been realized by monte carlo simulations of @xmath19-state potts models on quenched random lattices of voronoi - delaunay type for @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite and @xmath22 @xcite . in particular , it has been shown that for @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21 @xcite the critical exponents are the same as those for the model on a regular @xmath14 lattice .",
    "this is indeed a surprising result since the relevance criterion of the delaunay triangulations reduces to the well known harris criterion such that disorder of this type should be relevant for any model with positive specific heat exponent @xcite .",
    "this means that for @xmath21 , where @xmath7 , one would expect a different universality class . on the other hand , for the present spin-3/2 model , where @xmath12 , we show that the exponents indeed change in the voronoi - delaunay lattice type , turning out the situation still more bizarre . in the next section we present the model and the simulation background .",
    "the results and conclusions are discussed in the last section .",
    "the voronoi construction or tessellation for a given set of points in the plane is defined as follows @xcite .",
    "initially , for each point one determines the polygonal cell consisting of the region of space nearer to that point than any other point .",
    "then one considers that the two cells are neighboring when they possess an extremity in common . from the voronoi tessellation",
    "the dual lattice can be obtained by the following procedure : @xmath23 when two cells are neighbors , a link is placed between the two points located in the cells ; @xmath24 from the links one obtains the triangulation of space that is called the delaunay lattice ; @xmath25 the delaunay lattice is dual to the voronoi tessellation in the sense that points corresponding to cells link to edges , and triangles to the vertices of the voronoi tessellation .",
    "we consider now the two - dimensional spin-@xmath0 blume - capel model on this poissonian random lattice .",
    "the blume - capel model is a generalization of the standard ising model @xcite and was originally proposed for spin-@xmath26 to account for first - order phase transition in magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath27 where the first sum runs over all nearest - neighbor pairs of sites ( points in the voronoi construction ) and the spin-@xmath0 variables @xmath28 assume values @xmath29 . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath30 is the exchange coupling and @xmath31 is the single ion anisotropy parameter .",
    "the second sum is taken over the @xmath32 spins on a @xmath9-dimensional lattice .",
    "the case where @xmath33 has been extensively studied by several approximate techniques in two- and three - dimensions and its phase diagram is well established @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath34 has also been investigated according to several procedures @xcite .",
    "the simulations have been performed for @xmath35 , which is the simplest case , on different lattice sizes comprising a number @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 of sites . for simplicity",
    ", the length of the system is defined here in terms of the size of a regular lattice @xmath39 . for each system size quenched averages over the connectivity disorder are approximated by averaging over @xmath40 ( @xmath41 to @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 and @xmath38 ) independent realizations . for each simulation",
    "we have started with a uniform configuration of spins ( the results are however independent of the initial configuration ) .",
    "we ran @xmath47 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) per spin with @xmath48 configurations discarded for thermalization using the  perfect \" random - number generator @xcite .",
    "we have employed the hybrid algorithm @xcite where we included @xmath49 wolff clusters ( here @xmath50 ) intercalated by one metropolis single - spin flip sweep .",
    "this algorithm has been shown to be quite effective for spin-@xmath0 models @xcite . for every @xmath51th mcs ,",
    "the energy per spin , @xmath52 , and magnetization per spin , @xmath53 , were measure and recorded in a time series file .    from the series of the energy measurements we can compute , by re - weighting over a controllable temperature interval @xmath54 , the average energy and specific heat @xmath55_{av}/n,\\ ] ] @xmath56_{av},\\ ] ] where @xmath57 , with @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the boltzmann constant . in the above equations @xmath60 stands for thermodynamic averages and @xmath61_{av}$ ] for averages over the different realizations .",
    "similarly , we can derive from the magnetization measurements the average magnetization , the susceptibility , and the magnetic cumulants , @xmath62_{av},\\ ] ] @xmath63_{av},\\ ] ] @xmath64_{av},\\ ] ] @xmath65_{av}.\\ ] ] further useful quantities involving both the energy and magnetization are their derivatives @xmath66_{av}}{dk}=[<|m|e>-<|m|><e>]_{av},\\ ] ] @xmath67_{av}}{dk}=[\\frac{<|m|e>}{<|m|>}-<e>]_{av},\\ ] ] @xmath68_{av}}{dk}=[\\frac{<|m^{2}|e>}{<|m^{2}|>}-<e>]_{av}.\\ ] ] in the infinite - volume limit these quantities exhibit singularities at the transition point .",
    "in finite systems the singularities are smeared out and scale in the critical region according to @xmath69,\\ ] ] @xmath70_{av}=l^{-\\beta/\\nu}f_{m}(x)[1+ ... ],\\ ] ] @xmath71,\\ ] ] @xmath72_{av}}{dk}=l^{1/\\nu}f_{p}(x)[1+ ... ],\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is a regular background term , @xmath4 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are the usual critical exponents , and @xmath77 are fss functions with @xmath78 being the scaling variable , and the brackets @xmath79 $ ] indicate corrections - to - scaling terms .",
    "we calculated the error bars from the fluctuations among the different realizations .",
    "note that these errors contain both , the average thermodynamic error for a given realization and the theoretical variance for infinitely accurate thermodynamic averages which are caused by the variation of the quenched , random geometry of the lattices .",
    "by applying standard re - weighting techniques to each of the @xmath80 time - series data we first determined the temperature dependence of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , ... , @xmath83, ... ,@xmath80 , in the neighborhood of the simulation point @xmath84 .",
    "once the temperature dependence is known for each realization , we can easily compute the disorder average , e.g. , @xmath85 , and then determine the maxima of the averaged quantities , e.g. , @xmath86 .",
    "the variable @xmath80 represents the number of replicas in our simulations .    in order to estimate the critical temperature we calculate the second and fourth - order binder cumulants given by eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) , respectively .",
    "it is well known that these quantities are independent of the system size and should intercept at the critical temperature @xcite . in fig . [ cum ] the fourth - order binder cumulant is shown as a function of the @xmath87 for several values of @xmath32 . taking the largest lattices we have @xmath88 . to estimate @xmath89 we note that it varies little at @xmath90 so we have @xmath91 . from the second - order cumulant",
    "we similarly get @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "one can see that the agreement of the critical temperature is quite good and @xmath89 is definitely far from the universal value @xmath94 for the same model on the regular @xmath14 lattice .",
    "the correlation length exponent can be estimated from the derivatives given by eq .",
    "figure [ expnu ] shows the maxima of the logarithm derivatives as a function of the logarithm of the lattice size @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 . from the linear",
    "fitting one gets @xmath100 ( @xmath98 ) and @xmath101 ( @xmath99 ) , which is again different from the regular lattice exponent @xmath102 .",
    "log - log plot of the maxima of the logarithmic derivative @xmath103}{dk}$ ] versus the lattice size @xmath39 for @xmath98 ( circle ) and @xmath99 ( square ) .",
    "the solid lines are the best linear fits .",
    ", width=321 ]    in order to go further in our analysis we also computed the modulus of the magnetization at the inflection point and the maximum of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the logarithm of these quantities as a function of the logarithm of @xmath97 are presented in figures [ mag ] and [ sus ] , respectively .",
    "a linear fit of these data gives @xmath104 from the magnetization and @xmath105 from the susceptibility which should be compared to @xmath106 and @xmath107 obtained for a regular @xmath14 lattice .",
    "the specific heat can also be analysed in this case but , as it happens in other models @xcite , we can not find a clear unambiguous support for a definite scaling .",
    "figure [ sph ] shows the maximum of the specific heat @xmath109 as a function of @xmath97 .",
    "least - squares fits to a logarithmic ansatz @xmath110 give @xmath111 , @xmath112 and is shown by the full line in figure [ sph ] .",
    "the dashed line in this figure corresponds to a pure power - law ansatz , @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 . from these results one can slightly see a better agreement with the logarithmic ansatz .",
    "thus , from the above results , there is a strong indication that the spin-3/2 blume - capel model on a voronai lattice is in a different universality class than its regular lattice counterpart .",
    "this poses , in addition to the @xmath21 potts model in two dimensions , and taking into account the extensive study done janke and weigel on the harris - luck criterion for random lattices @xcite , another open question to be answered in more general terms .",
    "p. h. l. martins and j. a. plascak , to be published .",
    "in this work the use of the probability distribution function is used to show that the universality class of the @xmath14 diluted ising model is in fact the same as that of the pure model ."
