    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is a well known probe of the early universe .",
    "the acoustic peaks in the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies capture the physics of the primordial photon - baryon fluid undergoing oscillations in the potential wells of dark matter @xcite .",
    "the associated physics involving the evolution of a single photon - baryon fluid under compton scattering and gravity is both simple and linear @xcite .",
    "the acoustic peak structure has been well established with the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ; @xcite ) data . over the next several years , with the launch of the esa s planck surveyor , it is expected that the anisotropy power spectrum will be measured to the cosmic variance limit out to an angular scale of roughly ten arcminutes ( or multipoles @xmath1 2000 in the angular power spectrum ; see , review in @xcite ) .    beyond temperature anisotropies ,",
    "the focus is now on the polarization at medium to larger angular scales .",
    "when the universe was reionized , the temperature quadrupole rescattered at the reionization surface producing a new contribution to the polarization @xcite .",
    "such a signature has now been detected in the wmap data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cmb polarization field contains a signature of primordial gravitational waves , which is considered a smoking - gun signature for inflation as models of inflation predict a stochastic gravitational wave background in addition to the density perturbation spectrum @xcite .",
    "the distinct signature is in the form of a curl component , also called b - mode , of the two - dimensional polarization field @xcite .",
    "observation of the primordial b - modes is now the primary goal of a large number of ground- and balloon - borne cmb polarization experiments .",
    "there are also plans for a next generation cmb polarization mission as part of nasa s _ beyond einstein _ program ( _ inflation probe _ ) .",
    "the only known source for _ primordial _ b - modes is inflationary gravitational waves ( igws ) and a detection of this tensor component would be one of the biggest discoveries in science .",
    "the tensor component captures important physics related to the inflaton potential , especially the energy scale at which relevant models exit the horizon @xcite .",
    "cmb polarization observations are significantly impacted by foreground polarized radiation , with initial estimates suggesting that the minimum amplitude to which a gravitational wave background can be searched is not significantly below a tensor - to - scalar ratio of 10@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this limit based on analysis of foregrounds is well above the ultimate limit of a tensor - to - scalar ratio around @xmath3 due to the cosmic shear confusion , associated with secondary b - modes generated from e - modes by lensing due to intervening structure @xcite .",
    "if the optical depth is around 0.1 , then the ultimate limit may be pushed down an order of magnitude @xcite by measuring the large angle b mode polarization signal .    while the impact of foregrounds is now well appreciated",
    ", it is not fully clear how these foregrounds may be minimized in the next generation experiments .",
    "this issue critically impacts the planning of experiments . for the _ inflation probe _ or a ground - based experiment that attempts to target the gravitational wave background , one of the most significant issues to address is the choice of frequency bands for observations such that the foreground contamination is minimized . for example , should an experiment target the low - frequency end where synchrotron dominates , high - frequency end where dust dominates , or the frequency range between 50 ghz to 100 ghz where foreground polarization is minimum , but contributions from both synchrotron and dust are expected ? we find that frequency bands over a wide range from low frequencies dominated by synchrotron to high frequencies dominated by dust are required .",
    "furthermore , we also study the optimization problem of dividing a fixed number of detectors in the focal plane among the frequency bands .",
    "we looked into the question of whether the division should be such that one has equal noise in each band or whether we should concentrate more detectors in channels where foreground components dominate .    to address the issue of foreground contamination and the optimization necessary to minimize foregrounds",
    ", we made use of the recently released wmap polarization data @xcite .",
    "the wmap data has provided us with an estimate of the polarized synchrotron foregrounds at low frequencies . for dust polarization",
    ", we also made use of dust maps from ref .",
    "we considered several different experimental possibilities with frequency coverages either at the high - end or low - end of our frequency range as well as an experiment with several channels that cover the range from 30 ghz to 300 ghz .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss the simulated maps , summarize the foreground model and discuss the foreground removal method employed . in section  3",
    ", we will discuss contamination in example cmb experiments with two or more frequency bands spread over the broad range from 30 ghz to 300 ghz . in section  4 , we will consider the optimization of experiments such as _ inflation probe_. here optimization refers to the selection of frequency bands with total number of detectors kept fixed so as to minimize foreground confusion .",
    "we discuss our results and conclude with a summary in section  5 .",
    "our main results are two - fold .",
    "first , we quantify the effect of foregrounds on experiments with different frequency coverages and the improved sensitivity to b modes from adding future wmap or planck data .",
    "our results from this study are summarized in table [ tab : rmin ] .",
    "the second result concerns the optimal spacing of frequency bands for a cmb experiment that aims to detect primordial b - modes .",
    "we discuss the optimization in ",
    "iii while our results are summarized in table [ tab : freqopti ] .",
    ".example cmb polarization experiments used for the foreground analysis and their specifications in terms of the experimental noise , angular resolution and the sky area observed .",
    "+ notes :  + @xmath4 : experiments b and c are typical of ground - based experiments that target a small area on the sky with limited frequencies and concentrating on either low- or high - frequencies . experiment a is an example of a balloon - borne experiment with a large sky coverage .",
    "note that the sky area observed is 45% but we assume that a smaller area ( 34% ) is clean enough for cmb measurements .",
    "experiment d is consistent ( same as a , 100% observed but 13% used ) with one of the concept study designs of the _ inflation probe _ mission for high precision cmb polarization measurements .",
    "+ @xmath0 : the net ( noise - equivalent - temperature ) in units of @xmath5k@xmath6 is the focal plane sensitivity at each of the channels .",
    "this is equivalent to the net of a single detector divided by the square - root of the number of detectors . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      following the above procedure , we optimized the channel selection for the three sky cuts mentioned above and by making use of the single between @xmath7 of 2 and 100 to detect primordial b - modes .",
    "the `` optimal '' frequency distribution ( see , table  [ tab : freqopti ] ) is characterized by the dominance of the `` cmb channel '' ( here 150 ghz ) , which represents 40 to 60% of the total number of detectors , with adequate coverage at both high and low frequencies for removal of dust and synchrotron respectively .",
    "note that this optimization does not include data from other experiments since we have already seen that experiment d , which is our example space - based experiment , shows no improvement when combined with either 8 years of wmap data or planck data . as tabulated in table  [ tab : freqopti ] , frequency optimization is such that the number of detectors is higher in the primary cmb channel of 150 ghz than the number of detectors in other channels . in terms of the overall focal plane sensitivity ,",
    "the fractional contribution from detectors at 150 ghz is even higher since the instrumental noise for detectors at this frequency is the lowest ( see second line of table  [ tab : freqopti ] ) .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : freqopti ] , our algorithm also selected the two channels at both the lowest and highest frequencies to remove synchrotron and dust , representing respectively about 10 to 13 % and 28 to 32 % of the total number of detectors .",
    "this arrangement is necessary to study how the spectrum changes across the sky and the number of detectors is selected in such a way that the resulting noise associated with the uncertainty of the spectral indices of either one of the two foregrounds does not dominate the overall noise .",
    "we remind the reader that our spectral indices vary across the sky but they do nt change with frequency . in these foreground channel pairs ,",
    "the dominant ones are 45 ghz and 340 ghz ( in terms of the number of detectors at those channels ) because of their raw sensitivity , and the large number of detectors compensates for a smaller arm leverage ( see figure [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in our optimization almost 50% of the detectors go to the channel at 150 ghz which acts as the primary channel for cmb measurements .",
    "the achievable limits on the tensor - to - scalar ratio are highlighted in table  [ tab : opti ] .",
    "we tabulated results with and without lensing b - modes as a source of noise . if lensing b - modes could be reduced to a level lower than the residual foreground , the minimum @xmath8 achievable is 1.4@xmath9 obtained by covering 36% or 66% of the sky . including lensing as an irreducible noise such that @xmath10 leads to minimum tensor - to - scalar ratios of 1.8@xmath9 , 2.8@xmath9 , and 1.3@xmath11 for respectively 65.8 , 35.7 , 13.4 % sky coverage .",
    "the 66% sky coverage is more efficient on these very large scales , but the lensing b - modes provide a floor to the primordial b - mode detection there .",
    "however on these very large scales , this limit is sensitive to the exact shape of the b - mode reionization bump which in turn depends on the optical depth and the reionization history . in general ,",
    "our limits show that the suggested @xmath12 goal of the next generation _ inflation probe _ mission ( see the report of the task force on cmb research @xcite ) is achievable .    in the last column of table  [ tab : opti ] , we highlighted the improvement on the foreground residual and the minimum @xmath8 when the experiment is optimized relative to an experiment where all the detectors are equally distributed in number between the 8 channels , with 125 detectors per channel .",
    "as tabulated , optimization leads to roughly a 70% improvement in the foreground residual and a 2 to 80% improvement in the minimum tensor - to - scalar ratio measurable with each of the three options without lensing contamination .",
    "however when the lensing is the limiting factor , the 70% gain on the foreground level only leads to a 9% to a 27% improvement .    as discussed above , in addition to residual foreground noise , with a high sensitivity space - based experiment one must also account for the lensing b - mode signal that acts as another source of confusion @xcite . in table",
    "iv , we also listed the limits on tensor - to - scalar ratio when lensing is ignored so that one can compare the degradation related to lensing alone .",
    "as shown by the difference , with lensing included as a source of noise , the resulting constraints on the tensor - to - scalar ratio is a factor of 3 to 6 worse compared to the case when the confusion from lensing b - modes is not present .",
    "we highlighted this primarily due to the fact that techniques have been developed to reconstruct the lensing deflection angle and to partly reduce the b - mode lensing confusion when searching for primordial gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "these construction techniques make use of the non - gaussian signal generated in the cmb sky by gravitational lensing .",
    "the lensing signal has a unique non - gaussian pattern captured by a zero three - point correlation function and a non - zero four - point correlation function .",
    "this non - gaussian feature will be very useful for cleaning the lensing signal but detrimental when trying to measure it because of the increased sample variance @xcite . however , residual foregrounds are also non - gaussian and they could bias the extraction of the lensing signal .",
    "thus , in addition to an increase in the power - spectrum noise , foregrounds may also impact proposed techniques to clean the lensing signal . in an upcoming paper",
    ", we will discuss the impact of residual foregrounds on these lensing analyses .",
    "the b - modes of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization may contain a distinct signature of the primordial gravitational wave background that was generated during inflation and the amplitude of the background captures the energy scale of inflation .",
    "unfortunately , the detection of primordial cmb b - mode polarization is significantly confused by the polarized emission from foregrounds , mainly dust and synchrotron within the galaxy .",
    "based on polarized maps from wmap third - year analysis , which include information on synchrotron radiation at 23 ghz , and a model of the polarized dust emission map , we considered the ability of hypothetical cmb polarization experiments with frequency channels between 20 ghz and 300 ghz to separate primordial cmb from galactic foregrounds .",
    "planck data will aid experiments with narrow frequency coverage to reduce their foreground contamination and we found improvements of factors of 2 to 40 in their achievable @xmath8 .",
    "we also studied an optimization of the distribution of detectors among frequency channels of a cmb experiment with a fixed number of detectors in the focal plane .",
    "the optimal configuration ( to minimize the amplitude of detectable primordial b - modes ) requires observations in at least 5 channels widely spread over the frequency range between 30 ghz and 500 ghz with substantial coverage at frequencies around 150 ghz .",
    "if a low - resolution space experiment concentrates on roughly 66% of the sky with the least contamination , and with 1000 detectors reach a noise level of about 1000 ( nk)@xmath0 , the minimum detectable level of the tensor - to - scalar ratio would be about 0.002 at the 99% confidence level .",
    "the bulk of the sensitivity comes from the largest angular scales , i.e. , using the signal created during reionization .",
    "* acknowledgments : * we would like to acknowledge the use of the healpix package for our map pixelization @xcite and participants of the irvine conference on `` fundamental physics with cmb radiation '' for useful discussions and suggestions that led to this work .",
    "we thank the wmap flight team and nasa office of space sciences for making available processed wmap data public from the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) .",
