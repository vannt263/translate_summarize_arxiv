    "the production of gravitational waves by binary systems , in the limit in which mass and momentum transfer do not occur , has been well described with high accurate precision with both the post - newtonian and the post - minkowskian approaches .",
    "these are the most useful tools in general relativity to provide good estimates of the features of the gravitational wave sources .",
    "recently , great advances in these methods have improved their precision , using different multipole expansions . for a review of these issues",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the characteristic formulation of general relativity on outgoing null cones provides an interesting point of view for treating gravitationally radiating systems , since it is based on the radiation s coordinates . originally formulated by bondi _ et .",
    "_ in the 1960s @xcite , it has served as the basis for the development of recent and accurate characteristic numerical codes .",
    "these have evolved from the quasi - spherical regime , where the non - linear angular terms are neglected @xcite , to the full non - linear case @xcite . with the inclusion of ( perfect fluids ) matter sources into the numerical codes @xcite , _ post hoc _ extensions were made , putting the system of equations in terms of only first order angular derivatives @xcite .",
    "the development of the cauchy - characteristic matching ( ccm ) method @xcite allows the implementation of highly accurate gravitational wave propagation techniques .",
    "great advances in the precision for the angular derivatives were made through the introduction of a gnomonic atlas to cover the angular manifold @xcite .",
    "also , there has been impressive progress in spectral methods @xcite and in mixed methods , combining finite - difference schemes and spectral representation of the angular part of the field equations , including use of the runge - kutta 4 method to perform the time integration @xcite .",
    "+ the main purpose of such codes , after all , is to simulate the gravitational radiation patterns produced , for example , in stellar collapses or by coalescing black hole@xmath0black hole ( bh - bh ) , black hole@xmath0neutron star ( bh - ns ) or neutron star@xmath0neutron star ( ns - ns ) binary systems . as calibration tools , some toy models have been constructed from analytical solutions of the einstein field equations in the linear regime ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "+ these toy models allow one to study the boundary conditions that the metric and their derivatives should satisfy in different situations in a simple , clear and straightforward way .",
    "_ @xcite and kubeka @xcite , provide a prescription to solve analytically the field equations for the vacuum in the linear regime .",
    "then , they construct solutions for a variety of simple systems , such as a static ( dynamical ) thin shell , and a binary system composed of point particles of equal masses moving in circular orbits",
    ". however , the issue concerning the boundary conditions deserves additional studies , and most importantly , binaries of different masses in circular orbits have not been considered and therefore deserve closer scrutiny .",
    "+ therefore , the present paper generalizes a study presented in sec .",
    "iii of @xcite , which is related to binary systems .",
    "it is worth stressing that the approach considered here has been performed in a completely analytical way .",
    "the validity of this approach is supported by finding that the power lost in gravitational waves by the system agrees with the well - known result obtained by peters and mathews @xcite using a different approach .",
    "+ in the next sections , the case of a binary system composed of two point particles of different masses moving in circular orbits in a minkowski background is studied . in sec .",
    "ii , we present a brief review of the formalism , the notation used and the einstein field equations in the characteristic formulation on null cones oriented to the future . in sec .",
    "iii the specific solutions for the field equations are constructed by expanding the metric variables in terms of the @xmath1 spin - weighted spherical harmonics .",
    "a discussion on the boundary conditions satisfied by the coefficients in these expansions for arbitrary values of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes is provided . in sec .",
    "iv the gravitational radiation emitted by the binary system is computed using the bondi news function . in particular , the contribution to the gravitational radiation by the ( @xmath2 ) odd modes due to the asymmetry ( different masses ) of the system is considered , and it is shown how these terms vanish if the system is symmetric ( equal masses ) . finally , in sec .",
    "v other issues for further study are presented .",
    "the characteristic formulation based on future - oriented null cones , when the eth formalism is employed , is well known and has been used to explore a wide variety of problems @xcite . however , a brief review of some of its most important aspects is necessary to present the notation and conventions used here .",
    "we use the geometrised unit system , i.e. @xmath4 .",
    "the greek indices run from 1 to 4 , whereas the capital latin letters run from 3 to 4 , labelling the angular indices .",
    "the coordinates used are @xmath5 , where the retarded time @xmath6 labels each null cone upon which the spacetime is foliated , @xmath7 is the luminosity distance and @xmath8 represents the angular coordinates . here @xmath8 can denote @xmath9 or @xmath10 for the usual spherical coordinates or for the stereographic two patch representation , respectively . in these",
    "coordinates the bondi - sachs metric takes the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 and the redshift @xmath13 are related to the square of the adm lapse function @xcite .",
    "the shift vector between two successive null cones is labelled by @xmath14 .",
    "the metric associated with the angular manifold ( unit sphere ) is represented by @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "in addition , the bondi gauge is imposed , i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "further it is required that @xmath18 . +",
    "the metric of the unit sphere is decomposed as @xmath19 , where the overline indicates complex conjugation , the parenthesis symmetrization and the dyad @xmath20 are the null tangent vectors along the coordinate lines associated with the angular charts used to make the finite covering of the sphere .",
    "these vectors satisfy the relations : @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in stereographic",
    "coordinates the @xmath23 vectors take the form @xmath24 ( see e.g. @xcite ) whereas in spherical coordinates ( see e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath25 all tensor quantities , such as the metric or the ricci tensors , are contracting with the dyad producing spin - weighted scalars .",
    "the metric @xmath15 for the angular manifold can be represented by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and @xmath14 by @xmath28 .",
    "also , the bondi gauge constrains @xmath29 to satisfy @xmath30 .",
    "thus @xmath15 depends only on @xmath31 .",
    "it is worth stressing that the case @xmath32 returns the symmetrical unit sphere metric .",
    "+ associated with the projections of the covariant differentiation referred to @xmath16 onto the @xmath23 vectors , the differential operators , labelled @xmath33 and @xmath34 , are constructed .",
    "these operators can raise or lower the spin - weight of any spin - weighted scalar function .",
    "the spin - weighted functions are given by @xmath35 whereas @xmath33 is defined @xmath36 and @xmath37 is defined @xmath38 where the vertical line in the indices indicates covariant differentiation associated with @xmath16 , and the symbols @xmath39 and @xmath40 can take the values @xmath41 or @xmath42 and @xmath43 or @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "specifically , these operators take the following form @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "for a complete review of these operators and their properties , see @xcite .",
    "+ the einstein equations can be written as @xmath47 and in this formalism , they are decomposed as @xmath48 which corresponds to hypersurface , evolution and constraint equations , respectively @xcite .",
    "+ in the linear regime , the following set of equations corresponding to a perturbation in the minkowski background , as originally obtained by winicour @xcite and later by bishop @xcite , is given by @xmath49 [ field_eqs ]",
    "it is worth stressing that one of our aims is to study the well - known problem of a circular binary system of point particles with different masses .",
    "we show that the peters and mathews result for the power radiated in gravitational waves ( see [ appendix ] ) can be obtained by using the characteristic formulation and the news function . also , the present paper generalizes previous results @xcite applying to particles with equal masses .",
    "+ the particles held together by their mutual gravitational interaction are far enough from each other such that to first order , the interaction between them can be considered essentially newtonian .",
    "this assumption is valid if one considers the weak field approximation , in which the bondi - sachs metric in stereographic null coordinates reduces to , @xmath50 note that @xmath51 , where @xmath52 represents the newtonian potential , as usual in this kind of approximation . + we take these two particles in a minkowski background , analogously to peters and mathews @xcite and bishop _ et .",
    "al . _ in @xcite .",
    "such a system allows one to explore in full detail the boundary conditions across the hypersurfaces generated by their orbits shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "+ the density that describes the binary system is given by @xmath53where , @xmath54 are the orbital radius ( mass ) of each particle and @xmath55 .",
    "+ the orbits of the masses generate world tubes , which are extended along the retarded time coordinate , allowing the separation of the spacetime into three empty and disjoint regions : inside , between and outside the matter distribution .",
    "+ in order to solve equations - for the vacuum , the following expansion for the metric variables is used @xmath56 where @xmath57 means @xmath58 , @xmath1 are the spin - weighted spherical harmonics , which are defined in @xcite as @xmath59 and are eigenfunctions of the @xmath60 $ ] operator and @xmath61 represents the functions @xmath62 .",
    "the substitution of equation into provides a system of ordinary differential equations for the coefficients in the above expansions .",
    "the families of solutions , for @xmath63 , satisfying this system of equations for the vacuum read @xmath64 [ gen_sol_l2]where the constants of integration are represented by @xmath65 ; here @xmath66 indexes the constant and @xmath67 corresponds to the bondi metric function whose integration generated it .",
    "this set of families of solutions depends only on four constants , namely , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this is so because the families of solutions for the coefficients @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , resulting from - , are constrained by - .",
    "this fact is independent of @xmath2 , thus the set of families of solutions for any @xmath2 will have four degrees of freedom .",
    "a unique solution for the whole spacetime can not be determined by only imposing regularity of the metric variables at the null cone vertices and at the null infinity .",
    "therefore , additional boundary conditions must be imposed . in particular , this can be done by imposing boundary conditions on other hypersurfaces , such as in the case of the thin shells studied by bishop @xcite , in which the additional conditions are imposed across the world tubes generate by the shell itself .",
    "once the above constants are determined , one readily obtains the metric functions @xmath13 , @xmath31 , @xmath76 , and @xmath12 for the whole spacetime . +",
    "as divergent solutions are not expected at the vertices of the null cones , regularity conditions at these points must be imposed for the metric . in order to do so",
    ", an expansion of the metric variables around @xmath77 in power series of @xmath7 is made and the divergent terms are disregarded .",
    "this procedure establishes relationships between the coefficients , leading to a family of solutions for the interior that depends only on one undetermined parameter , where in particular @xmath78 .",
    "one obtains , for example , for @xmath63 , @xmath79 for the intermediate region , the same structure of the general solutions is maintained , for the case @xmath63 given by - .",
    "that is so because there is no reason to discard any particular term , or to establish any relationship between the constants as occurs for the interior region .",
    "for the exterior region , since that is required regularity at the null infinity , the coefficient of the exponential factor @xmath80 must be null .",
    "this means that all constants of the form @xmath81 , with @xmath82 , must be zero .",
    "therefore , the number of degrees of freedom for the exterior family of solutions is reduced in one parameter .",
    "thus , a family of solutions to describe the whole spacetime for the field equations - , with eight parameters to be determined is obtained .",
    "now , in order to fix these eight constants , it is necessary to impose additional boundary conditions , in particular across the time - like world tubes generated by the orbits of the particles .",

    "+ figure [ metric_functions ] shows some of the coefficients of the expansion of the metric variables in terms of the compactified coordinate @xmath121 for @xmath127 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     as expected , the metric functions @xmath13 and @xmath12 and the first derivatives of @xmath31 and @xmath76 show jumps at @xmath128 and @xmath129 , which are just the positions of the masses , in agreement with the boundary conditions initially imposed . + note that since the first field equation for the vacuum @xmath130 implies that @xmath107 are constants along @xmath7 , as sketched in , and that @xmath13 is a gauge term for the gravitational potential , then , @xmath131 can be redefined as @xmath132 .",
    "these facts make the choice of the frequency @xmath133 as obeying kepler s third law completely consistent and natural .",
    "now , we proceed with the calculation of the power emitted by the binary system via gravitational wave emission . we show that the approach presented here is consistent with the well - known result obtained by peters and mathews @xcite .",
    "+ following bishop @xcite , the bondi news function in the weak field approximation is given by , @xmath134 substituting the metric variables given in , one obtains the news function for @xmath135 and @xmath136 , namely @xmath137 now , substituting the coefficients of the metric variables for the exterior region , one obtains @xmath138 where we define the spin 2 quantity @xmath139 as @xmath140 since the binary system is confined to a plane , then a natural choice to simplify the problem of expressing the news function , without loss of generality , is to put the masses motion in the equatorial plane @xmath141 .",
    "this means symmetry of reflection for the density of matter and , consequently , for the spacetime .",
    "thus , this choice restricts the components of the density , obtained from , to have the following form @xmath142 \\tilde{\\rho}_{lm } \\frac{m_1   r_2 ^ 2 \\delta \\left(r - r_1 \\right)-m_2   r_1 ^ 2 \\delta \\left(r - r_2      \\right)}{r_1 ^ 2 r_2 ^ 2 } &",

    "thus , as expected , one obtains immediately @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the physical velocity of the identical masses , which is obviously tangent to the circular orbit .",
    "+ the energy lost by the system @xmath152 is related to the news function , via @xmath153 which results for @xmath154 in @xmath155 notice that the first term on the right side of the above equation is identical to the power lost obtained by peters and mathews @xcite for circular orbits , whereas the other terms stand for the octupole , hexadecapole , etc .",
    "in this study we generalize a previous work by bishop _ et .",
    "@xcite , concerning equal mass binary systems in a minkowski background . here",
    "we consider the case in which the components of the binary systems have different masses , although still in circular orbits .",
    "+ we show that , instead of two regions , as in the case of binaries with equal components , the spacetime needs now to be separated in three regions : interior , between and outside the two world tubes . as a result",
    ", the match conditions satisfied by the coefficients in the spin - weighted spherical harmonics expansion , across the two hypersurfaces generated by the circular orbits of these two ( different ) masses were generalized .",
    "also , the procedure developed here allows one to perform calculations for arbitrary values of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes .",
    "+ it is worth stressing that one of the interesting aspects of the present study has do with the development of a procedure that can be applied in problems in which multiple layers are present .",
    "+ we also calculate the energy lost by the emission of gravitational waves by means of the bondi news function .",
    "again , we do that for arbitrary multipoles , in other words , for different values of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes .",
    "the interesting point here is that for different masses the emission of gravitational radiation occurs for all values ( multipoles ) of @xmath135 ; for the particular case of binary systems with equal components , the multipole terms for odd values of @xmath2 vanish .",
    "+ last , but not least , the present study can be used as a method to extract gravitational radiation of binary systems during their periodic phase , when one considers that the system can be surrounded by a boundary , @xmath156 , very far from the system , where a linear approximation can be applied .",

    "we would also like to thank the referees ( dr . casey handmer and an anonymous ) for their helpful comments and suggestions .",
