    "one of the most exciting discoveries in elementary particle physics among the latest 20 years is neutrino oscillation@xcite , which leads to massive neutrinos and large neutrino mixing angles .",
    "interestingly , this discovery gives an evidence of grand unified theory ( gut)@xcite , in which unification of forces and unification of quarks and leptons are realized .",
    "this evidence for unification of quarks and leptons makes the idea of gut quite promising , because for unification of forces we have already known an experimental evidence that three gauge couplings meet at a scale , the gut scale @xmath5@xcite , especially in supersymmetric ( susy ) gut@xcite .",
    "moreover , the large neutrino mixing angles imply not only large mixing angles of doublet lepton @xmath6 but also those of right - handed down quark @xmath7 in @xmath1 gut because @xmath0 field of @xmath1 contains @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this suggests an interesting possibility that the flavor changing processes are seen in nucleon decay which is the most important prediction of gut . in this paper",
    ", we study the flavor changing nucleon decay and propose that the flavor changing nucleon decay can be a key observation for gut .",
    "first , we explain the qualitative evidence for the unification of matters . in @xmath1 gut ,",
    "yukawa interactions with higgs fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 are given by @xmath10 where @xmath2 fields contain doublet quark @xmath11 , right - handed up quark @xmath12 , and right - handed charged lepton @xmath13 , and the last term can be obtained from @xmath14 by integrating the right - handed neutrino fields @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the index for generation , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are yukawa matrix of up type quarks , that of down type quarks and charged leptons , dirac neutrino yukawa matrix , and right - handed neutrino mass matrix , respectively .",
    "these unified structures for yukawa interactions are corresponding to the classification of the hierarchies of the observed quark and lepton masses that up type quark masses have the strongest hierarchy , neutrino masses have the weakest , and down type quark and charged lepton masses have middle hierarchies if neutrino mass hierarchy is normal ( not inverted ) .",
    "moreover , if we assume that @xmath2 fields induce stronger hierarchy in yukawa couplings than @xmath0 fields , these various hierarchies for quark and lepton masses can be explained .",
    "furthermore , this assumption explains that quark mixings are smaller than lepton mixings at the same time if we use a reasonable expectation that the stronger hierarchy leads to smaller mixings .",
    "this brilliant chemistry between the yukawa structure in @xmath1 gut and the observed hierarchies of quark and lepton masses and mixings is quite non - trivial , and therefore it can be regarded as an experimental signature for unification of quarks and leptons in @xmath1 gut .",
    "@xmath4 gut@xcite is more attractive because the assumption in the @xmath1 gut can be derived , and as a result , various yukawa matrices can be derived from one basic yukawa hierarchy@xcite .",
    "the fundamental representation in @xmath4 is divided into @xmath21 representations as @xmath22 this @xmath23 includes one generation quarks and leptons in addition to one pair of vector - like fields @xmath24 and a singlet . if we introduce three @xmath25 ( @xmath16 ) for three generation quarks and leptons , we have six @xmath0 fields .",
    "three of six @xmath0 fields become superheavy after developing the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of @xmath26 and @xmath27 through the yukawa interactions @xmath28 where the vev of @xmath29 breaks @xmath4 into @xmath3 and the vev of @xmath27 breaks @xmath3 into @xmath1 .",
    "once we fix @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 mass matrix of three @xmath35s and six @xmath0s is determined , and therefore , three massless modes @xmath36 are fixed . here",
    "we assume that these yukawa couplings @xmath30 and @xmath31 have strong hierarchy corresponding to the hierarchy of @xmath37 of @xmath1 .",
    "typically , we take @xmath38 where a unit of hierarchy @xmath39 is taken to be around the cabibbo mixing to obtain cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix@xcite . the @xmath40 coefficients are omitted usually in this paper .",
    "then , two @xmath41 fields from @xmath42 become superheavy unless @xmath43 because they have larger yukawa couplings and therefore have larger mass parameters .",
    "the three massless modes @xmath44 come from the first two generation fields @xmath45 and @xmath46 which have smaller yukawa couplings . as a result , three @xmath44 , whose main modes typically become @xmath47 , induce milder yukawa hierarchy than @xmath48 fields , that is nothing but what we assume in the @xmath1 gut to obtain realistic hierarchies of quark and lepton masses and mixings . note that @xmath49 has yukawa couplings through the mixing with @xmath50 when the higgs @xmath8 and @xmath9 are included in @xmath51 of @xmath3 in @xmath26",
    ". then we can obtain realistic yukawa hierarchies as @xmath52 when @xmath53 .",
    "the right - handed neutrino masses are obtained from @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the cutoff scale , after developing the vevs @xmath57 and @xmath57 .",
    "here we take @xmath58 .",
    "all quark and lepton mass matrices can be diagonalized by unitary matrices for @xmath37 fields and @xmath41 fields @xmath59 and we can obtain realistic ckm matrix @xmath60 and the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix@xcite @xmath61 , when @xmath53 .",
    "note that the important prediction @xmath62 , which was confirmed by recent neutrino experiments as @xmath63@xcite , is caused by @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , to obtain the realistic hierarchies of quark and lepton masses and mixings , it is essential that the @xmath65 , which comes from @xmath2 of @xmath3 , becomes the second generation @xmath0 field @xmath66 .",
    "that structure is important to study of the prediction of the nucleon decay in the next section .",
    "note that the relation @xmath67 can be realized even in @xmath3 unification , if @xmath2 of @xmath3 , which provides @xmath68 , is introduced as a matter field@xcite .",
    "therefore , we have three gut models which satisfy the yukawa hierarchy hypothesis , `` @xmath37 fields induce stronger hierarchy in yukawa couplings than @xmath0 fields '' .",
    "their unification groups are @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "next , we study how to identify these unification group by observing various partial nucleon decay widths .",
    "in this paper , we concentrate on the nucleon decay via dimension 6 operators@xcite , because the nucleon decay via dimension 5 operators@xcite is strongly dependent on the explicit model of gut higgs sector which is expected to have big modification to solve the most difficult problem called the doublet - triplet splitting problem@xcite and because it is strongly suppressed in natural gut in which the difficult problem is solved with natural assumption@xcite .",
    "the dimension 6 effective operators which induce nucleon decay in @xmath4 gut are produced via mediation by @xmath1 superheavy gauge boson @xmath69 , @xmath3 superheavy gauge boson @xmath70 , and @xmath4 superheavy gauge boson @xmath71 as@xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the unified gauge coupling and the superheavy gauge boson masses @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are dependent on the vevs of the gut higgs which break @xmath4 into the sm gauge group . here , large character denotes @xmath68 field which comes from @xmath2 of @xmath3 . in the @xmath3 gut ,",
    "we just take @xmath77 , and in @xmath1 gut , we take @xmath78 and neglect the interactions which include the large character fields . note that the nucleon decay via dimension 6 operators depends on yukawa couplings , although this is via gauge interactions .",
    "the situation is similar to the weak interaction .",
    "the weak interaction is also the gauge interaction , but we have ckm mixings which are determined by yukawa couplings . for the nucleon decay , the nucleon decay via dimension 6",
    "operators depends on the diagonalizing matrices for yukawa matrices .",
    "however , we have already understood the mixings in gut as the qualitative evidence for the @xmath1 gut . especially for the diagonalizing matrices , @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    "are fixed as ckm matrix and mns matrix , respectively , except @xmath40 coefficients .",
    "therefore , these ambiguities are almost fixed by our understanding of yukawa structures .",
    "therefore , we can compare the predictions of nucleon decays in @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 guts .",
    "important observation to find useful nucleon decay modes for identification of unification group is that all four fermions in the first term in eq .",
    "( [ dim6 ] ) come from @xmath2 of @xmath1 fields , and in the other terms two of four fermions come from @xmath0 fields .",
    "since @xmath70 and @xmath71 gauge interactions induce only the effective interactions with @xmath0 fields , we should look for the nucleon decay modes in which the operators with @xmath41 fields are significant to identify the unification group .",
    "since all operators with @xmath41 fields include a lepton doublet while @xmath37 field includes no neutrino , the modes with neutrino can be important to identify the unification group .",
    "the decay mode @xmath81 has been studied in the literature for the identification@xcite . especially in ref@xcite , we have shown that two ratios @xmath82 and @xmath83 are useful to identify three unification group as in fig .",
    "[ fig : r1r2 ] , where we have @xmath84 model points for each unification group @xmath1(black points ) , @xmath3(red points ) , and @xmath4(blue points ) and the magnitudes of the @xmath40 coefficients of diagonalizing matrices are determined randomly between 0.5 and 2 .",
    "we adopt superheavy gauge boson masses @xmath85 as in the previous paper@xcite .",
    "( and @xmath86 for @xmath1 ) , which are adopted in ref .",
    "theoretically we can fix those diagonalizing matrices without loss of generality .",
    "if we have not imposed any constraints to the other diagonalizing matrices , it would not produce any changes in the results .",
    "however , in our analysis , we constrained the @xmath40 coefficients of the other diagonalizing matrices , and therefore , the results depends on whether these conditions are imposed or not .",
    "we think that the results without these conditions become similar to the results with these conditions with wider allowed range for the @xmath40 coefficients .",
    "therefore , distributions of model points have become wider in this paper than in the previous one .",
    "] in the calculations in this paper , we use the hadron matrix elements calculated by lattice@xcite , and the renormalization factors of the minimal susy @xmath1 gut as @xmath87 for the operators which include a right - handed charged lepton @xmath13 and @xmath88 for the operators which include the doublet leptons @xmath6 as the reference values@xcite .",
    "model points for @xmath1(black ) , @xmath3(red ) , and @xmath4(blue ) guts with horizontal axis @xmath89 and vertical axis @xmath90 .",
    "the superheavy gauge boson masses are taken to be @xmath85 . ]",
    "the ratio @xmath91 is sensitive to flavor structure of the second generation , and very useful to identify @xmath3 and @xmath4 unification group .",
    "interestingly , @xmath92 can be larger than one especially for higher rank unification group like @xmath4 .",
    "of course the results are strongly dependent on the mass spectrum of superheavy gauge bosons .",
    "if @xmath93 , the @xmath4 model points shrink to @xmath3 model points , and when @xmath75 becomes much larger than @xmath74 , the @xmath3 model points shrink to the @xmath1 model points .",
    "however , we can say that if @xmath94 , @xmath1 is implausible and if @xmath95 , @xmath4 is preferable . unfortunately , the detection efficiency for the mode @xmath96 is not so high as @xmath97 mode@xcite , and therefore , it requires extremely more powerful experiments to observe the mode @xmath96 even if @xmath95 .    in this paper , we propose novel modes which may be useful for the identification of unification group .",
    "essential point is that @xmath0 fields have large mixings in diagonalizing matrices while @xmath2 fields have small mixings . and",
    "therefore , flavor changing nucleon decay , for example , @xmath98 or @xmath99 , becomes more important for higher rank unification group . in figs .",
    "[ fig : r1r3 ] and [ fig : r1r4 ] , we have calculated the two ratios @xmath100 and @xmath101 with horizontal axis @xmath92 in @xmath84 model points of @xmath1(black ) , @xmath3(red ) , and @xmath4(blue ) guts with the superheavy gauge boson masses @xmath102 .",

    "interestingly , the @xmath1 model points are clearly separated from @xmath3 and @xmath4 model points in fig . [",
    "fig : r1r3 ] , while fig .",
    "[ fig : r1r2 ] has no such separation .",
    "one more interesting point is that there are a lot of model points with @xmath104 .",
    "since the detection efficiency of the @xmath98 is as large as that of @xmath105@xcite , the flavor changing nucleon decay mode @xmath98 can be found earlier than @xmath97 if @xmath104 . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath106 is comparatively smaller , mainly because the mode @xmath107 has the phase space suppression and smaller hadron matrix elements .",
    "note that there is a tendency to obtain larger @xmath92 for larger @xmath108 .",
    "although it may not be so clear in these figures , gut with larger rank unification group predicts larger fcnd .",
    "actually , it is seen in concrete numbers of model points with @xmath104 ( 17% in @xmath4 , 0.7% in @xmath3 and 0.5% in @xmath1 .",
    "it must be useful to stress the advantage of the neutrino modes like @xmath96 for identification of unification group , although such modes have disadvantage for the detection .",
    "the most important feature for @xmath109 is that the value becomes larger for gut with larger rank unification group , especially when @xmath2 fields have small mixings . actually , when @xmath110",
    ", we can show that @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "here we have summed the flavor of neutrinos , that is important in this calculation . obviously @xmath92 becomes larger for larger unification group .",
    "this feature is quite important to identify the unification group .",
    "recently , two events have been found in the signal region for the process @xmath98@xcite , though these are still consistent with the background expected to be 0.9 event mainly from atmospheric neutrino events . if the signature for the flavor changing nucleon decay @xmath98 has been found in superkamiokande , higher rank unification group like @xmath3 or @xmath4 is preferable when the mixings of @xmath2 fields are small . the predicted partial lifetime for @xmath114 gev",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : lifetime ] .",
    "model points for @xmath1 ( black ) , @xmath3 ( red ) , and @xmath4 ( blue ) guts with @xmath114 gev .",
    "horizontal axis is @xmath103 and vertical axis is partial lifetime for @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which are proportional to @xmath115 .",
    "the superheavy gauge boson masses are taken to be @xmath85 . ]    obviously , for larger @xmath108 , longer partial lifetime for @xmath97 and shorter partial lifetime for @xmath98 are obtained . in @xmath1 ,",
    "both partial lifetimes become longer than in @xmath3 and @xmath4 . if the signature is from the real nucleon decay process , it is obvious that the usual mssm predicted value @xmath116 is too large to explain the events even if the ambiguities in hadron matrix elements@xcite are taken into account . therefore , to explain the signal , larger unification gauge coupling @xmath117 ( it requires extra vector - like fields in addition to the mssm fields",
    ". ) , and/or smaller superheavy gauge boson mass @xmath74 are required .",
    "note that both features are predicted in the natural gut @xcite , in which the nucleon decay via dimension 6 operators is enhanced while that via dimension 5 is suppressed .",
    "which mode will be found next ?",
    "we expect that @xmath109 can be larger than @xmath118 , since @xmath108 is positively correlated with @xmath92 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : r1r3 ] .",
    "however , since the detection efficiency for the mode @xmath96 is much smaller than that for @xmath97 , we can predict that next mode should be @xmath105 .",
    "of course , the other modes , @xmath96 and @xmath119 , are expected to be found in future experiments like hyperkamiokande @xcite .",
    "the observation of these modes is quite important and gives us critical hints for studying gut models .    in this paper , we have emphasized the importance of flavor changing nucleon decay , whose observation may identify the unification group .",
    "especially , the mode @xmath98 is important because the detection efficiency is as large as the usual mode @xmath97 .",
    "the partial lifetime of @xmath98 can be shorter than that of @xmath97 especially in @xmath4 gut .",
    "although most of model points predict longer partial lifetime of @xmath98 than that of @xmath97 , it is important to pay attention to the mode @xmath98 even if the present signal for @xmath98 is from the back ground processes .",
