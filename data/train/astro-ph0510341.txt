    "the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) has built three multi - kilometer interferometers , designed to search for gravitational waves ( gws ) .",
    "one of the possible targets of such a search is the stochastic background of gravitational waves .",
    "many possible sources of such a background have been proposed ( see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "some of these sources are astrophysical in nature , such as rotating neutron stars , supernovae or low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "others are cosmological , such as the amplification of quantum vacuum fluctuations during inflation  @xcite , phase transitions  @xcite , and cosmic strings  @xcite .",
    "most of these sources are expected to be very weak and below the sensitivity of the ligo interferometers .",
    "furthermore , they are constrained by several observations .",
    "the measurement of the cosmic microwave background by the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) bounds the logarithmic spectrum of gravitational waves here should not be confused with the ratio of the total energy density stored in gravitational waves and the critical density of the universe , i.e. , @xmath1 .",
    "the quantity @xmath2 is the so - called gw spectrum per unit log of frequency : @xmath3 .",
    "it would have been more appropriate to denote the gw spectrum by @xmath4 and not @xmath2 . ] to @xmath5 at @xmath6 hz  @xcite , where @xmath7 is the `` reduced '' hubble parameter @xcite . since in standard ( slow - roll ) inflationary models , the spectrum produced by the parametric amplification of quantum - vacuum fluctuations  @xcite is expected to be ( almost ) flat at higher frequencies  @xcite , a similar bound applies at higher frequencies , as well . in some inflationary models in which a cosmological phase with equation of state stiffer than radiation comes before the radiation era , the spectrum at high frequency could increase as function of frequency , thus avoiding the cobe bound .",
    "for example this happens in quintessential inflation  @xcite .",
    "the gw spectrum could mildly increase as function of frequency in scenarios in which inflation occurs with an equation of state @xmath8  @xcite  some examples are given in ref .",
    "@xcite where inflation is obtained from a non - canonical lagrangian .",
    "in other scenarios of superstring cosmology , as the cyclic / ekpyrotic models  @xcite , the gw spectrum also increases as function of frequency , but its normalization makes it unobservable by ground- and space - based detectors .",
    "the arrival times of the millisecond pulsars can be used to place a bound at @xmath9 hz  @xcite : @xmath10 .",
    "doppler tracking of the cassini spacecraft can be used to arrive at yet another bound , in the @xmath11 hz band @xcite : @xmath12 . the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) model and observations can be used to constrain the integral of the gw spectrum @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "finally , the ground - based interferometers and resonant bars can probe the spectrum of gravitational waves in the band 10 hz - few khz .",
    "the most recent bound from ligo is @xmath14 for a flat spectrum in the 69 - 156 hz band  @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the implications of the recent ligo result on pre - big - bang ( pbb ) models @xcite , and we investigate their accessibility to future ligo searches .",
    "the pbb models predict a stochastic gw spectrum whose amplitude can increase as a function of frequency in some frequency ranges .",
    "hence , they can avoid the bounds due to the cmb , pulsar timing , and doppler tracking , and predict relatively large background in the frequency band where ligo is sensitive . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the gw spectrum in the minimal pbb models . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the latest result from the ligo search for the stochastic gw background . in sec .",
    "iv we study how the new ligo results , and the expected future results , constrain the free parameters of the minimal pbb models .",
    "in sec . v we discuss how modifications of the minimal pbb model can affect the observability of the stochastic gw background . finally , we conclude in sec . vi .",
    "in the pbb scenario ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , the initial state of the universe is assumed to be the string perturbative vacuum , where the universe can be described by the low - energy string effective action .",
    "the kinetic energy of the dilaton field drives the universe through an inflationary evolution ( henceforth denoted dilaton inflationary phase ) , which is an accelerated expansion in the string frame , or accelerated contraction ( gravitational collapse ) in the ( usual ) einstein frame .",
    "the spacetime curvature increases in the dilaton inflationary phase , eventually reaching the order of the string scale .",
    "at this point , the low - energy string effective action is no longer an accurate description of the universe , and higher order corrections ( higher - curvature and/or quantum - loop corrections ) should be included in the string action .",
    "these corrections are expected to reduce or stop the growth of the curvature , _ removing _ the would - be big - bang singularity .",
    "the exact evolution of the universe in this high curvature and/or strong - coupling phase ( henceforth denoted by _",
    "stringy _ phase ) is currently not known  @xcite .",
    "the end of the stringy phase is what one could refer to as the `` big - bang ''  the universe s transition into the radiation phase , which is then followed by the matter - dominated and acceleration - dominated phases .",
    "although the transition between the inflationary pbb phase and the post - big - bang phase is not well understood , some models have been proposed in the literature which can partially describe it . in the following ,",
    "we focus on the model derived in ref .",
    "@xcite where , in the string frame , the dilaton - inflationary phase is followed by a phase of constant curvature with the dilaton field growing linearly in time .",
    "it is then assumed that at the end of this stringy phase the dilaton reaches the present vacuum expectation value and stops .",
    "this model has been denoted in the literature as the `` minimal '' pbb model . within this model",
    ", the stochastic gw background has been evaluated  @xcite . for simplicity , in this paper",
    "we use the result for the logarithmic spectrum of gravitational waves  @xcite as evaluated in ref .",

    "this is the largest frequency ( smallest scale ) for which fluctuations are amplified  hence , @xmath25 is also the high - frequency cut - off of the gw spectrum .",
    "thus , the gw spectrum in the minimal pbb scenario increases as @xmath26 for @xmath27 , goes as @xmath28 for @xmath29 , and vanishes exponentially for @xmath30 .",
    "an example of such a spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , and we reproduce it in fig .",
    "[ example ] .     vs @xmath31 , as predicted by the pbb model with @xmath32 hz , @xmath33 hz , and @xmath34.,width=316 ]    let us now focus on the free parameters of the model .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is , by definition , limited to positive values .",
    "we will only consider the case @xmath35  for @xmath36 the decreasing spectrum would easily violate the existing experimental bounds  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 varies over the range @xmath37 .",
    "since the spectrum sharply decreases for frequencies below @xmath21 , ligo s reach for models where @xmath21 is above the ligo band quickly diminishes . in particular , to avoid the @xmath26 dependence in the ligo frequency band , @xmath38 hz is necessary .",
    "furthermore , eq .  ( [ highfreq ] ) shows that in the high - frequency limit the spectrum does not depend on @xmath21 .",
    "hence , if @xmath39 hz , it does not matter what it is , as far as the accessibility to ligo is concerned .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath25 can be approximated as @xcite  : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the ( constant ) hubble parameter during the stringy phase , @xmath42 is the time when the string phase ends , and @xmath43 is the string length .",
    "the values @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the most natural ones  @xcite  , was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by assuming @xmath46 and @xmath47 with @xmath48 . ]",
    "but they might vary by an order of magnitude . since @xmath49",
    "[ see eq .",

    "finally , it can be shown that the optimal filter can be written in the form @xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the overlap reduction function ( arising from the different locations and orientations of the two interferometers ) , and @xmath64 is the template spectrum to be searched . assuming the template spectrum @xmath65 , the normalization constant @xmath66 can be chosen such that @xmath67 .",
    "this analysis procedure was implemented in the recent analysis of the ligo data , using the 4 km interferometers at hanford , wa and livingston , la , for the science run s3 @xcite .",

    "previous investigations , which did not use real data , were done in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as discussed in section 2 , the amplitude of the gw spectrum in the pbb models is proportional to @xmath26 at frequencies below @xmath21 .",
    "hence , the sensitivity of ligo to pbb models decreases as @xmath21 is increased . to avoid the @xmath26 dependence of the spectrum in the ligo frequency band , we choose @xmath73 hz . for such choice of @xmath21 , the ligo band falls in the relatively flat part of the gw spectrum .",

    ", we evaluate @xmath80 predicted by the model , and we check whether it is excluded by the experimental ( or future expected ) results .",

    "as @xmath22 decreases from 1.5 , the spectral slope increases , and the spectrum in the ligo band drops quickly below ligo sensitivity .",
    "although the bbn bound also weakens for @xmath84 , the effect is not as dramatic because this bound is placed on the integral of the spectrum over a large frequency range .",

    "in this section we investigate how extensions of the minimal pbb model or variations of it can impact the accessibility of the stochastic gw background to ligo and to advanced ligo .",
    "the gw spectrum in the minimal pbb model was originally evaluated  @xcite neglecting the higher - curvature corrections in the equation of tensorial fluctuations during the stringy phase .",
    "gasperini  @xcite evaluated the higher - order equation for tensorial fluctuations and showed that these corrections modify the amplitude of the perturbation _ only _ by a factor of order one .",
    "hence , these corrections are not expected to affect our results significantly .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors have examined the effect of radiation production via some reheating process occuring below the string scale . such a process may be needed to dilute several relic particles produced during ( or at the very end of ) the pbb phase , whose abundance could spoil the bbn predictions  @xcite .",
    "depending on when and for how long the entropy production occurs , it can change both the shape and the amplitude of the gw spectrum in the frequency region around @xmath105 hz .",
    "in general , the amplitude of the spectrum at these frequencies is reduced .",
    "if we assume that the reheating process occurs at the end of the stringy phase ( i.e. , all of the entropy is produced at the end of the stringy phase ) , then the effect of the process is a simple scaling of the original spectrum by the factor @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the fraction of the present thermal entropy density that was produced in the process .",
    "[ fsmuds ] shows the exclusion curves in the @xmath108 plane for @xmath109 . by comparing to fig .",
    "[ fsmu ] , we can see that the effect weakens all bounds .",
    "plane for @xmath110 hz and for @xmath111 ( the excluded regions are to the right of the corresponding curves ) .",
    "we show the latest result from ligo , and the future expected reach of ligo and of advanced ligo .",
    "the indirect bbn limit excludes all models shown in this plane.,width=316 ]    another possible , but somewhat arbitrary variation of the model , was examined by allen and brustein  @xcite .",
    "they assumed that stochastic gravitational waves are not produced during the stringy phase , but only during the dilaton phase .",
    "this is achieved by setting @xmath112 and assuming that @xmath2 vanishes for @xmath113 .",
    "such a model is not well motivated in the pbb scenario , but it is phenomenologically interesting as it represents a class of models whose spectrum peaks in the ligo band .",
    "the spectrum of this model can , therefore , be approximated by : @xmath114 the bbn bound becomes weaker because the integral in eq .",
    "( [ bbnlimit ] ) is performed over a much smaller frequency range , and it can be written as @xmath115 .",
    "[ ab ] shows the bound from the latest ligo result as a function of @xmath21 .",

    "@xcite , it is well possible that many more cosmological phases are present between the pre- and the post - big - bang eras  some examples are given in refs .",
    "if this is the case , the gw spectra during the high - curvature and/or strong coupling region will be characterized by several branches with increasing and decreasing slopes . due to the dependence of the spectra on a larger number of parameters",
    ", it would be more difficult to constrain these non - minimal scenarios , even when ligo overcomes the bbn bound .",
    "using the most recent ligo search for the stochastic gravitational background  @xcite , we determined the exclusion regions in the parameter space of the pbb minimal model  @xcite .",
    "we found that the most recent s3 run can access the stochastic gw background only if @xmath25 is larger than the most natural value @xmath117 ( i.e. only if @xmath118 hz ; see fig .",

    "[ fsmu ] ) . a one - year run of ligo at the design sensitivity will be able to start excluding regions with sligthly increasing gw spectrum ( as a function of frequency ) , while advanced ligo could exclude spectra with slopes of at most @xmath122 .",

    "[ f1mu ] , the bbn bound already _ excludes _ all models accessible to the ligo s3 run .",

    "similarly , as shown in fig .",

    "<S> the recent search for a stochastic background of gravitational waves with ligo interferometers has produced a new upper bound on the amplitude of this background in the 100 hz region . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the implications of the current and future ligo results on pre - big - bang models of the early universe , determining the exclusion regions in the parameter space of the minimal pre - big bang scenario . </S>",
    "<S> although the current ligo reach is still weaker than the indirect bound from big - bang nucleosynthesis , future runs by ligo , in the coming year , and by advanced ligo ( @xmath02009 ) should further constrain the parameter space , and in some parts surpass the big - bang nucleosynthesis bound . </S>",
    "<S> it will be more difficult to constrain the parameter space in non - minimal pre - big - bang models , which are characterized by multiple cosmological phases in the yet not well understood stringy phase , and where the higher - order curvature and/or quantum - loop corrections in the string effective action should be included . </S>"
