    "we study elementary excitations of the generalized @xmath0 spin ladder model ( equivalent to a single zigzag spin chain with alternation and frustration ) .",
    "the model is described by the hamiltonian ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gen - ladder ] ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 determines the strength of the next - nearest neighbor interaction , and @xmath5 corresponds to alternation of the nearest - neighbor exchange , whose strength is set to be unity .",
    "this model has rich behavior depending on the values of parameters @xmath6 and @xmath5 , and its phase diagram ( see fig . [",
    "fig : phasediag ] ) is rather well understood @xcite ( at least for the half - plane @xmath4 ; for negative @xmath6 the situation is less clear @xcite ) . without loss of generality",
    ", we will assume that @xmath7 , since there is an obvious symmetry transformation@xcite relating the half - plane @xmath8 with the strip @xmath9 .",
    "the `` symmetry line '' @xmath10 is peculiar because it is the line of transition between dimerized phases with different signs of the dimer order . within the interval @xmath11",
    "this transition is of the second order , the ground state is unique and nondimerized , and the corresponding spectra are gapless ; on the other part of this line the transition is of the first order , so that for @xmath12 , @xmath10 there are two degenerate dimerized ground states , and the system is gapped .",
    "the transition at @xmath13 is well studied , see ref .   for a review . everywhere except at the symmetry line the model ( [ ham ] ) has unique ground state with a finite gap above it . in the limit",
    "@xmath14 the diagonal spins form effective @xmath1 units , and the system becomes equivalent to the @xmath1 haldane chain , with the effective coupling constant @xmath15 .",
    "elementary excitations of the generalized ladder , however , have been studied to much less extent than its ground state properties .",
    "the heisenberg point ( @xmath16 , @xmath10 ) is exactly solvable by means of the bethe ansatz technique , and the elementary excitations are pairs of noninteracting @xmath0 entities ( `` spinons '' ) .",
    "@xcite the ground state contains the fermi sea of spinons , and the excitations are of the particle - hole type .",
    "it is also known that at the so - called majumdar - ghosh ( mg ) point ( @xmath10 , @xmath17 ) , where the exact ( twofold degenerate ) ground state is a simple product of singlet dimers , @xcite the elementary excitation can be approximately constructed as a pair of unbound spins above the completely dimerized state . @xcite the elementary excitation is composed of two @xmath0 entities which are kinks in the dimer order and resemble spinons in that they are `` almost free '' ( i.e. , form scattering states for most values of momenta ) in case of unbroken translational invariance .",
    "when nonzero alternation is present , one may expect that those `` spinons '' are confined into a single @xmath1 particle .",
    "in the haldane limit ( infinite alternation ) the system has long - range hidden ( string ) order,@xcite and the elementary excitation is known @xcite to be a soliton in the string order .",
    "the concept of string order was generalized to spin ladders @xcite and it was shown that several ladder models exhibit long - range generalized string correlations .",
    "@xcite it was argued @xcite that the gapped phase of the spin ladder is the same as the haldane phase of the effective @xmath1 chain .",
    "we construct the variational ansatz for the wave function of the elementary excitation in the form of a matrix product , using the recently proposed @xcite matrix - product - states approach to the description of the ground state properties of spin ladders . the ground state in this approach",
    "has a built - in generalized string order , and we construct the excitation as the @xmath1 composite particle being a kink in the string order and consisting of two bound @xmath0 entities .",
    "the wave function of the kink pair contains only one variational parameter @xmath18 having the meaning of the average pair size ( the localization length ) .",
    "we show that at the mg point @xmath18 is infinite and our ansatz reduces to that of shastry and sutherland ; @xcite when moving away from the mg point , @xmath18 drops down very quickly to the value of about a few lattice constants . at the `` regular '' ladder point ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) the dispersion relation",
    "as obtained from our ansatz agrees well with the results of other authors using different technics ( see ref . and references therein ) . in the haldane limit @xmath18 goes to zero , and our wave function transforms into the `` crackion '' ansatz introduced by fth and slyom @xcite ( see also ref .  ) for the description of the haldane triplet in the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) model .",
    "we compare our variational results with the numerical data obtained through the exact diagonalization of a finite ( 24 spins ) ladder system , and find a reasonable agreement between the two approaches .",
    "we conclude that our simple variational ansatz allows us to study analytically at a qualitative level the crossover from free to strongly bound spinons , giving a reasonably good description in a wide range of physical models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : ansatz ] we introduce our ansatz for the elementary excitation . in section [ sec : results ] we present results from the variational calculation in comparison with numerical data .",
    "the elementary excitations in different regions of the phase diagram are discussed .",
    "finally , sect.[sec : summary ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "recently , @xcite a variational wave function for the description of the ground state properties of generalized spin ladders was proposed in the form of a matrix - product ( mp ) state .",
    "the mp representation was first discussed by fannes _",
    "@xcite in an abstract manner and later by klmper _",
    "et al._@xcite for the @xmath1 deformed vbs chain , and has found since then numerous applications in exact and variational calculations @xcite . for periodic boundary conditions , the trial wave function for the ground state of the ladder consisting of @xmath21 spins can be written as @xmath22 here the elementary matrix @xmath23 is constructed from the singlet state @xmath24 and three triplet states @xmath25 of the ladder diagonals ; @xmath26 are the pauli matrices in a spherical basis , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 in case of absence of external magnetic field can be chosen real and satisfy the normalization condition @xmath31 .",
    "the wave function ( [ mp ] ) has the following remarkable properties : @xcite ( i ) for arbitrary @xmath29 and @xmath30 it is a global singlet ( see also ref .   for details ) ; ( ii ) it has a built - in generalized string order defined as `` diluted antiferromagnetic order '' : @xmath32 and @xmath33 should occur in perfect antiferromagnetic sequence , arbitrarily diluted by @xmath34 s and @xmath35 s ; ( iii ) both degenerate dimer ground states at the majumdar - ghosh point can be written in the above form , as well as the `` valence - bond '' aklt state @xcite which approximates the ground state in the effective @xmath1 haldane limit .",
    "the two dimer ground states at the mg point correspond to @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively , and the aklt state corresponds to zero singlet weight ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) .",
    "the state ( [ mp ] ) has very short - ranged correlations and therefore can not be considered as a good approximation in the gapless region of the phase diagram ; we will thus restrict ourselves to the study of the gapped phase only .",
    "the variational energy @xmath41 calculated with the trial function ( [ mp ] ) has at most two minima as a function of @xmath42 : one is always located at @xmath36 , @xmath37 and corresponds to singlets on the diagonal links , and the position of the other minimum @xmath43 depends on @xmath6 and @xmath5 ; this latter minimum is absent in certain region of the phase diagram .",
    "the two minima have equal energies only at the mg point , and for any other choice of the model parameters they are inequivalent.@xcite    we construct the trial wave function for the elementary excitation , requiring the following : ( i ) it should be a triplet ; ( ii ) it should be a soliton in the generalized string order as defined above ; ( iii ) it should be able to reproduce the ansatz of shastry and sutherland for the mg point , @xcite i.e.  a pair of unbound spins connecting two degenerate dimer ground states , and the `` crackion '' ansatz of fth and slyom.@xcite one can check that the following construction satisfies the above requirements : @xmath44 here @xmath45 denotes the matrix corresponding to the variational ground state , and @xmath46 is the matrix describing singlet dimers on the diagonals ( it is easy to see from ( [ mp ] ) that @xmath47 is proportional to the unit matrix ) .",
    "in fact , the state ( [ ansatz1 ] ) describes two domain walls which correspond to transitions between the two inequivalent variational ground states mentioned above ; it is worthwhile to remark that the states @xmath48 are not mutually orthogonal .",
    "the presence of @xmath49 ensures that this state breaks the generalized string order and has the total spin @xmath1 and its @xmath50-projection @xmath51 ( the general technique of constructing mp states with given quantum numbers @xmath52 , @xmath53 can be found in ref . ) .",
    "the structure of the ansatz ( [ ansatz1 ] ) is schematically shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : extendpic ] .    at the mg point @xmath54 , and one can straightforwardly check that in this case eq .  ( [ ansatz1 ] ) describes a pair of unbound spins @xmath55 separating two completely dimerized regions , i.e.  it reduces to the ansatz of shastry and sutherland . on the other hand , if @xmath56 and @xmath57 , then the state ( [ ansatz1 ] ) is exactly the same as the `` crackion '' of fth and slyom .",
    "we use the following ( unnormalized ) trial wave function of the composite two - spinon excitation with a given total momentum @xmath58 : @xmath59 it contains two variational parameters @xmath60 and @xmath18 which can be considered as real and imaginary part of the relative momentum of the two spin-@xmath55 entities forming our composite particle .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 has the meaning of a localization length , or the average size of the composite object , and nonzero @xmath60 corresponds to the excitation of some internal degree of freedom .",
    "if the localization length diverges , @xmath61 , the wave function describes a triplet scattering state of two spinons , and finite @xmath18 corresponds to a bound state .    on the disorder line @xmath62 , according to ref .",
    ", the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 both equal @xmath65 , and the structure of our variational ansatz becomes rather obvious : it describes a bound state of two shastry - sutherland kinks ( `` free spins '' in a completely dimerized chain ) with the localization length @xmath18 .",
    "the energy for such an excitation can be calculated in the usual way : @xmath66 and has to be minimized over @xmath18 and @xmath60 , separately for any given @xmath58 ( as we will see below , it turns out that optimal @xmath18 strongly depends on @xmath58 ) . in this way one",
    "looks for a lowest variational state in a subspace with the total spin @xmath1 and certain momentum @xmath58 . calculating the averages in ( [ disp ] ) involving mp states can be done with the help of the standard technique .",
    "@xcite the final expression for @xmath67 is quite cumbersome because of the complicated structure of our trial wave function ( [ ansatz1 ] ) , so that we present here only the resulting dispersion plots for a number of representative points of the phase diagram .",
    "the minimization has been performed numerically .",
    "another , simpler ansatz can be obtained if one forces ( [ ansatz2 ] ) to be strongly localized , i.e. @xmath68 . then only the configurations with @xmath56 survive , and we obtain @xmath69 such an ansatz may be called `` regular , '' or localized crackion ( in contrast to our two - spinon ansatz ( [ ansatz2 ] ) describing an `` extended crackion '' ) because it exactly reproduces the structure of the wave function proposed by fth and slyom , and the only difference is in the generalized concept of the string order ( or , in other words , in the fact that matrices @xmath70 are allowed to contain singlet states ) .",
    "this `` regular '' crackion ansatz is essentially equivalent to the construction introduced recently by nakamura _",
    "@xcite within a slightly different approach using the kennedy - tasaki unitary transformation .",
    "in this section we present variational and numerical results for dispersion relations , lowest modes and their corresponding wave vectors for various points of the phase diagram . in the first subsection we study the spinon - type excitations on the symmetry line @xmath10 in the vicinity of the mg point .",
    "variational energies for scattering states and bound states are computed at the mg point @xmath17 , and the difference in behavior of the spectrum at @xmath71 and @xmath72 is discussed . in the second subsection",
    "we investigate the consequences of alternation .",
    "when one moves off the symmetry line , the crossover from spinon - type excitations to ladder - type ( `` crackion '' ) excitations occurs , being characterized by the change of the localization length @xmath73 from infinity to zero ; here @xmath74 denotes the wave vector of the lowest energy mode .",
    "we show that this crossover takes place at the @xmath75 boundary of the incommensurate region where @xmath74 changes gradually from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "these results are compared with numerical data from exact diagonalization for 24 spins . because the correlation lengths for the points taken into account are rather small , the numerical data are very close to the thermodynamic limit and therefore we do not perform any finite - size extrapolation .",
    "the ansatz ( [ ansatz1],[ansatz2 ] ) obviously becomes inadequate close to the symmetry line @xmath10 ( except for the mg point ) , because two variational minima of the ground state energy are inequivalent while the true ground state is twofold degenerate on this line .",
    "however , the interval of the symmetry line in the vicinity of the mg point ( i.e.  @xmath10 and @xmath6 close to @xmath65 ) can be studied with the help of the shastry - sutherland - type ansatz : it is sufficient to put @xmath78 in ( [ ansatz1],[ansatz2 ] ) . in the limit @xmath79 one gets exactly the ansatz of ref .   and can calculate variational energies for the scattering states . on the other hand , if we do not force @xmath80 , the energy of the lowest bound state can be calculated for each value of the total momentum @xmath58 . for the scattering",
    "states it is possible to obtain a compact analytical expression for the energy of such a two - particle excitation : @xmath81 here @xmath82 has the meaning of the spinon dispersion . at @xmath17",
    "it coincides with the result of ref .. ( it should be mentioned that since in this paper we consider the general case of an alternated chain , momenta in eqs .",
    "( [ ansatz2],[ss ] ) are defined in the halved brillouin zone , in contrast to ref . ) .",
    "the dispersion relation is determined by the lower boundary of the two - particle continuum .",
    "the resulting @xmath6-dependence of the gap @xmath83 is shown in fig.[fig : symgap ] , together with the numerical results by white and affleck.@xcite one can see that quantitatively this approach yields reasonable results only in the close vicinity of the mg point ; nevertheless , at the qualitative level it correctly predicts closing of the gap when decreasing @xmath6 and the existence of a maximum in @xmath84 at @xmath6 slightly greater than @xmath65 .",
    "characteristic plots of the dispersion of scattering states in the vicinity of the mg point are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : symspectra ] . from ( [ ss ] )",
    "one can see that for @xmath6 less than @xmath85 the single - spinon dispersion has a minimum at @xmath86 , and for larger @xmath6 this minimum shifts towards @xmath74 lower than @xmath77 .",
    "thus , the lower boundary of the two - spinon continuum always has the minimum at @xmath87 ( corresponding to @xmath88 ) , and for @xmath89 there appears another minimum at @xmath90 ( which corresponds to @xmath91 ) .",
    "when @xmath6 increases , this second minimum gets more pronounced .",
    "appearance of the lowest mode with incommensurate wave vector is closely related to the existence of the so - called disorder points @xcite where spin - spin correlations in real space become incommensurate .",
    "strictly speaking , the point where the wave vector of the lowest mode becomes incommensurate corresponds not to the disorder point itself , but to the so - called lifshitz point where the correlation function peak in momentum space ( i.e. , peak in the structure factor @xmath92 ) starts moving from commensurate to incommensurate @xmath60 .",
    "generally , the lifshitz point does not coincide with the disorder point and is situated at some small distance from the boundary of the incommensurate region . in our variational calculation",
    "the wave vector starts to change at @xmath85 , while the disorder line ( line of disorder points ) is numerically established @xcite to be @xmath62 , which means that at @xmath10 the disorder point is @xmath93 , in agreement with the above .",
    "we would like to end this subsection by pointing out the role of bound states . at the mg point",
    "it is known @xcite that bound states are lower in energy than scattering states for wave vectors @xmath58 close to the zone boundary .",
    "this was obtained in ref . by using the variational estimate for the upper bound of the dispersion ( see below ) .",
    "we can capture the dispersion of the lowest bound state in our approach if we minimize with respect to @xmath18 for each @xmath58 .",
    "for values of the total momentum @xmath94 we obtain @xmath95 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mgdisp ] . the same feature , namely the appearance of bound states as the lowest energy excitations , can be expected for @xmath89 and @xmath58 around the midpoint in between the two dispersion minima , but we did not perform this calculation .",
    "generally , more than one bound state may exist ; @xcite unfortunately , within the present approach one can access only the _ lowest _ bound state .",
    "first of all , we would like to focus on the disorder line @xmath62 .",
    "as soon as one moves off the mg point ( @xmath17 , @xmath10 ) towards the dimer point ( @xmath16 , @xmath19 ) , the energy of the mg ground state with singlets on diagonals picks up an energy proportional to the size of the system , while the other mg ground state with singlets on the rungs remains the true ground state . as a consequence , only bound states of spinons can survive",
    ": this is a typical confinement situation .",
    "the wave vector of the lowest mode is still @xmath87 .",
    "the main feature of this excitation is the @xmath58-dependent delocalization : the ground state is formed by a product of rung singlets .",
    "if we now replace one singlet by a triplet and superpose with wave vector @xmath77 , we obtain an exact eigenstate on the disorder line , whose energy gives the upper bound of the dispersion .",
    "@xcite to obtain the lowest mode we delocalize the up spins , which make up the triplet , with the amplitude @xmath96 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : extendpic ] and superpose with the wave vector @xmath87 .",
    "the bandwidth for this excitation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : disord ] ; one can see that the bandwidth increases along with the increase of the localization length @xmath18 from @xmath76 to @xmath97 on the way from the dimer point to the mg point ( here @xmath18 is not to be confused with the spin correlation length ! ) . at the mg point",
    "we reproduce the result of shastry and sutherland for the gap @xmath98 .",
    "one may say that here we observe the crossover from loosely bound spinons ( `` extended crackion '' , @xmath99 ) to spinons tightly bound into the haldane triplet ( `` crackion , '' @xmath100 ) , even though the crackion at the dimer point is a trivial ( dispersionless ) excitation .",
    "the same physical picture of crossover should be valid for any path beginning somewhere at the symmetry line and ending somewhere at sufficiently negative @xmath5 ; on the symmetry line @xmath73 should be infinite ( @xmath74 denotes the lowest mode wave vector ) , and it decreases to zero when @xmath101 is large enough . in the present approach we can observe this @xmath61 behavior only for the mg point , because for any other point on the symmetry line our two variational ground states become inequivalent and we lose the feature of twofold degeneracy .",
    "however , we believe that our approach remains reasonable for points which are far enough from the symmetry line , where the translational symmetry is explicitly broken and this effect overrides the built - in dimerization of our variational ansatz .",
    "it is worthwhile to make a few remarks concerning the behavior of the real part of relative momentum @xmath60 .",
    "because of the confinement , the energy of states with internal motion , i.e. with @xmath102 , has to be much higher compared to the states with zero relative momentum . in our variational calculations we were able to detect only one minimum which always occured at @xmath91 or @xmath103 ( strictly speaking , @xmath91 for @xmath104 and @xmath105 for @xmath106 , so that sets with @xmath91 and @xmath105 correspond to physically equivalent states ) .",
    "the crossover from ` extended crackion ' to crackion is related to the change of wave vector @xmath74 of the lowest mode , due to the following remarkable feature which we observed from our calculations and which is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma-1xi ] : _ everywhere in the gapped region of the phase diagram the property @xmath107 holds .",
    "_ thus , once @xmath74 has changed from @xmath76 to @xmath77 , we know that the lowest mode is a ` usual ' crackion because @xmath108 , so that the crossover takes place at the @xmath75 boundary of the incommensurate region . in order to determine the boundaries of the incommensurate region , we used our variational approach and compared the results with exact diagonalization data . in fig.[fig : disp](a ) dispersion relations for a few points on the vertical line @xmath17 are presented .",
    "numerical data and variational results are in a good agreement even though the lowest wave vectors are at slightly different positions ( one should keep in mind that numerical dispersions for finite chains consist of a finite number of points ) .",
    "[ fig : disp](b ) illustrates the change of @xmath74 when crossing the disorder line .",
    "similarly to the situation on the symmetry line as described in the previous subsection , one can see that @xmath74 starts to change from @xmath76 not exactly at the disorder line but slightly above it ( i.e. , the lifshitz line is not identical to the disorder line ) . the comparison with the numerical data as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp](a ) confirms this property , within the numerical accuracy ( exact diagonalization of 24 spins leads to 12 values for the wave vector which is not sufficient to mark the incommensurate region precisely but allows qualitative comparison ) .",
    "the boundaries of the incommensurate region obtained by the variational calculation are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] .",
    "it should be pointed out that our result for the @xmath75 boundary does not agree with that of pati et al .",
    "@xcite for example , we obtain that the @xmath75 boundary goes through the dimer point @xmath19 , @xmath16 , while the corresponding curve @xmath109 of fig",
    ".  2 from ref .   crosses the @xmath19 line at @xmath110 . at present",
    "we can not comment on the origin of this strong discrepancy .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss the vicinity of the line @xmath19 which includes the experimentally relevant ladder point ( @xmath20 , @xmath19 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : dispgamma-1 ] shows the dispersion curves for the `` regular '' crackion , the `` extended '' crackion and the numerical data for two points on this line ( one should mention that our data agree rather well with those of ref . ) .",
    "the dispersion curve of the extended crackion is located slightly below the curve of the crackion and coincides with it for @xmath111 , in agreement with the general property @xmath112 ( see also fig . [",
    "fig : gamma-1xi ] ) .",
    "one can also observe that the @xmath87 gap is slightly larger than @xmath113 , which indicates the repulsive character of the effective interaction between the elementary excitations in the ladder .",
    "[ fig : lmgamma-1 ] displays the lowest crackion mode @xmath114 in comparison with exact diagonalization data along the horizontal line @xmath19 , @xmath115 .",
    "we conclude that the ladder excitations can be described by the usual crackion ansatz , and the isotropic spin ladder has the same type of elementary excitation as the effective @xmath1 chain which appears as the limit @xmath116 of the generalized frustrated ladder . in that limit",
    "the localization length @xmath18 collapses for all values of @xmath58 because creation of singlets on the diagonals would cost infinite energy .",
    "we have presented a variational matrix - product ansatz for elementary excitations in the gapped phase of the @xmath0 ladder with an additional frustrating diagonal coupling @xmath117 , @xmath7 ; the strength of interaction along the legs is @xmath6 , and the interaction along the rungs is chosen to be unity .",
    "this system is equivalent to the antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath65 zigzag chain with alternating exchange ( the magnitude of alternation is proportional to @xmath5 ) and next - nearest neighbor interaction @xmath6 .",
    "our ansatz describes a triplet state of two @xmath0 entities ( `` spinons '' ) and allows one to interpolate between free and bound spinons by varying the parameter @xmath18 which has the meaning of a localization length ( average distance between spinons in the pair ) .",
    "this state is constructed to be a soliton in generalized string order @xcite and in the limit @xmath118 of effective @xmath1 haldane chain it coincides with the `` crackion '' ansatz proposed by fth and slyom @xcite if the localization length @xmath68 ; for that reason we call our ansatz an `` extended crackion . ''",
    "the limit @xmath119 leads to the two - particle excitation of shastry and sutherland , @xcite which corresponds to free spinons existing in absence of the alternation ( i.e. , on the symmetry line @xmath10 ) .    using our variational ansatz , we calculated dispersion relations for various points in the phase diagram .",
    "these results were compared to exact numerical diagonalization data for 24 spins and showed a reasonable agreement of the two approaches .",
    "the variational parameter @xmath18 was determined separately for each value of the total momentum @xmath58 ; it turns out that @xmath120 has nontrivial behavior , particularly the property @xmath121 was numerically observed in the entire range of studied model parameters .",
    "we determined the boundaries of the incommensurate region ( strictly speaking , the corresponding lifshitz lines ) by locating the wave vector @xmath74 of the lowest mode : for @xmath122 the wave vector is pinned at @xmath123 , slightly after crossing this line it starts to change from @xmath76 to @xmath77 , and , finally , at some other line it gets again pinned at @xmath75 ( in terms of the full brillouin zone of the chain this corresponds to the change from @xmath77 to @xmath124 ) .",
    "we show that in the interval between the symmetry line @xmath10 and the @xmath125 boundary of the incommensurate region the dispersion of elementary excitations is well described by our bound spinons ansatz .",
    "the crossover of the lowest mode from `` extended crackion '' to `` localized '' crackion ( i.e. , from finite @xmath73 to @xmath126 ) occurs at the @xmath75 boundary of the incommensurate region , due to the above - mentioned property of the function @xmath120 . for the isotropic ladder point ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) a localized crackion ansatz with @xmath127 is sufficient to describe the excitations .    to conclude , we propose a simple ansatz providing a reasonably good description of the elementary excitations in the gapped phase of the frustrated @xmath0 chain with alternation for a wide range of the model parameters .",
