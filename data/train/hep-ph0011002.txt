    "experiments on deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons off nucleons is a unique source of information about strong interaction .",
    "these experiments were initiated at slac linac and later were continued at different accelerators using the fixed targets and the colliding electron - proton beams . the data for proton and deuterium targets , given in refs .",
    "@xcite are especially valuable , since no heavy - nucleus corrections are needed for their interpretation . those data combined with the results from hera electron - proton collider @xcite allows one to determine the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and are widely used for this purpose . in particular ,",
    "global fits of pdfs , which are regularly updated by collaborations mrst @xcite and cteq@xcite , rely heavily on the dis data .",
    "it is often mentioned , that the mrst and cteq pdfs lack information on uncertainties , that does not allow one to estimate the uncertainties on the cross sections , which are calculated using those pdfs .",
    "most often these uncertainties are estimated as a spread of results , obtained using different pdfs sets . meanwhile ,",
    "it is evident , that if different pdfs are based on the same theoretical model fitted to a similar data sets , this spread mainly reflects uncertainties of calculations , rather , than real uncertainties arising from statistical and systematic errors on the data used for the extraction of pdfs .",
    "besides , those collaborations combine statistical and systematic errors in quadrature , i.e. do not account for the correlation of the latter . since systematic errors dominate over statistical ones for many dis experiments , they govern total experimental errors on the pdfs parameters fitted to the data and ignorance of their correlations may lead to the distortion of the parameters errors and to the bias of their central values .",
    "statistical and systematic errors are combined in quadrature in part by historical reasons .",
    "the other reason is that , contrary to the case of statistical errors , existing approaches to the account of systematic errors are not so straightforward and encounter with technical difficulties generated by correlations between measurements , which become more significant when the systematic errors rise , as compared with the statistical ones .",
    "nevertheless , as it was shown in ref.@xcite on the example of combined analysis of dis data from refs.@xcite with the complete account of correlations due to systematic errors , these difficulties can be overcomed using in the fit an estimator based on the covariance matrix .",
    "the results of the combined analysis of data from refs.@xcite , which attempted to account for correlations of systematic errors , was later given in ref.@xcite , but due to the large number of independent sources of the systematic errors , they were combined with the statistical errors partially .",
    "regardless of the expressed confidence that this procedure should have minimal impact on the results , this point is not ultimately clarified and it is evident that errors on the obtained pdfs may be distorted .    in this paper",
    "we describe the results of the combined analysis of the world data on the charged leptons dis off the proton and deuterium targets given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in comparison with our previous fit of ref.@xcite in the present analysis",
    "we use data with lower values of transferred momentum @xmath5 .",
    "besides , the data from the slac experiments and the experiment fnal - e-665 are added . as well as in ref.@xcite , we extract from the data the nucleon pdfs and the value of strong coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , wealth of data at low @xmath5 allows one to determine the high twist ( ht ) contributions to the structure functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 as well .",
    "analysis is performed in the nlo qcd approximation with the complete account of correlations due to systematic errors within approach described in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is well known that the dis cross section of charged leptons off nucleons can be expressed in terms of structure functions @xmath6 . for example , at 4-momentum transfers @xmath5 less , than the @xmath7-boson mass the charged leptons cross section reads @xmath8 , \\label{eqn : discs}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the s.c.m .",

    "within the operator product expansion @xcite the structure functions are given by the sum of contributions coming from operators of different twists .",
    "for the unpolarized lepton scattering the even twists larger or equal to two contribute only . thus with the account of the twist-4 contribution @xmath16 where @xmath17 gives the leading twist ( lt ) with the account of target mass corrections , as calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the structure functions of twist 2 .",
    "such approach allows us to separate pure kinematical corrections , so that the functions @xmath23 correspond to `` genuine '' or `` dynamical '' contribution of the twist 4 operators .",
    "note , that the parametrization ( [ eqn : addht ] ) implies , that the anomalous dimensions of the twist 4 operators are equal to zero , that is invalid in general case",
    ". moreover , there are attempts to estimate these anomalous dimensions from the account of the correlations between partons ( see ref.@xcite ) . meanwhile , in view of limited precision of the data , approximation ( [ eqn : addht ] ) is rather good ( see also discussion in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the leading twist structure functions can be expressed in factorized form as the mellin convolution of pdfs @xmath24 with the coefficient functions @xmath25 : @xmath26q_i(x / z,\\mu_{\\rm f } ) , \\label{eqn : factor}\\ ] ] where index @xmath27 marks the partons species and @xmath0 is running strong coupling constant .",
    "the dependence of pdfs on @xmath5 is described by the dglap evolution equations @xcite @xmath28q_j(x / z , q ) , \\label{eqn : dglap}\\ ] ] and the pdfs evolution is governed by the splitting functions @xmath29 , which in turn depend on @xmath0 .",
    "the quantities @xmath30 and @xmath31 in eqs.([eqn : factor ] ) and ( [ eqn : dglap ] ) give the factorization and renormalization scales respectively . in the @xmath32 renormalization - factorization scheme , used in our analysis , these scales are chosen equal to the value of @xmath5 usually .",
    "the splitting and coefficient functions can be calculated in perturbative qcd as series in @xmath0 . for the coefficient functions these series are completely calculated up to the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) @xcite ; for the splitting functions the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections are known , while for the nnlo corrections a limited set of the mellin moments @xcite , as well as some asymptotes , are available only ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , there are attempts to analyse the dis data in the nnlo qcd approximation with the consideration of the available moments only @xcite , or modelling splitting functions @xcite .",
    "our analysis is performed in the nlo qcd approximation with the use of the splitting and coefficient functions in @xmath12-space as they are given in ref .",

    "was chosen equal to 3 for @xmath41 , 4 for @xmath42 , and 5 for @xmath43 , where @xmath44 are masses of the @xmath45- , @xmath46- and @xmath47-quarks correspondingly , and when @xmath40 changes , the continuity of @xmath48 is kept ( see ref.@xcite for argumentation of this approach ) .",
    "the choice of the quark mass value as the threshold for @xmath40 switching is optional .",
    "e.g. , in the analysis of heavy quark contribution to the dis sum rules , given in ref.@xcite , this threshold is chosen equal to @xmath49 . unfortunately any choice can not be completely justified , while the dependence of results on the variation of threshold , say in the interval from @xmath50 to @xmath49 , generates one of the sources of theoretical uncertainties inherent to this analysis .",
    "since the value of @xmath0 depends on the threshold position logarithmically , for estimation of this uncertainty we shifted this threshold value to the logarithmic centre of this interval , i.e. from @xmath50 to @xmath51 . very often ,",
    "approximate solutions of eq.([eqn : alphanlo ] ) , based on the expansions of @xmath0 in inverse powers of @xmath52 are used in calculation .",
    "inaccuracy of these expansions for evolution of @xmath0 from @xmath53 to @xmath54 may be as large as @xmath55 @xcite , which is comparable with the experimental uncertainties of the @xmath56 value extracted from the data . in order to escape these uncertainties we use in the analysis the exact numerical solution of eq.([eqn : alphanlo ] ) instead .",
    "since we use the truncated perturbative series , the results depend on the factorization scale @xmath30 and the renormalization scale @xmath31 . these dependences cause additional theoretical uncertainties of the analysis the accurate estimate of these uncertainties is difficult , because the possible range of the scales variation is undefined and besides , one is to change factorization scheme as well . in our analysis",
    "we estimate only the theoretical uncertainty due to the choice of @xmath31 in the evolution equations ( [ eqn : dglap ] ) using the approach described in ref.@xcite . in accordance with this approach",

    "the change of results under variation of @xmath61 from 1/2 to 2 gives an estimate of the error due to renormlization scale uncertainty .",
    "evidently that , by definition , this uncertainty is connected with the impact of unaccounted terms of the perturbative series .",
    "in order to obtain the pdfs from evolution equations , one is to supply a boundary conditions at some starting value @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath12-dependence of pdfs can not be calculated from the modern strong interaction theory , it is determined from the comparison with data .",
    "usual parametrization of the pdfs at @xmath62 reads @xmath63 for this parametrization the behaviour of @xmath24 at low @xmath12 is motivated by the regge phenomenology ( see , e.g. , book @xcite ) and at high @xmath12 , by the quark counting rules @xcite",
    ". if such a simple form is insufficient for the fair data description , polynomial - like factors are added .",
    "value of @xmath62 is arbitrary , but it is natural to choose it as @xmath53 to allow for simple interpretation of the boundary pdfs .",
    "meanwhile , it was recently shown in ref.@xcite , that the choice of @xmath62 is important to provide the results stable with respect to the account of higher order qcd corrections ( see also ref.@xcite ) . at low @xmath62",
    "the twist 4 contribution extracted from the data is less sensitive to the choice of the renormalization scale @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dglap ] ) , than at high @xmath62 . the @xmath56 behaves in opposite way , and then the choice @xmath64 , made in our analysis , provides stability of the @xmath65 and pdfs values if the nnlo qcd corrections are considered .",
    "despite of the fact , that the evolution equations have been used in the dis data analysis for many years , no unique approach for solving them exists .",
    "analytical expressions can be obtained only for the simplified splitting functions , and direct numerical approaches demand threefold integration , which is time consuming .",
    "there are semi - analytical approaches , based on expansion of pdfs in terms of selected sets of functions , but such approaches , as a rule , lead to loosing of the universality with respect to the choice of splitting functions and require careful control of the calculations precision . due to the form of the evolution equation kernel is rather complicated , correct implementation of a sophisticated integration algorithm meets the difficulties . in the comparative analysis of different codes ,",
    "used for the dglap equations integration , the codes of the cteq and mrst collaborations were found to contain the bugs ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "taking into account these points , we use in the analysis our own code for direct numerical integration of eq.([eqn : dglap ] ) , based on the euler predictor - corrector algorithm ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this code allows one to modify kernels of the evolution equations in order to debug the code , to control the calculation precision , to take into account effects of new physics , and to implement special cases of evolution .",
    "integration region can be expanded easily , and the integration precision is regulated by the external parameters of the code . for typical values of these parameters the code integration precision , as estimated using benchmark described in ref.@xcite , is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : bench ] .",
    "one can see that the relative precision is better , than 0.001 in the region @xmath66 and better , than 0.01 in the region @xmath67 .",
    "this is well enough for our purposes , since the errors on data are larger , than the integration errors for all @xmath12 .",
    "since eq.([eqn : dglap ] ) is valid for massless partons only , the heavy quarks contribution , which is significant at low @xmath12 , should be considered in a peculiar way . in the approach described in ref .",
    "@xcite the heavy quarks are considered as massless ones .",
    "they are included into the general evolution starting from a threshold value of @xmath5 , which is proportional to the quark mass , while at the values of @xmath5 lower the threshold these distributions are put to zero .",
    "evidently , in this approach the heavy quarks contribution is overestimated in the vicinity of the threshold .",
    "alternative way to consider the heavy quarks contribution is to calculate it using the photon - gluon fusion model of ref.@xcite . at high @xmath5 and low @xmath12 `` large logarithms '' arise in the elementary cross section of this process , that may demand its resummation @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , as it was shown in ref.@xcite , the region of @xmath12 and @xmath5 , where the resummation is really needed lays outside the region of the available dis data . for this reason we calculated the @xmath45- and @xmath46- quarks contributions to the structure functions @xmath15 using the photon - gluon fusion model with the nlo coefficient functions of ref.@xcite and the renormalization / factorization scales equal to @xmath68 at the quark masses @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the lt contribution to the dis structure functions is rather well understood both from theoretical and experimental points of view .",
    "since this contribution depends on @xmath5 weakly one can reject the low @xmath5 data points and leave the data set , which is both statistically significant , and can be analysed within perturbative qcd in order to determine the lt @xmath12-dependence .",
    "the ht contribution is worse known , than the lt one .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the ht @xmath12-dependence is equally difficult as for the lt @xmath12-dependence and , as a result , it should be determined from data . meanwhile , due to the fast fall of the ht contribution with @xmath5 it is significant for @xmath71 only . at very low @xmath5",
    "the subtraction of the lt contribution , as calculated in perturbative qcd is problematic due to the rise of @xmath0 . as a result",
    ", only the data for @xmath72 @xmath5 can be used for the ht extraction and the results precision is poor .",
    "study of the possibility to separate the ht and lt contributions has a long history ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . despite of that the @xmath5-dependences of these contributions are different , in the limited range of @xmath5 the ht power corrections can simulate the logarithmic lt behaviour @xcite .",
    "moreover , as it was shown in refs.@xcite , the power corrections can almost entirely describe the scaling violation observed for the dis data , if the data precision is limited .",
    "in particular , this causes large correlations between the fitted values of @xmath0 and the ht contribution .",
    "this correlation leads to the rise of the fitted parameters errors .",
    "the rise of errors is unpleasant effect , moreover , the fitted model non - linearity can become essential as a result . besides , the fit results become less stable with respect to the change of the non - fitted parameters and adoptions of the fitted model , i.e. , the theoretical errors on the fitted parameters rise also . finally , if large correlations between parameters occur , the second derivative matrix for the minimized functional is poor determined and the calculations inaccuracies increase when its inversion .",
    "for this reason in order to get satisfactory precision of the parameters errors one is to guarantee better precision of the fitted model calculation , which may be time consuming , if manifold integration is involved . due to",
    "this is the case for our analysis , estimation of the correlation coefficients between the fitted values of @xmath0 and the ht contribution is non - trivial problem .",
    "we fit the pdfs to the data on the charged leptons dis off proton and deuterium given in refs .",
    "the data points with @xmath73 were not used in the analysis in order to reject the region , where @xmath0 is rather large and the nnlo order qcd correction may be important .",
    "the points with @xmath74 , for which the nuclear corrections are large , were removed also .",
    "the data used in the analysis occupy the region @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "the number of data points for each experiment is given in table  [ tab : global ] .",
    "the starting pdfs were initially parametrized at @xmath64 as follows : @xmath77 and then the parameters @xmath78 , which agree with zero within errors , were by turn fixed at zero till such parameters existed . evidently , the fit quality could not get worse , when such parameters are fixed .",
    "the pdfs functional form resulted from this simplification and used in the final fit reads : @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 where @xmath85 are the up , down , strange quarks , and gluons distributions respectively ; indices @xmath86 and @xmath87 correspond to the valence and sea quarks .",
    "the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 were not fitted , instead they were calculated from the other parameters using the conservation of the partons momentum and the fermion number .",
    "the parameter @xmath90 was calculated using the relation @xmath91dx = a_{\\rm s}.\\ ] ] it is well known , that the charged leptons data do not allow to confine the sea quarks contribution .",
    "for this reason the parameter @xmath92 was fixed at 0.42 , which agrees with the recent results of the nutev collaboration , given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the other sea distributions parameters were constrained as @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "the dis cross sections calculated from the qcd evolved pdfs using eq.([eqn : discs ] ) with the account of the tmc corrections given by eq.([eqn : f2tmc ] ) and the twist 4 contribution in additive form as in eq.([eqn : addht ] ) , were fitted to the cross section data data from the h1 and zeus experiments were corrected for the @xmath7-boson contribution , eq.([eqn : discs ] ) is applicable for these data also . ] .",
    "the ht contributions to the proton and neutron structure functions @xmath1 were parametrized by separate functions @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively , and the ht contributions to the proton and neutron structure functions @xmath2 , by the common function @xmath97 , since the latter coincide within errors .",
    "the functions @xmath98 and @xmath99 were parametrized in the model independent way : at @xmath100 their values were fitted to the data , and between these point the functions were linearly interpolated .",
    "the common approach for the pdfs global fits is to use data on @xmath1 instead of the data on cross sections . within this approach",
    "one ignores the fact , that the @xmath1 values given by different experiments are often extracted from the cross sections using different values of @xmath2 . in our fit",
    "the @xmath2 contribution to the cross section was calculated iteratively and , efficiently , the data were reduced to the common value of @xmath2 .",
    "since the @xmath2 contribution rises with @xmath11 , the effect of this reduction is more important at high @xmath11 . due to the collision energy of each experiment",
    "is limited , the highest values of @xmath11 correspond to the minimal values of @xmath12 .",
    "for this reason the @xmath1 data points shifts due to the reduction to the common value of @xmath2 are not very significant in average , but at the edges of the experiments data regions may reach several percents .",
    "note , that at low @xmath12 the @xmath2 value strongly depends on the gluon distribution and , hence , in the fit to the cross sections data an additional constraint for the gluon distribution occurs , i.e. it is better confined , as compared to the fit to the @xmath1 data .",
    "the tmc correction is most important for the slac data , less important for the bcdms data , almost unimportant for the nmc data , and negligible for the others .",
    "note , that our tmc correction to @xmath1 given by eq.([eqn : f2tmc ] ) differs from that applied in ref.@xcite , where the substitution @xmath101 was used to account for the target mass effect .",
    "the numerical difference between these two approaches is maximal at high @xmath12 and low @xmath5 , e.g. , for the slac data it reaches 40% . besides , our tmc correction , contrary to that given by eq.([eqn : tmcmrs ] )",

    "the deuterium correction value rises with @xmath12 and reaches 16% for the slac data .",
    "this correction was calculated iteratively in the fit to provide consistency of the analysis .",
    "the two - dimensional integrals involved in the model were calculated using the code of ref.@xcite , which provides better numerical stability , than the standard codes based on the gauss integration algorithm . for the calculations time",
    "saving we adopted , that the fermi motion correction for the structure function @xmath103 is the same , as for the structure function @xmath1 ( we checked that this adoption does not significantly affect the results ) .",

    "the data from the old slac experiments , as they were given in ref.@xcite , are the result of re - analysis of the original experimental data published earlier ( for the details see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "one of the purposes of this re - analysis was to renormalize the old data on the data from dedicated experiment slac - e-140 .",
    "however , due to the latter did not release the proton target data , the renormalization of the proton data was performed using the experiment slac - e-49b as a `` bridge '' .",
    "such technique certainly brings additional uncertainties on the re - analysed data . in order to escape those uncertainties we performed the independent renormalization of the old slac experiments without a `` bridging '' , that is possible in our case , since we use more proton data , than in the analysis of ref.@xcite . for this purpose",
    "we fitted the factors @xmath113 for each target of each old slac experiment independently .",

    "for the cme the fitted parameters systematic errors due to the data systematic errors are automatically included in the total error ; for sce the parameters systematic errors are estimated as the shift of the parameters under the shift of the data by the value of their systematic errors .",
    "the sce dispersion is always larger , than the cme dispersion and , as it was shown in ref.@xcite , the ratio of these dispersions can reach several units for realistic cases .",
    "it was shown also , that the cme is unbiased if the systematic errors on the parameters are not much more , than the statistical ones . in order to control the estimator bias one can trace the value of the net residual @xmath118 , equal to the mean of weighted residual @xmath119 .",
    "the @xmath116 values and the net residuals for the total data set and for each experiment separately calculated at the parameters values fitted using the cme are given in table  [ tab : global ] .",

    "if data are well described by fitted model , then for large @xmath122 the values of @xmath123 obey the normal distribution , i.e. the gauss distribution with zero mean and the dispersion equal to 1 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath123 for the zeus data is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : resid ] .",
    "evidently it does not agree with the normal distribution , that is not surprising , since the data description is poor .",
    "note , that the diagonalized residuals mean is small for the zeus data ( 0.05 ) , meanwhile , the dispersion is equal to 2.1 , i.e. it is far from the normal distribution dispersion .",
    "it is difficult to ascribe this discrepancy to the shortcoming of the fitted model , since , as it seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : resid ] , analogues distribution for the h1 data agrees with the normal distribution perfectly , whereas both experiments gained similar statistical and kinematical coverage .",
    "one more possible explanation of this disagreement is , that the systematic errors given by the zeus collaboration are underestimated , but still are gaussian distributed . in such cases",
    "the pdg scales the errors so that @xmath124 becomes equal to 1 ( see review @xcite ) . in our case",
    "this approach can not be used , since number of independent sources of the systematic errors in the zeus experiment is large and a lot of variants of such rescaling can be applied .",
    "besides , the distribution of residuals would remain non - gaussian after the errors rescaling ( see dashed curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : resid ] ) .",
    "driven by this consideration one can suppose that systematic errors on the zeus data are non - gaussian distributed ( but with zero mean ) and then @xmath124 must not be equal to 1 .",
    "if so , the fitted parameters , which are confined by the zeus data , also may be distributed in arbitrary way ( see in this connection ref.@xcite ) .",
    "due to exact estimation of the confidence intervals for unknown distribution is impossible , we recommend for this purpose , in particular for evaluating the pdfs errors at low @xmath12 , the robust estimate of the confidence intervals , based on the chebyshev inequality ( see discussion in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the dispersion of the net residual @xmath118 is maximal for the slac - e-140 , bcdms , and nmc data sets .",
    "( remind , that this dispersion rises with the increase of data correlation , full correlation corresponds to the dispersion of @xmath118 equal to 1 ) .",
    "thus , one can conclude , that the account of the bcdms and nmc data correlations has the largest impact on the analysis results , since number of points in the slac - e-140 data set is small .",
    "this conclusion is in line with the results of ref.@xcite , where it was obtained , that in the combined fit to the non - singlet slac - bcdms data the account of the bcdms data correlations leads to much more significant shift of the parameters , than the account of the slac data correlations .",
    "the value of @xmath118 for the total data set is well within its standard deviation , that confirms the fit unbiasness .",
    "the fitted pdfs parameters are given in table  [ tab : pdfpars ] .",
    "we underline , that in our fit the universality of the valence @xmath125- and @xmath126-quarks behaviour at low @xmath12 is not initially assumed , contrary to the popular global fits practice , and the fit results confirm this universality with the few percents precision . at the same time",
    "the regge phenomenology prediction ( see , e.g. , book  @xcite ) @xmath127 is in disagreement with the fit results ) is often used for theoretical estimates . ] .",
    "a possible interpretation of this disagreement is , that eq.([eqn : redge ] ) , as it is deduced , is not related to a particular value of @xmath5 , while the qcd evolution does change the pdfs @xmath12-behaviour . as it was shown in ref.@xcite , for the non - singlet distributions at low @xmath12",
