    "@xmath5 the weak radiative decays have been first analyzed theoretically about forty years ago @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was envisaged already in @xcite a possibility to understand it in the framework of pole model similar to the nonleptonic hyperon decays .",
    "even earlier estimations of the decay rates were made basing on the pion photoproduction amplitudes @xcite . at the same time",
    "two experiments were performed @xcite , where the first events of the decay @xmath6 were found ( in all 7 events ) .",
    "unitary symmetry arrived , more elaborated schemes appeared ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and a theorem was proved by hara that decay asymmetry in the charged hyperon weak radiative decays @xmath6 and @xmath7 should vanish in the limit of exact @xmath2 @xcite while it can be non zero for the neutral decays @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "since experimental discovery of a large negative asymmetry in the radiative decay @xmath10 @xcite , confirmed later @xcite ( see the table 1 ) , the explanation of the net contradiction between experimental results and the hara theorem prediction `` has constituted a constant challenge to theorists '' @xcite .",
    "the contradiction looks even more strange in the light of existing estimates for asymmetry values of other hyperon radiative decays which though not measured so precise as that of @xmath6 seem to be of the same order of magnitude @xcite",
    ". it would eventually require large @xmath2 symmetry breaking terms but they hardly can be large enough due to the well - known ademollo - gatto theorem @xcite in order to be able to account for this difficulty .",
    "another puzzle is related to inconsistency between @xmath11 symmetry and quark model predictions for the asymmetry value in the hyperon weak radiative decays .",
    "indeed , the hara theorem was formulated at the hadron level in terms of the @xmath11 baryon wave functions .",
    "it would seem natural if in the framework of a quark model one arrived at a similar result with some minor deviations .",
    "but quark models while more or less succeding in describing experimental data on branching ratios and asymmetry parameters ( see , e.g. , a review @xcite and citations therein ) did not reproduce the hara claim without making vanish all asymmetry parameters in the @xmath2 symmetry limit .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is not clear up to now although many authors have investigated this problem thoroughly @xcite-@xcite ( see also @xcite for very complete list of publications ) and is a real puzzle as similar calculations say of baryon magnetic moments are known to be rather consistent at the quark and hadron level .",
    "a single quark weak radiative transition @xmath12 was calculated in the framework of the standard weinberg - salam model with diagram technique @xcite , and it was shown that its decay asymmetry is proportional to the ratio @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the current quark mass . the same result was obtained earlier in @xcite on invoking chiral symmetry arguments .",
    "so the parity - violating quark transition amplitude goes to zero in the chiral symmetry limit .",
    "but these results can not be , generally speaking , immediately translated to the hyperon weak radiative decays , as one should first relate current quark evaluations to baryon picture which is far from trivial .",
    "but the single - quark contributions proved to be too small to account for the observed decay rates .",
    "even penguin diagram contributions are not strong enough to enhance an effective @xmath15 .",
    "two - quark weak radiative diagrams ( those with exchange of w - boson between two quarks , one of them emitting a photon , the third quark being a spectator ) were shown to give in general nonzero contribution to decay asymmetry of all 5 hyperon radiative decays including @xmath6 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "( note that the 6th decay @xmath7 can not proceed via the two - quark w - exchange diagram ) .",
    "moreover their contribution into the decay rate proved to be important .",
    "but the problem of the mutual inconsistency between two - quark diagram results and hara theorem prediction still persists .    in what follows",
    "we shall try to show that a discrepancy between the hara theorem prediction and experimental result for the asymmetry in the decay @xmath6 may be overcome due to alternative possibility of multipole parametrization of the axial transition electromagnetic current which include not only dipole transition moment but also contribution of the toroid dipole moment @xcite .",
    "as it has been pointed recently @xcite , toroid dipole moment naturally arrives in the parity - violating ( pv ) part of the transition weak radiative matrix element and leads to reformulation of the hara theorem .",
    "we shall also show that the vasanti result as to the single - quark weak radiative transition @xcite is reproduced in our scheme while going from hadron to quark level .",
    "two - quark weak radiative transition are considered also and a source of discrepancy between the results of @xmath16 symmetry approach of @xcite and that of quark models @xcite and others seems to be established .",

    "the derivatives of formfactors @xmath87 and @xmath88 define the corresponding transition averaged radii . since @xmath89",
    "we obtain approximately  @xcite @xmath90 note that @xmath91 here has pure kinematical origin , that is with @xmath92 the decay discussed would not go .",
    "hence , we are forced conserving the possibility of baryon decays to go over to the threshold value of @xmath93 instead of the static point @xmath94 where the diagonal moments are usually determined .",
    "the last formula partly resolves a puzzle with the hara theorem . indeed in the @xmath2 limit :    * the dipole transition moments of the charged hyperon decays should vanish and presumably stay small due to ademollo - gatto theorem @xcite even in the presence of the @xmath2 breaking terms ; * the toroid transition dipole moments defined by the eq.([2.83 ] ) need not to be zero for these decays as their contributions decouples automatically in the limit @xmath95 .",
    "so the toroid transition dipole moment of the @xmath0 may be in the origin of the large asymmetry observed @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 in order to state our result in another way we write the pv part of the weak radiative transition matrix element with the lorentz structure @xmath96 in the framework of the @xmath2 symmetry approach following strictly @xcite as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the @xmath99 baryon octet , @xmath100 etc . , and @xmath101 and @xmath102 are up to a factor the toroid dipole moments of the neutral and charged hyperon weak radiative transitions , respectively .",
    "it is easy to see that this matrix element is invariant under the exchange of the indices 2 to 3 and _ vice versa _ as it should be in the standard model of weak interaction .",
    "positive signs in front of every baryon bilinear combination arrive due to hermitian conjugation properties of the relevant lorentz structure @xmath103 . now in eq.([new ] ) all @xmath104 pv radiative transitions are open in contrast to the hara expression @xcite : @xmath105 based on another lorentz structure form @xmath106 @xcite due to hermitian conjugation properties of it pv transitions for the decays @xmath107 and @xmath108 do not appear in the eq.([hara ] ) as the relevant terms @xmath109 being invariant under exchange of indices 2 to 3 and _ vice versa _ , change sign under hermitian conjugation and so sum up to zero .",
    "this is in fact a source of all the troubles with the hyperon weak radiative decays evaluations .",
    "indeed contributions of the neutral hyperon decays @xmath8 , @xmath9 and those charged @xmath107 and @xmath110 being decoupled , it is difficult to hope that @xmath11 symmetry breaking terms would be of the same strength as the coupling constant @xmath111 , as the ademollo - gatto theorem @xcite forbids here great corrections .",
    "moreover , even any @xmath11 symmetry corrections are present , they should be more or less equal for pairs @xmath8 , @xmath107 and @xmath112 , @xmath110 as in both cases there are practically the same differences of masses either in charged or in neutral hyperon weak radiative decays . and",
    "then one predicts zero or small asymmetry for the decays @xmath107 and @xmath110 and non - zero ( and eventually large ) asymmetry for the decays @xmath8 and @xmath9 . as we know",
    "experimental data give large and negative asymmetry for the decay @xmath107 and indicate an asymmetry of the same order of magnitude for other measurable decays in net contradiction with the hara theorem prediction .",
    "instead the parameters @xmath113 in eq.([new ] ) opens a possibility to account for large nonzero asymmetry in the charged hyperon radiative decays even in the @xmath2 symmetry limit and thus eventually overcome a contradiction with experiment .",
    "we display in the table 1 the experimental data from @xcite and in the table 2 the results of eq.([new ] ) ( see the 3rd column of the table 2 ) and @xcite ( see the 2nd column of the table 2 ) .",
    "we have also put there results of a traditional single - quark radiative transition which we have taken from @xcite just to show in what way our new current in eq.([new ] ) can reproduce results of a quark model in a single - quark diagram approximation ( that is with a single quark weak radiative transition @xmath114 , two other quarks being spectators ) .",
    "for that purpose it is sufficient to assume that hyperon radiative decays in the @xmath2 model are described by the effective @xmath115 octet neutral weak current similar in form to that of the effective @xmath115 nonleptonic hyperon transitions ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) : @xmath116 this _ ad hoc _ assumption in the usual @xmath117 symmetry limit ( that is with @xmath118 ) which corresponds to use of the nonrelativistic quark model , yields the known results of the single - quark approach as can be easily seen from the table 2 ( note a sign difference for the @xmath119 hyperon wave function in @xcite while putting @xmath120 ) . instead with the @xmath121 one arrives at the results given by the new formulation of the hara theorem with @xmath122 .",
    "this indicates explicitly a source of contradiction between the hara theorem @xcite and single - quark model @xcite predictions .",
    "assuming that all asymmetry in the decay @xmath107 is given by the toroid dipole transition moment we have found an upper bound for it from the experimental data @xcite using eqs.([alpha ] , [ rate ] , [ new ] ) to be @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) .",

    "@xmath5 radiative hyperon decays were analyzed first in @xcite at the quark level upon taking into account chiral invariance considerations .",

    "this result dictates the insertion of the factor @xmath147 into the parameter @xmath148 ( see the 2nd column of the table 2 and single - quark transition terms in @xcite and other works cited in @xcite ) to assure the correct behavior of the corresponding quark pv transition amplitudes . and _ vice versa _ , the results of @xcite and @xcite together with the generalized gordon identities show that at the quark level it is a toroid dipole moment with its characteristic lorentz structure @xmath149 which is generated through the feynman diagrams contributions of @xcite .",
    "this result is valid also for the penguin diagram contributions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) which have similar to eq.([m ] ) lorentz structure for the case of a real photon emission .",
    "indeed , single - quark contributions yield the values of the toroid dipole moment @xmath150 for the @xmath12 decay at the level of @xmath151@xmath124 , while qcd one - loop corrections ( for recent calculations see , e.g. , @xcite ) have a trend to diminish it drastically .",
    "the long - distance corrections ( see , e.g. @xcite ) could raise it by an order of magnitude .",

    "neither penguin diagram contributions are strong enough to enhance an effective @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "this result is not surprising as the same has been proved to be true for the effective @xmath157 where @xmath158 are light quarks @xcite .",
    "so one has also to consider the two - quark weak radiative transitions @xmath159 which proceed via w - exchange and appears to be dominant .",
    "it has been done in the thoughtful works of @xcite and others and compilated in a very complete review of @xcite . in the calculations",

    "the results of @xcite do not rely heavily on the choice of the current quarks . indeed , if one wants to treat the quark diagrams properly one should use current quarks .",
    "but the internal symmetry of two - quark @xmath161-exchange contributions into the hyperon radiative decays can be understood , as we shall see , already at the level of the nonrelativistic quark model with the baryon wave functions given by the @xmath162 model .",
    "let us just start from the nrqm diagrams of the kind given in fig.1 and fig.2 .",
    "we shall write here at some length the way of our reasoning for @xmath155 decay , putting other decays into appendix a. thus the @xmath155 decay amplitude can be casted in the form @xmath163 where @xmath164 just mean the helicity state @xmath165 of the quarks inside the baryon , respectively .",
    "the @xmath166 is an operator which we do not need to write explicitly here .",
    "the 1st matrix element on the rhs of the eq.([sigma ] ) @xmath167 in the case of w - exchange between the quarks can be described only by the diagram fig.1(1 ) , as there is not possible to represent it by a diagram with a spectator quark .",
