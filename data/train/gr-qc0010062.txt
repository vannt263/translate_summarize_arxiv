    "the notion of energy and momentum localization has been associated with much debate since the advent of the general theory of relativity ( see @xcite and references therein ) . about a decade ago a renowned general relativist , h. bondi@xcite , argued that a nonlocalizable form of energy is not allowed in relativity and therefore its location can in principle be found . in a flat space - time",
    "the concept of energy localization is not controversial . in this case",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath0 satisfies the divergence relation @xmath1 .",
    "the presence of gravitation however necessitates the replacement of an ordinary derivative by a covariant one , and this leads to the covariant conservation laws @xmath2 . in a curved space - time",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of matter plus all non - gravitational fields no longer satisfies @xmath3 ; the contribution from the gravitational field is now required to construct an energy - momentum expression which satisfies a divergence relation like one has in a flat space - time .",
    "attempts aimed at obtaining a meaningful expression for energy , momentum , and angular momentum for a general relativistic system resulted in many different definitions ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "einstein s energy - momentum complex , used for calculating the energy in a general relativistic system , was followed by many prescriptions : e.g. landau and lifshitz , papapetrou and weinberg .",
    "these energy - momentum complexes restrict one to make calculations in `` cartesian coordinates '' .",
    "this shortcoming of having to single out a particular coordinate system prompted mller@xcite to construct an expression which enables one to evaluate energy in any coordinate system .",
    "mller claimed that his  expression gives the same values for the total energy and momentum as the einstein s energy - momentum complex for a closed system .",
    "however , mller s energy - momentum complex was subjected to some criticism ( see in @xcite ) .",
    "further komar@xcite formulated a new definition of energy in a curved space - time .",
    "this prescription , though not restricted to the use of `` cartesian coordinates '' , is not applicable to non - static space - times .",
    "a large number of definitions of quasi - local mass have been proposed ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the uses of quasi - local masses to obtain energy in a curved space - time are not limited to a particular coordinates system whereas many energy - momentum complexes are restricted to the use of `` cartesian coordinates . ''",
    "penrose @xcite pointed out that quasi - local masses are conceptually very important .",
    "however , inadequacies of these quasi - local masses ( these different definitions do not give agreed results for the reissner - nordstrm and kerr metrics and that the penrose definition could not succeed to deal with the kerr metric ) have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "contrary to this , virbhadra , his collaborators and others@xcite considered many asymptotically flat space - times and showed that several energy - momentum complexes give the same and acceptable results for a given space - time .",
    "further rosen and virbhadra , virbhadra , and some others carried out calculations on a few asymptotically non - flat space - times using different energy - momentum complexes and got encouraging results@xcite .",
    "@xcite proved that several energy - momentum complexes give the same result for any kerr - schild class metric .",
    "virbhadra@xcite also showed that for a general nonstatic , spherically symmetric space - time of the kerr - schild class the penrose quasilocal mass definition as well as several energy - momentum complexes yield the same results .",
    "recently , chang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that every energy - momentum complex can be associated with a particular hamiltonian boundary term .",
    "therefore the energy - momentum complexes may also be considered as quasi - local .",
    "the energy distribution in the kerr - newman space - time was earlier evaluated by cohen and de felice @xcite using komar s prescription .",
    "virbhadra@xcite showed that , up to the third order of the rotation parameter , the definitions of einstein and landau - lifshitz give the same and reasonable energy distribution in the kerr - newman ( kn ) field when calculations are carried out in kerr - schild cartesian coordinates .",
    "cooperstock and richardson @xcite extended the virbhadra energy calculations up to the seventh order of the rotation parameter and found that these definitions give the same energy distribution for the kn metric .",
    "@xcite performed exact computations for the energy distribution in kn space - time in kerr - schild cartesian coordinates .",
    "they showed that the energy distribution in the prescriptions of einstein , landau - lifshitz , papapetrou , and weinberg ( ellpw ) gave the same result .    in a recent paper lessner@xcite  in his analysis of mller s energy - momentum expression",
    "concludes that it is a powerful representation of energy and momentum in general relativity .",
    "therefore , it is interesting and important to obtain energy distribution using mller s prescription . in this paper",
    "we evaluate the energy distribution for the kn space - time in mllers@xcite prescription and compare the result with those already obtained using komar s mass as well as the ellpw energy - momentum complexes .",
    "we are also interested to check whether or not the _",
    "cooperstock hypothesis_@xcite ( which essentially states that the energy and momentum in a curved space - time are confined to the regions of non - vanishing energy - momentum tensor @xmath4 of the matter and all non - gravitational fields ) holds good for this case .",
    "we use the convention that latin indices take values from @xmath5 to @xmath6 and greek indices values from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , and take @xmath9 and @xmath10 units .",
    "the stationary axially symmetric and asymptotically flat kerr - newman solution is the most general black hole solution to the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "this describes the exterior gravitational and electromagentic field of a charged rotating object .",
    "the kerr - newman metric in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath11 is expressed by the line element    @xmath12^{2}-\\frac { \\sin ^{2}\\theta } { r_{0}^{2}}[\\left ( \\rho ^{2}+a^{2}\\right ) d\\phi -a dt]^{2}-\\frac{r_{0}^{2}}{\\delta } d\\rho ^{2}-r_{0}^{2}d\\theta ^{2}. \\label{knmetricbl}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively _ mass _ , _ electric charge _ and _ rotation _ parameters .",
    "this space - time has @xmath18 null hypersurfaces for @xmath19 , which are given by @xmath20 there is a ring curvature singularity @xmath21 in the kn space - time .",
    "this space - time has an event horizon at @xmath22 ; it describes a black hole if and only if @xmath23 .",
    "the coordinates are singular at @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 is replaced with a null coordinate @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 by the following transformation : @xmath29 and thus the kn metric is expressed in advanced eddington - finkelstein coordinates @xmath30 as @xmath31 d\\varphi^2 \\text{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    transforming the above to kerr - schild cartesian coordinates @xmath32 according to @xmath33 one has the line element @xmath34",
    "in this section we first give the energy distribution in the kn space - time obtained by some authors and then using the mller energy - momentum complex we obtain the energy distribution for the same space - time .    the energy distribution in komar s prescription obtained by cohen and de felice@xcite , using the kn metric in boyer - lindquist coordinates , is given by @xmath35 \\text{. }   \\label{ekomar}\\ ] ] ( the subscript k on the left hand side of the equation refers to komar . )",
    "aguirregabiria _ et al._@xcite studied the energy - momentum complexes of einstein , landau - lifshitz , papapetrou and weinberg for the kn metric .",
    "they showed that these definitions give the same results for the energy and energy current densities .",
    "they used the kn metric in kerr - schild cartesian coordinates .",
    "they found that these definitions give the same result for the energy distributon for the kn metric , which is expressed as @xmath36 \\text{. }   \\label{eellpw}\\ ] ] ( the subscript ellpw on the left hand side of the above equation refers to the einstein , landau - lifshitz , papapetrou and weinberg prescriptions . )",
    "it is obvious that the komar definition gives a different result for the kerr - newman metric as compared to those obtained using energy - momentum complexes of ellpw .",
    "however , for the kerr metric ( @xmath37 ) all these definitions yield the same results .",
    "these results obviously support the cooperstock hypothesis .",
    "the mller energy - momentum complex @xmath38  is given by @xcite @xmath39 satisfying the local conservation laws : @xmath40 where the antisymmetric superpotential @xmath41 is @xmath42   g^{km}g^{nl}\\text { \\ . }",
    "\\label{chi}\\ ] ] the energy and momentum components are given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the energy while @xmath45 stand for the momentum components .",
    "using gauss s theorem the energy @xmath46 for a stationary metric is thus given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the outward unit normal vector over an infinitesimal surface element @xmath49 .",
    "the only required component of @xmath50 is @xmath51 using the above expression in equation @xmath52 the energy @xmath46 inside a surface with @xmath53   is then given by @xmath54 \\text{. }    \\label{emol}\\ ] ] ( the subscript ml on the left hand side of this equation refers to mller s prescription . )",
    "our result , using mller s complex , agrees with the energy distribution obtained by cohen and de felice@xcite in komar s prescription .",
    "the second term of the energy distribution differs by a factor of two from that computed by aguirregabiria _",
    "_ using ellpw complexes . in both cases",
    "the energy is shared by both the interior and exterior of the kn black hole .",
    "it is clear that the definitions of ellpw and komar , mller s definition also upholds the cooperstock hypothesis for the kn metric .",
    "the total energy ( @xmath55 in all these energy expressions ) give the same result @xmath15 .    now defining @xmath56 the equations @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "may be expressed as @xmath60    \\label{caleellpw}\\ ] ] and @xmath61   \\text{\\ . }",

    "1 we plot @xmath64 and @xmath65 against @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "as the value of @xmath66 increases the two surfaces shown in the figure come closer .",
    "the use of the komar definition is not restricted to `` cartesian coordinates '' ( like one has for the ellpw complexes ) ; however , it is applicable only to the stationary space - times .",
    "the mller energy - momentum complex is neither restricted to the use of particular coordinates nor to the stationary space - times .",
    "lessner@xcite pointed out that the mller defintion is a powerful representation of energy and momentum in general relativity .",
    "however , one finds that for the reissner - nordstrm metric @xmath69 ( the penrose definition also gives the same result which agrees with linear theory@xcite whereas @xmath70 . therefore , one prefers the results obtained by using the definitions of etllpw .",
