    "this paper is the first in a series presenting results from a hubble space telescope ( hst ) snapshot program of nearby edge - on galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are mostly low mass , late - type spirals with circular velocities below 200 km / sec .",
    "although the project was designed to study the dust content of the galaxies , a number of the galaxies were close enough to resolve a significant population of stars and it is the resolved stars that we focus on here .",
    "previous studies of resolved stellar populations with hst have shown that they can be used to answer a variety of questions .",

    "in this paper we present the galaxies images , stellar photometry , and some initial results , including trgb distance measurements , the identification of a possible young dwarf galaxy near ngc 4631 , and the detection of lmc stars @xmath19@xmath2 away from the galaxy center . in the second paper ( paper ii , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we analyze the variation in the vertical distribution of different stellar populations and present evidence that many of these galaxies host metal - poor thick disks .",
    "first , in  2 we describe our sample , present a detailed description of our image and photometry data reduction process , and discuss the stellar models and photometric transformations we use to analyze our data . in ",
    "3 we present images and color magnitude diagrams of each galaxy and identify the visible stellar populations . we also identify a candidate dwarf galaxy lying just off the plane of ngc 4631 , which appears to contain only young stars . our method and results for trgb distance determination are discussed in  4 and conclusions follow in  5 .",
    "our sample consists of 16 galaxies observed with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) as part of an hst cycle 12 snapshot project ( pi : de jong , pid : 9765 ) .",

    ", we expect to find that approximately 1.5% of pixels ( @xmath1300,000 pixels in our final 4350@xmath84350 images ) are affected by cosmic rays .",

    "we therefore adopted the same la_cosmic idl code for our data reduction .",
    "however , we found two problems when the method was applied to our data .",
    "first , while the code appeared to be very effective at removing cosmic rays , there were also a significant number of obvious false detections in high brightness regions .",
    "second , we found that removed cosmic rays still left small halos behind . to address the false detections we set very stringent limits for what was counted as a cosmic ray ( sigclip=6 , objlim=8 ) . to remove the residual halos",
    ", we expanded the cosmic ray removal to the four nearest neighbors of a detected cosmic ray .",
    "although this undoubtedly removed some pixels unaffected by crs it also eliminated all signs of the halos around removed crs . in total , the altered la_cosmic routine resulted in the removal and interpolation over @xmath1150,000 pixels per science image in the flt files .",
    "however it also left behind some obvious cosmic ray features .",
    "we note that when we had only one exposure in a filter , we used less stringent parameters for selecting cosmic rays , which may have resulted in the removal of real sources .",
    "however , these images were not used for source detections so the only affect of this would be occasionally spurious photometric results .",
    "the remaining cosmic rays were removed in the drizzling process .",
    "we ran the pyraf multidrizzle task to create 4350 @xmath8 4350 pixel images . due to our crowded fields ,",
    "the default sky subtraction produced obvious mismatches in sky brightness between chip quadrants , requiring us to use skytype=single , which applies a single sky value to each ccd image .",
    "we also found determining the sky value using the mode ( skystat=mode ) rather than using the median ( which is the default ) , gave better matched sky values . despite these measures ,",
    "some of our most crowded fields ( e.g. ngc 4631 ) show a slight mismatch in sky brightness between the two ccds .",
    "this should not affect the identification or photometry of stars in these images because both use locally determined sky values . comparing the median , crreject and minmed modes of image combination",
    ", we found the default median mode surprisingly yielded the best results for cosmic ray removal .",
    "the lanczos3 kernel was used for creating the final images with a pixel scale of 0.05 arcseconds .",
    "we found that the lanczos3 kernel gave a sharper image than the default square kernel .",
    "specifically , within a two pixel aperture , stars in an image made with the lanczos3 kernel had @xmath15% more flux than in an image made with a square kernel . for apertures larger than four pixels ,",
    "fluxes in the two images were the same .",
    "all further analysis is done with the final , drizzled images .",
    "all of the galaxies in the sample show a resolved stellar component .",
    "individual stars were detected using the find routine in daophot ii @xcite with a threshold of 5@xmath9 over the local background .",
    "the routine initially returned anywhere from 15,000 sources in iras  06070 - 6147 to 400,000 sources in ngc  55 .",
    "the final number of sources , shown in table  3 , count only sources detected in both filters .",
    "for the 1@xmath82 fields , we detected objects only in the f814w filter and then used that source list for both filters .",
    "we performed aperture photometry using the phot routine with an aperture of 4 pixels and a sky annulus between 11 and 14 pixels .",
    "we then compiled the photometry in both filters and required objects be detected independently in both filters for the 2@xmath82 fields .",
    "this reduced the number of objects by 40 - 75% from the original source lists .",
    "we note that there was a @xmath10.3 pixel positional offset between the f606w and f814w drizzled images in all the observations . after correcting for this offset we matched objects within 1 pixel of eachother in the two filters . in the very small number of cases where",
    "more than one source was found within one pixel , the brighter match was used .",
    "as noted above , in the 1@xmath82 fields , sources were found only in the f814w band  the positions from the f814w image were then used for both filters to determine the aperture magnitudes .",
    "we transformed all of our photometric data to the vegamag system using provided zeropoints ( acs isr 2004 - 8 , de marchi et al . ) and aperture corrections ( m. sirianni , private communication ) .",
    "the zeropoints provided are for an infinite aperture and the aperture corrections give the aperture correction from a 10 pixel to infinite aperture .",
    "we derived a correction from a 4 to 10 pixel aperture using isolated bright stars from the 2@xmath82 fields .",
    "the resulting corrections showed very little ( @xmath100.01 mag . ) scatter and are shown in table  4 along with the zeropoints and 10@xmath11 aperture corrections .",

    "to improve the photometry , we modeled the psf in our drizzled fields . an adequate model for the acs / wfc psf must allow for spatial variations of the psf over the wide field of view .",
    "fortunately , daophot ii has the capability to model the psf as a combination of an analytical function and empirical sub - pixel corrections that depend quadratically on the position in the field .",
    "initially we attempted to model the psf in each field independently , but found that the derived psfs were greatly limited by the small numbers of bright , isolated stars ( typically 50 ) available in the large 4350@xmath84350 pixel frames .",
    "instead we assumed that the psf was roughly constant over the course of our observations and constructed a patchwork image in each filter using bright , isolated stars from the 2@xmath82 fields .",
    "the resulting images contained @xmath1700 stars and enabled more accurate determination of the spatial variation of the psf . out of the options given by daophot",
    "ii , the best fitting analytical functions in both filters were moffat functions , @xmath13 . in the f606w filter , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , while in f814w @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the fwhm of these analytical functions is 0.86 pixels ( 0.043 arcsec ) in f606w and 0.97 pixels ( 0.049 arcsec ) in f814w .",
    "based on a comparison between a variable and constant psf , the spatial corrections in our psf affect the photometry by at most 0.03 magnitudes .",
    "the correction of psf magnitudes to 10 pixel aperture photometry is given in table  4 .",
    "the accuracy of these corrections is @xmath10.03 magnitudes .",
    "we treat this as a systematic error , and do not include it in individual errors of the stars .",
    "the computed psf has a radius of 7 pixels ( 0.35 arcsec ) .",
    "figure  1a shows the resulting psf magnitude color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for the ngc  55-disk field .",
    "the ngc  55-disk field cmd is the cleanest of our cmds due to the galaxy s proximity and the field s relative lack of dust .",
    "the clear features seen in this cmd , which will be discussed in  3 , demonstrate the quality of our photometry .      to assess the completeness limit as a function of position , magnitude , and color",
    ", we inserted large numbers of artificial stars in our images and then attempted to recover them with our data reduction pipeline .",
    "these stars were input in grids separated by 20 pixels with an overall random position offset . in this way , @xmath138,000 stars were added to a field , each with a random f606w vegamag between 18 and 29 and a f606w - f814w color between -1.0 and 3.0 .",
    "we then ran the stars through a pipeline identical to the one outlined above for finding stars and determining their photometry .",
    "this was done with different random position offsets to generate as many as four million artificial stars distributed throughout each field .",
    "the large computing time required to run these tests was enabled through use of the distributed computing system , condor .",
    "figure  2 shows the completeness as a function of scale height in ngc  4244 for stars at a variety of magnitudes .",
    "away from the plane of the galaxy , in a non - crowded area , the 50% completeness level of our data is @xmath127 mag in f606w and @xmath126 mag in f814w .",
    "however , the crowding in the midplane of the galaxy drastically reduces the completeness , by as much as 35% at moderate magnitudes .",
    "note that figure  2 contains the results from artificial stars of all colors , but for a specific range in color the completness can be higher or lower .",
    "for instance , the f814w 50% completeness in non - crowded areas at f606w - f814w between -1 and 1 is @xmath126.5 , but rises steeply at redder colors .",
    "figure  3 shows a typical 20% completeness line as a function of color in each of the color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "the scatter from galaxy to galaxy in the completeness values is a few tenths of a magnitude .",
    "critical to the interpretation of our data is the ability to connect the acs vega magnitude system for the f606w and f814w filters with existing stellar models and previous data .",
    "we rely on two sources for performing this photometric transformation .",
    "first , we used a set of the padova isochrones and single stellar population models transformed into the acs vegamag system using synthetic spectra and acs / wfc instrument response ( l. girardi , private communication ) .",
    "these models are the standard @xcite isochrones with tracks at z=0.0001 , 0.0004 , 0.001 , 0.004 , 0.008 , & 0.019 ( [ fe / h]=-2.3 , -1.7 , -1.3 , -0.7 , -0.4 , 0.0 ) with ages between 4 myr and 18 gyr .",
    "second , in very limited cases , we used transformations from the acs vegamag system to johnson v & i provided by m. sirianni ( private communication ) .",
    "however , these transformations are potentially inaccurate as they attempt to infer the spectrum of a star from limited color information and are valid only for -0.5@xmath10v - i@xmath102.3 .",
    "the vegamag f606w - f814w color is similar to johnson v - i , but has a somewhat smaller wavelength span , meaning that the differences in color are somewhat more moderate .",
    "for instance , red giant branch stars are @xmath10.3 magnitudes bluer in f606w - f814w [ vegamag ] than in v - i . unless explicitly stated otherwise , all magnitudes in the paper are in the vegamag system .",
    "in the sample as a whole we have determined photometry for over 1.2 million objects ( see table  3 ) , a vast majority of which are stars in the sample galaxies .",
    "figure  3 shows images and color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of each of the galaxies .",
    "the cmds show all the stars detected in each field . of all the cmds in our sample , the ngc  55-disk cmd reaches the faintest absolute magnitudes . in figure",
    "1b we illustrate the distinct features visible in its cmd .",
    "many of the other cmds in figure  3 share these features at fainter apparent magnitudes .",
    "these visible features are due to the following stellar populations :    * main sequence ( ms ) - at the bright absolute magnitudes at which we are observing ( m@xmath18 ) , ms stars are younger than a few 100 myr . at the bright end , the ms and blue helium burning sequence overlap . *",
    "red and blue helium burning sequences ( rheb and bheb ) - these sequences contain young massive stars undergoing core helium burning .",
    "along both these sequences , the ages and masses of the stars are proportional to the luminosity , with younger , more massive stars populating the bright end .",
    "the faintest stars along the rheb have an age of @xmath1200 myr , while the bheb branch extends down to @xmath1600 myr @xcite . * asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) - the agb contains stars of intermediate age , after completion of their core - helium burning stage .",
    "the observed portion of the agb is brighter and redder than the rgb .",
    "based on the girardi isochrones , the agb stars observed here mostly have metallicities between [ fe / h]=-0.7 and 0.0 and ages between 100 myr and a few gyr . at absolute magnitudes fainter than the red giant branch tip m@xmath19",
    "the agb stars can not be distinguished from the rgb stars * red giant branch ( rgb ) - the rgb is dominated by old stars undergoing shell - hydrogen burning .",
    "these stars have ages @xmath20 gyr and represent the oldest of the components visible in our cmds .",
    "the exact position of the rgb depends primarily on metallicity , with more metal - rich stars being redder and fainter in our cmds .",
    "inspection of figure  3 shows that most of these components are clearly visible in ic 2233 , ic 5052 , ngc 55 ( both fields ) , ngc 4144 , ngc 4244 , ngc 4631-disk , and ngc 5023 .",
    "these cmds clearly show evidence for both young and old stellar populations .",
    "the effects of dust are also obvious when comparing the color magnitude diagrams of the central ngc 55 and ngc 4631 fields with those taken further out in the disk ( ngc 55-disk and ngc 4631-disk ) . in both cases",

    "these stars fit well to isochrones with a distance modulus of 18.5 @xcite , an age of a few gyr , and metallicities of [ fe / h]=-0.4 to 0.0 .",
    "this provides a serendiptous confirmation of the accuracy of our photometric calibration and isochrone bandpass transformation .",

    "this dwarf may have been previously discovered by @xcite with the name ngp9  f268 - 1993301 using poss - i plates .",
    "however , their position ( @xmath23=12h41m49.89s @xmath24-+32@xmath253100.5 , shown with an x in fig .  4 ) and red color ( o - e@xmath12 ) suggests that they suffered from confusion with the bright red star ( most likely a foreground object ) seen to the lower left of the circle in figure  4 .",
    "the left panel of figure  5 shows the color - magnitude diagram of the stars in the circle shown in figure  4 . for comparison , we show a field cmd at the same height above the plane of ngc 4631 but offset in the longitudinal direction .",

    "we find 26 stars bluer than f606w - f814w=0.3 associated with the dwarf , but only 15 in the entire area outside the dwarf .",
    "this gives an expected rate @xmath10.8 stars bluer than f606w - f814w=0.3 in the field of the dwarf , implying that the dwarf has a @xmath030 times overdensity of blue stars .",
    "by contrast , the expected rate for stars redder than f606w - f814w of 0.3 in the field of the dwarf is @xmath150 stars , while the dwarf contains only 47 .",
    "this suggests that if any old population exists , it is small enough to contain few stars near the tip of the rgb .",
    "the good fit of the isochrone shown in figure  5 to the blue stars and the bright red stars ( probably rheb stars ) in the dwarf suggests an age of @xmath130 myr .",
    "we found that isochrones with a wide range of metallicities and ages between 10 - 50 myr can also fit the data quite well .",
    "these tests also suggest that the dwarf is located at the same distance modulus ( assumed to be 29.42 ) as ngc 4631 .",
    "we can also calculate the integrated magnitudes of ngc  4631  dwa to compare to single stellar population models .",
    "the total flux from the dwarf is measured by aperture photometry using an aperture of 4.5@xmath26 and a sky annulus between 5@xmath26 and 6 .",
    "the contribution from ngc 4631 s field stars is then determined by finding the flux using the same aperture and sky annulus at 100 random positions with the same height above the plane , but avoiding ngc  4631  dwa and the bright star visible just to it s lower left in figure  4 .",
    "the mean of these we use as a background and the standard deviation is the error in this background .",
    "the final flux for the dwarf is determined by subtracting off the background and the final error combines the dwarf s error in the flux with the error in the background . using this error and",

    "we note that despite being rather uncertain , the f606w - f814w color of 0.4 matches the expected value from this single stellar population , suggesting that any existing older population does not make a significant contribution to the total luminosity of ngc  4631  dwa .",
    "the dwarf s absolute magnitude , m@xmath30 is only slightly brighter than the recently discovered faintest galaxy andromeda ix @xcite .",

    "however its location @xmath12 kpc above the disk makes it unusual .",
    "if the object is indeed bound it would have a circular velocity of @xmath17 km / sec .",
    "however given that the only stars we see are young , it is possible that it is an unbound and gradually dissolving object .",
    "one possible explanation for the creation of this object is that it is caused by a condensation of gas interacting with ngc 4631 .",
    "figures 4 and 5 of @xcite show five hi spurs surrounding ngc 4631 .",
    "although none of their positions overlap with the position of the dwarf , two spurs meet up with the disk at a position just opposite the dwarf .",
    "this explanation for the formation of the object would make it akin to young tidal dwarf galaxies and clusters observed in the tails of interacting galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
