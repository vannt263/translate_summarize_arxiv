    "small covers are a class of particularly nicely behaving manifolds @xmath4 , introduced by davis and januszkiewicz @xcite , each of which is an @xmath5-dimensional closed manifold with a locally standard @xmath6-action such that its orbit space is a simple convex @xmath5-polytope @xmath7 .",
    "there are strong links of small covers with combinatorics and polytopes .",
    "davis and januszkiewicz showed that small covers have very beautifully algebraic topology .",
    "for example , the equivariant cohomology of a small cover @xmath8 is exactly isomorphic to the stanley - reisner face ring of @xmath7 , and the mod 2 betti numbers @xmath9 of @xmath10 agree with the @xmath11-vector @xmath12 of @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , they also showed that each small cover @xmath8 determines a characteristic function @xmath13 ( here we call it a @xmath6-coloring ) on @xmath7 , defined by mapping all facets ( i.e. , @xmath14-dimensional faces ) of @xmath7 to nonzero elements of @xmath6 such that @xmath5 facets meeting at each vertex are mapped to @xmath5 linearly independent elements , and conversely , up to equivariant homeomorphism , @xmath10 can be reconstructed from the pair @xmath15 .",
    "more specifically , take a point @xmath16 in the boundary @xmath17 , then there must be a @xmath18-dimensional face @xmath19 of @xmath7 such that @xmath16 is in the relative interior of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . since @xmath7 is simple ( i.e. , the number of facets meeting at each vertex is exactly @xmath5 ) , there are @xmath21 facets @xmath22 such that @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the rank-@xmath25 subgroup of @xmath26 determined by @xmath27 .",
    "then we can define an equivalence relation @xmath28 on the product bundle @xmath29 as follows : @xmath30 furthermore , the quotient space @xmath31 denoted by @xmath32 recovers @xmath10 up to equivariant homeomorphism .",
    "geometrically , @xmath32 is exactly obtained by gluing @xmath33 copies of @xmath7 along their boundaries by using @xmath6-coloring @xmath13 .",
    "this reconstruction of small covers provides a way of studying closed manifolds by using @xmath6-colored polytopes .",
    ".2 cm in @xcite , izmestiev studied a class of 3-dimensional small covers such that each @xmath13 of @xmath0-colorings on their orbit spaces is 3-colorable ( i.e. , the image of @xmath13 contains only three linearly independent elements of @xmath0 ) .",
    "such a class of small covers are  pullbacks from the linear model \" in the terminology of davis and januszkiewicz .",
    "izmestiev obtained a classification result , saying that every such small cover can be produced from finitely many 3-dimensional tori with the canonical @xmath0-action under the equivariant connected sum and the equivariant dehn surgery .",
    ".1 cm    in this paper , we shall consider all possible 3-dimensional small covers .",
    "our objective is to determine the ( equivariant ) topological types of such a class of 3-dimensional manifolds .",
    "four color theorem guarantees that each simple convex 3-polytope always admits a @xmath0-coloring .",
    "thus , by the reconstruction of small covers , simple convex 3-polytopes with @xmath0-colorings can recover all 3-dimensional small covers , so all simple convex 3-polytopes will be involved in studying 3-dimensional small covers . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the convention that if two simple convex polytopes @xmath34 and @xmath35 are combinatorially equivalent , then @xmath34 is identified with @xmath35 .",
    ".2 cm    let @xmath36 denote the set of all pairs @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a simple convex 3-polytope and @xmath13 is a @xmath0-coloring on it , and let @xmath39 denote the set of all 3-dimensional small covers .",
    "then , there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath36 and @xmath39 by mapping @xmath37 to @xmath40 .",
    "there is a natural action of @xmath41 on @xmath36 , defined by the correspondence @xmath42 where @xmath43 . obviously , this action is free , and it also induces an action of @xmath41 on @xmath39 by mapping @xmath44 to @xmath45 . both @xmath46 and @xmath45 are @xmath47-equivariantly homeomorphic ( cf @xcite ) , so they are homeomorphic by forgetting their @xmath0-actions .",

    "this is an equivariant analogue of a well - known result ( @xcite , @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite ) as follows : `` each closed 3-manifold can be obtained from a 3-sphere @xmath87 or a @xmath87 with one non - orientable bundle by using a finite number of dehn surgeries '' .",
    "as an application , we study the @xmath0-equivariant unoriented cobordism classification of all 3-dimensional small covers .",
    "let @xmath88 denote the set of @xmath0-equivariant unoriented cobordism classes of all 3-dimensional small covers .",
    "then @xmath88 forms an abelian group under disjoint union , so it is also a vector space over @xmath89 .",
    "[ t3 ] @xmath88 is generated by classes of @xmath1 and @xmath85 with certain @xmath0-actions .",
    "it should be pointed out that theorem  [ t3 ] is a direct corollary of main theorems in @xcite , but here we shall give it a different proof . actually , the first author of this paper in @xcite dealt with general closed 3-manifolds with effective @xmath90-actions .",
    "let @xmath91 be the @xmath89-vector space consisting of @xmath0-equivariant unoriented cobordism classes of all closed 3-manifolds with effective @xmath90-actions .",
    "then it was shown in @xcite that @xmath91 can be generated by classes of @xmath1 and @xmath85 with certain @xmath0-actions , and each class of @xmath91 contains a small cover as its representative .",

    ", we consider the @xmath0-equivariant unoriented cobordism classification of all 3-dimensional small covers and prove theorem  [ t3 ] in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "the task of this section is to define six operations on @xmath36 . throughout the remaining part of this paper , each nonzero element of @xmath0",
    "is called a _ color _ , so @xmath0 contains seven colors .",
    ".1 cm    first , let us look at all simple uncolored 3-polytopes .",
    "it is well - known that any simple convex 3-polytope can be obtained from a 3-simplex by using three types of _ excision _ methods illustrated in the following figure : cutting out ( i ) a vertex ; ( ii ) an edge ; ( iii ) two edges with a common vertex .",
    "see grnbaum s",
    "book @xcite .",
    "@xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 since we shall carry out our study on colored polytopes and small covers , although these three types of excisions are very simple , they can not directly work on colored polytopes and small covers because they will destroy the closedness of small covers .",
    "however , for our purpose we can interpret them as the connected sumoperations with some standard simple @xmath95-polytopes as follows .      1 .",
    "the operation @xmath73 with a 3-simplex @xmath62 @xmath96 2 .   the operation @xmath74 with a 3-sided prism @xmath63 @xmath97 3 .",

    "also , we always can do the operation @xmath73 between any two simple 3-polytopes .",
    "since a 3-sided prism and a truncated prism can be obtained from a 3-simplex by using the operation @xmath73 , we have    [ non - coloring ] each simple 3-polytope can be obtained from a 3-simplex under three operations @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath38 be a simple 3-polytope , and let @xmath101 be a facet of @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath101 is a @xmath102-polygon where @xmath103 .",
    "if @xmath104 , then @xmath101 is called a _ small facet _ ; otherwise , it is called a _",
    "big facet_.    also , for two edges with a common vertex in a simple 3-polytope @xmath38 , denoted by @xmath105 , there are at least four neighboring facets around @xmath105 .",
    "but it is easy to see that there are exactly five neighboring facets around @xmath105 if @xmath105 is not in a triangular facet .",
    "since @xmath105 is always associated with the operation @xmath52 , throughout the rest of the paper , we use the _ convention _ that @xmath105 must be chosen in an @xmath106-polygonal facet with @xmath107 , so there are five neighboring facets around @xmath105",
    ".    .2 cm    suppose that @xmath38 is a simple 3-polytope but it is not a 3-simplex .",
    "then we know by proposition  [ non - coloring ] that @xmath38 comes from applying one of the three types of cutting operations on some simple 3-polytope @xmath108 such that the number of facets of @xmath108 is one less than that of @xmath38 . in other words , there is a small facet @xmath101 of @xmath38 such that @xmath108 is obtained by compressing @xmath101 into a point , or an edge or a @xmath105 in @xmath38 . in this case",
    ", we say that @xmath38 is _ compressible at @xmath101 _ , and @xmath108 is the _ compression of @xmath38 at @xmath101_.    suppose that @xmath38 is a simple 3-polytope other than a 3-simplex .",
    "then @xmath38 is always compressible at some small facet .",
    ".2 cm    now let us carry out our work on @xmath36 .",
    "we wish to know how the three operations @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath52 work on @xmath36 . to make our language more concise ,",
    "first let us give some notions .",
    "[ local colorings ] given a pair @xmath109 in @xmath36 .",

    "since @xmath38 is simple , and the colors of these four facets are said to be a _ coloring of @xmath111_. similarly , for a @xmath105 in @xmath38 , there are five neighboring facets around @xmath105 , and then the colors of those facets are said to be a _ coloring of @xmath105_.    [ local coloring ] by the definition of @xmath0-colorings , the colors of neighboring facets around a vertex ( resp . an edge and a @xmath105 ) always can span the whole @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to see that up to @xmath112-equivalence , a vertex admits a unique coloring , an edge admits four different kinds of colorings , and a @xmath105 admits 16 different kinds of colorings .",
    "we list them as follows :    1 .",
    "colorings of a vertex and an edge @xmath113 2 .",
    "colorings of a @xmath105 @xmath114 @xmath115    given a pair @xmath109 in @xmath36 , and let @xmath101 be a facet of @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath101 is said to be _",
    "2-independent _ if the colors of the neighboring facets around @xmath101 span a 2-dimensional subspace of @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , @xmath101 is said to be _",
    "3-independent _ if the colors of the neighboring facets around @xmath101 span the whole @xmath0 .    with the above understood ,",
    "let us look at how the three operations @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath52 work on @xmath36 .",
    "[ operation-1 ] up to @xmath50-equivalence , the first two operations @xmath73 and @xmath74 can operate on any vertex and any edge in a colored simple 3-polytope , respectively , and the third operation @xmath52 can operate on @xmath105 in a colored simple 3-polytope as long as the coloring of @xmath105 does not match any one of eight kinds of colorings shown in the figures ( e)-(g ) of remark  [ local coloring](2 ) .    let @xmath37 be a pair in @xmath36 .",
    "choose a vertex @xmath110 of @xmath38 , since @xmath110 admits a unique coloring up to @xmath56-equivalence , there is a pair @xmath116 such that some vertex in @xmath62 has the same coloring as @xmath110 , so that we can do the operation @xmath73 between @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "choose an edge @xmath111 of @xmath38 , then we know from remark  [ local coloring](1 ) that there are four kinds of colorings of @xmath111 up to @xmath56-equivalence , which agree with those colorings of an edge @xmath119 of @xmath63 , as shown in section 1 , where @xmath119 is not an edge of any triangle facet of @xmath63 .",
    "thus , we can perform the operation @xmath74 on @xmath37 with some pair @xmath120 .",
    "choose a @xmath105 ( i.e. , two edges with a common vertex ) in some facet @xmath101 of @xmath38 ( note that @xmath101 is an @xmath106-polygon with @xmath121 by our convention as before ) .",
    "we know from remark  [ local coloring](2 ) that there are 16 kinds of colorings of @xmath105 up to @xmath56-equivalence . however , it is easy to see that the eight kinds of colorings shown in the figures ( e)-(g ) can not be used as colorings of the neighboring facets around a pentagon in a simple 3-polytope by the definition of @xmath0-colorings .",
    "this means that if @xmath105 has such a coloring , we can not perform the operation @xmath52 on @xmath37 at @xmath105 . on the other hand , consider a @xmath122 in a truncated prism as shown in the following figure : @xmath123 obviously , @xmath122 admits those eight kinds of colorings shown in the figures ( a)-(d ) of remark  [ local coloring](2 ) , but it admits none of eight kinds of colorings shown in the figures ( e)-(g ) of remark  [ local coloring](2 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath37 can do the operation @xmath52 with a @xmath98 with some @xmath0-coloring if @xmath105 admits a coloring which matches one of the eight kinds of colorings shown in the figures ( a)-(d ) of remark  [ local coloring](2 ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that @xmath73 can always operate between any two pairs @xmath124 and @xmath125 in @xmath36 up to @xmath50-equivalence .",
    "in fact , choose two vertices @xmath126 and @xmath127 in @xmath34 and @xmath128 respectively , then @xmath126 and @xmath127 have the same coloring up to @xmath50-equivalence .",
    "thus , by applying an automorphism @xmath129 to @xmath130 , we can change the coloring of @xmath126 into that of @xmath127 , so that we can do the operation @xmath73 between @xmath131 and @xmath125 .",
    "we shall see that @xmath73 exactly agrees with the equivariant connected sum of 3-dimensional small covers .    similarly to the uncolored case",
    ", clearly we still can not perform the corresponding inverse operations of @xmath132 on colored @xmath62 , @xmath63,@xmath98 , respectively .",
    "however , by remark  [ local coloring ] , it is easy to see that for any small facet @xmath101 of a pair @xmath37 , if @xmath101 is 2-independent , then @xmath37 can not be compressed at @xmath101 .",
    ".2 cm    by proposition  [ non - coloring ] , a natural question is whether each pair @xmath117 of @xmath36 can be produced only from a 3-simplex with @xmath0-colorings in such three operations .",
    "however , generally the answer is _",
    "no_. for example , none of the four colorings on @xmath63 as shown in section 1 can be obtained from a 3-simplex with @xmath0-colorings under three operations @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath52 .",
    "this is because each triangular facet in @xmath63 with any one of those four colorings is 2-independent and it can not be compressed into a point .",
    "more generally , we can further ask the following question :    1 .",
    "_ can any pair @xmath117 be produced by a @xmath95-simplex , a prism and a truncated prism with @xmath0-colorings under operations @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath52 ? _",
    "unfortunately , the answer is still _",
    "no_. actually , generally it is possible that all the small facets are 2-independent , so we can not do the compression of @xmath37 at any of its small facets at all .",
    "this can be seen from the following example .",
    "consider two copies of a square with four neighboring 6-polygons , we can glue them into a simple 3-polytope admitting a 3-colorable coloring , as shown in the following figure : @xmath133 however , this 3-colorable example can not be compressed at any facet under operations @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath52 since each coloring on a 3-simplex ( resp .",
    "a 3-sided prism , and a truncated prism ) is not 3-colorable .",
    "generally , when a pair @xmath37 of @xmath36 is 3-colorable , a theorem of izmestiev in @xcite claims that @xmath37 can be obtained from a finite set of 3-colorable cubes by using the equivariant connected sum ( i.e. , the operation @xmath73 ) and the equivariant dehn surgery .",
    "the reason why his work was carried out very well is because the coloring of a @xmath95-colorable polytope is unique up to @xmath50-equivalence , while generally speaking , the set of all colorings given by more than three colors is quite complicated .",
    "according to the work of izmestiev ( @xcite ) , we might need the fourth operation @xmath53 on @xmath36 .",
    "this operation originally comes from the dehn surgery on 3-manifolds rather than combinatorics . based upon the topological meaning of dehn surgery",
    ", izmestiev gave it a combinatorial description by deleting a quarter of a cylinder with a subsequent gluing of a half - cylinder .",
    "although this combinatorial description of the operation @xmath53 works on @xmath36 very well , it does nt meet the style of this paper , that is , it does not accord with the descriptions of other operations on @xmath36 in this paper .",
    "for this , we give another combinatorial description of this operation @xmath53 , which is shown as follows : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is a quarter of a 3-ball , whose boundary consists of three 2-polygons , three edges and two vertices .",
    "clearly @xmath136 is not a simple 3-polytope , but it still admits a @xmath0-coloring . note that @xmath136 is actually a nice manifold with corners ( @xcite ) .",
    "obviously , the operation @xmath53 is invertible .",
    "however , generally it may not be closed in @xmath36 because doing the operation @xmath53 on a colored 3-polytope @xmath37 might destroy the 3-connectedness of the 1-skeleton of @xmath38 . in the 3-colorable case",
    ", izmestiev showed that if @xmath53 makes the 1-skeleton of the polytope not @xmath95-connected , then one can find a connected sum somewhere else in the original polytope . in the general case , the argument of izmestiev can be carried out to get a generalized result .",
    "the following is the combinatorial lemma proved by izmestiev in @xcite which will be used later in this paper .",
    "[ @xcite ] if the 1-skeleton of a 3-polytope @xmath137 is disconnected after cutting out three non - adjacent edges , then @xmath137 can be written as @xmath138 , where @xmath139 are 3-polytopes .",
    "in addition , when @xmath137 is simple , so are @xmath140 and @xmath141 .    next , given a pair @xmath37 in @xmath36 , suppose that we can do an equivariant dehn surgery on @xmath37 , but this operation destroys the 3-connectedness of the 1-skeleton @xmath142 of @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath13 is 3-colorable , izmestiev gave a canonical method of finding three non - adjacent edges @xmath143 of @xmath38 such that @xmath144 is disconnected ( see @xcite for the argument in detail ) .",

    "furthermore , one can compress @xmath101 into a point .",
    "if @xmath183 is 2-independent and @xmath184 , then one can compress @xmath101 into an edge along @xmath178 ; if @xmath183 is 2-independent but @xmath185 , then one can first change the coloring of @xmath183 into @xmath186 by the operation @xmath55 , so that one can also compress @xmath101 into an edge along @xmath178 .",

    ", we can change the coloring of a small facet , say @xmath101 , then the adjacent small facets around @xmath101 become @xmath95-independent .",
    "then we can compress them by using operations @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath52 .",
    "we note that the edge number of the big facet will be reduced while we compress its neighboring triangular facets , and this number will be either reduced or unchanged while we compress its neighboring rectangular facets , but this number will be unchanged or reduced or becoming bigger while we compress its neighboring pentagonal facets , as shown in the following figure : @xmath206 in particular , when we compress 3-independent pentagons , it is possible to produce new big facets .",
    "for example , if @xmath183 is a pentagon in the above figure , then it will become a big facet after compressing @xmath207 .",
    "in addition , it is easy to see that compressing rectangles and pentagons may lead to the adjacency of big facets .",
    "if this happens , we can return to the case ( a ) to do dehn surgeries .",
    "otherwise , by changing the colorings of small facets and compressing them , we can carry on our work to reduce the edge numbers of big facets .",
    ".2 cm    these alternate processes above can always end in finite steps since the number of facets of @xmath38 is finite . note that with the help of @xmath55 , five operations @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 can not only decrease the number of facets , but they can also decrease the edge numbers of big facets .",
    ".2 cm on the other hand , we see that the six operations themselves also involve some special colored blocks . specifically , when doing three operations @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath52 , the colored @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath98 are involved ;",
    "when doing the operation @xmath53 , the pair @xmath208 is involved . as seen above , using the equivariant dehn surgery @xmath53 , we can avoid changing the colorings of big facets .",
    "so the special colored blocks involved in the operation @xmath55 are only those colored @xmath209-sided prisms @xmath210 with top and bottom facets differently colored and being both 2-independent where @xmath211 .",

    "furthermore , by reversing the induction process , eventually @xmath37 can be described as an expression of those colored blocks @xmath62 , @xmath98 , @xmath210 @xmath212 , and @xmath135 under the six operations .    .2 cm    next , to complete the proof , let us make a further analysis for those colored blocks @xmath62 , @xmath98 , @xmath210 @xmath212 , and @xmath135",

    "notice that the connected sums @xmath73 of a colored @xmath62 with some vertex of the top facet of a colored @xmath63 and with some vertex of the bottom facet of a colored @xmath63 respectively may produce different colorings of @xmath98 .",
