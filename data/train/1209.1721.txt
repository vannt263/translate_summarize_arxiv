    "every algorithm of this type has an interval version .",
    "the complexity of this interval version coincides with the complexity of the initial algorithm .",
    "the interval version of an algorithm of this type gives exact interval estimates for the corresponding output data .",
    "algorithms of linear algebra over idempotent and semirings are examined . in this case ,",

    "idempotent analysis deals with functions taking their values in an idempotent semiring and the corresponding function spaces .",
    "idempotent analysis was initially constructed by v.  p.  maslov and his collaborators and then developed by many authors .",

    "@xmath45 : by definition , @xmath46 if and only if @xmath47 . if the zero element exists , then all elements of @xmath31 are nonnegative : @xmath48 @xmath49 for all @xmath50 . due to the existence of this order , idempotent analysis",
    "is closely related to the lattice theory , theory of vector lattices , and theory of ordered spaces . moreover , this partial order allows to model a number of basic `` topological '' concepts and results of idempotent analysis at the purely algebraic level ; this line of reasoning was examined systematically in  @xcite  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "calculus deals mainly with functions whose values are numbers .",
    "the idempotent analog of a numerical function is a map @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is an arbitrary set and @xmath31 is an idempotent semiring .",
    "functions with values in @xmath31 can be added , multiplied by each other , and multiplied by elements of @xmath31 pointwise .",
    "the idempotent analog of a linear functional space is a set of @xmath31-valued functions that is closed under addition of functions and multiplication of functions by elements of @xmath31 , or an @xmath31-semimodule .",
    "consider , e.g. , the @xmath31-semimodule @xmath53 of all functions @xmath51 that are bounded in the sense of the standard order on @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath54 , then the idempotent analog of integration is defined by the formula @xmath55 where @xmath56 . indeed , a riemann sum of the form @xmath57 corresponds to the expression @xmath58 , which tends to the right - hand side of  ( 1 ) as @xmath59 .",
    "of course , this is a purely heuristic argument .",
    "formula  ( 1 ) defines the _ idempotent _ ( or _ maslov _ ) _ integral _ not only for functions taking values in @xmath60 , but also in the general case when any of bounded ( from above ) subsets of  @xmath31 has the least upper bound .",
    "an _ idempotent _ ( or _ maslov _ ) _ measure _ on @xmath52 is defined by the formula @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a fixed function .",
    "the integral with respect to this measure is defined by the formula @xmath63    obviously , if @xmath64 , then the standard order is opposite to the conventional order @xmath65 , so in this case equation  ( 2 ) assumes the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is understood in the sense of the conventional order @xmath65 .",
    "basic equations of quantum theory are linear ; this is the superposition principle in quantum mechanics .",
    "the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation , the basic equation of classical mechanics , is nonlinear in the conventional sense .",
    "however , it is linear over the semirings @xmath60 and @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , different versions of the bellman equation , the basic equation of optimization theory , are linear over suitable idempotent semirings ; this is v.  p.  maslov s idempotent superposition principle , see @xcite .",
    "for instance , the finite - dimensional stationary bellman equation can be written in the form @xmath69 , where @xmath52 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 are matrices with coefficients in an idempotent semiring @xmath31 and the unknown matrix @xmath52 is determined by @xmath70 and @xmath71  @xcite . in particular , standard problems of dynamic programming and the well - known shortest path problem correspond to the cases @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "it is known that principal optimization algorithms for finite graphs correspond to standard methods for solving systems of linear equations of this type ( i.e. , over semirings ) .",
    "specifically , bellman s shortest path algorithm corresponds to a version of jacobi s algorithm , ford s algorithm corresponds to the gauss ",
    "seidel iterative scheme , etc .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the linearity of the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation over @xmath68 and @xmath60 , which is the result of the maslov dequantization of the schrdinger equation , is closely related to the ( conventional ) linearity of the schrdinger equation and can be deduced from this linearity .",
    "thus , it is possible to borrow standard ideas and methods of linear analysis and apply them to a new area .",
    "consider a classical dynamical system specified by the hamiltonian @xmath74 where @xmath75 are generalized coordinates , @xmath76 are generalized momenta , @xmath77 are generalized masses , and @xmath78 is the potential . in this case",
    "the lagrangian @xmath79 has the form @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "the value function @xmath83 of the action functional has the form @xmath84 where the integration is performed along the factual trajectory of the system .",
    "the classical equations of motion are derived as the stationarity conditions for the action functional ( the hamilton principle , or the least action principle ) .    for fixed values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 and arbitrary trajectories",
    "@xmath87 , the action functional @xmath88 can be considered as a function taking the set of curves ( trajectories ) to the set of real numbers which can be treated as elements of @xmath68 . in this case",
    "the minimum of the action functional can be viewed as the maslov integral of this function over the set of trajectories or an idempotent analog of the euclidean version of the feynman path integral .",
    "the minimum of the action functional corresponds to the maximum of @xmath89 , i.e. idempotent integral @xmath90 with respect to the max - plus algebra @xmath91 .",
    "thus the least action principle can be considered as an idempotent version of the well - known feynman approach to quantum mechanics .",
    "the representation of a solution to the schrdinger equation in terms of the feynman integral corresponds to the lax ",
    "olenik solution formula for the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation .    since @xmath92 , @xmath93 , the following hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation holds : @xmath94    quantization leads to the schrdinger equation @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the wave function , i.e. , a time - dependent element of the hilbert space @xmath97 , and @xmath98 is the energy operator obtained by substitution of the momentum operators @xmath99 and the coordinate operators @xmath100 for the variables @xmath101 and @xmath102 in the hamiltonian function , respectively .",
    "this equation is linear in the conventional sense ( the quantum superposition principle ) .",
    "the standard procedure of limit transition from the schrdinger equation to the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation is to use the following ansatz for the wave function : @xmath103 , and to keep only the leading order as @xmath104 ( the ` semiclassical ' limit ) .    instead of doing this",
    ", we switch to imaginary values of the planck constant @xmath105 by the substitution @xmath106 , assuming @xmath107 .",
    "thus the schrdinger equation  ( 4 ) turns to an analog of the heat equation : @xmath108 where the real - valued function @xmath109 corresponds to the wave function @xmath110 .",
    "a similar idea ( the switch to imaginary time ) is used in the euclidean quantum field theory ; let us remember that time and energy are dual quantities .",
    "linearity of equation  ( 4 ) implies linearity of equation  ( 5 ) .",
    "thus if @xmath111 and @xmath112 are solutions of  ( 5 ) , then so is their linear combination @xmath113    let @xmath114 or @xmath115 as in section 2 above .",
    "it can easily be checked that equation  ( 5 ) thus turns to @xmath116 thus we have a transition from ( 4 ) to ( 7 ) by means of the change of variables @xmath117 .",
    "note that @xmath118 , where re@xmath31 is the real part of @xmath31 .",
    "now let us consider @xmath31 as a real variable .",
    "the equation ( 7 ) is nonlinear in the conventional sense .",
    "however , if @xmath119 and @xmath120 are its solutions , then so is the function @xmath121 obtained from  ( 6 ) by means of our substitution @xmath114 . here",
    "the generalized multiplication @xmath22 coincides with the ordinary addition and the generalized addition @xmath122 is the image of the conventional addition under the above change of variables .",
    "as @xmath123 , we obtain the operations of the idempotent semiring @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , and equation  ( 7 ) turns to the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation  ( 3 ) , since the third term in the right - hand side of equation  ( 7 ) vanishes .",
    "thus it is natural to consider the limit function @xmath126 as a solution of the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation and to expect that this equation can be treated as linear over @xmath60 .",
    "this argument ( clearly , a heuristic one ) can be extended to equations of a more general form . for a rigorous treatment of ( semiring ) linearity for these equations",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "notice that if @xmath28 is changed to @xmath127 , then we have that the resulting hamilton  jacobi equation is linear over @xmath68 .",
    "the idempotent superposition principle indicates that there exist important nonlinear ( in the traditional sense ) problems that are linear over idempotent semirings . the idempotent linear functional analysis ( see  @xcite ) is a natural tool for investigation of those nonlinear infinite - dimensional problems that possess this property . in practice",
    "infinite - dimensional problems can be approximated by finite - dimensional problems .",
    "so algorithms of idempotent linear algebras are especially important ( because of the superposition principle ! ) . below some examples",
    "are examined .",
    "there are very many important applications of tropical / idempotent mathematics ( and especially the correspondence and superposition principles ) including optimization and control , algebraic geometry , dynamic programming , differential equations , mathematical biology , mathematical physics and chemistry , transport and energoenergetic netwoks , interval analysis , mathematical economics , game theory , computer technology etc . , see , e.g.  @xcite .",

    "note that numerical algorithms for standard infinite - dimensional linear problems over idempotent semirings ( i.e. , for problems related to idempotent integration , integral operators and transformations , the hamilton - jacobi and generalized bellman equations ) deal with the corresponding finite - dimensional ( or finite ) `` linear approximations '' . nonlinear algorithms often can be approximated by linear ones .",
    "thus the idempotent linear algebra is a basis for the idempotent numerical analysis .",
    "moreover , it is well - known that linear algebra algorithms easily lend themselves to parallel computation ; their idempotent analogs admit parallelization as well .",
    "thus we obtain a systematic way of applying parallel computing to optimization problems . in this paper",
    "we do not deal with parallel algorithms and their implementations .",
    "computational algorithms are constructed on the basis of certain primitive operations .",
    "these operations manipulate data that describe `` numbers . ''",
    "these `` numbers '' are elements of a `` numerical domain , '' i.e. , a mathematical object such as the field of real numbers , the ring of integers , numerical and idempotent semirings and semifields .    in practice ,",
    "elements of the numerical domains are replaced by their computer representations , i.e. , by elements of certain finite models of these domains .",
    "examples of models that can be conveniently used for computer representation of real numbers are provided by various modifications of floating point arithmetics , approximate arithmetics of rational numbers  @xcite , and interval arithmetics .",
    "the difference between mathematical objects ( `` ideal '' numbers ) and their finite models ( computer representations ) results in computational ( e.g. , rounding ) errors .    an algorithm is called _ universal _ if it is independent of a particular numerical domain and/or its computer representation .",

    "it is clear that one algorithm can be more universal than another .",
    "for example , the simplest newton  cotes formula , the rectangular rule , provides the most universal algorithm for numerical integration .",
    "in particular , this formula is valid also for idempotent integration ( that is , over any idempotent semiring , see e.g. @xcite . other quadrature formulas ( e.g. , combined trapezoid rule or the simpson formula ) are independent of computer arithmetics and can be used ( e.g. , in the iterative form ) for computations with arbitrary accuracy . in contrast ,",
    "algorithms based on gauss ",
    "jacobi formulas are designed for fixed accuracy computations : they include constants ( coefficients and nodes of these formulas ) defined with fixed accuracy .",
    "( certainly , algorithms of this type can be made more universal by including procedures for computing the constants ; however , this results in an unjustified complication of the algorithms . )    modern achievements in software development and mathematics make us consider numerical algorithms and their classification from a new point of view .",
    "conventional numerical algorithms are oriented to software ( or hardware ) implementation based on floating point arithmetic and fixed accuracy .",
    "however , it is often desirable to perform computations with variable ( and arbitrary ) accuracy . for this purpose ,",
    "algorithms are required that are independent of the accuracy of computation and of the specific computer representation of numbers .",
    "in fact , many algorithms are independent not only of the computer representation of numbers , but also of concrete mathematical ( algebraic ) operations on data . in this case",
    ", operations themselves may be considered as variables .",
    "such algorithms are implemented in the form of _ generic programs _ based on abstract data types that are defined by the user in addition to the predefined types provided by the language .",
    "the corresponding program tools appeared as early as in simula-67 , but modern object - oriented languages ( like @xmath325 , see , e.g. , @xcite ) are more convenient for generic programming .",
    "computer algebra algorithms used in such systems as mathematica , maple , reduce , and others are also highly universal .    a different form of universality is featured by iterative algorithms ( beginning with the successive approximation method ) for solving differential equations ( e.g. , methods of euler , euler ",
    "cauchy , runge ",
    "kutta , adams , a number of important versions of the difference approximation method , and the like ) , methods for calculating elementary and some special functions based on the expansion in taylor s series and continuous fractions ( pad approximations ) .",
    "these algorithms are independent of the computer representation of numbers .",
    "the concept of a generic program was introduced by many authors ; for example , in  @xcite such programs were called ` program schemes . ' in this paper , we discuss universal algorithms implemented in the form of generic programs .",
    "a systematic application of the correspondence principle to computer calculations leads to a unifying approach to software and hardware design .",
    "the most important and standard numerical algorithms have many hardware realizations in the form of technical devices or special processors . _",
    "these devices often can be used as prototypes for new hardware units generated by substitution of the usual arithmetic operations for its semiring analogs and by addition tools for performing neutral elements @xmath129 and _ @xmath44 ( the latter usually is not difficult ) .",
    "of course , the case of numerical semirings consisting of real numbers ( maybe except neutral elements ) and semirings of numerical intervals is the most simple and natural .",
    "note that for semifields ( including @xmath60 and @xmath68 ) the operation of division is also defined .",
    "good and efficient technical ideas and decisions can be transposed from prototypes into new hardware units .",

    "recently , this type of programming technique has been dubbed the so - called generic programming ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . to help automate the generic programming , the so - called standard template library ( stl )",

    "the time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by this algorithm to run as a function of the size of the input to the problem .",
    "the time complexity of an algorithm is commonly expressed using big o notation , which suppresses multiplicative constants and lower order terms . when expressed this way ,",
    "the time complexity is said to be described asymptotically , i.e. , as the input size goes to infinity .",
    "the time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm . _ in idempotent mathematics ( and mathematics over positive semirings ) the elementary operations are basic operations described in subsection 7.4 above_.    for the space complexty , the situation is quite similar .",
    "the following definition is important for us .",
    "we shall say that two algorithms have the _ same complexity _ if they have the same asymptotic time and space complexity .    in principle idempotent mathematcs and",
    "its algorithms are more simple with respect to traditional mathematics .",
    "that is why the most important algorithms of idempotent mathematics ( and espcially idempotent linear algebra ) are polynomial .",

    "other problems of idempotent linear algebra were examined in  @xcite .",
    "idempotent mathematics appears to be remarkably simpler than its traditional analog .",
    "for example , in traditional interval arithmetic , multiplication of intervals is not distributive with respect to addition of intervals , whereas in idempotent interval arithmetic this distributivity is preserved .",
    "moreover , in traditional interval analysis the set of all square interval matrices of a given order does not form even a semigroup with respect to matrix multiplication : this operation is not associative since distributivity is lost in the traditional interval arithmetic . on the contrary , in the idempotent ( and positive ) case associativity",
    "is preserved . finally , in traditional interval analysis some problems of linear algebra , such as solution of a linear system of interval equations , can be very difficult ( more precisely , they are @xmath342-hard , see   @xcite and references therein ) . it was noticed in  @xcite that in the idempotent case solving an interval linear system requires a polynomial number of operations ( similarly to the usual gauss elimination algorithm ) .",
    "two properties that make the idempotent interval arithmetic so simple are monotonicity of arithmetic operations and positivity of all elements of an idempotent semiring .",

    "we can easily deduce the following result .",
    "the basic unary operation @xmath432 induces a nondecreasing mapping @xmath433 , and the basic binary operations @xmath434 , as well as supremum and infimum , induce nondecreasing mappings @xmath415 .",
    "if an elementary algorithm @xmath435 uses only these basic operations over a positive semiring , then it is positive . if @xmath431 is a completed semifield , then the unary inversion operation is @xmath430-regular but not positive .",
    "every composition of elementary ( and other @xmath430-regular algorithms ) is a @xmath430-regular algorithm .",
    "there exists an algorithm for computing @xmath243 which can be represented as a composition of positive operations with respect to @xmath431 , see subsection 7.2 above .",
    "hence this algorithm is positive .",
    "moreover each standard algorithm solving the stationary discrete bellman equation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) is positive and @xmath430-regular .",
    "some standard algorithms for solving the matrix equations @xmath436 , and other problems of tropical / idempotent linear algebra use the so - called ( binary ) pseudodivision operation , see , e.g. @xcite . in principle , this operation is not elementary or @xmath430-regular .",
    "however , using results presented in  @xcite , it is possible to reduce this operation to @xmath430-regular algorithms for all the basic numerical semirings .",
    "so the corresponding algorithms of linear algebra are @xmath430-regular .",
