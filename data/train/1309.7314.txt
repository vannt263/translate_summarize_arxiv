    "ever since its discovery , superconductivity has been of great importance for the understanding of quantum coherence .",
    "a particular example is the josephson effect which in the most simple terms can be understood as a reactive current which is driven by a gradient of the superconducting phase and thus establishes the macroscopic coherence of the latter @xcite .",
    "in fact , most of the physical phenomena related to superconducting tunnel junctions are governed by the josephson equations which have their microscopic origin in a coherent transfer of cooper pairs through the thin barrier .",
    "these equation predict that microwave radiation , also called _ josephson radiation _ , is produced by a voltage biased tunnel junction @xcite .",
    "the microwave radiation is emitted coherently at the josephson frequency @xmath0 which is given by twice the voltage bias @xmath1 that is applied across the junction @xcite ; here and below , @xmath2 denotes the elementary charge . with superconducting - semiconducting hybrid devices ,",
    "it is possible to imprint superconducting correlations onto semiconducting nano - devices like quantum dots or quantum wires @xcite .",
    "recently , the potential for the emergence of majorana fermions in such hybrid systems has attracted a lot of interest in condensed matter physics @xcite . with an appropriate tuning of the physical parameters , majorana",
    "zero modes are expected to appear as end states at the chemical potential of the superconductor @xcite . in particular , they are predicted to occur in one - dimensional semiconducting quantum wires in proximity to a conventional _ s_-wave superconductor subject to a moderate magnetic field @xcite . in fact , recent experimental works seem to be in agreement with these predictions @xcite . in contrast to conventional josephson junctions , single electrons can be transferred coherently in the presence of majorana zero modes @xcite leading to a @xmath3-periodic current - phase relationship @xcite .",
    "because of this , the josephson effect is dubbed _ fractional josephson effect _ @xcite and its observation would provide a clear evidence of majorana fermions .",
    "the a.c .",
    "fractional josephson effect was introduced in @xcite and describes the case of voltage biased josephson junctions with fractional supercurrents , see also @xcite for detailed discussion of the a.c .  effect . as a consequence ,",
    "non - trivial shapiro - steps with doubled height in the current - voltage relation emerge providing a signature of the majorana fermions @xcite . regarding the interaction of majorana zero modes with electromagnetic fields ,",
    "it has been recently shown that majorana fermions can be manipulated by means of microwave driving through weak coupling of microwave radiation to the states of a two majorana wires @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite the influence of majorana fermions on the photon coupling of a majorana - transmon qubit has been investigated .    .",
    "on top of each of them , there is a semiconducting nanowire ( gray cylinders ) in the topological phase supporting two majorana fermions ( red spheres ) at its ends .",
    "we consider the case where the josephson junction is voltage - biased such that cooper pairs which move across the junction emit radiation at the josephson frequency @xmath4 with @xmath1 the voltage applied .",
    "this process is indicated by the bold wavy line . due to the presence of the majorana fermions",
    ", there is the additional process allowed which proceeds via the tunneling of a single unpaired electrons together with the emission of radiation at at half the josephson - frequency indicated by the thin wavy line . in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on the latter process.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in this work , we want to focus on the radiation that arises from coupling majorana fermions to the electromagnetic field in a voltage - biased situation . in analogy to the common a.c .",
    "josephson effect we show that the majorana - induced josephson radiation is coherent radiation with a frequency that is half of the josephson frequency .",
    "furthermore , there is a mutual relationship between the emitted radiation and the state of the majorana fermions . as a consequence ,",
    "the system exhibits correlations between the radiation fields emitted from different sources that are situated far away from each other .",
    "we will first introduce the coupling of the majorana zero modes with the electromagnetic field .",
    "then , we proceed outlining different possible realizations of a voltage biased fractional josephson junction .",
    "subsequently , we derive the semiclassical equation governing the radiation field when the junction is placed in a cavity .",
    "moreover , we will discuss the steady state solution and possible decoherence mechanisms .",
    "we will finish with the discussion of correlations of spatially separated radiation sources and show that the superconducting coherence is partially imprinted onto the radiation field . in this respect ,",
    "the system is closely related to prior work @xcite which we will discuss in details below .",
    "in topological superconductors , majorana fermions denoted by @xmath5 appear as quasi - particles in the middle of the gap .",
    "due to the build - in particle - hole symmetry of superconductors in the mean field description these solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes equation are made - up from equal superpositions of electrons and holes , @xmath6 \\ , d^3 r,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 denotes the fermionic field operator of the electrons and @xmath8 is the wave function of a zero energy solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes equation which is localized at either end of the nanowire @xcite .",
    "the majorana operators obey the clifford algebra @xmath9 . in case",
    "the wire is manufactured on top of a josephson junction additional majorana fermions have to be taken into account on either side of the josephson junction @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we consider four majorana bound states in the system denoted by @xmath10 , cf.figure  [ fig : maj - jos - junct ] . for the further analysis , it is convenient to introduce two conventional fermionic operators @xmath11 these fermionic operators account for the parity of the number of electrons on either side of the josephson junction with the parity given by @xmath12 , @xmath13 . the fermionic hilbert - space is four dimensional and spanned by the vectors @xmath14 .",
    "it can be generated from the `` vacuum '' state @xmath15 via @xmath16 where we have assembled the states according to the total parity @xmath17 being even or odd and introduced the shorthand notation @xmath18 .",
    "it is important to notice that the total parity is conserved such that we only have to consider two out of the four states at one point .",
    "note that for an open system the parity constraint may be violated , e.g. , when taking quasi - particle poisoning into account .    due to the fact that the majorana fermions are present , an exchange of single electrons between the two sides of the josephson junction becomes possible which manifests itself in the current - phase relationship having a fundamental period of @xmath3 . here , we are interested in the josephson radiation emitted by such a device .",
    "for a conventional josephson junction , the microscopic origin of the a.c .",
    "josephson effect are cooper pairs tunneling across the junction thereby transferring a charge @xmath19 and emitting one photon at the josephson frequency . in the case of the fractional josephson effect ,",
    "also single electron tunneling is allowed which will lead to the emission of radiation at half the josephson frequency .",
    "the coupling of the majorana fermions to the electromagnetic field is provided by a non - vanishing dipole matrix element entering the dipole hamiltonian @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the dipole operator with @xmath22 being the position operator and @xmath23 is the charge of the electron .",
    "as explained in details in [ ap::bdg - dipole ] , the dipole operator of the majorana zero modes for the junction in figure  [ fig : maj - jos - junct ] is given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 the phase difference across the junction and @xmath26 the typical distance between the two majorana fermions 2 and 3 . in deriving ( [ eq :",
    "dipole ] ) , we have taken into account that only @xmath27 and @xmath28 have a considerable overlap such that the dipole operator only involves the majorana fermions at the junction .",
    "note that even though the majorana fermions are charge neutral , the system exhibits a finite dipole matrix element .",
    "the reason is that even though the majorana fermions carry only information about the probability amplitude of chargeless quasiparticles , the charge is provided by the superconducting condensate via the cosine term involving the superconducting phase difference @xcite .",
    "if we imagine that the junction is placed in a cavity supporting a single mode at frequency @xmath29 , the electrical field operator @xmath30 can be written as @xmath31 with @xmath32 the polarization vector and @xmath1 the volume of the cavity mode . in conclusion",
    ", we have the hamiltonian @xmath33 describing the interaction of the majorana zero modes with the electromagnetic radiation with @xmath34 the light - matter interaction strength .",
    "as the dipole operator is oriented along the nanowire , we need to consider a mode with the electric field having a component along the wire as otherwise the coupling @xmath35 vanishes .",
    "most importantly , the interaction hamiltonian depends on half of the superconducting phase difference @xmath36 indicating that with each tunneling event a single electrical charge is transferred across the junction .",
    "since the amount of a single electron charge @xmath23 ( half of a cooper pair ) is transferred from one condensate to the other the dipole matrix element is @xmath3 periodic with respect to the superconducting phase difference . comparing ( [ eq : majorana - dipole - interaction ] ) with the pure tunneling contribution of the fractional josephson effect @xcite ( with tunneling strength @xmath37 )",
    "@xmath38 shows that there is a close relationship between dipole and tunneling interaction . in both @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "the majorana wave functions need to have a considerable overlap such that single fermion transfer is enabled .",
    "indeed both contributions ( [ eq : majorana - dipole - interaction ] ) and ( [ eq : fractional - josephson - effect ] ) are complementary in the sense that ( [ eq : fractional - josephson - effect ] ) is present at zero bias voltage and ( [ eq : majorana - dipole - interaction ] ) only becomes important for non - zero bias as the dipole coupling allows for transitions at any energy difference via emission / absorption of a photon carrying the energy surplus .",
    "accordingly , the photon produced by a single electron transfer carries the energy @xmath41 which corresponds to half of the josephson frequency @xmath42 .",
    "therefore it makes sense to call the dipole coupling hamiltonian @xmath39 the a.c .",
    "analog of the d.c .  josephson effect .    .",
    "the gate controls the hybridization strength of the majorana fermions at the josephson junction .",
    "the bias voltage @xmath1 shifts the fermi energies with respect to each other and leads to an a.c .",
    "josephson effect .",
    "the panel ( b ) shows a similar design with less tunability since the gated part of the nanowire is replaced with a narrow layer of insulator interrupting the semiconducting nanowire . in both of these setups ,",
    "the radiation frequency is bounded by the superconducting gap and thus typically is in the microwave regime .",
    "this limitation can be overcome in the design ( c ) which shows the band diagram of a _",
    "p - n _ junction .",
    "the different dopings lead to a pinning of the fermi - energy in the valence band ( left ) and the conduction band ( right ) . around the fermi",
    "- energies a small superconducting gap is opened due to the proximity to the superconductors which leads additionally to two majorana bound states ( red spheres ) , on in the valence band and one in the conduction band .",
    "the junction is operated in the forward bias regime with a potential difference comparable to the band - gap @xmath43.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]      as the main ingredient for the present proposal , a josephson junction where the wave function of the majorana fermions on either side have sufficient overlap is needed .",
    "this junction then needs to be embedded in a cavity to store and amplify the radiation field .",
    "superconducting hybrid devices are very flexible and offer many possibilities to obtain a desired physical effect . employing this freedom , we present three different designs for realizing fractional josephson radiation .",
    "a possible setup involves a semiconducting nanowire covered by two conventional _ s_-wave superconductors with a gateable junction in between , see figure  [ fig : junctions ]  ( a ) .",
    "given the fact that the device is in its topological phase , there are four majorana fermions formed .",
    "an external bias voltage @xmath1 shifts the fermi levels of wires with respect to each other and the gate is used to control the josephson coupling strength , i.e. , the size of the majorana wave function overlap which enters the dipole moment . it is important to note that the bias voltage is bound by the superconducting gap , @xmath44 , as otherwise undesired quasiparticles will be generated . given the typical size of a superconducting gap of the order of a few kelvin , the resulting josephson radiation will be in the microwave regime .",
    "obviously , the gated part of the nanowire can be replaced by a narrow , insulating barrier included in the nanowire in the growth process , cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : junctions ]  ( b ) . compared to the case ( a )",
    "discussed above , one would expect a larger overlap of the wave - function in this case leading to a stronger light - matter interaction @xmath35 with the drawback that the parameter is not tunable any more .",
    "inspired by @xcite , there is another variant that makes use of a superconducting _ p - n _ diode , embedding a _",
    "p - n _ diode in a semiconducting nanowire , see figure  [ fig : junctions ]  ( c ) . doping _",
    "p_- and _ n_-type carriers at the left and right side makes a _",
    "p - n _ diode out of the wire and majorana fermions are formed from the valence and conduction band , respectively .",
    "recent investigations showed that the topological phase of a semiconducting nanowire persists even in presence of material imperfections ( large dopant concentrations ) @xcite .",
    "the effect of dopants in the nanowire shifts the chemical potential towards the conduction or valence bands depending on carrier type and concentration .",
    "typically for semiconducting nanowires there are two conduction bands and four hole bands , whereas the light - hole bands are split - off because of the boundary conditions in quasi one - dimensional wires .",
    "light- and heavy - hole bands carry total angular momentum @xmath45 with heavy holes being characterized by @xmath46 . out of the heavy hole states ,",
    "majorana fermions are formed for the hole band exactly as for the conventional electron band . across the _ p - n _ junction",
    "the bands will bend such that the electro - chemical potential remains constant . by applying reversed bias voltage ,",
    "i.e. , connect the _",
    "p_-type side with the negative pole and the _ n_-type side with the positive pole of a voltage source the junction acts as an insulator up to voltages of the order of the band gap @xmath47 .",
    "the corresponding energy diagram is shown in figure  [ fig : junctions ]  ( c ) .",
    "this setup allows to increase the josephson frequency from the superconducting gap to the band - gap @xmath43 of the semiconductor .",
    "for typical semiconductors with rather strong spin - orbit interaction , as for instance inas , the band gap is of the order of @xmath48{ev}$ ] corresponding to wavelengths of around @xmath49{\\mu m}$ ] .",
    "hence , the radiation will be emitted in the mid - infrared regime .",
    "similar devices have been proposed in other system involving quantum dots and a _",
    "p - n _ junction which allows to shift the josephson frequency into the optical frequency range @xcite .",
    "the proposal of @xcite discusses incoherent radiation in the emission band close to half the josephson frequency and additionally coherent emission at the josephson frequency arising from the coherent transfer of cooper pairs . on the other hand",
    ", the proposal of @xcite leads to coherent radiation at half the josephson frequency due to the fact that the device is embedded in a microcavity ; thus , the device has been named `` half - josephson laser '' . although the optical phase of the laser is locked to the superconducting phase difference , decoherence of a half - josephson laser is induced by spontaneous switches between different states of the quantum dot .",
    "further elaborations have demonstrated that coherence times of emitted light from an array consisting of many emitters placed in a single cavity are exponentially long @xcite .",
    "the main difference of these proposals to the present work is the fact that in our case there is no need for quantum dots as the majorana bound states are formed at the interface without additional confinement .",
    "furthermore , the bound states are automatically aligned with the chemical potential of the superconductor and thus there is no need for ( fine-)tuning of the dot parameters .",
    "even though we have advertised three different physical implementation schemes of josephson radiation from majorana fermions all of them can be described by a single effective model . this is because in all three setups the physical process leading to radiation is tunneling of single electrons accompanied by the emission of a photon as described by ( [ eq : majorana - dipole - interaction ] ) .",
    "taking additionally the energy of the photons in the cavity as well as possible overlap terms between majorana fermions on each wire section into account , we arrive at the model hamiltonian @xmath50 \\gamma_2 \\gamma_3 ( a +        a^\\dagger )        \\label{eq : model - hamiltonian}\\ ] ] which is the basis for the subsequent analysis ; here , the overlap amplitudes are denoted by @xmath51 and @xmath52 for majorana modes @xmath53 in the left and @xmath54 in the right section of the nanowire , respectively .",
    "these coefficients are decaying exponentially with the separation @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the length of a particular wire section and @xmath57 is the superconducting coherence length @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been assumed that majorana modes @xmath58 and @xmath59 are located too far away from each other such that their overlap can be neglected compared to @xmath60 .",
    "the applied bias voltage is taken into account by a time - dependent superconducting phase @xmath61 . in deriving ( [ eq : model - hamiltonian ] ) , we have neglected all quasiparticle excitation above the superconducting gap which leads to the requirement that @xmath62 . moreover , we have used the fact that we are interested in a situation where the photon frequency is @xmath63 . because of this , we neglected both the contribution from the d.c .",
    "fractional josephson effect ( [ eq : fractional - josephson - effect ] ) as well as from usual cooper pair tunneling as those contributions are off resonance .",
    "the model hamiltonian ( [ eq : model - hamiltonian ] ) describes the dynamics of the majorana bound states in a josephson junction as well as dynamics of the radiation field .",
    "note that the superconducting condensate acts as a driving force in this model .",
    "it is convenient to represent ( [ eq : model - hamiltonian ] ) in terms of a fockspace basis consisting of states @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the state of the photon mode occupied with @xmath66 photons and @xmath67 describing the fermionic states as introduced in ( [ eq : majorana - states ] ) .",
    "next , we assume that the voltage @xmath68 is large compared to the other characteristic energies of the system @xmath69 .",
    "we change via the unitary transformation @xmath70 from ( [ eq : model - hamiltonian ] ) into a rotating frame where we neglect the rapidly oscillating terms @xmath71 .",
    "we then end up with the hamiltonian @xmath72 in the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) ; here , we have introduced the new operators @xmath73 absorbing the superconducting phase at the initial time @xmath74 .      as we are interested in the resonant regime of small @xmath75 , many photons will accumulate in the cavity due to the driving of the superconducting phase .",
    "if the cavity losses are small compared to the pumping rate , many photons will accumulate in the cavity and the radiation field will approach a classical state with a photon number @xmath76 .",
    "we want to refer to this limit as the semiclassical limit , because the degrees of freedom of the nanowire are still treated quantum mechanically .",
    "the semiclassical approximation in ( [ eq : rwa - hamiltonian ] ) amounts to replacing @xmath77 with the complex number @xmath78 .",

    "the equations of motion for @xmath81 can be derived from the heisenberg equation of motion for @xmath77 .",

    "the stationary solutions are given by ( [ eq : stationary - points ] ) with the additional constraint @xmath163 which correlates both field amplitudes @xmath128 and @xmath129 by the parity constraint .",
    "hence the d.c .- squid geometry exhibits a strong correlation between different stationary fields for arbitrary spatial - separation .",

    "we have shown that partially coherent josephson radiation is emitted at half of the josephson frequency .",

    "we have analyzed the correlation between two emitters which are spatially - separated but share the same superconductors .",
    "we have discussed the effect of the fermionic parity constraint in a d.c .- squid geometry as well as the pinning of the josephson frequency in terms of a second order correlator and suggested a possible way to experimentally obtain this information .",
