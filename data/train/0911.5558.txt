    "studies of microstructural evolution in phase - separating alloys attract interest from both fundamental and applied points of view . > from the fundamental side , elucidation of microscopic mechanisms for the formation and evolution of embryos of new phases arising under the first - order phase transitions is one of the principal problems in statistical physics being not well understood as yet . from the applied side , understanding factors that determine different characteristics of microstructure formed under precipitation is important to control these characteristics , particularly for alloys with nano - sized precipitates which attract recently much attention in connection with industrial applications @xcite .    presently , theoretical studies of the precipitation kinetics employ usually either the phase - field method ( pfm ) @xcite or monte carlo modeling @xcite",
    ". however , employing the phase - field methods to describe nucleation and evolution of nano - sized precipitates can be misleading for at least three reasons .",
    "first , the `` continuous '' approximation used in the pfm disregards the discrete lattice effects which should be important at first stages of nucleation when typical precipitate sizes are few lattice constants .",
    "second , at the concentration and temperature values typical for applications , the mean - field - type calphad expressions for thermodynamic potentials usually employed in the pfm studies @xcite will be shown to strongly distort the position of spinodals , thus using these expressions can drastically distort the type of microstructural evolution .",
    "third , treatment of fluctuative terms ( being crucial for the nucleation stage ) in the `` stochastic pfm '' versions used in applications until now @xcite seems to be arbitrary and inconsistent @xcite , while the adequate description of these terms determines all main characteristics of microstructure .",
    "therefore , the only reliable source of theoretical information about nucleation and evolution of nano - sized precipitates now is monte carlo modeling , in particular , the kinetic monte carlo approach ( kmca ) developed in refs .",
    ". however , present versions of the kmca are time - consuming , which may partly explain a relatively few number of applications of this method to concrete systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , the lattice misfit and elastic strain effects important for many phase - separating alloys can not be easily taken into account in the kmca , while it makes no problem for statistical approaches @xcite .",
    "finally , in the kmca it is often difficult to follow the dependence of various characteristics of evolution on thermodynamic and microscopic parameters of an alloy , such as the composition , temperature , different interaction constants , etc , while it is usually much simpler for statistical methods based on some analytical equations .",
    "therefore , the development of a consistent statistical theory which takes into account all achievements of the kmca seems to be very important for a more deep understanding of the phase separation kinetics .",
    "recently sroev et al .",
    "@xcite ( spv ) presented an attempt to develop such a theory using the stochastic statistical approach ( ssa ) described below in sec .",
    "iii b. to illustrate the main ideas of this approach , spv used only simplest methods and models , such as the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) , continuous approximations , the direct - atomic - exchange rather than the vacancy exchange kinetic model , oversimplified interaction models , etc , while no attempts of quantitative treatments for realistic alloy models have been made .",
    "the main aim of the present work is to raise the accuracy and the predictive power of the ssa in describing the precipitation kinetics for realistic alloy models up to the level comparable to that of the kmca . to this end",
    ", we perform detailed studies of nucleation and evolution of nano - sized precipitates in fe - cu alloys using both the kmca @xcite and the ssa .",
    "this requires many refinements of simple models used by spv .",
    "we have to consider the realistic vacancy - mediated exchange kinetics rather than the simplified direct - atomic - exchange model ; to use the quantitative , cluster statistical methods rather than the simple mfa ; to allow for strong concentration and temperature dependences of generalized mobilities in the resulting kinetic equations , etc .",
    "all these refinements are made in the present work .",
    "we also introduce the `` maximum thermodynamic gain '' principle to determine the key kinetic parameter of the ssa , the characteristic length of local equilibrium in the course of the nucleation process .    in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the methodological problems mentioned above : generalizations of our statistical approach to the vacancy - mediated kinetics case ; employing cluster methods for both thermodynamic and kinetic statistical calculations ; elaboration of effective methods for calculations of effective mobilities which enter resulting kinetic equations , etc .",
    "here we also generalize the earlier - suggested `` equivalence theorem '' @xcite which enables us to reduce the vacancy - mediated kinetics to that for some equivalent direct - exchange models . in sec .",
    "iii we remind basic ideas of the classical theory of nucleation and present the main equations of the ssa . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the models and the methods of simulations used and we describe the `` maximum thermodynamic gain '' principle suggested to estimate the local equilibrium length mentioned above . in sec .",
    "v we discuss the features of microstructural evolution observed in the kmca and ssa simulations for various alloy states considered .",
    "here we also use the ssa to study kinetics of nucleation and influence of variations of temperature or concentration on evolution of microstructure .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "in this section we derive kinetic equations for mean occupations of lattice sites disregarding fluctuations of atomic fluxes which lead to local violations of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "these `` quasi - equilibrium kinetic equations '' ( qke ) differ from the stochastic kinetic equations discussed below ( which take into account such fluctuations ) and generalize those used by spv @xcite for simplified direct - atomic - exchange models to more realistic , vacancy - mediated - exchange ( vme ) models . here",
    "we also generalize a similar treatment of the vme kinetics made by belashchenko and vaks @xcite ( bv ) to more realistic vme models used in refs . @xcite and below .",
    "we consider a substitutional alloy with @xmath0 components @xmath1 which includes atoms of @xmath2 different species @xmath3 and vacancies v : @xmath4 .",

    "for example , bv used the `` vacancy conservation '' model , while in simulations @xcite and below , a possible creation of vacancies at various lattice defects ( grain boundaries , dislocations , etc ) is taken into account . thus , the form of the function @xmath160 depends also on the kinetic model used for vacancies .",
    "the results presented in fig .",
    "[ t_r - t ] below show that temporal variations of @xmath160 can be rather sharp .",
    "these variations arise due to qualitative changes in the distribution of vacancies with respect to minority atoms related to the phenomenon of `` vacancy trapping '' at interfaces of precipitates discussed in detail by bv and by soisson and fu @xcite ( sf ) .",
    "the resulting excess of vacancies near growing or shrinking interfaces leads to an acceleration of effective exchange rates @xmath201 with respect to the incubation stage when the precipitates are absent .",
    "it results in an increase of @xmath202 after beginning of nucleation , and when the vacancy trapping effect is strong , this increase can be very large , which is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ t_r - t ] below . at the same time , after the nucleation stage is over , the degree of this trapping does not change significantly .",

    "before to describe the ssa , it is convenient to remind the main ideas of the classical theory of nucleation ( ctn ) .",

    "the excess free energy needed to form this embryo is : @xmath205 one of basic notions of the ctn is the critical embryo that can grow with no further loss of the free energy and thus with no fluctuations . for the model ( [ f_r ] )",

    "dobretsov and vaks @xcite developed a quantitative approach to calculate thermodynamics of critical embryos which takes into account the discrete lattice effects and uses the pca rather than the simple mfa .",
    "some results of this approach are used below in table ii and fig .",
    "[ crit - embryos ] .    for supercritical embryos with @xmath212 , the ctn suggests fluctuation effects to be insignificant .",
    "therefore , after completion of nucleation , the main type of microstructural evolution is growth of embryos due to the diffusional flux of minority atoms from the matrix .",
    "later on , the evaporation - condensation ( or lifshits - slyozov - wagner - lsw ) mechanism becomes dominant when the larger precipitates grow at the expense of smaller ones @xcite .",
    "therefore , according to the ctn , decomposition of metastable solid solutions should include four well - defined stages @xcite : ( i ) the incubation stage that precedes formation of first critical and supercritical embryos ; ( ii ) the nucleation stage during which the supercritical precipitate density @xmath213 reaches its maximum value ; ( iii ) the growth stage when the density @xmath214 remains approximately constant but sizes of precipitates grow , and ( iv ) the coarsening stage when the density @xmath214 decreases due to the lsw evaporation - condensation mechanism .",
    "these ctn ideas were confirmed by kmc simulations of soisson and martin @xcite ( sm ) for some simple alloy model for which critical sizes and nucleation barriers ( estimated in table ii below ) are rather large , see , , fig . 1 of sm .",
