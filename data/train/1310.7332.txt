    "the theory of large deviations gives an asymptotic computation of small probabilities on exponential scale .",
    "estimates based on large deviations play a crucial role in resolving a variety of problems in several fields . a part of these problems has interest in risk theory and are solved by considering large deviation estimates for some level crossing probabilities as , for instance , the ruin probabilities for some insurance models or the overflow probabilities for some queueing models .    in this paper",
    "we consider the damped telegraph process in di crescenzo and martinucci ( 2010 ) which is derived from the standard telegraph process in beghin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; actually we have in mind the case with drift ( see orsingher ( 1990 ) for the case without drift ) .",
    "more precisely we consider the process @xmath0 which is a slight generalization of the one in di crescenzo and martinucci ( 2010 ) because an arbitrary distribution for the random initial velocity is allowed ( see eq . below ) .",
    "a recent paper on large deviations for some telegraph processes is de gregorio and macci ( 2012 ) .",
    "there is a wide literature on several versions of the telegraph process , with applications ; here we recall mazza and rullire ( 2004 ) which illustrated an interesting link between the standard telegraph process and the standard risk process in insurance ( we mean the _ compound poisson model _ in section 5.3 in rolski et al . ( 1999 ) , or the _ cramr - lundberg model _ in section 1.1 in embrechts et al . ( 1997 ) ) with exponentially distributed claim sizes .",
    "the results in this paper have interest for the asymptotic behavior of some item modeled on a semi - markov process ( a wide source of models can be found in janssen and manca ( 2006 , 2007 ) ) ; actually the random evolution of @xmath0 is driven by a continuous time markov chain with two states and linearly increasing switching rates , and therefore it is driven by a particular non - homogeneous semi - markov process .",
    "a result in this paper concerns the probability that the process @xmath0 crosses the level @xmath1 on the infinite time horizon @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath3 then , under a stability condition ( see eq .",

    "the limit has a strict relationship with some sharp exponential upper bounds for level crossing probabilities , as for instance the well - known _ lundberg inequality _ for random walks or lvy processes ( see e.g. theorem 5.1 in asmussen ( 2003 ) ) .",
    "we also recall that in some cases the lundberg inequality can be seen as entropy estimate with an interesting structure familiar from thermodynamics ( see the discussion in martin - lf ( 1986 ) ) .",
