    "fano resonance @xcite , a phenomenon that causes asymmetric conductance peaks due to interference between resonant and nonresonant states , is observed in several mesoscopic systems @xcite .",
    "recently , first observations of fano resonances are reported in crossed carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "al . _ claimed that fano resonances can not be observed in single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) and only appear when two nanotubes cross each other because the fano resonances are attributed to the resonant scattering by the crossed region .",
    "fano resonances are observed in multi - walled carbon nanotubes ( mwnts ) as well , and are considered to be due to impurities , defects or disorders @xcite .",
    "also theoretical prediction of fano resonances for a multiply - connected carbon nanotube has been reported where asymmetric resonance peaks are originated from the scattering by the localized states on the heptagonal defects @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "babi _ et .",
    "_ reported that , even in swnts without crossed contacts , fano resonances can be observed due to the interference between narrow and wide orbitals @xcite .    in this report",
    ", we investigate the possibility of fano resonances in a single armchair nanotube with the aid of the c@xmath0-algebraic method as in our previous work on the ab - ring @xcite .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian is adopted for describing the electronic states of swnts and only the linear response regime is considered .",
    "we show that , when the swnt - electrode coupling is axially asymmetric , fano - like resonances exist for an armchair swnt .",
    "we consider a system consisting of the two - dimensional electrodes and a finite - size armchair swnt without caps ( see fig.[latticenanotube](a ) ) . in this section , the electronic structure of the finite - size swnt",
    "is reviewed @xcite .",
    "the nanotube can be regarded as a rolled graphene sheet and it is convenient to adopt the primitive lattice vectors of the graphene sheet for specifying the atomic positions : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the integers , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the nearest - neighbor bond length .",
    "the armchair nanotube is constructed by rolling the graphene sheet along the @xmath9-direction in fig.[latticenanotube](b ) .",
    "the nearest - neighbor tight - binding hamiltonian is used to describe the nanotube : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the annihilation operator of the @xmath12 electron with spin @xmath13 at site @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the nearest - neighbor hopping strength and the on - site energy @xmath16 linearly depends on the gate voltage applied to the nanotube . throughout this report",
    ", the repeated spin index means the summation over it .",
    "the coulomb interaction is neglected . in the case of the armchair nanotube ,",
    "the site @xmath14 is identified with @xmath17 and , then , the condition : @xmath18 is imposed . in terms of new annihilation operators : + @xmath19 + where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the hamiltonian of an armchair swnt of length @xmath23 becomes : @xmath24 .",
    "\\notag \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we remark that @xmath25 satisfies : @xmath26 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath27 is , then , diagonalized by a unitary transformation : @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "and one has @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "note that , as @xmath32 for @xmath33 , the armchair swnt is metallic .    .",
    "( b ) unit cell ( dotted line ) for an armchair nanotube in 2d graphite sheet . ]",
    "now we consider the effect of the electrodes .",
    "the total hamiltonian is given by : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the energy of the left or right electrode and @xmath36 is the single - electron energy : @xmath37 with @xmath38 the source - drain voltage .",
    "the second term @xmath27 stands for the nanotube hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and @xmath39 represents the tunneling between the nanotube and electrodes .",
    "we denote @xmath40 and @xmath41 are given by : @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , + @xmath47 is the phase of @xmath48 and the product @xmath49 stands for the tunneling strength between each edge site of the nanotube and the electrode @xmath50 .    in order to calculate the steady - state current from the left to right electrodes",
    ", we derive the asymptotic in - coming fields @xmath51 that are solutions of the heisenberg equation : @xmath52=-\\omega _ { k\\lambda}\\beta _ { k\\sigma \\lambda}$ ] .",
    "they are given by : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , + @xmath55 , + @xmath56 , + @xmath57 , + @xmath58 , @xmath59 . in the above , @xmath60 .",
    "as in @xcite , if the system admits no bound state , a nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) is rigorously constructed from the time - evolution . the ness is found to satisfy wick s theorem and is fully specified by the two - point function : @xmath61 where @xmath62 indicates the fermi - dirac distribution function of the electrode @xmath50 with temperature @xmath63 and chemical potential @xmath64 .",
    "+ the current operator is the time - derivative of the left - electrode number operator : @xmath65 and its average is @xmath66 by expressing @xmath67 with the asymptotic field operators @xmath51 and by using ( [ eq : soukan ] ) , the steady - state current casts into the landauer formula @xcite : @xmath68 where @xmath69max@xmath70 .",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath71 is @xmath72 ) . here",
    ", we are interested in the linear response regime at @xmath73 and the variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 are taken to be the same and @xmath76-independent , i.e. , @xmath77 .",
    "as the nanotube length is finite , the integrand of ( [ eq : denryu ] ) is a highly - oscillatory function of @xmath78 with period @xmath79 .",
    "so we consider the average conductance : @xmath80 where @xmath38 is the source - drain voltage . in fig .",
    "[ carbonkinji1 - 1 ] , the average conductance for @xmath81 is shown as a function of @xmath16 which corresponds to the gate voltage .",
    "the structural parameters of the nanotube are @xmath82 , which corresponds to the length of @xmath83 @xmath84 m and the diameter of @xmath85 nm .    one can see that the envelope forms an asymmetric resonance peak around at @xmath86 .",
    "the case of @xmath87 corresponds to the half - filled swnt band and the flat region observed from @xmath88 to @xmath89 comes from the conduction band .",
    "the sharp peak below @xmath89 seems to arise from the van hove singularity of the valence band nearest to the conduction band .",
    "we remark that the conductance is suppressed just below the conductance maximum ( ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the dip seems to be caused by the interference between the two bands , the conduction and valence bands .",
    "this means that the valence band nearest to the conduction band contributes to the interference . in the system of the wave - guide geometry , even without the confined states , similar suppression of the transmission due to the interference",
    "has been reported @xcite .",
    "we note that such asymmetric peaks are very sensitive to the coupling between the nanotube and electrodes . in the above calculation ,",
    "four tunneling matrix elements @xmath91 involved in @xmath92 are taken as the same real numbers .",
    "this assumption implies that the nanotube contacts with both electrodes _ via _ single sites .",
    "this choice breaks the axial symmetry of the coupling , but the left and right contacts are equivalent . indeed , when nanotube - electrode coupling is axially symmetric , fano - like shapes disappear in the conductance .",
    "this could be understood as follows : suppose that an asymmetric peak arises from the interference between axially symmetric and asymmetric states .",
    "then , if the coupling is axially symmetric , non - symmetric nanotube states do not contribute to the transport and the asymmetric peak would disappear . +     and ( n , m)=(7000,15 ) . ]",
    "we found that conductance shows fano - like line shapes even in a single swnt due to the interference between conduction and valence bands .",
    "these peaks are strongly affected by the contact condition .",
    "our analysis implies that , even for the same swnts , fano resonances may or may not appear depending on the contact condition with electrodes .",
    "therefore , we think that the observations by kim _ et . al .",
    "_ @xcite and by the babi @xcite are consistent .",
    "the exact form of the peaks depends on the nanotube structure and the contact conditions .",
    "therefore , in order to reproduce experimentally observed conductance , more detail information on the experimental setting is required .",
    "moreover , the neglected effects of the electron - electron interaction should be taken into account . in the present work ,",
    "we have shown the possibility of fano like conductance peak and its dependence on the contact condition .",
    "we believe the essence of these features is not altered .",
