    "the nature of the light scalar mesons remains a key challenge for our understanding of how qcd generates bound states . exceptionally strong and diverse mixing patterns between the differently flavored quarkonium components and with scalar glueballs are among the intricacies which kept this sector exciting and controversial for more than four decades .",
    "theoretical approaches to the subject include a long tradition of model building , methods based on dispersion relations and effective field theories , qcd sum - rule analyses and more recently devoted and unquenched lattice simulations .",
    "the corresponding literature may be  traced at least partly from the reviews @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", evidence has accumulated in favor of jaffe s classic suggestion @xcite that the lightest scalar meson nonet with masses below 1 gev ( and potentially a first recurrence beyond 1 gev @xcite ) may contain a dominant ( cryptoexotic ) tetraquark component mai04,bri05,jaf05,tho08,ams08,latt .",
    "this at present arguably most convincing interpretation demands an explanation for the exceptionally strong binding between the four valencequarks , however , which is able to reduce the lightest tetraquark mass significantly below that of the scalar quark - antiquark ground state . with the advent of holographic strong - coupling techniques based on the gauge / gravity correspondence @xcite and the construction of a first generation of approximate holographic qcd ( or ads / qcd ) duals",
    "@xcite it seems pertinent to explore whether those can provide new insights into existence and structure of strongly bound tetraquarks . in the present note",

    "those were based exclusively on quark ",
    "antiquark interpolators , however , which presuppose a @xmath0-dominated meson structure .",
    "moreover , the first two of them exclude the lightest scalars ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) from their analysis . in any case",
    ", it is rather obvious ( and will be discussed in more detail below ) that a straightforward extension of this approach to @xmath3 interpolators  would describe four - quark states which are heavier , not lighter than the @xmath0 ground state .",
    "our main focus will therefore be to search for a minimal but systematic ads / qcd extension in which tetraquarks emerge naturally as the lightest scalar mesons .",
    "the sought - after holographic mechanism should further be able to render higher tetraquark excitations heavy ( and thus broad ) enough to avoid generating more low - lying scalar nonets than experimentally seen .",
    "in looking for a holographic representation of the required binding , we are guided by the expectation that the lightest scalar tetraquarks essentially consist of a good  ( i.e. maximally attractive ) diquark and a good antidiquark which form an @xmath4-wave bound state @xcite . the exceptional lightness of the tetraquark ground state is then mainly a consequence of the good diquark s large ( and potentially instanton - induced sch94,sch03,cri04 ) binding energy @xcite .",
    "this suggests to adapt the approach introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which describes systematic mass reductions among the light baryons due to good - diquark binding holographically in terms of bulk - mass corrections for their dual modes , to the problem .",
    "below we will explore to what extent such corrections , as induced by the anomalous dimension of the corresponding four - quark interpolator , are able to generate light scalar tetraquarks as well .",

    "the mass spectrum of the scalar meson nonets is then determined by the @xmath23-dependent , bilinear part @xmath24 = \\frac{1}{2\\kappa ^{2}}\\int d^{5}x\\sqrt{\\left\\vert g\\right\\vert } e^{-\\phi } \\left [ g^{mn}\\partial _ { m}\\varphi \\partial _",

    "should therefore be regarded as a working hypothesis . in any case",
    ", it provides a consistent @xmath36 counting for the so far calculated observables and a semi - quantitative description of classical hadron properties ( at the 1030% level ) .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that this naive treatment faces more challenging tasks in the exotic multiquark  sector where the @xmath36 dependence can be particularly strong and where the extrapolation to @xmath40 becomes a practical necessity .",
    "indeed , exotics are dissolving in the @xmath41 limit @xcite ( tetraquarks perhaps already for @xmath42 as unitarized chiral perturbation theory suggests @xcite ) and the higher - lying tetraquarks are expected to remain highly unstable under strong decay ( with widths comparable to their masses ) even at @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "our main focus will be on the lightest scalar tetraquark nonet , however , which should be relatively narrow ( due to the paucity of open decay channels , limited phase space and partial dynamical suppression ) and hopefully reasonably amenable to the naive @xmath43 extrapolation .",
    "the ads / cft dictionary @xcite relates the normalizable bulk modes @xmath44 to those interpolating fields of the dual gauge theory which have enhanced overlap with the corresponding hadrons .",
    "more specifically , in the scalar sector the conformal dimension @xmath45 of a meson interpolator prescribes the mass term in the potential ( [ vsw ] ) as    @xmath46    and thereby sets the @xmath47 boundary condition for its dual mode , i.e. for the solution of eq .",
    "( [ sleq ] ) . in the case of ordinary scalarmesons",
    "the quark - antiquark interpolator@xmath48is ( up to factors )  the unique choice with @xmath49 . for light scalar mesons with a dominant tetraquark component ,",
    "on the other hand , the larger number of possible couplings between the four quarks @xcite allows for several potential tetraquark interpolators with the minimal classical scaling dimension @xmath50 . in bottom - up duals",
    "it is therefore not _ a priori _ clear how to assign states to these interpolators . in the light of our above comments a natural choice , containing a good diquark and a good antidiquark ,",

    "the explicit form ( [ ti ] ) is just an illustrative example , however , and will not affect our results .",
    "indeed , for our purpose it suffices to specify the tetraquark interpolator s quantum numbers , its scaling dimension and the defining property of maximal overlap with the tetraquark ground state .",

    "the above pattern adequately reproduces the empirical mass hierarchy among the less strongly bound @xmath0 mesons ( with @xmath64 ) and scalar glueballs ( with @xmath68 ) . the exceptionally strong attraction required to reduce the masses of the lightest tetraquark nonet below those of the scalar @xmath0 ground state , on the other hand",
    ", is obviously not reflected in this minimal description . in the following",
    "we will examine whether the neglect of the tetraquark interpolator s anomalous dimension may be responsible for this shortcoming . as already mentioned , this would not be unexpected if the additional binding originates from the maximally attractive diquark channel because diquark - content - dependent anomalous dimensions of the nucleon interpolators were found to describe good - diquark binding effects in the light baryon spectrum @xcite ( on the basis of the metric soft - wall  gravity dual of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . indeed",

    ", we will therefore resort to a reasonable ansatz for @xmath76 and restrict it as tightly as possible by consistency , stability and physics requirements .",
    "this strategy can not directly relate the ensuing mass corrections ( [ m2 ] ) to the anomalous dimension in qcd , but it will provide quantitative orientation and general insights , especially on how much tetraquark binding the anomalous - dimension mechanism can generate in principle , and even lead to a rather unique semi - quantative guess for @xmath69 which is essentially independent of the specific ads / qcd dynamics ( [ act ] ) adopted to derive it .",

    "an adequate description of molecular - binding or meson - cloud effects could require to take bulk - mode interactions into account , moreover , and the resonance widths will further modify the masses .",

    "the higher tetraquark excitations turn out to be heavier than their @xmath0 counterparts , finally , so that their increasing widths ( due to increasingly many open decay channels , a larger phase space and potential dynamical enhancements ) should prevent them from generating more low - lying scalar resonances than experimentally seen .",
