    "there is now a long history of continuous progress in the understanding of electromagnetic form factors at large momentum transfer .",
    "after the pioneering works  @xcite leading to the celebrated quark counting rules , the understanding of hard scattering exclusive processes has been solidly founded by brodsky and lepage  @xcite .",
    "a perturbative qcd subprocess scaling like @xmath1 in the simplest case of the meson form factor is factorized from a wave function - like distribution amplitude @xmath2 ( @xmath3 being the light cone fraction of momentum carried by the valence quark ) , the @xmath0 dependence of which is analysed in the renormalization group approach .",
    "although an asymptotic expression emerges from this analysis for the @xmath3 dependence of the distribution : @xmath4 in the meson case , it was quickly understood that the evolution to the asymptotic @xmath0 is very slow and that indeed some non pertubative input is required to get reliable estimates of this distribution amplitude at measurable @xmath0 .",
    "thanks to the qcd sum rule approach , such a function was proposed by chernyak and zhitnitsky  @xcite , which were followed by other model dependent proposals  @xcite .",
    "these developments helped theoretical estimates to get closer to real experimental data but a severe criticism  @xcite remarked that most of the contributions to the form factor were coming from end - point regions in the @xmath3 integration , especially when very asymetric distribution amplitudes such as those of @xcite were used .",
    "this is not welcome since one may doubt the validity of the perturbative calculation in these regions .",
    "the recent work of li and sterman  @xcite solves this problem by proposing a modified factorization formula which takes into account sudakov suppression of elastic scattering for soft gluon exchange .",
    "this inclusion leads to an enlargement of the domain of applicability of ( improved ) peturbative qcd calculations of exclusive processes .",
    "the case of timelike form factors has not been much studied theoretically  @xcite .",
    "experimental data on the proton magnetic form factor @xmath5  @xcite show a definite difference between the spacelike and timelike values at the highest measured @xmath0 .",
    "a recent analysis of the @xmath6 decay  @xcite leads to a similar problem for the pion form factor at @xmath7 transfer .",
    "note , however , that the experimental extraction of the spacelike form factor has been recently suspected to suffer from large uncertainties  @xcite .    in this paper , we carefully analyse in the li - sterman framework @xcite the ratio between high @xmath0 timelike and spacelike meson form factors .",
    "not surprinsingly , we find that this ratio goes asymptotically to @xmath8 but we show that this approach to asymptotia is slow and that factors of the order of @xmath9 follow at measurable @xmath0 from reasonable assumptions on wave functions .",
    "in this section , we review the formalism as it has been developed for the spacelike case .",
    "the spacelike form factor measures the ability of a pion to absorb a virtual photon ( carrying a momentum @xmath10 with @xmath11 ) while remaining intact .",
    "it is defined by the formula : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the pion electric charge and momenta are defined in fig .",
    "[ sl - ff ] .    in the hard scattering regime , that is when @xmath14 is very high with respect to the low energy scales of the theory ( the qcd scale @xmath15 and the pion mass ) , brodsky and lepage have motivated the following three step picture for the process , valid in the light - front formalism  @xcite :    * the pion exhibits a valence quark - antiquark  soft  ( see below ) state , * which interacts with the hard photon leading to another soft state , * which forms the final pion .",
    "this leads to the convolution formula : @xmath16 and the graphical representation of fig .",
    "[ conv ] .",
    "the most important feature of this picture is that it separates hard from soft dynamics . the amplitude @xmath17 , the _ interaction _ , reflects the hard transformation due to the absorption of the photon and is hopefully calculable in perturbative qcd , because the effective couplings are small in this regime due to the asymptotic freedom .",
    "the amplitude @xmath18 , the _ wave function _ , which depends on low energy dynamics is outside of the domain of applicability of perturbative qcd and is , at present , far from being fully understood from the theory .",
    "it is however process independent and contains much information on confinement dynamics .",
    "factorization proofs legitimate this picture  @xcite .",
    "the need of a careful factorization is due to the infrared behavior of qcd : technically , large logarithms ( @xmath19 ) appear in the renormalized one - loop corrections to naive  tree - graph  ( @xmath20 is some infrared cut off needed to regularize soft and/or collinear divergences ) . as in the renormalization procedure , if factorization holds , these large corrections should be absorbed , here in the re - definition of the wave function .",
    "the proof of factorization and its consequences upon the wave functions are studied in the pattern of the renormalization group . without entering into a detailed discussion ,",
    "let us sketch the procedure ( see  @xcite for more on this leading logarithms calculation and also for the renormalization group treatment ) .",
    "the first step is to compute the naive hard amplitude , that is consider the tree graph of fig .",
    "[ tree - graph ] , and the three other graphs related to it by c and t symmetries .",
    "one finds , with notations explained on fig .",
    "[ tree - graph ] : @xmath21 where all quark momentum components are kept .",
    "note that we have done the usual projection onto the pion s wave state : @xmath22 and used the c symmetry of the wave function .",
    "@xmath23 is the color factor , while @xmath24 is the qcd effective coupling at the renormalization point @xmath25 .    to examine one loop corrections to @xmath17 , the relevant graphs to consider in light - cone gauge are those of fig .",
    "[ 1-loop ] .",
    "they directly lead to the wave function correction , in the ",
    "double logarithms  or sudakov region ( namely : @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 being respectively the light - cone fraction and transverse gluon momentum relatively to the pion ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and the first term in the difference comes from vertex - like corrections and the second one from self energy ones ; in the infrared region some partial cancellations occur between these corrections , but the cancellation is not complete .    to pursue this analysis ,",
    "it is convenient to define the fourier transform in the transverse plane : @xmath31 and to separate transverse and longitudinal variations of the wave function .",
    "one finds , omitting for the moment the second term in eq .",
    "( [ one - loop ] ) : @xmath32    this equation contains the typical corrections one has to consider in a hard process when dealing with either a big ( @xmath33 ) or a small ( @xmath34 ) neutral object .",
    "the transverse behavior at large distance is driven by the first term of the previous equation , thanks to the vanishing of the summation with the oscillating components .",
    "this occurs when @xmath35 is greater than at least a few times the inverse of the upper bound of the corresponding integral : @xmath36 . as a consequence , in the remaining expression , the infrared cut - off",
    "@xmath20 can be replaced by the natural one @xmath37 , above which the vextex and self energy corrections do not compensate one another .",
    "thus we get : @xmath38 with @xmath39 , @xmath40 being the number of quark flavors . here and in the following , it is understood that the energies and inverse separations are in the natural @xmath41 unit .",
    "we have kept the single log term which occurs in the integration , because it is the one necessary to express the true _ dominant",
    "_ large @xmath42 suppression , which one obtains in a more complete treatment ( that is leading and next to leading one )  @xcite .    after the ressummation of the ladder structure to all order , the above sudakov factor exponentiates . taking into account the term obtained with the substitution @xmath43",
    ", we get : @xmath44    thus we get a strong suppression of the effective wave function as @xmath45 , whatever the fraction @xmath3 is , provided that @xmath14 is reasonably large .    the remaining object",
    "@xmath46 is a soft component to start with .",
    "it is soft in the sense that it does not include loop - corrections harder than @xmath37 .",
    "one may modelize it by including some @xmath42 behavior or simply relate it to the distribution amplitude  @xcite setting : @xmath47      the first term in eq .",
    "( [ one - loop - b ] ) is negligible when the oscillating term remains close to @xmath8 in the range of integration .",
    "this happens for @xmath42 a few times less than @xmath48 . in this case ,",
    "soft divergences cancel one another and one finds : @xmath49 with the notation : @xmath50    we displayed this equation in a slightly different form than in the large @xmath42 case to explicitly show that eq .",
    "( [ one - loop ] ) , in the limit of small @xmath42 , is related to the distribution evolution proposed in  @xcite .",
    "let us shortly review how this comes .",
    "brodsky and lepage had proposed a simpler factorization formula for exclusive processes  @xcite .",
    "it is easily derived from the previous treatment if one assumes that neither the wave function nor the hard amplitude give important contribution to the form  factor when the transverse momenta are big . neglecting all transverse momenta in @xmath17",
    "leads therefore to consider the @xmath51-integrated quantity : @xmath52    this distribution amplitude related to the wave function at @xmath53 has a dependence in @xmath14 associated with the remaining collinear divergences in eq .",
    "( [ one - loop - small - b ] ) .",
    "indeed , the exponentiated form of this convolution equation , once it is written for the distribution @xmath54 and generalized to other regions than the sudakov one , leads to the celebrated expansion of @xmath55 in a linear combination of a running logarithm together with a gegenbauer polynomial .",
    "however , whereas this slow evolution is predictible , the expansion at some finite @xmath14 is inaccessible from perturbative reasoning .",
    "in the timelike region , the hard process ruling @xmath56 is drawn in fig .",
    "[ tl - ff ] and the hard amplitude is simple to deduce from the spacelike formula ( [ space - like ] ) changing @xmath57 or @xmath58 . the new feature with respect to the spacelike form factor is that the contour of transverse momenta integration now goes near poles located at either : @xmath59 or : @xmath60 .",
    "these poles are automatically ignored in the pattern of the brodsky lepage formalism as being to far from the contributing region of integration . however , whereas this argument is reasonable at asymptotic regime , we can expect some consequences of the presence of these singularities when the energy is not so high .",
    "technically , these poles are , except in the end point regions ( @xmath61 ) , far from the bounds of integration of the two independant variables @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , we may evaluate the integral by deforming the contour of integration in the complex plane of each of these variables .",
    "another question one may worry about , is the physical origin of these poles .",
    "a complete physical amplitude , for example the form  factor @xmath64 , considered for complex value of @xmath0 , has poles and cut along the real negative axis reflecting the existence of intermediate physical ( on mass shell ) states .",
    "these intermediate states are hadronic ones and therefore correspond to the  asymptotical  objects of confined qcd .",
    "the poles we encounter in our present computation , internal gluon or quark lines going on mass shell , of course , do not correspond to observable states .",
    "however they only appear in a differential amplitude which itself is not observable.provided , this differential amplitude is integrable , the resulting form factor will only contain , as a remainder of this kind of singularities , a real and imaginary parts which one would also expect in a purely hadronic computation .      the sudakov suppression is likely to be important at timelike transfer , so it is necessary to take the transverse fourier transform of the hard amplitude .",
    "furthermore , whenever this is possible , it is interesting to get an expression not only for negative @xmath65 or positive @xmath66 , but also for complex values of the generalized transfer . let us define @xmath67 $ ] , so that in the spacelike side of the complex plane , we get : @xmath68 whereas in the timelike side : @xmath69 .    the expression of the form factor , with the fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ space - like ] ) and the replacement of @xmath14 by @xmath70 , is : @xmath71 where angular integrations have been done thanks to the cylindrical symmetry of both hard amplitude and s wave wave function . @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the transverse distances of , respectively , the gluon vertex and the internal quark vertex .",
    "the functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 are modified bessel functions of order 0 , the first appearing in the equation comes from the gluon propagator , while the remainder comes from the quark propagator .",
    "bessel functions have different asymptotic behaviors in various directions of the complex plane : for @xmath76 $ ] we have  @xcite , @xmath77 we thus have to study how the asymptotic dependence of the form factor is affected by this direction .",
    "in particular in the timelike limit , the integrand is no more exponentially suppressed .",
    "there is , _ a priori _ , no general constraint to ensure that the limit of some observable like a form factor should be the same in every directions in the complex plane . even though @xmath78 is analytic and : @xmath79 with the limit : @xmath80 , our ignorance of the true form of @xmath81 prevents us from concluding when another direction is considered .",
    "however , because one expects that the same kind of physics underlies exclusive processes , we expect that , at least in an asymptotic regime , we should find , for the leading behavior , the overlapping of exactly the same soft and hard amplitudes .    as a first step in the understanding of the features of the whole form factor",
    ", we may evaluate the @xmath42 integrals in an analytical way , putting a simple form for the wave function : @xmath82 which automatically provides a cut - off to avoid indefinite integral .",
    "we also forget here the possible running of the coupling with transverse distances ( see subsection  [ comparison ] ) which appears with sudakov suppression , here ignored .    with these simplifications ,",
    "one finds for the integral over @xmath83 and @xmath72 :    @xmath84    with @xmath85 a function that we refrain from quoting here due to its lack of interest , except for its generic behavior for large @xmath86 : @xmath87 .    as long as we avoid the timelike limit , we find the following leading behavior for the integration in the transverse plane : @xmath88 which displays the expected selection of small configuration by the hard process .    in the timelike region ,",
    "this is no more true , as we get a modified power dependence : @xmath89 with the appearance of the size @xmath90 , together with an oscillating factor .",
    "of course , we suspect here that we have found essentially the limit of our model object ; nevertheless , we may anticipate that some reminiscence of this rather different behavior will occur in the non asymptotic regime .",
    "a source of modification to the above result is the transverse behavior of the wave function .",
    "the rectangular form which we have choosen above and its steep variation reduces the occurence of cancellations expected with an oscillating integrand .",
    "if we were speaking of fourier - transform we would say that a rectangular function has relatively large components at large momenta in comparison with any similar but smoother function .",
    "the sudakov behavior reviewed in the second section plays this role .",
    "however , due to the transfer dependence of the sudakov factor , we must firstly face the problem of its analytic continuation  @xcite .    before turning to this analytic continuation ,",
    "we rewrite the expression of @xmath66 from eq .",
    "( [ one - loop - large - b ] ) for spacelike transfer , in the form : @xmath91 to explicitly see that @xmath66 increases rapidly with @xmath92 at large @xmath14 ( remember that if @xmath3 is small , we can always consider the @xmath93-term in turn ) so that the region of not too large suppression is @xmath94 , where we have : @xmath95    for large timelike transfer , setting @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ s(x , q , b ) ] ) , we get :    @xmath97    with @xmath98 and @xmath99 the spacelike expression of eq .",
    "( [ s(x , q , b ) ] ) . in the above equation ,",
    "the real part is effectively small , while the imaginary part remains close to @xmath100 in the region of intermediate suppression .",
    "we can therefore assume , in the asymptotic regime , the same scale dependence for the sudakov factor and use the expression @xmath98 for our study .    to simplify our purpose ,",
    "we will concentrate on the simpler case one gets by considering only the transverse behavior of the gluon propagator , that is setting the transverse momentum to @xmath101 in eq .",
    "( [ space - like ] ) .",
    "as we will show , this does not alter the naive behavior we previously get .",
    "however when taking the fourier transform , only one transverse distance remains , @xmath102 and after angular integration we are led to replace the integral i in eq .",
    "( [ asymptotic ] ) by the quantity @xmath103 : @xmath104 where we have limited our study to the @xmath105 case .",
    "thanks to the sudakov suppression , the upper bound of the integral is naturally @xmath106 .    for the sudakov exponent , we consider the approximate expression of section  [ the spacelike form factor ] with the prescription of li and sterman  @xcite which is to set the exponential to unity in the region that should not be controled by sudakov evolution , here for @xmath107 . with these simplifications ,",
    "we get : @xmath108 which is to be compared with the expression without sudakov correction : @xmath109    we present in fig .",
    "[ as ] the result of a numerical computation for both the real part ( a ) and the modulus ( b ) of the quantity @xmath110 which dictates the deviation from the counting rule canonical result and compare it to the original quantity @xmath111 .",
    "we observe that after an intermediate regime ( @xmath112 ) , the expressions including sudakov suppression slowly decrease to @xmath100 contrary to the case of the rectangular wave function .",
    "another feature we have omited until now is the fact that the expression for the form factor is a superposition of amplitude with various fractions @xmath113 weighted by smooth distributions .",
    "this should also modify the @xmath114-power law and we examine this possibility in appendix a.    we conclude that the @xmath114 behavior does not resist to the inclusion of any realistic @xmath42 or @xmath3-@xmath115 integration procedure .",
    "indeed the dimensional counting rules are valid at timelike transfers and furthermore the form factors are asymptotically the same .",
    "let us now turn to the discussion of the ratio of timelike over spacelike form factors in the intermediate range .",
    "the complete integration formula is : @xmath116 with the hard scattering amplitude from eq .",
    "( [ timelike ] ) : @xmath117 .",
    "the integration range for the longitudinal fraction of momentum goes from @xmath100 to @xmath8 , whereas transverse distances it go from @xmath100 to @xmath118 thanks to the sudakov suppression at large @xmath42 .    for the numerical study , we take into account the one loop running of the qcd coupling in the hard scattering : @xmath119 with the prescription for the renormalization point described in  @xcite and @xmath120 .",
    "the sudakov factor @xmath121 contains the corrections for the two wave functions together with the anomalous running of the four quark operator @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the sudakov factor should be analytically continued as discussed in sub - section  [ asymptotic behavior ]  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that this procedure leads to quite model - dependent results at non asymptotic transfers .",
    "this has to do with the truncation of the exponentiated expression and with the need to suspect the validity of the approach when the ( real part of the ) sudakov exponent becomes positive , i.e. when sudakov suppression turns to an enhancement .",
    "we leave to appendix b a somewhat detailed discussion of these effects , the conclusion being that an extra modification of the timelike value may come from this continuated sudakov exponential , but that it is quite difficult to reliably quantify this statement . in the following",
    ", we will thus keep the sudakov factor at its spacelike ( real ) value .",
    "we used various forms for the soft wave function @xmath122 to test the sensitivity of the result to this input .",
    "one may consider wave functions without intrisic transverse behavior ( @xmath123 ) and use either the asymptotic form : @xmath124 with @xmath125 the pion decay constant , the cz form : @xmath126 or other expansions in terms of gegenbauer polynomials like those proposed in  @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will show some results for one form  @xcite : @xmath127    as mentioned in section  [ the spacelike form factor ] , the two last distributions have slow logarithmic evolution with @xmath14 .",
    "we ignore this evolution because it is quite insignificant in the range of energy we consider here .",
    "following  @xcite , one may also include some intrinsic transverse behavior .",
    "we tried the different forms of wave functions described in  @xcite and found only small differences for the behavior of the ratio .",
    "therefore , we only quote here the sample form for which we will show some results in the following : @xmath128 which is a simple way to modelize the transverse behavior without a long set of parameters . @xmath129 related to the valence state radius is proposed in  @xcite : @xmath130 .",

    "the inclusion of the intrinsic @xmath42-dependence given by eq .",
    "( [ psi - transverse ] ) ( dashed lines ) does not significantly modify the results .    in fig .",
    "[ distr](a ) , the modulus of the timelike form factor ( multiplied by @xmath0 ) is shown for the three choices of distribution amplitudes : cz form ( solid line ) , asymptotic one ( dashed line ) and fhz one ( long - dashed line ) . the experimental data shown comes from @xmath136 decay  @xcite .",
    "sudakov suppression has been included but no intrinsic @xmath42-dependence .",
    "[ distr](b ) shows the ratio of the timelike to the spacelike form factors .",
    "this ratio is rather wave function independent and decreases very slowly to @xmath8 from a value of around @xmath9 in most of the experimentally accessible range .",
    "although this ratio turns out to be quite difficult to reliably extract from experimental data in the meson case , it is quite straightforwardly measured in the proton case .",
    "we will analyse the proton case in a forthcoming work .",
    "if we restrict to a simple quark - diquark picture , we would get a timelike to spacelike ratio quite similar to the one obtained here for the meson case , and thus understand the experimental value .",
    "in this paper , we showed that the difference between spacelike and timelike form factors at large accessible transfer is predictible from an improved perturbative qcd analysis .",
    "we understand at least qualitatively the enhancement of the timelike values at large but non asymptotic transfers as mostly due to the integrable singularities of gluon and quark propagators .",
    "this strengthens the faith in the applicability of perturbative reasoning at intermediate energies ( above a few gev ) at least for semi - quantitative understanding of the strong interaction physics .    for the pion case ,",
    "the uncertainties in the extraction of the spacelike form factor  @xcite show the need for another way to access this observable , the simplest one in exclusive scattering .",
    "we demonstrated that the usual formalism of brodsky and lepage has to be improved to account for the differences between timelike and spacelike regions in the energy range experimentally reachable .",
    "more experimental data are still needed to test our knowledge of the pion wave function .",
    "the proton case is more interesting since the extraction of the spacelike form factor is without ambiguity .",
    "the comparison of spacelike and timelike form factors thus appears to be a good way to understand the hadronic wave function .",
    "many other hard exclusive processes dwell on timelike transfers .",
    "the @xmath137 reactions at fixed angle for instance demand a more careful analysis than available now , not to speak of the difficult instances where pinch singular diagrams mix up , as in the ratio of @xmath138 to @xmath139 elastic scattering .",
    "more work needs to be done and experimentally tested before we know for sure that exclusive timelike reactions help us to understand confinement dynamics through the unraveling of hadron wave functions in their lowest fock state .",

    "we give in this appendix some arguments for the power suppression of the oscillating factor we get in sub - section  [ asymptotic behavior ] .",
    "again we will concentrate on the simple case one has when neglecting the transverse momentum in the quark propagator ( see sub - section  [ asymptotic behavior ] ) and consider the integral analogous to @xmath140 in eq .",
    "( [ asymptotic ] ) : @xmath141    as in section [ the timelike form factor ] , we should worry about the behavior of the bessel function with large argument ( @xmath142 has the same asymptotic behavior as @xmath74 ) .",

    "the presence of any smooth distribution as weight functions will not destroy this feature . to see this explicitely we can perform the integration over some finite range for @xmath3 to avoid region where the asymptotic form fails and also to allow further simplifications .",

    "however , the previous equation , even if approximatively , still indicates qualitatively that this identical asymptotic behavior may be reached rather slowly .",
    "we discuss in this appendix the analytic continuation of the sudakov suppression factor .    in the complete expression for the form factor eq .",
    "( [ f expression ] ) , two factors : @xmath17 and @xmath121 , are scale dependent and must _ a priori _ be analytically continued . in sub - section  [ asymptotic behavior ] , we give some arguments to show that the sudakov factor has a leading behavior which is not affected by analytic continuation so that we can study the contribution to timelike form factor ignoring this kind of difficulties .",

    "the spacelike sudakov suppression , li and sterman  @xcite choose to include the exponential factor only in the region of large @xmath42 defined by @xmath153 and furthermore only when the sum of all exponents is negative and leads effectively to a suppression .",
    "the first prescription is associated with approximations discussed in section  [ the spacelike form factor ] and we will not questioned it in the following . in the spacelike case , it appears that the second constraint may be easily relaxed in a numerical study , because only a very small enhancement results when forgetting this constraint .",
