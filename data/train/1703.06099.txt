    "studies of artificial molecules formed by carrier orbitals extended over double quantum dots ( dqds ) @xcite focus on carrier tunneling and interactions .",
    "a particular attention is payed to the spin - related phenomena in the context of the quantum information processing @xcite using exchange interaction due to the interdot coupling @xcite .",
    "the coupling with nuclear spins @xcite which limits the electron spin coherence times motivated studies of dqds with holes as spin carriers @xcite as well as on systems based on silicon @xcite and carbon , including nanotubes @xcite and graphene @xcite . in graphene the carrier storage is hampered by the klein tunneling @xcite but for nanoribbons the lateral confinement opens the transport gap @xcite that makes the carrier storage possible @xcite .",
    "quantum dots in ribbons are influenced by edge effects and disorder @xcite .",
    "an alternative medium is the bilayer graphene @xcite for which the perpendicular electric field opens the band gap @xcite in the energy spectrum and allows for carrier confinement by lateral fields @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider the bilayer graphene @xcite and  in particular  formation of extended orbitals within the dqds . in",
    "the low - energy continuum approach hamiltonian eigenstates possess a definite total angular momentum @xcite with a different orbital angular momentum for each of the four sublattices described by the wave function components . as we discuss below for a lower  point symmetry of the dqd system",
    " the hamiltonian eigenstates components correspond to opposite spatial parities for each of the sublattices .",
    "thus wave function can be bonding on one sublattice and antibonding on the other .",
    "the effect induces a complex dependence of the spectrum on the dqd distance that is similar to the antibonding heavy hole ground state found for vertical self - assembled quantum dots @xcite .    in the low energy part of the two - electron spectrum for the weak coupling case - the typical one for the electrostatic quantum dots  the electrons are localized in separate qds and the ground state at zero magnetic field @xmath0",
    "is nearly 16-times degenerate with respect to the valley and the spin . for nonzero magnetic field",
    "the energy levels correspond to wave function that can be approximately described by a product of the spatial , valley and spin components . only the symmetry of the spatial part against the electron interchange influences the energy of the states , and we find that the energy levels shift in pairs with @xmath0 that correspond to the opposite symmetry split by the exchange integral . in the high energy part of the spectrum the states corresponding to both electrons in the same dot are found .",
    "these energy levels also shift in @xmath0 in pairs which is a manifestation of a collective two - electron intedot tunneling that forms bonding and antibonding two - electron orbitals . for stronger interdot coupling the dqd spectrum",
    "resembles the one of a single quantum dot with a ground state triplet @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the theory section ( ii )",
    "we describe the model system , the atomistic and continuum approaches , as well as the configuration interaction method for the electron pair . in section iii",
    "we discuss formation of the extended orbitals and their nature as artificial molecular states and next we discuss the spatial , spin and orbital symmetries of the two - electron states .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "we consider a flake in form of a stretched hexagon ( see fig .",

    "we consider two sizes of the flake .",
    "the smaller flake has a length of @xmath1 nm and height @xmath2 nm , with the horizontal edge length of @xmath3 nm , and the total number of carbon atoms @xmath4 , while the larger flake is characterized by @xmath5 nm , @xmath6 nm , @xmath7 nm , and contains @xmath8 atoms .    the flake possesses the armchair boundary  for which no edge - localized energy levels appear in the spectrum at the neutrality point @xcite .",
    "the quantum dots for electrons of the conduction band are defined by external potential which is taken in form @xmath9 where the origin ( @xmath10 ) is placed in the center of the flake , @xmath11 is the quantum dots depth , @xmath12 is the effective radius and @xmath13 is distance between the centers of the qds . in this work ,",
    "we fix @xmath12 at @xmath14 nm , for this value the wave functions localized in the dots vanish off the edges of the larger flake - for which the valley mixing effect of the armchair edge is negligible . for the smaller flake",
    "the effect of the edge for the confined states is still present and we use this fact below for description of the valley mixing effects on the single- and the two - electron spectra .     represented by blue circles .",
    "we consider the flake of two sizes .",
    "the length of the smaller system is @xmath1 nm , the height is @xmath2 nm and the longer edge has length of @xmath3 nm , while the parameters for the larger are @xmath5 nm , @xmath6 nm and @xmath7 nm . ]      for most of the calculations we use the atomistic tight - binding hamiltonian @xcite given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath18 at ion @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the hopping parameter . at zero magnetic field",
    "the hopping parameter takes the value of @xmath21 ev for the in - plane nearest neighbor atoms and @xmath22 ev for the vertical dimers between the layers @xcite . in order to account for the magnetic field perpendicular to the layers we include the peierls phase into the hopping parameters , @xmath23 where @xmath24 with @xmath25",

    "the hamiltonian commutes with a generalized parity operator @xmath49 where @xmath50 changes the sign of the spatial coordinates of scalar functions @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the @xmath53 identity matrix .    for a single circular quantum dot the total angular momentum operator @xmath54 commutes with the hamiltonian @xcite , where @xmath55 is the angular momentum operator .",
    "the second term is the layer index operator with @xmath46 defined by ( [ layeri ] ) .",
    "the last term corresponds to the pseudospin @xcite .    in order to find the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ hdirac ] ) we use the finite element method with triangular elements and cubic shape functions .",

    "@xmath59 parameter was fine - tuned to remove the spurious solutions from the discussed energy range leaving the actual states nearly unaffected .",
    "the wave functions obtained with the tight - binding approach are used in the configuration interaction method @xcite . the atomistic approach when applied to the exact diagonalization method naturally accounts for the intervalley scattering induced by the short range component of the coulomb interaction @xcite .    for the description of the two - electron states we use the solution of the one - electron eigenproblem ( [ hone ] ) .",
