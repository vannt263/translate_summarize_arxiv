    "recent investigations have shown that a fourth generation is not ruled out by the precision electroweak data if it is heavy with masses in the few hundred gev range ( for recent works see @xcite and for early works see @xcite ) .",
    "these investigations have typically assumed that the fourth generation is a sequential generation with @xmath1 type interactions .",
    "however , an intriguing possibility exists that the new generation could be a mirror generation with @xmath0 interactions .",
    "mirror generations do arise in unified models of fundamental interactions@xcite , and thus it is natural that one consider the existence of a mirror generation .",
    "normally one assumes the so called survival hypothesis@xcite where with @xmath4 number of ordinary families and @xmath5 number of mirror families , only @xmath6 ( for @xmath7 ) remain light , and the remainder acquire gut or string scale size masses .",
    "however , this need not always be the case .",
    "indeed there are many escape mechanisms where residual symmetries in breaking at the string scale or gut scale will keep some mirror families light while others become superheavy @xcite",
    ". mixings between ordinary families and mirrors can arise from non - rernormalizable interactions after spontaneous breaking ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "additional work on model building using mirrors can be found in @xcite and further implications of mirrors are explored in @xcite .",
    "+ in this work we make the specific assumption that there is indeed a light mirror generation with masses below the tev scale which would be accessible at the lhc .",
    "the assumption of a full mirror generation leaves the theory anomaly free .",
    "essentially all of the analyses valid for a sequential fourth generation regarding consistency with the precision electroweak data and other constraints should be valid for a mirror generation and we assume this to be the case .",
    "the analysis we present here differs from previous works in many respects .",
    "first we propose an extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with a full mirror generation which is light ( mirmssm ) , i.e. , with masses below the tev scale which will be accessible at the lhc .",
    "such an extension is not considered in any of the previous works .",
    "indeed most of the previous analyses are not in supersymmetric frameworks .",
    "second we assume that the mixings of the mirror generation occur mostly with the third generation , and are negligible with the first two generations if they occur at all .",
    "with this assumption , the @xmath1 structure of the weak interactions for the first two generations remains intact , while the third generation can develop a small @xmath0 component .",
    "current data on the third generation do not necessarily rule out this possibility .",
    "+ if a mirror generation exists , it would be discovered at the lhc with the same amount of luminosity as for the a sequential fourth generation which is estimated to be @xmath8 . a mirror generation will lead to interesting and even dramatic multilepton and jets signatures which can discriminate between a mirror generation and a sequential fourth generation .",
    "further , tests of the mirror generation can come from the decay of the heavy higgs and via measurements of the forward -backward asymmetry .",
    "another effect of the mixings of the mirror generation with the third generation is on magnetic moments .",
    "we analyze these in the leptonic sector in detail and show that the tau neutrino magnetic moment is enhanced by several orders of magnitude beyond what one has in the standard model .",
    "we note in passing that the term mirror has also been used in an entirely different context of mirror worlds@xcite where one has mirror matter with their own mirror gauge group .",
    "the analysis here has no relationship with those theories .",
    "+ the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows . in sec.(2 ) we present an extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) to include a fourth generation which we assume is a mirror generation and allow for a mixing of this generation with the 3rd generation . here the interactions in the charged and neutral current sectors are worked out including the supersymmetric interactions involving the mirrors , the chargions and the neutralinos .",
    "further details of mixing and interactions are given in appendix a. an analysis of the @xmath9 neutrino magnetic moment is given in sec.(3 ) . here",
    "contributions arise from exchanges of the leptons from the third generation and from the mirror generation , and also from the exchanges of the sleptons and mirror sleptons .",
    "an analysis of the @xmath9-lepton anomalous magnetic moment when mixings with the mirror family are allowed is given in sec.(4 ) again including exchanges from the 3rd generation leptons and sleptons and from the mirror leptons and mirror sleptons .",
    "a discussion of the constraints on a mirror generation and a quantitative analysis of the sizes is given in sec.(5 ) in the framework of an extended supergravity unified model@xcite which includes the mirror sector . when compared with the magnetic moment analyses in mssm with or without cp",
    "violation@xcite one finds that the tau neutrino magnetic moment can be orders of magnitude larger than in the standard model while the magnetic moment of the tau lies within experimental bounds .",
    "a qualitative analysis of the signatures of the mirror generation at the lhc is given in sec.(6 ) .",
    "here it is shown that some characteristic signatures arise , such as dominance of @xmath9s in the decay patterns of the mirror leptons which should allow one to discriminate this model from other supersymmetric models .",
    "further , we discuss how one may distinguish a mirror generation from a sequential fourth generation . here aside from the leptonic signatures , the decay of the heavy higgs bosons , and the analysis of the forward - backward asymmetry would allow one to discriminate a mirror generation from a sequential fourth generation .",
    "further details of the decay of heavy higgs to mirror fermions are given in appendix b. conclusions are given in sec.(7 ) .",
    "the fourth generation which we assume to be mirror will in general mix with the other three generations . however , as is the case for the first three generations the mixings between the generations get smaller as the ratio of the masses get further apart .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath10 , and we expect a similar phenomenon for mixings involving the fourth ( mirror ) generation , i.e. , we expect @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the 4th ( mirror ) generation bottom quark . as an example",
    ", the mixing between the first and the second can be estimated by the gatto - sartori - tonin - oakes relation@xcite @xmath13 which gives @xmath14 to be about @xmath15 .",
    "the mixing of the first with the third can be very roughly estimated so that @xmath16 which gives about @xmath17 , i.e. , a factor about 10 smaller than @xmath14@xcite . ] .",
    "if we extend this rough estimate to the fourth generation one will have mixing between the first and the fourth as @xmath18(for @xmath19 gev ) .",
    "assuming similar mixings will hold in the leptonic sector one will have mixings between the first and the fourth as @xmath20 ( for @xmath21=200 gev ) where @xmath22 is the 4th ( mirror ) generation lepton .",
    "more detailed analyses using error bars on electroweak data show that the constraints on the enlarged ckm matrix are more relaxed@xcite ( see also sec.v ) .",
    "conversely it means that with the current limits on the mixing angles the effects of the 4th generation on the analysis of the electroweak data lie well within the error bars . here",
    "the electroweak parameters which require special attention are the s , t , u variables where larger contributions from the 4th generation are possible , but still the data can be made compatible with a 4th generation . returning to the mixing of the 4th generation with the first two one can easily check that small mixings of the type discussed above lead to negligible effect of the 4th generation on the phenomenology of the first two generations . for this reason we will make a simplifying assumption of neglecting the mixing effects of the fourth with the first two generations and consider below the mixing of just the third and the fourth .",
    "however , the following analysis can be straightforwardly extended to the full four generations by letting the generation index run from 1 - 4 keeping in mind that the 4th generation is a mirror generation .",
    "thus under @xmath23 the leptons transform as follows    _ l (    c _",
    "l    ) ~(1,2,- ) , ^c_l~(1,1,1 ) , ^c_l~(1,1,0 ) , where the last entry on the right hand side of each @xmath24 is the value of the hypercharge @xmath25 defined so that @xmath26 .",
    "these leptons have @xmath1 interactions .",

    "the numerical sizes of @xmath134 are discussed in in the next section .",
    "there are severe phenomenological constraints on extra matter beyond the standard model .",
    "these constraints can be listed as follows : ( 1 ) constraints from the data on the z width ; ( 2 ) constraints from direct searches ; ( 3 ) unitarity constraints on the enlarged @xmath135 ckm matrix ; ( 4 ) constraints from the oblique electroweak effects ; and ( 5 ) constraints on yukawas arising from keeping the theory perturbative , i.e. , avoid developing a landau pole .",
    "many of these constraints have been investigated in the context of a sequential fourth generation @xcite with the analysis of @xcite being the most recent and the most detailed .",
    "we summarize the main results of these analyses below .",
    "first of all the constraint ( 1 ) can be easily avoided by making the masses of the new particles greater than half the z boson width , while ( 2 ) can be satisfied by putting lower bounds on new matter from all collider data .",
    "for example , the lep ii data puts bounds on charged leptons of about a 100 gev , while the tevatron puts bounds on the fourth generation quark masses so that @xcite that @xmath136 gev ( 95% cl ) and @xmath137 gev ( at 95% cl ) .",
    "( 3 ) regarding the ckm unitarity constraints the enlarged ckm matrix allows a small window for mixings with the fourth generation so that @xcite @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and there are similar constraints on the other mixings which allow for non - negligible elements for mixings with the 4th generation .",
    "+ perhaps the most stringent of the constraint is ( 4 ) which comes from the oblique parameters @xmath141@xcite and specfically from the oblique parameter @xmath142 ( for a recent review of the s , t , u fits to the electroweak data see ref.@xcite ) . here a complete fourth generation with degenerate masses gives a contribution of about 0.2 .",
    "however , this correction can be reduced when one considers splittings of the up and the down fermions in the same multiplet . using such splittings analyses including the fourth generation",
    "allow for consistent @xmath141 fits to the data ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "( 5 ) finally it has been shown that the yukawa couplings can remain perturbative up to the grand unification scale for a range of fourth generation masses and higgs boson parameters .",
    "thus problems such as generation of landau pole singularities for a large 4th generation up quark mass can be avoided with appropriate parameter choices .",
    "essentially all of the considerations valid for the sequential fourth generation are also valid for the a mirror generation .",
    "thus for , example , consider a fourth generation with up and down fermions @xmath143 with hypercharge @xmath25 and masses @xmath144 .",
    "the transformation that takes us from fermions to mirror fermions is  ( _ 1 , _ 2 )  ( ^c_2 , ^c_1 ) , + y -y , m_1 m_2 .   [ transformation ] using the above one finds that @xmath145 contribution from the mirror generation is the same as for the 4th sequential generation@xcite . without going into further details , we assume that fits to the electroweak data similar to those for the sequential fourth generation can be carried out for the case of the mirror generation .",
    "+ beyond the constraints on a new generation discussed above a mirror generation encounters two more issues .",
    "the first concerns avoidance of the survival hypothesis@xcite , i.e. , a mirror generation and an ordinary generation can combine to get super heavy masses of gut size or string scale size .",
    "however , it is well known that some of the mirror generations do escape gaining super heavy masses and remain light up to the electroweak scale@xcite .",
    "we assume in this analysis that this indeed is the case for one mirror generation .",
    "the second issue concerns the mixing of the mirror generation with the ordinary generations . in this work",
    "we assume that the mixing primarily occurs with the third generation . in this circumstance",
    "the third generation will develop a small @xmath0 structure in addition to the expected @xmath1 structure .",
    "indeed such a @xmath0 component for some of the third generation particles has been looked at for some time@xcite .",
    "we here point out that the current data regarding the third generation leaves open the possibility of new physics .",
    "for instance , the analysis of @xcite finds a better fit to the precision electroweak data , and specifically a better fit to the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath146 of the b -quark , with additional bottom like quarks .",
    "similarly , a model - independent measurement of the w boson helicity in the top quark decay @xmath147 at d  @xcite , gives for the longitudinal fraction @xmath148 and for the right handed fraction @xmath149 the result @xmath150 and @xmath151 while @xmath152 is determined via the constraint @xmath153 .",

    "the above leads to some interesting features that distinguish a mirror generation from a sequential fourth generation .",
    "one important consequence of the above is the following .",
    "suppose the @xmath292 is heavy enough to decay into a pair of fourth generation quarks or a pair of mirror quarks ( @xmath300 ) .",
    "then let us define the ratio of branching ratios @xmath301 as r_d_4/u_4^h^0= br(h^0d_4|d_4)/ br(h^0u_4|u_4 ) . using the vertices in eq.([h01 ] ) we find r_d_4/u_4^h^0= ( ) ^2 p_d_4/u_4^h^0 , where @xmath302 is a phase space factor defined by @xmath303 ( see appendix b ) . similarly if the heavy higgs can decay into the mirror quarks ( @xmath304 ) one has",
    "r_b / t^h^0= ( ) ^2 p_b / t^h^0 , where we have neglected the loop effects . thus with a knowledge of the parameters of the higgs sector , i.e. , @xmath297 and @xmath298 one has a way of differentiating a mirror generation from a sequential fourth generation .",
    "even a more dramatic differentiation arises from the branching ratios involving the decay of the cp odd higgs . here",
    "one finds r_d_4/u_4^a^0 = ^4p_d_4/u_4^a^0 , where @xmath305 while a similar ratio for the decay into the mirror quarks gives ( see appendix b ) r_b / t^a^0 = ^4p_b / t^a^0 , where again we have neglected possible loop effects .",
    "the above implies that for @xmath306 , @xmath293 will dominantly decay into @xmath307 for the sequential fourth generation case , while it will decay dominantly into @xmath308 for a mirror generation .",
    "another important way to discriminate between a sequential generation and a mirror generation is to look at the forward backward asymmetry .",
    "thus for the process @xmath309 one may define , the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath310 = @xmath311 - @xmath312 @xmath313 @xmath314 .",
    "this asymmetry is sensitive to the @xmath0 vs @xmath1 structure of the @xmath315 fermion interaction and a measurement of it can help discriminate between a sequential generation and a mirror generation . in the above we",
    "have given a broad outline of the ways in which one might distinguish a mirror generation from a sequential fourth generation .",
    "there are many other possible chains for decay of the mirrors and mirror sparticles depending on their mass patterns .",
    "further , more detailed analyses of signatures for the model with mirrors based on detector simulations would be useful along the line of the analysis of signatures for sugra models@xcite and for string models ( for , a sample of recent works see@xcite ) .",
    "finally we comment on the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) issues .",
    "it is well known that mixing with mirrors frustrates the gim mechanism which suppresses fcnc . for the current model",
    "this does not pose a problem because the mirrors do not mix with the first two generations . on the other hand",
    "one does have couplings of the @xmath316 boson which are off diagonal , @xmath317 , @xmath318 , @xmath319 etc which would allow production via a drell -yan process of @xmath320 etc , which are not allowed for a sequential generation .",
    "of course the processes are suppressed by mixing angles .",
    "in this work we consider an extension of mssm with an extra mirror generation which remains light down to the electroweak scale .",
    "recent analyses indicate that an extra sequential generation is not inconsistent with the precision electroweak data , and similar considerations apply to a mirror generation . in the model we consider ,",
    "we allow for mixings of the mirror generation with the third generation , and investigate some of the phenomenological implications of the model .",
    "one important effect arises on the magnetic moment of the @xmath9 neutrino , where one finds that it is enhanced by up to eight to nine orders of magnitude over what is predicted in the standard model .",
    "we also discussed the possible signatures of the mirror generation at the lhc , and find that several characteristic signatures exist which would distinguish it from a sequential generation .",
    "one such crucial test is the measurement of the forward -backward asymmetry which can discriminate between the @xmath1 vs @xmath0 interactions .",
    "it is further shown that the couplings of the mirror generation have different @xmath299 dependences than those of an ordinary generation or of a sequential 4th generation .",
    "+ if a mirror generation exists , it has important implications for string model building .",
    "( for some recent work in d brane and string model building see @xcite ) . typically in string model building one puts in the constraints that the difference between the number of generations @xmath4 and the mirror generations @xmath5 ( with @xmath321 equal three .",
    "this assumes that the @xmath5 number of generations and mirror generations follow the survival hypothesis @xcite and become superheavy .",
    "however , in unified models there are many instances where mirror generations may remain massless up to the electroweak scale .",
    "this opens a new direction for model building .",
    "suppose , then , that one imposes only the constraint @xmath322 along with the condition that one mirror generation remains massless down to the electroweak scale .",
    "in this case we will have three ordinary generations and one mirror generation all light at the electroweak scale , i.e. , the extended mssm model with mirrors .",
    "+ if the scenario outlined above holds , the string model building may need a revision in that the constraint of three massless generations will be relaxed .",
    "specifically , for example , in kac - moody level 2 heterotic string constructions one has problems getting 3 massless generations ( see , e.g . , @xcite ) . on the other hand , if 3 ordinary generations and one mirror generations are massless , the rules of construction for string models change and one may need to take a fresh look at model building in string theory",
    "of course , the light mirror particles even if they exist need not necessarily fall into a full generation .",
    "thus while a full generation is the simplest possibility for the cancellation of anomalies , it may happen that such cancellations may involve some exotic mirrors .",
    "this would make model building even more challenging .",
    "many open question remain for further study the most important of which is a detailed dynamical model for the mixings of ordinary and mirror particles below the grand unification scale . in the analysis given in this work we assumed a phenomenological approach where we introduce mixings between the two sectors . however , a concrete mechanism is desirable to achieve a more complete understanding of the mixings of the ordinary matter and mirror matter .",

    "+ in the supersymmetric sector , the mass terms of the scalar leptons and scalar mirror leptons arise from the f - term , the d - term and the soft supersymmetry breaking terms in the scalar potential . for example , the mixing terms between @xmath324 and @xmath325 can arise from the @xmath326 term in the superpotenital and from the trilinear coupling term of the soft breaking potential @xmath327 .",
    "this gives us the terms @xmath328 .",

    "one can fix these mixings to be zero by a proper choice of the parameters @xmath326 , @xmath334 and @xmath335 .",
    "the other elements of the scalar mass@xmath74 matrix can also be easily worked out . as an example , the f - term produces a part of the mixing between @xmath325 and @xmath330 as follows v = f_i^ * f_i ,   f_i=. here @xmath336 is the scalar @xmath329 and = f_2 h_2 ^ 2 ^*_r+f_4 ^*_r - f_2h_2 ^ 1 ^*_r , which gives v_f=(f_2 h_2 ^ 2 * _ r+f_4 _ r - f_2h_2 ^ 1 * _ r)(f_2 h_2 ^ 2 ^*_r+f_4 ^*_r - f_2h_2 ^ 1 ^*_r ) . after breaking of the electroweak symmetry the @xmath337 part of the scalar potential given above produces the following mass terms -_m = f^2_2 _ r ^*_r + f_4 f_2 ^*_r _",
    "r + f_4 f_2 _",
    "r ^*_r + f^2_4 ^*_r _ r here one finds that the mixing between @xmath325 and @xmath330 occurs such that the corresponding elements in the mass@xmath74 matrix @xmath338 and @xmath339 are equal .    for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we assume a simple mixing scenario for mixings in the scalar sector .",
    "specifically we assume mixings among scalars and mirror scalars of the same chirality .",
    "thus for the charged leptons we assume mixings between @xmath340 and @xmath341 and similarly mixings between @xmath342 and @xmath343 , but no mixing between @xmath66 and between @xmath341 and @xmath343 .",
    "these are obviously approximations to the more general analysis given in sec.(2 ) . under the above approximations the diagnolizing matrices @xmath344 and @xmath345 would have the following simple structures ^=    (    cccc _ 1 & _ 1 & 0&0 -_1 & _ 1 & 0&00&0&_2 & _ 20&0&-_2 & _ 2    )    , and ^=    (    cccc _ 1 & _ 1 & 0&0 -_1 & _ 1 & 0&00&0&_2 & _ 20&0&-_2 & _ 2    )    .t in the charged leptonic sector , assuming the independent set of parameters to be @xmath346 , @xmath347 ,",
