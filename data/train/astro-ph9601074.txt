    "the best known model of an accretion flow is the standard thin accretion disk developed by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , novikov & thorne ( 1973 ) , and lynden - bell & pringle ( 1974 ) ( see frank , king & raine ( 1992 ) for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the basic assumption of the model is that the accreting gas is cool , compared to the local virial temperature , so that the flow acquires a thin disk configuration .",
    "the disk parameters are calculated assuming an equilibrium between the viscous energy generation inside the disk and radiative cooling from the surface ; the latter is computed under the assumption that the disk is optically thick in the vertical direction .    the thin disk model has been widely and successfully used for modeling various low energy systems such as accreting white dwarfs and pre - main - sequence stars ( frank et al .",
    "1992 ) . however , the model has had less success explaining the characteristics of relativistic objects such as accreting black holes .",
    "there are essentially two problems : 1 ) in a system containing an accreting black hole , the accretion disk must extend inwards to the schwarzschild radius , @xmath6 .",
    "however , for reasonable mass accretion rates and the standard @xmath3 viscosity prescription , the lightman - eardley instability ( lightman & eardley 1974 ) causes a breakdown of the thin disk configuration at radii @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , there is some doubt that a thin accretion disk can exist at all close to a black hole .",
    "2 ) even if a thin disk is viable , there is a problem with the spectrum .",
    "since the gas in a thin disk model is optically thick , we would expect a roughly blackbody - like spectrum at the high frequency end , with a cutoff at several kev . however , extensive observations of black hole systems by ginga , granat , and gro ( tanaka 1989 , grebenev et al .",

    "1994 , kinzer et al .",
    "1994 , gilfanov et al .",
    "1995 ) have made it clear that the spectra of most black hole accretors have a hard power - law components extending to few@xmath8100 kev .",
    "this component has to be radiated by an optically thin plasma with temperature @xmath9 k. the required temperature is at least an order of magnitude higher than that predicted by the standard thin disk model .",
    "shapiro , lightman , & eardley ( 1976 , hereafter sle ) discovered a new class of solutions at sub - eddington accretion rates , where the accretion flow is optically thin and quite hot ( @xmath10 k ) .",
    "these authors also introduced the important idea of a two - temperature plasma , in which ions are much hotter than electrons .",
    "since the sle solution has exactly the necessary characteristics ( optically thin hot gas ) to explain the spectra of accreting black holes , it has been widely studied and applied in models of x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei ( e.g. kusunose & takahara 1985 , 1989 ; white & lightman 1989 ; wandel & liang 1991 ; melia & misra 1993 ; luo & liang 1994 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the sle solution is thermally unstable ( pringle , rees , & pacholczyk 1973 , piran 1978 ) .",
    "the efficiency of bremsstrahlung cooling in the optically thin gas is proportional to the particle density which decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "therefore , as the gas is perturbed to a higher temperature , the rate of cooling per unit mass decreases and the gas heats up even further in a runaway process .",
    "the thermal instability of the sle solution makes it unlikely that real flows can take up this configuration .",
    "recently , a new class of two - temperature advection - dominated solutions has been discovered ( narayan & yi 1994 , 1995a , 1995b ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ; chen 1995 ; chen et al .",
    "these advection - dominated solutions are optically thin , are hotter even than the sle solution , and are viscously and thermally stable to large - wavelength perturbations ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 , narayan & yi 1995b ) .",
    "although kato , abramowicz & chen ( 1995 ) have discovered an instability in these flows at short wavelengths , they show that the mode amplitude does not grow significantly and so the viability of the solutions is not in doubt .",
    "the advection - dominated model has been fairly successful in explaining a number of low - luminosity systems ( e.g. a model for sagittarius a@xmath11 by narayan , yi , & mahadevan [ 1995 ] , a model for the soft x - ray transient a0620 - 00 by narayan , mcclintock & yi [ 1996 ] , and a model for the central source in ngc 4258 by lasota et al . [ 1996 ] ) and is perhaps also a reasonable model for more luminous systems ( narayan 1996 ; narayan , yi , & mahadevan 1996 ) .",
    "the most detailed advection - dominated models considered so far are based on a two - temperature plasma which cools via bremsstrahlung , synchrotron and comptonization processes .",
    "however , there have been discussions in the literature questioning whether a two temperature plasma can occur at all in astrophysical accretion flows ( phinney 1981 , rees et al .",
    "the discussion has been further fueled by the work of begelman & chiueh ( 1988 ) , who identified a particular mechanism involving collective plasma waves , which may under certain conditions pump energy directly into the electrons and bring the ions and electrons into thermal equilibrium .",
    "an important question therefore is the following : are there stable hot solutions , analogous to the two - temperature advection - dominated solution , if the plasma is well - coupled and has a single temperature for the ions and electrons ?",
    "abramowicz et al . ( 1995 ) and chen ( 1995 ) did consider single - temperature plasmas in their studies of advection - dominated flows , but they included only bremsstrahlung cooling .",
    "as yet , one - temperature models with a more detailed cooling , including synchrotron radiation and comptonization of synchrotron and bremsstrahlung photons , has not been considered , even though at @xmath12 k with an equipartition magnetic field these processes completely dominate over pure bremsstrahlung cooling .",
    "this is the study we present here .    in  2",
    "we derive the equations that describe an accreting one - temperature plasma .",
    "we then present the main results of the paper in  3 .",
    "we find that , as in the two - temperature case ( narayan & yi 1995b , hereafter ny ) , the equations allow three branches of solutions : the standard thin shakura & sunyaev disk , a hot optically - thin , thermally unstable solution , which is equivalent to the sle branch for a two - temperature plasma , and finally a new hotter and thermally stable disk solution .",
    "we describe the properties of the new solution and compare it to the corresponding two - temperature solution branch . among other things , we find that the one - temperature solution is hotter than the equivalent two - temperature one and is _ not _ advection - dominated for a wide range of accretion rates .",
    "this means that for a given @xmath4 the one - temperature disk is considerably more luminous .",
    "we conclude in  4 with a summary and discussion .",
    "narayan & yi ( 1994 , 1995b ) derived a set of local equations describing a vertically averaged , axisymmetric , two - temperature advection - dominated flow . here",
    "we slightly modify these equations by setting the electron and ion temperatures equal to each other .",
    "we also include radiation pressure , which ny neglected .",
    "the vertically averaged pressure @xmath13 and density @xmath14 of the accreting gas are given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the local isothermal sound speed , @xmath4 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath2 is the radius , @xmath17 is the vertical scale height of the disk , and @xmath18 is the radial velocity .",
    "we write the total pressure as the sum of the gas , radiation and magnetic pressures , @xmath19 , and we define three quantities that describe their relative magnitudes : @xmath20 determines the fraction of the total pressure due to gas pressure ; @xmath21 determines the importance of magnetic field pressure ; finally @xmath22 is defined such that @xmath23 so that @xmath22 represents the ratio of gas pressure to the sum of gas and radiation pressure , @xmath24 . for @xmath25",
    "radiation pressure is unimportant , and for @xmath26 radiation pressure dominates over gas pressure . in our calculations",
    "we fix the value of @xmath27 , typically at @xmath28 corresponding to magnetic pressure equal to @xmath29 of the total pressure , and then solve for @xmath22 and @xmath30 .    with the above definitions ,",
    "the scaled relations derived by ny take the form : @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the magnetic field strength and the quantity @xmath33 determines the degree to which the flow is advection - dominated .",
    "@xmath33 ranges from 0 to 1 ; the limit of @xmath34 corresponds to the extreme case when all the energy is stored in the gas and advected , while @xmath35 corresponds to a standard cooling - dominated disk where most of the generated energy is radiated locally .",
    "the quantity @xmath36 is the viscous dissipation of energy per unit volume , and the factors @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are given by @xmath39    in the above equations masses are scaled in units of the solar mass @xmath40 accretion rates in eddington units @xmath41 where @xmath42 and we assume the standard efficiency factor @xmath43 ( e.g. frank et al . 1992 ) ; and radii in schwarzschild units @xmath44    if we choose the values of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath3 and @xmath27 , and assume specific values for @xmath30 and @xmath48 , equations ( [ 2.1 ] ) , ( [ 2.2 ] ) and ( [ 2.3 ] ) yield all the other disk parameters .      some of the hot solutions we calculate in this paper have temperatures of up to @xmath49 k ( see figure [ rad.all][d ] ) , and",
    "it therefore becomes necessary to include in our model the effects of relativistic pair production and annihilation . since a complete solution of",
    "the pair balance problem is beyond the scope of our calculation , we make some simplifying assumptions .    svensson ( 1982 , 1984 ) has explored the properties of pair equilibria in a uniform relativistic plasma where photons are generated via pair annihilation and bremsstrahlung .",
    "he finds that for temperatures below a certain critical value @xmath50 there are two equilibrium branches available that are characterized by the ratio @xmath51 of the pair number density , @xmath52 , to the number density of protons , @xmath53 : ( 1 ) an optically thin low-@xmath51 branch ( @xmath54 ) where pair production is dominated by particle - particle processes , and ( 2 ) a high-@xmath51 branch ( @xmath55 ) where the thomson scattering optical depth is of order unity and photon - photon pair production dominates .",
    "we confine our calculations to the low-@xmath51 branch where only particle - particle processes are important .",
    "svensson has shown that the electron - electron pair production rate is always larger than the electron - proton rate by a factor of @xmath56 .",
    "this allows us to ignore the contribution from electron - proton collisions .    with the above simplifications",
    ", we can solve for the equilibrium pair density , @xmath51 , analytically at any given temperature .",
    "for a thermal distribution of electrons and positrons , the pair annihilation rate per unit volume is ( svensson 1982 ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the dimensionless electron temperature , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is given by : @xmath61^{-1}.\\ ] ] for the electron - electron pair production rate we adopt the expression used by white & lightman ( 1989 ) : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the fine structure constant .",
    "local equilibrium requires that @xmath64 , which allows us to solve for @xmath51 as a function of the plasma temperature .",
    "we find that for the highest temperature of interest , @xmath65 k , @xmath51 has a maximum value @xmath66 , and that it decreases monotonically in cooler plasmas .",
    "this implies that our low-@xmath51 assumption is consistent .",
    "given @xmath51 we can compute the total number density of electrons in the disk , @xmath67 , and number density of electrons plus positrons , @xmath68 .",
    "since ions are considerably more massive than electrons and positrons , viscous heating will affect primarily the ions ( sle , phinney 1981 , rees et al .",
    "1982 ) , which will then transfer this energy to the electrons . in their paper ny assume that the energy transfer occurs only via coulomb interactions , ignoring possible non - thermal coupling mechanisms ( e.g. begelman & chiueh 1988 ) . since coulomb interactions are not efficient at low densities , the ions are always hotter than the electrons . in this paper",
    "we assume that the ions and electrons have been brought into thermal equilibrium by some process , without explicitly specifying the actual coupling mechanism .",
    "the cooling of the hot plasma occurs mainly through the electrons and positrons . in our model",
    "we consider three cooling processes : bremsstrahlung , synchrotron , and compton cooling by both bremsstrahlung and synchrotron photons .",
    "[ [ bremsstrahlung - cooling ] ] bremsstrahlung cooling + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the free - free radiation in a plasma is produced through five different types of interactions : electron - electron ( @xmath69 ) , electron - ion ( @xmath70 ) , positron - electron ( @xmath71 ) , positron - positron ( @xmath72 ) , and positron - ion ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "however , @xmath70 and @xmath73 processes can be combined together since their corresponding cooling rates are identical , and the same is true for @xmath69 and @xmath74 processes .",
    "thus the total bremsstrahlung cooling rate per unit volume is just the sum of the rates for @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath71 processes ; and we can write @xmath77 , provided we replace @xmath78 by @xmath79 and @xmath80 by @xmath81 in our calculations of @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively .    following ny , we adopt the expressions from stepney & guilbert ( 1983 ) and svensson ( 1982 ) for the @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath84 bremsstrahlung cooling rates : @xmath85 where @xmath86    [ [ synchrotron - cooling ] ] synchrotron cooling + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    synchrotron cooling is very important in our model , both because we assume an equipartition magnetic field in the disk and because we consider relativistic temperatures for the electrons and positrons .",
    "pacholczyk ( 1970 ) has calculated the spectrum of synchrotron emission by a relativistic maxwellian distribution to be @xmath87 where @xmath88 @xmath89 is the angle between the velocity vector of the electrons and the direction of the local magnetic field , and @xmath90 is a tabulated function .",
    "positrons produce synchrotron radiation at the same rate as electrons do and therefore in equation ( [ 2.10 ] ) we have used the total number density , @xmath91 , instead of @xmath92 .    for an isotropic velocity distribution we can average @xmath93 over @xmath89 to get a new function @xmath94 for which a fitting function was found by mahadevan , narayan & yi ( 1996 ) : @xmath95 we substitute this function for @xmath93 in equation ( [ 2.10 ] )",
    ".    equations ( [ 2.10 ] ) and ( [ 2.11 ] ) are valid only for optically thin emission . however , below some critical frequency @xmath96 the emission becomes self - absorbed and that has to be taken into account in computing the total cooling rate .",
    "we estimate @xmath96 as the frequency at which the synchrotron emission from a thin annulus of height @xmath97 , radius @xmath2 , and thickness @xmath98 is equal to the blackbody emission ( in the rayleigh - jeans limit ) from the upper and lower surfaces of the annulus ( ny presented a similar argument but they used a spherical rather than cylindrical geometry ) .",
    "this condition gives us the equation : @xmath99 which we can solve numerically for given values of @xmath2 , @xmath17 , and @xmath48 to obtain @xmath96 .",
    "given the value of the critical frequency , we can estimate the total synchrotron emission per unit volume as follows .",
    "we assume that for frequencies below @xmath96 the emission is completely self - absorbed so that the volume emissivity can be approximated by the blackbody emission from the surface of the disk divided by the disk volume . above @xmath96",

    "it is an especially important process for higher values of the accretion rate , when the scattering depth is of order unity and synchrotron emission is the dominant photon production mechanism , i.e. most photons are initially very soft .",
    "we compute the compton cooling rate using the comptonized energy enhancement factor @xmath106 , which is defined as the average ratio of the energy of a photon at escape to its initial energy .",
    "we adopt the following prescription for @xmath106 , which is derived in appendix a : @xmath107 + \\eta_{max } p ( j_m+1 , s),\\ ] ] where @xmath108 \\int_0^x{t^{a-1 } e^{-t}\\ d t}$ ] is the incomplete gamma function and @xmath109 the parameter @xmath110 is the average increase in energy of a soft photon per scattering for a maxwellian distribution of electrons ( and positrons ) at temperature @xmath111 , @xmath112 is the thomson optical depth ( counting both electrons and positrons ) , @xmath113 is the number of scatterings required for the maximum possible energy enhancement @xmath114 , and @xmath115 is the initial photon frequency . by definition ,",
    "the comptonized flux is the original flux multiplied by @xmath106 .",
    "since the synchrotron spectrum is strongly peaked at the critical frequency @xmath96 , we estimate the cooling rate due to the comptonization of the synchrotron radiation simply by computing @xmath106 for @xmath116 : @xmath117    the spectrum of bremsstrahlung radiation is practically flat for frequencies between the bremsstrahlung self - absorption frequency , @xmath118 , and the exponential cutoff at @xmath119 .",
    "the emission at frequencies @xmath120 is negligible compared with the integrated bremsstrahlung cooling rate .",
    "therefore , we can approximate free - free emission per unit frequency as the ratio @xmath121 .",
    "we estimate @xmath118 as the frequency at which the free - free absorption opacity , @xmath122 ( which is frequency dependent ) is equal to the electron scattering opacity , @xmath123 . below @xmath118 comptonization",

    "an equilibrium thermal state for the accretion flow requires that viscous heating minus the advected energy is exactly balanced by the total radiative cooling at each radius : @xmath138 for fixed values of @xmath46 , @xmath45 , @xmath139 , and @xmath27 , the equations ( [ 2.1])-([3.1 ] ) comprise a closed set which can be solved to obtain all the relevant parameters of the accretion flow .",
    "we solve the equations numerically using @xmath48 and @xmath22 as free variables .",
    "we begin by assuming arbitrary values for @xmath48 and @xmath22 and use equations ( [ 2.2])-([2.6 ] ) to calculate all the parameters of the plasma , including the pair fraction .",

    "we then vary @xmath48 , optimizing @xmath22 at each step , until the energy equation ( [ 3.1 ] ) is satisfied . at this point",
    "we have a self - consistent equilibrium solution .",
    "all calculations presented below were done for an equipartition magnetic field strength in the disk , @xmath142 .",
    "however , we have found that models with @xmath143 ( where magnetic pressure constitutes only @xmath144 of the total pressure ) produce practically the same results .",

    "the three points where the two curves intersect , labeled as 1 , 2 , and 3 on the figure , correspond to three equilibrium states of the accretion disk where the energy balance equation ( [ 3.1 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the equilibrium point 1 corresponds to the standard shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) thin disk ; the middle point is the one - temperature equivalent of the unstable shapiro , lightman , & eardley ( 1976 ) solution ; the equilibrium point labeled 3 is a new hot solution which which does not seem to have been discussed before in the literature .",
    "it is related to the advection - dominated one - temperature solution of abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , but with some important differences as we argue later .",
    "note that the slope of the cooling curve in figure [ stab ] changes twice . at @xmath149",
    "k the change of slope indicates a transition from an optically thick to an optically thin flow .",
    "there is a corresponding kink in the heating curve , since at this point the cooling rate is at its maximum and radiation pressure briefly dominates over the gas pressure , causing a sharp decrease in gas density . for @xmath150",
    "k , the gas cools as a blackbody and the cooling rate increases with increasing temperature . for @xmath151",
    "k , the dominant cooling process is optically thin bremsstrahlung , which is less efficient at higher temperatures . at @xmath152",
    "k the slope of @xmath153 changes again , indicating a point where synchrotron radiation becomes the dominant cooling process .",
    "in contrast to bremsstrahlung , the synchrotron emission increases with increasing temperature , hence the positive slope of the cooling curve at these high temperatures .    by inspection",
    "it is obvious that equilibria 1 and 3 are thermally stable . in both of these equilibria ,",
    "if the gas is perturbed to a higher temperature , the rate of cooling becomes greater than the rate of heating , allowing the medium to cool back to the equilibrium value of @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath48 becomes slightly smaller , the heating rate exceeds the cooling rate and the gas heats up back to the equilibrium temperature .",
    "the equilibrium 2 on the other hand is unstable . here",
    "a small increase or decrease in @xmath48 leads to a runaway situation where @xmath48 deviates progressively more rapidly from the equilibrium value .",
    "we have computed the properties of the accreting gas corresponding to the three equilibria for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting curves for a central black hole of mass @xmath147 at fixed radial distance @xmath148 are plotted in figure [ mdot.alpha ] for @xmath154 ( heavy line ) and @xmath155 ( thin line ) .",

    "is indicated by a dashed line .",
    "for @xmath154 the topology of our results is qualitatively similar to that of the corresponding solutions for two - temperature disks described by chen et al .",
    "we see that the two hotter branches merge together at some critical accretion rate ( @xmath1 ) , above which the cooling in the disk is so efficient that the only equilibrium allowed is the standard thin disk solution . for @xmath156",
    "the hot branch extends to much higher values of the accretion rate ; in fact , the value of @xmath1 goes up by @xmath157 orders of magnitude , in agreement with the results of abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and ny .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the topology of the solution curves for @xmath158 continues to be similar to that for @xmath154 .",
    "this is different from the result reported by chen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who found that for @xmath156 the middle branch merged with the cold disk solution , whereas the hottest branch extended independently upward to become the optically - thick advection - dominated solution discovered by abramowicz et al .",
    "the value of the critical @xmath3 at which the topology changes is , however , sensitive to the details of the radiation processes included in the model ( m. abramowicz , private communication ) .",

    "figure [ mdot.2temp ] directly compares the two - temperature ( thin line ) and one - temperature ( heavy line ) equilibrium solutions for a disk with @xmath154 . for temperatures below @xmath162 k the two curves merge , since the electron and ion temperatures in the two - temperature solution are nearly equal ( figure [ mdot.2temp][c ] ) and therefore , two - temperature and one - temperature solutions are effectively the same",

    "this is a completely new result , as prior to this the only hot stable solutions known were all advection - dominated ( ny , abramowicz et al . 1995 , chen 1995 , chen et al . 1995 ) . since the cooling rate is given by @xmath166 , we see that , at a given accretion rate , our single - temperature disk with its low value of @xmath33 is considerably more luminous than the equivalent two - temperature flow .    in the case of the two - temperature advection - dominated hot solutions discussed by ny and abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the thermal stability of the solution to long - wavelength perturbations has been shown to be the direct result of advection .",
    "however , our hot one - temperature solution branch 3 is cooling - dominated and has very little advection .",
    "why is this solution stable ?",
    "the answer is obvious from figure [ stab ] , where we see that the introduction of synchrotron cooling causes the cooling curve @xmath167 to be steeply positive for @xmath168 k. therefore , thermal stability is achieved in this solution because of the usual reason , namely that the cooling increases more rapidly than the heating .",

    "1995 ) considered the pure bremsstrahlung one - temperature case and they obtained a hot advection - dominated solution .",
    "thus , the inclusion of synchrotron cooling has an important effect on the basic physics of the accretion flow .",
    "although a full linear stability analysis along the lines of kato et al .",
    "( 1995 ) has not been done on our new solutions , we suspect that these solutions are stable to all linear perturbations , regardless of wavelength .",
    "figure [ rad ] illustrates the radial structure of a disk with @xmath169 for a fixed value of the accretion rate , @xmath170 .",
    "the inner edge was chosen to be at @xmath171 , corresponding to the last stable orbit .",
    "as expected , we see that the two - temperature ( thin line ) and one - temperature ( heavy line ) solutions merge at large radii where the temperature is low and even the two - temperature plasma has effectively a single temperature ( see figure [ rad][c ] ) .",
    "thus , away from the center , the flow is advection - dominated ( see figure [ rad][b ] ) and almost spherical with @xmath172 ( figure [ rad][d ] ) , regardless of whether we have a two - temperature or one - temperature solution .",
    "however , closer to the accreting object , the flow becomes increasingly cooling - dominated in the one - temperature case and settles into a disk with @xmath173 at the inner edge . the resulting geometry ",
    "thinnish disk near the inner edge and quasi - spherical flow at larger radii  is unusual for accretion disk models .",
    "another interesting feature of our one - temperature solution is that the temperature profile of the disk is not monotonic but has a well defined maximum at @xmath174 .",
    "therefore , the hottest part of the spectrum does not come from the inner edge of the disk .",
    "ny showed that their advection - dominated hot two - temperature solution exists only for accretion rates @xmath164 less than a critical rate @xmath175 , which depends on @xmath3 and @xmath2 ( see also abramowicz et al .",
    "we find a similar result also in the case of our cooling - dominated hot one - temperature solution .",
    "figure [ mcrit ] shows the critical accretion rate @xmath175 for our solution as a function of @xmath2 as well as the variation of the gas temperature .",
    "the two panels on the left ( figure 5[a , b ] ) compare the results for the one - temperature and two - temperature solutions for @xmath154 .",
    "we see that the electron temperatures for the two solutions are nearly equal , but the behavior of @xmath1 is quite different in the two cases . for a two - temperature flow , @xmath1 is roughly independent of @xmath2 for @xmath176 and is given approximately by @xmath177 ( see ny and abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 for a discussion of the @xmath178 scaling ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath1 decreases almost linearly with decreasing @xmath2 in the one - temperature case , so that @xmath179 for @xmath180 thus , near the black hole , @xmath1 for the one - temperature solution is smaller than that of the two - temperature solution by as much as two orders of magnitude .    the steep decrease of @xmath175 with decreasing @xmath2 leads to an interesting effect which is already seen in figure [ rad ] . for a wide range of @xmath164 ,",
    "it is possible to have @xmath181 at large radii , but to have @xmath182 at small radii , with a transition at some critical radius @xmath183 . for the example shown in figure [ rad ]",
    ", we have @xmath184 . in this case",
    ", we can have a hot one - temperature solution for @xmath185 , but the solution disappears at @xmath186 . below @xmath183 , the only equilibrium solution available is the cool thin accretion disk .",
    "( note that , because of the very low @xmath187 , the lightman - eardley instability does not affect the thin disk solution in this case . )",
    "thus , the example shown in figure [ rad ] has an extremely unusual structure . for @xmath188 ,",
    "there is a standard thin disk .",
    "then , for @xmath189 , we have a hot , but cooling - dominated thickish disk .",
    "finally , for @xmath190 , we have a regular advection - dominated quasi - spherical flow .",
    "there are several discussions in the literature of models where an outer thin disk makes a transition to a hot inner flow ( e.g. sle , wandel & liang 1991 , narayan , mcclintock , & yi 1996 , narayan 1996 ) , but here we have an example of a model which does the opposite , namely transforms from an outer hot advection - dominated flow via a cooling - dominated hot flow to an inner thin disk .",
    "( see melia 1994 for the closest example discussed previously in the literature . )",
    "figure [ rad.all ] shows how the properties of the flow change as the accretion rate is reduced .",
    "there are some interesting effects .",
    "first , with decreasing @xmath164 , the critical radius @xmath183 disappears so that there is no longer any reason for the gas to make a transition to a cool disk on the inside .",
    "as @xmath4 decreases still farther , even the cooling - dominated zone of the hot disk disappears , and advection becomes more important throughout the flow . consequently the disk thickens considerably , and the maximum in the temperature profile at large radius becomes less apparent .",
    "for @xmath160 and @xmath191 the flow is advection - dominated and nearly virial at all radii .",
    "figure [ rad.all][c ] shows the relative importance of comptonized synchrotron cooling as a function of @xmath2 at various @xmath164 .",
    "we see that synchrotron and comptonized synchrotron cooling is dominant in the inner regions , @xmath192 , regardless of the accretion rate . in the outer disk , on the other hand , where the flow is cooler and more advection - dominated",
    ", the cooling is mostly due to bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "though one - temperature solutions are restricted to smaller values of @xmath164 than the corresponding two - temperature solutions , nevertheless we should note that for any given @xmath4 they are significantly more luminous .",
    "this is because these flows are cooling - dominated at small radii where most of the radiation is emitted .",
    "figure [ lumin](a ) illustrates this luminosity increase in the case of @xmath193 .",
    "here we plot the total disk luminosity as a function of @xmath4 for one - temperature ( solid line ) and two - temperature ( dashed line ) solutions .",
    "note that at @xmath194 the one - temperature disk is @xmath195 times more luminous than its two - temperature counterpart .",
    "figure [ lumin](b ) shows how the total luminosity of our one - temperature solutions changes with @xmath3 .",
    "for a given value of @xmath4 , higher-@xmath3 solutions are less luminous , since they are more advection - dominated ( see figure [ mdot.alpha][e ] )",
    ". however , higher values of @xmath3 allow the hot solution to survive up to higher accretion rates ( see figure [ mcrit][c ] ) with correspondingly higher luminosities .",
    "thus , the most luminous system that we can model as a hot one - temperature disk extending down to @xmath171 requires @xmath155 and @xmath196 , and has a total luminosity @xmath197 .",
    "we could in principle use higher values of @xmath4 , but then as discussed above , we will have to include a cool thin disk at small radii @xmath198 ) .",
    "most of the work done so far on modeling hot accretion disks has been based on two - temperature flows , where the electrons are much cooler than the ions ( sle ; rees et al .",
    "1982 ; melia & misra 1993 ; narayan & yi 1995b ; narayan et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "however , if there exist mechanisms of energy transfer between ions and electrons that are more efficient than coulomb scattering ( phinney 1981 , rees et al .",
    "1982 , begelman & chiueh 1988 ) , the plasma might be well - coupled and the ions and electrons may have the same temperature . in this paper",
    "we have investigated how the properties of the hot , stable two - temperature solution described by ny and chen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) are altered if ions and electrons in the accreting plasma are constrained to have the same temperature .",
    "we start from the set of equations developed by ny , adding radiation pressure and particle - particle pair production processes , and improving some of the radiative cooling calculations .",
    "we solve these equations for various choices of the viscosity parameter , @xmath3 , and magnetic pressure parameter , @xmath27 , explicitly setting the ion and electron temperatures equal to each other .",
    "the resulting three branches of solutions which we obtain ( figure [ stab ] ) correspond to the standard thin disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 , novikov & thorne 1973 , lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ) , the one - temperature equivalent of the unstable hot solution discovered by sle , and finally a new thermally stable hot solution whose properties we discuss in detail (  3 ) .",
    "the new solution , which is identified by label 3 in figures 1 and 2 , is the one - temperature equivalent of the two - temperature advection - dominated solutions discussed by ny ( see also abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 , chen et al .",
    "1995 ) .    for a viscosity parameter @xmath160 , we find that the topological relationships among the three solution branches are similar to those found by chen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and ny for the two - temperature solutions .",
    "specifically , we see that the two hot branches merge at some maximum value of the mass accretion rate , which we call @xmath1 , such that for @xmath199 the only solution available to the flow is the standard thin shakura & sunyaev disk configuration . at higher @xmath3",
    ", we confirm the result of chen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) that the topology changes",
    ". however , the critical @xmath3 where the change occurs is 1.7 ( at @xmath148 ) for the one - temperature case we consider , rather then 0.3 in chen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "we have computed the value of the critical mass accretion rate @xmath1 as a function of radius for different values of @xmath3 ( figure [ mcrit][c ] ) and @xmath27 .",
    "we find that @xmath1 varies roughly as @xmath178 ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 , ny ) and is relatively independent of @xmath27 .",
    "a new result is that @xmath1 varies almost linearly with @xmath2 for @xmath200 , since in a two - temperature flow @xmath1 is roughly independent of @xmath2 in that region .",
    "the maximum value of the accretion rate at which the hot solution exists near the inner disk radius ( @xmath171 ) is @xmath201 . in comparison",
    ", two - temperature hot solutions have @xmath202 .",
    "though our single - temperature solutions are limited to lower mass accretion rates than those allowed by two - temperature models , this is compensated to some degree by strong cooling in the inner regions , where @xmath165 for @xmath203 ( figure [ mcrit][f ] ) . as a result , over the range of mass accretion rates , @xmath204 ,",
    "our solutions are significantly more luminous than the corresponding two - temperature solutions ( figure 7[b ] ) .",
    "this work represents the first example of a hot thermally stable accretion solution which is also cooling - dominated and therefore an efficient radiator .",
    "because advection plays a very minor role in our new solutions , the thermal stability is not the result of advection as in the equivalent two - temperature solutions ( ny , abramowicz et al . 1995 ) or in the pure bremsstrahlung one - temperature solutions ( abramowicz et al . 1995 ) .",
    "we show that the thermal stability of the hot one - temperature solution is primarily the result of including synchrotron emission , which leads to a rapid increase of the cooling rate with increasing temperature ( see figure [ stab ] ) .",
    "an interesting feature of our models is the unusual geometry of the flow . since @xmath1 decreases with decreasing @xmath2 in the inner parts of the disk ( see figure [ mcrit ] ) , for a wide range of @xmath4 the disk has a very unusual structure . in the inner regions , where @xmath205 , the only possible solution for the accreting gas is the shakura & sunyaev thin disk .",
    "note that since we are restricted to relatively low mass accretion rates , the thin disk is viscously stable even at @xmath206 .",
    "further out , the hot solution exists , but it is cooling - dominated and therefore has a disk - like geometry . finally , in the outer parts of the disk the flow is fully advection - dominated and becomes nearly quasi - spherical .",
    "this interesting result , however , presents a problem for our calculations .",
    "the inner radiative zone of the disk is cooler than the outer advection - dominated zone , so the relatively soft photons emitted on the inside will compton cool the hot outer gas in a way that is incompatible with the local treatment of the radiative processes which we have used in this paper .",
    "the effects of the non - local radiation field need to be incorporated self - consistently into future calculations .",
    "since the gas temperatures in our solutions are on the order of @xmath207 k , pair production and annihilation processes must be taken into account . in our calculations",
    "we have included particle - particle pair production rates ( white & lightman 1989 ) which give values for the pair fraction @xmath51 less than a few percent , but we neglected photon - photon and photon - particle processes .",
    "we believe that this treatment is justified for low values of @xmath139 ( low optical depth ) , since bremsstrahlung radiation and comptonization become unimportant and the cooling is dominated by soft synchrotron photons which are incapable of producing pairs .",
    "however , for @xmath208 , comptonization of synchrotron radiation begins to dominate and photon processes may become important . to place a limit on these processes we computed the equilibrium pair density taking into account photon - photon and photon - particle pair production in the wien peak of the comptonized spectrum , using the rates derived by svensson ( 1984 ) .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath51 are significantly higher than the values computed taking into account only particle - particle pair production , as @xmath4 approaches @xmath1 .",
    "however , even at @xmath209 , the maximum value of @xmath51 that we find with the inclusion of photon interactions is only @xmath210 .",
    "kusunose ( 1996 ) and abramowicz ( 1996 ) confirm that pair processes are unimportant in the hot optically thin flows which they have studied .",
