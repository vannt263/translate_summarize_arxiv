    "[ disc ] we discuss the observational results in the framework of synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) models .",
    "the x - ray analysis described in the following is based on the 3 - 20  kev data from the proportional counter array ( pca ; jahoda et al .",

    "we did not use the 15250 kev data from the high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( rothschild et al .",
    "1998 ) due to poor signal to noise ratio .",
    "standard-2 mode pca data gathered with the top layer of the operational pcus ( proportional counter units ) were analyzed .",
    "the number of pcus operational during a pointing varied between 2 and 5 . after applying the standard screening criteria , the net exposure in each good time interval ranged from 16 secs to 3.15 ksecs ( see table  [ xflux ] ) .",
    "spectra and lightcurves were extracted with ` ftoolsv`5.0 .",
    "background models were generated with the tool ` pcabackest ` , based on the _ rxte _ gof calibration files for a `` faint''source ( less than 40 counts / sec / pcu ) .",
    "response matrices for the pca data were created with the script ` pcarsp`v.2.43 .",
    "the spectral analysis was performed with the ` xspec`v.11.0.1 package .",
    "a constant neutral hydrogen column density of 2  @xmath26 was chosen , a value which lies close to the 21 cm line hi result of 1.6  @xmath26 @xcite and the bepposax spectral absorption result of between @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "since the analysis is restricted to the energy region above 3  kev the chosen hydrogen column density has only a very minor influence on the estimated model parameters .",

    "( 1999a , b ) .",
    "the analysis uses the standard `` loose '' @xmath31/hadron separation cuts which minimize systematic errors on flux and spectral estimates rather than yielding the optimal signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "a software requirement of two triggered cherenkov telescopes within 200  m from the shower axis , each with more than 40 photoelectrons per image and a `` distance '' parameter of smaller than 1.7@xmath30 was used .",
    "additionally , only events with a minimum stereo angle larger than 20@xmath30 were admitted to the analysis .",
    "integral fluxes for certain energy intervals were obtained by integrating the differential energy spectra over the relevant energy region . by this means , the zenith angle dependence of the effective area has been corrected for and the results are largely independent of the assumed energy spectrum . for data runs during which the weather or the detector performance caused a cosmic ray detection rate deviating only slightly , i.e.  less than 15% from the expectation value , the @xmath31-ray detection rates and spectra were corrected accordingly .",

    "since the uncertainties in absolute fluxes are rather large , i.e.  30% , due to the 15% uncertainty in absolute energy scale , we will quote not only absolute flux values but also the flux strength compared to that from the crab nebula .",

    "note that the hegra observations had a mean duration of 1.8  h , considerably longer than the mean duration of 18  min of the _ rxte _ observations .",
    "furthermore , not all hegra and _ rxte _ observations had an overlap in time .",
    "as discussed in the next subsection the tev gamma - ray fluxes substantially vary on time scales as short as a fraction of an hour . a more detailed tev gamma - ray / x - ray flux correlation analysis is hampered by the large statistical errors of the tev flux estimates for adequately short integration times .",

    "[ lc1 ] and [ lc2 ] . here ,",
    "the hegra flux estimates have been computed with time bins of 15 min duration and only bins are shown which overlap with _ rxte _ observations . using 15  min time bins , the statistical errors on the tev flux estimates are comparable to the amplitude of the flux variability .    the lower panels in figs .",

    "the ( 2 - 5 tev)/(1 - 2 tev ) hardness ratios are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "the hardness ratios have been computed with the 1 - 2 tev and 2 - 5 tev photon fluxes after correction for the ( modest ) zenith angle dependent variation of the effective area over the considered energy range @xcite . for a tev energy spectrum of photon index",

    "the hardness ratios do not show evidence for spectral variability during the flare .",
    "a fit of a constant with a mean value of 0.23 gives a @xmath37 value of 11.7 for 8 degrees of freedom corresponding to a probability of 16.5% for a higher value by chance .",
    "the data following mjd 51582.225 has been taken under zenith angles larger than 30@xmath30 , where systematic errors start to be non - negligible .",
    "for these points ( which do not enter strongly the @xmath37-value cited above ) the 1 - 2 tev flux is uncertain by about 50% ; accordingly , the latest hardness ratio point has a systematic error comparable to the statistical one .",
    "unfortunately , _ rxte _",
    "observations were only performed during the first 1.5 hrs of the 4.8  hrs of hegra observations ( see fig .  [ inv ] , upper panel ) and did not cover the time of the strong tev gamma - ray flare .",

    "the time averaged spectrum of the february observations ( mjd 51576  mjd 51589 ) is well described by a pure power law model : @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath55 with @xmath4 @xmath56 photons @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "the fit has a @xmath37-value of 15.6 for 7 degrees of freedom ( chance probability 5% ) . in table",

    "the large @xmath37-value of the spectrum of mjd 51582.0603 stems from two underpopulated bins centered at energies of 700  gev and 4.35  tev and indicates spectral softening with increasing energy .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the curvature of the tev energy spectra which takes fully into account the systematic uncertainties is outside the scope of this paper and will be given in an upcoming paper in which the full year 2000 data set is included .",
    "as shown in table  [ xflux ] , a pure power law fit does not give an acceptable fit to the data ( chance probability well below 1% ) for 5 _ rxte _ observations with good photon statistics .",
    "we find that broken power law models describe the data of these 5 pointings satisfactorily and the results of fits to the 3 - 25  kev data are given in table [ bknpwl ] .",
    "the estimated break energies lie in the range between 6.6  kev and 8  kev and the difference between the low and the high energy power law photon indices are about 0.2 . due to the limited energy coverage of our x - ray observations we did not fit the data with more complex models incorporating continuous spectral curvature .",
    "we investigated if the other _ rxte _ data sets are consistent with a similar change in spectral index by fitting these data sets with a broken powerlaw model with a fixed break energy at 7.3  kev ( the mean break energy found for the data sets of table [ bknpwl ] ) .",
    "indeed , all fits suggest spectral steepening and we find a median value of the change in spectral index of 0.16 , very similar to the mean change in spectral index of 0.19 found for the data sets of table [ bknpwl ] .",
    "during our observation campaign , the x - ray photon index varied from values between 2.2 to 2.9 .",
    "cooling of a power law distribution of electrons changes the synchrotron spectral index by at most 0.5 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observations clearly show that either the spectral index of accelerated particles is variable , or that we observe the cooling of electrons near the high energy cut - off of the particle acceleration process .",
    "the tev gamma - ray / x - ray emission of mrk  421 is commonly attributed to the ssc mechanism ( see for alternative models aharonian et al .",
    "2000 , and references therein ) in which a population of high energy electrons emits synchrotron radiation at longer wavelengths and high energy photons from inverse compton ( ic ) processes of high energy electrons with lower energy synchrotron photons at shorter wavelengths .",
    "our initial modeling of the x - ray / tev gamma - ray data with the time dependent ssc code described by coppi ( 1992 ) allows already some interesting conclusions which we will detail in the following .",

    "did not reduce the ic photon yield substantially . reducing the jet doppler factor by using a minimum lorentz factor of accelerated particles",
    "requires @xmath104-values of several times @xmath111 which is difficult to motivate theoretically . taking into account extragalactic",
    "extinction would result in even higher doppler factors since the effect is expected to steepen the observed tev gamma - ray spectrum while reducing the gamma - ray flux around 1  tev by a factor @xmath1122 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , external seed photons , neglected in our analysis , would result in an even higher model prediction of the emitted tev gamma - ray flux .",
    "our modeling differs from earlier work which indicated doppler factors of about 15 ( see e.g.  inoue & takahara 1996 , mastichiadis & kirk 1997 , takahashi et al .",
    "2000 ) by one or several of the following reasons : we use a small emission volume ( consistent with flux variability on 30  min time scale ) , a minimum lorentz factor of accelerated electrons well below @xmath111 , and snapshots of an evolving electron spectrum instead of steady state electron spectra . since the cooling times of the electrons responsible for the x - ray and tev gamma - ray emission are comparable to the duration of individual flares , steady state electron populations overestimate the extend to which electron spectra cool before , during , and after individual flares .",
    "note that ssc models with doppler factors of about 15 predict , in agreement with the results of our code , tev energy spectra which are softer than the ones which have been observed so far ( inoue & takahara ( 1996 ) , takahashi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ) .    for high doppler factors , the energy density of relativistic electrons and that of the magnetic field are more comparable than for low doppler factors ( compare inoue & takahara 1996 ) : for our choice of @xmath104 and @xmath60 the energy density of relativistic particles is @xmath1130.01  erg @xmath114 and that of the magnetic field is @xmath1150.002  erg @xmath114 .",

    "this finding could naturally be explained in the framework of an inhomogeneous ssc model .",
    "if the region of particle acceleration is relatively small , an event of enhanced particle acceleration could result in a rapidly variable tev gamma - ray component originating from the vicinity of the acceleration region while the observed x - rays , dominated by the emission of particles of earlier acceleration events , could vary more slowly .",
    "if strong internal shocks accelerate the electrons , one indeed expects that the accelerated particles are bound to the downstream medium by the same scattering processes which enable particle acceleration .",
    "if the density of relativistic particles decreases downstream ( due to particle diffusion or due to adiabatic expansion of the downstream plasma ) the ssc mechanism then guarantees that the ic emissivity decreases faster than the synchrotron emissivity .",
    "although the synchrotron emission of such a system has been discussed in the literature ( see e.g.  heavens & meisenheimer ( 1987 ) , kirk et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ) , the consequences for the temporal evolution and correlation of the synchrotron and the ic components have not yet been studied .",

    "<S> in this paper we present the results of simultaneous observations of the tev blazar markarian  421 ( mrk  421 ) at x - ray and tev gamma - ray energies with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) and the stereoscopic cherenkov telescope system of the hegra ( high energy gamma ray astronomy ) experiment , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the source was monitored from february 2nd to february 16th and from may 3rd to may 8th , 2000 . in both energy bands several flares with very rapid flux variability were observed . in the x - ray band , </S>",
    "<S> the flux increased and decreased with e - folding times as short as about 5  hrs . </S>",
    "<S> the 3 - 20  kev photon index varied between values of 2.2 and 2.9 . for 5 pointings the data shows statistically significant evidence for spectral curvature . </S>",
    "<S> the photon index varied substantially on very short time scales : on february 11th it hardened within 1.6 hrs by @xmath0  0.18 and on february 14th it softened within 1.6 hrs by @xmath0  0.2 . </S>",
    "<S> the tev observations of february 7th/8th showed statistically significant evidence for substantial tev flux variability on 30  min time scale . </S>",
    "<S> the tev energy spectrum averaged over all the observations of the campaign shows a similar steep slope as in earlier hegra observations : @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 with @xmath4 @xmath5 photons @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath10 . within statistical errors no evidence for a curvature of the tev energy spectrum is found . </S>",
    "<S> we show the results of modeling the data with a time dependent homogeneous synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray and tev gamma - ray emission strengths and energy spectra together with the rapid flux variability strongly suggest that the emission volume is approaching the observer with a doppler factor of 50 or higher . </S>",
    "<S> the different flux variability time scales observed at x - rays and tev gamma - rays indicate that a more detailed analysis will require inhomogeneous models with several emission zones . </S>"
