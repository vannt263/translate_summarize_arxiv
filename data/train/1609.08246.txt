    "the possibility of manipulating the magnetization of a material by using an electric field is probably the most attractive envisioned application of magnetoelectric multiferroics ",
    "ferroelectrics with magnetic ordering.@xcite even if the mechanisms responsible for ferroelectricity and magnetism are somewhat exclusive of each other,@xcite in the last decade a large research effort has gone into searching for these materials.@xcite this effort has mainly focused on two groups of complex oxides : those where different species are responsible for the polarization and the magnetism , and those where the magnetic ordering breaks the inversion simmetry of the structure to create a small polarization .",
    "bifeo@xmath2 belongs to the first group and it is by far the most studied multiferroic,@xcite mainly because it keeps both its ferroic orderings well above room temperature ; it is also relatively easy to prepare in bulk and film form , and it has a simple crystal structure  a perovskite where inversion symmetry is broken to accommodate the lone pair of bi in the @xmath7 site , while the @xmath8 site harbors the fe ions whose @xmath9 electrons are responsible for magnetism .",
    "however , the ferromagnetic component in bifeo@xmath2 is tiny ; instead , the spins of two neighboring fe ions are almost perfectly antiparallel . in the difficult search for single - phase ferroelectric ferromagnets that would allow for a direct hysteresis loop of magnetization with electric field",
    "some candidate materials have been proposed .",
    "examples include eutio@xmath2 ( although ferromagnetism only settles at around 4 k@xcite ) , lufe@xmath0o@xmath10 ( although whether this is a ferroelectric is still under debate@xcite ) , fe@xmath2o@xmath10 ( although the exact structure that arises below the verwey transitions is not yet understood@xcite ) , cocr@xmath0o@xmath10 ( although both the magnetization and the polarization are very small@xcite ) , and , more recently , the metastable @xmath11-fe@xmath0o@xmath12@xcite    researchers have also explored perovskite oxides similar to bifeo@xmath2 , but with other transition - metal ions instead of fe .",
    "bimno@xmath2 is the only member of this group that displays strong ferromagnetism .",
    "initial reports attributed a polar @xmath13 space group to bulk bimno@xmath2,@xcite but more recent studies agree in that this is a paraelectric with @xmath3 symmetry.@xcite it is possible to change the structure of this material by growing it as a epitaxial thin film , although the calculations of spaldin and hatt@xcite showed that when the substrate - imposed distortion is small enough to keep the ferromagnetism in bimno@xmath2 , then a polarization does not develop , and our calculations@xcite showed that when the distortion is large enough to create a large polarization , then ferromagnetism turns into antiferromagnetism .",
    "another way to try to modify the properties of these oxides is to add a second species in one of the sites of the perovskite .",
    "azuma and coworkers reasoned that the goodenough - kanamori rules@xcite predict a ferromagnet if mn and ni shared the sites inside o@xmath1 octahedra in a rock - salt pattern ; when they prepared bi@xmath0nimno@xmath1 by high - pressure synthesis , they indeed measured large parallel magnetic moments,@xcite which persisted up to a curie temperature of 140 k. after their synchrotron x - ray powder diffraction , they concluded that the material shows a heavily distorted double perovskite structure where the ni@xmath14 and mn@xmath15 ions are indeed ordered in a rock - salt configuration ; they assigned the space group @xmath13 to this crystal . later , first - principles calculations characterized further this structure and quoted a value of the polarization around 20 @xmath16c/@xmath17.@xcite    unlike those previous studies , our first - principles calculations show that bulk bi@xmath0nimno@xmath1 is actually a paraelectric material with @xmath3 space group , the same situation as with bimno@xmath2 .",
    "however , we predict that when bi@xmath0nimno@xmath1 films are grown under achievable tensile epitaxial strain , it will indeed become a ferroelectric ferromagnet with a large polarization ( 70 @xmath16c/@xmath17 ) and a magnetization above 2  @xmath18 per transition metal cation , as in the bulk compound.@xcite we describe the methodology we have used for our calculations in section ii , present our results for the bulk material in section iii.a and for epitaxial films in section iii.b , and summarize the implications of our work in section iv .",
    "our first - principles calculations are based on density - functional theory ( dft).@xcite following our previous study of bimno@xmath2,@xcite we used two methods to treat the localized @xmath9 orbitals of ni@xmath14 and mn@xmath15 : ( i ) dft with a `` hubbard @xmath19'',@xcite using @xmath20  ev , @xmath21  ev , @xmath22  ev , and @xmath23  ev ; and ( ii ) dft with the hse06 hybrid functional.@xcite for all our calculations we have used the vasp@xcite code ; for this system , the second method demands two orders of magnitude more computer time than the first , but it predicts band gaps for solids that are much closer to experimental results,@xcite and in particular it performs well for perovskite oxides such as bifeo@xmath2.@xcite    we used the perdew - burke - ernzerhof dft exchange - correlation functional adapted to solids ( pbesol).@xcite to treat the ionic cores we resorted to the projector augmented - wave method,@xcite solving for the following electrons : ni s and mn s @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ; bi s @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ; and o s @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "we performed integrations in the brillouin zone using @xmath32-point grids with densities similar to that of the @xmath33 mesh for a 5-atom perovskite unit cell .",
    "our first set of calculations involves the optimization of bi@xmath0nimno@xmath1 bulk structures that might be competitive in energy with the ground state . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", previous experimental and computational studies consider that this ground state belongs to the @xmath13 space group ; refs .   and report the lattice parameters and wickoff positions of the atoms in the crystal unit cell , and we have run optimizations starting from those configurations . in the future",
    "we call this structure gs  the structure that the bulk material displays at low temperature and low pressure .",
    "another relevant phase is the one observed at high temperature with space group @xmath34 , fully described in ref .  ;",
    "this phase is analogous to the @xmath35 phase that appears in many bi@xmath36o@xmath2 perovskites at high pressure and/or high temperature,@xcite but with reduced symmetry because of the superimposed rock - salt pattern of ni@xmath37 and mn@xmath38 cations . by analogy with our previous paper about bimno@xmath2,@xcite",
    "we call this paraelectric phase @xmath39 . based on our previous experience in the search of new phases of bifeo@xmath2,@xcite bicoo@xmath2,@xcite and bimno@xmath2,@xcite we also relaxed ferroelectric phases similar to the rhombohedral ground state of bifeo@xmath2 ( so - called @xmath40 phases ) and to the supertetragonal ground state of bicoo@xmath2 ( so - called @xmath41 phases )",

    "( ii ) our pbssol+@xmath19 and hse06 methods give different predictions regarding which phase is the ground state of bulk bi@xmath0nimno@xmath1 ; ( iii ) there is a ferromagnetic @xmath40 phase with large polarization that is competitive with the phases known so far to exist , and ( iv ) no @xmath41 phase is obtained as a result of our optimizations . in the following ,",
    "we provide more details about each of these points .",
    "the original assignment of space group @xmath13 to the gs phase@xcite was done after obtaining synchrotron x - ray powder diffraction peaks that could be indexed as a monoclinic unit cell with the lattice parameters quoted in table  [ tab_bulk ] .",
    "because the unit cell was similar to that of bimno@xmath2 , a rietveld refinement was performed by assuming an initial model related to that bimno@xmath2 structure , and the validity of this model seemed satisfactory . at the time",
    ", the space group bimno@xmath2 was being described as @xmath13 , but later it was shown@xcite that it is @xmath3 . while @xmath3 is centrosymmetric , the @xmath13 space group allows for a polarization along the monoclinic axis ; calculations assuming a point - charge model or using the berry - phase first - principles theory gave a value of around 20 @xmath16c/@xmath17.@xcite as far as we know , no experimental measurement of the polarization has been done for bulk bi@xmath0nimno@xmath1 .",
    "our attempts to find a metastable @xmath13 phase for bi@xmath0nimno@xmath1 failed .",
    "every structure we have set with that space group lowered its energy when their atoms were allowed to move , ending always in the @xmath3 structure displayed in fig .  [ fig_structures](a ) .",
    "this also happens for bimno@xmath2 : different @xmath13 structures converge to the same lower - energy @xmath3 structure.@xcite we must however mention that previous first - principles calculations@xcite did report that a @xmath13 phase was found after optimization ( albeit with quite different wickoff positions than the experimental work ) .",
    "we have tried to reproduce those calculations using a methodology similar to that of ref .  , but",
    "by allowing enough relaxation steps the optimized structure slowly converged to the @xmath3 one presented here .",
    "other first - principles studies of bi@xmath0mnnio@xmath1 were done either fixing the structure to the experimental one@xcite or to the relaxed first - principles one of ciucivara and coworkers.@xcite further support for the @xmath3 space group is that the reported @xmath13 structure contains two different environments for the ni@xmath14 ions and one for the mn@xmath38 ions , but there is no explanation so far for this  there are no signs of charge or orbital ordering , for example .    to add to the puzzle of the possible paraelectricity of bulk bi@xmath0nimno@xmath1 ,",
    "a sizable polarization has indeed been measured in bi@xmath0nimno@xmath1 _ films_. the group that synthesized this double perovskite for the first time in bulk also grew it as a film on srtio@xmath2 using pulsed laser deposition.@xcite they measured a polarization of 5 @xmath16c/@xmath17 and a magnetic curie temperature of 100 k. their films displayed a pseudotetragonal structure with @xmath42    ( matching the substrate ) and @xmath43   , described as rather different from the bulk one , while keeping the same rock - salt pattern.@xcite using a chemical solution deposition method , lai _",
    "et al._@xcite grew bi@xmath0nimno@xmath1 films with and without srtio@xmath2 buffer layers on a pt@xmath44/ti / sio@xmath0/si@xmath45 substrate , obtaining polarizations around 6 and 8 @xmath16c/@xmath17 .",
    "again , the situation can be compared to that of bimno@xmath2 , where polarizations between 9 and 23 @xmath16c/@xmath17 have been reported for films,@xcite even if the bulk is nonpolar .",
    "for bimno@xmath2 we proposed that those measurements might be related to the formation of film phases under strain that are polar.@xcite    we move on now to the issue of the predicted ground state by different methodologies .",
    "table  [ tab_bulk ] shows that the three local minima of the energy surface of bi@xmath0nimno@xmath1 lie within only 30 mev per formula unit ( five - atom group of the standard perovskite unit cell ; in our case , bini@xmath46mn@xmath46o@xmath2 ) .",
    "our dft+@xmath19 method predicts a higher energy for the gs phase than for the other two ; this happened too for bimno@xmath2,@xcite where the situation is corrected by the hse06 hybrid .",
    "we have shown in the past that different exchange - correlation functionals predict almost the same minima of the energy surface of bimno@xmath2@xcite and bifeo@xmath2,@xcite although how those minima are ordered in energy can vary from functional to functional .",
    "as for bimno@xmath2 , here we use the fast dft+@xmath19 method when we are interested in finding possible energy minima , or when we are interested in energy differences between very similar structures , while we will resort to the more accurate and slow hse06 when it is important to evaluate energy differences between different phases .",
    "both dft+@xmath19 and hse06 predict that there exists a metastable ferromagnetic rhombohedral structure with a polarization around 70  @xmath16c/@xmath17 when computed using the berry - phase formalism ( we have checked that typical antiferromagnetic alignments are higher in energy ; details are given later for similar films ) .",
    "this is a structure like that of bulk bifeo@xmath2 , but where the superimposed rock - salt pattern of mn@xmath15 and ni@xmath14 causes a reduction from the @xmath47 space group to the @xmath48 symmetry ; it is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig_structures](c ) .",
    "according to first principles calculations , a similar structure is also metastable for bicoo@xmath2@xcite and bimno@xmath12@xcite    regarding the electronic structure , the gs , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 phases display similar density of states profiles , as shown in fig .",

    "we relaxed variations of the @xmath41 configurations of those other materials with the added rock - salt pattern of mn@xmath15 and ni@xmath14 , but the resulting structure was always one of the other three local minima .",
    "one possible way to stabilize a metastable phase of the bulk of a material is to grow it as a thin film on a substrate ; in this way , the epitaxial misfit strain acts as a handle to vary the relative energies of the possible bulk phases .",
    "we have simulated coherent epitaxial ( 001 ) films of bi@xmath0nimno@xmath2 by doing calculations of the bulk material where we impose mechanical boundary conditions determined by the lattice constant of the substrate , assumed to display in - plane square symmetry ( this is indeed the case for many perovskite substrates cut perpendicularly to one of the principal axes ) .    as a starting point , we adapted the three bulk phases described in the previous section to the in - plane square symmetry .",
    "there are two inequivalent ways to do this for the gs and @xmath39 phases , and one way for the @xmath40 phase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_structures ] .",
    "this causes small distortions to bring the in - plane lattice vectors to form a @xmath49 angle and to be of the same magnitude ( in the adapted @xmath39 and @xmath40 phases ) or of a ratio of magnitudes equal to two ( in the gs phase ) . in all cases ,",
    "those distortions cost only a few mev per formula unit .",
    "then , we do calculations in which we expand or contract the lattice vectors to mimic the effect of squared substrates with different lattice constants . we do this in intervals of 0.05   , and we use the wickoff positions and out - of - plane lattice vector of the previous geometry as a starting point of the next geometry relaxation . in this way , we arrive at a graphic of the energy of the films as a function of in - plane lattice constant that we show in fig .",
