    "for particles with sufficiently high energies the transition layer between the jet and the ambient medium can be approximated as a surface of discontinuous velocity change , a tangential discontinuity ( ` td ' ) . if particles gyroradia ( or mean free paths normal to the jet boundary ) are comparable to the actual thickness of this shear - layer interface it becomes an efficient cosmic ray acceleration site provided the considered velocity difference , @xmath0 , is relativistic and the sufficient amount of turbulence is present in the medium .",
    "the problem was extensively discussed in early eighties by berezhko with collaborators ( see the review by berezhko 1990 ) and in the diffusive limit by earl et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and jokipii et al .",
    "the case of a relativistic jet velocity was considered by ostrowski ( 1990 , 1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "the simulations ( ostrowski 1990 , cf . bednarz & ostrowski 1996 for shock acceleration ) show that in favorable conditions the acceleration process acting at relativistic tangential discontinuity of the velocity field can be very rapid , with the time scale    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is a particle gyroradius in the ambient medium and  for efficient particle scattering  the numerical factor @xmath3 can be as small as @xmath4 .",
    "the introduced acceleration time is coupled to the ` acceleration length ' @xmath5 due to particle advection in the jet flow . in the case of a non - relativistic jet or a small velocity gradient in the boundary shear layer the acceleration process is of the second - order in velocity and a rather slow one .",
    "then , the ordinary second - order fermi process in the turbulent medium can play a significant , or even a dominant role in the acceleration .",
    "the acceleration time scales can be evaluated only approximately for these processes , and - for particles residing within the considered layer - we can give an acceleration time scale estimate    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is a turbulence velocity ( @xmath8 the alfvn velocity for subsonic turbulence ) , @xmath9 is a mean particle free path normal to the jet axis and @xmath10 is a shear layer thickness .",
    "the first term in the denominator represents the second - order fermi process , while the second term is for the viscous cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "one expects that the first term dominates at low particle energies , while the second at larger energies , with @xmath11 approaching the value given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) for @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "conditions within the large scale jets of frii radio sources allow for acceleration of cosmic ray protons up to energies @xmath14 ev ( e.g. rachen & biermann 1993 , ostrowski 1998 ) . a characteristic feature of the boundary acceleration process in a simple considered model is formation of very flat spectrum of _ escaping particles_. it is due to the on average parallel magnetic field configuration within the shear layer , limiting the low cosmic rays escape .",
    "such particles residing within the shear layer volume can more efficiently stream to higher energies due to acting the acceleration process than to escape diffusively off the jet . at some higher energies escape",
    "becomes substantial , leading to the spectrum cut - off formation . in the considered conditions radiative losses are insignificant for protons .",
    "acting of the above mentioned processes can have pronounced consequences for the jet propagation if the seed particle injection at ` low energies ' is efficient .",
    "accelerated particles provide a viscous agent slowing down the jet movement .",
    "because the jet energy is transmitted mostly to high energy nuclei , this dissipative process can occur without significant radiative effects .",
    "if a jet appearing from the central source with the lorentz factor @xmath8 a few slows down to mildly relativistic velocities at large distances , the dissipated jet kinetic energy can be several times larger than the one available in terminal shocks .",
    "this amount is sufficient to explain additional pressure component providing stability of radio lobes against pressure of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "if the above interpretation is true , then some further consequences of the discussed accelerating process may arise",
    ". in particular acceleration of nuclei could be energetically inefficient in purely electron - positron jets , leading to less efficient jet breaking at large scales .",
    "also , if the considered energetic particles escape from the radio lobes too fast , the required internal pressure component could not be sustained .",
    "a series of such problems are under study now ."
