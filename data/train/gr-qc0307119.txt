    "the observable is a suitable combination of the orbital residuals of the nodes of lageos and lageos ii and the perigee of lageos ii according to an idea exposed in @xcite .",
    "the relativistic signal is a linear trend with a slope of almost 60.2 milliarcseconds per year ( mas yr@xmath15 in the following ) .",
    "the standard , statistical error is evaluated as 2@xmath0 .",
    "the claimed total accuracy , including various sources of systematical errors , is of the order of @xmath16 .",
    "the main sources of systematical errors in this experiment are    * the unavoidable aliasing effect due to the mismodelling in the classical secular precessions induced on @xmath8 and @xmath9 by the even zonal coefficients @xmath17 of the multipolar expansion of the terrestrial gravitational field @xcite * the non  gravitational perturbations affecting especially the perigee of lageos ii @xcite .",
    "their impact on the proposed measurement is difficult to be reliably assessed    it turns out that the mismodelled classical precessions due to the first two even zonal harmonics of the geopotential @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the most insidious source of error for the lense  thirring measurement with lageos and lageos ii .",
    "the combination of @xcite is insensitive just to @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "according to the full covariance matrix of the egm96 gravity model @xcite , the error due to the remaining uncancelled even zonal harmonics amounts to almost 13@xmath0 @xcite . however , if the correlations among the even zonal harmonic coefficients are neglected and the variance matrix is used , amounts to 46.6@xmath0 @xcite . with this estimate the total error of the lageos  lageos ii  experiment would be of the order of 50@xmath0 .      the originally proposed lageos iii",

    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ table1 ]    the choice of the particular value of the inclination for lares is motivated by the fact that in this way , by using as observable the sum of the nodes of lageos and lares , it should be possible to cancel out to a very high level all the contributions of the even zonal harmonics of the geopotential , which depends on @xmath26 , and add up the lense  thirring precessions which , instead , are independent of @xmath25",
    ". the use of the nodes would allow to reduce greatly the impact of the non  gravitational perturbations to which such keplerian orbital elements are rather insensitive @xcite .    of course",
    ", it would not be possible to obtain practically two orbital planes exactly 180 deg apart due to the unavoidable orbital injection errors which can be considered of the order of 0.51 deg .",
    "in figure 1 , page 4314 of @xcite and figure 1 , page 1267 of @xcite the impact of such source of error on the originally proposed lageos ",
    "lares mission has been shown .",
    "it could amount up to 4@xmath0 for an injection error of 1 deg in the inclination of lares .",
    "in @xcite an alternative observable based on the combination of the residuals of the nodes of lageos , lageos ii and lares and the perigee of lageos ii and lares has been proposed .",
    "it would allow to cancel out the first four even zonal harmonics so that the error due to the remaining even zonal harmonics of the geopotential would be rather insensitive both to the orbital injection errors in the lares inclination and to the correlations among the even zonal harmonic coefficients . it would amount to @xmath27@xmath6 only @xcite .    in regard to the present status of the lares project ,",
    "unfortunately , up to now , although its very low cost with respect to other much more complex and expensive space  based missions , it has not yet been approved by any national space agency or scientific institution .",
    "optis @xcite is a recently proposed satellite  based mission which would allow for much improved tests of    * the isotropy of the velocity of light * the independence of the velocity of light from the velocity of the laboratory * the universality of the gravitational redshift .",
    "this mission is based on the use of a spinning drag  free satellite in an eccentric , high  altitude orbit which should allow to perform a three orders of magnitude improved michelson ",
    "morley test and a two order of magnitude improved kennedy  thorndike test .",
    "moreover , it should also be possible to improve by two orders of magnitude the tests of the universality of the gravitational redshift by comparison of an atomic clock with an optical clock .",
    "the proposed experiments are based on ultrastable optical cavities , lasers , an atomic clock and a frequency comb generator .",
    "since it is not particularly important for the present version of the mission , the final orbital configuration of optis has not yet been fixed ; in @xcite a perigee height of 10000 km and apogee height of 36000 km are provisionally proposed assuming a launch with a ariane 5 rocket .",
    "the requirements posed by the drag  free technology to be used , based on the field emission electrical propulsion ( feep ) concept , yield orbital altitudes not less than 1000 km . on the other hand , the eccentricity should not be too high in order to prevent passage in the van allen belts which could affect the on  board capacitive reference sensor .",
    "moreover , the orbital period @xmath28 should be shorter than the earth s daily rotation of 24 hours . the orbital configuration proposed in @xcite",
    "would imply a semi major axis @xmath29 km and an eccentricity @xmath30 . with such values",
    "the difference of the gravitational potential @xmath31 , which is relevant for the gravitational redshift test , would amount to = ~1.810 ^ -10 , where @xmath32 is the newtonian gravitational constant , @xmath33 the mass of earth and @xmath34 the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the result of is about three orders of magnitude better than that obtainable in an earth  based experiment .",
    "an essential feature of optis is the drag  free control of the orbit .",
    "free motion is required for the special and general relativistic tests which are carried through using optical resonators .",
    "even very small residual accelerations of @xmath35 may distort the resonators leading to error signals . as a by  product",
    ", this drag  free control also guarantees a very high quality geodesic motion which may be used , when being tracked , as probe of orbital relativistic gravitational effects .    for a drag  free motion of the satellite a sensor measuring the actual acceleration and thrusters counteracting any acceleration to the required precision",
    "are needed .",
    "the sensor , which is based on a capacitive determination of the position of a test mass , has a sensitivity of up to @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "these systems have a lifetime of many years .      in this contribution",
    "we wish to show that the rather free choice of the orbital parameters of optis and the use of a new drag  free technology open up the possibility to extend its scientific significance with new important general relativistic gravitomagnetic tests as well .",
    "indeed , it would be of great impact and scientific significance to concentrate as many relativistic tests as possible in a single mission , including also measurements in geodesy , geodynamics and earth monitoring .",
    "another important point is that optis is currently under serious examination by a national space agency - the german dlr .",
    "then , even if it turns out that optis would yield little or no advantages for the measurement of the lense  thirring effect with respect to the originally proposed lares , if it will be finally approved and launched it will nevertheless be a great chance for detecting , among other things , the lense - thirring effect .",
    "the main characteristics of such a mission are the already mentioned drag  free technique for optis and the slr technique for tracking .",
    "today it is possible to track satellites to an accuracy as low as a few mm .",
    "this may be further improved in the next years .",
    "it seems that an orbital configuration of optis identical to that of lares of table 1 would not be in dramatic contrast with the requirements for the other originally planned tests .",
    "for example , with the lares orbital configuration the difference in the gravitational potential @xmath37 would be of the order of @xmath38 , which is only one order of magnitude smaller than the one that could be obtained with the originally proposed optis configuration .    by assuming for optis the same orbital configuration of lares the following combination yields high accuracy ^lageos+c_1^lageos  ii+c_2^optis+c_3^optis  = 61.8_lt , with c_1 ~310 ^ -3 ,  c_2 ~9.910 ^ -1 ,  c_3 ~110 ^ -3 .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 is 0 in galileo ",
    "newton mechanics and 1 in gtr .",
    "the resulting relativistic signal would be a linear trend with a slope of 61.8 mas yr@xmath15 .",
    "the combination of cancels out the first three even zonal harmonics so that the systematic error due to the remaining harmonics of higher degree amounts to @xmath40 the variance matrix of egm96 up to degree @xmath41 has been used .",
    "it can be shown that this result is insensitive to the orbital injection errors in the inclination of optis .    with regard to the non - gravitational perturbations on the lageos satellites , only the contributions of the nodes of lageos and lageos ii , weighted by the small coefficients of ,",
    "have to be considered .",
    "this is quite relevant in the final error budget because , as already pointed out , the nodes of the lageos satellites , contrary to the perigees of these laser - ranged satellites , are orbital elements much less sensitive to the action of the non  gravitational perturbations . with regard to the effect on the non",
    " gravitational perturbations on the optis satellite , it turns out that , by assuming a residual unbalanced acceleration of @xmath42 cm s@xmath43 , the impact of the node of optis would be of the order of @xmath44 and that of the perigee of optis would be of the order of @xmath45 in view of the coefficients of .",
    "so , according also to the evaluations of table 2 and table 3 of @xcite , over @xmath46 = 7 years @xmath47 last but not least , note that the impact of the perigee of lageos ii , difficult to be modelled at a high level of accuracy , is absent .",
    "so , the total final systematic error budget in measuring the lense  thirring effect with should be better than @xmath48 . perhaps the major point of conflict between the original designs of the optis and lares missions",
    "is represented by the eccentricity @xmath22 of the orbit of the spacecraft .",
    "indeed , while for the gravitational redshift test , given by , a relatively large value of @xmath22 is highly desirable , the originally proposed lares orbit has a smaller eccentricity .",
    "the point is twofold : on one hand , it is easier and cheaper , in terms of requirements on the performances of the rocket launcher , to insert a satellite in a nearly circular orbit , and , on the other , the present status of the ground segment of slr would assure a uniform tracking of good quality for such kind of orbits .",
    "in fact , the large eccentricity of the originally proposed optis configuration , contrary to the other existing geodetic satellites of lageos  type , would not allow for a uniform coverage of the laser  ranged data in the sense that certain portions of the orbit might remain poorly tracked .",
    "however , the originally proposed optis mission implies the use of a ariane 5 rocket to insert the spacecraft into a gto orbit and , then , the use of a kick motor .",
    "moreover , it may be reasonable to assume that , when optis / lares will be launched , the network of slr ground stations will have reached a status which will allow to overcome the problem of reconstructing rather eccentric orbits to a good level of accuracy .",
    "then , a reasonable compromise between the optis and lares requirements could be an eccentricity of , say , @xmath49 .",
    "in that case yields a gravitational redshift of @xmath50 . with regard to the lense  thirring effect , it turns out that the error due to the even zonal harmonics of geopotential would amount , from , to 1.5@xmath0 , according to the variance matrix of egm96 up to degree @xmath41 .",
    "also in this case it would be insensitive to the orbital injection errors in the inclination .",
    "however , the forthcoming earth gravitational models from champ @xcite and grace @xcite should greatly improve such estimates . with a larger eccentricity",
    "the impact of the non  gravitational perturbations would be reduced and , on the other hand , the accuracy of the measurement of the various post  newtonian gravitational effects on the optis / lares perigee would be increased .",
