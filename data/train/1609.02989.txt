    "the _ herschel space observatory _ has revealed a wide - ranging network of elongated ( filamentary ) structures in molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . even though filamentary structures in molecular clouds were already well established ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the herschel continuum maps of dust emission at 70 - 500 @xmath0 m have achieved unprecedented sensitivity and revealed a deeper network of filaments , in both star - forming and non - star - forming molecular clouds .",
    "this implies that the filamentary network is an imprint of initial conditions , likely turbulence , rather than the result of pure gravitational instability .",
    "furthermore , the prestellar cores and protostars , when present , are preferentially found along massive filaments .    much interpretation of the filaments has been based on the assumption that they are isothermal cylinders . this simplifies their analysis as their observed shape is then independent of most viewing angles and one can rely on established theoretical results about the equilibrium or collapse of infinite cylinders . @xcite interpreted the observations in terms of the critical line mass of an isothermal cylinder @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the isothermal sound speed . for a mass per unit length @xmath3 ,",
    "a cylinder undergoes indefinite collapse as long as the gas is isothermal , and for @xmath4 it can settle into an equilibrium structure , although still unstable to clumping along its length into jeans length sized fragments @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that star formation is initiated when @xmath3 .",
    "a challenge to the view of filaments as cylinders is the magnetic field alignment inferred from polarized emission .",
    "@xcite find that large scale magnetic fields are aligned perpendicular to the long axis of the massive star - forming filaments ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this makes a circular symmetry of a cylinder about the long axis unlikely unless the magnetic field strength is dynamically insignificant .",
    "a more natural configuration is a magnetic ribbon , a triaxial object that is flattened along the direction of the large - scale magnetic field with its shortest dimension in that direction . in the lateral direction to the magnetic field",
    ", elongated structures can form due to turbulence and gravity .",
    "indeed , simulations of turbulence accelerated star formation in a strongly magnetic medium @xcite show the formation of ribbon - like structure in a layer that is flattened along the magnetic field direction .",
    "magnetic ribbons have recently been investigated theoretically by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they study magnetohydrostatic equilibria of ribbons that arise from a parent filament of radius @xmath5 , which is a free parameter in the problem .",
    "they find that a critical line - mass - to - flux ratio exists for collapse , in analogy to the critical mass - to - flux ratio for axisymmetric three - dimensional objects @xcite .",
    "a further challenge to filaments modeled as isothermal cylinders comes from the dust emission measurement of the fwhm of the mean column density profile relative to the axis of a filament @xcite .",
    "for example , figure 7 of @xcite shows that the fwhm values for 90 filamentary structures in low mass star forming regions cluster around a mean of @xmath6 pc with some scatter over two orders of magnitude range of mean column density pc for filaments in velocity - integrated emission and @xmath7 pc for filaments in individual velocity channels @xcite ] .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the central half - mass radius of an equilibrium isothermal cylinder is @xmath8 , essentially the jeans length , where @xmath9 is the central density .",
    "the projected column density of such a circularly symmetric configuration has a central flat region of size @xmath10 and column density @xmath11 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that we can also write @xmath12 . therefore , the approximate observed relation @xmath13 is unlike the expected @xmath14 .",
    "however , the observed set of values of the fwhm radii also intersect the line of jeans length at the median log column density , which implies that the jeans length may not be wholly unrelated to them .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the consequences of a magnetic ribbon model for molecular cloud filaments for the measured relation between apparent width and the observed column density .",
    "we argue that this is a more natural model for filaments and is based on the interplay between turbulence , strong magnetic fields , and gravitationally - driven ambipolar diffusion , rather than pure gravity and thermal pressure .",
    "we extend the analytic model of @xcite for the formation of magnetic ribbons that is based on numerical simulations .",
    "we derive a lateral width of a magnetic ribbon and use it to calculate a synthetic observed relation between apparent width in projection versus observed column density .",
    "dynamically important magnetic fields , corresponding to mass - to - flux ratios that range from subcritical to mildly supercritical , will lead to flattening along the magnetic field direction , and subsequent evolution will be primarily perpendicular to the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "even highly turbulent three - dimensional simulations @xcite show that the turbulence is eventually dominated by motions perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field .",
    "observations of some filaments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that show a large - scale magnetic field along the short dimension of the filament also support the idea of flattening along the field . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the scenario of turbulent compression acting primarily perpendicular to the magnetic field direction in an initially subcritical molecular cloud .",
    "this leads to the paradigm of turbulence accelerated star formation , in which star formation occurs with globally low efficiency and in turbulent compressed regions .",
    "these regions oscillate about an approximate force - balanced state until ambipolar diffusion creates supercritical pockets that collapse to form stars .",
    "we explore the consequences of this scenario by extending a semi - analytic model of @xcite that is based on numerical simulations .",
    "we consider local pressure balance of a compressed region in a subcritical cloud and neglect thermal pressure in comparison to magnetic pressure and the ram pressure of the flow .",
    "we assume that the cloud is stratified in the _ z_-direction , with compression happening primarily in the @xmath15 plane . here",
    "we simplify the analysis of the compression by limiting it to one direction , the _",
    "x_-axis ( fig .",
    "[ ribbon ] ) , as done by @xcite .",
    "the initial magnetic field strength is @xmath16 and the field strength increases upon compression until the magnetic pressure within the compressed ribbon balances the external ram pressure and magnetic pressure .",
    "hence the compression ends ( and oscillations may ensue ) when @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the nonlinear flow speed . assuming that the gas has adequate time to settle into hydrostatic equilibrium along the _ z_-direction , the half thickness of the cloud is @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "now if the ambipolar diffusion time is longer than the compression time @xcite , flux freezing is valid during compression , i.e. , @xmath20 for the surface density @xmath21 , equation ( [ fluxfreezing ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath22 using equation ( [ scaleheight ] ) and equation ( [ fluxfreezing1 ] ) in equation ( [ balance eq ] ) and with some simplifications we get @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the square of the initial alfvn speed of the cloud . the consequence of such compression results in the formation of magnetic ribbons of width @xmath25 and thickness @xmath26 , as they are flattened along the direction of magnetic field ( see fig . [ ribbon ] ) . for conservation of mass per unit length in the ribbon during the compression of the cloud @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the initial width ( along the _",
    "x_-axis ) and @xmath29 is the initial thickness of the cloud in the vertical direction ( _ z_-axis ) . using equation ( [ scaleheight ] )",
    ", we can simplify the above equation to @xmath30 by using equation ( [ densitylength ] ) in equation ( [ densityvelocity ] ) , we can express the final width of the filament as @xmath31^{-1}.\\ ] ] analysis of zeeman measurements of the magnetic field in molecular clouds presented by @xcite shows that the turbulent line width is comparable to the alfvn speed @xcite .",
    "if we make the plausible estimate that the flow speed is comparable to the alfvn speed , i.e. , @xmath32 , the filament width becomes @xmath33 the result illustrates the fact that the final width of a filament is _ independent _ of the density of the medium .",
    "instead it is a fraction of the initial length scale @xmath28 of the compressed region .",
    "[ ribbon ]          in the above theory , the final ribbon width @xmath25 is independent of its density , but does depend on the initial compression scale @xmath28 associated with turbulence .",
    "the origin and physics of @xmath25 is then quite different than that of the jeans length .",
    "what is @xmath28 then ? in the turbulent scenario that we adopt in this study , it would be associated with the dominant mode in the turbulent flow field in a molecular cloud . at this point , no first principles theory exists to calculate @xmath28 as the preferred mode of an instability that leads to molecular cloud turbulence .",
    "hence , we take guidance from observations to make an empirical estimate for @xmath28 .",
    "the column density maps used by @xcite to determine the mean filament width can also be used to estimate a mean spacing between filaments , which we identify with @xmath28 in our model .",
    "figure 3b of @xcite identifies 27 filaments in a dust emission map of the cloud ic 5146 .",
    "we use this same map to make an approximate measurement of @xmath28 . for each of the 27 filaments",
    ", we identify a center along the length ( spine ) of the filament .",
    "then for each filament we measure the distance to the nearest center point of another filament .",
    "we obtain a set of 20 unique distance measurements ( eliminating double counting in cases where two filaments are mutually each other s nearest neighbor ) .",
    "we ignore effects of an inclination angle @xmath34 in this analysis , which could mean that the measured distances are less than the actual distances by a factor @xmath35 .",
    "our measured filament spacings ( which we equate with @xmath28 ) have a minimum value 0.5 pc , a maximum value 2.2 pc , a median value 0.9 pc , and a mean value 1.0 pc .",
    "another way to constrain @xmath28 is through the star formation timescale in molecular clouds .",
    "since this number is widely accepted to be in the range 1 - 3 myr @xcite , and star formation is often coordinated along a filament over this timescale , we can place an upper limit ( again empirically ) on the compression timescale @xmath36 of a few myr .",
    "therefore the initial length scale that can trigger a compression can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath36 is as above and again using the alfvnic nature of turbulence .",
    "this further simplifies to @xmath38 where we have used pressure balance along the magnetic field , @xmath39 and the normalized mass - to - flux ratio @xmath40 .",
    "if we consider the initial cloud to be mildly subcritical , i.e. , @xmath41 , and a sound speed @xmath42 , then @xmath43 myr leads to @xmath44 pc .",
    "the simple arguments of the previous section show that the length scale at which the ribbon formation is initiated is of the order of a parsec .",
    "our semi - analytic model then implies that the final width of the ribbon given by equation ( [ intrinsic width ] ) is @xmath45 pc .",
    "however , the shortest dimension is flattened along the direction of the magnetic field and has a thickness @xmath26 that _ does _ depend on the column density .",
    "therefore , the observed shape will depend on the viewing angle .",
    "below we calculate the observed width for a particular viewing angle and then calculate a synthetic plot of observed ribbon width versus observed column density for a collection of random viewing angles .",
    "our objective is to gain insight into the form of the observed correlation , and how it compares with the standard jeans length scaling and with the observational results presented by @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath28 can be considered a free parameter and physically may vary from one cloud to another and have a distribution of values within a single cloud .",
    "while we do not advocate a specific individual value for @xmath28 , we use the empirical estimate that it should be @xmath46 pc to determine the shape and approximate quantitative values of an observed correlation .",
    "let the normal to the filament , along the",
    "_ z_-axis , be inclined at an angle @xmath47 to the observer as shown in fig .",

    "furthermore , different angular orientation of the magnetic ribbons in the _ x - y _ plane will also alter the observed column density . if the long axis ( _ y _ ) of the ribbon is not perpendicular the line of sight ( see fig .
