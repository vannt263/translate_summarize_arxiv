    "it is now widely accepted that the compact radio source sgra@xmath0 is associated with the presence of a black hole of mass @xmath7 m@xmath8 located at the dynamical center of the galaxy ( ghez et al .",
    "2003 , schdel et al .",
    "although sgra@xmath0 represents a relatively faint galactic nucleus , with l@xmath9 l@xmath10 ( melia & falcke 2001 ) , ongoing detections of variability and flares at radio , sub - millimeter , infrared , and x - ray wavelengths indicate that this is a dynamic object powered by accretion . at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths ,",
    "persistent variability of sgra@xmath0 has been observed to occur on time scales of weeks with @xmath113 active episodes per year , each lasting about a month ( herrnstein et al .",
    "2004 , zhao et al .",
    "2003 , falcke 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , there appears to be a time - lagged correlation between the centimeter and millimeter fluxes , with variations at shorter wavelengths appearing stronger in amplitude and peaking out before the longer wavelengths ( zhao et al .",
    "this is consistent with a model in which the higher frequency emission originates from smaller spatial scales , closer to the event horizon of the black hole",
    ". short - term variability of sgra@xmath0 at near - infrared ( ghez et al .",
    "2004 , genzel et al . 2003 ) and x - ray ( baganoff 2001 , 2003 ) wavelengths has also been observed recently .",
    "eckart et al . (",
    "2004 ) have reported the first simultaneous detection of an x - ray and nir flare from sgr a@xmath0 . clearly , characterizing the variability time scales at different wavelengths will help elucidate the structure and dynamics of this object .    also of interest",
    "are the effects of radiative transfer on our ability to detect variability on hourly time scales in the radio / sub - millimeter regime .",
    "the size of sgra@xmath0 is dominated by scattering from the turbulent interstellar plasma along the line of sight for @xmath12 3 mm and perhaps also by the optical depth of the plasma flow surrounding the black hole , resulting in a stratification of sgr a@xmath0 s appearance as a function of wavelength ( bower et al .",
    "owing to the latter , the shortest observed time scales for flux variations at millimeter and sub - millimeter wavelengths may reveal important information about the structure of the sgra@xmath0 photosphere , since the detectability of flux variations of a given region will depend on whether the variable flux emanates from within or outside the @xmath131 surface .",
    "one complication of the interpretation of measurements by interferometer arrays tracking sgra@xmath0 is the non - negligible flux component contributed by the extended thermal source sgra west , which is sampled in a time varying , baseline - dependent fashion during the observing track .",
    "atmospheric effects must also be controlled . to discriminate true variability from possible atmospheric fluctuations , one must interweave frequent measurements of a nearby phase calibrator with measurements of sgra@xmath0 , especially for interferometers in the northern hemisphere , where sgra@xmath0 is observed at low elevations . perhaps for these reasons , low - amplitude variability on hourly and sub - hourly time scales has seldom been claimed with any confidence .",
    "one exception has been the report of a 30@xmath14 intra - day flux increase and a 400@xmath14 flare with @xmath112-fold increase timescale of 1.5 hours at 2 mm by miyazaki et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and a 10@xmath14 increase at 15 ghz over a 2 hour period reported by bower et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    in this letter , we present the results of eight successive days of observation of sgra@xmath0 at 3 mm using caltech s owens valley radio observatory s millimeter interferometer ( ovro ) .",
    "this work was carried out as part of a multi - wavelength campaign , including the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    ", with the goal of observing radio counterparts to x - ray flares , although none occurred while ovro was observing sgra@xmath0 ( baganoff et al .",
    "nonetheless , the eight days of coverage analyzed here have enabled us to detect persistent , low - amplitude variations of sgr a@xmath0 on time scales of a few hours and to explore the nature of this intra - day variability .",
    "the galactic center ( sgra@xmath0 ) was observed with the ovro millimeter interferometer in the l configuration at elevations @xmath15 on each of the eight successive days of the multi - wavelength observing campaign ( 2002 may 2330 ) .",
    "the observing track each day lasted about 6 hours .",
    "data were recorded in both sidebands using 2 ifs ( offset from the local oscillator by @xmath16 1.5 , and @xmath16 3 ghz ) , resulting in a total continuum bandwidth of 4 ghz ( @xmath17=101.8 ghz during the first 3 days and @xmath17=96.3 ghz for the remaining 5 days ) .",
    "after measuring the fluxes of @xmath18 potential calibrator sources near sgr a@xmath0 in the week prior to the observing run , we chose j1744@xmath1312 , separated from sgra@xmath0 by only 2.29@xmath19 .",
    "its flux of 0.9 jy at 100 ghz is adequate for accurate amplitude and phase calibration and we observed it for 3 minutes after every 5 minute integration on sgra@xmath0 . during each track ,",
    "absolute flux calibration was done using the planets uranus and neptune , and was checked by observing secondary calibrators ( 3c273 , 3c345 , 3c454.3 , 3c84 , nrao 530 ) .",
    "the data were edited and calibrated with the caltech millimeter array reduction package mma . during most of the daily tracks the weather was exceptional for that time of the year .",
    "all eight days of data were used to construct our model of the source ( figure 1 ) and were phase - only self - calibrated in aips . to mimimize the inclusion of bad data",
    ", we deleted all visibilities with coherence @xmath200.8 .",
    "in order to discriminate between intrinsic flux variations in the central point source and flux variations due to changes in the spatial frequencies being sampled from sgra west ( figure 1 ) as the interferometer tracks the source across the sky , it is preferable to analyze the data in the @xmath2 plane . in removing the flux contribution of sgra west ,",
    "we make use of the fact that all visibilities in our data set are the vector sum of components from sgra@xmath0 and sgra west . for every visibility @xmath21 , we average the amplitudes and phases of all other visibilities @xmath22 within an averaging kernel of radius @xmath23 about @xmath21 .",
    "the amplitudes and phases are weighted inversely by their distance @xmath24 , in the @xmath2 plane , from the central visibility @xmath21 and by their intrinsic weight @xmath25 due to system noise ( we also experimented with gaussian kernels , although the resulting difference was negligible ) . the total weight for each visibility is then given by @xmath26 .",
    "we have constructed the size of @xmath23 to vary linearly with respect to distance from the @xmath2 origin .",
    "this accounts for the decreasing @xmath2 sampling density for the longer baselines , resulting in each averaging kernel having a comparable number of visibilities contributing to the average and thus uniform statistics throughout the entire @xmath2 plane . by choosing an appropriate scaling for @xmath23",
    ", we limit the intra - kernel phase variations due to source structure to @xmath27 , ensuring that all intra - kernel visibilities sample the same extended structure component of the source .",
    "the final kernel used has a radius range of 0.33.0 k@xmath28 for the shortest ( @xmath114 k@xmath28 ) to longest baselines ( @xmath1140 k@xmath28 ) .",
    "the average phase and amplitude of all remaining visibilities within the kernel are then used to construct a weighted average visibility @xmath29 that represents the global average of the data set ( all eight days of data ) in that @xmath2 sector .",
    "we then compute a residual visibility @xmath30 at each point by subtracting @xmath31 from @xmath32 and taking the real part of the difference : @xmath33 .",
    "thus , @xmath30 represents true variability of sgra@xmath0 , since the constant contribution from sgra west and the average value of sgra@xmath0 have been subtracted out .",
    "any variations due to atmospheric refraction would be evidenced in the imaginary part of the residuals of sgra@xmath0 ( which have been confirmed to be flat ) and in the real residuals of the calibrator j1744@xmath1312 , which was subjected to the same treatment . for flux reference",
    ", we assume that the calibrator flux is constant , and fix its value at 5 minute intervals and time - average the data using 10 minute bins .",
    "thus , we compare the real residual , intra - day fluxes of sgra@xmath0 with those from the calibrator j1744@xmath1312 for each day of the campaign .",
    "figure 2 shows the day - averaged flux residuals of sgra@xmath0 on each day of the campaign .",
    "figure 3 exhibits the intra - day variations , showing the real components of the residual visibility vectors of sgra@xmath0 ( column 1 ) and j1744@xmath1312 ( column 2 ) as well as the lomb - scargle power spectrum of the residuals ( solid curve , column 3 ) .",
    "each residual light curve in figure 3 is the average of the residuals from each separate baseline .",
    "all baselines exhibit residuals that are consistent with the average ; i.e. , the variations are not dominated by either short or long baselines .",
    "furthermore , we checked our result by the more conventional method of restricting our data set to only the longest baselines having @xmath2 spacings @xmath3430 k@xmath28 , calibrating on nrao 530 and j1744@xmath1312 separately .",
    "the results are consistent with those of the analysis method used here .    to characterize the flux variations , we subject the real residual visibilities of sgra@xmath0 to periodic analysis by deriving a lomb - scargle power spectrum ( scargle 1982 ) , designed for unevenly sampled time - series data .",
    "our high sampling rate and daily coverage enable us to explore variations on time scales of minutes to hours .",
    "benlloch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) illustrate the importance of significance estimation when characterizing time variations in agn .",
    "thus , to estimate the significance of our power spectra , we resort to monte carlo simulation . following an algorithm for generating power law noise ( timmer & knig 1995 )",
    ", we produced 5000 artificial red - noise light curves having the same statistical properties ( mean and variance ) and time sampling of the original data for each day .",
    "the artificial curves have power spectra that obey a power law with @xmath35 .",
    "figure 4 is the average of all intra - day power spectra of the data ( solid curve ) and of all simulated light curves with @xmath36 values of 1.0 , 1.5 , and 2.0 .",
    "figure 4 shows that a power spectrum with @xmath37 is a good fit to the data .",
    "thus , for each frequency bin , we superimpose on the power spectra in figure 3 ( column 3 ) the resulting 90% and 99% upper confidence level envelopes derived from 5000 simulated power spectra using @xmath37",
    ".    figures 3 & 4 show persistent power on time scales of a few hours , both in most of the individual days and in the average power spectrum .",
    "power at long periods on some days ( 46 hours ) is likely to represent an overall flux trend for those days .",
    "the rise and decay times of the flux residuals generally occur on a timescale of @xmath1112 hours , comparable to the timescales observed by previous experiments ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2004 and bower et al .",
    "it is unlikely that variable linear polarization or variable sampling of a constant , linearly polarized source through the fixed , linear feeds on the ovro millimeter array can explain the apparent variations in figure 3 , since the linear polarization of sgra@xmath0 at 3 mm has been constrained to @xmath381% ( bower et al .",
    "2003 ) . on several days ,",
    "notably may 27 and 28 , there is strong indication of power on time scales of 1.53 hours , some of which appears significant at more than the 99% confidence level derived from our monte carlo simulations .",
    "this shows up as a peak in the average power spectrum which rises above the best fitting red - noise power spectrum with @xmath36=1 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "finally , we note a suggestion of a correlation between the amplitude of few - hour variability and the average flux on a given day ( fig 2 ) ; may 27 and 28 , in particular , show the highest mean flux densities .",
    "this potential trend clearly needs confirmation .",
    "the peak at @xmath112.53 hours in the average power spectrum , if confirmed , would suggest that there be a characteristic time scale associated with the 3-mm emission .",
    "if we assume that this power spectral peak is due to the dynamical modulation of the emitting gas , we can use the black hole mass to compute a dynamical radius of @xmath39 au ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the intrinsic size of sgra@xmath0 taken from vlba closure - amplitude imaging ( bower et al .",
    "2004 ) suggests a major axis size of 6@xmath41 at 3 mm , which is consistent with the dynamical radius implied by the variability time scale .",
    "we speculate that the absence of significant variations on time scales less than 1 hour is owed to the fact that orbital radii with dynamical times less than this are enshrouded in the optically thick regime of the accretion flow at 3 mm .",
    "this would also constrain models in which short - term radio variability originate from shocks accompanying a jet ( markoff et al .",
    "2001 ) , if variability of this kind has no preferred time scale .",
    "future long - term monitoring is critical to accurately assess and characterize the variability of sgra@xmath0 on short time scales .",
    "the future atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) will undoubtedly expand our capabilities and help broaden our understanding of this intruiging source .",
