    "one of the most fascinating challenge in the stellar astrophysics is understanding the structures of realistic rotating stars and their evolution ( for example , see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "according to recent observations , many stars display detectable rotations .",
    "in fact , massive stars in particular , such as b and o stars , tend to have clearly rapid rotation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "approximately 10 per cent of them have the rotational velocities which are larger than 300 @xmath0 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such rapid rotational velocities can reach the critical velocity beyond which mass shedding due to rotation occurs and no equilibrium state exists ( @xcite ) , because the typical values of the critical velocities for 20 @xmath1 star with solar metallicity are @xmath2 300 @xmath0 - 600 @xmath0 during the main sequence phase ( @xcite ) .",
    "the shape of these rapidly rotating stars is oblate due to the centrifugal force .",
    "therefore , their outer layers can not be well described by spherical models due to their fast rotation and so non - spherical models are required to describe them .",
    "the structures of realistic rotating stars are described by using many realistic physical properties and processes such as viscosity , inhomogeneous chemical composition and meridional flows ( not considered in this paper ) . in general",
    ", the surfaces of equal density ( isopycnic surfaces ) and equal pressure ( isobaric surfaces ) do not coincide due to these physical properties and processes , i.e. the stars becomes baroclinic .",
    "[ fig : iso_surfaces ] displays two examples of rapidly rotating baroclinic stars .",
    "the isopycnic surfaces ( solid curves ) are inclined to the isobaric surfaces ( dashed curves ) .",
    "the isopycnic surfaces are more oblate than the isobaric surfaces in the left model , while the isobaric surfaces are more oblate than the isopycnic surfaces in the right model .",
    "therefore , the value of the density on the isobaric surface varies in the baroclinic star . on each isopycnic surface , the density in the left model increases from the pole to the equator , while the density in the right model decreases from the pole to the equator .",
    "these two models are different classes of baroclinic stars explained in detail in sec",
    "the baroclinicity is characterized by the angle between isopycnic surfaces and isobaric surfaces .",
    "it is assumed that the system is stationary and axisymmetric and the star does not have magnetic field and meridional flow , the euler equation of the rotating star is @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the density , the pressure , the gravitational potential and the angular velocity of the star .",
    "cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) are utilized in this equation .",
    "the @xmath9 component of the curl of this equation is @xmath11 if the isopycnic surfaces and the isobaric surfaces coincide , i.e. the pressure depends on the density only , the star is barotropic ( @xmath12 ) and the left - hand side of the equation vanishes .",
    "the rotation of the barotropic star is rigid ( @xmath13 , constant ) or cylindrical ( @xmath14 ) because the centrifugal force can be derived from a rotational potential ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the rotational potential that is an arbitrary function of @xmath8 .",
    "if the isopycnic surfaces are inclined to the isobaric surfaces , the left - hand side of equation ( [ eq : rot_euler ] ) does not vanish .",
    "the angular velocity distributions in the baroclinic stars are no longer constant and cylindrical due to the differences between isopycnic surfaces and isobaric surfaces .",
    "the situation is completely different from baroclinic star .",
    "therefore , baroclinicity is an important component to consider in order to investigate such realistic rotating stars and their evolution .",
    "nevertheless , only a few works have succeeded in obtaining baroclinic equilibrium states with rapid rotation self - consistently because it is difficult to calculate and analyse baroclinic stars .",
    "if it is assumed that the star is barotropic , the rotation becomes cylindrical and the centrifugal force can be derived from the potential in equation ( [ eq : rot_pot ] ) .",
    "therefore , the first integral of the euler equation can be obtained analytically as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the integral constant . since the system is barotropic ( @xmath12 ) , the integral of the left - hand side of this equation",
    "can be also calculated .",
    "this first integral of the euler equation is used by many previous works for obtaining rapidly rotating barotropic stars ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the situation of the baroclinic star is more complicated . if the star is baroclinic , the first integral of the euler equation can not be obtained analytically because the centrifugal force can not be derived from a rotational potential and the distributions of the angular velocity must be calculated self - consistently by solving equation ( [ eq : rot_euler ] ) .    in order to avoid this difficulty , many previous works treated rotating baroclinic stars as slowly rotating stars by using perturbative methods ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "others calculated self - consistent rotating equilibrium states , but treated rotating stars as pseudo - barotropic , i.e. isobaric surfaces and isopycnic surfaces are not inclined ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although these studies considered the thermal balance of a rotating star in these works , the isothermal surfaces are also isobaric and so the system is essentially barotropic . only a few works succeeded in obtaining rapidly rotating baroclinic stars self - consistently",
    ".    @xcite investigated self - consistent rotating baroclinic equilibrium states .",
    "they discretized all basic equations of fully radiative stars and calculated them simultaneously by using straight - forward newton - raphson scheme ( @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical code was extended by @xcite and more realistic stars with a convective core and radiative envelope were calculated .",
    "@xcite obtained self - consistent rotating baroclinic stars with shellular rotation using an iterative method ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite did not adopt a particular equation of state and did not solve a thermal balance equation .",
    "instead , both density and pressure distributions were obtained independently and calculated iteratively by fitting the radial profile of the angular velocity .",
    "@xcite succeeded in obtaining self - consistent rotating baroclinic stars with viscosity and meridional flows by using a pseudo - spectral method ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in their numerical code ,",
    "the physical variables are projected on to the spherical harmonics and solved iteratively via a generalized algorithm for polytropic stellar models ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the numerical code was improved and many realistic and complex solutions were obtained by @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite developed a new formulation and numerical method based on the lagrangian variational principle to obtain rotating self - gravitating configurations .",
    "they were able to obtain both rotating barotropic and baroclinic equilibrium sates consistently by using their new method .",
    "these studies have improved self - consistent rotating baroclinic models , but the basic understanding of rotating baroclinic stars is still unclear because there are only the few solutions of such stars that were developed in the aforementioned works .",
    "many solution sequences and systematic studies are required to improve the understanding of rotating baroclinic stars and their evolution .",
    "simple and powerful numerical methods are needed to systematically obtain solution sequences . as a first step towards realistic rotating stars and their evolution",
    ", this paper investigates a versatile numerical method for systematically obtaining structures of rapidly rotating baroclinic stars as well as solutions for baroclinic rotating stars .",
    "a simple equation of state is adopted in this paper in order to obtain rotating baroclinic stars easily and systematically . some previous self - consistent works adopted complex thermal balance equations , but the rotating baroclinic equilibrium state itself is determined without any explicit thermal balance equation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanical structures themselves are determined independently from assumed or additional thermal structures which are totally independently and freely introduced to mechanical structures in newtonian gravity .",
    "it should be noted that the mechanical part and the thermal part can not be separated in general relativistic situations because the total energy density is one of the source of the gravity in the einstein equations ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in the newtonian gravity framework , we can obtain rotating baroclinic stars systematically even when we ignore the thermal balance equation .",
    "this paper adopts a simple equation of state as a baroclinic equation of state , but a realistic equation of state could also be easily integrated into the method .",
    "this new method can calculate rapidly rotating baroclinic stars easily .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the formulation of the rotating baroclinic star and numerical scheme of the new method .",
    "section 3.1 verifies the accuracy of the numerical results and compares them with results obtained via another numerical scheme .",
    "the numerical results and solution sequences are displayed in section 3.2 .",
    "discussion is given in sections 4.1 and 4.2 .",
    "the paper is summarized in section 4.3 .",
    "the formulation and details of the numerical method are described in this section .",
    "the formulation of rotating baroclinic stars is summarized in section 2.1 .",
    "the remainder of this section focuses on explaining the new numerical scheme briefly .",
    "both spherical polar coordinates @xmath19 and cylindrical coordinates @xmath20 are utilized in the formulation , but spherical polar coordinates are employed in the actual numerical code .",
    "it is assumed that the system is in a stationary state and the configuration is axisymmetric about the rotational axis .",
    "it is also assumed that the configuration is equatorially symmetric .",
    "both meridional flow and magnetic field are neglected in this paper .",
    "although the meridional flow plays important role for secular transport processes in stellar interiors ( e.g. @xcite ) , the typical time - scale of the meridional flow is much longer than the dynamical time - scale of the star .",
    "it is almost negligible to consider the mechanical structures of the rapidly rotating star in equilibrium . under these assumptions ,",
    "the basic equations that describe the rotating baroclinic star are the euler equations @xmath21 @xmath22 the integral form of the poisson equation @xmath23 and a baroclinic equation of state @xmath24 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are , respectively , the density , the pressure , the gravitational potential , the angular velocity , the gravitational constant and a scalar function that characterizes a baroclinicity such as temperature @xmath27 or specific entropy @xmath28 . in this paper , the following analytic form of a simple equation of state is adopted : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 are parameters .",
    "@xmath35 is related to the specific entropy of the star . if we assume the ideal gas star ( @xmath36 ) , then @xmath35 is proportional to the specific entropy ( @xmath37 ) and the distribution of @xmath35 represents the distribution of the specific entropy . if the @xmath35 at the equator is lager than at the pole , the surface temperature is hotter at the equator than at the pole .",
    "if the @xmath35 at the equator is smaller than that at the pole the surface temperature is cooler at the equator than at the pole .",
    "although this equation of state is simple , two types of rotating baroclinic stars in fig .",
    "[ fig : iso_surfaces ] are obtained by this equation of state .",
    "spherical isentropic ( constant entropy ) and oblate isentropic models were investigated by fixing the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 of this analytic form of @xmath35 , noting that the isentropic surfaces becomes spherical when @xmath38 and oblate when @xmath39 respectively .",
    "the spherical isentropic model has the spherical isentropic surfaces and the oblate isentropic models has the oblate isentropic surfaces .",
    "these two types of isentropic models become two types of rotating baroclinic models in fig .",
    "[ fig : iso_surfaces ] .",
    "the value of @xmath30 denotes the degree of baroclinicity .",
    "if we fix @xmath40 , the system becomes barotropic since @xmath35 becomes constant and @xmath5 is a function of @xmath4 @xmath41 .",
    "however , if we choose @xmath42 , then @xmath35 is no longer constant and the system becomes baroclinic . as the absolute value of @xmath30 increases , the baroclinicity of the star also increases . as we will see in section 3 , this simple equation of state systematically provides various rotating baroclinic stars by fixing the parameters in this ways .",
    "since the isentropic surfaces are oblate in the oblate isentropic model , the @xmath35 at the equator is smaller than at the pole .",
    "therefore , the surface temperature of the oblate isentropic model is hotter at the pole than at the equator . from a observational point of view , the surface temperatures of the rapidly rotating early type stars are hotter at the poles than that at the equator ( e.g. @xmath43 leonis observed by @xcite ) by the gravitational darkening ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the oblate isentropic model might be favoured in massive stars , but both spherical and oblate isentropic models were calculated to obtain various rotating baroclinic stars systematically in this paper .",
    "the @xmath9 component of the curl of the euler equation is used in this numerical method instead of the @xmath44 component of the euler equation ( equation [ eq : eular_th ] ) , i.e. , @xmath45 using cylindrical coordinate , this equation can be rewritten as @xmath46 therefore , we can solve the distribution of @xmath7 by imposing a boundary condition on @xmath7 at the equatorial surface and integrating these equations directly . in this paper",
    ", we impose the following boundary condition on @xmath7 at the equatorial surface : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 are constants .",
    "this is a @xmath50-constant rotation law ( @xcite ) .",
    "the physical quantities are transformed to dimensionless ones for the actual numerical computations using the central density @xmath51 and the equatorial radius @xmath52 as follows : @xmath53",
    "@xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 where hat @xmath58 denotes a dimensionless quantity .",
    "note that the dimensionless value of the central density is unity in this form since @xmath59 the dimensionless pressure is obtained by the dimensionless form of the equation of state as @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are dimensionless parameters .",
    "thus , the central pressure @xmath64 can be obtained as @xmath65 the value of @xmath66 is determined to ensure a unity distance from the centre to the equatorial surface of the star ( @xcite ) .",
    "all equations are also transformed to be dimensionless .",
    "for instance , the profile of the angular velocity ( equation [ eq : boundary ] ) is transformed as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are dimensionless parameters .",
    "@xmath69 denotes the degree of the differential rotation .    in summary , the dimensionless forms of equations ( [ eq : eular_r ] ) , ( [ eq : poisson_int ] ) and ( [ eq : baroclinicity ] ) have been defined with the dimensionless equation of state ( equation [ eq : p_k_rho2 ] ) for the actual numerical calculation .",
    "next , the numerical scheme of the new method are described briefly .",
    "the details of the numerical scheme is described in appendix a. the numerical scheme adopts a self - consistent field iteration scheme ( @xcite ) .",
    "the gravitational field and all physical quantities are calculated iteratively in the self - consistent field scheme .",
    "in particular , the numerical schemed of the new method is based on hachisu s self - consistent field ( hscf ) scheme ( @xcite ) , which is a well - established numerical method for calculating rapidly rotating barotropic equilibrium states .",
    "however , the hscf scheme can not calculate rotating baroclinic stars because it uses the first integral of the euler equation ( equation [ eq : rot_phi ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the numerical scheme of the new method uses the differential forms of the euler equations ( equations [ eq : eular_r ] , [ eq : baroclinicity ] ) and can calculate rotating baroclinic stars self - consistently .",
    "the new method calculate these equations explicitly ( appendix a ) , while the previous studies for rotating baroclinic stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) adopted implicit calculations ( e.g. newton raphson method ) or spectral - type method to solve these equations numerically . since the implementation of the explicit method is much easier than those of the implicit method and spectral - type method ,",
    "the implementation of the new scheme is much easier than those of the previous works .",
    "we can calculate rotating baroclinic stars easily and stably by using the new scheme .    following the previous works ,",
    "the axis ratio is fixed during iteration cycles in the numerical scheme ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the axis ratio @xmath70 is defined as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the equatorial radius and the polar radius of the star , respectively .",
    "extremely rapidly rotating stars can be obtained stably by fixing the axis ratio @xmath70 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "numerical results obtained by our novel method are displayed in this section .",
    "the accuracy of the method is verified in section 3.1.1 . in section 3.1.2 ,",
    "numerical results are compared with results obtained via previous method to confirm the numerical results .",
    "two types of rotating baroclinic sequences are investigated by fixing the functional forms of the baroclinic equation of state with these new solutions displayed and discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "numerical accuracy and convergence checking are important when investigating a new numerical method . to check the numerical accuracy ,",
    "a relative value of the virial relation was computed as follows : @xmath74 where @xmath27 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are , respectively , the rotational energy , the total pressure of the star and the gravitational energy with @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 a numerical domain is defined as @xmath80 in the radial direction and @xmath81 in the angular direction . the number of the grid points in the @xmath82 direction within @xmath83 $ ] and that in the @xmath44 direction within @xmath84 $ ] are defined as @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "the numerical domains are discretized into mesh points with equal intervals @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( equations [ eq : app1 ] and [ eq : app2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the total mesh number is @xmath89 in the computations .",
    "@xmath90 was fixed during the test computations and the value of @xmath91 was changed .",
    "both barotropic ( @xmath92 ) and baroclinic ( @xmath93 ) solutions were calculated with @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",

    "are used .",
    "next , the solutions obtained by the new numerical method were compared with those obtained by hscf scheme to confirm the results .",

    "the specific entropy in these models also increases outward , but the equatorial specific entropy is lower than the polar specific entropy .",
    "these entropy distributions mean that the surface temperature is hotter at the poles than at the equator .",

    "the shellular - type rotation is realized even if the stellar rotation is as rapid as critical rotation .",
    "summarizing the above , these rotating baroclinic stars have oblate isentropic surfaces , and the isopycnic surfaces are more oblate than their isobaric surfaces due to the entropy distributions .",
    "such baroclinicity makes angular velocity similar to that observed for shellular - type rotation , and the value of @xmath108 always negative inside the star .",
    "this condition is also one of the bjerknes  rosseland rules ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , all of these rotating baroclinic stars satisfy the bjerknes  rosseland rules .",
    "stability analysis is an important problem to investigate for realistic rotating stars .",
    "many types of instabilities are known to occur in rotating baroclinic stars , but we restrict ourselves to the consideration of instabilities arising from the stellar rotation in this paper . in particular , we focus on the dynamical instability due to the rotation that occurs because the time - scales of the shear instability arising from the differential rotation and the thermal instability ( e.g. @xcite ) are much larger than that of the dynamical instability .",
    "we consider stability criteria derived from linear perturbation theory for rotating baroclinic stars .",
    "the stability criteria of rotating stars are characterized by the specific angular momentum ( @xmath110 ) distributions .",
    "according to the hiland criterion , a baroclinic star in permanent rotation is dynamically stable with respect to axisymmetric motions if and only if the two following conditions are satisfied : ( i ) the specific entropy @xmath28 never decreases outward , and ( ii ) on each surface @xmath111 constant ( specific entropy constant ) , the angular momentum per unit mass ( specific angular momentum @xmath50 ) increases from the poles to the equator ( @xcite ) .",
    "the thermal structures are totally independently and freely introduced to the mechanical structures in newtonian gravity , because the thermal structures are obtained by assuming and adding thermal balance equations .",
    "if the ideal gas is adopted as one of the simplest equation of state , the specific entropy is determined and becomes proportional to @xmath106 .",
    "as seen earlier in this paper , the specific entropy never increases outward in all of the rotating baroclinic solutions in this paper .",

    "[ fig : contours1 ] and [ fig : contours2 ] . as shown in these panels , the specific angular momentum on isentropic surface never decreases in both barotropic models .",
    "all of the rotating baroclinic stars in this paper also satisfy condition ( ii ) .",
    "therefore all of the rotating baroclinic stars satisfy the hiland criterion .",
    "they are dynamically stable configurations against dynamical instability due to rotation .",
    "further analysis of baroclinic rotating stars with realistic equations of state would be interest , but thermal balance ( energy equation ) must be solved to obtain the baroclinic stars with realistic equation of state .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we will construct realistic rotating baroclinic models using this new numerical method and systematically analyse their stability in future works .",
    "many stellar evolution codes for rotating stars have adopted shellular rotation as one of their rotation models ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the first shellular rotation model was formulated and derived by @xcite using a perturbative approach . when the turbulence is anisotropic with stronger matter transport in the horizontal directions than in the vertical , shellular rotation",
    "is realized ( @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", the horizontal - dependence of the angular velocity disappears and the angular velocity depends on only the distance from the centre of the star .",
    "this kind of shellular rotation was adopted as an initial rotation profile of core - collapse supernova simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , nobody had successfully investigated self - consistent configurations of rapidly rotating stars with shellular rotation systematically because of the difficulty of obtaining rotating baroclinic stars .",
    "some previous works showed self - consistent rotating baroclinic stars with non - cylindrical rotations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but their rotation distributions were far from shellular . on the other hand , @xcite calculated rotating baroclinic stars by fixing the distribution of the shellular rotation , but neither calculated solutions systematically nor obtained critical rotation models .",
    "@xcite investigated multi - layered configurations in differentially rotational equilibrium . while they did obtain rapidly rotating solutions systematically , they calculated rotating barotropic stars only .",

    "the oblate isentropic surfaces models were found to have shellular - type angular velocity distributions .",
    "the equatorial surface temperature of the rotating baroclinic star is hotter than the polar temperature .",
    "these kinds of entropy and temperature distributions generate shellular - type rotation .",

    "this kind of shellular - type rotation would be realized in many rapidly rotating stars .",
    "a versatile numerical method for obtaining structures of rapidly rotating baroclinic stars was investigated .",
    "the novel numerical method was based on the self - consistent field scheme and the solution was obtained iteratively .",
    "both rotating barotropic and baroclinic stars were calculated systematically by using the new method .",
    "the accuracy of the new method was verified by checking the convergence of numerical results .",
