    "it is well - known that in the presence of moving boundaries the vacuum state of the electromagnetic field may not be stable , which results in the generation of real photons .",
    "the generated radiation exerts pressure on the moving boundaries which can be looked upon as a dissipative force that opposes itself to the mechanical motion of the boundaries .",
    "the generation of photons , which is an amazing demonstration of the existence of quantum vacuum fluctuations of qed , is referred to in the literature as dynamical casimir effect @xcite or motion - induced radiation @xcite .",
    "it goes without saying that it would be very nice to have an experimental verification of this prediction . due to the technical difficulties involved in the detection of the phenomenon , up to",
    "now no concrete experiment has been carried out , and there are only some few experimental proposals @xcite . however , a feasible experimental evidence is not out of reach , and therefore it is of interest to explore different theoretical models to describe the process and identify signatures which permit to distinguish vacuum radiation from spurious effects .",
    "research in the field has mainly concentrated on one dimensional models , which are useful for giving an account of the main physical processes participating in the phenomenon ( a small number of works deal with more realistic three dimensional models @xcite ) . in this work we will also restrict ourselves to one dimesional models .",
    "motion induced effects of vacuum radiation already show up for a single mirror moving with a non - uniform acceleration in vacuum @xcite .",
    "since the amount of radiation generated is very small , basically determined by the ratio of the speed of the mirror to the speed of light , much attention has been paid to the study of one dimensional models for which the effect is enhanced .",
    "a cavity made of two perfectly parallel reflecting mirrors , one of which is motionless and the other one oscillates with a mechanical frequency equal to a multiple of the fundamental optical resonance frequency of the static cavity is a thoroughly studied example where such an enhancement takes place @xcite .",
    "it is typically considered that the cavity is motionless and that at some instant one mirror starts to oscillate resonantly with a tiny amplitude . for small times after the motion starts , one can make a perturbative expansion of the equations of motion of the field in terms of the small amplitude to find an approximate solution . in this way one can study the structure of the electromagnetic field inside the cavity , which departs from the standard static casimir profile ( which is constant over the whole cavity ) and develops a structure of small and broad pulses .",
    "the number of motion - induced photons grows quadratically in time , and the spectrum has an inverted parabolic shape with an upper frequency cut - off given by the mechanical frequency , its maximum being at half that value @xcite .",
    "similar results are found in @xcite by means of a scattering approach for the radiation emitted out of a lossy cavity .",
    "however , for long times these methods are not valid , and new approximation techniques are required .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that in such a limit the structure of the electromagnetic field is non trivial , with a number of pulses equal to the mechanical resonant frequency , whose width decreases exponentially and whose height increases exponentially with time , in such a way that the total energy within the cavity grows exponentially at the expense of the energy given to the system to keep the mirror moving . also , the spectrum does not have an upper frequency cut - off . through a process of frequency up - conversion , the generated photons contain frequencies of higher order cavity modes and thus exceed the mechanical frequency .",
    "the physical mechanism of such an optical pumping into the high frequency region is the doppler up - shift of the field upon reflection at the mirrors .",
    "similar conclusions are found for the lossy cavity @xcite .",
    "the case of cavitites with two moving mirrors has also been considered recently . in the small time approximation , both for the ideal cavity @xcite and for the lossy one @xcite , it is found that the number of motion - induced photons grows quadratically in time and that the spectrum is once again parabolic . in the long time approximation ,",
    "the lossy cavity has been studied with the scattering approach @xcite . just as in the case of a single oscillating mirror",
    ", it is found that in this regime , and for the two types of motion described above , there is pulse shaping in the time domain and frequency up - conversion in the spectrum of emitted photons from the cavity .",
    "a striking feature of the spectrum is that no photons are emitted at frequencies equal to multiple integers of the mechanical frequency .    in this work",
    "we will consider an ideal cavity with two mirrors oscillating resonantly at the same frequency , and we will allow for different amplitudes and a possible dephasing between the mirrors . to investigate the problem we will deduce a generalization of moore s equation @xcite to the problem of two moving boundaries , whose solution gives the complete information on the electromagnetic field inside the cavity . for the case of resonant harmonic motions , no exact solution exists , and we find an approximate analytic solution based on a renormalization group ( rg ) technique .",
    "we have already applied this method in @xcite for the case of a single oscillating mirror , and just as in that case , the strategy allows to find a single solution valid both for small and long times .",
    "this will allow us to describe precisely the bahaviour of the energy density and the number of photons for all times .    as we shall see",
    ", motion - induced radiation strongly depends on the relation among the amplitudes of oscillation , the frequency and the dephasing . for some relations among these variables ,",
    "there is constructive interference and a series of pulses develop within the cavity that grow exponentially in time , and frequency up - conversion takes place .",
    "for some other relations , there is destructive interference and hence no vacuum radiation .",
    "we also show that our solution is capable of accounting for other physical behaviours , for which the peaks grow quadratically rather than exponentially .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we will introduce the generalization of moore s equations for a moving cavity and we will explain how to calculate the energy density and the number of motion - induced photons . in section 3 the renormalization group method is described and applied to the problem of harmonically oscillating walls with dephasing . in section 4",
    "we study some particular dephasings , which we will call translational and breathing modes . in section 5",
    "another motion is considered , which has a cualitatively different behaviour as compared to those of the previous section .",
    "finally in section 6 we make our conclusions .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional cavity formed by two perfectly reflecting mirrors , each of which follows a given trajectory , say @xmath0 for the left mirror and @xmath1 for the right one .",
    "these two trajectories are predetermined ( i.e. are given data for the problem ) and act as time - dependent boundary conditions for the electromagnetic field inside the cavity .",
    "the field equation for the vector potential takes the form of the equation for a massless scalar field @xmath2 and the boundary conditions are @xmath3 for all times .",
    "if we express the field in terms of creation @xmath4 and annihilation @xmath5 operators for photons in the form @xmath6 , \\ ] ] then the mode functions @xmath7 must be chosen so as to satisfy the above boundary conditions .    in the case when only one of the walls moves , say the right one , the modes can be written in terms of a function @xmath8 as @xmath9 , \\ ] ] and the boundary condition on the right is met provided that the function @xmath10 verifies @xmath11 , which is known as moore s equation @xcite .",
    "the complete solution to the problem involves finding a solution @xmath8 in terms of the prescribed motion @xmath1 .",
    "moore s equation can in fact be deduced by means of a conformal transformation from the original spacetime coordinates @xmath12 to a new set of coordinates @xmath13 in which not only the left mirror but also the right one is fixed .",
    "this transformation takes the form @xmath14 which , after mapping the coordinate of the left mirror as @xmath15 and for the right one @xmath16 , leads to moore s equation .",
    "let us now consider the more general case in which both mirrors move .",
    "evidently we can also make a similar conformal transformation , but know we need two functions @xmath10 instead of one . defining the transformation as @xmath17 and mapping @xmath0 and @xmath1 as before , we obtain a set of generalized moore s equations @xmath18 which , when solved for given motions for the mirrors , allow us to find the solution for the modes inside the cavity .",

    "for resonantly harmonic motions it is not possible to find an exact solution to eqs.([general ] ) and approximation methods are compelling . a naive approach is to make perturbations in the amplitude of the oscillation , but it turns out that the strategy is ill - fated , because of the appearance of secular terms proportional to the time which , after a short period , make the approximation break down . in @xcite we have applied a method inspired in the renormalization group to treat these singular perturbations for the case of a one dimesional cavity with one oscillating mirror .",
    "the method has a wide range of application in different fields , especially for studying ordinary differential equation problems involving boundary layers , multiple scales , etc . @xcite . in the following",
    "we shall extend the method for the case of a one dimensional cavity whose mirrors oscillate in resonance with the cavity .",

    "however , they are crucial for the solution to satisfy the correct boundary conditions at short times ( @xmath108 ) .    the energy density inside the cavity is given by eq.([t00 ] ) in terms of derivatives of @xmath23 and @xmath24 . since these expressions involve second and third derivatives of these functions , and since there is an initial discontinuity of the velocities of the mirrors , the energy density will develop @xmath179 function singularities that will be infinitely reflected back and forth between the mirrors . in what follows",

    "we compare the case of the shaker with that of a single oscillating mirror .",
    "the difference in height and width of the peaks between these two situations are due to the fact that the parameter @xmath131 for the shaker is twice that of the single mirror .",

    "photons are created in the odd modes only , whereas their amount in even mode is zero ( it may be different from zero in the next - to - leading order approximation ) .",
    "this situation is typical of processes involving parametric excitations @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss another particular motion of the walls , namely one for which the left mirror is static and the right one oscillates resonantly , with a dephasing @xmath140 .",
    "the motion we consider in then @xmath222 , which for @xmath215 corresponds to the small @xmath56-expansion of an exact solution to moore s equation studied in @xcite .",
    "our motivation for studying this peculiar case is that for this motion we have @xmath137 and @xmath138 , which , as we have anticipated , gives cualitatively different physical results .",
    "the expressions for the functions @xmath169 and @xmath170 are obtained taking the limit @xmath223 of eqs.([a0]-[bqj ] ) .",

    "the solution @xmath169 develops a staircase profile , the jumps being located at values of @xmath48 for which the argument of the logarithm in eq.([glaw ] ) vanishes , i.e. for @xmath226 , where the plus sign corresponds to even @xmath180 and the minus sign to odd @xmath180 .",
    "the energy density for this type of motions also consists of a series of @xmath180 peaks that travel between the mirrors .",
    "the cualitative difference is that in this case the height of the peaks grows as @xmath227 , their width decreases as @xmath228 and the total energy contained in the cavity grows quadratically rather than exponentially .",
    "this follows from the fact that time enters in the logarithm of eq.([glaw ] ) as a power law instead of an exponential , as in eqs.([gshaker],[fshaker ] ) .",
    "next we calculate the amount of motion - induced radiation for this case . to this end",
    "we assume that at time @xmath34 the wall comes to rest , @xmath229 for @xmath37 , where @xmath45 is of the form @xmath230 .",
    "this choice for the stopping time simplifies the computation of the the bogoliubov coefficients @xmath231 .",
    "in such a case eq.([bog ] ) is slightly modified @xmath232\\}.\\ ] ] now @xmath202 consists of the first two terms of eq.([glaw ] ) , the first being linear in time and the second one being an oscillating function for late times , whose period is @xmath233 .",

    "the results are similar . ]",
    "@xmath238 where @xmath239^{-1 } \\ll 1 $ ] for late times .",
    "now the integral in eq.([betalaw ] ) is straightforward , and after dropping the integral over the first interval @xmath240 $ ] , which is proportional to @xmath179 , one can get a closed expression for the bogoliubov coefficients , valid as long as @xmath214 .",
    "for comparison with @xcite we concentrate on the case @xmath215 . in this case we have @xmath241 \\frac{1-(-1)^m \\cos(3 \\pi n \\delta/2)}{(m+3\\pi n \\delta/2)^2 } .\\ ] ] finally , we perform the summation over @xmath46 to get the number of created photons in the @xmath46-th mode . using the same summation formulas as in @xcite we get @xmath242.\\ ] ] replacing the value for @xmath179 and taking the @xmath45-derivative ,",
    "we get the following formula for the rate of photon production , valid in the limits @xmath214 and @xmath219 @xmath243 \\frac{1}{t}.\\ ] ] we see that the number of photon per mode grows logarithmically in the stopping time , and in consequence the rate of photon creation decreases towards zero . similarly to the case of the vibrating cavity , photons are produced only in odd modes .",
    "in this paper we have presented a unified and analytic treatment of the dynamical casimir effect in a one dimensional resonantly oscillating cavity for arbitrary amplitudes and dephasings .",
    "we have derived a generalization of moore s equation to describe the state of the electromagnetic field inside the cavity with two moving mirrors . using a technique inspired in the renormalization group method ,",
    "we have found a solution to the set of generalized moore s equations which is valid both for short and long times .",
    "the physical behaviour of the moving cavity depends crucially on the relation among amplitudes , frequency and dephasing .",
    "we have shown that for certain cases there is destructive interference and no radiation is generated .",
    "for others , there is constructive interference and motion - induced photons appear .",
    "when this takes place , the way the energy within the cavity and the number of created photons grow in time depends on the relation among the above variables . for certain motions",
    "the growth of the energy density is exponentially and for some others it is a power law .",
    "we hope in the future to apply the rg method to more realistic situations , such as three dimensional oscillating cavities with rectangular or spherical shapes .",
