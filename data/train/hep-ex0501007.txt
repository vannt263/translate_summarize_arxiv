    "the tevatron ( run ii ) collides protons and anti - protons head - on at a center - of - mass energy of 1.96 tev . in such collisions , the standard model ( sm )",

    "top quarks are expected to decay almost exclusively to a w boson and a b quark .",
    "when one w decays leptonically , the @xmath0 event contains a high transverse momentum lepton , missing energy from the unrecorded neutrino , and 4 high transverse momentum jets , 2 of which originate from b quarks .",
    "we use this decay channel to measure the total @xmath2 production cross section . a deviation from the predicted value",
    "would be an indication of new physics either in the production mechanism or in the top decay .",
    "we select events with an isolated electron e@xmath5 ( muon p@xmath5 ) greater than 20 gev , missing e@xmath620 gev and at least 3 jets with e@xmath615 gev and @xmath7 .",
    "finally , we require at least one jet in the event to be identified as a heavy flavor jet , either using a secondary vertex algorithm ( secvtx ) , or a soft lepton tagger ( slt ) that identifies muons from b hadron semileptonic decays .",
    "the analyzes using secvtx ( resp .",
    "slt ) are based on @xmath8 ( resp .",
    "@xmath9 ) of data .",
    "the cdf detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we optimize the event selection by requiring that the total transverse energy in the event ( @xmath10 , the scalar sum of all jets @xmath11 , lepton @xmath12 , and missing @xmath11 ) be larger than 200  gev .",
    "the secvtx algorithm selects tracks within the jet with large impact parameter to reconstruct secondary vertices .",
    "jets containing a secondary vertex more than @xmath13 away form the primary vertex ( in the plane transverse to the beam ) are identified as b - jets . after tuning the simulation on a control sample , the efficiency for tagging at least one jet in a @xmath0 event that passes all other selection requirements is ( @xmath14 )  % .",
    "the main sources of background are w + heavy flavor events , w + light jets events where one jet is wrongly tagged , and qcd events that fake a w signal ; they are estimated with techniques that use both monte carlo and data control samples .",
    "we expect @xmath15 background events and observe 48 events in the data ; we measure a cross section of @xmath16 .",
    "[ fig : njets_tags ] shows the number of candidate events vs jet multiplicity together with the expected background contributions .",
    "[ fig : ht ] shows the @xmath10 variable distribution of the candidates compared to the expected background and @xmath0  signal ( normalized to 6.7 pb ) .",
    "the sub - sample of events with at least two tagged jets contains 8 events , compared to an expected background of @xmath17  events , from which we measure a cross section of @xmath18 .",
    "instead of explicitly evaluating the contribution to the sample from backgrounds , one can extract the @xmath0 fraction by fitting some kinematic variable in the data .",
    "the leading jet @xmath11 variable was chosen for this purpose .",
    "template shapes for the background are evaluated from the data ; the template shape for @xmath0 is from monte carlo . the fit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ) measures a @xmath0 fraction of @xmath19  % , leading to a cross section of @xmath20 .",
    "the muon slt algorithm matches tracks in the central drift chamber with segments in the muon chambers .",
    "it uses a global @xmath21 built from the matching distributions , to define a pseudo - likelihood variable , @xmath22 , that separates muon candidates from background .",
    "a jet is considered `` tagged '' if it contains an slt muon with p@xmath23 3 gev / c , with @xmath243.5 and within @xmath250.6 of the jet axis .",
    "efficiency and fake rate are measured on control samples .",
    "backgrounds are estimated with techniques similar to sec .",
