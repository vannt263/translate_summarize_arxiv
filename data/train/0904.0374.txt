    "over 300 planet - hosting stars are known today , approximately 20 of them being evolved stars that have left the main sequence already . as",
    "the population of hosts of extrasolar planets grows fast it has become very interesting to look for statistical properties of these objects and possible correlations between fundamental stellar parameters and planet occurrence to understand better the planetary formation scenario .",
    "+ one of the most intriguing features of planet hosting stars , the metallicity enhancement for main - sequence dwarfs was found and described by gonzalez ( @xcite ) and santos  ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the case of",
    "fgk - type dwarfs the spectroscopic studies by fisher & valenti ( @xcite ) have demonstrated that extrasolar planets tend to be discovered more often around stars revealing higher metallicity .",
    "giants hosting exoplanets do nt seems to be metal - rich objects ( pasquini  @xcite ; hekker  @xcite , @xcite ) but due to small statistics these results remain uncertain still . in this paper",
    "we attempt to verify the planet occurrence vs. host metallicity relation for giants using a sample of 80 late - type giants from our survey ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the observational material used in this work are high quality , high - resolution optical spectra of late - type stars observed within our survey .",
    "most of them are unstudied before objects and only hd  17092 and hd  102272 are already known as planet hosting stars ( niedzielski  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "observations were made with the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) ( ramsey  @xcite ) equipped with the high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) ( tull @xcite ) in the queue scheduled mode ( shetrone @xcite ) . the spectrograph was used in the r=60.000 resolution mode and it was fed with a 2 arcsec fiber .",
    "the spectra consisted of 46 echelle orders recorded on the blue ccd chip ( 407.6 - 592 nm ) and 24 orders on the red one ( 602 - 783.8 nm ) .",
    "typical signal to noise ratio was 200 - 250 per resolution element .",
    "the basic data reduction were performed using standard iraf tasks and scripts .    to estimate fundamental stellar parameters such as effective temperature , surface gravity , microturbulence velocity and metallicity we use a purely spectroscopic method based on analysis of iron lines .",
    "we therefore need equivalent widths ( ew ) of hundreds of fe  i and fe  ii lines for every object . to this end",
    "we use daospec  a code which measures ews in an automatic manner ( pancino & stetson @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that the ews obtained with daospec are in good agreement with our previous hand - made measurements .",
    "the atmospheric parameters for program stars were obtained with the tgvit algorithm developed by takeda  in @xcite and updated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this purely spectroscopic method is based on analysis of iron lines and relies on three conditions resulting form assumption of lte that have to be satisfied : ( a ) the abundances derived from fe  i lines may not show any dependence on the lower excitation potential ( excitation equilibrium ) ; ( b ) the averaged abundances from fe  i and fe  ii lines must be equal ( ionization equilibrium ) ; ( c ) the abundances derived from fe  i lines may not show any dependence on the equivalent widths ( matching the curve of growth shape ) . in our case these three requirements are fulfilled .    the sample under consideration is composed of 22 red giants showing rv variations of 250 m s@xmath0 > rv > 40 m s@xmath0 ( possible planetary - mass companions hosts ) and a control sample of 58 giants with rv < 40 m s@xmath0 , presumably single stars .    for the sample of 80 stars we determined intrinsic stellar parameters using @xmath1100 fe  i and @xmath110 fe  ii lines from the lists presented in takeda  ( electronic table ) identified in the blue region of het / hrs spectra .",
    "lines stronger than 150 m at excitation potential less than 0.5 ev were rejected to avoid a disturbing of mean iron abundance trend relative to the excitation potential and ews .",
    "metallicity was estimated with a satisfactory accuracy of @xmath2[fe / h ] = 0.06 dex , on average , for all objects .",
    "we obtained the mean values of [ fe / h ] = -0.41 dex for the sample of stars exhibiting rv variations and [ fe / h ] = -0.26 dex for the rv - stable giants from the control sample ( or -0.25 dex if we take into account subgiants also ,  stars on fig .  1 with log(l / l@xmath3 )",
    "< 1.3 ) .",
    "these results show the tendency suggested by pasquini et al .",
    "( 2007 ) but exaggerated .",
    "giants demonstrating significant rv variations and thus suspected planet hosts are on average more metal - poor ( fig .  2 ) but the difference between the two samples is bigger than expected . as the difference in metallicity is much bigger that estimated metallicity uncertainty we conclude that the average metallicity of evolved stars with significant rv variations is 0.15 dex ( 2.5 @xmath2 ) lower than the mean value for the control sample of the rv - stable stars from our sample .",
    "the result is very preliminary .",
    "the future work ( in progress ) will extend the ews measurements to the red region of het / hrs spectra increasing the number of identified iron lines and thus will verify the metallicity determination .",
    "the nature of the rv variations of the 22 possible planetary hosts has to be studied in detail as well before we confirm the metallicity depletion in planet hosting giants .",
    "we thank y. takeda as well as p. stetson and e. pancino for making theirs codes available for us .",
