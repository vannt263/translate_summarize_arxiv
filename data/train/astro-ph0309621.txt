    "analysis of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation ( spergel et al . 2003 ) finds that the relative matter density @xmath2 is significantly larger than the relative baryon density @xmath3 .",
    "these results are consistent with the observed abundances of light elements and primordial nucleosynthesis ( see e.g. tytler et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ) and the power spectrum found from galaxy red - shift surveys ( percival et al .",
    "2001 ) , and indicate that the universe contains a significant amount of non - baryonic cold dark matter ( cdm ) .    weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps )",
    "are attractive cdm candidates , since a stable relic from the electroweak scale generically has an interesting present day density , @xmath4 ( dimopoulous 1990 ) .",
    "the argument goes as follows : annihilation processes cease and the wimp number density @xmath5 becomes fixed when the annihilation rate @xmath6 drops below the expansion rate @xmath7 ( usually referred to as chemical decoupling or freeze - out ) .",
    "the temperature of chemical decoupling is thus defined by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the annihilation cross section and @xmath10 the relative velocity of the annihilating particles . for a typical weakly interacting particle one",
    "finds @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the wimp mass . the present day relative wimp density can be estimated as @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the scale factor and we have set @xmath15 and assumed @xmath16 relativistic degrees of freedom at chemical decoupling . a cross section of about @xmath17  pb @xmath18 is typical for the annihilation of supersymmetric wimps since @xmath17 pb @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the electroweak coupling and supersymmetric particles typically have mass of order the electroweak scale ( @xmath21 gev ) .    in supersymmetry",
    "every standard model particle has an supersymmetric partner and in most models there is a conserved quantum number ( r - parity ) , which makes the lightest supersymmetric particle stable .",
    "supersymmetry models have a large number of free parameters , however in most models the lightest supersymmetric particle is the lightest neutralino ( which is a mix of the supersymmetric partners of the photon , the @xmath22 and the higgs bosons ; see e.g. jungman , kamionkowski & griest 1996 ) , furthermore in large regions of parameter space the lightest neutralino is mainly the bino ( roszkowski 1991 ) .",
    "accelerator searches place a lower limit on the neutralino mass of @xmath23 gev ( see e.g. hagiwara et al .",
    "2002 ) , while the wmap measurement of the matter density leads to an upper limit of @xmath24 gev ( ellis et al .",

    "hierarchically ; galaxy haloes form from the merger and accretion of subhaloes ( which themselves formed from smaller subhaloes ) .",
    "the internal structure of galaxy haloes is determined by the dynamical processes which act on the accreted components .",
    "dynamical friction causes subhaloes with mass @xmath25 to spiral toward the centre of a milky way mass parent halo within a hubble time , while the tidal field of the parent halo can strip material from a subhalo .",
    "numerically simulated galaxy haloes contain large numbers of subhaloes that have not been destroyed ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ) and the subhalo mass function varies roughly as @xmath26 down to the resolution limit of the simulations , @xmath27 ( stoehr et .",
    "al . 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore the anomalous flux ratios of multiply imaged qsos ( mao & schneider 1998 ; schechter 2003 ) may be due to millilensing by subhaloes , providing tentative observational support for the existence of substructure in galaxy haloes",
    ".    substructure on scales far smaller than those resolved by numerical simulations has potentially significant consequences for wimp direct ( drukier , freese & spergel 1986 ) and indirect ( see e.g. l. bergstrm 2000 ) detection . wimp direct detection ( using terrestrial detectors ) probes the dark matter distribution on sub - milli - pc scales ( silk & stebbins 1993 ; moore et al .",
    "2001 ; green 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "wimp indirect detection via wimp annihilation products ( gamma - rays , antiprotons and neutrinos ) is most sensitive to the highest density regions of the milky way ( e.g. silk & stebbins 1993 ; bergstrm et al .",
    "1999 , 2001 ; calcaneo - roldan & moore 2000 ) and clumping will also enhance the extra - galactic gamma - ray signal ( ullio et al .",

    "in this letter we present the matter power spectrum close to the end of the linear regime , for scales that enter the horizon well before matter - radiation equality .",
    "three effects are important : after chemical decoupling the primordial cdm density perturbations are collisionally damped , due to elastic interactions with other species , and then after kinetic decoupling free - streaming leads to further damping .",
    "cdm inhomogeneities on physical scales larger than the damping scale grow logarithmically during the radiation dominated epoch and then roughly proportional to the scale factor during the matter dominated epoch .",
    "the small scale cdm power spectra for the density , velocity and potential perturbations are an essential input for attempts to analytically estimate the size and mass of the very first gravitationally bound objects .",
    "ultimately , very high resolution cdm simulations will be necessary to make detailed predictions for the fate of the very first objects , however the very different characteristic smallest scales that have been predicted for different cdm candidates [ @xmath0 for neutralinos ( hofmann , schwarz & stcker 2001 ; schwarz , hofmann & stcker 2002 ; berezinsky , dokuchaev & eroshenko 2003 ) compared with @xmath28 for axions ( kolb & tkachev 1996 ) ] could have observable astrophysical consequences [ such as femtolensing and picolensing of gamma ray bursts ( gould 1992 ) ] . this would open up the exciting possibility of discriminating between cdm candidates astronomically .",
    "primordial cdm inhomogeneities on the smallest scales are smeared out by collisional damping and free streaming , if the cdm has once been in thermal contact with the hot component of the universe ( as is the case for wimps ) .",
    "these damping processes give rise to a sharp cut - off in the primordial cdm power spectrum . in order to make quantitative predictions",
    ", we assume the cdm particle to be a bino with mass @xmath12 .",
    "the bino abundance is fixed at chemical decoupling , which happens at typically @xmath29 , i.e.  above @xmath17 gev .",
    "below that temperature , elastic scattering of binos and fermions ( leptons and quarks from the radiation component ) can still occur and the bino decouples kinetically at significantly lower temperatures ( schmid , schwarz & widerin 1999 ) : @xmath30 mev to @xmath31 mev , depending on the parameters of the supersymmetric model .    between chemical and kinetic decoupling the cdm particles",
    "interact with the cosmic heat bath , which consists of all the relativistic particles in the universe , and this leads to collisional damping of the cdm density perturbations . since cdm is non - relativistic at this epoch , the dominant processes are bulk and shear viscosity .",
    "hofmann , schwarz & stcker ( 2001 ) calculated the effect of these processes on the primordial density perturbations and found exponential damping with a characteristic comoving wavenumber @xmath32 this corresponds to a length scale of @xmath33 at kinetic decoupling .",
    "the total cdm mass contained in a sphere with radius @xmath34 is @xmath35 .    for a bino ,",
    "the kinetic decoupling temperature depends on @xmath12 and on the various sfermion masses @xmath36 .",
    "here we make the simplifying assumption that all sfermions have the same mass , which is not correct in more realistic models , but is a reasonable assumption for a first estimate .",
    "we consider two fiducial sets of parameters : model a ( b ) has @xmath37 gev and @xmath38 gev . for these parameters",
    "we find , neglecting co - annihilations with other supersymmetric particles , that chemical decoupling happens at @xmath39 gev and @xmath40 , thus models a and b have cdm densities at the high and low end respectively of the range of values found by wmap . for these models",
    "kinetic decoupling occurs at @xmath41 mev and the damping mass scale is @xmath42 .",
    "after kinetic decoupling , the cdm particles enter the free streaming regime .",
    "we calculate the effect of free streaming by solving the collisionless boltzmann equation in fourier space on subhorizon scales , to first order in the perturbed thermodynamics quantities and neglecting metric perturbations , starting immediately after kinetic decoupling .",
    "we include the spectrum of cdm density perturbations at this time , and also take into account the matter and radiation components of the universe .",
    "the net result is again exponential damping with a characteristic scale which is inversely proportional to the ( time - dependent ) free - streaming length scale ( @xmath43 ) , multiplied by a polynomial term which arises from the ratio of the cdm particles kinetic energy to the thermal averaged kinetic energy .",
    "the free - streaming scale becomes approximately constant soon after matter - radiation equality ; @xmath44 the damping scale from free streaming depends on @xmath45 only via the logarithm , we therefore set it equal to wmap s best fit value , @xmath46 ( spergel et al .",
    "the corresponding length scale at matter - radiation equality @xmath47 and the total mass contained in a sphere with radius @xmath48 is @xmath49 .",
    "more precisely , for model a ( b ) we find @xmath50 .",
    "we can now put together all the damping factors for the cdm mass density perturbation @xmath51 .",
    "well after equality ( our approximations are valid for @xmath52 ) , when the comoving free streaming length is frozen , density inhomogeneities with large wavenumbers are suppressed by a damping factor @xmath53 { \\rm exp}\\left[-\\left({k\\over k_{\\rm fs}}\\right)^2- \\left({k\\over k_{\\rm d}}\\right)^2\\right].\\ ] ] the present approximation is valid for @xmath54 , as terms of order @xmath55 have been neglected in the polynomial .",
    "the mass density contrast as function of redshift and wavenumber can now be written @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the primordial density perturbation and @xmath58 is the transfer function which encodes the gravitational evolution of @xmath59 .",
    "following weinberg ( 2002 ) , we model the universe as a two component ( non - relativistic matter and radiation ) fluid . here",
    "we utilize the zero shear ( or longitudinal or conformal newtonian ) gauge .",
    "it is useful to define for each fluid ( the index ` a ' stands for radiation , @xmath60 , or non - relativistic matter , @xmath61 ) the energy density perturbation @xmath62 ( note that @xmath63 ) and the velocity perturbations @xmath64 by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the peculiar velocity .    the newtonian gravitational potential @xmath67 is defined via the metric , which is in the zero shear gauge given by @xmath68 in the absence of anisotropic stress , where cosmic time is denoted by @xmath69 .",
    "another useful quantity is the hypersurface independent quantity @xmath70 ( bardeen 1980 , 1989 ) , which is conserved on superhorizon scales .",
    "we use this definition to make contact with the wmap normalization , which is given in terms of @xmath71 ( verde et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "several comments are in order here .",
    "first , we work in the zero shear gauge , because all subhorizon quantities can be interpreted in terms of newtonian physics , which is not the case in the synchronous gauge , where the newtonian gravitational potential is gauged to zero .",
    "second , neutrinos are included in the radiation component in order to allow an analytic treatment , i.e.  their anisotropic stress is neglected .",
    "this leads to errors of around 10 % ( hu et al .",
    "furthermore we ignore the effect of a non - zero cosmological constant or curvature ( which only effect the evolution of the perturbations at very late times ) and baryon inhomogeneities . at early times the baryons",
    "are tightly coupled to the radiation fluid , and photon diffusion damping rapidly erases small - scale perturbations in the baryon fluid at @xmath72 to @xmath73 . on small scales",
    "the tight coupling breaks down prior to recombination , and the baryon perturbations grow , however @xmath74 still ( yamamoto , sugiyama and sato 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "post decoupling on scales @xmath75 the residual electrons allow transfer of energy between the photon and baryon fluids so that thermal pressure prevents the baryon perturbations from growing , until @xmath76 ( yamamoto , sugiyama and sato , 1997 ; padmanabhan , 2002 ) . as we are interested in cdm perturbations on small scales at early times",
    ", we can neglect the perturbations in the baryon fluid .",
    "the gravitational evolution of cdm inhomogeneities is described by the corresponding transfer functions . for the calculation of the transfer functions the equations of motion of the related perturbation variables have to be solved .",
    "unfortunately , this is not possible exactly for all times , however there are two overlapping regimes for which exact solutions exist .",
    "the first of these regimes is radiation domination , @xmath77 , for which an exact solution can be found that is valid for all scales ( schmid , schwarz & widerin 1999 ) . in the superhorizon limit ( @xmath78 ) ,",
    "@xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , while in the subhorizon limit ( @xmath83 ) with @xmath84 : @xmath85 \\ , , \\ v_{\\rm cdm}(x ) = - \\frac{3 \\sqrt{3 } \\phi_{0}}{x }    \\ , , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we see that on sub - horizon scales during radiation domination the matter perturbation @xmath87 grows logarithmically while @xmath88 oscillates with constant amplitude . thus for small scales which enter the horizon sufficiently long before matter - radiation equality the condition @xmath89 is satisfied during the radiation dominated era . as long as the cdm density perturbations @xmath90 dominate the density perturbations of the radiation and baryons ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath91 is governed by ( hu and sugiyama 1996 ) : @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the baryon fraction , with best fit value from wmap @xmath95 ( spergel et al .",
    "the exact solution to this equation is a combination of legendre functions of first and second kind , @xmath96 and @xmath97 with index @xmath98 .",
