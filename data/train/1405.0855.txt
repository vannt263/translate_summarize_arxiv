    "confining a hot ( millions k ) plasma in a magnetically controlled volume is not only the goal of the thermonuclear fusion reactors in terrestrial laboratories , but also is a reality near magnetic and relativistic compact objects in binary systems .",
    "it was realised quite some time ago that the strong magnetic fields of accreting white dwarfs and neutron stars disrupt accretion flows at some distance from their surfaces to form an accretion column ( or curtain ) around their magnetic poles @xcite .",
    "however , very little is currently known about the geometry of these columns or curtains .",
    "it is likely that the best currently available direct measurement of the size of an accretion column footprint on a white dwarf surface , was obtained several years ago via eclipse mapping of the polar fl cet @xcite .",
    "indirectly , the geometry of the accretion column / curtain can be estimated from the density of the hot plasma which is heated by a standing shock wave near the white dwarf ( wd ) surface .",
    "the density determines the cooling time of the plasma , thus knowing this cooling time and the total mass accretion rate in the flow we can have a handle on the accretion column / curtain geometry .",
    "@xcite showed that if the hot post shock region is cooling only via the bremsstrahlung emission it should be thermally unstable , generating quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) of the shock ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it was expected that such oscillations should be observable as optical brightness variations ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in later studies",
    "it was shown that there were mechanisms , like influence of cyclotron cooling , which can stabilize the post shock region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another possible mechanism which might make the post - shock region oscillations invisible in lightucrves is incoherent variations of different parts of the accretion column .",
    "if accretion flow is not uniform , but spreaded over a large number of quasi - independent filaments , their individual oscillations might be not in phase with each other .",
    "therefore even if the hot plasma cooling time scale is similar in these filaments , their total emission will be sum of incoherent brightness oscillations of individual filament and will be strongly dumped .",
    "more recently , it was proposed that in spite of the relative absence of qpos in mcvs , one can still probe the cooling time of the accretion column plasma via the properties of their aperiodic variability @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that aperiodic variability of the mass accretion rate in accretion columns , which , as we know from observations of accreting neutron stars , continues towards frequencies above 100 hz ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , should not produce strong variability in the luminosity at timescales smaller than the cooling time of plasma in the hot post - shock region .",
    "all variability at higher frequencies should be smeared out for periods less than this cooling timescale , producing a break in the power density spectrum of the brightness variations .",
    "the search for such a break was done in optical light of a bright northern hemisphere intermediate polar ( ip ) , ls peg @xcite .",
    "choosing to study mcvs in optical light has certain advantages .",
    "the main gain is in the relative increase in the number of optical photons generated by the wd / accretion disc , due to x - ray illumination from the post - shock region .",
    "depending on the geometry and inclination of the system , this number can far exceed that of x - ray photons reaching us directly from the post - shock region .",
    "unfortunately , due to the small level of aperiodic variations of light of ls peg at high frequencies ( @xmath6% at @xmath7 hz ) , only an upper limit ( @xmath8 sec ) on the cooling timescale was obtained .    in this paper",
    "we are furthering the search for the cooling time generated turnover frequency in the rapid variability of mcvs .",
    "our target is one of the brightest accreting magnetic white dwarfs in the southern hemisphere , ex hya .",
    "ex hya is one of the closest and brightest intermediate polars , which makes it one of the best candidates for searching for cooling time features in the power density spectra of optical flux variations in magnetic cvs .",
    "physical parameters of the system used in this study are listed in table [ pars ] .",
    "the mass accretion rate onto wd in this binary system demonstrates stochastic variability , which we see through variations of its x - ray and optical flux ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the accretion flow in this binary occurs via an accretion disk , disrupted at distance approximately @xmath9 cm @xcite . assuming that this disruption is due to influence of a dipole magnetic field of the white dwarf we can obtain an approximate estimate its magnetic field from a simple formula of magnetospheric radius of accreting compact object ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the magnetic moment of the compact object . substituting parameters from table [ pars ] we obtain @xmath12 g @xmath13 , which corresponds to magnetic field strength on wd surface @xmath14 kg .",
    "this value is in agreement with upper limit @xmath15 mg , inferred from spectroscopic observations of the system in infrared spectral band @xcite .",
    "such low magnetic field of the wd means that the cyclotron cooling mechanism is not important for the dynamics of the post shock region of the accretion column , that the dominant cooling is the optically thin plasma bremsstrahlung emission ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "observations were performed in slot mode , with 6x6 binning , providing 0.1 s time resolution @xcite .",
    "slot mode employs the following readout algorithm : a slot in front of the ccd leaves open only 144 unbinned rows ( approximately 20 arcsec on the sky ) of the ccd , just above the frame transfer boundary . during one exposure time",
    ", the signal is accumulated on the open part of the ccd . at the end of the exposure these 144 rows rapidly ( @xmath17 msec ) move over the frame transfer boundary .",

    "our reduction algorithm is similar to that of standard pysalt slottools package @xcite , but with some differences .",
    "photometric measurements of target and comparison stars were performed with fixed apertures around best fit centroids of the two stars , determined in each frame .",
    "we assume the background consists of a constant value and the vertical trail of the star , created by light from the star trailing during frame transfer from the image to the storage area of the ccd ( the shutter remains open in slot mode ) .",
    "typical selection regions are shown in fig.[sel_areas ] .",
    "the background value was measured as a median outside 3.75 arcsec aperture around stars and within 8.33 arcsec square , see fig.[sel_areas ] .",
    "our measurements show that the vertical trail contains about 4% of signal in 4.5 pixel star aperture , thus it should be carefully taken into account .",
    "we have adopted the following approach : we measured the mean shape of the trail profile over the areas , shown in fig.[sel_areas ] .",
    "this profile was extracted from each frame row .    as a first step of correction for the atmospheric influence",
    "we have divided the flux of the target star by the flux of a comparison star 2mass j12523138 - 2914023 ( differential photometry ) .        due to poor weather conditions , a substantial fraction ( approximately 50@xmath19 ) of our observations are not acceptable for the subsequent analysis .",
    "we have determined this from the light curve of the comparison star .",

    "the exposure time of our dataset filtered for the bad weather conditions is 1340 seconds .",
    "example of the source light curve is shown in fig.[lcurve ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that aperiodic variability of the source flux exists down to at least 1 s timescale .",
    "numerous gaps in salticam dataset ( typically every 6 seconds , are due to features in the readout sequence ) preclude usage of simple fourier transforms to obtain power spectrum of the source variability .",
    "thus we have obtained the power spectrum in two steps , at frequencies above 1/6 hz and at frequencies below 1/13 hz .",
    "seeing as the power spectrum at fourier frequencies above 1/6 hz has a steep slope of around -2 ( @xmath20 ) ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "part of the excess rotational energy ( which is not transferred to the rotational energy of the white dwarf ) should result in some additional heating of the innermost part of the accretion disc .",
    "this additional energy release can not heat the matter to x - ray temperatures , because eclipse mapping of ex hya showed that the x - ray emitting region in this system is confined to the wd surface ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , the effective temperature at the innermost edge of the disc should be less than @xmath92 2  3 ev ( @xmath93 k)@xcite .    adopting the other parameters of our binary",

    "therefore , we can anticipate that the overall structure of the compact object magnetosphere  accretion disk interaction in these two binaries should be similar and thus , the thickness of the accretion flow plasma / magnetosphere coupling region should be of the same order @xmath100 . in this case",

    "we have attempted to measure the smearing timescale with the help of fast timing observations of one of the brightest intermediate polars , ex hya , with optical telescopes at the south african astronomical observatory .",
    "the principle is based on the fact that a significant part of optical emission from ex hya originates as reprocessed x - rays in the post - shock region of the wd accretion curtains .",

    "however , the quality of the salt data shows that we can obtain good quality power spectra at high frequencies for estimating cooling timescales .",
    "our current findings can be summarized as follows :    * power spectrum of ex hya at fourier frequencies above 0.05 hz can be adequately described by a power law @xmath105 with a slope @xmath106 . * with the available data set we place an upper limit on the hot plasma cooling timescale on the order of @xmath107 seconds . *",
    "this hot plasma cooling time puts an upper limit on the area of the accretion curtain footprints on wd surface of ex hya , @xmath66 cm@xmath21 , and a lower limit on the mass flux of @xmath2 g sec@xmath3 @xmath4 . *",
    "our findings imply that the electron scattering ( compton ) optical depth of the hot post - shock plasma in the vertical direction might be close to , or more , than unity , which would lead to some distortions of the emergent energy spectrum and its angular distribution . *",
    "we deduce that the density of hot plasma in accretion curtains should be in the range @xmath108 @xmath13 .",
    "this range of densities can be probed with x - ray iron emission line diagnostics with future high energy resolution x - ray calorimeters .",
    "* we conclude that our estimate of the accretion curtain footprint area is significantly smaller than deduced from the eclipse mapping technique .",
    "this happens because eclipse mapping effectively determines the maximum geometrical sizes of curtains and thus their maximal possible areas within those size limits .",
    "* from the thickness of the accretion curtain at the wd surface , we determine that the extent of the coupling region at the boundary of wd magnetosphere in ex hya to be @xmath109 , which is in line with presently available theoretical and numerical estimates of this value . *",
    "if we assume that coupling region at the boundary of magnetosphere has a similar value @xmath109 in the case of accreting neutron stars , then we can estimate the fractional area of the neutron star accretion column @xmath110 .",
    "such a small fractional area of the column should result in very high mass flux and thus should have strong influence on the column structure .",
