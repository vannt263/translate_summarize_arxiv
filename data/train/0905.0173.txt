    "accelerated expansion of the universe seems not to be exceptional .",
    "theoretical and observational studies have revealed that the universe experienced the era of accelerated cosmic expansion at least twice ; an extreme inflationary acceleration in the early universe ( ea)tsujikawainflation and a late mild acceleration ( la)@xcite tsujikawade .",
    "we would like to figure out the basic physics behind these accelerations and reveal the inevitability , if any , of these accelerations . in the context of the einstein equation , we need special matter which is endowed with strong negative pressure in order to guarantee the accelerated cosmic expansion .",
    "however , it is often very difficult to find such matter in baryons , and therefore new fields such as the _ classical scalar field _ has been hypothesized though we have no fundamental understanding of it . probably reflecting this uncertainty ,",
    "this field has been named differently in various contexts in the literature such as higgs field , inflaton in ea , and k - essence , tachyon , quintessence , chaplygin gas , phantom field , ghosts , etc . in la .",
    "we do not want to be involved in these particular contexts but instead , we would like to reconsider how the degrees of freedom of such scalar field can arise within a firm physics even if we still can not fully identify this field .",
    "to this aim , we reconfirm the fact that the basic physics which describes the universe from the fundamental level is no doubt the quantum field theory",
    ". then how the classical dynamical degrees of freedom of scalar field can arise within this theory ?",
    "the most natural mechanism we can consider would be the _ bose - einstein condensation _",
    "( bec ) of some boson field@xcite .",
    "this condensation process is a phase transition and a typical mechanism that a classical degrees of freedom emerges as an order parameter within the quantum field theory @xcite .    along this line of thought",
    ", we have developed a cosmological scenario based on bec in order to explain la in the contemporary universe@xcite @xcite @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the dark energy ( de ) is identified with the bec of the bosons and the dark matter ( dm ) with the excited gas of the bosons .",
    "this cosmological situation is analogous to the liquid @xmath0 system in the laboratory in the sense that the two distinguished components , _ super and normal , coexist and interchange with each other_. our unified model of de and dm has been successful to describe the contemporary universe so far .    in this paper",
    ", we extend this bec cosmology to the early universe in order to examine how our bec cosmology reveal another acceleration ea .",
    "since we treat la and ea on an equal footing , we should not introduce any new ingredients into the previously developed bec cosmology except for the cosmological background .",
    "thus the goal of this paper is to examine to what extent this bec cosmology can be verified when applied to the early universe .",
    "we are especially interested in how the mechanisms of la and ea are different with each other in bec cosmology .",
    "we remember that la , described in bec cosmology , has been an attractor @xcite fukuyama07 which guarantees its autonomous realization .",
    "can we also expect ea be an autonomous mechanism in bec cosmology ?",
    "more precisely , when we analyze ea , we should clarify the _ autonomous initiation and termination processes of the inflationary era _ , which naturally turns into _ _",
    "the reheated _ _ radiation dominated era .",
    "actually , the bec makes the order parameter develop from zero to some finite value , and therefore the inflationary dynamics with finite duration would initiate autonomously if sufficient vacuum energy is provided by quantum fluctuations or something .",
    "we would verify this mechanism first .",
    "that is , we derive bec production rate from the microscopic lagrangian by using the generalized effective action in the in - in formalism .",
    "as for the termination of the inflationary era , it may seem to be impossible to control the ever increasing order parameter since our bec model assumes the negative quartic interaction ( attractive force ) without bound .",
    "however it is often seen in many physical phenomena that a violently unstable mode is taken over by an another stable mode via complex nonlinear processes . we will show that this is the case for bec cosmology .",
    "actually an extreme development of the order parameter completely prevents the violent cosmic expansion .",
    "we call this process as _ stagflation , _ where the order parameter ever inflates while the cosmic expansion becomes stagnant .",
    "thus the inflationary era terminates autonomously within a finite time scale .",
    "moreover , this extreme development of the ever accelerating order parameter easily gives rise to the particle production , which provides a natural process of the reheating .",
    "furthermore , the instability analysis reveals that the homogeneous mode immediately decays into the inhomogeneous localized modes at this stagflation era , when the cosmic expansion ceases .",
    "this stagflation era also provides a key mechanism to solve the _ cosmological constant problem_. the issue is to explain the dynamics of the cosmological constant @xmath1 , which had once been a huge value @xmath2 ev@xmath3 that makes ea , turns into a tiny but non - zero value about @xmath4 ev@xmath3 that makes la .",
    "though this initial huge value for @xmath1  would be naturally provided from ubiquitous vacuum energy , there should be a certain mechanism for the very fine tuning of @xmath1 to the vanishingly small but finite value at present . in the previous analysis of bec cosmology",
    "applied to la , we assumed that the zero - point of the potential energy is exactly zero , and shown that the vanishingly small but finite value of the effective @xmath1 term appears as a fixed point , in which the condensation speed and the potential force balance with each other . in this paper , we propose a new mechanism which autonomously adjust the effective @xmath1 term exactly zero .",
    "this would justify the above assumption for la .",
    "the essence of this @xmath1-extinction mechanism is the fact that _ the stagflation takes place exactly at the zero total energy_. as explained above , the uniform mode of bec becomes unstable at this stagflation point and suddenly decays into localized objects .",
    "thus after the inflation , the universe evolves into the stagflation point , where @xmath5 becomes zero and then the universe becomes dominated by the reheated radiation .",
    "we would like to quantitatively verify this mechanism in this paper .",
    "it will turn out that the @xmath1-extinction is asymptotically realized after many bec decays .",
    "the above instability of the uniform mode is the same as that appears in bec cosmology application in la .",
    "moreover , the condensation process of bec commonly triggers all the essential dynamics of the cosmic history in both the cases of ea and la .",
    "it is important to notice that these decay due to instability and the condensation of bec are not a coherent time change described by any lagrangian but are rather phase transitions and the incoherent evolution with dissipation and fluctuations .",
    "this point is further discussed in the following sections .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after applying the in - in formalism into bec formation ,",
    "we review the essence of bec cosmology applied in la in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we apply the bec cosmology to the early universe in the order of initiation , termination of inflation , reheating , cosmological constant problem , and generation of density fluctuations . in the last section 4 ,",
    "we summarize our study emphasizing the robust stagflation and clarifying unsolved problems at present .",
    "in this section , we first review our model of bec cosmology from the microscopic physics . various observations and theoretical analysis",
    "have revealed that the de and dm dominate the matter contents of the universe and de / dm ratio is of order unity at present@xcite .",
    "these facts may indicate some deep relation between de and dm .",
    "therefore it seems natural to construct a unified model of de and dm based on a single physical principle .",
    "the simplest thought will be to consider that both de and dm are actually the same dynamical matter but in different phases of existence .",
    "de phase should be almost uniformly distributed and is supposed to provide accelerated cosmic expansion . on the other hand , dm phase should be inhomogeneously distributed and is supposed to trace the structure of galaxies and clusters .    according to the einstein equation , the acceleration of the cosmic expansion requires isotropic negative pressure comparable to the energy density @xmath6  for de .",
    "this is because , in general relativity , pressure as well as energy density works as a source of gravity .",
    "such strong negative pressure sounds strange if we consider fermionic fields which constitute ordinary baryonic matter . on the other hand for bosons , familiar static magnetic field @xmath7 , for example",
    ",  shows such behavior @xmath8 in one spatial direction , reflecting that the magnetic force line has a positive tension",
    ". this negative pressure would be the origin of the variety of bursts and accelerations in solar physics such as flares and coronas .",
    "unfortunately this is a vector field and shows positive pressure in the other two spatial directions . a natural possibility to obtain",
    "the isotropic negative pressure is to consider the classical scalar field .",
    "this would be the standard line of thought in the modern cosmology as explained in the introduction .",
    "however , when we construct a unified model of de and dm , we further have to specify the origin of such scalar field in order to clarify the connection between de and dm .",
    "the problem is to find a phase which behaves as classical scalar field in the matter which is originally described by quantum physics .",
    "the most natural case would be the quantum condensation of bosons in low temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ the bose - einstein condensation .",
    "macroscopic number of boson particles share a single ground state in common and behaves as a coherent wave .",
    "this condensed phase is well described by a classical mean field . on the other hand the rest of the boson gas in excited states",
    "should macroscopically behaves as classical gas .",
    "therefore we naturally arrive at the thought that the boson gas is composed of two phases , condensed phase and gas phase , each of which can be regarded as de and dm , respectively . thus the bec cosmology arises .",
    "since the basic structure of the universe in this model is quantum physical and cosmological , we have a unique mass scale @xmath9ev  obtained by equating the present energy density @xmath10  to the energy density associated with mass @xmath11  and the compton wave length @xmath12 .",
    "this scale characterizes the cosmic bec .",
    "the above two - phase structure is quite common in physics in the sense that any special interactions among boson particles are not required for bec and it inevitably takes place provided the temperature is lower than the critical one .",
    "a well known such structure would be the liquid @xmath0 system in the laboratory .",
    "the super phase and normal phase correspond , respectively , to de and dm ; they coexist and interchange with each other .",
    "although the origin of the two - phase is quantum phase transition , the condensed phase is a classical mean field and should not be confused with the macroscopic quantum state , which is described by a wave function .",
    "the bec of boson mass @xmath11 takes place provided the de broglie wave length @xmath13 exceeds the mean separation @xmath14    @xmath15    this condition requires the boson gas to be cold , if we were to realize bec for reasonable boson mass appropriate for dm . actually in the universe , if the boson is the cold dark matter , irrespective of its interaction , its temperature ( or quasi - temperature ) behaves as the same as above @xmath16 in the cosmic expansion .",
    "therefore bec can always take place and continue provided the boson temperature was less than the critical temperature at some moment of cosmic evolution .",
    "the corresponding critical boson mass for bec can be arbitrary in general , but if we temporary assume that the boson was in equilibrium with the rest of the matter in the past , then the upper limit of the mass turns out to be about @xmath17ev fukuyama07 .    in the universe",
    "the ratio of de and dm can not simply be given by the standard expression for the ratio of condensation @xmath18 in equilibrium with the temperature @xmath19 the universe is actually almost adiabatic and therefore the transition toward the ground state is forbidden in the first approximation .",
    "however a small non - adiabaticity allows the very slow condensation .",
    "we need a firm formulation which describes this condensation process based on microscopic physics .",
    "the most appropriate , but not necessarily complete , method for this purpose would be the generalized effective action formalism @xcite , morikawa95 , @xcite , on which we now briefly explain .    the partition function , which describes all the fluctuations , is given by @xmath20\\equiv tr\\left [ \\tilde{t}\\left ( \\exp \\left [ i\\int_{c}{% \\tilde{j}\\tilde{\\phi}}\\right ] \\rho \\right ) \\right ] \\equiv \\exp \\left [ i% \\tilde{w}[\\tilde{j}]\\right ] , \\]]where the integration is taken over the entire space and the _ doubled time contour _ which extends from @xmath21 toward @xmath22 and then back to @xmath21 again .",
    "the symbol @xmath23 rearranges the operators on its right hand side in the order of this doubled time contour .",
    "all the quantities with overtilde represents that they are defined on this contour .",
    "@xmath24 is the external source field , @xmath25 is the initial density matrix , and the quantum field @xmath26 is in the heisenberg representation .",
    "this partition function can also be represented in the interaction picture as    @xmath27 & = & tr\\left [ \\tilde{t}\\left ( \\exp \\left [ i\\int \\tilde{j}% \\tilde{\\phi}-i\\int v\\left ( \\phi \\right ) \\right ] \\rho \\right ) \\right ] \\\\ & = & \\exp \\left [ \\tilde{t}\\int v\\left [ \\frac{\\delta } { i\\delta \\tilde{j}}\\right ] \\right ] \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{i}{2}\\iint \\tilde{j}\\left ( x\\right ) \\tilde{g}% _ { 0}\\left ( x , y\\right ) \\tilde{j}\\left ( y\\right ) \\right ] \\times \\\\ & & tr\\left",

    "it is useful to introduce a vector and matrix representation for the functions on the generalized time contour ; a field @xmath31 can be written as @xmath32 , where the quantity with suffix @xmath33 has its support only on the forward ( respectively , backward ) time contour .",
    "then @xmath31 can be represented as a vector @xmath34 .",
    "for example @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the following",
    ". then the notation @xmath39 means @xmath40 , where the subtraction on the right hand side represents the fact that the direction is opposite in the backward time contour .",
    "this can be conveniently expressed in the two - by - two matrix notation , @xmath41where @xmath421@xmath430@xmath440@xmath43 - 1@xmath45 and @xmath46 is the transpose .    the generalized two - point function @xmath47 is also expressed in this matrix notation as @xmath48the fact that the only three of them are independent is most clearly observed in their momentum representations , @xmath49where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are mutually independent functions .",
    "if we were to define the classical field as @xmath52 and define the legendre transform @xmath53\\equiv w[\\tilde{j}]-\\int { \\tilde{j}\\tilde{\\varphi}}$ ] * *  * * as the effective action as usual , then by definition , the equality holds @xmath54 , which may be regarded as the equation of motion for @xmath55 including all the quantum fluctuations .",
    "however , reflecting the fact that the effective action is not in general real @xmath56 , the above method makes the field @xmath55 unphysically complex .",
    "this ordinary procedure can not describe the phase transition dynamics .",
    "therefore we go beyond the standard method and decompose the effective action .",
    "we first notice that @xmath57 is even in the variable @xmath58 , @xmath59and the kernel @xmath60 is positive definite@xcite . therefore ,",
    "introducing an auxiliary real field @xmath61 we have the following path - integral expression . @xmath62}=\\int",
    "{ [ d\\xi ] } p[\\xi ] \\exp [ ire\\gamma + \\int i\\xi \\left ( x\\right ) \\varphi _ { \\delta } \\left ( x\\right ) dx]\\]]where the weight function is defined as @xmath63=n\\exp [ -\\frac{1}{2}\\int \\int { \\xi } \\left ( x\\right ) { b^{-1}}\\left ( x - y\\right ) { \\xi } \\left ( y\\right ) dxdy],\\]]where @xmath64 is the normalization factor .",
    "thus the field @xmath65 can be regarded as gaussian random field .",
    "inclusion of higher order terms in the above makes us possible to treat the non - gaussian properties as well . on the other hand ,",
    "the real part of the action @xmath66should be regarded as the standard action which describes dynamics . applying the variational principle for",
    "the variable @xmath67@xmath68we obtain the evolution equation for @xmath69 , which is simply denoted as @xmath70 hereafter , @xmath71where the source term @xmath72 is dropped .",
    "this is the langevin equation for the classical order parameter @xmath70 with classical random field @xmath73 .",
    "actually , if we define the statistical average by@xmath74} ... p[\\xi ] , \\]]then the correlation function for the auxiliary fields becomes @xmath75moreover , eq.([langevin ] ) is necessarily causal @xcite since the kernel @xmath76 has the property @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "thus the full effective action is now rewritten as the statistical superposition of dynamical effective action .",
    "note that the above dissipative nature arises as a result of an implicit and systematic coarse graining of the original full theory through the process of renormalization in the in - in formalism .",
    "this renormalization process is generally inevitable in quantum field theory to obtain finite physical quantities .",
    "the dissipative nature however can not arise in the ordinary vacuum as in the standard quantum field theory . for dissipation to arise , the system must be unstable or permit particle production or be immersed in the dissipative environment .",
    "the above langevin equation can , in principle , be transformed into the equivalent fokker - plank equation for the distribution function .",
    "this process is actually tractable if we can use the markovian property .",
    "the most of the application of the above formalism to the bec is given in @xcite .",
    "the langevin equation is transformed into the fokker - plank equation @xmath79 = -\\sum_{k}\\frac{% \\partial } { \\partial \\phi _ { k}}\\left ( \\left ( \\varepsilon ^{\\prime } -ir-\\mu \\right ) \\phi _ { k}p\\left [ \\phi ; t\\right ] \\right ) -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k}\\frac{% \\partial ^{2}}{\\partial \\phi _ { k}^{2}}\\left ( \\hbar \\sigma ^{k}p\\left [ \\phi ; t% \\right ] \\right ) , \\]]for the probability distribution function @xmath80 $ ] , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are , respectively ,",
    "renormalized energy and chemical potential which are related to the function @xmath83 , and @xmath84  @xmath85  are the transport coefficient functions which are related to the function @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this fokker - plank equation is further transformed into the rate equation for the energy density of the condensation @xmath88 in the limit of small condensation , i.e.  the back reaction of the condensation to the gas is negligible , the rate equation reduces to @xmath89where @xmath90 is the equilibrium value of the condensation and @xmath91 .",
    "the order estimate of the results in @xcite becomes , @xmath92if the dominant interaction is @xmath93 , and @xmath94if the dominant interaction is of type @xmath95 , where @xmath86 is the radiation field . in either case , the induced process is neglected in the rhs of eq.([rrateeq ] ) .",
    "it is most interesting that the detail of the form of @xmath96 is not relevant for the bec cosmology ( @xcite ) .",
    "any choice of @xmath96 ( or @xmath97 in the later argument ) yields qualitatively the same cosmology . in this flexible possibilities ,",
    "we adopt eq.([gammain4 ] ) in the following although eq.([gammain2 ] ) is equally applicable .",
    "the above results determine the bec condensation rate in the uniform boson gas .",
    "note that the above condensation rates are transport coefficients which can not be found directly in any lagrangian .",
    "this fact yields essential difference between our approach and the presently popular interacting de - dm scalar field models . for example @xcite",
    "@xcite study de - dm coupling as an interaction term in lagrangian .",
    "the recent reference @xcite study de - dm coupling phenomenologically by setting @xmath98 as a constant parameter .",
    "the quantity @xmath99  actually evolves in time in our model according to the equation of motion . in these aspects ,",
    "our bec model should be distinguished from general de - dm coupling models .",
    "so far we have considered the generation of bec . while this condensation proceeds , the uniform bec eventually becomes unstable due to the jeans instability and collapses into localized objects ( inhomogeneous dm ) leaving no uniform component .",
    "if the boson gas has attractive interaction , then this collapse would be further enhanced .",
    "thus in the universe , bec is generated and collapses .",
    "these dynamics can be regarded as generalized phase transitions which can not be described only by the coherent time change governed by a lagrangian .",
    "we now examine the detail of the bec phase transition in the following subsections .",
    "the gradual generation and subsequent decay of the spatially uniform bec can be summarized by the following set of equations in a compact form    @xmath100    where we assume a simple form of potential @xmath101 with attractive interaction @xmath102 .",
    "this potential form will be fully fixed if we can identify the boson field in the future .",
    "the einstein equation in the first line of eq.([eqsetforbeccosmology ] ) gives the cosmic expansion rate @xmath103 in terms of the energy densities of gas @xmath104 , bec @xmath105 , and the localized objects @xmath106 .",
    "the second line represents the evolution of the gas energy density @xmath104  which reduces due to the cosmic expansion @xmath107 and the consumption for bec @xmath108 the third line is the relativistic form of gross - pitaevski equation describing bec dynamics with the steady condensation rate @xmath109 , where @xmath110 ( for eq.([gammain2 ] ) ) or @xmath111 ( for eq.([gammain4 ] ) ) .",
    "this form of source and loss terms @xmath112 is the most characteristic to our bec model although they are small . in the same line of eq.([eqsetforbeccosmology ] ) , the term @xmath113  symbolically represents a sudden collapse of bec .",
    "the detail of this collapse will be explained in the next subsection .",
    "the last line represents the evolution of the localized energy density @xmath106  which reduces due to the cosmic expansion @xmath114 and increases due to the bec collapse @xmath115 .",
    "we now explain the bec instability and the collapse .",
    "uniform bec is not an absolutely stable phase if the interaction is attractive or gravity is concerned .",
    "it collapses into localized object after the appearance of instability .",
    "let us estimate the scale of bec instability , which determines the time scale of the bec collapse and the resultant mass scale of the localized objects .",
    "we start the space - time metric of the form@xmath116where @xmath117 represents the gravitational potential and @xmath118 the cosmic scale factor .",
    "bec is described by the equation of motion for the order parameter @xmath119 , i.e. the third line of eq.(eqsetforbeccosmology ) neglecting @xmath120 and @xmath121 since the instability time scale is very short compared with @xmath122 and @xmath123 . up to the first order in @xmath124 , this equation becomes @xmath125gravity",
    "is described by the poisson equation , in the einstein equation , @xmath126where @xmath127 is the uniform background energy density .",
    "we consider the linear perturbation on the uniform background    @xmath128    where small perturbations @xmath129 and @xmath130 are decomposed into fourier modes , @xmath131the background variables satisfy , from eqs.([eqn : scalar]-eqn : poisson ) , @xmath132 in these eqs.([eqn : scalar-0th]-[eqn : poisson-0th ] ) , the variable @xmath133 can be assumed to be real without generality since all the coefficients are real .",
    "then the existence of a non - trivial solution requires that the above set of linear equations are dependent with each other .",
    "thus we have the condition @xmath134   \\notag \\\\ & \\times & \\left ( \\omega ^{2}+3\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\omega + \\frac{\\mathbf{k}^{2}}{% a^{2}}+m^{2}+\\lambda \\phi _ { 0}^{2}\\right ) = 0\\ , ,   \\label{instability}\\end{aligned}\\]]which determines the instability strength @xmath135 as a function of the wave number @xmath136 the wave number @xmath137 which corresponds to the maximum value of @xmath135 ( _ i.e. _ most unstable mode ) is not necessarily the relevant scale since we also have to consider the completion time of the collapse @xmath138 , where @xmath139 @xmath140 is the decay speed of bec .",
    "thus the relevant scale will be the wave number @xmath141 which should satisfy the condition that the collapse time is just the instability time i.e. @xmath142 choosing the value associated with the most unstable mode among four solutions of @xmath135 , we have @xmath143where @xmath144 , @xmath145 and adiabatic approximation @xmath146  @xmath147",
    "is utilized since the collapse time scale is much smaller than cosmic and condensation time scales in the late universe .",
    "the actual scale critically depends on the boson mass@xcite .",
    "if it is about @xmath148ev , then the typical mass of the structure will be @xmath149 which is of order of a galaxy .",
    "if it is about @xmath150ev , then the typical scale in tiny @xmath151 and therefore bec collapse can not form macroscopic cosmological structures . in any case , these collapsed clumps would work as the ordinary dm and the scenario of large scale structure formation exactly reduces to the standard model .",
    "a typical numerical demonstration of uniform bec mode is given in fig.(fig1 ) .",
    "most of the characteristic features of bec cosmology are shown in this figure .",
    "the gas density @xmath104  ( grey line ) reduces monotonically while the bec density @xmath105  ( solid line ) gradually increases toward some instability point where it suddenly decays into localized objects @xmath106 ( dashed line )",
    ". then the bec density disappears and a new bec begins .",
    "this cycle repeats several times and finally the phase of @xmath152 appears .",
    "thus the universe inevitably enters into the final accelerated expansion phase .",
    "this phase is guaranteed by the stable balance of the condensation flow and the potential force , and is an attractor of eq.([eqsetforbeccosmology ] ) .",
    "several other features and predictions of this model are found in @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     bec cosmology seems to be able to describe the two accelerating stages of the universe in different ways , one is the early inflationary acceleration ( ea ) and the another is the contemporary mild acceleration ( la ) .",
    "the dynamics of the inflation is triggered by the bec condensation and the instability of bec around the stagflation point guarantees that the cosmological constant is vanishingly small irrespective of the initial vacuum energy .",
    "on the other hand , the contemporary mild acceleration inevitably takes place from the balance of the condensation speed and the potential force .",
    "its attractor nature guarantees the existence of the tiny cosmological constant presently observed .",
    "ea corresponds to the over - hill regime and la the mild - inflation regime in the general bec cosmologyfukuyama06 .",
    "these two acceleration regimes may be connected with each other by multiple collapses of bec , as suggested in figs.([fig5]-[fig7 ] ) . in this paper , we have demonstrated the post - sequence of bec collapse after inflation and the pre - sequence of it before the final acceleration .",
    "these two sequences may actually be connected to form a single sequence of bec collapse .",
    "unfortunately , the detailed analysis on this possibility and the mechanism of bec collapse itself go beyond the present paper .",
    "we will figure out the dynamics of bec probably by numerical technique and report them in the near future .",
    "novel properties of bec cosmology in this paper is realized by the phase transition of bec , which can not directly described by a unitary lagrangian dynamics .",
    "it will be important to notice that the universe may not be a mechanical machine whose time evolution is unitary , but be a whole sequence of phase transitions allowing the emergence of new structures in various stages .",
    "this paper is also a first proposal for the resolution of the cosmological constant problem based on the non - unitary phase transitions including non - uniform modes of condensation .",
    "we believe the most appropriate method to describe such incoherent evolution is the generalized effective action formalism @xcite on which we would like to report comprehensively in our future paper including various applications and verifications of bec cosmology .",
    "we sincerely appreciate fruitful discussions with eriko tanaka , osamu iguchi , takayoshi ohtsuka , and takayuki tatekawa ."

    "<S> we also show that the stagflation is quite robust and easily appears when one allows negative region of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> further , we comment on the possibility that bec generation / decay series might have continued all the time in the cosmic history from the inflation to present . </S>"
