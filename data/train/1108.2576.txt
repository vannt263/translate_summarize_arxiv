    "the ejection of two electrons caused by absorbtion of a single photon is one of the fundamental few - body processes in atomic physics .",
    "the process is called double photoionization or , less frequently , photo - double - ionization .",
    "the characteristic feature of this process is that it proceeds exclusively through the electron - electron interaction .",
    "because of this , double photoionization has long been used as a testing ground for understanding of the electron correlation phenomena .",
    "the traditional system for studying double photoionization is the helium atom , for which numerous experimental and theoretical investigations have been performed during the last four decades ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "most widely studied is the ratio of the double - to - single photoionization cross sections @xmath1 as a function of the energy of the incoming photon @xmath2 .",
    "early calculations of this ratio were mainly concentrated either at the near - threshold region of the photon energies ( @xmath3 79 ev for helium , with @xmath4 being the double ionization energy ) , where wannier theory is shown to be applicable @xcite , or at the asymptotical nonrelativistic region @xmath5 @xcite ( where @xmath6 is the electron mass ) .",
    "the intermediate region of the photon energies ( @xmath7 200  ev for helium , where @xmath8 reaches its maximum ) turned out to be much more difficult for an accurate theoretical treatment .",
    "reliable theoretical predictions in this region were obtained only in the end of 1990th by means of sophisticated many - body techniques ( notably , the close - coupling methods ) @xcite .    since the helium atom is an essentially nonrelativistic system , any relativistic effects in its double photoionization",
    "are considered to be of little importance at the present level of experimental precision . however , the recent experiments on the double @xmath9-shell photoionization of moderately heavy atoms up to silver @xcite demonstrated significant enhancements ( of about factor of five for silver ) of the cross section as compared with results of nonrelativistic calculations . a natural candidate for explaining",
    "this enhancement would be relativity , which obviously can not be disregarded when dealing with the deeply bound electron states in silver .",
    "because of the relative isolation of the @xmath9-shell electrons from the outer electrons , the double @xmath9-shell ionization of a heavy atom is often compared to the double photoionization of the corresponding helium - like ion .",
    "however , an accurate theoretical treatment of double @xmath9-shell ionization should include both the relativistic effects on the inner - shell electrons and the electron - correlation effects induced by the outer shells .",
    "such a calculation is rather difficult and has not been performed so far .",
    "in contrast to many - electron atoms , the helium - like ion is a relatively simple system for which an _ ab initio _ description is feasible .",
    "so far , there have not been any direct measurements of the double photoionization of helium - like ions .",
    "however , with the advent of new powerful light sources , such as the free - electron laser ( flash ) in hamburg , the linear coherent light source ( lcls ) at stanford , and the x - ray free electron laser ( xfel ) at hamburg , the experimental study of various photoabsorbtion processes is going to be possible for a great variety of ions in different charge states @xcite .",
    "measurements of the double photoionization in moderately heavy helium - like ions would allow us to effectively test our understanding of the _ relativistic _ electron - correlation effects .",
    "an alternative approach to the investigation of the double photoionization of highly charged ions is to study it in the inverse kinematics , through the radiative double electron capture .",
    "for bare oxygen , such measurement was recently accomplished in ref .",
    "the experimental upper bound on this process for bare uranium was reported in ref .",

    "to the given order of perturbation theory , the treatment is _ exact _ , i.e. , includes all multipoles of the absorbed photon , the retardation in the electron - electron interaction as well as the interaction of the electrons with the nucleus without any expansion in the binding field .",
    "the treatment is gauge invariant , both with respect to the gauge used for the absorbed photon and the gauge of the electron - electron interaction .",

    "<S> a fully relativistic calculation of the double photoionization of helium - like atoms is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is based on the partial - wave representation of the dirac continuum states and accounts for the retardation in the electron - electron interaction as well as the higher - order multipoles of the absorbed photon . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - electron interaction is taken into account to the leading order of perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic effects are shown to become prominent already for the medium-@xmath0 ions , changing the shape and the asymptotic behaviour of the photon energy dependence of the ratio of the double - to - single photoionization cross section . </S>"
