    "the formation of a stellar cusp of stars near massive black holes ( mbhs ) was first discussed by @xcite , who argued that a maxwellian distribution is not feasible because stars would be destroyed at unphysical high rates close to the mbh .",

    "the bahcall & wolf profile of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the density at radius @xmath8 , has since been confirmed in many theoretical papers with different methods , including fokker - planck ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite considered the evolution of stellar systems with several masses ( denoted with @xmath10 ) and showed that again the resulting steady state distribution functions @xmath11 are approximate power laws , with the more massive stars having steeper slopes .",
    "they found that the stellar current into the mbh , @xmath12 , is very small (  zero - flow solution \" ) which leads to a specific relation between the stellar mass and the logarithmic slope of the df refer to either the light or the heavy component of a two - mass system .",
    "] , @xmath13 . in the keplerian limit near the mbh , these dfs correspond to power - law density cusps , @xmath14 with @xmath15 . in their analysis , they considered quite moderate number and mass - ratios , and concluded that the stars with the lowest masses have slopes @xmath16 , whereas the stars with the highest masses have slopes @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast to their work on single mass - systems , for several decades surprisingly few studies pursued the dynamics of multi - mass systems .",
    "@xcite performed a fokker - planck study with a mass - spectrum , in addition to other physical processes such as stellar collisions , tidal disruptions and stellar evolution .",
    "more recently , motivated by observations of the stellar population surrounding the mbh in galactic centre ( gc ) , there have been several studies of mass - segregation near mbhs .",
    "the first applications to the gc were by @xcite , who used hnon - type monte carlo simulations .",
    "these simulations broadly confirmed the results by @xcite , and showed that cusps should indeed form near the mbh in our own gc .",
    "the planning of the _ laser interferometer space antenna _",
    "( lisa ) formed another motivation for the study of mass - segregation near mbhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the reason for this is as follows . when compact stellar remnants spiral into mbhs of @xmath18 , they emit gravitational waves with frequencies and power such that lisa should be able to observe them out to redshifts @xmath19 .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that stars can only spiral in successfully if they start very close ( @xmath20 ) to the mbh , for otherwise they are scattered away from their inspiral orbit .",
    "the implication is that inspiral rates are very sensitive to the details of the stellar distribution very close to the mbh , which is in turn dependent on the amount of mass segregation in the cusp . as a result",
    ", inspiral rates of stellar black holes ( bhs ) may be higher than those of white dwarfs ( wds ) @xcite : even though for typical initial mass functions there are many more wds than bhs in an evolved stellar population , mass - segregation drives the bhs to such orbits where they can spiral in , such that within @xmath21 there may in fact be more bhs than wds .",
    "in addition to inspiral stars , lisa may also observe gravitational wave bursts from stars during a single fly - by in our _ own _ gc @xcite .",
    "these stars are usually on very short period ( @xmath22 ) orbits , and mass - segregation makes it again more likely to observe bursts from bhs than from other stars @xcite .",
    "the interest in mass segregation near mbhs , driven by observation , has also led to new theoretical developments .",
    "@xcite extended the analysis by @xcite to a much larger parameter space , and showed that the study by @xcite happened to be at a corner of this space where the behaviour is very stable , but that for systems where the massive stars are less numerous the evolution is very different ; see  [ s : duo ] and figure ( [ f : delta ] ) .",
    "more specifically , they found that the most massive stars can have power law slopes that are steeper than @xmath23 , which was ruled out by @xcite .",
    "this kind of  strong mass segregation \" was confirmed in @xmath9-body simulations by @xcite .",
    "an analytical study of mass segregation with _ continuous _ mass functions was performed by @xcite , who showed that , in the maximally steep limit , heavy stars can develop a cusp as steep as @xmath24 .    in this work",
    "we revisit the evolution of a cusp from a duo - mass stellar population which undergoes mass segregation @xcite , determine the time scale for arriving at a steady state distribution , and discuss the results in terms of the gc .",
    "@xcite use fokker - planck simulations to find the the approximate steady state distribution functions ( dfs ) of a non - evolving spherically - distributed duo - mass stellar population around a fixed mbh .",
    "mass is measured in units of the mass of a reference star @xmath25 , specific energy in units of its velocity dispersion @xmath26 , and time in units of its two - body relaxation time at the radius of influence , @xmath27 where the coulomb term is estimated as @xmath28 .",

    "this parameter describes the competition between the self - coupling of the heavy stars and the light - heavy coupling in terms of the mass and number ratios , @xmath47 we reproduce some results of their simulations in figure ( [ f : delta ] ) which shows the local logarithmic slopes of the dfs , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , at @xmath50 ( which corresponds to orbits with a semi major axis of @xmath51pc for @xmath52 pc in the gc ) as a function of @xmath46 . for comparison , they take the same mass ratios as modeled by bw77 , @xmath53 .",

    "+ the present - day mass function of evolved stellar populations ( coeval or continuously star forming ) with a universal initial mass function , separates into two distinct mass scales , @xmath70 of main sequence stars , dwarfs and neutron stars , and @xmath71 of bhs . in this sense",
    "such systems can be approximated by a duo - mass system .",
    "furthermore , @xcite show that @xmath72 so that this system should be strongly mass segregated . in the next section we calculate the time scale for such a system to form a mass segregated steady state cusp .",
    "the amount of time it takes to form a stellar cusp around a mbh in a galactic nucleus is important for many reasons including , but not limited to , event rates of stellar collisions , tidal disruptions of stars and inspirals of compact objects with the emission of gravitational waves . in particular , if this time is greater than a hubble time , event rates will be lower than previously predicted . to determine this time scale we use fokker - planck simulations as described in ",

    "values of the relaxation time for mbhs with @xmath78 vary in the literature , but are generally constrained to within @xmath79 .",
    "our results imply that quasi - steady , mass segregated stellar cusps should be common around mbhs in galactic nuclei for this mass regime . hence , assuming gc parameters that we observe today ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a cusp should form within @xmath80     with increasing thickness for increasing time .",
    "steady state is reached in about @xmath81 .",
    "initially , all dfs were @xmath82 .",
    "interestingly , for short times the distribution of white dwarfs ( wd ) , main sequence stars ( ms ) and neutron stars ( ns ) grows steeper than the final distribution which is approximately energy independent .",
    "the reason is that it takes time for the stellar black holes ( bh ) to grow a steep cusp and become the dominant species .",
    "[ f : ss],height=120 ]",
    "several studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that indeed a cusp of stars is present in the gc .",
    "however , recently it has become clear that even though the _ young _ stars do have a power law profile , there is a dearth of giant stars within @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "since the o / b stars are too young to have relaxed by the two - body relaxation process discussed here , the conclusion is that currently there is no observational support for cusp formation or mass - segregation in the gc .",
    "the reason for the absence of a cusp is unclear .",
    "one possibility is that physics not considered here depletes the tightly bound orbits of old stars , for example as a result of stellar collisions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another option was considered by @xcite , who suggested that relaxational physics _ does _ in fact capture the main mechanism for cusp formation , but that the age of the gc is too short compared to the time scale for a cusp to have formed today .",
    "his estimate of the relaxation time is @xmath84 , and in his fokker - planck simulations , @xcite does not find the formation of a relaxed cusp within that time .",
    "this is in contrast to the result we found in ",
    "[ s : time ] , where a cusp forms in @xmath85 , similar to the findings by @xcite .",
    "thus , even for a relaxation time of @xmath86 gyr , the central pc would form a cusp in less than a hubble time , _ starting from the current situation_. the reason for this discrepancy in the time scale for reaching a steady state solution is not yet clear , but may be related to the back reaction of the bhs on the light main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "we note that our findings do not imply that the gc is necessarily relaxed and formed a cusp : it is possible that in the past the density at the radius of influence was lower , that it has taken a hubble time to contract to the current configuration , and that the remaining time to form a cusp is less than a hubble time @xcite",
    ". however , this argument appears to be more attractive when the remaining time for cusp formation exceeds a hubble time .",
    "relaxational dynamics can not account for the presence of a cluster of b - stars known as thes - stars \" in the inner @xmath87 near the mbh in the gc @xcite , since the time scales are too long for young stars ( with ages between @xmath88 myr ) to diffuse to such distances .",
    "there have been many suggestions of how the s - stars have reached their current orbits .",
    "currently the most promising scenarios seem to be those where a binary star is tidally disrupted by the mbh @xcite .",
    "such binaries may originate very far from the mbh , where they are perhaps driven to eccentric orbits by triaxiality or massive perturbers @xcite .",
    "alternatively , binaries which form in eccentric accretion discs can be pumped to very high eccentricities by a gravitational instability @xcite . in either case",
    ", a b - star may end up on a tightly bound orbit , but the orbit will be very eccentric ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "post - capture dynamics must then account for the mapping of the initial , very high eccentricity distribution to the current distribution in the gc .",
    "the mechanism responsible for changing the eccentricities is most likely resonant relaxation ( rr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a secular process that very efficiently randomizes the angular momenta of orbits if the precession time is much longer than the orbital time - scale .",
    "for the s - stars , the resonant relaxation time is of order @xmath90 where @xmath25 is the typical mass of stars . for @xmath91 , appropriate for mass segregated bhs , this time - scale is short enough to randomize the orbits @xcite .",
    "post - capture evolution was studied in detail by @xcite with the use of @xmath9-body simulations .",
    "these simulations do not include general relativistic precession , which is potentially important for the highly eccentric orbits that are considered here , but they clearly show that the distribution evolves on time - scales of the order @xmath92 . for @xmath93",
    "however , this time scale is too large for the s - star orbits to have evolved from high eccentricities to their currently observed orbits .",
    "only if there are mass - segregated bhs within the s - star radii can rr explain their orbital parameters .",
    "as stated in the introduction , most compact remnants that spiral in successfully onto mbhs to become detectable gravitational wave sources originate from distances very close ( @xmath20 ) to the mbh .",
    "it is therefore important to what extent such orbits are populated , and mass - segregation helps to increase this number . in spite of this , even if there is no cusp in the gc , this would not necessarily imply that other , similar galaxies do not have cusps either .",
    "if , as we find , the time for cusp formation from the current state is less than a hubble time , then one would expect that most galaxies with mbhs similar to the gc did in fact form cusps , even if our galaxy did not .",
    "furthermore , most inspiral sources originate from lower mass mbhs @xcite ; such galaxies have even shorter relaxation times , and are thus more likely to have formed cusps .",
    "the predicted number of detectable lisa sources will therefore not depend strongly on the question of whether a cusp is present or not in the gc .",
    "conclusions regarding the absence of a gravitational wave background from fly - bys @xcite will likewise not be strongly affected ."
