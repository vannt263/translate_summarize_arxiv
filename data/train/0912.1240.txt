    "the search for planets has been an important driver for observers in the two last decades .",
    "their detection and characterization contribute to developing our understanding of their structure , formation and evolution . in the close ( @xmath0  au ) environment of stars , the radial velocity , transit , micro - lensing , pulsar - timing observing techniques are so far best suited .",
    "the radial velocity ( rv ) and transit techniques are nowadays the most successful methods for detecting and characterizing the properties of exo - planetary systems .",
    "the rv surveys have focused on main sequence solar - type stars , with numerous narrow optical lines and low activity , to ensure high rv precision .",
    "recently , planet - search programs have been extended to lower and higher mass stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) and younger and more evolved systems ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since the discovery of 51 pegb ( @xcite ) , more than 300 exo - planets have been identified featuring a broad range of physical ( mass ) and orbital ( p , @xmath1 ) characteristics ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this technique also revealed the existence of the so - called brown dwarf desert at small ( @xmath0  au ) separations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the bimodal aspect of the secondary mass distribution indicates different formation mechanisms for two populations of substellar companions , brown dwarfs and planets .",
    "the transit technique coupled with rv enables determination of the radius and density of giant planets and thus a probe of their internal structure . moreover ,",
    "spectral elements of a planetary atmosphere can be revealed during primary or secondary eclipse ( @xcite , @xcite ) . to extend such systematic characterization at larger scales ( @xmath2  au )",
    ", the deep imaging technique is particularly well suited to probe the existence of planets and brown dwarf companions and complete our view of planetary formation and evolution . to access small angular separations , the space telescope ( hst ) or the combination of adaptive optics ( ao ) system with very large ground - based telescopes (",
    "palomar , cfht , keck , gemini , subaru , vlt ) have become mandatory .",
    "we present here the results of the 3 main planet search survey conducted at the grenoble institute of astrophysics ( laog ) since 2002 .",
    "we have conducted a deep coronographic ao imaging survey of 26 stars with planets detected through radial velocity measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "the domain investigated typically ranges between @xmath3 to @xmath4 ( i.e. about 3 to 500  au , according to the mean distance of the sample ) .",
    "the survey is sensitive to stellar and substellar companions with masses greater than @xmath5 ( 0.5  gyr ) with cfht and @xmath6 ( 0.5  gyr ) with vlt , at @xmath7 ( @xmath8  au ) from the primary star . among the 20 stars that were found to have potential companions ( candidate companions , hereafter ccs ) , we could identify ( through proper motion measurements ) and then monitor 3 bound companions to three stars : 1 )",

    "this is the third white dwarf discovered sofar around a star hosting planets , in addition to gl86b and hd147513b ( @xcite ) . in both cases , the rv drift induced by these companions",
    "are below the limits of current rv studies .",
    "this illustrates the complementarity between direct imaging and rv studies . finally , we also found a 0.55 m@xmath9 star ( assuming an age of 0.5 gyr ) orbiting hd196885",
    "this latter case brings to 5 the number of stars hosting planets and members of close in ( @xmath10 20 au ) multiple systems . combining ao and rv data",

    "we additionaly traced back the evolutive and dynamical history of gl86b , which was originally a g dwarf on a close ( @xmath15 au ; ) and less eccentric orbit .",

    "the dusty star survey was focused on probring the presence of planets around about 15 stars with known debris disks ",
    "disks containing dust which is not primordial but produced by collisions among larger rocky bodies .",
    "in the course of this survey , a companion candidate was detected around @xmath16  pic , a a5v star at a distance of @xmath17  pc ( @xcite ) , which remains the best studied young ( @xmath18  myr ; @xcite ) system , with an impressive amount of indirect signs pointing toward the presence of planets .",

    "@xcite presented intriguing light variations possibly due to disk inhomogeneities produced by a jupiter size planet at @xmath20  au .",

    "the structure is well reproduced by the deformation induced on colliding planetesimals by a giant planet on a slightly inclined orbit within 50  au  from the star ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "using deep adaptive - optics @xmath22-band images , a faint point - like signal is detected at a projected distance of @xmath23  au  from the star , within the north - east side of the dust disk ( see fig .  2 ) .",

    "faint ccs were detected around 36 stars observed in coronagraphy .",
    "follow - up observations with vlt or hst for 30 stars enabled us to identify their status .",
    "1% of the ccs detected have been confirmed as comoving companions , 43% have been identified as probable background contaminants and about 56% need further follow - up observations .",
    "the remaining ccs come mostly from the presence of crowded fields in the background of the 6 stars observed at one epoch .",
    "we confirmed previously discovered substellar companions around gsc08047 - 00232 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , abpic ( @xcite ) and 2m1207 ( @xcite , @xcite ) and placed them in the perspective of confirmed substellar companions among young , nearby associations ( see fig .",
