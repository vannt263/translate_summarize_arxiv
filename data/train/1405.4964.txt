    "in this contribution , we want to review work concerning the structure of local renormalizable quantum field theories . our emphasis will be to exhibit the most recent developments by way of example , and in particular to stress that at the time of writing we witness two simultaneous developments : a better understanding of the algebro - geometric underpinning of field theory in four dimensions of space time , and also as a consequence the emergence of computational approaches which surpass the hitherto established state of the art .",
    "foremost , i want to thank david broadhurst , with whom my interest in the periods emerging in qft started some twenty years ago @xcite .",
    "spencer bloch helped to uncover the mathematics behind it , as did francis brown , christian bogner , alain connes , dzmitry doryn , hlne esnault , erik panzer , oliver schnetz , and others .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank james drummond for hospitality at cern , geneva , feb 24-march 01 2013 , as well as the ihes , where parts of this paper were written .",
    "it is the purpose of this section to completely analyse an example .",
    "we choose wheels with three or four spokes , inserted at most once into each other .",
    "results for them are available by methods which were recently developed @xcite and which are presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we consider the free commutative @xmath0-algebra generated by a sole generator in degree zero , @xmath1 , which serves as a unit for the algebra . in degree three",
    "we put @xmath2 whilst the only generator in degree four is @xmath3 in degree six we have @xmath4 and @xmath5 whilst in degree seven we have @xmath6 and @xmath7 note that @xmath8 are the only two different topologies we can obtain by replacing one of the five vertices of @xmath9 by @xmath10 .",
    "the four vertices of @xmath9 which are connected to an external momentum all give @xmath11 ( modulo permutations of edge labels ) , whilst inserting at the internal vertex of @xmath9 gives @xmath12 .",
    "finally , in degree eight we only consider @xmath13 and insertion at the internal vertex : @xmath14 at higher degrees , we only allow products of the generators listed so far .",
    "we make this into a bi - algebra by setting @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we get a hopf algebra by setting @xmath24 , and recursively @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the projection onto elements of positive degree , i.e.  the augmentation ideal .",
    "define two maps into the augmentation ideal @xmath27 by @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 , else .",
    "then @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 which ensures that these maps behave as hochschild one - cocycles in the examples below .",
    "effectively , we are working in a hopf algebra of graphs generated and co - generated by @xmath10 and @xmath9 , a quotient of the full hopf algebra of graphs .",
    "note that , for example , @xmath35 this is a consequence of restricting to a finite hopf algebra .",
    "it poses no problems for our applications below in this finite hopf algebra .",
    "now , let @xmath36 be algebra maps , and let @xmath37 be defined by @xmath38 then @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "were the @xmath42 to provide hochschild one - cocycles , the @xmath43 would provide co - boundaries .",
    "we choose wheels in wheels as an example as results for them are on the brink of computability at the moment .",
    "the methods of francis brown @xcite combined with @xcite allow to compute the period provided by @xmath44 @xcite , whilst the periods from a symmetric combination of graphs @xmath45 as defined below are realistically in reach by this approch -and this approach only , it seems- , and the eight - loop @xmath46 period remains a challenge .",
    "note that there is an obvious co - radical filtration and associated grading here , given by the kernels of @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , i.e.  using projections into the augmentation ideal combined with the co - product ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we find in grading one the primitives @xmath49 and , more interestingly , the primitive elements @xmath50 and in particular @xmath51 which also defines the co - symmetric @xmath45 and @xmath52 they are all linear combinations of elements in filtration two which combine to give primitive elements in the hopf algebra , hence of co - radical degree 1 . note that @xmath45 is a co - symmetric element ( of co - radical degree two ) in the hopf algebra , which is the reason why we can subtract the commutative product @xmath53 to obtain a primitive element .",
    "let us also define a co - antisymmetric element in degree two , @xmath54    then , its reduced co - product @xmath55 delivers @xmath56 an element which indeed changes sign when we swap the elements on the lhs and rhs of the tensor product , contrary to @xmath57      let us now consider the lie algebra @xmath58 with generators @xmath59 which are kronecker - dual to the hopf algebra generators @xmath60 .",
    "its bracket is determined by @xmath61,h\\rangle,\\,h\\in h.\\ ] ] here , @xmath62 is the kronecker pairing between elements @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and @xmath65 range over the set of subscripts @xmath66 used to denote the graphs .",
    "consider also the corresponding universal enveloping algebra @xmath67 here , @xmath68 denotes the symmetrized tensor - product , and @xmath69 can be identified , albeit non - canonically , with the symmetric tensor algebra of @xmath58 .",
    "the lie algebra @xmath58 itself has a ( descending ) lower central series decomposition : @xmath70,\\ , k>1.\\ ] ]    the co - product of an element in @xmath71 is not co - commutative .",
    "it pays to decompose images of @xmath72 and its iterations into symmetric and antisymmetric parts .",
    "the idea on which we elaborate in the following is to map elements in the hopf algebra to elements in the above universal enveloping algebra of its dual lie algebra , taking some extra information from physics : we will soon see that feynman rules assign to hopf algebra elements polynomials in a variable @xmath73 , bounded by the co - radical degree , which respects a decomposition into co - symmetric and co - antisymmetric terms in the hopf algebra which is particularly illuminating in comparison with the universal enveloping algebra .",
    "concretely , let us consider the following map ( extended by linearity ) @xmath74 .",
    "we start with primitive elements @xmath75 , which , as we will see , all evaluate under the feynman rules to terms linear in @xmath73 : @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 note that under @xmath80 these primitives have images @xmath81 , but @xmath82 .",
    "let us now consider non - primitive elements .",
    "as we will see under the feynman rules , the next two examples give polynomials quadratic in @xmath73 .",
    "this is reflected in @xmath80 :    @xmath83 @xmath84 note that the second symmetric tensor power shows up here , reflecting the @xmath85 term in the feynman rules .",
    "finally , we have the co - antisymmetric element .",
    "it is of co - radical degree two , but is linear in @xmath73 under the feynman rules .",
    "we map @xmath86\\in \\mathcal{l}_2,\\;[z_3,z_4]\\not\\in\\mathcal{l}_3,\\ ] ] with @xmath87=\\frac{1}{2 } z_{34a}+\\frac{1}{2}z_{34b}-z_{43}.\\ ] ] note that the second symmetric tensor power does not show up here due to the co - antisymmetry of @xmath88 .",
    "nicely , the feynman rules play along .",
    "all others evaluations of @xmath80 follow by linearity .",
    "the fact that the dynkin operator @xmath89 , -with @xmath90 the grading operator multiplying a hopf algebra element of co - radical degree @xmath91 by @xmath91- , of @xmath71 vanishes on products very much suggests to construct @xmath80 as above .",
    "the fact that it maps pre - images @xmath92 of co - symmetric elements in @xmath93 to primitive elements of @xmath71 motivates to look at the lower central series of @xmath58 for the co - antisymmetric elements . also , note that pre - images of co - symmetric elements can be generated from @xmath1 through shuffles of one - cocycles , for example @xmath94 .",
    "we now give the feynman rules for hopf algebra elements , next study them in examples provided by our small hopf algebra , and discuss the induced feynman rules on the lie side at the end .",
    "feynman rules on the hopf algebra side are provided for scalar fields from the two symanzik polynomials , together with the above hopf algebra structure . for gauge fields ,",
    "a third polynomial @xcite allows to obtain the feynman rules for gauge theory from the scalar field rules @xcite .",
    "we follow @xcite .      for the first kirchhoff polynomial consider the short exact sequence @xmath96 here ,",
    "@xmath97 is provided by a chosen basis for the independent loops of a graph @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath99 is the number of edges and @xmath100 the number of vertices , so @xmath101 is an @xmath102-dimensional @xmath0-vectorspace generated by the edges , similar @xmath103 for the vertices with a side constraint setting the sum of all vertices to zero .",
    "consider the matrix ( see @xcite ) @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "define the _ first kirchhoff polynomial _ as the determinant @xmath106    ( @xcite , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prop.2.2 ) ) the first kirchhoff polynomial can be written as @xmath107 where the sum on the right is over spanning trees @xmath108 of @xmath98 .",
    "to each edge @xmath111 we assign an auxiliary four - vector @xmath112 .",
    "let then @xmath113 , @xmath114 be the three pauli matrices , and @xmath115 the unit matrix .",
    "for the second kirchhoff polynomial , augment the matrix @xmath116 to a new matrix @xmath117 in the following way :    1 .   assign to each edge",
    "@xmath111 a quaternion @xmath118 so that @xmath119 , and to the loop @xmath120 , the quaternion @xmath121 + 2 .",
    "consider the column vector @xmath122 and the conjugated transposed row vector @xmath123 .",
    "augment @xmath124 as the rightmost column vector to @xmath125 , and @xmath123 as the bottom row vector .",
    "3 .   add a new diagonal entry at the bottom right @xmath126 .",
    "note that by momentum conservation , to each vertex , we assign a momentum @xmath127 , and a corresponding quaternion @xmath128 .",
    "note that we use that we work in four dimensions of space - time , by rewriting the momentum four - vectors in a quaternionic basis .",
    "this strictly four - dimensional approach can be extended to twistors @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath117 has a well - defined pfaffian determinant ( see @xcite ) with a remarkable form obtained for generic @xmath112 and hence generic @xmath127 :    ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq.3.12))[gensym ] @xmath129 where @xmath130 is @xmath131 if @xmath111 is oriented from @xmath132 to @xmath133 and @xmath134 else .    here",
    ", @xmath135 are two trees such that their union contains all vertices of the graph , i.e.  @xmath136 is a spanning 2-tree .",
    "note that @xmath137 is a function of all @xmath127 , @xmath138}$ ] . from the view - point of graph theory , this is the natural polynomial .",
    "it gives the second symanzik polynomial upon setting the @xmath112 in accordance with the external momenta @xmath139 : @xmath140    adding to the second symanzik polynomial a term @xmath141 allows to treat masses @xmath142 .",
    "for @xmath143 a non - trivial subgraph , and @xmath144 we have almost factorization : @xmath145 , with the remainders @xmath146 homogeneous polynomials of higher degree in the sub - graph variables than @xmath147 .      in schwinger parametric form , the unrenormalized feynman amplitude @xmath148 ( omitting trivial overall factors of powers of @xmath149 and such ) comes from an integrand @xmath150 @xmath151 this form gets modified if we allow for spin and other such complications .",
    "an exhaustive study of how to obtain gauge theory amplitudes from such an integrand is given in @xcite .",
    "a regularized integrand can be obtained by raising the denominator @xmath152 to a noninteger power ( dimensional regularization ) , or multiplication by non - integer powers of edge variables , together with suitable @xmath98-functions ( analytic regularization ) .",
    "the latter suffices to treat the mellin transforms as used for example in @xcite and discussed below .",
    "we can render the integrand @xmath150 integrable wrt to the domain @xmath153 prescribed by parametric integration by a suitable sum over forests .",
    "we define @xmath154 where for @xmath155 , @xmath156 and the superscript @xmath157 indicates that kinematic variables are specified according to renormalization conditions .",
    "the formula for @xmath158 is correct as long as all sub - graphs are overall log - divergent , the necessary correction terms in the general case are given in @xcite . in our examples",
    "below , we can always identify the one log - divergent subgraph -if any- with the unique non - trivial forest .",
    "accompanying this integrand is the renormalized result which can be written projectively : @xmath159 for notation see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "let us just mention that for the domain of integration we will abbreviate from now on @xmath160 note that this is a well - defined integral obtained from the use of the forest formula .",
    "it is obtained without using an intermediate regulator .",
    "it is well - suited to analyse the mathematical structure of perturbative contributions to green functions .",
    "also , combining this approach with @xcite , it furnishes a reference point against which to check in a situation where intermediate regulators are spoiling the symmetries of the theory .",
    "below , we will shortly compare the structure of this integrand to the appaearance of analytic regulators provided by anomalous dimensions of quantum fields , wich then define mellin transforms for the primitives in the hopf algebra .",
    "feynman graphs have their external edges labelled by momenta , and internal edges labelled by masses .    renormalized feynman rules above are therefore functions of scalar products @xmath161 and mass - squares @xmath162 .",
    "equivalently , upon defining a positive definite linear combination @xmath163 of such variables , we can write them as functions of such a scale @xmath163 , and angles @xmath164 , @xmath165 .",
    "we use @xmath166 to specify scale and angles for the renormalization point . a graph which furnishes only a single scalar product @xmath167 as a scale",
    "is denoted a 1-scale graph .    isolating short - distance singularities in 1-scale sub - graphs",
    "has many advantages , including a systematic separation of angles and scales , and a clean approach to the renormalization group as well as an identification of the freedom provided by exact terms in the hochschild cohomology , as we discuss below , see also @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we have the decomposition    @xmath168    here , the angle - dependent feynman rules @xmath169 are computed by eliminating short - distance singularities through the comparison , via the hopf algebra , with 1-scale graphs evaluated at the same scale as the initial graphs , while the 1-scale feynman rules @xmath170 eliminate short - distance singularities by renormalizing 1-scale graphs at a reference scale @xmath171 .",
    "feynman rules in parametric renormalization allow to treat the computation of feynman graphs as a problem of algebraic geometry , analysing the structure of two kinds of homogeneous polynomials @xcite .",
    "the fact that it is basically the denominator structure which determines the computability of feynman graphs in parametric renormalization makes this approach very efficient in computing periods in the @xmath172-expansion of regularized integrands .",
    "we assume throughout that angles and scales are such that we are off any infrared singularities , for example by off - shell external momenta .",
    "the latter would not be cured by the forest sums which eliminate short - distance singularities .",
    "from now on , we write @xmath173 . for a 1-scale graph @xmath98 , we let @xmath174 be the graph where the two external vertices of @xmath98 are identified .",
    "one has @xmath175 .",
    "assume we are considering a superficially convergent graph @xmath98 free of subdivergences .",
    "for example , a graph @xmath98 in four dimensions of space time on @xmath176 edges delivers the integrable form @xmath177 this is polynomial in the scale dependence , while the angle dependence is di - logarithmic for good reasons @xcite .    inserting logarithmic subdivergences ,",
    "we get the integrable form ( it is integrable as long as external momenta are off - shell such that no infrared singularities arise ) @xmath178 note that @xmath179 .    note that for the logarithmic divergent case @xmath180 , we got a logarithm in the numerator of the renormalized integrand , reflecting the superficial degree of divergence zero . in the convergent case , the above power of @xmath181 is then reflecting the superficial degree of convergence @xmath182 .",
    "consider now a logarithmically divergent graph without sub - divergences , @xmath183 .",
    "then , @xmath184 we have @xmath185 @xmath186 the finite part @xmath187 can equivalently be expressed in the form of overall finite graphs .",
    "let @xmath188 be the propagator at edge @xmath111 , @xmath189 the same propagator , but with its external momenta evaluated as prescribed by the renormalization condition . then , @xmath190 where internal loop momenta in edge @xmath111 drop out in the difference @xmath191 .",
    "by telescoping we can extend to products of propagators provided by graphs , and hence express the finite part of an overall logarithmically divergent graph as an overall convergent graph , which is an element of a larger hopf algebra provided by general feynman integrals .",
    "consider @xmath192 say , as a generic example .",

    "one easily checks that @xmath202 vanishes for @xmath91 greater than the co - radical degree .",
    "let us now consider the primitive @xmath203 .",
    "the two graphs involved are distinguished only by the insertion place into which we insert the subgraph @xmath10 . from the previous result",
    "is it evident that for @xmath203 we could at most find up to a linear term in @xmath73@xmath204 we find for this scheme - independent -and hence well - defined- period @xmath205 where @xmath206 and @xmath207 are obviously independent of the insertion place .",
    "note that the difference is completely governed by @xmath208 as compared to @xmath209 , while for the term constant in @xmath73 we also need to consider @xmath210 as compared to @xmath211 .    from now on",
    "we discard the constant terms in @xmath73 , which we regard as originating from overall convergent integrals .",
    "next , let us look at @xmath45 which is of co - radical degree 1 .",
    "clearly , @xmath212 in general , @xmath213 is not a period but rather a complicated function of @xmath214 .",
    "we now assume that we subtract at @xmath215 .",
    "@xmath213 could then still be a function of the angles @xmath216 .",
    "instead , it is a constant , as is immediately clear by using eq.([ainb ] ) .",
