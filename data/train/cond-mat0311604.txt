    "very soon after the discovery of high-@xmath0 , superconductivity anderson @xcite proposed that it was caused by a cooperative condensation of carriers moving in a resonant valence bond ( rvb ) state of spins .",
    "since then this proposal has been studied extensively and the best account is in anderson s recent lecture notes @xcite .",
    "many other proposals have been made ( for a review see @xcite ) , and there have been questions raised about the use of the simplified effective hamiltonian derived from a single - band hubbard model in the atomic limit that forms the starting point of anderson s treatment .",
    "we shall not go into these questions here but just point out that two of us ( zhang and rice @xcite ) recently gave an explicit demonstration that a two - band model describing hybridised copper 3d and oxygen 2p states can also be reduced to the same effective hamiltonian in an appropriate limit .",
    "the effective hamiltonian contains the strict local constraint which forbids double occupancy of any site .",
    "this constraint is very difficult to handle analytically .",
    "one of the most physically transparent methods to treat this type of problem analytically has been the gutzwiller approximation which introduces a renormalization of the quantum mechanical expectation values by a classical weighting factor @xcite .",
    "such renormalisation can then be incorporated into a hamiltonian which may be treated by conventional methods .",
    "this approach was used for the heavy fermion problem by rice and ueda @xcite and was shown to be equivalent to an optimal slave - boson formulation by kotliar and ruckenstein @xcite . in this paper we will consider this renormilisation hamiltonian method for the effective hamiltonian . unlike the renormalised anderson hamiltonian studied by rice and ueda @xcite , in the present case the renormalised hamiltonian can not be simply diagonalised and we must resort to a further mean - field approximation .",
    "mean - field approaches have been considered by many authors @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . here",
    "we choose to formulate the problem in terms of a variational wave - function .",
    "this has several advantages .",
    "first it shows us that a consistent mean - field theory must be formulated in terms of two expectation values i.e. one must include particle - hole amplitudes of the form @xmath1 in addition to particle - particle amplitudes of the form @xmath2 .",
    "this point has been recently realised by others as well @xcite@xmath3{$_{+}^{+}$in [ 8 ] , baskaran and co - workers considered the term $ \\left\\langle c^{+}c\\right\\rangle $ as well",
    ". however they set it equal to zero in their calculations.}$ ] .",
    "the coupled equations to minimise the energy have a wide class of degenerate solutions at half - filling .",
    "secondly a wave - function formulation is suited to examining the role of the redundancy in the fermion representation which is not present in the spin representation . at half - filling , this redundancy which has its origin in the reduction from 4 to 2 degrees of freedom per site as one goes from fermion to spin representation , appears as a local particle - hole ( @xmath4 ) and gauge ( @xmath5 ) invariance .",
    "the large degeneracy of the mean - field description arises from this redundancy and it can be shown that it corresponds to the same state in the spin representation .",
    "further the appearance of coherence in the fermion representation is illusory so that there can be no true phase coherence as stressed by baskaran and anderson @xcite .",
    "thirdly , this formulation allows a direct comparison with the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) results .",
    "this allows us on the one hand to check the validity of the renormalised mean - field theory and on the other hand it gives us more insight into the numerical vmc results .",
    "both qualitatively and even quantitatively good agreement is found ; for example both point to a d - wave paired state as the most stable and a true superconductivity order parameter which vanishes at half - filling and grows linearly in the deviation from half - filling .",
    "the largest discrepancy occurs for the antiferromagnetic state which , within this scheme is higher in energy than the rvb state , contrary to the vmc results .",
    "our treatment is essentially limited to zero temperature and the extension to finite temperature will be non - trivial . some discussion of the problems of calculating excitation energies is given .",
    "in particular there are two energy scales of excitations given by the gauge coherence energy ( determined by the kinetic energy ) and the magnetic coherence energy respectively .",
    "anderson@xcite has emphasised this splitting of the charged excitations ( holons ) and spin excitations ( spinons ) .",
    "we study the hubbard model on a square lattice . in the limit of large on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath6 and at one - half , or ,",
    "slightly less , filling the hubbard hamiltonian can be transformed to the form@xmath7with the local constraint the number of electrons on any site @xmath81 .",
    "this transformation has a long history , and has been used by @xcite , amongst others . in ( [ equation1 ] )",
    "@xmath9 , and @xmath10 , are the kinetic and magnetic energies respectively and @xmath11 represent the nearest - neighbour pairs .",
    "@xmath12 are the spin @xmath13 operators and @xmath14 .",
    "we neglect terms which are higher order in the small parameters @xmath15 and the hole concentration @xmath16 ( @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the electron concentration ) .    since the high-@xmath0 ,",
    "superconducting materials show strong antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin correlations @xcite it is believed that this model contains the essential physics for the high-@xmath0 , superconductivity @xcite,@xcite .    to study the ground state and the excited states of ( [ equation1 ] ) , we use a projected bcs trial wave - function as suggested by anderson anderson1 for a rvb state:@xmath19@xmath20where the gutzwiller projection operator @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the vacuum state .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are the variational parameters satisfying the normalization condition for @xmath25 : @xmath26 .",
    "some special forms of ( [ equaiton2 ] ) have recently been studied numerically . using the vmc technique , which treats the projection operator exactly @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , yokoyama2 ,",
    "the energies of these states have been numerically calculated .",
    "it is found that in the square lattice , the projected fermi liquid state ( i.e. the state with @xmath27 ) is unstable against d - wave pairing @xcite . at half - filling the energy of the d - wave state",
    "is found @xcite to be very close to the ground - state energy extrapolated from the exact small system calculations @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the extrapolated exact small system calculations , the d - wave trial wave - function has no long range antiferromagnetic order @xcite and may therefore be viewed as an example of a quantum spin liquid .",
    "a vmc study of superconductivity has been made independently by yokoyama and shiba yokoyama2 .",
    "they also concluded a possibility of a d - wave superconductivity .",
    "the projected bcs wave - function is a natural generalization of the usual bcs state to strongly correlated systems .",
    "the projection operator , however , makes difficulties for an analytic approach . in this paper",
    "we shall use a renormalised hamiltonian approach to treat the projection operator , and systematically investigate the state ( [ equaiton2 ] ) , carrying out explicitly the variational procedure . in this approach",
    "following gutzwiller @xcite the effect of the projection operator on the doubly occupied sites is taken into account by a classical statistical weighting factor which multiplies the quantum coherent result calculated with @xmath28 .",
    "a clear description of the method has been given by vollhardt @xcite .",
    "the hopping energy and the spin - spin correlation of the nearest neighbour sites in the state @xmath29 are related to those in the state @xmath30 by@xmath31where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are the expectation values in the states @xmath25 , and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "the renormalization factors @xmath35 and @xmath36 are determined by the ratios of the probabilities of the corresponding physical processes in the states @xmath37 and @xmath25 . in figure 1",
    "we illustrate the possible hopping processes in these two states .",
    "the probability of such a process in the state @xmath34 is@xmath38^{1/2}\\]]while that in the state @xmath25 is@xmath39^{1/2}\\]]@xmath40 are the average electron occupation numbers , ( @xmath41 ) which are the same in the states @xmath37 and @xmath25 , because of the spin symmetry of the wave - functions .",
    "this leads to the result volihardt @xmath42    ) and ( b ) in the projected bcs state ( [ equaiton2 ] ) .",
    "the spins with broken arrows are optional in the ( a ) configurations .",
    "_ , width=312 ]       to determine @xmath36 , we consider the spin exchange process shown in figure 2 .",
    "the spin - spin interaction occurs only when both sites are singly occupied .",
    "the probability for such a process in the state @xmath29 is @xmath43 , while in the state @xmath30 it is @xmath44^{1/2}$ ] . the same result is obtained for the @xmath45 component interaction @xmath46 .",
    "thus one finds@xmath47{$^{+}$in a systematic series expansion on $ \\delta $ and $ % j / t $ , the higher - order terms of $ \\delta $ in ( \\ref{equation4a},\\ref% { equation4b } ) should be dropped away to be consistent with the effective hamiltonian ( \\ref{equation1 } ) , where the higher - order terms are not included .",
    "this , however , does not change the qualitative physics discussed in this paper.}$]@xmath48it is important to realise that the projection operator greatly enhances the spin - spin correlations . to further illustrate this point , we list in table 1 all the possible two - site states together with their weights and the contributions to the spin - spin correlation in the half - filled case .    having determined the renormalisation factors , we can define a renormalised hamiltonian given by @xmath49the energy of the system in the state @xmath34 can be evaluated as the expectation value of @xmath50 in the state @xmath28@xmath51equations ( [ equation4a],[equation4b])-([equation6 ] ) form the basis of our renormalised hamiltonian approach , which is analogous to the approach used by rice and ueda @xcite for the periodic anderson model with the difference that here we make a further mean - field approximation .",
    "this is because in the context of the periodic anderson hamiltonian the most important physical effect is the renormalisation of the f - level to the fermi surface and not the spin interaction , which would make an exact treatment of the effective hamiltonian impossible .    to justify this approach ,",
    "we have carried out monte carlo calculations .",
    "figures 3 - 5 show the comparisons between the renormalised mean - field theory and the essentially exact mc results for these wave - functions .",
    "the quantitative agreement is within 5 - 15% , while the qualitative agreement is excellent for the wave - function ( [ equaiton2 ] ) .    after replacing the projection operator ,",
    "the energy of the system can be evaluated analytically .",
    "the variational task is to minimise @xmath52 in ( equation6 ) .",
    "this leads to coupled gap equations , which we will derive and solve in the following sections .",
    "in this section we derive the gap equations for the projected bcs wave - function within the renormalised hamiltonian scheme described in section2 .",
    "we consider only the even - parity case , i.e. , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .    evaluating ( [ equation6 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the total number of sites , and @xmath57@xmath58@xmath59    note that @xmath60 and @xmath61 have the same functional form , since @xmath62 is derived by kinetic exchange . the electron number operator @xmath63 has expectation value @xmath64 .",

    "it describes the smearing of the pseudo - fermi surface .",
    "however , @xmath73 is not the superconducting order parameter in the projected state @xmath37 in our theory .",
    "@xmath92 turns out to be the quasi - particle excitation energy ( in units of @xmath93 ) in the pairing state as we will show in section5 .",
    "the coupled gap equations ( [ equation14 ] ) are the basic equations in our approach .",
    "they can also be written in the @xmath94 and @xmath83 component form:@xmath95@xmath96the gap equations must be solved simultaneously with the hole concentration equation , @xmath97 .    before we discuss the non - trivial solutions , we note that @xmath98 is a trivial solution of the gap equations .",
    "this corresponds to the projected fermi - liquid state . in this case ,",
    "@xmath74 changes sign at the fermi surface .",
    "the parameters @xmath99 are given by@xmath100the volume of the fermi sea is determined by the number of electrons .",

    "the gap equations then reduce to a single equation , and we get @xmath111which has numerical value @xmath112 .",
    "the energy per site is@xmath113this energy is much lower ( about 20% ) than that of the projected fermi - liquid state found above .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 describes the pairing correlation in the renormalised hamiltonian .",
    "finite values of @xmath73 indicate the binding of the electron pairs in the pairing states ( [ equaiton3 ] ) .",
    "we now determine the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath114 ,  required for the choice of @xmath92 in ( [ equation16 ] ) . using ( [ equation9d ] ) and ( [ equation10 ] )",
    ", we find that they should satisfy the following simultaneous equations:@xmath115@xmath116    there is a wide class of parameters which satisfy the  conditions ( equation17 ) .",
    "all the states in this class give the same expectation value of the renormalised hamiltonian @xmath50 in ( [ equation5 ] ) .",
    "therefore at the half - filling , @xmath50 has a large degeneracy of ground states . for real @xmath117 and @xmath118 ,",
    "these states can be illustrated diagrammatically as shown in figure 6(a ) .",
    "a few examples of these states are    d - wave pairing : @xmath119    d - wave density matrix:@xmath120    chiral state:@xmath121    anisotropic state:@xmath122we remark that the d - wave density matrix state is different from the extended s - wave state proposed by baskaran , zou and anderson @xcite . in their theory , the particle - hole amplitude @xmath123 is not included , i.e. @xmath124 .",
    "therefore their state has the same energy as the projected fermi - liquid state .",
    "the d - wave pairing state was studied numerically in @xcite and @xcite , and the chiral state was discussed in @xcite .",
    "they belong to the solutions of the same gap equations in the present approach .",
    "the degeneracy of the ground states of @xmath50 may be explained using the local @xmath4 symmetry of the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath62 .",
    "this symmetry has been pointed out by anderson @xcite .",
    "very recently affeck and co - workers @xcite have studied the invariance under a time - dependent @xmath4 gauge transformation , and discussed the equivalence of some different mean - field theories . here",
    "we wish to show that the symmetry described in ( [ equation17 ] ) is a sub - group of the local @xmath4 , which preserves translational invariance and even parity that we imposed in deriving the gap equations .    consider a local @xmath4 gauge transformation , under which electron operators at site @xmath85 transform as@xmath125@xmath126where @xmath127 .",
    "these are the particle - hole  transformations with spin conservation .",
    "@xmath62 , hence @xmath50 at half - filling is invariant under these transformations .",
    "therefore all the states related by ( [ equation19 ] ) are degenerate .",
    "a set of the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath114 , in our gap equations transforms to another set of the parameters under ( [ equation19 ] ) .",
    "the transformations corresponding to the degenerate state ( [ equation17 ] ) derived from the gap equations are represented in figure 6(b ) , for real values of @xmath88 .",
    "there is also one to one correspondence to transformations of the d - wave pairing state to a state with complex @xmath88 such as the chiral state ( [ equaiton18c ] ) with @xmath128 and @xmath129 complex .",
    "local @xmath5 gauge symmetry is a sub - group of the local @xmath4 symmetry since it is of the form@xmath130a general choice of @xmath131 transforms the bcs pairing state ( equaiton3 ) to a non - bcs - type state , which has the same energy as the former .",
    "since under such a transformation the bloch coherence is lost , i.e. a state of the form@xmath132is no longer a coherent superposition of the original states .",
    "yet we can equally well pair @xmath133 with @xmath134 , and the energy would be the same as if we pair @xmath135 with @xmath136 .",
    "thus the apparent coherent k - space pairing in the bcs wave - function ( [ equaiton3 ] ) is illusory .",
    "the absence of a coherent pairing order parameter at half - filling as a consequence of the @xmath5 gauge invariance has been stressed by baskaran and anderson @xcite .",
    "it is important to realise that the states that are degenerate due to the @xmath137 gauge  symmetry are the unprojected states @xmath30 of ( 3 ) , rather than the physical states @xmath29 which obey the strict local constraint . how does a projected state change under @xmath4 ? according to ( [ equation19 ] ) , a vacuum state ( empty state ) at site",
    "@xmath85 must transform under @xmath4 as@xmath138this ensures that the vanishing of the state @xmath139 remains unchanged under the transformation as required physically .",
    "however a singly occupied electron state transforms under @xmath4 as@xmath140at half - filling , each site is singly occupied .",
    "therefore any half - filled state @xmath34 transforms into itself except for an overall phase factor under the @xmath4 operator @xmath141:@xmath142    although @xmath141 does not commute with the projection operator @xmath143 , we observe for the half - filled state @xmath25@xmath144one way to see this is to notice that there is no empty site state also in @xmath145 .",
    "thus we can rewrite@xmath146the @xmath4 transformations all commute with the operator @xmath147 .",
    "let @xmath148 , and @xmath149 , then@xmath150this proves explicitly that the two states @xmath151 and @xmath152 related by any local @xmath4 gauge transformation correspond to the same state @xmath37 except for a phase factor .",
    "therefore all the states in ( [ equation17 ] ) correspond to the same physical state .",
    "the rvb ground state is non - degradable .",
    "there are also redundancies in the higher energy states in the fermion representation .",
    "for instance , the state of baskaran , zou and anderson baskaran1 at half - filled is identical to the projected fermi liquid state , because the former transforms to the latter under ( [ equation19 ] ) with @xmath153 in one sublattice , and @xmath154 in the other .",
    "this equivalence was also pointed out by yokoyama and shiba yokoyama1 in a different way .",
    "we now comment on the local gauge symmetry in the original hubbard model , which in terms of the original fermion operator is@xmath155 this hamiltonian is not invariant under local gauge transformations with respect to the operators @xmath156 .",
    "however , up to any finite order in @xmath15 there exists a canonical transformation , which eliminates the doubly occupied sites @xcite@xmath157at half - filling , all the odd order terms in @xmath15 vanish .",
    "the hamiltonian is locally gauge invariant with respect to the electron operators in the new representation , i.e. the @xmath158 of ( [ equation1 ] ) are wannier operators of the old representation , @xmath156 .",
    "therefore the local gauge symmetry holds to any finite order in perturbation theory in @xmath15 .",
    "this is the same as saying that the system has undergone a transition to a mott insulator @xcite .",
    "we have so far only examined the projected bcs - type trial wave - functions .",
    "it is likely that the true ground state of the model hamiltonian ( equation1 ) at half - filled is the af state @xcite .",
    "recently , yokoyama and shiba @xcite,@xcite have studied a projected hartree - fock - type af state .",
    "using vmc they found the energy per site at half - filled to be @xmath159 , slightly lower than @xmath160 , the value found by gros @xcite in the d - wave pairing state by using a similar technique .",
    "however we may argue that the holes favour the pairing state away from half - filled because of the gain in kinetic energy .",
    "we have also applied the renormalised hamiltonian approach to the af states . within this approximation",
    ", we find that at the half - filled , the af state has higher energy than the rvb state ( [ equaiton2 ] ) , in contrast with the vmc results .",
    "we present the derivation and the results in appendix 1 .",
    "firstly we examine the energy needed to create propagating bloch states .",
    "the simplest states for holes have the form@xmath161which destroys a real electron at site @xmath85 .",
    "we may also make a propagating bloch state for the hole of the form    @xmath162    a rigorous calculation is possible at half - filling .",
    "we consider any translationally invariant spin singlet state @xmath29 at half - filling .",
    "let us denote by @xmath128 the nn spin - spin correlation in @xmath34 , @xmath163 .",
    "then the magnetic energy loss of a hole in the state @xmath164 is @xmath165 , because the four bonds connecting the site @xmath85 are mixing .",
    "since the matrix of @xmath62 in ( equaiton2 ) between any states @xmath166 and @xmath167 is diagonal , the moving hole state of ( [ equation20 ] ) has the same magnetic energy as in @xmath168 .",
    "the kinetic energy of the hole in ( [ equation20 ] ) is given by@xmath169where @xmath170 denotes the expectation value in the half - filled state .",
    "using the fact that @xmath171 = 1 , we get @xmath172since @xmath173 for the ground state , ( [ equation21 ] ) gives a band width for a bloch hole of @xmath174 .",
    "the minimum energy to remove an electron and create such a bloch hole is @xmath175 .",
    "the bloch states are not the lowest energy states of the holes however .",
    "we now apply the gap equations to study a system with a few pair of holes .",
    "the energy to create a pair of holes is @xmath176 by the definition of the chemical potential . since the parameter @xmath105 at the half - filled , ( [ equation11 ] ) gives the energy per hole to be @xmath177 , a quantity related to the unprojected state @xmath178 at half - filling . in the presence of holes ,",
    "the kinetic part of the hamiltonian explicitly breaks the @xmath4 and @xmath179 gauge symmetries , while the heisenberg spin part remains invariant under these symmetries .    using ( [ equation4a],[equation4b ] ) and ( [ equation5 ] ) , for the states",
    "@xmath180 described by ( [ equation17 ] ) , the magnetic energy per hole is @xmath181a value equivalent to the loss of four bonds in the spinspin correlations , and it is the same for all these states as a consequence of the @xmath4 gauge invariance of the spin part of the hamiltonian @xmath62 .",
    "the kinetic energy per hole in this case is given by@xmath182@xmath87 , is the particle - hole correlation in @xmath183 as defined in ( [ equation13 ] ) .",
    "when the holes are introduced , a fraction ( @xmath35 ) of this correlation becomes coherent in the state @xmath34 .",
    "therefore the larger values of @xmath114 , correspond to the lower kinetic energy of the holes .",
    "but @xmath114 , are subject to ( [ equation17 ] ) .",
    "the kinetic energy can be written in the following form by using ( [ equation17 ] ) : @xmath184different parameters @xmath88 , and @xmath87 , describe different states with different energies upon doping .",
    "the above hole kinetic energy expression immediately leads to the important conclusion that the d - wave pairing state , where @xmath185 gives the best kinetic energy , which is @xmath186both the d - wave density matrix state ( [ equaiton18b ] ) and the chiral state ( [ equaiton18c ] ) have zero kinetic energies , and are not favoured upon doping .",
    "the kinetic energy for the d - wave pairing state in our analytical approach is quite close to the vmc result , where it is found to be @xmath187 for systems with 10% holes @xcite .",
    "it is also substantially below the value found for a bloch hole .",
    "the introduction of some holes breaks the local gauge symmetry and causes the ground state to be coherent .",
    "the stable lowest energy state upon doping is the d - wave pairing state .",
    "it is worthwhile remarking that in a hubbard model it is the expectation value of the kinetic energy which determines the integrated optical weight associated with the charge carriers in the f - sum rule @xcite and in the present case this optical weight is proportional to the number of holes with an optical mass determined from the proportionality constant of order @xmath188 ( where @xmath189 is the lattice constant ) .",
    "the gap equations for the finite hole concentrations can be solved numerically . here",

    "in this case , we set @xmath190 , and @xmath191 .",

    "@xmath202 found in our theory is in good agreement with the monte carlo results [ @xcite ] .",
    "the absence of the superconducting order parameter at half - filled obtained from ( equation22 ) agrees with the discussion in section4 from the viewpoint of the local gauge symmetry .",
    "the kinetic energy of holes in the af state is found to be quite high in our analytic approach ( see appendix 1 ) . however , the gutzwiller approximation we adopted is too rough to determine whether a rvb or af state has lower energy .",
    "numerical results of vmc @xcite , @xcite , yokoyama2 suggest both the spin - spin correlation energy and the kinetic energy of the holes between the d - wave pairing state and the af states are very close . the question which state is more favourable in energy remains unresolved .",
    "we begin by examining the spin degrees of freedom in half - filled and near half - filled cases .",
    "an excited state can be created by applying the spin raising operator to a specific site to obtain@xmath203we can commute @xmath204 with @xmath143 , to obtain@xmath205this state is therefore a superposition of two independent quasi - particle states similar to a metal where the low energy excitations are made up of superpositions of electron and hole states .",
    "the quasi - particle states ( spinons ) can be defined by@xmath206the quasi - particle energy @xmath207 , is defined to be the difference of the expectation values of @xmath208 in the state @xmath209 and in the ground state @xmath29 .",
    "we use the gutzwiller method to calculate the energy of the state ( [ equation23 ] ) .",
    "the energy difference between the two states contains two parts .",
    "one is due to the changes of the renormalization factors @xmath35 and @xmath210 , the other comes from the change of the wave - function itself .",
    "the former just cancels exactly the second term in @xmath65 in ( equation11 ) . using ( [ equation7 ] ) to calculate the energy difference due to the wave - function change ,",
    "we get@xmath211applying the gap equations to simplify the expression , we obtain@xmath212note this energy is independent of the local @xmath4 gauge and does not depend on the particular fermion representation . at the pseudo - fermi surface , where by definition @xmath213 , we have @xmath214 .",
    "since the state ( [ equation23 ] ) breaks a pair of electrons , @xmath207 describes the binding energy of the pair at the pseudo - fermi surface .",
    "the excitation energy depends on the particular rvb . for the fermi liquid state ( @xmath215 ) then @xmath216 over the whole pseudo - fermi surface .",
    "however in the ground rvb state it vanishes only at four points , e.g. when @xmath217 , @xmath218 , if @xmath219 and the density of spinon states at low energies is@xmath220    we turn now to a brief discussion of the system at finite temperature .",
    "the extension of the mean - field gap equations to finite @xmath221 is not so straightforward .",
    "the existence of a finite @xmath73 is controlled by the energy scale of @xmath222  i.e. by @xmath195 in ( equation24 ) . on the other hand",
    "if we consider the limit @xmath223 there is a very small energy scale @xmath224 which controls the definition of a coherent gauge .",
    "in other words it is only the kinetic energy which allows us to determine the gauge uniquely and at temperatures @xmath225 , the gauge coherence will be lost . yet in this temperature range the magnetic coherence survives since as we have stressed earlier this is independent of the choice of gauge on each site .",
    "the properties of the system in this temperature region are clearly very different from fermi liquid behaviour as anderson has stressed and these two energy scales should correspond to his ` holon ' and ` spinon ' energy scales respectively .",
    "the thermopower should obey the heikes formula @xcite and we can expect only a low mobility of the holes .",
    "however , a more detailed study of this regime is required .",
    "we have used a variational method to study a projected bcs trial wave - function for the square lattice effective hamiltonian . using a gutzwiller approximation to treat the effect of the projection operator",
    ", we obtained a renormalised hamiltonian in which the projection operator is replaced by renormalisation factors .",
    "this approximation is shown to be in good agreement with numerical monte carlo calculations for such projected wave - functions . in this mean - field approximation",
    "both particle - particle and particle - hole pairing amplitudes must be included .",
    "the fermion representation for the ground state at the half - filled band is highly redundant , due to a local @xmath4 invariance at exactly half - filling .",
    "this redundancy is reflected in an apparent degeneracy of the bcs trial wave - function before projection .",
    "doping destroys the local @xmath4 invariance and splits these degenerate states , and we find that the stable state upon doping is the d - wave pairing rvb state . in this rvb state ,",
    "electrons are paired even at half - filling and it costs an energy of order @xmath195 to break a pair .",
    "these pre - existing electron pairs lead to a non - zero superconductivity amplitude upon doping , and the magnitude of this superconducting amplitude or order parameter is shown to be proportional to the hole concentration @xmath16 when @xmath16 is small .",
    "the elementary excitations at half - filling are the projected bcs quasi - particle states or spinons , with four point zeros on the pseudo - fermi surface .",
    "our analytic approach can also be applied to 1d and systems with dimensionality @xmath226 .",
    "we find that lowest energy state in 1d is the projected fermi liquid rvb without electron pairing , as shown in appendix 2 .",
    "our theory predicts no superconductivity in a 1d rvb . for large @xmath227 ,",
    "the energy per bond in the rvb pairing state is proportional to @xmath228 , reduces relative to an af .",
    "so the pairing state is particularly favourable in 2d .",
    "the precise form of the 2d phase diagrams which depends sensitively on the relative energies of the af and d - wave rvb states as a function of @xmath16 is too subtle a question to be settled by the approximation we use here .",
    "there are many questions that require further investigation such as the exact relationship between the discussion here in terms of phase coherence among the paired electrons and anderson s holon @xcite concept or the nature of the high - temperature phase where this phase coherence is lost but strong magnetic correlations remain and presumably do not lead to a fermi liquid that is the usual description of a normal state .",
    "we would like to thank d poilblanc , r joynt , m roos , t k lee , g kotliar for many useful discussions . financial support from the swiss nationalfonds is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "in this appendix , we use the renormalised hamiltonian approach to study the projected spin - density - wave state for effective hamiltonian ( [ equation1 ] ) . that state was proposed and studied using vmc by yokoyama and shiba yokoyama1 .",
    "the generalisation of the gutzwiller method to the antiferromagnetic states for the hopping process was formulated by ogawa and co - workers @xcite .",

    "the renormalisation factors reduce to ( equation4a,[equation4b ] ) in the case @xmath240 , and the form for @xmath35 agrees with @xcite .    within this scheme , we obtain the energy per site at half - filling@xmath241where@xmath242the spin - spin correlation @xmath243 , and the staggered magnetisation is@xmath244with @xmath245 , the occupation number in the state @xmath246 . @xmath247 and @xmath248 ,",

    "the case @xmath249 corresponds to the projected fermi liquid state , while @xmath250 corresponds to the n@xmath251el state .",
    "the results agree well for large values of @xmath234 , but there are substantial deviations for small @xmath234 .",
    "the kinetic energy per hole in our theory is@xmath252for the optimal value of @xmath253 , @xmath254 , substantially higher than that in the d - wave pairing state .",
    "note that this value is also higher than that found in the vmc calculation @xcite , where the optimal aaf is found to be much smaller .",
    "the renormalised hamiltonian approach can be straightforwardly applied to the model ( [ equation1 ] ) in 1d .",
    "using the projected bcs wave - function ( [ equaiton2 ] ) , and the same technique for 2d , we have found that the rvb ground state  at the half - filling is described by an equation between @xmath255 , and @xmath117 ( defined in ( [ equation12])-([equation13])):@xmath256with@xmath257([a2.1 ] ) is parallel to ( [ equation17 ] ) in 2d .",
    "similar to the 2d case , different parameters in ( [ a2.1 ] ) are related to each other under the @xmath4 gauge transformation , and correspond to the same physical state .",
    "this state is described by the projected fermi liquid state , where @xmath258 , @xmath259 .",
    "earlier monte carlo calculations @xcite and more recent exact calculation @xcite with this wave - function have shown that the energy of this state is extremely close to the exact solution @xcite .",
    "the energy per site in our analytic mean - field approach is @xmath260 .",
    "this value deviates by about 37% from the true result @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this quantitative discrepancy however is not surprising , because the gutzwiller approximation is poor in 1d .    in parallel to the discussion in section4 , we can study the system with some holes .",
    "we found that the stable lowest - energy state corresponds to @xmath258 . introducing the finite value of @xmath261 ,",
    "the system loses kinetic energy .",
