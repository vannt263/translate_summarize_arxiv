    "mathematical modelling of the phenomena of disease spreading has a long history , the first such attempts being made in the early twentieth century .",
    "typically , an individual is assumed to be in either in one of the three possible states : susceptible , infected and removed ( or recovered ) denoted by s , i , and r respectively in the simplest models .",
    "diseases which can be contracted only once are believed to be described by the sir model in which a susceptible individual gets infected by an infected agent who is subsequently removed ( dead or recovered ) .",
    "a removed person no longer takes part in the dynamics . in sis model",
    ", an infected person may become susceptible again .",
    "plenty of variations and modifications of the sir and sis models have been considered over the last few decades .",
    "resurgence of interest in these models has taken place following the discovery that social networks do not behave like random or regular networks @xcite .",
    "the recent emphasis has been to study these models on complex networks like small world and scale free networks .",
    "a few surprising results have been derived theoretically in the recent past @xcite .    in mathematical models ,",
    "one quantifies the infection probability . in most theoretical models ,",
    "the epidemic has a threshold behaviour as the infection probability is varied .",
    "however , an estimate of this quantity from real data is difficult as it is related to biological features like nature of the pathogen etc .",
    "the test of a model lies in its ability to match real data .",
    "not appreciable success has been made so far although some qualitative consistency has been achieved @xcite .",
    "the available data is usually in the form of number of newly infected patients and total ( cumulative ) number of cases . in the sir model",
    ", the newly infected fraction shows an initial growth followed by a peak and a subsequent decay .",
    "this matches with the overall structure of the real data ( e.g. for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) ) , which however , show local oscillatory behaviour in addition .",
    "such a behaviour may be due to demographic non uniformity @xcite .",
    "it is meaningful to study the epidemic spreading by considering that the agents are embedded on an euclidean space .",
    "a few models on euclidean networks have been studied earlier which show that the geographical factor plays an important role in the spreading process @xcite . in particular , the sir model on an euclidean network where the agents may be connected to a few randomly chosen long range neighbours with a probability decaying with the euclidean distance has been considered is some detail @xcite .    in 2014 ,",
    "the ebola virus caused large scale outbreaks mainly in three west african countries and only recently it has been declared as over ( june 2016 ) .",
    "ebola virus is transmitted through body fluids and blood and it is also believed that a person can contract the disease only once .",
    "a few attempts have been made to analyse the data so far @xcite .",
    "different factors like demographic effect , hospitalization , vaccination and treatment plans have been incorporated in the traditional and well - known sir model to understand the dynamics of ebola disease @xcite . however , in these models , a mean field approximation has been used which is rather unphysical . using the results of an agent based sir model on euclidean network mentioned in the last paragraph @xcite",
    ", we have analysed the ebola data for the three countries guinea , liberia and sierra leone in west africa where the outbreak extended over approximately two years .    in section",
    "ii , we discuss the details of the available data and the method of the analysis . analysis of the data and simulation results are presented in section iii and in the last section summary and discussions are made .",
    "we consulted the ebola data for the number of cases detected in the three countries guinea , liberia and sierra leone in west africa ( the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) @xcite ) .",
    "the data is available from 25th march 2014 to 13th april 2016 at the time interval of a few days .",
    "the data is noisy and contains obvious errors as often the cumulative data is shown to decrease .",
    "the first available data is from march 2014 when guinea was already struck with the disease for some time ( first case in guinea reported in december 2013 ) such that the data for the initial period is missing . for liberia and sierra leone , the data for initial stage are available , however these are sparse and unreliable ; often the data for number of death exceeds the number of cases .",
    "for this reason , the data has been analysed from the date when the number of cases detected is at least @xmath5 for each country .",
    "even then the errors can not be fully avoided as for very late stages , the data being rare , also become somewhat unreliable .",
    "hence , the entire data set has to be handled carefully .    in table",
    "[ tab : statistics ] , a summary of the statistics of the ebola data is presented and one can immediately note that all cases could not have been confirmed in the laboratory in the case of liberia where number of deaths exceeds the laboratory confirmed cases . obviously many cases were unreported . for guinea",
    ", these two figures are closest and the data for guinea is in fact the cleanest one .",
    "we have studied the available data for total ( cumulative ) number of cases @xmath6 as a function time @xmath7 and extracted the data for number of new cases @xmath8 from these .",
    "another point needs to be mentioned .",
    "the disease has been officially declared over on 1st june 2016 for guinea , 9th june 2016 for liberia and 17th march 2016 for sierra leone @xcite .",
    "but one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : gls ] that the cumulative data shows a saturation over fairly long period of time .",
    "apparently a few stray cases delayed the declaration of the disease being over . for liberia , for example",
    ", the disease was originally declared to be over as early as in may 2015 but two small flare - ups were reported later .",
    "however the cumulative data is hardly affected by the later cases .",
    ".statistics of ebola data for three different countries . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : expo_model ]",
    "we have analysed the data for ebola outbreak in west african countries which are available for 2014 - 16 and also reproduced qualitatively the data using a model of epidemic spreading . in this section",
    "we justify the choice of the parameters used in the model to obtain the results consistent with the real data .",
    "we have already justified the choice of @xmath3 between @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the last section .",
    "we have used a larger value of @xmath3 for sierra leone and a smaller value of @xmath4 for guinea to get the consistency .    to justify why @xmath3 should be larger for sierra leone",
    "we note the following .",
    "sierra leone and liberia are comparable in size but the density of population is much higher in the former .",
    "the density of population is @xmath11/km@xmath12 and @xmath13/km@xmath12 respectively for the two countries @xcite .",
    "hence the number of neighbours within the same distance is larger for sierra leone which implies a larger value of @xmath3 effectively .    on the other hand ,",
    "the population densities of guinea ( @xmath14/km@xmath12 ) @xcite and liberia are quite close so that one should use the same @xmath3 value .",
    "however , we need to justify why a smaller value of @xmath4 is able to reproduce the data for guinea . a smaller value of @xmath4 indicates less infection probability which is possible if proper medical care and control measurements are taken .",
    "this is indeed true as we find from several documents that the disease was tackled most effectively in guinea .",
    "table [ tab : statistics ] clearly shows that the maximum percentage of cases for guinea were laboratory - tested which indicates that the process of contact tracing and treatment were more efficient .",
    "this is supported by the fact that in guinea , about @xmath15 contacts per infected person were traced compared to @xmath16 in case of sierra leone @xcite .",
    "we find from @xcite that msf treated the largest number of reported cases in guinea , in sierra leone the minimum out of reported cases .",
    "thus most cases in sierra leone , even when reported , had received less attention while in liberia , a large number is not confirmed or reported at all . apparently , medical centers by international organisations have also been set up much earlier in guinea as it was the epicenter of the disease and the disease started as early as in 2013 december .",
    "however , later activities could control the disease in liberia and sierra leone as well , and the final number of deaths had been far less than initially anticipated .",
    "we also note a curious fact - though guinea may have recorded the minimum number of cases , yet the disease spanned a longer duration compared to liberia .",
    "further analysis , beyond the scope of the present paper , may be able to explain this .    we add here a few more relevant comments .",
    "we note that while qualitative features of the data obtained from the model are quite similar to the real data , quantitatively they are much larger . this may be due to the fact that for the real data , the entire population has been taken to obtain the fractions while the disease might not have prevailed in such totality due to geographical or other factors .",
    "we have also made simple assumptions like homogeneity , i.e. , uniform number of contacts for all agents .",
    "the initial condition has been taken to be identical : the disease commences with only one infected people .",
    "our assumption that agents are immobile is supported by @xcite in which it is argued that migration does not play a role in the spreading .",
    "even so , this simple model is able to yield data which is consistent with real data .",
    "the effect of the ebola outbreak has been devastating in the west african countries .",
    "apart from the human losses , economic loss has also been considerable @xcite .",
    "the present study shows that the euclidean model can be treated as a basic starting point and can be further developed by adding other features",
    ". this will make it very useful and important for making accurate predictions .",
    "work is in progress towards that direction .",
