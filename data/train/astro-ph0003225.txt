    "one of the major steps in the understanding of galaxy evolution was the realization that tails and bridges are the result of galaxy interactions ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was also proposed by toomre ( 1977 ) to use the morphology of the observed tidal features and the separation between the galaxies in order to create a `` merging sequence '' of 11 peculiar ngc galaxies , also found in the arp atlas .",
    "ever since , improvements in numerical modeling of the stellar and gaseous component in galaxies have clearly demonstrated that galaxy interactions cause large scale instabilities in the galactic disks leading to the formation of transient bars which drive the gas into the center of the galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , numerous multi - wavelength studies of those systems ( see hibbard 1995 ; schweizer 1998 and references therein ) have been performed in effort to better understand phenomena such as starburst and agn activity , as well as mass transfers and morphological transformations associated with interacting galaxies .",
    "one of the major quests in those studies remained the identification of observational characteristics which could be used as alternatives of assigning an `` age '' to the event of the interaction ( i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "the discovery by iras of the class of luminous ir galaxies which harbor of obscured massive starbursts ( @xcite ) and the revelation later on that they are also interacting / merging systems ( @xcite ) , attracted further attention to this problem ( see @xcite for a review ) .    in this paper",
    "we examine the global star formation activity in a sample of interacting galaxies as it becomes evident in the mid - infrared via the heating of the dust .",
    "the galaxies of our sample were part of the isocam ( @xcite ) active galaxy proposal camactiv ( p.i .",
    "f. mirabel ) .",
    "the galaxies were observed in the spectro - imaging mode with the circular variable filter ( cvf ) or , for weaker sources , in the raster mode with broad band filters .",
    "information on the whole camactic sample as well as on the observational techniques can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the standard data reduction procedures pertinent to isocam data were followed resulting in a photometric accuracy of 20% .",
    "the galaxies were selected with an _ apriori knowledge _ of their stage of interaction and also based on the fact that the agn contribution is negligible in the mid - infrared ( @xcite ) .",
    "they form an evolution sequence from galaxies in early stages of interaction : ngc4676 , ngc 3263 , and ngc 520 ; to galaxies approaching a merger stage : ngc3256 , ngc6240 and arp220 ; and finally to the classified late merger remnants : ngc7252 and ngc3921 .",
    "the selection process and details on the galaxies are beyond the scope of this paper and will be presented in @xcite .",
    "in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we present mid - infrared images and integrated spectra of the galaxies in our sample . all galaxies show evidence of star formation activity as it s indicated by the presence of the unidentified infrared bands ( uibs ) in their spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "two trends became apparent from those figures :    as we move from early stage interactions to mergers the continuum at 12 - 16@xmath3 m is rising very steeply .",
    "this continuum is attributed to very small grains ( vsgs ) with radius less than 10 nm ( @xcite ) , and is prominent in regions actively forming stars .",
    "it reaches its peak in ngc6240 and arp220 , which host massive starbursts , and progressively becomes flatter in post - starburst systems .",
    "the fraction of the mid - infrared flux associated with the uib features decreases when we reach the starburst face .",
    "this can be easily seen by observing the strength of the 7.7@xmath3 m feature .",
    "this could be due to the fact than in massive starbursts one has numerous young stars and their associated hii regions . as a result the filling factor of the photodissociation regions where uibs form would decrease as well as the corresponding uib emission .",
    "one can attempt to quantify this phenomenon by observing the variation of the global mid - infrared colors of the galaxies .",
    "we present the flux ratio the total broad band lw3(12 - 18@xmath0)/lw2(5 - 8.5@xmath3 m ) for our galaxies in figure 3 .",
    "this has been proposed as an indicator of the fraction of the vsg continuum to the uib feature emission and it is close to 1 for quiescent star formation ( @xcite ) . as we clearly see",
    "this ratio presents a monotonic variation with the intensity of the star formation activity in the galaxies .",
    "we can also examine how the iras colors vary across the same sequence of galaxies .",
    "of particular interest is the iras60@xmath0/iras100@xmath2 ratio since this indicates the location of the peak of the spectral energy distribution .",
    "the correlation of the isocam lw3/lw2 diagnostic ratio with the iras colors is apparent .",
    "the only discrepant point is ngc4676 , but this can be understood since the one of the galaxies has an old stellar population which can contribute to the mid - infrared emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "this result suggests that _ even though the bolometric luminosity of interacting luminous infrared galaxies is found at @xmath4 , the study of the mid - infrared spectral energy distribution can be used to trace the location of the far - infrared peak_. moreover , the higher spatial resolution one can achieve in the mid - infrared ( @xcite ) would further facilitate the identification of the most active regions in the galaxies ( ie .",
    "@xcite )      strong absorption by dust can distort the apparent morphology of interacting galaxies , hiding the main heating source and revealing to us only reprocessed radiation .",
    "consequently , iso estimates of the absorption using measurements of line strengths ( @xcite ) may be biased towards lower limits .",
    "the use of the depth of the 9.6@xmath3 m silicate absorption feature could be an alternative , but as seen in arp220 this feature can often be nearly saturated and the underlying continuum is poorly determined .",
    "irs , the infrared spectrograph ( @xcite ) on board sirtf , with a spectral coverage from 5.3 to 40 @xmath3 m will enable to address this issue .",
    "improved estimates on the absorption could be obtained using the depth of both silicate absorption bands ( at 9.6 and 18 @xmath3 m ) and the shape of the mid - infrared continuum ( @xcite ) . moreover",
    ", the superb sensitivity and good spatial and spectral resolution of irs will allow us to further expand the diagnostic of fig.3 in fainter more distant systems ."
