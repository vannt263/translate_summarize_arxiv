    "increasing the range or strength of electrostatic interactions enhances the coulomb repulsion between any two charged vertices , making them move apart .",
    "however , the resulting extension in edge lengths is penalized by the rise in the stretching energy . in addition",
    ", the bending energy term penalizes any sharp changes in curvature , thus favoring transitions to smooth shapes .",
    "this competition between the electrostatic and elastic energies sets an effective area for the nanomembrane which in conjunction with the fixed - volume constraint determines the eventual shape of the nanoshell .",
    "varying the screening length or the total charge on the shell changes this effective area , leading to variations in the shell shape .",

    "the electrostatic energy on the disc ( first row ) is higher in the center where the opposite faces are nearby ( first row ) .",
    "the five - coordinated vertices , which are visible as spots in the electrostatic energy distribution , lead to small fluctuations in the energy . ]    to substantiate the above explanation , we focus on the sphere - to - ellipsoid - to - disc part of the observed shape transitions and perform analytical calculations .",
    "judging by the simulation snapshots ( see the images in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , rightmost column ) , these shapes can be approximated as oblate spheroids with different degrees of eccentricity @xmath65 and major semiaxis lengths @xmath66 .",
    "since the volume of the shell is fixed , the oblate spheroidal shell can be characterized by a single parameter @xmath65 . for @xmath67 ,",
    "one obtains sphere - like shapes and @xmath68 leads to disc - like conformations .",
    "the competition between elastic and electrostatic energies can now be considered as determining the eccentricity @xmath65 for the oblate spheroid .",
    "the concentration @xmath37 is seen as the control over @xmath65 such that the lowering of @xmath37 can be understood as an increase in @xmath65 .",
    "thus , we can verify the order of shape transitions observed in our simulations by examining the change in the electrostatic energy of a uniformly - charged shell as its eccentricity is increased .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider unscreened coulomb interactions in the following calculations .",
    "we evaluate the electrostatic energy @xmath69 of a uniformly - charged oblate spheroidal shell with total surface charge @xmath70 and with volume constrained to @xmath71 ( derivation in _ si text _ ) .",
    "we obtain : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an even integer , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are legendre polynomials of first and second kind , @xmath76 , and @xmath69 is evaluated relative to the thermal energy at room temperature .",
    "we define @xmath77 as the electrostatic energy of the oblate spheroid relative to the electrostatic energy of the sphere with identical parameters .",
    "we examine the variation of @xmath77 vs @xmath65 for the parameter set associated with the transition recorded in the open blue circles of fig . 3 and find that the coulomb energy of an oblate spheroidal shell subject to the constraint of constant volume decreases with increasing its eccentricity ( see fig . s2 ) .",
    "in other words , a disc - shaped shell has lower coulomb energy than a sphere of the same volume .",
    "the order of shape transitions observed in our simulations is thus backed by the above analytical result .",
    "next , we examine the spatial distribution of the local electrostatic energy @xmath78 on the surface of the shell ( see _ si text _ for details ) .",
    "we find that for a spherical shell , @xmath78 is constant everywhere .",
    "however , as the eccentricity increases , the surface distribution of electrostatic energy becomes increasingly inhomogeneous .",
    "in particular , for @xmath79 , which corresponds to a disc - like shape , we find @xmath78 varies significantly on the disc surface , assuming higher values near the disc center and low magnitude near the edge of the disc ( see fig .",
    "it is evident from the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that we observe this trend in our simulation results as well .",
    "we obtain more insight into our results by exploring the low - energy conformations of a very flexible uniformly - charged shell where the elastic energy can be neglected in comparison with the coulomb energy .",
    "equilibrium shapes of such a shell will correspond to the minimum of the total electrostatic energy . in eq .",
    ", taking the limit @xmath80 gives @xmath81 , which is the lowest possible value for the coulomb energy of a uniformly - charged shell .",
    "this limit corresponds to a disc - like spheroidal shell whose area approaches infinity .",
    "further , we check that when the enclosed volume is held fixed , the coulomb energy of a prolate spheroidal shell vanishes as well when the shell is stretched into a long and thin wire - like shape .",
    "thus , we obtain ( at least ) two distinct shell shapes that correspond to the state of lowest electrostatic energy .",
    "this result suggests that in our original model system , electrostatic interactions drive the transformation in the shell shape by favoring the deformation of sphere towards disc - like shapes , while the elastic energies compete with the coulomb energy to generate oblate - shaped ( ellipsoidal , disc - like ) structures of various eccentricities .",
    "it also appears that the elastic energy component of the free energy favors the formation of oblate shapes to prolate ones .",
    "the constraint of fixed enclosed volume is critical to the low - energy shell conformations obtained in our simulations . if instead of the volume",
    ", the shell surface area is fixed , we expect the gallery of lowest free - energy conformations to look different than fig .",
    "we check that under the constraint of fixed area , the coulomb energy of an oblate spheroidal shell is higher when its eccentricity increases , and the spherical shape corresponds to the conformation with the lowest coulomb energy among all oblate shapes . however , sphere is _ not _ the configuration that minimizes the shell electrostatic energy when prolate - shaped deformations are considered .",
    "we find that prolate spheroids of high eccentricities have lower coulomb energy than the sphere and the lowest - energy conformation for the area - constrained system is a prolate spheroidal shell with its major - axis length stretched to infinity .",
    "hence , for the area - constrained problem , we expect the competition between coulomb and elastic energies to give rise to different nonspherical shapes as ground - state solutions .    in our charged shell model , we assume that the counterions remain in the bulk and do not condense on the shell surface .",
    "however , in an experiment it is possible that a fraction of the counterions do condense and in that event it becomes important to analyze their effect on the observed shape transitions .",
    "we measure this effect qualitatively in the salt - free limit for the sphere - disc transition by employing the expression for the electrostatic energy of a uniformly - charged oblate shell in a two - state model of free and condensed counterions @xcite .",
    "we consider a spherically - shaped wigner - seitz ( ws ) cell of volume @xmath82 with a single shell of volume @xmath83 and surface charge @xmath70 placed at its center .",
    "we define the quantity @xmath84 as the shell volume fraction .",
    "the cell also contains @xmath85 counterions , each of charge @xmath86 to neutralize the shell charge .",
    "we separate the counterions into two distinct groups : free ions and condensed ions .",
    "free ions occupy the available space in the ws cell which in the dilute limit becomes the volume of the cell .",
    "the condensed counterions are restricted to have translational motion in a thin layer of volume @xmath87 surrounding the shell , where @xmath88 is the surface area of the oblate shell and @xmath89 is the gouy - chapman length that is chosen as the condensed - layer width . here",
    ", @xmath90 is the unrenormalized surface charge density .",
    "when a shell has a higher @xmath90 or the system is characterized by a longer @xmath91 , we expect the condensed - layer width to shrink owing to the enhanced counterion - shell attraction . our choice of @xmath92 as the layer thickness correctly reflects this behavior .",
    "as @xmath92 is a characteristic of the charged planar surface , our analysis is limited to the regime where @xmath92 is much smaller than the lengths of the major and minor semiaxis of the shell .",
    "we write the free energy ( in units of @xmath93 ) associated with the shell in the event of ion condensation as : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the fraction of counterions that condense and @xmath96 is the thermal de broglie wavelength . here",
    ", the first term is the electrostatic energy of the shell obtained from eq .   by replacing @xmath70 with the reduced charge @xmath97 , the next two terms stem from the entropic contribution of the @xmath98 condensed ions , and the last two terms correspond to the entropy of @xmath99 free counterions .",
    "@xmath100 can be considered as a function of two variables : eccentricity @xmath65 , which characterizes the shape of the shell , and condensate fraction @xmath95 , which measures the renormalized charge on the shell . for a given @xmath65",
    ", we find the condensate fraction that extremizes the above free energy @xmath100 .",
    "using @xmath95 , we evaluate the equilibrium free energy difference , @xmath101 , between the free energy of the oblate shell and that of the sphere of the same volume ( see _ si text _ for details ) .",
    "we compute @xmath101 for the parameters associated with the transition recorded in the open blue circles of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and find that for all values of the volume fraction @xmath102 , @xmath101 becomes increasingly more negative as the eccentricity @xmath65 is raised , implying that the shape transitions from sphere to oblate spheroids are favored ( see fig .",

    ", we obtain @xmath103 while for large @xmath102 , we find the condensate fraction to be @xmath104 .",
    "regardless of the amount of condensation , we find the shell with higher eccentricity is preferred energetically .",
    "we next examine the variation of the renormalized electrostatic energy @xmath77 with @xmath65 for different @xmath102 values . for low and high values of the volume fraction , we find that @xmath77 is negative and decreases , just like @xmath101 , upon the increase of the eccentricity ( see fig .",
    "s5 ) . however , for some intermediate @xmath102 values , we observe that @xmath105 , that is the electrostatic energy increases as @xmath65 is raised , in sharp contrast to the free energy associated with the shell .",
    "this suggests that for some values of shell volume fractions , the shape transitions are expected to occur despite an increase in the electrostatic energy .",
    "we attribute the feasibility of such transitions to the gain in entropy by the ions as less number of ions condense when the shape is deformed from a sphere to an oblate .",
    "the main conclusions reached above remain unchanged when we repeat the two - state model analysis assuming that the shell is an equipotential surface . for all values of @xmath102",
    ", @xmath101 increasingly becomes more negative as the eccentricity @xmath65 is raised , implying that the shape transitions from sphere to oblate spheroids are favored ( see fig .",
    "thus , judging by the variation of @xmath101 determined by the above two - state model analysis , we conclude that the shape transitions from sphere to oblates of increasing eccentricity should be feasible in the event of ion condensation .",
    "however , due to the renormalization of the charge on the shell surface , it is likely that the specific parameter values ( for example , concentration strength , bending rigidity ) for which the shape transitions occur , will change .",
    "quantitative results can be obtained by including counterions explicitly in the simulations and taking into account the induced polarization charges on the shell surface in analyzing changes in shape .",

    "our results can also prove useful in the analysis of shape changes in charged emulsions or reverse micelle systems that form during the metal - extraction processes involved in the recovery of scarce rare - earth elements or cleaning of nuclear waste @xcite .",
    "in addition , our findings can aid in the development of theories explaining the properties of stretchable electronic materials such as dielectric elastomers where electrostatic field and deformation are intimately coupled @xcite .",
    "we generate the triangulation on the shell via the caspar and klug construction @xcite , which produces a lattice where each point has six neighbors with the exception of 12 five - coordinated vertices ( defects ) . due to the presence of these defects",
    ", the lattice has a non - vanishing initial stretching energy .",
    "we remove this residual strain by appropriately choosing rest lengths of the edges @xcite , leading to a vanishing stretching energy for the initial mesh .",
    "the defects , however , lead to slight variations in the surface charge density and local elastic and electrostatic energies . by choosing a large number of lattice points , the effect of these small deviations on the resulting shape transformations",
    "is minimized . in order to make sure that our results are independent of the particular triangulation",
    ", we perform simulations employing sufficient number of lattice points generated via different choices of caspar and klug constructions , obtaining similar results for all runs .    our lattice maintains the initial connectivity throughout the shape evolution .",
    "since each vertex carries a charge of the same sign , our discretized membrane is characterized with an inbuilt self - avoidance due to the mutual electrostatic repulsion between any pair of vertices .",
    "however , to ensure complete stability , we include an additional short - range , purely repulsive lennard - jones potential between two vertices , where each vertex is modeled as a hard sphere with radius chosen to be a fraction of the average edge length @xmath66 associated with the triangular lattice .",
    "we use molecular dynamics ( md ) method to minimize the free energy @xmath106 which requires the analytical expressions for the gradients of @xmath106 with respect to the vertex positions . evaluating the gradient of the bending energy term",
    "is relatively difficult and we show this calculation in the _",
    "si text_. our simulations start from a spherical shell with a nearly homogeneous surface distribution of local elastic and electrostatic energies .",
    "slight deviations in the energies arise from the presence of five - coordinated vertices which are the result of using the aforementioned triangulation of the shell surface .",
    "we assign the vertices a kinetic energy @xmath107 , and direct their motion according to the forces derived from @xmath0 , where the latter plays the role of the potential energy .",
    "we thus obtain the lagrangian @xmath108 , from which we derive the equations of motion for the vertices : @xmath109 . here , @xmath110 is a mass term associated with the vertices which determines the choice of the simulation timestep .",
    "these equations of motion , which form the basis of the md simulation of the vertices , are appropriately augmented to preserve the constraint of fixed total volume .",
    "we achieve this via the shake - rattle routine @xcite of implementing constraints that guarantees the conservation of shell volume at each simulation step . finally , in order to arrive at the shape that corresponds to the minimum of the energy landscape we couple the md scheme with simulated annealing .",
    "we associate a ( fictitious ) temperature with the kinetic energy of the vertices and employ a nose - hoover thermostat to set it .",
    "this temperature is not the physical temperature , it is merely a parameter we employ to control the annealing process .",
    "we reduce this temperature at periodic intervals so as to arrive at the lowest point of the potential energy associated with the md lagrangian , thus reaching the minimum of the free energy @xmath106 .",
