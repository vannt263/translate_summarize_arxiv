    "damage processes are usually highly nonlinear phenomena and their mathematical investigation is topic of many recent contributions in applied analysis .",
    "one modeling approach uses the phase - field method where a `` smooth '' variable is introduced . in the simplest case",
    "this variable is a scalar function and describes the local accumulation of damage in the body and the transition between the damaged and the undamaged material states .",
    "the popularity of phase - field models have increased in the last two decades in various fields of applied mathematics , physics and engineering sciences , see @xcite .",
    "they are used to predict the micro - structure and morphological evolution of two or more different phases and their mixture . specifically in damage mechanics they promise an accurate modeling and are powerful techniques in prediction of material behavior .",
    "for instance physical laws such as griffith - type criteria for crack propagation could be encoded into a pde / inclusion system and the crack paths need not to be known a priori .    despite theses advantages",
    "the mathematical treatment of the resulting systems is challenging for different reasons : first of all the evolution law for the damage process contains a difficult type of nonlinear ( coupling ) term , a nonlinear operator acting on the time - derivative of the evolution variable and , depending on the type of model , even constraints on the state and/or its time - derivative .",
    "secondly , damage processes are usually coupled with a model for elasticity where the material stiffness depends on the damage variable . in recent works",
    "this type of system has also been coupled with further processes such as heat conduction @xcite , phase separation @xcite , chemical reactions @xcite , and plasticity @xcite .    in engineering problems",
    "one is interested in prediction and even more relevant in control or manipulation of damage evolution in order to prevent , for instance , complete failure of a structural component , see @xcite for some examples and references .",
    "our main goal in this work is to provide a mathematical basis for optimal control problems of a time - continuous damage model including a first - order optimality system which has not been accomplished so far to the best knowledge of the authors .",
    "to state our problem let us fix an open , bounded and smooth domain @xmath0 with @xmath1 where the material is located in the reference configuration and let @xmath2 be a final time . furthermore let @xmath3 be the boundary to @xmath4 and @xmath5 the outward unit normal .",
    "we put @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we investigate the following optimal control problem : @xmath8 in the above problem the banach space @xmath9 is endowed with its natural norm @xmath10 .",
    "the box constraints @xmath11 satisfy @xmath12 a.e . in @xmath13 .",
    "moreover @xmath14 is a given target function and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are some prescribed positive constants .    the coupled pde system - with its initial - boundary conditions - models the lower lever problem and consists of the momentum balance equation ( according to the kelvin - voigt rheology ) and a parabolic equation which governs the evolution of a phase - field variable @xmath18 .",
    "the displacement field is denoted by @xmath19 and the variable @xmath18 is usually interpreted in relation with the density of micro - defects and therefore influences the material stiffness @xmath20 which is considered as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "moreover the external volume forces are specified by @xmath21 , the external surface forces by @xmath22 , the linearized strain tensor by @xmath23 and the stress tensor by @xmath24 .",
    "the first summand of @xmath25 contains the elastic contribution whereas the second summand models viscous effects .",
    "the coefficient @xmath26 designates the fourth - order damage - dependent stiffness tensor and @xmath27 the ( damage independent ) viscosity tensor . for a mechanical motivation of system - by means of balance laws and constitutive relations",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "global - in - time well - posedness of strong solutions of the state system - in 2d and existence of optimal controls for * ( cp ) * have been established in @xcite .",
    "for further existence , uniqueness and vanishing viscosity results for viscous and rate - independent damage models by making use of higher - order laplacians we refer to the work @xcite . besides these results necessary optimality conditions for * ( cp ) * have been left open and are the topic of the present paper .",
    "our main result is stated in theorem [ theorem : main ] which contains necessary conditions of first - order for minimizers of * ( cp)*. we remark that in this contribution we do not include the sub - differential @xmath28}(\\chi_t)$ ] in the damage law and use @xmath29 instead . on the one hand",
    "the incorporation of @xmath28}(\\chi_t)$ ] in the lower lever problem seems currently out of reach for necessary optimality conditions to * ( cp ) * and , on the other hand , could be approximated by @xmath29 .",
    "the nonlinear function @xmath30 is assumed to be monotonically increasing with certain properties that will be fixed in the next section .",
    "in particular @xmath30 may stem from a regularization process of the subdifferential of the indicator function @xmath31}$ ] ( e.g. yosida- or @xmath32-approximations , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) ) which models the so - called irreversibility condition as done in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , to the author s best knowledge , a nonlinearity such as @xmath29 has not yet been considered in the optimal control literature .",
    "the occurrence of the time - derivative of @xmath18 in the @xmath30-nonlinearity leads to the difficult integral term @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 denotes a test - function , @xmath35 an adjoint variable ) in the adjoint system .",
    "we propose a very weak formulation and prove an existence result for the adjoint system . to this end",
    "we will consider regularizations and derive a priori estimates by testing the system with , roughly speaking , time - integrated versions of the adjoint variables ( see and lemma [ lemmma : adjpq ] ) .",
    "a limit passage eventually yields very weak solutions to the adjoint system .",
    "let us put our work into perspective .",
    "in contrast to modeling and analytical aspects of damage models the mathematical literature concerning associated optimal control is rather scarce . beside the work",
    "@xcite we refer to @xcite as well as to the recent preprint @xcite for optimality systems of time - discretized and regularized damage phase - field models which follow the approach `` first time - discretize then optimize '' . a general framework for shape optimization problems in context with semi - linear variational inequalities and , as an application ,",
    "optimality systems for time - discretized damage models are explored in @xcite .",
    "we also point to the work @xcite for existence of optimal controls for a time - continuous degenerating damage model in terms of an obstacle problem where the irreversibility condition has been dropped . furthermore and in opposition to a phase - field approach",

    "these intermediate results are summarized in proposition [ prop : weakdiff ] , proposition [ prop : uniquelin ] and proposition [ prop : strongdiff ] . at the end of this section",

    "however we do not require @xmath67 or @xmath68 to be bounded . in order to avoid confusion",
