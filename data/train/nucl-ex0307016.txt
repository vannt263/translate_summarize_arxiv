    "a study of the 1 gev / c@xmath8 mass range is motivated by the continuing discussion on the nature of the scalar resonances @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which have been interpreted as exotic four quark states  @xcite , conventional @xmath9 states  @xcite or molecular like @xmath10 bound state  @xcite .",
    "+ within the framework of the jlich meson exchange model for @xmath11  @xcite and @xmath12 scattering the @xmath10 interaction dominated by vector meson exchange gives rise to a @xmath10 bound state identified with the @xmath1 in the isoscalar sector , while the isovector @xmath2 is concluded to be a dynamically generated threshold effect  @xcite . both shape and absolute scale of @xmath13 transitions",
    "turn out to depend crucially on the strength of the @xmath10 interaction , which , in turn is prerequisite of a @xmath10 bound state interpretation of the @xmath1 .",
    "although the @xmath14 decay mode of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is rather weak in comparison to the dominant @xmath15 and @xmath5 decay channels  @xcite , even a new theoretical analysis based on the chiral approach can not account for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 if the @xmath10 channel is not introduced additionally to the @xmath15 and @xmath5 interaction  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the @xmath4 and @xmath14 interaction  @xcite showed that f@xmath16 corresponds to poles of three rieman - sheets which appears physically as an object with a decay width of about 400  mev and a narrow peak width of about 50  mev .",
    "the same parameters of the f@xmath16 were found by utilizing a unitarized quark model , according to which f@xmath16 was interpreted as a @xmath17 state with a large admixture of @xmath14 virtual state  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the scalar resonances was also thoroughly studied by means of a coupled channel analysis considering @xmath4 , @xmath14 and @xmath18 meson  meson scattering  @xcite .",
    "decreasing gradually the interchannel coupling constants it was inferred that for some solutions the f@xmath16 corresponds to the @xmath14 bound state  @xcite at the limit of the fully uncoupled case .    in high energy experiments ,",
    "the @xmath19 meson is observed as a resonance in the system of two pions produced in the variety of hadro - production reactions  @xcite or in hadronic decays of heavier mesons  @xcite or the z@xmath20 boson  @xcite .",
    "these experiments study invariant masses of the created neutral ( ( @xmath21 )  @xcite and charged ( @xmath22 )  @xcite ) pion pairs .",
    "similarly , charged  @xcite and neutral @xmath23  @xcite mesons were observed as a clear signal in an invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath24 system .",
    "complementary to these approaches , which studied the interaction of @xmath4 , @xmath14 , and @xmath5 meson pairs , we investigate the possible manifestation of the mesons @xmath19 and/or @xmath23 as `` doorway states '' leading to meson production in proton - proton collisions , namely @xmath25 . by measuring the missing mass with respect to the pp - system we study the @xmath19 ",
    "@xmath23 system as a genuine particle produced in the proton - proton collisions . in section 3",
    "we report of the first experimental investigation , which concerns the close to threshold production of the broad neutral resonances via proton - proton collisions in the 1  gev / c@xmath8 mass range .",
    "moreover , we have studied the @xmath19 and @xmath23 mass range below the @xmath14 threshold , where they can decay into non - strange mesons only .",
    "it is obvious that for the excitation of a broad resonance the phrase `` close to threshold '' is not well defined and implies here that the beam momentum is such that masses just in the range of the resonance can be excited .",
    "this issue will be discussed in section  2 .    in a recent publication  @xcite the cosy-11",
    "collaboration presented data on the close - to - threshold @xmath26 production following the proton - proton interaction at the excess energy of q  =  17  mev .",
    "the obtained distribution of the missing mass to the p ",
    "p system is shown in figure  [ mm_kk_f0 ] .",
    "monte - carlo simulations demonstrate that the non - resonant @xmath26 production ( solid line ) is hardly distinguishable from the resonant @xmath27 reaction sequence ( dashed line )  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the statistics of the data was not sufficient to favour one of the two processes .",
    "the issue whether there is a chance to distinguish between @xmath14 pairs originating from the decay of genuine @xmath19/@xmath23 resonance and those produced by strong @xmath28 correlation is at present under theoretical investigation@xcite .",
    "since there exists no experimental information of the close to threshold total cross section for the production of the @xmath19 and @xmath29 mesons meson via the @xmath30 reaction  @xcite ] , before the presentation of the cosy-11 measurement , we will estimate an expected order of magnitude for the considered values at the excess energy of q  =  5  mev at which theoretical predictions for the @xmath31 production are available  @xcite .",
    "the calculation , based upon the one - pion exchange model and the breit - wigner prescription for the @xmath19 resonance , shows that the production of a @xmath32 pair through the @xmath19 resonance ( @xmath27 ) contributes at q  =  5  mev , with respect to the @xmath26 threshold , by a factor of at least 20 less than the non - resonant creation . extrapolating the measured cross sections of the @xmath33 reaction  @xcite to q",
    "=  5  mev one obtains the value of 0.08  nb . thus combining the above information and additionally taking into account that the branching ratio of @xmath19 meson decay into @xmath26 is about 2  @xmath34  @xcite",
    ", one expects that very close to threshold at q  =  5  mev ( with respect to the @xmath35 final state ) the @xmath19 meson should be produced with a cross section in the order of 0.08  nb  @xmath36  50  /  20  =  0.2  nb .",
    "however , the branching ratio of @xmath7 decay into @xmath14 pairs is not well established  @xcite and may be much smaller than the above assumed value of 2@xmath34 .",
    "naively one would expect it to be very small , since due to the energy conservation only a few per cent of the resonance can decay into strange particles and moreover only a fraction of that part will decay into a @xmath31 pair .    in case of the @xmath37 reaction",
    "the total cross section was estimated using an effective lagrangian approach taking into account the one - pion exchange mechanism and the production via t - channel exchanges with @xmath5 and @xmath38 mesons  @xcite .",
    "the assumption of the positive interference between s- and u - channel of the one - pion exchange results in the value of about  20  nb at q  =  5  mev , however , an exchange of heavier mesons was not taken into account .",
    "in addition it should be noted that a different choice of coupling constants and cut - off parameter @xmath39 would easily change the expected cross section by a factor of five in either direction .",
    "the above appraisement indicates that at a few  mev above the production threshold a total cross section for the @xmath40 reactions is expected to be in the order of 1  nb to 100  nb .",
    "the study of short - living ( broad ) particles in the @xmath41 reaction requires special care  @xcite when the energy in the center of mass is close to the sum of the masses of the two protons and the average mass of the meson .",
    "as already mentioned due to the broad mass distribution of such particles the notion of the reaction threshold is not well defined .",
    "it is naturally a matter of scale whether a given resonance is considered as a broad one .",
    "experimentally , by a broad resonance we define a particle with its full width @xmath42 at half maximum of the mass distribution ( spectral function ) being much larger than the experimental accuracy of the mass determination , or with a width such broad that the acceptance of the detection system changes significantly over the resonance mass range .",
    "both criteria apply for the measurements performed and discussed in the present contribution .",
    "+ in the following we will propose a definition of the total cross section as a function of the excess enery q = @xmath43 , which is valid also when q is small compared to the width @xmath42 of the produced meson .",
    "+     +     +    performing the measurement with the total centre - of - mass energy @xmath44 close to the sum of the average mass of the particles in the exit channel , different mass ranges of the broad particle are populated with different excess energies : q(m)=@xmath45 ( see figure  [ bw1]a ) .",
    "this implies that the observed mass distribution appears to be different from the one which would be determined at an excess energy much larger than the width of the broad meson . neglecting dynamical effects , in case of large @xmath44",
    "the mass distribution can be roughly approximated by the breit - wigner function , as shown in figure  [ bw1]a .",
    "the measurements of the @xmath46 reactions , reported here , have been performed by means of the cosy-11 detection system  @xcite . the thick solid line in figure",
    "[ bw1]b shows the expected missing mass distribution simulated for the total centre - of - mass energy @xmath44 equivalent to a maximal produced mass ( @xmath47 ) smaller than the average mass of the simulated meson .",
    "the shape of this curve results from convoluting the meson spectral density ( long - dashed line ) with both ( i ) the decrease of the phase space volume with decreasing excess energy q weighted by the proton - proton fsi enhancement factor ( short  dashed line ) and with ( ii ) the efficiency of the cosy-11 detection system for the simultaneous registration of the two outgoing protons from the @xmath41 reaction ( thin solid line ) .",
    "+ the number of observed events per mass bin @xmath48 can be written as : @xmath49 with l and e@xmath50 denoting the integrated luminosity and the efficiency of the cosy-11 detection system , respectively .",
    "as proven by extensive monte - carlo simulations , the cosy-11 efficiency is in a good approximation independent of the produced mass and depends on the excess energy q only .",
    "the cross section @xmath51 for the creation of a mass m is expressed by : @xmath52 where @xmath53 stands for the matrix element accounting for the production mechanism , and the last term @xmath54 denotes the spectral density of the produced meson with the average mass and width equal to @xmath55 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath56 and @xmath57 represent the phase space volume available to the outgoing particles and the proton - proton fsi enhancement factor , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath58(q ) combines all excess energy dependent factors and could be referred to as a primary production cross section of producing a mass bin of the resonance which is by a value of q smaller than the maximum kinematically available mass .",
    "it should be noted that all factors in equations  [ eq1 ] and  [ eq2 ] depend on the excess energy q only , except the spectral density which is a function of the created mass m. this means that the number of events per mass bin can be expressed as follows : @xmath59 scanning the resonance experimentally by changing the value of @xmath60 and keeping in the analysis a constant value of q allows to reproduce the mass distribution of the created meson , even without knowing exactly the energy dependence of the detection efficiency and other factors .",
    "note that if @xmath61 is within the range of the broad resonance ( see figure  [ bw1]a ) then not all parts of the resonance can be created .",
    "thus , it is not trivial from such a single measurement how to extract the total cross section .",
    "however , by scanning the resonance with different values of @xmath61 one can define the total cross section at a given excess energy q as an integral over the whole resonance region of the differential cross section @xmath62 keeping in the integration q as a constant , thus : @xmath63 please note that if the spectral density function is normalized to unity than @xmath64 is directly equal to the primary cross section @xmath65 .",
    "this can be inferred by substituting equation  [ eq3 ] in equation  [ eq5 ] .",
    "+ assuming that similar to the production process for pseudoscalar mesons the value of @xmath66 will be constant with small values of q  @xcite , one expects that the energy dependence of @xmath64 from equation  [ eq5 ] will be determined by the q - dependence of the phase space and the dominant proton - proton fsi .",
    "in the following we will present the analysis of the measurements which were primordially devoted to production studies of the @xmath68 meson in proton - proton collisions  @xcite .",
    "the experiment was performed at seven different beam momenta ( listed further down in table  [ tabelka ] ) .",
    "the maximum mass ( @xmath69 ) available in these experiments covered a range from 959.6  mev / c@xmath8 to 981.4  mev / c@xmath8 .",
    "this is the region below and close to the average mass of the f@xmath70(980 ) and a@xmath70(980 ) masses , and hence the signal from the production of these mesons should indeed influence the overall observed missing mass spectra .",
    "figure  [ miss_q14 ] presents one of the missing mass distributions extracted from the experimental data taken at a total centre - of - mass energy equivalent to the maximum created mass of m = 972  mev / c@xmath8 . + certainly the shape of the `` background '' below the clear @xmath68 peak differs from the shape of the missing mass distribution simulated for the breit - wigner like resonance shown as a thick solid line in figure  [ bw1]b .",
    "this is due to the fact that the experimental missing mass spectrum comprises also contributions from non - resonant multi  pion , @xmath5 and @xmath71 production .",
    "thus , taking also into account the well known yield originating from the @xmath68 production , one can generally extend equation  [ eq4 ] to : @xmath72 a mass bin corresponding to q  =  5  mev @xmath73 @xmath74  q with @xmath74  q  =  5  mev was chosen in the analysis for each of the seven measurements under investigation ( see as an example the shaded area in figure  [ miss_q14 ] ) .",
    "the number of events per this mass bin has been calculated for seven measurements and after the correction for the detection efficiency has been normalized to the corresponding integrated luminosity : @xmath75    simulated distributions for the case of the direct 2@xmath76 and 3@xmath76 creation are shown in figure  [ 3pi_2pi ] .",
    "one can observe that their shapes differ ( i ) from each other and ( ii ) again from the one determined experimentally .",
    "the latter discrepancy can be attributed at least qualitatively to contributions of the productions of the @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 mesons to the experimental spectrum .",
    "+ subsequently , if necessary , the well known values of @xmath77  @xcite were subtracted from the above defined @xmath78 : @xmath79 further , in order to account for the contribution from the multi - pion , @xmath5 and @xmath71 production we subtracted from each @xmath80 the value determined for the lowest measured energy .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ f0_cross]a , where the variable @xmath74 at the vertical axis reads : @xmath81 on the other hand , assuming changes of the cross section for the non - resonant multi - pion @xmath5 and @xmath71 production to be negligible the value of @xmath82 can be expressed as follows : @xmath83 values determined for @xmath74 are given in table  [ tabelka ] and also shown in figure  [ f0_cross]a .",
    "+    the curves in this figure represent calculations performed according to equation  [ eq10 ] approximating the spectral function sd@xmath84 by the breit - wigner distribution .",
    "the obtained result demonstrates that the data are sensitive to the average mass of the created meson or mesons but rather non - sensitive to the width of an assumed breit - wigner structure .",
    "the latest volume of the review of particle physics  @xcite shows that the parameters for @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons are very similar to each other : + @xmath85 mev ,  @xmath86  to  100  mev + @xmath87 mev ,  @xmath88  to  100  mev + and therefore we can not distiguish between these two resonances in a missing mass analysis from the proton  proton interaction .",
    "a fit to the resonance  like structure of figure  [ f0_cross]a results in values of : + @xmath89  mev and @xmath58  =  430@xmath90  nb and is nearly identical to the solid line in figure  [ f0_cross]a .",
    "the quality of the fit can be estimated from the @xmath91 distribution shown in figure  [ chi2vssigma ] .",
    "it is worth to note , that the obtained structure is in line with the measurements of the @xmath22 invariant mass distribution of the @xmath92 decay into @xmath93 system as shown in figure  [ f0_cross]b .",
    "it is rather well justified that the the total cross section of multi - pion and @xmath5 changes only insignficantly over the studied 22  mev excess energy range since the present measurements were performed some 560  mev and 300  mev above the 3@xmath76 and @xmath5 thresholds .",
    "still , it can not be excluded that the variations of @xmath74 are due to the growth of an unknown cross section for @xmath71 production since in this case the excess energy change from 42 to 64  mev .",
    "therefore the determined value of the total cross sections for @xmath23/@xmath19 resonances can only be treated as an upper limit .",
    "for the example of the production of the f@xmath70(980 ) and/or a@xmath70(980 ) mesons we discuss the notion of the reaction threshold in case of broad resonances where the available phase space volume for a given mass bin changes significantly .",
    "ansatz of equation  [ eq2 ] leads to a simple definition of the differential  - and total cross section also in the case of the close - to - threshold production of a broad resonance .",
    "the performed measurements of the @xmath46 reaction at seven beam momenta close to the threshold of @xmath7 and @xmath6 mesons revealed an enhancement in the missing mass spectrum .",
    "if the observed structure were due to the production of the object possessing a breit - wigner form its total cross section introduced in equation  [ eq5 ] would be equal to about 430  nb at excess energy of q  =  5  mev .",
    "however , due to the unknow influence of the @xmath71 production we can treat this value only as an estimation of an upper limit for the production of @xmath7 and @xmath6 meson via the @xmath94 reaction . here",
    "we would like to stress that this is the first experimental investigation utilizing a missing mass techniques of the production of these scalar resonances close to the kinematical threshold .",
    "the determined upper limit of the total cross section is much larger than expected from existing theoretical estimations , which however take into account only a part of the possible production mechanisms . in case of @xmath7 ,",
    "for example , one could consider also a production via an excitation of baryonic resonances .",
    "pdg  @xcite reports a few @xmath95 resonances around 1700 mev with widths of 50 - 250 mev , which decay predominantly into the @xmath96 channel .     + we would like to thank j.  a. oller for comments to the first version of the manuscript . + the work has been partly supported by the european community - access to research infrastructure action of the improving human potential programme as well as the international bro and the verbundforschung of the bmbf .",
