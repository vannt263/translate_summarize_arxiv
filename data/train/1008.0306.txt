    "the neutrino - oscillation hypothesis suggested by bruno pontecorvo  @xcite offers the most probable and promising explanation of the anomalies discovered in many experiments with solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "however the conventional quantum - mechanical ( qm ) theory of neutrino oscillations faces a number of methodological difficulties and paradoxes which have been widely discussed by many authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite and numerous references therein ) .",
    "it has been recognized that , remaining within the framework of quantum mechanics , some problems of the conventional theory can be resolved by using wave packets to describe the neutrino states and/or the states of the particles involved in the processes of neutrino production and detection . in this way it has been found ,",
    "e.g. , that neutrino oscillations vanish if the neutrinos propagate over the distances much larger than the coherence length ( for in - depth discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "a more radical approach to the problem is based on quantum field theory ( qft )  @xcite ; see also @xcite for further references . in this approach ,",
    "the sequential processes of neutrino production and detection are treated as a single process which can be described by the @xmath0-matrix formalism of qft .",
    "the peculiarity ( or better to say novelty ) of this approach is in the use of feynman diagrams with vertices separated by macroscopically large spacetime intervals .",
    "besides , as in the qm case , for the description of the asymptotically free `` in '' and `` out '' states one has to use wave packets rather than the ordinary ( in qft ) fock states with definite 4-momenta . in this framework ,",
    "the neutrinos appear as the propagators of the neutrino mass eigenfields , @xmath1 , connecting the macroscopically distant parts of the feynman diagram . in the new approach",
    ", there is no need in even mentioning the flavor neutrino states or fields , and the neutrino oscillation phenomenon is a reflection of the usual interference of the feynman diagrams with different @xmath1 s in the intermediate states .",
    "such treatment not only enables us to reproduce the standard qm formula for the flavor transition probability and obtain the pertinent qft corrections ( thus offering a potential possibility for an experimental verification of the theory ) but also impels us to re - examine the concept of neutrino flavor mixing .",
    "the authors of the mentioned pioneer papers do use ( explicitly or implicitly ) the noncovariant , usually gaussian wave packets , which are only applicable , as it will be shown in the next section , to nonrelativistic particles .",
    "however , in the reactions of neutrino production and detection taking part in the current neutrino oscillation experiments , relativistic particles are as a rule involved .",
    "moreover , by an appropriate lorentz boost , any particle can be made to be ultrarelativistic .",
    "therefore it is necessary to work out a relativistically covariant ( inertial frame - independent ) theory of wave packets applicable for the description of particles with arbitrary momenta .    in this paper",
    "we propose a simple covariant wave - packet theory ( section  [ sec : wavepackets_theory ] ) , which is then applied to the calculation of the interference of macroscopic diagrams with massive neutrino exchange ( section  [ sec : amplitude ] ) . we perform a statistical averaging of the probability ( the squared absolute value of the overall amplitude ) which leads to a rather general formula for the neutrino event rate in the detector ( section  [ sec : probability ] ) ; the conditions of applicability of the conventional qm formula for the flavor transition probability are also discussed . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarise the main results of the formalism .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix formalism of qft usually deals with one - particle fock states @xmath2 is the fock vacuum state ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the creation and annihilation operators of a particle with 3-momentum @xmath6 and spin projection @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the mass of the particle .",
    "the conventional ( anti)commutation relations hold : @xmath10 where the curly brackets denote a commutator ( for boson fields ) or anticommutator ( for fermion fields ) .",
    "the lorentz - invariant normalization of the states is therefore singular since @xmath11 let us define the wave - packet state localized in a spacetime point @xmath12 as a linear superposition of the one - particle states @xmath13 in which @xmath14 is a lorentz - invariant function .",
    "the last requirement implies that the proper lorentz transformation @xmath15 of the 4-vectors @xmath16 and @xmath12 , @xmath17 induces the following unitary transformation @xmath18 of the wave - packet state : latexmath:[\\ ] ] figure  [ fig : s_0(t , t ) ] shows the numerically evaluated 3d plot and 2d density plot of the function @xmath451 .    .",
    "the darker regions in the 2d plot correspond to the smaller values of @xmath452.,title=\"fig : \" ] . the darker regions in the 2d plot correspond to the smaller values of @xmath452.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "it can be proved that @xmath453 for any @xmath454 and @xmath455 for @xmath456 .",
    "this implies that the mean count rate in the detector , @xmath457 , decreases with a rise of the ratio @xmath458 .",
    "the reason is apparent : the number of events recorded in @xmath346 can not be larger then the number of neutrinos emitted from @xmath345 .",
    "a less obvious conclusion follows from the inequality @xmath459 valid for @xmath460 : the count rate is not suppressed at sufficiently large @xmath461 .",
    "clearly , this condition is over - fulfilled in the solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments but may be violated in the accelerator and perhaps reactor experiments .",
    "two dashed lines in the right panel of figure  [ fig : s_0(t , t ) ] separate the regions in which @xmath462 ( @xmath463 ) and @xmath464 ( @xmath465 ) .    in the particular case @xmath466 , which is of interest for accelerator experiments , the function @xmath467 converges to unity only at very large @xmath468 ( in practice for @xmath469 ) .",
    "thus , in order to set @xmath470 , the detector exposition time @xmath386 must be either sufficiently small in comparison with @xmath385 or ( at @xmath471 ) much larger than the characteristic time scale @xmath472 , where the minimum should be taken over the phase subspaces of the process , which are responsible for a significant contribution into the count rate .",
    "on the other hand , the observed strong dependence of the common suppression factor @xmath452 on its arguments at @xmath473 provides a potential possibility of an experimental estimation of the function @xmath329 ( or , rather , of its mean values within the above - mentioned phase subspaces ) , based on the measuring the count rate @xmath474 as a function of @xmath386 and @xmath385 ( at fixed @xmath441 ) , and comparing the data with the results of monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the optimal strategy of such an experiment should be a subject of a dedicated analysis .",
    "the profiles of the function @xmath448 calculated at various fixed values of @xmath475 are displayed in figure  [ fig : s(t , t,b ) ] .",
    "it appears that the shape of @xmath448 as a function of @xmath468 and @xmath476 becomes more and more complicated with an increase of @xmath475 . for @xmath477",
    ", @xmath448 rapidly oscillates around zero , highly suppressing the `` non - diagonal '' ( with @xmath478 ) terms in the factor @xmath479 .",
    "calculated at nine values of @xmath475 shown on the panels . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : s(t , t , b ) ] shows the dependence of the function @xmath480 on the parameter @xmath475 , evaluated at various fixed values of @xmath468 . at large @xmath468",
    ", this dependence has a quasi - periodic character superimposed by a fast decrease of @xmath480 with increasing @xmath475 . at very large @xmath468 ,",
    "the function @xmath480 becomes nearly independent of @xmath468 , slowly approaching the asymptotic behavior @xmath481     versus @xmath475 at fixed values of @xmath468 shown in legend .",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath480 at @xmath482 and finite @xmath475 is shown for comparison . ]    in this asymptotic regime , the `` probability '' takes on the form already known from the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , @xmath483 but with the essential difference that the factors @xmath417 and @xmath484 do depend ( through the functions @xmath329 and @xmath418 ) on the neutrino energy and momenta of the external wave packets .",
    "this dependence drastically affects the magnitude and shape of these factors if at least some of the wave packets have relativistic momenta ( that is always the case in the contemporary neutrino oscillation experiments ) .",
    "as follows from our analysis , for sufficiently small and/or hierarchically different momentum spreads @xmath175 , the functions @xmath417 and @xmath484 may vary in many orders of magnitude through their multidimensional domain .    the factors @xmath485 ( with @xmath486 )",
    "suppress the interference terms in at the distances exceeding the `` coherence length '' @xmath487 when the neutrino wave packets @xmath488 and @xmath289 are strongly separated in space ( due to the difference in their group velocities ) and no longer interfere .",
    "clearly @xmath489 in the plane - wave limit .    the suppression factors @xmath490 ( @xmath486 ) work in the opposite situation when the external packets in @xmath345 or @xmath346 ( or in both @xmath345 and @xmath346 ) are strongly delocalized ( in the plane - wave limit  uniformly distributed over the whole space ) .",
    "the gross dimension of the neutrino production and absorption regions in @xmath345 and @xmath346 is of the order of @xmath491 .",
    "the interference terms vanish if this scale is large compared to the `` interference length '' @xmath492 in other words , the qft approach predicts vanishing of neutrino oscillations in the plane - wave limit . in this limit , the flavour transition probability does not depend on @xmath441 , @xmath334 and neutrino masses and becomes @xmath493 thereby , a nontrivial interference of the diagrams with the intermediate neutrinos of different masses is only possible if @xmath494 .",
    "our analysis of the generic subprocesses @xmath495 , @xmath496 and @xmath497 shows that @xmath494 if in both vertices of the macrodiagram describing the process there are _ at least two _ interacting wave packets @xmath154 ( no matter in or out ) with @xmath158 .",
    "the same requirement unavoidably leads to the vanishing of the non - diagonal terms , when the mean distance between @xmath345 and @xmath346 becomes large enough in comparison with the coherence lengths @xmath498 . as a result",
    ", the range of applicability of the standard qm formula for the neutrino oscillations probability is limited by rather restrictive conditions , @xmath499 in which the angle brackets symbolize an averaging over the phase subspace of the process which provides the main contribution into the measured count rate .",
    "we recall that the conditions , as well as the relation , were obtained under a number of assumptions and simplifications , which are not necessarily adequate to fully represent the real - life experimental conditions .",
    "our consideration suggests that in the analysis and interpretation of real data , one should take into account not only the conditions , but also the operating times of the source and detector , their geometry and dimensions , explicit form of the distribution functions of in packets and other technical details .",
    "in this paper we have considered a covariant theory of wave packets in which the free field states are constructed as superpositions of one - particle fock states and are reduced to the fock states in the plane - wave limit .",
    "the mean momentum and effective spatial volume of such a wave packet are exact integrals of motion , in spite of the natural dispersion of the packet with time .",
    "the mean position of the packet evolves along the classical trajectory . as a simplest model ,",
    "satisfying all requirements of the formalism , we have studied relativistic gaussian packets ( rgp ) .",
    "the conditions are found which allow one to neglect the spreading of rgp ( crgp approximation ) and use the latter for description of the asymptotically free particle states in the @xmath0-matrix formalism of qft .",
    "the formalism has been implemented for the calculation of feynman diagrams with massive neutrino exchange between two macroscopically separated vertices and with the wave packets as external legs . as a typical generic example",
    ", we have studied the amplitude of a lepton flavor violating process or rather a class of the processes with production of the two charged leptons @xmath500 and @xmath430 in the distant parts of the macrodiagram .",
    "the amplitude is proportional to the sum of the products of the matrix elements describing the subprocesses of neutrino creation and absorption and the factor @xmath501 , which can be treated as a spherical wave of neutrino @xmath254 with a mass @xmath256 .",
    "the factor @xmath289 turns to be of the same form as the generic crgp wavefunction , but its `` dispersion '' is a relativistic - invariant function of the neutrino energy @xmath334 and momenta of external wave packets @xmath320 . as a common multiplier , the amplitude contains a suppression factor , arising due to the incomplete spacetime overlap of the external wave packets and , in addition , two non - singular factors , responsible for an approximate energy - momentum conservation in the vertices of the macrodiagram .",
    "experimental detection of the flavor - violating process would provide a firm indication of the incompleteness of the standard model , and a detailed measurement of its probability would be an important source of information on the neutrino mixing parameters and squared - mass splittings .",
    "a lorentz - invariant formula for the probability of the process has been obtained .",
    "a macroscopic averaging of this probability leads to an experimentally measurable quantity ",
    "the differential number of events represented , after several simplifications , by a multidimensional integral of the product of three factors , see .",
    "the factors @xmath401 and @xmath409 are respectively related , but not identical , to the differential flux density ( energy spectrum ) of massless neutrinos from the source and to the differential cross section of the neutrino - detector interactions .",
    "the function @xmath415 is answerable for the neutrino flavor transitions .",
    "but in general this quantity does not have the properties of a probability , because it involves the decoherence factors dependent on the phase space variables @xmath334 and @xmath320 and on the masses and momentum spreads of the external wave packets , including the packets of the leptons @xmath502 and @xmath503 .    within a simple model for the distribution functions of in packets in the source and detector ,",
    "the magnitude of the common suppression factor @xmath504 in @xmath415 is determined by the operating times of the source ( @xmath385 ) and detector ( @xmath386 ) , and by the spacetime width of the neutrino wave packet @xmath505 , where @xmath329 is a function of @xmath334 and @xmath320 .",
    "the suppression is small if @xmath506 or @xmath507 . in the opposite case , the strong dependence of @xmath504 on the parameters @xmath385 and @xmath386 provides a potential possibility of _ measuring _ an average value of the function @xmath329 in a special - purpose accelerator experiment , which allows us to variate these parameters ( or at least one of them ) .",
    "such a measurement , even if rather rough , would be useful in design and data - handling of future precision experiments with neutrino factories , @xmath421-beams and super - beams .",
    "the non - diagonal decoherence factors @xmath416 ( @xmath486 ) show in general a very involved behavior . in an asymptotic regime , @xmath508 ,",
    "these factors cease to depend on @xmath385 and @xmath386 but continue to strongly suppress the `` oscillation '' terms in @xmath415 .",
    "the conditions have been found at which the decoherence effects are small and the standard qm formula for the neutrino flavour transition probability is applicable .",
