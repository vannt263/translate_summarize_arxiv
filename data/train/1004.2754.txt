    "classical differential geometry is on the study of curved spaces and shapes , in which the time in general does not play a role .",
    "however , in the last few decades , mathematicians have made great strides in understanding shapes that evolve in time .",
    "there are many processes by which a curve or surface or manifold can evolve , among them two successful examples are the mean curvature flow and the ricci flow . for the ricci flow , there are many deep and outstanding works , for example , it can be used to successfully solve the poincar@xmath0 conjecture and geometrization conjectures . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the mean curvature flow .",
    "it is well known that the mean curvature flow is related on the motion of surfaces or manifolds .",
    "much more well - known motion of surfaces are those equating the velocity @xmath1 with some scalar multiple of the normal of the surface .",
    "the scalar can be the curvature , mean curvature or the inverse of the mean curvature with suitable sign attached .",
    "this is the traditional mean curvature flow . for the traditional mean curvature flow ,",
    "a beautiful theory has been developed by hamilton , huisken and other researchers ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and some important applications have been obtained , for example , huisken and ilmanen developed a theory of weak solutions of the inverse mean curvature flow and used it to prove successfully the riemannian penrose inequality ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a natural problem is as follows : in the above argument if we replace the velocity @xmath1 by the acceleration @xmath2 , what happens ?",
    "in fact , yau in @xcite has suggested the following equation related to a vibrating membrane or the motion of a surface @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mean curvature and the @xmath5 is the unit inner normal vector of the surface , and pointed out that very little about the global time behavior of the hypersurfaces ( see page 242 in @xcite ) . in deed , according to the authors knowledge , up to now only a few of the results on this aspect have been known : a hyperbolic theory for the evolution of the plane curves has been developed by gurtin and podio - guidugli @xcite , and some applications to the crystal interfaces have been obtained ( see @xcite ) .",
    "here we would like to point out that the traditional mean curvature flow equation is parabolic , however the equation ( 1.1 ) is hyperbolic ( see section 2 for the details ) .",
    "therefore , in this sense , we name the equation ( 1.1 ) as the hyperbolic version of mean curvature flow , or _",
    "hyperbolic mean curvature flow_. analogous to our recent work @xcite , in which we introduced and studied the hyperbolic version of the ricci flow  the hyperbolic geometric flow , in this paper we will investigate the hyperbolic mean curvature flow .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the hyperbolic mean curvature flow and give the short - time existence theorem . in section 3 ,",
    "we construct some exact solutions to the hyperbolic mean curvature flow , these solutions play an important role in applied fields .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the study on the nonlinear stability of the hyperbolic mean curvature flow defined on the euclidean space with the dimension larger than 4 . in section 5",
    ", we derive the nonlinear wave equations satisfied by some geometric quantities of the hypersurface @xmath6 , these equations show the wave character of the curvatures . in section 6 , we illustrate the relations between the hyperbolic mean curvature flow and the equations for extremal surfaces in the minkowski space @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be an @xmath9-dimensional smooth manifold and @xmath10 be a one - parameter family of smooth hypersuface immersions in @xmath11 we say that it is a solution of the hyperbolic mean curvature flow if @xmath12where @xmath13 is the mean curvature of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the unit inner normal vector on @xmath16    let @xmath17 and @xmath18 be the induced metric and the second fundamental form on @xmath8 in a local coordinate system @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "thus , the mean curvature @xmath13 reads @xmath20 recall that the gauss - weingarten relations @xmath21 thus , we have @xmath22so the hyperbolic mean curvature flow equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) can be equivalently rewritten as @xmath23 noting @xmath24 we get @xmath25 it is easy to see that the equation ( [ 2.3 ] ) is not strictly hyperbolic .",
    "therefore , instead of considering the equation ( [ 2.3 ] ) we will follow a trick of deturck @xcite by modifying the flow through a diffeomorphism of @xmath8 , under which ( 2.3 ) turns out to be strictly hyperbolic , so that we can apply the standard theory of hyperbolic equations .",
    "suppose @xmath26 is a solution of the equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) ( equivalently , ( [ 2.2 ] ) ) and @xmath27 is a family of diffeomorphisms of @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the pull - back operator of @xmath30 we now want to find the evolution equation for the metric @xmath31    denote @xmath32 in local coordinates , and define @xmath33 by the following initial value problem @xmath34where @xmath35 is the connection corresponding to the initial metric @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath37the initial value problem ( [ 2.4 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath38 obviously , ( [ 2.5 ] ) is an initial value problem for a strictly hyperbolic system .    on the other hand , noting @xmath39 we have @xmath40 by the standard theory of hyperbolic equations ( see @xcite ) , we have the following result .    [ t1 ] * ( local existences and uniqueness ) * let @xmath8 be an n - dimensional smooth compact manifold , and @xmath41 be a smooth hypersuface immersion of @xmath8 into @xmath11 then there exists a constant @xmath42 such that the initial value problem latexmath:[\\[\\label{2.6}\\begin{cases } \\dfrac{\\partial^2 } { \\partial t^2}x(x , t)=h(x , t)\\vec n(x , t),\\\\ x\\big |_{t=0}=x_0(x ) , ~~\\dfrac{\\partial x}{\\partial t}(x , t)\\big    @xmath14 on @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a smooth vector - valued function on @xmath46",
    "in order to understand further the hyperbolic mean curvature flow , in this section we investigate some exact solutions .",
    "these exact solutions play an important role in applied fields .",
    "to do so , we first consider the following initial value problem for an ordinary differential equation @xmath47 for this initial value problem , we have the following lemma .    for arbitrary initial data",
    "@xmath48 , if the initial velocity @xmath49 , then the solution @xmath50 decreases and attains its zero point at time @xmath51 ( in particular , when @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 ) ; if the initial velocity is positive , then the solution @xmath54 increases first and then decreases and attains its zero point in a finite time @xmath51 .",
    "*  the proof is similar to the arguments in @xcite .",
    "the following discussion is divided into two cases .",
    "* case * @xmath55 the initial velocity is nonpositive , i.e. , @xmath56    we argue by contradiction .",
    "let us assume that @xmath57 for all time @xmath58 then @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath58 hence there exists a time @xmath51 such that @xmath61 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this is a contradiction .",
    "moreover , for the case @xmath62 we can derive the explicit expression for @xmath51 according to the equation ( [ 3.1 ] ) .",
    "multiplying both side of @xmath63 by @xmath64 integrating , applying the initial condition @xmath65 and @xmath61 , integrating once again yields@xmath66 where @xmath67 thus we obtain @xmath68    ( 328,164 ) ( 22.0,112.0)(22.0,112.0)(23.43,111.98)(24.84,111.95)(26.27,111.91)(27.66,111.86)(29.06,111.79)(30.43,111.69)(31.81,111.58)(33.16,111.47 ) ( 33.16,111.47)(34.52,111.33)(35.86,111.18)(37.18,111.0)(38.5,110.8)(39.79,110.61)(41.09,110.38)(42.38,110.15)(43.65,109.9)(44.9,109.62 ) ( 44.9,109.62)(46.16,109.33)(47.4,109.02)(48.63,108.72)(49.84,108.37)(51.06,108.02)(52.26,107.66)(53.44,107.26)(54.62,106.87)(55.77,106.44 ) ( 55.77,106.44)(56.94,106.01)(58.08,105.56)(59.2,105.09)(60.33,104.62)(61.44,104.11)(62.55,103.59)(63.62,103.06)(64.7,102.51)(65.77,101.94 ) ( 65.77,101.94)(66.83,101.37)(67.87,100.76)(68.91,100.15)(69.94,99.51)(70.94,98.87)(71.95,98.2)(72.94,97.52)(73.93,96.83)(74.9,96.12 ) ( 74.9,96.12)(75.86,95.38)(76.8,94.63)(77.75,93.87)(78.66,93.09)(79.58,92.3)(80.48,91.5)(81.38,90.66)(82.26,89.81)(83.15,88.95 ) ( 83.15,88.95)(84.01,88.08)(84.86,87.19)(85.69,86.27)(86.52,85.34)(87.34,84.41)(88.16,83.44)(88.94,82.48)(89.73,81.48)(90.51,80.47 ) ( 90.51,80.47)(91.27,79.44)(92.04,78.41)(92.77,77.34)(93.51,76.27)(94.23,75.19)(94.94,74.08)(95.65,72.94)(96.33,71.81)(97.01,70.66 ) ( 97.01,70.66)(97.68,69.48)(98.33,68.3)(98.98,67.08)(99.62,65.87)(100.23,64.62)(100.86,63.37)(101.45,62.11)(102.05,60.81)(102.62,59.52 ) ( 102.62,59.52)(103.2,58.18)(103.76,56.86)(104.3,55.5)(104.84,54.13)(105.37,52.75)(105.9,51.34)(106.4,49.93)(106.9,48.49)(107.37,47.04 ) ( 107.37,47.04)(107.84,45.58)(108.31,44.09)(108.76,42.59)(109.2,41.06)(109.63,39.54)(110.05,37.99)(110.47,36.41)(110.87,34.84)(111.25,33.24 ) ( 111.25,33.24)(111.62,31.63)(111.98,30.0)(112.0,30.0 ) ( 194.0,88.0)(194.0,88.0)(195.14,90.25)(196.3,92.44)(197.47,94.58)(198.63,96.66)(199.77,98.68)(200.92,100.65)(202.08,102.55)(203.24,104.4 ) ( 203.24,104.4)(204.38,106.19)(205.53,107.94)(206.67,109.61)(207.83,111.23)(208.97,112.8)(210.11,114.3)(211.25,115.76)(212.39,117.15)(213.53,118.48 ) ( 213.53,118.48)(214.67,119.76)(215.82,120.98)(216.96,122.16)(218.08,123.26)(219.22,124.3)(220.36,125.3)(221.49,126.24)(222.61,127.11)(223.75,127.94 ) ( 223.75,127.94)(224.88,128.71)(226.0,129.41)(227.13,130.05)(228.25,130.66)(229.38,131.19)(230.5,131.66)(231.61,132.08)(232.74,132.44)(233.86,132.75 ) ( 233.86,132.75)(234.97,133.0)(236.08,133.19)(237.21,133.33)(238.32,133.41)(239.42,133.44)(240.55,133.39)(241.66,133.3)(242.77,133.14)(243.86,132.94 ) ( 243.86,132.94)(244.98,132.67)(246.08,132.36)(247.19,131.97)(248.29,131.53)(249.39,131.05)(250.48,130.5)(251.58,129.88)(252.69,129.22)(253.79,128.5 ) ( 253.79,128.5)(254.89,127.72)(255.98,126.88)(257.07,125.98)(258.17,125.02)(259.26,124.01)(260.35,122.95)(261.42,121.83)(262.51,120.65)(263.6,119.41 ) ( 263.6,119.41)(264.69,118.12)(265.77,116.76)(266.85,115.36)(267.94,113.88)(269.01,112.37)(270.1,110.79)(271.17,109.15)(272.25,107.45)(273.32,105.69 ) ( 273.32,105.69)(274.39,103.88)(275.48,102.02)(276.54,100.09)(277.61,98.12)(278.69,96.08)(279.76,93.98)(280.82,91.83)(281.89,89.62)(282.95,87.36 ) ( 282.95,87.36)(284.01,85.02)(285.07,82.65)(286.14,80.2)(287.2,77.7)(288.26,75.16)(289.32,72.55)(290.36,69.87)(291.42,67.16)(292.48,64.37 ) ( 292.48,64.37)(293.52,61.54)(294.58,58.63)(295.64,55.68)(296.69,52.66)(297.73,49.61)(298.77,46.47)(299.82,43.29)(300.86,40.06)(301.91,36.75 ) ( 301.91,36.75)(302.95,33.4)(303.98,30.0)(304.0,30.0 )    * case * @xmath55 the initial velocity is positive , i.e. , @xmath69    by ( [ 3.1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath70 then we have @xmath71 if @xmath54 increases for all time , i.e. , @xmath72 for all time @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 and @xmath75 thus , the curve @xmath76 can be bounded by two straight lines @xmath77 and @xmath78 . on the other hand , @xmath76 is a convex function since @xmath79 therefore , @xmath76 will change sign and becomes negative at certain finite time , this contradicts to the hypothesis that @xmath54 is always increasing .",
