    "the statistical hadronization model has proven to be a very effective tool in describing average particle multiplicities in high energy heavy ion reactions @xcite as well as in elementary particle reactions @xcite . on the other hand , in this model",
    "it would be possible to calculate also fluctuations of particle multiplicities once the status of the hadronizing sources ( _ clusters _ or _ fireballs _ ) in terms of volume , mass , momentum and charges were known .",
    "multiplicity and charge fluctuations have been indeed proposed to be a good discriminating tool between quark - gluon plasma and hadron gas @xcite provided that they survive the phase transition and the hadronic system freezes out in a non - equilibrium situation . however , in order to properly assess the discriminating power of such observables , one should firstly calculate fluctuations in a hadron gas by including all  trivial \" effects , such as conservation laws , quantum statistics , resonance decays , kinematical cuts etc .",
    "the effects of conservation laws on fluctuations in thermal ensembles have been firstly addressed , in the perspective of heavy ion collisions , in ref .",
    "more recently , it has been pointed out @xcite that in the canonical ensemble ( ce ) with exact conservation of charges , scaled second moment ( scaled variance ) of the multiplicity distribution of any particle does not converge to the corresponding gc value even in the thermodynamic limit , unlike the mean @xcite .",
    "this was fairly understood among experts in statistical mechanics @xcite , but probably it has been shown explicitely for the canonical relativistic gas for the first time in refs .",
    "further deviations from the gc limit were found in the case of exact energy and energy - momentum conservation in the microcanonical ensemble ( mce ) @xcite . since in a heavy ion collision conservation of charges",
    "must be fulfilled , the difference between ce and gce might have some impact on the estimated size of fluctuations in a statistical model .",
    "the calculations performed in these recent studies @xcite were mainly concerned with simplified cases , such as pion gas and pion - nucleon gas . in the present work ,",
    "we address the fluctuations in the _ general _ multi - species hadron gas including all resonances up to 1.8 gev mass and carrying three additive charges , that is baryon number @xmath0 , strangeness @xmath1 and electric charge @xmath2 , in the ce and mce .",
    "we give first a general formulation of the problem , and derive novel fluctuation formulae for the large volume limit in the ce and mce .",
    "we also discuss the problem of the inequivalence between gce and ce in the thermodynamic limit for scaled variance and we show that the ultimate reason thereof is the conceptual difference between additivity and extensivity @xcite : while particle multiplicities are additive and extensive in both gce and ce , variances are extensive ( i.e. proportional to the volume ) but they are non - additive in the ce , so that the scaled variance turns out to be a",

    "these values are not large enough to make an accurate numerical assessment of the thermodynamic limit .",

    "[ microfig1 ] ,  [ microfig2 ] , it can be realized that , unlike in the ce case , the scaled variance of negatives and charged is larger for primary than final hadrons especially at low energies and volumes .",

[ microfig1 ] .",
    "conversely , at final level , if all neutral particles decayed into one positive and one negative particle , there would always be one negative particle and the scaled variance would vanish .",
    "the non - vanishing value is owing to neutral stable particles , neutral particle decaying into stable neutral particles ( e.g. @xmath141 ) and negative particles giving rise to more than one negative particle in their decays .",
    "still , a strong reduction of scaled variance for final negatives is implied .",
    "a similar argument applies to charged particles .",
    "we have found that the thermodynamic limit of the scaled variance is different in different ensembles .",
    "this effect has been understood for a long time in statistical mechanics .",
    "though , from the previous derivations , the reader might have had the impression that this inequivalence between gce , ce and mce is a long - reaching consequence of a complicated analytical work not driven by a clear physical insight .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out @xcite that variances are qualitatively different from particle multiplicities in that their proportionality to the volume is not `` primordial '' but arises from the difference of two quantities whose leading term is @xmath142 ( see eq .  ( [ omega ] ) ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the behaviour of variance in the thermodynamic limit is determined by sub - leading terms in both @xmath5 and @xmath6 and different limits can be expected in different ensembles .",
    "we would like to point out here that the different behaviour in the thermodynamic limit can indeed be understood more simply and with more physical insight , by observing that , unlike particle multiplicities , variances are non - additive quantities in both the ce and mce .",
    "the conceptual difference between extensivity and additivity has been recently discussed in ref .",
    "an additive quantity @xmath143 is such that , if we split a general system into @xmath4 subsystem : @xmath144 on the other hand , an extensive quantity is such that the limit : @xmath145 has a non - vanishing and finite value . if a quantity is additive , it is also extensive except for some exceptional case @xcite .",
    "conversely , extensivity does _ not _ imply additivity .",
    "quantities which are extensive but not additive are defined as _ pseudo - extensive _ and their corresponding limit @xmath146 in eq .",
    "( [ intensive ] ) _ pseudo - intensive _",
    ". it can be shown quite easily that additive quantities have the same thermodynamic limit in all ensembles .",
    "in fact , if we split a ce or mce with a very large volume into a large number of @xmath4 parts with volume @xmath147 , each part is , by definition , a gce with the rest of the system acting as a reservoir ; this is just the way the gce is introduced in most statistical mechanics textbooks .",
    "consequently , any @xmath148 , where @xmath149 labels a subsystem in the ce or mce , has the same value as in the gce with volume @xmath147 in the limit @xmath150 . in other words , for any @xmath149 : @xmath151 if @xmath143 is additive , then : @xmath152 on the other hand , the left hand side of the previous expression also yields , according to ( [ limgce ] ) @xmath153 the comparison between ( [ tlim1 ] ) and ( [ tlim2 ] ) proves the equivalence between gce and ce , mce .",
    "simplest examples of additive quantities are the energy and entropy for weakly interacting systems and particle mean multiplicities .",
    "the previous argument does not apply to the variance @xmath154 of particle multiplicity distribution .",
    "in fact , if we split a ce or mce into @xmath4 subsystems , the variance of any particle multiplicity distribution is not additive , as conservation laws involve non - vanishing correlations between different subsystems even for very large @xmath4 .",
    "so : @xmath155 the equal sign would apply only if the subsystems were completely independent of each other , which is the case only in the gce .",
    "thus , if variances are not additive , their gce and ce thermodynamic limits may and , in general , will differ .",
    "still , the variance itself is extensive because the limit ( [ intensive ] ) yields a finite value in both ce and mce , as the leading behaviour is @xmath156 .    in conclusion , being non - additive ,",
    "the variance is a pseudo - extensive quantity and the scaled variance is thus pseudo - intensive . for such quantities , the thermodynamic limit in the ce and mce",
    "does not need to coincide with that in the gce .",

    ", it is very important to stress that the mere variance of a ratio of extensive quantities is an ill - defined observable in statistical mechanics because it is not a ( pseudo-)intensive quantity and vanishes in the thermodynamic limit simply because it is proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "considering for instance the ratio @xmath157 of particle multiplicities of two different species @xmath10 and @xmath158 we have : @xmath159 since @xmath160 and @xmath161 , one is left with an expression which decreases at least proportionally to @xmath40 .",
    "thus , in order to give a sensible fluctuation measure which does not vanish simply because the system gets larger , one should form some truly ( pseudo-)intensive variable .",
    "many such variables have been proposed to measure charge fluctuations in heavy ion collisions ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , e.g. @xmath162 @xcite , @xmath163 @xcite , and @xmath164 @xcite .",

    "note that in @xmath163 definition , in the first term the random variables are the numbers @xmath171 of particles with a given charge , whereas the random variable in the second term is the charge of each particle itself .",
    "these variables are indeed related to each other @xcite and to the scaled variances of charged particles . it is not difficult to realize that the first two in eq .",

    "being pseudo - intensive , they have different thermodynamic limits in the gce , ce and mce .",
    "therefore , much care is needed in comparing the measurements to the predictions of statistical mechanics because the effect of conservation laws is crucial in determining their values even for very large systems",
    ".    however , this comparison is in general difficult because of additional source of fluctuations which can not be disregarded .",
    "even if a statistical model framework would be essentially correct , there could be large fluctuations of thermodynamic parameters ( volume , temperature , baryon density etc . ) from event to event , which , being superimposed to the purely thermodynamic fluctuations , could swamp the thermodynamical fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , experimental measurements cover a limited kinematical window and this introduces a further complication",
    ".    that said , it can be interesting to study the difference between the fluctuations of charged particles in the canonical and grand - canonical ensemble . in this respect ,",
    "our monte - carlo method is especially suitable as it allows to predict the numerical values of the aforementioned variables taking into account all  trivial \" effects including quantum statistics and resonance decays .",
    "thus , we have calculated the values of these variables in the two ensembles at final hadron level for conditions relevant to heavy ion collisions at @xmath173 gev , i.e. @xmath174 mev , @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 @xmath130 by using monte - carlo simulations . in the ce ,",
    "the volume chosen was 200 @xmath137 , which is large enough to ensure in practice the reaching of the thermodynamic limit . in order to show the effect of a limited kinematic acceptance",
    ", we have also implemented a toy dynamical model , giving each primary generated particle ( according to thermal distributions ) a random longitudinal boost in rapidity uniformly between @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "though unrealistic , this model allows to understand the possible effect of measuring variables relevant to fluctuations over a finite rapidity window @xmath180 .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath163 , @xmath162 and @xmath181 are shown in figs .",
    "[ phiq ] ,  [ djeon ] ,  [ nudyn ] respectively .",
    "it can be seen that all of them are strongly affected by the dynamical boost @xmath179 and the acceptance window @xmath180 .",
    "also , a relative strong difference is seen between ce and gce . yet",
    ", we note that , at least for @xmath163 and @xmath181 their ce value converge to the gc one for small rapidity acceptance .",
    "this is not a trivial feature because such a behaviour is expected if we select a subsystem in _",
    "space _ and not in _ momentum space _ as we have actually done .",
    "in fact , this behaviour is not seen in @xmath162 ( see fig .  [ djeon ] ) .",
    "altogether , we can conclude that the spread of these variables is considerable and making a fairly accurate estimate of the theoretical expectation for a hadron gas in chemical equilibrium requires at least taking into account exact charges ( i.e. @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) conservation .",
    "we have studied the thermodynamic limits of fluctuations of particle multiplicities in the full ideal hadron - resonance gas in the canonical and microcanonical ensemble taking into account the exact conservation of three charges ( baryon number , strangeness , electric charge ) and energy .",
    "the inequivalence between these ensembles and the grand - canonical ensemble in this respect is clearly seen in our calculations , which have been carried out by means of two independent methods : asymptotic expansions of the partition functions , giving rise to analytical formulae for scaled variances in the thermodynamic limit , and a full monte - carlo simulation .",
    "excellent numerical agreement has been found between the two .",
    "the difference between the thermodynamic limits of the scaled variance in the mce , ce and gce ensembles has its roots in the non - additivity of the variance in the former two .",
    "in fact , we have shown that all additive quantities , like particle multiplicities , must have the same thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have finally discussed and calculated some variables used to measure charged particle fluctuations in the canonical and grand - canonical ensemble taking into account conservation laws and the decay of all resonances . it has been shown that their values is , in general , strongly affected by acceptance window and superimposed dynamical effects .",
    "generally , we want to find an asymptotic expansion of the complex @xmath182-dimensional integral : @xmath183 g({\\vec{w } } ) \\ ,   { { \\rm e}}^{\\nu f({\\vec{w}})},\\ ] ] for large values of the real parameter @xmath184 ; @xmath185 is a @xmath182-dimensional vector and @xmath186 a smoothly varying function along the paths of integration @xmath187 .",
    "as it is well known , with large values of @xmath184 , the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the small part of the path in the neighbourhood of the saddle point @xmath188 defined by @xmath189 in this neighbourhood , one may expand @xmath190 in taylor series up to second order as : @xmath191 according to the saddle - point or steepest - descent method @xcite , we choose a real integration variable @xmath192 for the path which is related to the original @xmath24 through : @xmath193 @xmath194 being a phase .",
    "if @xmath195 lies on the real axis and the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix are positive , as it is the case for canonical partition function , the steepest descent method prescribes that this phase ought to be @xmath196 if the so : @xmath197 this transformation corresponds to deform the original path into the line @xmath198 in the complex plane .",
    "since only a small segment around the saddle point contributes to the integral value , we can extend the integration in @xmath192 from @xmath199 to @xmath200 leaving it essentially unchanged . by plugging the transformation ( [ trans1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ inte ] ) and taking the expansion ( [ expa ] ) for @xmath49 , we can write : @xmath201 g({\\vec{w}}({\\vec{t } } ) ) \\ , { { \\rm e}}^{-\\frac{1}{2 } \\nu { \\vec{t}}^t { \\sf h } { \\vec{t}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is its hessian matrix of the function @xmath190 for @xmath202 .",
    "the smooth function @xmath186 is expanded into a taylor series around the saddle - point : @xmath203 where @xmath204 labels the sets of @xmath182 integers such that @xmath205 .",
    "thus eq .",

    "thus , there must be an orthogonal matrix @xmath98 such that : @xmath208 where @xmath209 are the hessian s eigenvalues . by defining @xmath210 , the integral ( [ single1 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as : @xmath211   { { \\rm e}}^{-\\frac{1}{2 } \\nu { \\vec{\\tau}}^t { \\sf h } ' { \\vec{\\tau } } } =    \\left[\\prod_{k=1}^d \\frac{1}{n_k ! } \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty }    { { \\mathrm d}}\\tau_k   \\left ( \\sum_{m=1}^d a_{mk } \\tau_m \\right)^{n_k } \\right ]   { { \\rm e}}^{-\\frac{1}{2 } \\nu \\sum_{k=1}^d h_k \\tau_k^2}\\ ] ] now we can use the well known expansion : @xmath212 where @xmath213 is a set of @xmath182 integers such that @xmath214 .",
    "therefore , the integral ( [ single1.5 ] ) turns to : @xmath215 and , by rescaling the variables @xmath216 : @xmath217 taking into account that @xmath218 and @xmath219 and using known formulae for the rightmost gaussian integrals above , we are led to the following final expression of the integral ( [ inte3 ] ) : @xmath220 where , by convention , @xmath221 and @xmath222 if @xmath4 is even . the eq .",
    "( [ intefinal ] ) is admittedly rather cumbersome , but it makes it clear that high order terms depend on increasing powers of @xmath223 , which are negligible for large values of @xmath184 .    yet , the expansion ( [ intefinal ] ) is not a full asymptotic series for @xmath224 because the function @xmath49 was expanded only at the second order . in order to estimate the corrections due to higher order terms in @xmath49 expansion , one defines a function @xmath225 such that : @xmath226 obviously : @xmath227 the series ( [ intefinal ] ) would turn into an exact asymptotic series provided that @xmath102 is replaced with @xmath228 $ ] .",
