    "three - dimensional voronoi tessellations provide a powerful method of subdividing space in random partitions and have been used in a variety of fields such as computational geometry and numerical computing ( see for instance @xcite and the references therein ) , data analysis and compression @xcite , geology @xcite , and molecular biology @xcite .",
    "however , in many experimental conditions it is not possible to directly observe the cells themselves , just their planar or linear sections : thus it is of interest to study the relationships between the geometric properties of three - dimensional structures and their lower dimensional sections @xcite .",
    "a basic result has been proved in @xcite : the intersection between an arbitrary but fixed plane and a spatial voronoi tessellation is not necessarily a planar voronoi tessellation .",
    "an analysis of some aspects of the sections of voronoi diagrams can be found in @xcite .",

    "a voronoi tessellation is said to be a poisson voronoi diagram ( pvd ) , denoted by @xmath5 , if the centers generating the cells are uniformly distributed . in the case of one - dimensional pvd , with average linear density @xmath6 ,",
    "a rigorous result can be derived , namely that the distribution of the lengths of the segments has the probability density function    @xmath7    or , by using the standardized variable @xmath8 @xcite ,    @xmath9    no analytical results are known for the distribution of the sizes of voronoi diagrams in 2d or 3d ; typically distributions of the surfaces or volumes of the voronoi cells are fitted with a @xmath10-parameter generalized gamma pdf of the standardized variable @xmath11 , @xcite , @xcite , @xmath12    it should be noted that from @xmath13 other , simpler , probability density functions can be derived , that have been also used to model empirical distributions of pvd : for instance , by setting @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the one - parameter distribution proposed in @xcite results in    @xmath16    with variance @xmath17    similarly , set @xmath18 , @xmath15 , where @xmath19 is the dimensionality of the cells : eq .",

    "to obtain analytical results for the distributions of the lengths and areas of @xmath23 , some simplifying hypothesis is needed : here the cells will be supposed to be spheres .",
    "this is , admittedly , a rather rough approximation , but , on the other hand , it makes all cuts of the same simple shape , i.e. circles , irrespective of the orientation of the cutting plane .",
    "as shown in the sequel , this approximation allows of deriving an analytical form for the distributions of the radii lengths and the areas of cell sections .",
    "let @xmath24 be the probability density function for the cell volumes , then the pdf @xmath25 for the lengths of their radii is given by @xmath26    the use of eq .",

    "the area of the irregular polygons has been obtained with the algorithm described in @xcite : briefly , each cut defines a two - dimensional grid and the polygons areas we measured by counting the number of points of the grid belonging to a given cell .",
    "as concerns the linear dimension , in our approximation the two - dimensional cells were considered circles and thus , for consistency , the radius @xmath31 of an irregular polygon was defined as @xmath73 that is @xmath31 is the radius of a circle with the same area of the polygon , @xmath74 . the empirical distribution of radii is shown in fig .",

    "in this paper analytical formulas have been provided which model the distributions of the lengths and areas of the planar sections of three - dimensional poisson voronoi diagrams : in particular , it has been shown that they are related to the meier @xmath0 function .    this finding is consistent with the analytical results presented in @xcite , where it is proved that nonlinear combinations of gamma variables , such as products or quotients , have distributions proportional , or closely related , to the meijer @xmath0 distribution .",
    "the analytical distributions @xmath54 and @xmath68 been compared with results of numerical simulations : in evaluating the differences between analytical and empirical distributions it must be kept in mind that the cells were approximated as spheres and that the distributions used here have no free parameters that can be adjusted to optimize the fit .",
    "the results obtained here may be useful for applications in stereology in that they allow of predicting the distributions of linear and planar measures of sections , given an arrangement of three - dimensional cells .",
    "this method can also have application to astrophysics , namely in the analysis of the spatial distributions of the voids between galaxies , that are experimentally measured as two - dimensional slices @xcite and that can be identified with two - dimensional cuts of a three - dimensional structure .",
