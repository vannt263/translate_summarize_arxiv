    "ever since the experimental discovery@xcite of superconductivity by jerome",
    "_ et al . , _ in 1980 in a bechgaard@xcite salt ( tmttf)@xmath1pf@xmath2 ( with a t@xmath3 of 1.2 k under a pressure of 6.5 kbar ) , search for new higher t@xmath3 molecular superconductors has been a vigorous field of research@xcite .",
    "a large number of molecular superconductors@xcite with varying degrees of dimensionality have been discovered since 1980 , and a continuing multidisciplinary search for new higher t@xmath3 molecular superconductors is currently underway .",
    "theoretical studies of a possibility of superconductivity in molecular conductors and conducting polymers have had a positive influence in the development of this field .",
    "indeed , littles@xcite prediction of high superconducting transition temperatures within an exciton mediated mechanism of superconductivity in a hypothetical conducting polymer chain ( with polarizable molecules periodically attached to the spine ) played a boosting role for this field@xcite . for a discussion on the future prospects for superconductivity in conducting polymers",
    "see heeger @xcite .",
    "one of the strategies in the search for higher t@xmath3 molecular superconductors continues to be to search for molecules with large electron-_intra_molecular vibration coupling ( emvc ) and to crystallize them with the hope that the solid will be metallic or can be made metallic by charge transfer from another molecule ( in charge - transfer salts ) and/or by application of pressure .",
    "if the material is metallic and if emvc is the pairing glue , large emvc implies a large t@xmath3 within the frame - work of bcs theory@xcite . in a molecular conductor , the phonon spectrum forms two distinct groups : high - frequency _ intra_molecular phonons and _ inter_molecular phonons which have relatively low frequencies ( @xmath4 @xmath5 in the currently known organic superconductors ) . where calculations are available@xcite , the emvc s are larger than the electron-_inter_molecular vibration coupling , though there are exceptions to this trend@xcite .",
    "but , when emvc s become large , there is a possibility of polaron formation@xcite , a possibility not included in the migdal - eliashberg@xcite extension of the bcs theory .",
    "if emvc is large enough to lead to small polaron formation , a possibility for superconductivity to arise is by the polaron pairing through the exchange of low frequency _",
    "inter_molecular phonons .",
    "recently we investigated@xcite this possibility in a simple model molecular conductor . in that work we considered molecular orbitals , overlaps of which on nearest neighbor ( nn ) molecules",
    "produces the conduction band , to have _ no orbital degeneracy_.    now , depending on the symmetry of the molecule , the molecular orbitals which participate in the band formation can be degenerate or non - degenerate .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the possibility of superconductivity in a three dimensional molecular conductor in which the molecular orbitals participating in the conduction band formation are doubly degenerate and emvc between electrons and a single _ intra_molecular vibration mode is large enough to lead to the formation of jahn - teller ( jt ) small polarons .",
    "this is the @xmath0 jt model and is the simplest jt system .",
    "molecules with tetragonal symmetry are examples of such a system .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce our model for the molecular conductor , perform a lang - firsov transformation on it to obtain the jt polaron hamiltonian . in sec .",
    "iii , a bcs - mean - field ( bcs - mf ) theory is presented which is applicable in the weak coupling regime of the effective attractive interaction between the jt small polarons . in sec .",
    "iv , we analyze the strong coupling bose regime .",
    "an insulating state obtained for the case of two electrons per site is discussed in sec .",
    "v. the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we employ the following model to study the @xmath0 jt polaron formation and their effective interactions : @xmath6 in the above @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the molecular site indices , @xmath10 ( = 1 , 2 ) is the orbital index of the two degenerate molecular orbitals , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) the hopping energy between similar orbitals on nn molecules , @xmath13 the molecular vibration frequency , @xmath14 the electron - phonon ( _ el - ph _ ) interaction energy , @xmath15 the mass , @xmath16 the coulomb interaction strength , and @xmath17 the number of sites .",
    "furthermore , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the destruction operators of electrons and phonons respectively , and @xmath20 .",
    "a chemical potential will be introduced later when we have to fix the electron density . in the appendix , using an argument given in ref.@xcite we show that , for @xmath21 , the @xmath22 jt model reduces to @xmath0 jt model . a detailed numerical study of polaron and bipolaron formation in @xmath22 jt model in one dimension and for the case of one and two electrons was recently published by shawish _ et.al._@xcite .",
    "our calculation proceeds along the following lines .",
    "first we apply a multi - band lang - firsov ( lf ) transformation@xcite which produces the jt small polarons , reduces the _",
    "intra_orbital coulomb repulsion , and increases the _ inter_orbital coulomb repulsion .",
    "we will argue that the _ intra_orbital polaron - polaron interaction can be attractive for realistic range of frequencies and _ el - ph _ coupling realizable in molecular conductors .",
    "this interaction then is the source of superconductivity in our model . in the next step ,",
    "we project out _ inter_orbital double occupancies employing a gutzwiller approximation@xcite method in the weak and strong coupling regimes of the attractive interaction to obtain effective hamiltonians in these regimes .",
    "these effective jt hamiltonians are used to study superconductivity in the weak - coupling bcs - mf and strong - coupling ( bose ) regimes .",
    "the superconducting transition temperatures obtained are then analyzed as a function of phonon frequency , _ el - ph _ interaction strength , coulomb repulsion strength , original band - width , and doping .",
    "we will also see that , for the case of two polarons per site , we obtain a novel insulating state with a polaron singlet occupying the lattice sites . for this paired polaron mott insulator",
    ", we show that one obtains a novel orbital density wave state ( odw ) for large and finite _ inter_orbital repulsion .",
    "we also point out a mapping of this odw sate to the ising model . from our analysis of the superconducting transition temperature in the bcs - mf regime and the bose regime",
    ", it will be shown that superconducting t@xmath3 up to 100 k is achievable for this mechanism .",
    "now we go to the details of the calculations .",
    "as stated , we apply a multi - band lf transformation to the @xmath7 .",
    "the transformation @xmath23 transforms @xmath7 into the polaron representation .",
    "lf is a unitary transformation with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is @xmath27 using this @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31\\,.\\ ] ] using the above operators , the transformed hamiltonian is @xmath32 where @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the above equations @xmath37 and @xmath38 the lf transformation produces three effects .",
    "the first is the polaronic band - width reduction , of course .",
    "the second and third effects are the enhancement of the _ inter_orbital coulomb repulsion and the reduction of the _ intra_orbital coulomb repulsion , respectively .",
    "these second and third effects have different origins : while the second has its origin in the jt nature of the system , the third is a small polaron effect . on phonon averaging@xcite of @xmath39 as usual , neglecting a constant coming from @xmath40 , one obtains @xmath41 where @xmath42 in which @xmath43\\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath44 .",
    "now , @xmath45 is the hamiltonian for a collection of jt small polarons and these polarons interact among themselves though in the _ intra _ and _ inter _ orbital interactions @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . at this stage",
    ", we demand that @xmath46 be an attractive interaction .",
    "this is very much realizable for the values of @xmath16 , @xmath14 , and @xmath13 in a range possible in molecular conductors .",
    "some idea about the range of @xmath16 , @xmath14 , and @xmath13 would be useful to get a better feel . the highest _",
    "intra_molecular vibration frequency is unlikely to exceed the frequency ( @xmath48 @xmath5 ) of the lightest molecule ( h@xmath1 , the hydrogen molecule ) . among the calculated values@xcite of @xmath14 ,",
    "the highest seems to be around @xmath49 mev ( obtained for a mode of frequency @xmath50 @xmath5 in benzene ) .",
    "practically all the existing molecular superconductors are built from the molecules tmtsf , bedt - ttf , dmit , dmet , bets , or c@xmath51 .",
    "this is arguably a small subset of already synthesizable molecules .",
    "then , it is quite possible that higher values of @xmath14 are realized in many molecules .",
    "as for @xmath16 , large and highly polarizable molecules can be expected to have small @xmath16 s . in the existing molecular superconductors",
    "@xcite , @xmath16 seems to be in a range around @xmath52 ev .",
    "we note that the @xmath16 is _ not _ for an isolated molecule , but for a molecule sitting on a lattice site in the solid so that @xmath16 includes the effects of polarization of molecules surrounding a given molecule and consequently is reduced from the @xmath16 value for the isolated molecule .",
    "now , if we tentatively fix an upper limit for @xmath14 around @xmath53 mev and keep the upper limit of @xmath13 as @xmath48 @xmath5 , it is not unreasonable to expect @xmath46 to be negative in a range of @xmath16 which obtains in molecular conductors",
    ". given the estimates of _ el - ph _ coupling to individual modes , this situation is very unlikely to be realized in the existing organic superconductors .",
    "but , that does not preclude its realizability in another important class of materials : the molecular conductors yet to be discovered . in our study , we assume that @xmath46 is negative .",
    "this attractive @xmath46 is then the origin of superconductivity in our theory . in the next two sections , we study superconductivity in the weak and strong coupling regimes of @xmath54 .",
    "the weak coupling regime of @xmath54 is the range of @xmath54 in which the superconducting t@xmath3 and the pair formation temperature are the same . in this section ,",
    "we project out _ inter_orbital double occupancies , using the gutzwiller approximation method , to obtain an effective hamiltonian in the weak coupling regime of @xmath54 and then study the superconductivity using a bcs - mf theory .",
    "the gutzwiller projection renormalizes @xmath55 and @xmath54 , and decouples the orbitals .",
    "first , we recall that the bare _ el - el _ repulsions [ in eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] are strongly renormalized [ eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) ] : while the _ inter_orbital repulsions have increased , the _ intra_orbital repulsion is suppressed to an extent that it has become attractive ( see the previous paragraph ) .",
    "the effect of @xmath47 is to strongly reduce the probability of polarons occupying different orbitals on a given site . on",
    "the other hand , @xmath54 ( now attractive ) increases the probability of two polarons ( with opposite spins ) occupying the same orbital on a given site .",
    "both these aspects have to be considered while doing the gutzwiller projection .",
    "we take , for simplicity , the @xmath47 to be infinity and completely project out the _ inter_orbital double occupancies .",
    "qualitatively one can see that projecting the _",
    "inter_orbital double occupancies reduces the polaron band - width ( through a density dependent function ) since it is energetically unfavorable for a polaron to hop from an orbital ( say 1 ) on a site to a target site where the orbital 2 is occupied .",
    "also , strong reduction of _ inter_orbital double occupancies increases the _",
    "intra_orbital double occupancies and consequently modifies the _ intra_orbital attraction .",
    "we do the _",
    "inter_orbital double occupancy projection in an approximate way .",
    "first consider the part @xmath56 of @xmath57 [ eq .",
    "we write the gutzwiller wave function @xmath58 as : @xmath59{|\\psi_{\\circ}\\rangle } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath60    for calculating the expectation value of @xmath61 and @xmath62 in @xmath58 , we use a simple intuitive method proposed by okabe@xcite . since the maximum number of polarons ( @xmath63 )",
    "a site can accommodate is four , there are sixteen possibilities for occupancy for finite @xmath47 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we take @xmath47 infinity limit for simplicity [ @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( 16 ) ] , and consequently the sixteen possibilities reduces to seven . in the paramagnetic case ( @xmath65 , the probability for a site to be vacant is",
    "@xmath66 $ ] and the probability for a site to be singly occupied is @xmath67 . here",
    "@xmath68 is the _",
    "intra_orbital double occupancy .",
    "then , considering the hopping process given in fig .",
    "1 , the gutzwiller band narrowing factor is @xmath69 ^ 2}{\\frac{n}{4}(1-\\frac{n}{4})}\\,,\\ ] ] where the numerator and the denominator corresponds to hopping in the presence and absence of _",
    "inter_orbital repulsion , respectively .",
    "the ground state energy for @xmath56 is @xmath70 where @xmath71 $ ] is the average kinetic energy per polaron , and is independent of the indices @xmath10 and @xmath72 .",
    "minimization of @xmath73 with respect to @xmath68 leads to the equation to determine @xmath68 for a given @xmath74 : @xmath75 for @xmath76 , the above equation implies that @xmath77 , which means that one of the orbitals on all the sites are occupied by a singlet . for a general value of @xmath74",
    ", one has to solve eq .",
    "( 20 ) to obtain the variation of @xmath68 as a function of @xmath74 .",
    "the optimized values of the band narrowing factor @xmath78 and the _ intra_orbital double occupancy ( @xmath79 ) as a function of @xmath74 are shown in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 , respectively . from the numerical results shown in the figures",
    ", we have @xmath80 and @xmath81 furthermore , it is clear that as @xmath82 , the polaron band - widths are narrowed and a mott insulator is obtained for @xmath76 .",
    "this mott insulator has a singlet in one of the orbitals on each lattice site .",
    "the properties and excitations of this insulator will be discussed separately in sect . v. next consider the term @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( 13 ) . to get the total ground state energy , we add to @xmath73 the contribution from @xmath83 obtained using @xmath58 calculated for optimized @xmath68 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "this contribution per site is @xmath84 so , the total minimized energy per site is @xmath85 using eqs .",
    "( 21 ) and ( 22 ) , the minimized energy per site is @xmath86    using the results of the gutzwiller projection of inter - orbital double occupancies , we write an effective hamiltonian for the jt polarons as : @xmath87 the effects of gutzwiller projection are the density dependent band - width renormalization and a renormalization of the on - site _",
    "intra_orbital attractive interaction from @xmath54 to @xmath88 . from eq .",
    "( 25 ) , it follows that @xmath89 .",
    "we notice that this enhancement is similar to the enhancement of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction ( @xmath90 ) obtained on gutzwiller projection in a @xmath91 model studied in ref@xcite . for the @xmath91 model",
    ", they found that the bare @xmath90 steadily increases with increasing electron density to reach @xmath92 in the mott insulator at the half - filling of their non - degenerate band .",
    "notice also , for our model , that orbitals are decoupled on gutzwiller projection .",
    "now , @xmath93 is clearly an effective attractive hubbard model .",
    "we note that , unlike the usual phonon mediated attractive interaction which is attractive only in the debye shell around the fermi surface , all the polarons experience the attraction @xmath88 or @xmath54 . in the next section ,",
    "we study superconductivity in the weak coupling regime of @xmath88 using a bcs type mean - field ( bcs - mf ) analysis to obtain superconducting energy gap and @xmath94 .",
    "to move forward , we have to fix the weak and strong coupling regimes of the single band attractive hubbard model ( @xmath95 .",
    "we can approximately fix these ranges using the existing studies@xcite on three dimensional non - degenerate attractive hubbard model .",
    "a comparison of results for superconducting @xmath94 obtained using three methods ( t - matrix approximation , determinant quantum monte carlo , and dynamical mean field theory ) and the bcs - mf is given in fig .",
    "2 of ref.@xcite notice that these results are for quarter filling of the band .",
    "the regime of weak coupling , for a given @xmath74 , is the range of @xmath96 within which the pair formation temperature and the superconducting transition temperature are the same . using the calculation of pauli susceptibility ( which would be suppressed above the superconducting @xmath94 in the case pairs form above @xmath94 )",
    ", the authors of@xcite argued that @xmath97 is the bcs - mf regime for @xmath98 .",
    "considering together all these results , we tentatively fixed the bcs - mf regime of the 3d attractive hubbard model to be @xmath99 .",
    "as for the strong coupling regime , all the electrons are in paired states below a pair formation temperature of @xmath100 .",
    "we fixed the bose regime to be for @xmath101 .",
    "the intermediate coupling regime then is obviously @xmath102 . in the weak coupling regime of @xmath54 , the ratio equivalent to @xmath96 in our case",

    "this completes the analysis of superconductivity in the bcs - mf regime of our model . in the next section ,",
    "we consider the strong coupling regime ( the bose regime ) of @xmath54 .",
    "in this regime , all the jt polarons are in paired states below a temperature of @xmath143 . to obtain the bose condensation temperature of these pre - formed pairs , we start from the hamiltonian @xmath57 [ see eq .",

    "then , @xmath155 the hopping processes corresponding to the first and second terms in @xmath152 are shown in fig .",
    "@xmath152 can be calculated considering the probability amplitudes for the processes shown in the figure and we obtained it to be the ground state energy of the hamiltonian @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the gutzwiller projection factor and @xmath158 is the co - ordination number of a site in the lattice .",
    "the bose condensation temperature ( @xmath159 ) in the strong coupling regime of a three dimensional non - degenerate attractive hubbard model was obtained in ref.@xcite . comparing our results with theirs , one can immediately write down the @xmath159 for our case , and it is @xmath160 the above formula is relevant for @xmath161 . here",
    "it must be pointed out that the finite temperature analysis in this section was done in real space and hence one need not worry about the orthogonality of the gutzwiller projected excited state wave functions obtained by varying the occupation numbers @xmath162 , as was done in ref.@xcite .",
    "note that for @xmath76 , we have a mott insulator and @xmath159 is zero . while making @xmath159 estimates",

    "the small polaron formation condition in the strong coupling regime is @xmath163 where @xmath139 is the original half - band - width equal to @xmath164 for a simple cubic lattice we have considered .",
    "the variation of @xmath159 as a function of @xmath136 for various values of @xmath13 is shown in fig .",

    "12 , we have displayed @xmath159 vs. @xmath136 for different values of @xmath139 . decreasing @xmath139 decreases @xmath159 while expanding the @xmath136 range for bose condensation .",
    "finally , @xmath159 vs. @xmath136 for various values of @xmath126 is shown in fig . 13 .",
    "increase of @xmath126 is seen to sharply reduce @xmath159 .",
    "overall , it is clear from the figures that @xmath159 s up to @xmath165 k can be possible in the strong coupling regime .",
    "furthermore , we note that slightly higher values of @xmath159 can be obtained in the intermediate coupling regime as compared to the strong coupling regime threshold ( @xmath166 ) ( see fig . 2 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we have noted earlier that the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath57 is a mott insulator for the case of two electrons per site .",
    "this mott insulating state obtains independent of the value of @xmath54 ( @xmath167 ) ( see also the note in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the insulating state is obtained because of the strong _ inter_orbital repulsion @xmath47 between the jt polarons .",
    "the repulsion @xmath47 narrows the polaron band as the density increases and eventually drives it zero at @xmath76 .",
    "now , due to the presence of finite _ intra_orbital attraction between the polarons , the insulating state has a polaron singlet occupying one of the orbitals on site .",
    "since the singlet can occupy either of the two orbitals available on a site , the insulting ground state is highly degenerate when @xmath47 is infinity .",
    "when @xmath47 is large and finite , a pair on a site can gain energy by virtual hopping to a nearest neighbor vacant orbital .",
    "this gain in energy , in second order perturbation theory , is @xmath168 per polaron .",
    "hence for finite and large @xmath47 the degeneracy of the insulating state reduces to two and the singlets order in alternate orbitals on nn sites and thus we have an orbital density wave state .",
    "we also note that one can map the paired polaron mott insulator to an ising model since at each site the pair could be in either of the orbitals . assigning pseudo - spins @xmath169 to occupation of orbital 1 and @xmath170 to that of orbital 2",
