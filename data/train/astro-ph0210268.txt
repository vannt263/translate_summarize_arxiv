    "the key idea , that primordial density fluctuations grow by gravitational instability driven by cold dark matter ( cdm ) , has been elaborated upon and explored in detail through large - scale numerical simulations on supercomputers , leading to a hierarchical ( ` bottom - up ' ) scenario of structure formation . in this model ,",
    "the first objects to form are on subgalactic scales , and merge to make progressively bigger structures ( ` hierarchical clustering ' ) .",

    "perhaps the most remarkable success of this theory has been the prediction of anisotropies in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation at about the level subsequently measured by the _ cobe _ satellite and most recently by the _ boomerang _ , _ maxima _ , _ dasi _ , and _ cbi _ experiment .    in spite of the remarkable progress achieved in recent years ,",
    "many fundamental questions ( beside , of course , the nature of the dark matter and dark energy components ) remain only partially answered . how and when was the universe reheated ?",
    "we know that at least some galaxies and quasars were already shining when the universe was less than @xmath4 yr old .",
    "but when exactly did the first luminous structures form and how bright were they ?",
    "we believe there is a strong coupling between the thermodynamic state of the igm and the process of galaxy formation , and we suspect complex feedback mechanisms are at work in this interaction .",
    "the detailed astrophysics of these processes is , however , unclear .",
    "finally , the precise location and degree of metal enrichment of most the baryons in the universe remains an open question .",

    "1 ) : previously growing density perturbations decay as their mass drops below the new jeans mass .",
    "photoionization by the ultraviolet radiation from the first stars and quasars will heat the igm to temperatures of @xmath25k ( corresponding to a jeans mass @xmath26 at @xmath27 ) , suppressing gas infall into low mass halos and preventing new ( dwarf ) galaxies from forming .",
    "hierarchical clustering theories provide a well - defined cosmological framework in which the history of baryonic material can in principle be tracked through the development of cosmic structure . probing the reionization epoch",
    "may then provide a means for constraining competing models for the formation of cosmic structures .",
    "for example , popular modifications of the cdm paradigm that attempt to improve over cdm by suppressing the primordial power - spectrum on small scales , like warm dark matter ( wdm ) , are known to reduce the number of collapsed halos at high redshifts and make it more difficult to reionize the universe @xcite .    in practice , we are unable to predict when reionization actually occurred . while n - body@xmath12hydrodynamical simulations have convincingly shown that intergalactic gas is expected to fragment into structures at early times in cdm cosmogonies , the same simulations are much less able to predict the efficiency with which the first gravitationally collapsed objects lit up the universe at the end of the dark age .",
    "the crucial processes of star formation , feedback ( e.g. the effect of the heat input from the first generation of sources on later ones ) , and assembly of massive black holes in the nuclei of galaxies are poorly understood .",
    "consider the following illustrative example :    hydrogen photoionization requires more than one photon above 13.6 ev per hydrogen atom : of order @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is the volume - averaged hydrogen recombination timescale ) extra photons appear to be needed to keep the gas in overdense regions and filaments ionized against radiative recombinations @xcite . a ` typical ' stellar population produces during its lifetime about 4000 lyman continuum ( ionizing ) photons per stellar proton .",
    "a fraction @xmath30% of cosmic baryons must then condense into stars to supply the requisite ultraviolet flux .",
    "this estimate assumes a standard ( salpeter ) initial mass function ( imf ) , which determines the relative abundances of hot , high mass stars versus cold , low mass ones .",
    "the very first generation of stars ( ` population iii ' ) must have formed , however , out of unmagnetized metal - free gas : numerical simulations of the fragmentation of pure h and he molecular clouds @xcite @xcite have shown that these characteristics likely led to a ` top - heavy ' imf biased towards very massive stars ( vmss , i.e. stars a few hundred times more massive than the sun ) , quite different from the present - day galactic case .",
    "metal - free vmss emit about @xmath31 lyman continuum photons per stellar baryon @xcite , approximately @xmath32 times more than a standard stellar population",
    ". a corresponding smaller fraction of cosmic baryons would have to collapse then into vmss to reionize the universe , @xmath33 .",
    "there are of course further complications .",
    "since , at zero metallicity , mass loss through radiatively - driven stellar winds is expected to be negligible @xcite , population iii stars may actually die losing only a small fraction of their mass .",
    "if they retain their large mass until death , vmss with masses @xmath34 will encounter the electron - positron pair instability and disappear in a giant nuclear - powered explosion @xcite , leaving no compact remnants and polluting the universe with the first heavy elements @xcite . in still heavier stars",
    ", however , oxygen and silicon burning is unable to drive an explosion , and complete collapse to a black hole will occur instead @xcite .",
    "thin disk accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole releases about 50 mev per baryon .",
    "the conversion of a trace amount of the total baryonic mass into early black holes , @xmath35 , would suffice to reionize the universe .    quite apart from the uncertainties in the imf ,",
    "it is also unclear what fraction of the cold gas will be retained in protogalaxies after the formation of the first stars ( this will affect the global efficiency of star formation at these epochs ) and whether an early input of mechanical energy will play a role in determining the thermal and ionization state of the igm on large scales . the same massive stars that emit ultraviolet light also explode as supernovae ( sne ) , returning most of the metals to the interstellar medium of pregalactic systems and injecting about @xmath36ergs per event in kinetic energy . for a standard imf",
    ", one has about one sn every @xmath37 of baryons that forms stars .",
    "a complex network of feedback mechanisms is likely at work in these systems , as the gas in shallow potential is more easily blown away @xcite , thereby quenching star formation .",
    "furthermore , as the blastwaves produced by supernova explosions sweep the surrounding intergalactic gas and enrich it with newly formed heavy elements @xcite , they may inhibit the formation of surrounding low - mass galaxies due to ` baryonic stripping ' @xcite , and drive vast portions of the igm to a significantly higher adiabat than expected from photoionization .",
    "by a redshift of 7 no large galaxies should have assembled yet , but hierarchical clustering theories predict the existence of a large population of subgalactic fragments with masses comparable to present - day dwarf ellipticals .",
    "what are the prospects for detecting these early star - forming systems before reionization breakthrough ? prior to complete reionization at redshift @xmath38 , sources of ultraviolet radiation will be seen behind a large column of intervening gas that is still neutral .",
    "photons with energies between 10.2 and 13.6 ev will propagate freely into the igm until , redshifted by the hubble expansion , they will ultimately reach the transition energy of 10.2 ev , resonantly scatter off neutral hydrogen , and be removed from the line - of - sight .",
    "the spectrum of a source at @xmath39 should then show a gunn - peterson @xcite absorption trough at wavelengths shorter than @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , the gunn - peterson optical depth would be so large that the damping wing of this absorption trough would spill over into the red of ly@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this characteristic feature extends for more than @xmath42 to the red of the resonance , and may significantly suppress the emission line in the spectra of the first generation of cosmic sources . a disappearing ly@xmath3could",

    "if the escape fraction for lyman continuum photons into the intergalactic space is significant , a photoionized region of igm will surround each individual source @xcite , increasing the transmission of photons redward of the resonance .",
    "if the source lifetime is shorter than the cosmic expansion and gas recombination timescales , the volume of ionized gas will be proportional to the total number of photons produced above 13.6 ev that leak into intergalactic space ; the effect of this local photoionization is to greatly reduce the scattering opacity between the redshift of the source and the boundary of its region . in fig .",
    "2 i have plotted the expected ultraviolet spectrum and line profile for a luminous star - forming galaxy observed at @xmath48 before reionization breakthrough ( assumed to occur at @xmath49 ) , as a function of stellar age .",
    "the suppression effect of the ly@xmath3emission line by the red wing of the gunn - peterson trough , while clearly visible at early times ( i.e. in the absence of a local region , top - left panel ) , weakens significantly with time as the size of the photoionized zone increases . in this figure",
    "the escape fraction of ionizing photons into the igm was assumed to be 50% .",
    "in general ( depending on the intrinsic line width ) , the emission line appears to remain observable at late times if the escape fraction of lyman continuum photons exceeds 510% ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this should be taken just as an illustrative example , as in some numerical simulations @xcite reionization was already well in progress prior to redshift 6 , and the form of the damping profile would be different in the case of patchy ionization along the line of sight .",
    "yet , the figure shows that the detection of emission in the spectra of luminous galaxies can not then be used , by itself , as a constraint on the reionization epoch . even before reionization",
    ", the line is unlikely to be obscured from view ; early star - forming protogalaxies may still be best detected in the near - ir via their ly@xmath3emission .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    a quick summary of the physics of 21 cm radiation will illustrate the basic ideas and unresolved issues behind these studies",
    ". the emission or absorption of 21 cm photons from a neutral igm is governed by the hydrogen spin temperature @xmath58 defined by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the number densities of atoms in the singlet and triplet @xmath62 hyperfine levels and @xmath63 k is the excitation temperature of the 21 cm transition . in the presence of only the cmb radiation with @xmath64k , the spin states will reach thermal equilibrium with the cmb on a timescale of @xmath65yr ( @xmath66s@xmath67 is the spontaneous decay rate of the hyperfine transition of atomic hydrogen ) , and intergalactic will produce neither an absorption nor an emission signature .",
    "a mechanism is required that decouples @xmath58 and @xmath68 , e.g. by coupling the spin temperature instead to the kinetic temperature @xmath69 of the gas itself .",
    "two mechanisms are available , collisions between hydrogen atoms @xcite and scattering by ly@xmath3photons @xcite . the collision - induced coupling between the spin and kinetic temperatures is dominated by the spin - exchange process between the colliding hydrogen atoms .",
    "the rate , however , is too small for realistic igm densities at the redshifts of interest , although collisions may be important in dense regions with @xmath70^{-2}$ ] , like virialized minihalos .    in the low density igm ,",
    "the dominant mechanism is the scattering of continuum ultraviolet photons redshifted by the hubble expansion into local ly@xmath3photons .",
    "the many scatterings mix the hyperfine levels of neutral hydrogen in its ground state via intermediate transitions to the @xmath71 state , the wouthuysen - field process .",
    "as the neutral igm is highly opaque to resonant scattering , the shape of the continuum radiation spectrum near ly@xmath3will follow a boltzmann distribution with a temperature given by the kinetic temperature of the igm @xcite . in this case",
    "the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen is a weighted mean between the matter and cmb temperatures .",
    "there exists then a critical value of the background flux of ly@xmath3 photons which , if greatly exceeded , would drive the spin temperature away from @xmath68 .",
    "in @xcite we used n - body cosmological simulations and , assuming a fully neutral medium with @xmath72 , showed that prior to reionization the same network of sheets and filaments ( the ` cosmic web ' ) that gives rise to the forest at @xmath73 should lead to fluctuations in the 21 cm brightness temperature at higher redshifts ( fig .",
    "3 ) . at 150 mhz ( @xmath74 ) , for observations with a bandwidth of 1 mhz , the root mean square fluctuations should be @xmath75 mk at @xmath76 , decreasing with scale .",
    "because of the smoothness of the cmb sky , fluctuations in the 21 cm radiation will dominate the cmb fluctuations by about 2 orders of magnitude on arcmin scales .    while the microphysics is well understood , our understanding of the astrophysics of 21 cm tomography is still poor . as mentioned above , it is the presence of a sufficient flux of ly@xmath3photons which renders the neutral igm ` visible ' . without heating sources , the adiabatic expansion of the universe will lower the kinetic temperature of the gas well below that of the cmb , and",
    "the igm will be detectable through its absorption .",
    "if there are sources of radiation that preheat the igm , it may be possible to detect it in emission instead .",
    "the energetic demand for heating the igm above the cmb temperature is meager , only @xmath77 ev per particle at @xmath78 .",
    "consequently , even relatively inefficient heating mechanisms may be important warming sources well before the universe was actually reionized .",
    "perhaps more importantly , prior to full reionization the igm will be a mixture of neutral , partially ionized , and fully ionized structures : low - density regions will be fully ionized first , followed by regions with higher and higher densities .",
    "radio maps at @xmath79 cm will show a patchwork of emission / absorption signals from zones modulated by regions where no signal is detectable against the cmb .",
    "despite much recent progress in our understanding of the formation of early cosmic structure and the high - redshift universe , the end of the cosmic `` dark ages '' remains one of missing link in galaxy formation and evolution studies .",
    "we are left very uncertain about the whole era from @xmath80 to @xmath81 yr  the epoch of the first galaxies , stars , supernovae , and massive black holes .",
    "some of the issues discussed above are likely to remain a topic of lively controversy until the launch of the _ next generation space telescope _ , ideally suited to image the earliest generation of stars in the universe .",
    "if the first massive black holes form in pregalactic systems at very high redshifts , they will be incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger halos , sink to the center owing to dynamical friction , accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive , and form a binary system @xcite .",
    "their coalescence would be signalled by the emission of low - frequency gravitational waves detectable by the planned _ laser interferometer space antenna_. the search at 21 cm for the epoch of first light has become one of the main science drivers of the _ low frequency array_. while remaining an extremely challenging project due to foreground contamination from extragalactic radio sources @xcite , the detection and imaging of these small - scale structures with _ lofar _ is a tantalizing possibility within range of the thermal noise of the array .",
