    "genealogies are fundamental in studying population models . in this paper , we focus on the large population limit of constant size populations evolving under _ resampling _ , _ selection _ and _ mutation _ in a stochastic fashion .",
    "the type distribution of this limit is modeled by the fleming ",
    "viot measure - valued diffusion . here",
    ", resampling is the random reproduction of individuals , mutation is the random change of ( allelic ) types of individuals and selection is the dependence of offspring numbers on the types . by defining random reproduction",
    "we obtain ancestral relations between individuals described by a randomly evolving genealogy . in our approach ,",
    "we model both the genealogical and the type structure in the population .",
    "populations under selection are modeled either by finitely or by infinitely many individuals ( diffusion ) .",
    "an analysis of the former was carried out using the biased voter model by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the large - population limit of the type frequencies leads to the measure - valued fleming ",
    "viot dynamics ; see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , donnelly and kurtz ( @xcite ) , dawson and greven ( @xcite ) .",
    "a main tool in the mathematical analysis of these models is historical information about the population in the form of genealogical relations of individuals .    in applications ,",
    "genealogies of a population sample are most important . in particular ,",
    "mutation rate estimators are based on the average genealogical distance or the tree length of the genealogical tree spanned by a sample of individuals [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "moreover , the enrichment of population models by information on ancestral lines has become common [ e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ] . to cope with the modeling",
    "needs in population genetics , many extensions and generalizations of the fleming ",
    "viot dynamics have been given , for example , the evolution under recombination [ see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , donnelly and kurtz ( @xcite ) ] , as well as the evolution of a spatially distributed population [ @xcite , dawson and greven ( @xcite ) ] and general exchangeable modes of exchange of types [ bertoin and le  gall ( @xcite ) ] .    in order to understand the genealogical structure of population models ,",
    "consider the neutral case ( i.e. , no selection ) and a fixed time @xmath0 first .",
    "since the resampling mechanism is completely independent of allelic types , the genealogy can be constructed from the present to the past using common ancestors of ancestral lines . in the case of finite variance offspring distributions [ and a weak assumption on their third moments , @xcite ] , the result is kingman s coalescent [ @xcite ] .",
    "as populations evolve , the underlying genealogies evolve as well .",
    "consequently , the resampling mechanism allows one to describe genealogical information of individuals at all times .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to give a new approach to studying ancestral relationships under selection via evolving genealogies . in particular , we extend the construction of the tree - valued fleming ",
    "viot dynamics under neutrality carried out in @xcite .",
    "note that the resulting processes are among the first tree - valued stochastic processes in the literature [ but see also zambotti ( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "the difficulty in understanding the genealogical structure of a population under selection already arises for fixed time genealogies .",
    "most importantly , types and offspring distributions of individuals are not independent in the selective case . to deal with this dependence ,",
    "three different approaches have been used .",
    "first , @xcite , @xcite condition the construction of the genealogy on the allelic frequency path ; see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . if the allelic frequency path is known , and an allelic type is present with frequency @xmath1 $ ] at time @xmath0 , the rate of coalescence of two lines of this type is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "this construction leads to valuable insights , for example , into the allelic types of ancestors of the population [ @xcite ] .",
    "second , the ancestral selection graph from @xcite and @xcite gives a two - step procedure to derive the genealogy of a population sample .",
    "this construction can , for example , be used to see that any ancestor has a higher fitness than a randomly chosen individual [ @xcite ] .",
    "[ other results derived from the ancestral selection graph are , e.g. , given in @xcite , slade ( @xcite , @xcite ) and @xcite . ]",
    "an important property of this second approach is that the process generating the genealogy arises as a dual process of the measure - valued fleming ",
    "viot process [ @xcite ] .",
    "a connection between the first two approaches has recently been found in the case of strong balancing selection [ @xcite ] .",
    "third , the lookdown construction of @xcite and @xcite establishes a particle representation of the fleming ",
    "viot process with and without selection .",
    "genealogies can as well be read off from the lookdown process . in the neutral case ,",
    "the lookdown construction has , for example , been used to study the evolution of the time to the most recent common ancestor of the population [ @xcite , @xcite ] . in the selective case ,",
    "hardly any properties of the genealogies have been read off from the lookdown process .    in the present paper , we extend the analysis of the neutral tree - valued fleming  viot process from @xcite to include mutation and selection .",
    "this leads to new tree - valued processes describing the joint evolution of the allelic type - frequencies and the underlying genealogy .",
    "we encode random genealogies ( trees ) as random metric spaces ; see @xcite for the first paper in this direction . in our construction , the genealogies evolve forward in time , but contain historical information about the population .",
    "allelic types are encoded by marks attached to elements of the metric space .",
    "gives rise to a genealogical tree , that is , a ( pseudo-)metric space on the set of leaves .",
    "the leaves of the tree are marked by the types of the corresponding individuals . ]",
    "the starting point of our investigation is the continuous - time moran model with mutation and selection .",
    "this is a model of a population of finitely many ( distinct ) individuals evolving under resampling , mutation and selection and is best studied by its graphical representation . at any fixed time , this representation generates a genealogical tree marked with types ; see also figure  [ figgr - costr ] . in a straightforward way ,",
    "this allows us to introduce dynamics of genealogies with marks ( types ) as piecewise deterministic markov process with jumps .",
    "we show that the large population limit of this collection of tree - valued markov processes exists and is the unique solution of a martingale problem ( theorems  [ t1 ] and  [ t3 ] ) .",
    "the resulting process is an enrichment of the measure - valued process and we call it the _ tree - valued fleming  viot process with mutation and selection _",
    "( _ tfvms _ ) . on the way",
    ", we develop the stochastic analysis for tree - valued processes .",
    "in particular , we give a girsanov - transform for our processes and show that genealogies with and without selection can be studied using a change of measure ( theorem  [ t2]).=1    we continue by showing that the function - valued dual for the fleming ",
    "viot process [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] works in the tree - valued setting . using this duality and ideas from dawson and greven ( @xcite ) , we obtain a stochastic representation for the expectation of functionals of sampled finite marked subtrees . as an application we establish the long - time behavior and the ergodicity of the tfvms ( theorem  [ t4 ] ) , if the measure - valued fleming ",
    "viot process is ergodic .",
    "we use this equilibrium to study an important quantity in empirical population genetics in the case of two allelic types and additive selection : the genealogical distance of two randomly sampled individuals of the population .",
    "we compute the laplace transform of the genealogical distance of two sampled individuals in the case where the selection coefficient is small ( theorem  [ t5 ] ) .",
    "this result suggests that tree - lengths are shorter under additive selection .",
    "this assertion is widely believed to be true among biologists , but has never been proved .",
    "our construction gives a process on the space of marked trees , which we can treat as marked metric measure spaces .",
    "for convenience , we choose the space of types to be a compact metric space . for the construction",
    ", we require knowledge of fundamental topological properties of the marked metric measure spaces .",
    "while the case without marks is treated in @xcite , topological properties for the case with marks are developed in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we first describe a version of the moran model with mutation and selection ( section  [ ssgraph ] ) , its graphical construction ( section  [ ssgraphconst ] ) and then extend the description to the tree - valued case ( section  [ sstmmms ] ) . finally , we discuss various aspects of models including selection ( section  [ ssbackground ] ) .",

    "while the mechanism for haploid selection is intuitively clear , the diploid case requires some explanation . here , @xmath29 is the number of haploid individuals , which are arranged in pairs to form diploids .",
    "since the formation of diploids according to the type frequencies of the haploids acts on a fast timescale , we can assume that the population is in hardy  weinberg equilibrium at all times , meaning that the diploid individuals are random pairs of haploids , and this formation is independent for all times .    actually , to model diploid selection",
    ", we would have to say that every quadruple @xmath30 of pairwise distinct individuals is involved in a selective event at rate @xmath31 in which the haploid @xmath12 from the diploid individual @xmath32 is replaced by an offspring of haploid @xmath9 from the diploid individual @xmath33 . however , as the haploid individual @xmath34 is not affected by such events , our definition above is appropriate .",
