    "although no particles were known ( and have yet to be found ! ) to belong to this family , the pomeron trajectory was introduced in the 1970s to account for the observations that the @xmath2 cross section was increasing with energy at the serpukov 70 gev proton synchrontron , and the elastic and total @xmath3 cross sections , which were falling with increasing energy , started to flatten out and then increase as larger collision energies became available at the cern intersecting storage ring ( isr ) @xmath3 collider .",

    "the cdf two - gap results indicate that calculations for diffractive processes which already have a rapidity gap are largely free from gap survival considerations .",
    "thus , multigap diffraction opens the way for qcd studies of diffraction without the complications arising from gap survival and will undoubtedly become the arena on which diffraction will be confronted by qcd at the large hadron collider .",
    "in this section we adapt the qcd approach of section  [ approach ] to diffractive dis at hera and diffractive dijet production at the tevatron : @xmath140 the hard process may involve several color `` emissions '' from the surviving proton comprising a color singlet with vacuum quantum numbers .",

    "this constant normalization leads to two important predictions :    * the pomeron intercept in diffractive dis ( ddis ) is @xmath120-dependent and equals the average of the soft and hard intercepts : @xmath151\\nonumber \\label{eq : heraintercept}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] * the ratio of ddis to dis structure functions at a given @xmath33 is independent of @xmath0 and @xmath120 : @xmath152_{\\rm hera}= \\frac{a_{\\rm norm}\\cdot c_q}{\\xi^{1+\\epsilon}}= \\frac{\\rm constant}{\\xi^{1+\\epsilon } } \\label{eq : rhera}\\ ] ]    hera data are consistent with these predictions  @xcite .      at the tevatron , where high soft parton densities lead to saturation , @xmath147 must be renormalized @xmath153 eq .  ( [ eq : renorm ] ) by being replaced by @xmath154 where we have used @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "thus , the diffractive structure function acquires a term @xmath157 , and the diffractive to inclusive structure function ratio a term @xmath158 .",
    "this prediction is confirmed by the cdf data on dijet production , where the @xmath0-dependence of the diffractive to inclusive ratio was measured to be @xmath159 ( see eq .  [ eq : sfratio ] ) . of the @xmath160 dependence",
    ", care should be taken to separately renormalize the sea gluon and sea quark contributions , and also consider the contribution of the valence quarks ( reggeon contributions ) . ]",
    "we have reviewed experimental data on soft and hard diffraction , concetrating on aspects that point to the partonic nature of the exchange ( pomeron ) responsible for rapidity gap formation .    in soft diffraction ,",
    "the exponential dependence of total [ elastic ] cross sections on @xmath161 [ @xmath162 , the rapidity region in which there is [ there is not ] particle production , allows differential diffractive cross sections to be factorized into two terms : one representing the total cross section at the reduced energy squared , defined by @xmath163 , and the other depending on @xmath164 and interpreted as the gap formation probablity . by ( re)normalizing the latter to unity and multiplying by a color factor @xmath80 ( @xmath165 for @xmath166 gaps ) derived from gluon and quark color factors weighted by the corresponding inclusive pdf s at @xmath89 gev@xmath21 ,",
    "cross sections for single , central , and multigap diffraction are obtained , which are in excellent agreement with experimental results .",
    "prominent aspects of the data explained in this model are the @xmath43-scaling behavior and the independece on the number of gaps of the suppression of diffractice cross sections at high energies relative to regge theory predictions .    in hard diffraction , the diffractive structure function",
    "is obtained by convoluting the inclusive @xmath167 with the parton density at @xmath142 at scale @xmath89 gev@xmath21 , identifying the gap formation probability term , and ( re)normalizing the latter to unity at the tevatron .",
    "aspects of the data explained by this approach are the rise of the pomeron intercept with @xmath120 and the constant ddis / dis ratio versus @xmath0 and @xmath120 at hera , as well as the falling as @xmath168 of the sd / nd ratio at the tevatron .",
    "also explained in this model is the factorization breakdown ( and restoration for multigap diffraction ! ) between tevatron diffracive structure functions and expectations from ddis at hera .    in conclusion ,",
    "scaling and factorization aspects of the data have been phenomenologically interpreted in a parton model approach , in which diffraction is treated as a low @xmath0 partonic interaction subject to color constraints .",
