    "the dipolar resonances have been found out . only in narrow intervals of values of external magnetic field",
    "a nonzero transfer of atoms between zeeman components is possible .",
    "this happens because orbital motion of atoms is quantized and a particular amount of energy is necessary to promote atoms to higher energy orbital state .",
    "this required energy is just the zeeman energy . in this paper",
    "we show that dipolar resonances are present also in chromium condensates .",

    "they can overwhelm the zeeman energy and many of new quantum phases with atoms distributed over a few components are possible @xcite .",

    "it includes the kinetic , potential , and zeeman energies , respectively .",
    "the external magnetic field @xmath4 is aligned along the @xmath5 axis and the magnetic moment operator of chromium atom is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the bohr magneton , @xmath8 is the lande factor , and @xmath9 are standard @xmath10 spin matrices ( the spin quantum number @xmath11 for the chromium atom in the ground state ) .",
    "two other terms in ( [ eqmot ] ) originate from the two - particle interactions .",
    "the second one , @xmath12 , corresponds to the contact interactions and can be written in the form @xmath13 since the contact interactions operator @xmath14 commutes with the total spin of colliding atoms as well as with its projection on the @xmath5 axis , it can be spectrally decomposed as @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is a state of a pair of atoms with the total spin @xmath17 and projection @xmath18 , which in turn is expanded in a product two - particle basis @xmath19 where the symbol @xmath20 is the clebsch - gordan coefficient and @xmath21 is the state of a single atom with the spin @xmath22 and projection @xmath23 .",

    "we suddenly reverse the direction of magnetic field and change its value .",
    "experimentally , usually instead of changing the direction of magnetic field the atoms are transferred ( for instance , by radio - frequency sweep @xcite ) to the @xmath51 zeeman state and then the field is decreased .",
    "in such a way the dipolar relaxation to other zeeman components becomes energetically allowed and their populations as a function of magnetic field can be investigated .",

    "on top of every such an excitation there are softer axial excitations @xmath69 , with @xmath70 being odd .",

    "[ densres ] ) from the transfer of atoms to axially excited states with three and five quanta of axial excitation , respectively .    finally , we compare the resonance structure for chromium condensates with different number of atoms .",
    "the main observation is that by increasing the atomic density ( i.e. by increasing the number of atoms in a condensate ) resonances become stronger overlapped merging almost first two groups of resonances visible in fig . [ res ] ( see fig . [ shift ] ) .",
    "there appears also a shift towards smaller magnetic fields . evidently , the shift of resonances is related to contact interactions which get more pronounced for higher atomic density .",
    "its appearance is visible already on a level of first order perturbation calculus since the scattering length @xmath73 is positive . for large enough atomic densities",
    "the main resonance extends even up to the region where magnetic field is of the same direction as the field used to prepare the initial sample of atomic cloud .",
    "this feature is responsible for the occurrence of demagnetization of initially polarized chromium condensate as discussed in sec .",
    "[ demagnetization ] .",
    "in experiment of ref . @xcite the chromium condensate prepared in its ground state @xmath50 is adiabatically loaded in the lowest energy band of two - dimensional optical lattice .",
    "then , with the help of radio - frequency sweep the chromium atoms are transferred to the most upper state @xmath51 .",
    "after that the dipolar relaxation of atoms to other zeeman components becomes energetically allowed . what is observed in experiment",
    "is a threshold in dipolar relaxation as a function of the magnetic field . below the threshold",
    "no transfer of atoms to other components is present . above the threshold ( i.e. for high enough magnetic fields ) the relaxation to @xmath74 zeeman state",
    "is observed .",
    "for the lattice with maximal depth in each direction of about @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the recoil energy , the threshold magnetic field is approximately at @xmath77 mg . above threshold , as it is said in ref .",
    "@xcite , first excited band in the lattice becomes populated by atoms in @xmath74 zeeman state .",
    "no population in the second band is reported .",
    "also no production of rotating states in each lattice site is observed as could be according to the einstein - de haas effect .",
    "this result is explained in terms of decaying process of a quantized vortex due to the tunneling .    to verify the existence of the threshold in dipolar relaxation with respect to the magnetic field we performed numerical simulations on a square plaquette of four optical sites .",
    "the number of chromium atoms per site is @xmath78 and the peak density is of the order of @xmath79@xmath56 .",
    "the plaquette is created by two counter - propagating pairs of laser beams with the wavelengths equal to @xmath80 nm positioned in the @xmath60 plane and a harmonic trapping potential of @xmath81hz frequency in @xmath5 direction .",
    "the depth of the plaquette in each direction is @xmath75 .",
    "each site potential can be approximated by a harmonic trap with the frequency equal to @xmath82khz and a simple estimation neglecting contact interactions gives the position of the first dipolar resonance at @xmath83 mg .",
    "contact interactions move the position of this resonance which is then at the value of about @xmath77 mg ( approximately @xmath84khz in units of frequency ) , see fig .",

    "the value of this threshold remains in agreement with experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig .",
    "@xmath41 , where the population of the first excited band after @xmath85ms of dipolar relaxation is plotted ) .",
    "the resonance described above is associated with the absorption of one quanta of rotational energy in the @xmath60 plane . however , as it was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for rubidium condensate , for large occupation of initial state the process during which one atom flips its spin dominates upon the dipolar collision .",
    "this is because the dipolar coupling term ( see eq.([dipolar ] ) ) responsible for this process is proportional to the density of the highly occupied @xmath50 component , @xmath86 , i.e. the initial atomic density .",
    "on the contrary , the dipolar term which is responsible for simultaneous flip of spin of two interacting atoms is govern by a term proportional to @xmath87 . in this process",
    "the second excited band becomes populated and doubly charged vortices should appear together with even number of excitation quanta in axial direction . note that initially there are no atoms in the @xmath57 component , i.e. @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , in the mean field limit this process can start only if some initial population is present in @xmath57 zeeman state . in order to account for this process we introduced some small initial seed in this state .",
    "nevertheless in our simulations we did not observe any significant transfer of atoms to the second excited band .",
    "symmetries of dipolar interactions have important consequences on the final states of @xmath57 atoms .",
    "namely if only one of the two interacting atoms flips its spin these final states must correspond to odd number of quanta of axial excitations .",
    "consequently the spatial density must exhibit even number of rings in @xmath5 direction .",

    "only singly quantized vortices are generated in plaquette sites ( as opposed to what is suggested in ref .",
    "the lower panel , on the other hand , depicts that spatial structure of @xmath57 atoms state gets more complicated while increasing the magnetic field .",
    "the number of rings in @xmath5 direction in each site increases .",
    "this behavior is like the one appearing in the case of a condensate confined in a single harmonic trap discussed in the previous section although no separate resonant peaks are now visible ( see fig . [ threshold ] ) .",
    "this is because the resonances are broadened due to the presence of other plaquette sites .",
    "simple estimation gives @xmath89 mg as the value the magnetic field need to be increased to change the spatial structure of the state from the one with two rings ( left frame ) to that with six rings ( right frame ) .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    although numerically found position of the threshold compares with experimental value reported in ref .",
    "@xcite the width of numerical threshold remains much narrower .",
    "this width should be related to the width of the excited lattice band to which atoms are promoted via dipolar interactions . since in our case the spatial state of @xmath57 atoms exhibits always a singly quantized vortex ( see fig . [ dens2x2 ] ) only a first excited band ( or rather quasiband since we work with @xmath92 plaquette ) is populated .",
    "the tunneling energy for the first excited band for the lattice with the lattice period equal to ( @xmath93)nm and with the maximal depth of @xmath94 is @xmath95 .",
    "therefore the width of the first excited band equals @xmath96khz which , in units of magnetic field , is @xmath97 mg .",
    "numerically obtained width of the threshold is just about this value ( see fig . [ threshold ] ) .    hence , our explanation of the appearance of the threshold differs from that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is argued that mainly the second excited band is populated via dipolar interactions .",
    "subsequently , atoms in the second excited band rapidly loose their orbital angular momentum as a result of tunneling and then via collisional deexcitation with atoms in the ground band they start to populate the first excited band .",
    "therefore population accumulates in the first excited band as observed in experiment . in our calculations , on the other hand ,",
    "we see direct population of the first excited band .",
    "this is because the spatial state of @xmath57 atoms exhibits only one excitation in the @xmath60 plane ( since it is a singly quantized vortex ) . in our explanation",
    "the width of the threshold is therefore related to the width of the first excited band .",
    "we observe in our calculations , however , that vortices disappear on a time scale of the order of milliseconds .",
    "this time scale agrees with the tunneling time in the first excited band .",
    "it is an indication that vortices decease because of tunneling .",
    "finally , we consider the spontaneous demagnetization phenomenon observed experimentally in a chromium condensate in extremely low magnetic fields . in this experiment ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) the chromium condensate is produced in an optical dipole trap in @xmath50 state .",
    "the large enough magnetic field ( about @xmath98 mg in this case ) was turned on during evaporation .",
    "for such a value of magnetic field the system is in the ferromagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "next , the magnetic field was reduced to the values below @xmath42 mg at which , according to the zero temperature phase diagram for chromium @xcite , the system prefers staying in other than ferromagnetic phases .",
    "these are the polar or cycling phases or the phases in which all zeeman components are occupied .",
    "indeed , population of all states was experimentally observed both in the case of chromium condensate confined in a harmonic trap as well as in an optical lattice in which case the peak density was almost an order of magnitude larger than for harmonic trap . in the latter case the demagnetization occurs for larger magnetic fields .    to study spontaneous demagnetization we did numerical calculations for a chromium condensate confined in a harmonic trap .",
    "trap frequencies equal @xmath99hz as in experiment @xcite , the number of atoms is @xmath100 .",
    "it gives the peak density as high as @xmath101@xmath56 .",
    "the scattering lengths are : @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 in units of the bohr radius @xcite .",
    "initially , since external magnetic field is high enough , all atoms occupy @xmath50 zeeman state , i.e. the system is in ferromagnetic phase .",
    "we then suddenly decrease the magnetic field to the value below @xmath42 mg and study succeeding evolution .",
    "it comes off the phase diagram at zero temperature that for magnetic fields below the threshold @xmath106",
    "@xcite @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the atomic density , the system is no longer in ferromagnetic phase .",
    "below @xmath106 the ground state of the system changes its character and some nontrivial dynamics is expected when the magnetic field is decreased from high to low values . in our case @xmath109 mg which is of the same order of magnitude as we found numerically ( equal approximately to @xmath110 mg for the peak density of @xmath101@xmath56 , see fig .",
    "[ magn ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ magn ] we plot the magnetization ( defined as a projection of total spin , @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the number of atoms in @xmath113 component ) of a chromium condensate as a function of magnetic field .",
    "we consider condensates with different number of atoms .",
    "the demagnetization begins for magnetic fields well below @xmath42 mg in agreement with the formula ( [ bth ] ) .",
    "according to this formula the onset of the demagnetization process occurs for higher magnetic fields when the condensate is denser .",
    "[ magn ] shows that this feature is reproduced by numerics .",
    "it is also observed in experiment when the condensate is loaded into the optical lattice instead of the harmonic trap which results in the peak density almost an order of magnitude higher ( see fig . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    reasoning based on the phase diagram alone is not able , however , to explain what is observed in numerics .",
    "it turns out that what happens strongly depends on the sign of the magnetic field . for negative magnetic fields ( i.e. pointed towards the negative @xmath5 axis )",
    "we find even stronger depolarization , the magnetization of the system gets even smaller than for positive magnetic fields .",
    "the explanation is as follows .",
    "first , one has to remember that only dipolar interactions can trigger the process of populating the @xmath57 state when all particles are initially polarized in @xmath50 state .",
    "but as we already know from the previous sections , the transfer of atoms related to dipolar interactions is effective only on resonance .",
    "the first resonance occurs for low magnetic fields , mainly negative .",
    "when the density of a condensate increases the position of the first resonance is moved towards positive fields because of the contact interactions which shift the initial state energy towards the energy of @xmath57 component .",
    "therefore for dense enough condensates a significant transfer of atoms to @xmath57 state becomes possible also for positive magnetic fields on the expense of the contact rather than zeeman energy .",
    "this is the origin of demagnetization mechanism as observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize that demagnetization process is actually related to the coupling mechanism which can trigger the transfer process . in the studied case",
    "the coupling is due to the dipole - dipole interactions which are effective only at the resonance .",
    "depending on the density the first dipolar resonance can occur for positive or negative ( low enough in both cases ) magnetic fields .",
    "( [ bth ] ) is therefore only a necessary condition for the demagnetization ( energetic instability ) , but the dynamical transfer is related to the coupling mechanism which has a resonant character .    for magnetic field @xmath114 mg , for example ,",
    "atoms get finally almost equally distributed over all zeeman components , see fig .",
    "[ rel ] . in this case",
    "the magnetization is about zero .",
    "there are three distinct regimes during the demagnetization process .",
    "in the first one ( of duration of a few milliseconds ) the dynamics is mainly governed by the dipolar interactions . during the evolution",
    "the spatial states of @xmath115 components exhibit quantized vortices with charges equal to @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "after this short period , however , the contact interactions start to play dominant role and the thermalization process occurs - the circulation disappears .",
    "a signature of thermalization ( the second regime ) is already visible while looking at the kinetic energies of spinor components as a function of time ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . fig .",
    "[ kinene ] shows that after @xmath117ms of evolution the kinetic energies of all components equilibrate .",
    "it can be checked within the classical field approximation @xcite that after @xmath117ms the fraction of total thermal atoms in each component becomes @xmath118 .",
    "hence , the kinetic energy per thermal atom gets the same in each zeeman state which exactly means that the system has reached the third regime , the thermal equilibrium .",
    "we have also checked whether the onset of demagnetization process is indeed related to the existence of the lowest energy dipolar resonance .",
    "one might assume that another scenario happens and the spontaneous demagnetization is triggered by the processes in which atoms are promoted to @xmath57 state via dipolar interactions while their kinetic energy is changed into the zeeman energy .",
    "no resonance condition is necessary for such a process .",
    "therefore we added an extra noise to the initial state of atoms in @xmath50 component which is equivalent to putting thermal atoms into the system @xcite and repeated our calculations for different values of magnetic field .",
    "although the initial energy of @xmath50 component was increased by more than twice ( resulting in its @xmath119 depletion ) no significant change in populations and other properties was found . in particular , the magnetization curves ( fig . [ magn ] ) look the same .",
    "this result acts in favour of dipolar resonances based scenario .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the dynamics of a spinor chromium condensate in low magnetic fields .",
    "we found out that the condensate dynamics has a resonant character .",
    "the appearance of dipolar resonances seems to be a common phenomenon in ultracold atomic gases in low magnetic fields .",
    "we show that already observed experimentally phenomena of appearance of a threshold in spin relaxation @xcite and of spontaneous demagnetization @xcite , in fact , both occur because of existence of dipolar resonances . in both cases",
    "the initial stage of the evolution is resonant which is so because of the presence of quantized vortices in populated zeeman components . in the case of @xmath92 plaquette",
    "we still observe vortices in @xmath57 component in each plaquette site even though these sites are not axially symmetric .",
    "this is related to the fact that we have large number of atoms in each lattice site ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the discussion of the role of the trap anisotropy in the spin relaxation processes )",
    ". the resonant evolution of a condensate is , however , terminated after a few milliseconds . on this time",
    "scale mechanisms like tunneling and thermalization , which destroy vortices , come into play .",
