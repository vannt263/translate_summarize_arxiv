    "friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetimes are among the most popular backgrounds in gravitational physics .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "first of all current observations give a strong motivation for the adoption of the cosmological principle stating that at large scales the universe is homogeneous and isotropic and , hence , its large - scale structure is well described by the frw metric .",
    "another motivation for the interest to frw geometries is related to the high symmetry of these backgrounds . due this symmetry",
    "numerous physical problems are exactly solvable and a better understanding of physical effects in frw models could serve as a handle to deal with more complicated geometries .",
    "in particular , the investigation of quantum effects at the early stages of the cosmological expansion has been a subject of study in many research papers ( see , for example , birr82,grib94 and references therein ) .",
    "the original motivations in this research were mainly to avoid the initial singularity and to solve the initial conditions problem for the dynamics of the universe .",
    "the further increase of the interest to this topic was related to the appearance of inflationary cosmological scenarios @xcite . during an inflationary epoch ,",
    "quantum fluctuations introduce inhomogeneities and may affect the transition toward the true vacuum .",
    "these fluctuations provide a mechanism which explains the origin of the primordial density perturbation needed to explain the formation of the large - scale structure in the universe .    in many problems we need to consider the physical model on the background of manifolds with compact spatial dimensions . in particular , the idea of compact extra dimensions has been extensively used in supergravity and superstring theories . from an inflationary point of view , universes with compact dimensions , under certain conditions , should be considered a rule rather than an exception @xcite .",
    "the models of a compact universe with non - trivial topology may play important roles by providing proper initial conditions for inflation .",
    "the quantum creation of the universe having toroidal spatial topology is discussed in @xcite and in references @xcite within the framework of various supergravity theories . in the case of non - trivial topology ,",
    "the boundary conditions imposed on quantum fields give rise to the modification of the spectrum for vacuum fluctuations and , as a result , to the casimir - type contributions in the vacuum expectation values of physical observables ( for the topological casimir effect and its role in cosmology see @xcite and references therein ) . in the kaluza - klein - type models ,",
    "the topological casimir effect has been used as a stabilization mechanism for moduli fields which parametrize the size and the shape of the extra dimensions .",
    "recently , the relevance of the casimir energy as a model for dark energy needed for the explanation of the present accelerated expansion of the universe has been pointed out ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in most work on the topological casimir effect in cosmological backgrounds ,",
    "the results for the corresponding static counterparts were used replacing the static length scales by comoving lengths in the cosmological bulk .",
    "this procedure is valid in conformally invariant situations or under the assumption of a quasi - adiabatic approximation . for non - conformal fields",
    "the calculations should be done directly within the framework of quantum field theory on time - dependent backgrounds . in a series of recent papers",
    "we have considered the topological casimir effect for a massive scalar field with general curvature coupling @xcite and for massive fermionic field @xcite in background of the de sitter spacetime with toroidally compactified spatial dimensions . due to the high symmetry of the de sitter spacetime in both cases the corresponding problems are exactly soluble .    in the present paper",
    "we will consider another exactly soluble problem for the topological casimir effect on background of a more general class of spacetimes .",
    "namely , we investigate the vacuum expectation values of the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor for a massless scalar field with arbitrary curvature coupling parameter induced by the compactness of spatial dimensions in spatially flat frw universes where the scale factor is a power of the comoving time . the vacuum polarization and the particle creation in the frw cosmological models with trivial topology have been considered in a large number of papers ( see @xcite and references therein for early research and @xcite-@xcite and references therein for later developments ) . in particular ,",
    "the vacuum expectation values of the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor in models with power law scale factors have been discussed in bord97,bord98,@xcite-@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the expectation value of the field squared is the crucial quantity in discussions of the topological mass generation as a result of one - loop quantum corrections and dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "it also is of interest in considerations of phase transitions in the early universe , in particular , related to inflationary scenarios .",
    "in addition to describing the physical structure of the quantum field at a given point , the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor acts as the source of gravity in the einstein equations .",
    "it therefore plays an important role in modelling a self - consistent dynamics involving the gravitational field .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we evaluate the positive - frequency wightman function in spatially flat frw model with topology @xmath0 . by using the abel - plana summation formula",
    ", we decompose this function into two parts : the first one is the corresponding function in the geometry of the uncompactified frw spacetime and the second one is induced by the compactness of the spatial dimensions . in section [ sec : vevphi2 ] we use the wightman function for the evaluation of the vacuum expectation value of the field squared .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the topological part is investigated in the early and late stages of the cosmological evolution . in section [ sec : emt ] we consider the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the part in this expectation value corresponding to the uncompactified frw model is well investigated in the literature and we are mainly concerned with the topological part .",
    "the special case of the model with a single compact dimension and the corresponding numerical results are discussed in section [ sec : special ] .",
