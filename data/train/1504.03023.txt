    "such measurements are highly sensitive to variations of parameters that determine the experiment s performance during long periods ( i.e. several hours ) and which may cause systematic uncertainties . in particular , such effects may arise from interactions of the ion with background gas .",

    "the trap for ba@xmath2 in this experiment is a hyperbolic paul trap @xcite .",
    "it consists of a ring electrode and two end caps made of copper .",
    "the electrodes are mounted on a macor holder .",
    "the chosen geometry results in a harmonic pseudopotential at the center of the trap when ac voltages are applied between the ring and the two endcaps .",
    "the latter are grounded .",
    "the operating rf frequency for the trap is @xmath5 = 5.44  mhz .",
    "the trap with its macor holder is mounted on oxygen free high conductivity ( ofhc ) copper base plate . in order to trap ions , there is a ba oven ( 0.9 mm diameter @xmath6 40 mm length resistively heated stainless steel tube ) which contains a mixture of baco@xmath7 and zr .",

    "ba@xmath2 ions have a closed three - level system .",
    "one of the excited states , the 5d@xmath0d@xmath1 state , is long - lived ( see fig .",

    "observing the fluorescence from the 6p@xmath0p@xmath9 - 6s@xmath0s@xmath9 transition implies that the ion is `` not shelved '' in the 5d@xmath0d@xmath1 state .",
    "the electron shelving technique is employed in our experiment to determine the lifetime of the 5d@xmath0d@xmath1 state . with an additional fiber - coupled high power led ( m455f1 ) at @xmath15  nm wavelength the ion can be `` shelved '' to the 5d@xmath0d@xmath1 state via excitation to the 6p@xmath0p@xmath10 state and this state s subsequent decay . the direct observation of `` quantum jumps '' in a single ba@xmath2 ion between the 5d@xmath0d@xmath1 and 6s@xmath0s@xmath9 states has been first demonstrated by nagourney et al . @xcite .",
    "the decay of the 6p@xmath0p@xmath10 state is the start of a shelving period which ends with a quantum jump from the 5d@xmath0d@xmath1 state to 6s@xmath0s@xmath9 state .",
