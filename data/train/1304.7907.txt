    "the search for new physics is one of the top priorities after a particle consistent with the higgs boson has been found at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "although this discovery can elucidate the mass - generation mechanism , it is still believed that the standard model ( sm ) is not the ultimate truth , and that physics beyond it must exist at the tev scale .",
    "new phenomena are predicted in various alternative models and theoretical extensions from sm .",
    "the existence of a new neutral current , called @xmath2 , is a common feature of most of these models .    among the models that have new physics content ,",
    "the 3 - 3 - 1 model is the one that provides an elegant answer to one of the modern intriguing questions , the problem of fermion families in nature .",
    "the model is built so that anomalies cancel out when all families are summed over , so the family number must be a multiple of the color number .",
    "the phenomenological consequences of the 3 - 3 - 1 model depend on its version",
    ". the different versions of this model are a consequence of the characteristics of the @xmath5 matrices .",
    "it is well known that two representations of the group generators can be simultaneously diagonalized .",
    "this makes the charge operator dependent on the ratio between @xmath6 to @xmath7 matrix representations leading to different model versions .",
    "there is a version with an extra neutral @xmath2 and charged @xmath8 and @xmath9 gauge bosons carrying double leptonic charge , called bileptons .",
    "moreover , in this version the @xmath2 width can be large , and it is usually called the minimal version of the model @xcite .",
    "there are two versions of the model where there are no exotic charged quarks , one is called the right - handed neutrino version @xcite and the other we call the zer version @xcite . for both , the @xmath2 is a narrow resonance . as we will discuss in the next section ,",
    "the properties of the new neutral boson depend on the model version , which is determined by the charge operator .",
    "consequently , one needs to establish phenomenological criteria to disentangle these versions by analyzing the production cross section and some angular distributions that follow from each of them .",
    "several studies have been performed in order to derive bounds on the mass of new gauge bosons .",
    "these bounds come from either direct experimental searches or from phenomenological analysis using the available experimental data . in the universe of the 3 - 3 - 1 model ,",
    "bounds on @xmath10 were obtained from different analyses , such as the contribution from exotics to the oblique electroweak correction parameters ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) @xcite , corrections to the @xmath0-pole observables for arbitrary values of @xmath14 @xcite , the study of the energy region where perturbative treatment is still valid @xcite , @xmath2 and exotic boson mass contributions to the muon decay parameters @xcite , the decay @xmath15 @xcite , and the contribution from neutral bosons to the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xcite .    in the original work from f. pisano and v. pleitez @xcite , a very restrictive bound on @xmath2 mass was obtained ( @xmath16 tev ) by considering the contribution from the @xmath2 to the @xmath17 mass difference .",
    "more recently , a work from v. pleitez _",
    "@xcite , based on additional contributions from a light scalar boson to fcnc , lowered the strong previous limit on the new neutral gauge boson for the minimal version of the 3 - 3 - 1 model .",
    "this new result allows the minimal 3 - 3 - 1 model predictions to be probed at lhc .",
    "direct experimental searches performed by d  @xcite and cdf @xcite collaborations derived bounds on @xmath2 mass based on analyses with dielectron and dimuon final states at @xmath18 tev .",
    "they established lower bounds for different models and had excluded a @xmath2 with mass in the range from @xmath19 to @xmath20 gev .",
    "recently , the atlas and cms collaborations presented results on narrow resonances with dilepton final states ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) @xcite and excluded a sequential standard model @xmath2 with mass smaller than @xmath23 tev ( atlas ) and @xmath24 tev ( cms ) . although their data have been interpreted in terms of different scenarios for physics beyond the sm , no limits on the @xmath2 from the 3 - 3 - 1 model was derived from the latest lhc results .",
    "the purpose of this article is to derive these unknown limits .    in this paper",
    "we consider the production and decay of the 3 - 3 - 1 @xmath2 in the process @xmath3",
    "( @xmath25 ) for different lhc energy regimes , when @xmath2 is a narrow resonance as predicted in two versions of the model , namely , the right - handed neutrino model ( rhn ) @xcite and the zer model @xcite .",
    "studies using cdf results have excluded a @xmath2 from the rhn model with mass below @xmath26 gev @xcite . for the zer model ,",
    "no limit on @xmath2 mass has been derived so far .",
    "a previous study on @xmath2 at the ilc energies was made by one of the authors , where it was possible to disentangle versions from the 3 - 3 - 1 model , considering the process @xmath27 and establishing from hadronic final states lower bounds on @xmath10 with @xmath28 c. l. @xcite . the possibility to see signals from these models",
    "will considerably increased at the lhc running at @xmath4 tev , a scenario that we also explore in this work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we describe the right - handed neutrinos and zer versions , highlighting the differences between them . in sec .",
    "iii we present the @xmath2 width and the total cross section for the process investigated and for different @xmath2 masses . in secs .",
    "iv and v , we derive lower bounds on the @xmath2 mass at @xmath29 and @xmath30 tev and explore the lhc potential to find this new state at @xmath4 tev .",
    "the conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "the 3 - 3 - 1 model has many attractive features : among them , it is free from anomalies considering the number of fermion families equal to the quantum number of color .",
    "the beginning is the electric charge operator that defines the version of the model , @xmath31 where the two generators @xmath32 and @xmath33 satisfy the @xmath5 algebra , @xmath34 is the unit matrix , and finally , @xmath35 is the @xmath36 charge .    depending upon the @xmath14 value ,",
    "the charge operator determines the arrangement of the fields for he minimal version @xmath37 ; @xmath38 leads to a model with right - handed neutrinos ( rhn ) and quarks with ordinary charges . also another choice",
    ", @xmath39 leads to a model without exotic charges .",
    "we are interested in the two following versions : the right - handed neutrino version with @xmath38 called here version i @xcite , and the version with @xmath39 @xcite , called version ii .    both versions present , besides the ordinary gauge bosons ( @xmath40 ) , neutral extra gauge bosons @xmath2 and single charged bileptons @xmath8 and neutral one @xmath41 , which carry a double lepton number .",
    "the heavy exotic quarks carry ordinary charges , @xmath42 for u - type and @xmath43 for d - type .",
    "each lepton family is arranged in triplets ; the first two elements are the charged and the neutral lepton and the third element is a conjugate of the charged lepton or neutral lepton , depending on the @xmath14 factor . in order to cancel anomalies , the quarks are arranged in triplets and antitriplets ( one family must be different from the other two ) .",
    "the higgs structure to give mass to all particles is composed of three triplets ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) , whose neutral fields develop nonzero vacuum expectation values , respectively , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . to reproduce the sm phenomenology , a large scale is associated to the vacuum expectation value @xmath50 , which gives mass to the exotic quarks and extra gauge bosons .",
    "thus we have the conditions @xmath51 , with @xmath52 gev@xmath53 .",

    "the two versions of 3 - 3 - 1 models discussed above were implemented in the comphep package @xcite , which was used for cross - section calculation and event generation .",
    "the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) cteq6l were used and the qcd factorization scale was set as the dilepton invariant mass of the event . concerning the particle parameters , we considered heavy quarks , heavy leptons , and bileptons masses to be @xmath75 tev , and we took the @xmath2 mass in the range from @xmath76 to @xmath77 gev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present the total @xmath2 width as a function of its mass for the two versions studied here . as we can see , the resonance is narrow in both versions , varying from @xmath78 to @xmath79 of @xmath10 in the mass range considered . at @xmath80 tev the slope of the curve increases because , from this point , the decay of @xmath2 into exotic quarks becomes kinematically allowed . in both versions , the new neutral gauge boson can also decay into exotic fermions with branching ratios of order of @xmath78 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the total cross section calculated at tree level for the process @xmath3 at @xmath81 tev , where @xmath82 is either an electron or a muon .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the same cross section calculated for @xmath4 tev .",
    "both versions foresee cross sections that can to be probed at the lhc .",
    "version ii is the most optimistic since the @xmath2 coupling to leptons is stronger than in version i. note that depending on @xmath10 , the cross sections increase by a factor of @xmath83 to @xmath84 at @xmath4 tev in comparison with their value at @xmath85 tev .",
    "the lhc experiments have performed many analyses searching for signals of new spin @xmath75 gauge bosons in different final states , but so far no deviation of sm has been found .",
    "these analyses are usually model dependent , where a set of benchmark model predictions are compared to data .    in the absence of any signal , atlas and cms collaborations",
    "have extended the @xmath87 superstring - inspired @xmath2 exclusion mass to above @xmath88 tev with @xmath89 fb@xmath90 and @xmath91 fb@xmath90 of collision data , respectively , at @xmath81 tev @xcite .",
    "in particular , the cms collaboration has combined the results from @xmath92 and @xmath85 tev to set @xmath28 c. l. limits on the ratio @xmath93 of the cross section times branching fraction for @xmath2 to that of the sm ,    @xmath94    we use the cms results to set lower limits on the @xmath2 mass from 3 - 3 - 1 models .",
    "following what was done by cms , the @xmath2 cross - sections for both versions are calculated in a range of @xmath95 about the @xmath2 pole mass and the @xmath0 cross - section is calculated in the interval @xmath96 gev @xmath97 gev .",
    "the ratio @xmath93 is evaluated for @xmath2 masses in the range between @xmath76 and @xmath98 gev .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the cms observed limits and the theoretical ratio @xmath93 curve for both versions .",
    "the @xmath2 lower mass limit is obtained from the point where the theoretical ratio curve crosses the observed limit . from the plot",
    ", we can conclude that the current data exclude with @xmath28 c. l. the version i new neutral gauge boson with mass below @xmath99 gev and the version ii new resonance lighter than @xmath100 gev .",
    "this result does not change significantly if the value of exotic quark mass is changed .",
    "after a shutdown in 2013 that is expected to take two years , the lhc will restart its operation at the design center - of - mass energy of @xmath4 tev . here",
    "we assume this scenario to investigate the lhc potential to find a @xmath2 from the 3 - 3 - 1 model and determine the lower bounds on the @xmath2 mass that can be set with this energy regime .    in order to determine the minimal integrated luminosity needed to claim a @xmath2 discovery or to exclude it ,",
    "the number of background and signal events expected in the processes @xmath102 and @xmath103 are calculated . to make our results more realistic",
    ", we consider an overall efficiency of @xmath104 for the electron channel and @xmath105 for the muon channel , as determined by the atlas experiment @xcite .",
    "these efficiencies take into account the geometrical acceptance of the detector ( @xmath106 ) , cuts on lepton transverse momentum and lepton reconstruction and identification efficiencies .",
    "the dominant and irreducible background taken into account in this paper is the drell - yan ( dy ) process .",
    "although the @xmath2 interfere with the @xmath107 process , the interference is minimal , and therefore we treat signal and background as independent .",
    "other backgrounds include qcd jets and ttbar events , but at high masses these backgrounds can be heavily suppressed by isolation cuts and are not considered here .",
    "figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] show the invariant mass distributions for the dy and for a signal mass hypothesis of 3000 gev for versions i and ii , considering @xmath108 fb@xmath90 of data and the efficiencies mentioned above . only the distribution for the electron channel",
    "is shown , but at the generator level the muon channel distributions looks the same . to determine the significance of a signal such as those shown in the plots",
    ", we estimate the number of signal and background events by calculating the cross sections within a window @xmath109 $ ] for both channels .",
    "this selection , represented by the two vertical lines in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , suppresses considerably the background while maintaining high signal efficiency .",
    "we can also see in these plots the effect of @xmath2-dy interference on the invariant mass , which is small in both models , and under the selected mass window around the @xmath2 mass , it is highly suppressed .",
    "the potential of the search to find a @xmath110 of a given mass is determined by the integrated luminosity needed to observe a signal with statistical significance of @xmath111 .",
    "the significance is obtained via the estimator @xcite ,    @xmath112    where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are , respectively , the number of signal and backgrounds events expected in the mass window mentioned above .    figures [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] show the amount of integrated luminosity required to have a 5@xmath115 @xmath2 discovery in the electron and muon channels for both versions .",
    "as we can see , a 3 - 3 - 1 @xmath2 with mass just above the exclusion limit ( @xmath100 gev ) can be reached with an amount of data of order of @xmath75 fb@xmath90 to @xmath83 fb@xmath90 , depending on the channel and model .",
    "this scenario can be achieved in the first year of lhc operation at @xmath4 tev . for @xmath116 tev in version",
    "ii , the amount of data required to discover this new heavy state would be less than @xmath108 fb@xmath90 , while for version i , at least @xmath117 fb@xmath90 of data would be needed to observe a boson with that mass .",
    "if no resonance is found in the data , the current @xmath2 limits can be considerably extended in the next years .",
    "assuming the presence of only background in the data , we can calculate the expected limits on various @xmath2 mass hypotheses considering different integrated luminosities .",
    "this is done by performing a single - bin likelihood analysis , using the estimated number of signal and background events and the algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "it adopts a frequentist approach to compute the confidence level for exclusion of small signals by combining different searches .",
    "the electron and muon channels are combined to set @xmath28 c. l. exclusion on @xmath118 , and these limits are translated to limits on @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] shows the minimal integrated luminosity needed to exclude the new gauge boson as a function of @xmath10 . with @xmath119 fb@xmath90 of data , the version ii @xmath2 can be excluded up to masses of @xmath77 gev , but for version i",
    ", it would need at least @xmath120 times more luminosity to exclude a @xmath2 with mass of @xmath77 gev .",
    "note that for @xmath121 gev , less than @xmath83 fb@xmath90 of data is enough for exclusion .",
    "this is important to point out because , although we have not considered in this work the 3 - 3 - 1 version that has theoretical upper bounds on @xmath2 , our results suggest that such a version can be completely excluded in the very early stages of lhc running at @xmath4 tev , since these upper bounds are usually below @xmath122 gev .",
    "new resonances are expected to manifest at lhc in the next years , and among them , the neutral heavy gauge boson @xmath2 has a special role since it appears in different beyond - sm scenarios . in this paper",
    "we have presented a study involving the 3 - 3 - 1 model predictions , considering the process @xmath3 .",
    "lower limits on @xmath2 mass from two versions of the 3 - 3 - 1 model were derived using the latest cms published results . for the rhn model , a @xmath2 with mass below @xmath99 gev is excluded .",
    "this limit is a considerable improvement of the bounds obtained with cdf results . on the other hand",
    ", we derived a first limit for the zer version : a @xmath2 lighter than @xmath100 gev is excluded .",
    "considering the lhc running at the design center - of - mass energy of @xmath4 tev , we have shown that a new resonance with mass of @xmath77 gev can be reached at lhc with integrated luminosities of order of @xmath108 fb@xmath90 . on the other hand ,",
    "if no signal is found , the lhc can already exclude @xmath123 gev in the first year of operation at the high - energy regime .",
    "this is the first investigation of this kind performed for the 3 - 3 - 1 models considering the lhc upgraded energy .",
    "as the 3 - 3 - 1 model predicts a number of new particles , the observation of a @xmath2 in combination with other exotic searches like bileptons and leptoquarks would provide a powerful way of discriminating between 3 - 3 - 1 versions and other bsm scenarios with new neutral heavy states .",

    "<S> the large hadron collider will restart with higher energy and luminosity in 2015 . </S>",
    "<S> this achievement opens the possibility of discovering new phenomena hardly described by the standard model , that is based on two neutral gauge bosons : the photon and the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this perspective imposes a deep and systematic study of models that predicts the existence of new neutral gauge bosons . </S>",
    "<S> one of these models is based on the gauge group @xmath1 called the 3 - 3 - 1 model for short .    in this paper we perform a study with @xmath2 predicted in two versions of the 3 - 3 - 1 model and compare the signature of this resonance in each model version . by considering the present and future lhc energy regimes , we obtain some distributions and the total cross section for the process @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we derive lower bounds on @xmath2 mass from the latest lhc results . </S>",
    "<S> finally we analyze the lhc potential for discovering this neutral gauge boson at @xmath4 tev center - of - mass energy . </S>"
