    "[ fig3 ] , we compare the companion s mass - radius relation with the theoretical relation for low - mass hydrogen main sequence stars @xcite . an ordinary hydrogen - rich companion is consistent with the required relation for a mass @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , although this value has a small a priori probability of 7% for an isotropic sample of binary inclinations .",
    "we note , however , that bloating of a hydrogen - rich companion owing to x - ray heating could allow a somewhat less massive companion to fill its roche lobe @xcite , permitting a slightly larger inclination angle with a higher a priori probability .",
    "a hydrogen main sequence companion is also consistent with the observed h and he lines in the optical spectra @xcite , whereas a white dwarf companion can be excluded as too small to fill its roche lobe for any plausible donor mass .",
    "we can check the consistency of our above methods using the brightness of the optical counterpart . @xcite",
    "found that the magnitude of the optical outburst and the orbital period of soft x - ray transients are strongly correlated .",
    "using the relation they derive gives @xmath57 for xte j1814@xmath0338 , and , since the counterpart in outburst is @xmath58 , a quiescent magnitude of @xmath59 .",
    "assuming @xmath60 due to galactic dust along the line of sight @xcite , and a minimum distance of 6.4 kpc ( corresponding to the lower limit of the distance estimate derived from the radius expansion burst , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we estimate a limit on the absolute magnitude of a main - sequence companion of @xmath61 .",
    "we used the empirical mass - luminosity relation presented in @xcite to determine a minimum companion mass of @xmath62 ( corresponding to @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) .",
    "this companion mass is significantly lower than the value derived from the period - density relationship , and would imply that the companion star is significantly bloated due to x - ray heating . however , we note that increasing the assumed distance to xte j1814@xmath0338  will increase the minimum companion mass and decrease the maximum inclination angle .",
    "it is also instructive to consider what we can infer about the system given the @xmath65 magnitude limit of the companion in quiescence .",
    "we again assume @xmath66 , and infer a value of @xmath67 ( given @xmath68 ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we use the upper limit on the distance derived from the radius expansion burst of 9.6 kpc to give an absolute magnitude of @xmath69 .",
    "this corresponds to a main - sequence spectral type of later than m1 v and a mass of @xmath70 ( corresponding to @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) .",
    "using the harmonic properties of the burst oscillations , @xcite were able to derive 90% confidence intervals of @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this range is in agreement with our determination of the inclination angle from the magnitude limit of the optical counterpart ( @xmath71 ) and lack of x - ray eclipse ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "however , their lower limit of @xmath76 is a bit higher than the value we calculate given the mass - radius relation for an ordinary main - sequence companion of @xmath77 , again suggesting that the companion may be bloated as a result of x - ray heating .",
    "we would expect the optical emission from xte j1814@xmath0338  to originate from the combination of an x - ray  heated accretion disk and companion .",
    "a simple x - ray  heated accretion disk model @xcite is able to account for the observed @xmath17 magnitudes for a wide range of plausible parameters , although the lack of data at bluer wavelengths precludes a well - constrained fit .",
    "however , this model is unable to account for the @xmath78-band data , which are systematically brighter than predicted .",
    "( for a plot of the optical data with a representative x - ray  heated accretion disk model , see figure  [ opt_flux ] . )",
    "although we do not have infrared data for xte j1814@xmath0338 , the sharp increase in flux in the @xmath78-band data suggests an ir excess with respect to the x - ray  heated disk model , similar to what was seen in the accretion - powered millisecond pulsar sax j1808.43658 @xcite .",
    "first , let us consider the possibility that this emission arises from the companion : if we take its @xmath30-band magnitude to be @xmath7 ( the limiting magnitude for its non - detection in quiescence ) , and assume it to be an m - dwarf ( in agreement with previous mass estimates ) , this corresponds to an @xmath78-band magnitude of @xmath79 ( again assuming @xmath80 to obtain @xmath81 ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although the companion could brighten due to x - ray heating during the outburst , in order for it to account for the excess flux , it would have to brighten to @xmath82 , corresponding to a more than 30-fold increase in flux from quiescence .",
    "we consider this to be highly unlikely .",
    "furthermore , if the secondary were substantially heated , its surface brightness would be highly anisotropic , and we would expect to see @xmath78-band variability at the timescale of the orbital period . the 4.3-hour orbit is well - sampled on 21 june 2003 , but we note that there is actually less variability at longer wavelengths ( the percent rms in @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath30 , and @xmath78 is 11% , 9% , 6% and 4% , respectively . )",
    "an alternative possibility is that the @xmath78-band excess could originate from synchrotron emission related to the outburst ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "future observations of xte j1814@xmath0338  in outburst spanning a large spectral range , including measurements in the visible as well as at ir and radio wavelengths , would further our understanding of the geometry and emission mechanisms of xte j1814@xmath0338 .",
