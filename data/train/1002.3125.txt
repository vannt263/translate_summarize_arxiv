    "a many - body theory approach developed by the authors ( gribakin and ludlow 2004 ) takes into account all main correlation effects in positron - atom interactions .",
    "these are polarization of the atomic system by the positron , virtual positronium formation and enhancement of the electron - positron contact density due to their coulomb attraction .",
    "the first two effects are crucial for an accurate description of positron - atom scattering and the third one is very important for calculating positron annihilation rates . in this paper we apply our method to calculate the energies and annihilation rates for positron bound states with the hydrogen and halogen negative ions .",
    "positron bound states can have a strong effect on positron annihilation with matter .",
    "for example , positron bound states with molecules give rise to vibrational feshbach resonances , which leads to a strong enhancement of the positron annihilation rates in many polyatomic molecular gases ( gribakin 2000 , 2001 , gilbert 2002 , gribakin 2010 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the question of positron binding with neutral atoms or molecules has been answered in the affirmative only recently , and the ubiquity of such states is only becoming clear now ( dzuba 1995 , ryzhikh and mitroy 1997 , mitroy 2001 , 2002 , danielson 2009 ) . on the other hand , it has been known for many decades that positrons bind to negative ions . beyond the electron - positron",
    "bound state , or positronium ( ps ) , the simplest atomic system capable of binding the positron is the negative hydrogen ion ( ore 1951 ) .",
    "the binding energy , annihilation rate and structure of the resulting compound , positronium hydride ( psh ) have now been calculated to very high precision , e.g. , by variational methods ( frolov 1997 ) .",
    "the information available for heavier negative ions with many valence electrons is not nearly as accurate ( see schrader and moxom 2001 for a useful review ) .",
    "positronium halides have received most of the attention , with some calculations dating back fifty years ; see , e.g. , the hartree - fock calculations of simons ( 1953 ) and cade and farazdel ( 1977 ) , quantum monte - carlo work by schrader ( 1992a , 1993 ) , and more recent configuration interaction results ( saito 1995 , 2005 , saito and hidao 1998 , miura and saito 2003 ) .    at first glance , the physics of positron binding to negative ions is much simpler than that of positron binding to neutrals .",
    "the driving force here is the coulomb attraction between the particles .",
    "however , in contrast with atoms , the electron binding energy in a negative ion ( i.e. , the electron affinity , @xmath1 ) is always smaller than the binding energy of ps , @xmath2  ev .",
    "this means that the lowest dissociation threshold in the positron - anion system is that of the neutral atom and ps , so that the positron bound to a negative ion may still escape by ps emission .",
    "hence , for the system to be truly bound , its energy should lie _ below _ the ps - atom threshold , and the positron energy in the bound state , @xmath3 , must satisfy @xmath4 at large positron - target separations @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the dipole polarizability of the target .",
    "the method should thus be capable of describing many - electron correlation effects .",
    "the halogen negative ions have @xmath7 valence configurations , and are similar to noble - gas atoms . here",
    "many - body theory may have an advantage over few - body methods ( dzuba 1996 ) .",
    "the many - body theory approach developed by the authors ( gribakin and ludlow 2004 ) , employs b - spline basis sets .",
    "this enables the sum of the electron - positron ladder diagram sequence , or vertex function , to be found exactly .",
    "this vertex function accounts for virtual ps formation .",
    "it is incorporated into the diagrams for the positron correlation potential and correlation corrections to the electron - positron annihilation vertex . to ensure convergence with respect to the maximum orbital angular momentum of the intermediate electron and positron states in the diagrams , @xmath8 , we use extrapolation .",
    "it is based on the known asymptotic behaviour of the energies and annihilation rates as functions of @xmath8 ( gribakin and ludlow 2002 ) .    in gribakin and ludlow ( 2004 ) the theory has been successfully applied to positron scattering and annihilation on hydrogen below the ps formation threshold , where the present formalism is exact .",
    "this theory is now extended to treat the more difficult problem of positron interaction with multielectron atomic negative ions .",
    "we test the method for h@xmath9 , and consider the halogen negative ions f@xmath9 , cl@xmath9 , br@xmath9 and i@xmath9 .",
    "note that a conventional notation for the positron bound with a negative ion @xmath10 is ps@xmath11 , rather than @xmath12 , hence one has psh , psf , etc .",
    "( schrader 1998 ) .",
    "the many - body theory method for positron bound states is similar to that developed for electron - atom binding in negative ions ( chernysheva 1988 , johnson 1989 , gribakin 1990 , dzuba 1994 ) , and used for positron - atom bound states by dzuba ( 1995 ) .",
    "the green function of the positron interacting with a many - electron system ( `` target '' ) satisfies the dyson equation ( see , e.g. , migdal 1967 ) , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the zeroth - order positron hamiltonian , and @xmath15 is the _ self - energy_. a convenient choice of @xmath14 is that of the positron moving in the field of the hartree - fock ( hf ) target ground state .",
    "the self - energy then describes the correlation interaction between the positron and the target beyond the static - field hf approximation ( bell and squires 1959 ) .",
    "it can be calculated by means of the many - body diagrammatic expansion in powers of the electron - positron and electron - electron coulomb interactions ( see below ) .",
    "if the positron is capable of binding to the system , i.e. , the target has a positive positron affinity @xmath16 , the positron green function @xmath17 has a pole at @xmath18 , @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the quasiparticle wavefunction which describes the bound - state positron .",
    "it is equal to the projection of the total ground - state wavefunction of the positron and @xmath21 electrons , @xmath22 , onto the target ground - state wavefunction , @xmath23 , @xmath24 the normalization integral for @xmath25 , @xmath26 can be interpreted as the probability that the electronic subsystem of the positron - target complex remains in its ground state .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath27 quantifies the extent to which the structure of the complex is that of the positron bound to the anion , @xmath12 , as opposed to that of the ps atom orbiting the neutral atom .",
    "such separation is a feature of the `` heuristic wavefunction model '' ( mitroy 2002 ) .",
    "if the former component dominates the wavefunction , the value of @xmath27 is expected to be be close to unity . if , on the other hand , the wavefunction contains a large `` ps cluster '' component , the value of @xmath27 will be notably smaller .    by taking the limit @xmath28 in equation ( [ eq : dys ] ) , one obtains the dyson equation for the quasiparticle wavefunction @xmath25 ( `` dyson orbital '' ) and the bound - state energy @xmath3",
    ", @xmath29 this equation is analogous to the standard schrdinger eigenvalue problem , except that the correlation potential @xmath30 depends on the energy .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath31 of the hamiltonian @xmath14 , @xmath32 are characterized by their energies @xmath33 and the orbital angular momentum @xmath34 , implicit in this notation .",
    "they form a complete single - particle positron basis set . for negative ions",
    "the spectrum of @xmath14 consists of both discrete ( rydberg ) and continuum states .",
    "this set can be used to expand the quasiparticle bound - state wavefunction , @xmath35 and cast the dyson equation ( [ eq : dyson ] ) in the matrix form , @xmath36 where the sums in equations ( [ eq : expand ] ) and ( [ eq : dyson1 ] ) include the positive - energy continuum , as well as the discrete negative - energy states , and @xmath37    in practice the continuum is discretized by using a b - spline basis set ( see below ) , and equation ( [ eq : dyson1 ] ) becomes a matrix eigenvalue problem .",
    "therefore , to find @xmath3 and @xmath38 one simply needs to diagonalize the matrix , @xmath39 its lowest eigenvalue @xmath40 depends on the energy @xmath41 at which @xmath42 is calculated , and the diagonalization must be repeated several times until self - consistency is achieved : @xmath43 . knowing the dependence of the eigenvalue on @xmath41 allows one to determine the normalization integral , equation ( [ eq : norm ] ) , via the relation ( migdal 1967 ) , @xmath44 note that owing to the spherical symmetry of the target , the states @xmath45 and @xmath46 have definite orbital angular momenta . to find the bound positron ground state it is sufficient to calculate the self - energy matrix ( [ eq : sigmat ] ) for the @xmath47-wave positron only .",
    "the accuracy of the binding energy obtained from the dyson equation depends upon the accuracy to which the self - energy has been determined . as mentioned in the introduction , polarization of the target and virtual ps formation",
    "are the two most important effects that need to be accounted for .",
    "the effect of target polarization is described in the leading order by the 2nd - order diagram @xmath48 , figure [ fig : sig_2ps](a ) .",
    "following gribakin and ludlow ( 2004 ) , the ps formation contribution @xmath49 shown in figure  [ fig : sig_2ps](b ) , is obtained by summing the electron - positron ladder diagram series to all orders , figure  [ fig : lad ] .",

    "a set of 3rd - order diagrams shown in figure [ fig : sig_3 ] will be included .",
    "diagrams ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) represent corrections to the 2nd - order polarization diagram , of the type described by the random - phase approximation with exchange ( rpae , amusia 1975 )",
    ". they account for the electron - hole interaction and screening of the positron coulomb field , and correct the value of the dipole polarizability @xmath6 of the target .",
    "diagram ( e ) accounts for the positron - hole repulsion .",
    "the contribution of the diagrams in figure [ fig : sig_3 ] is denoted collectively by @xmath52 .",
    "calculation of these diagrams will allow us to gauge the importance of these corrections , and even to include effectively higher - order diagrams ( see below ) .    .",
    "mirror images of the diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) are also included .",
    "the top line describes the positron.,width=593 ]    of course , any many - body theory calculation can at best include only dominant classes of diagrams , leaving out an infinite number of other higher - order diagrams .",
    "for example , the diagram in figure [ fig : sig_gam_cor ] has the effect of screening the positron - electron interaction accompanying virtual ps formation in @xmath53 , figure [ fig : sig_2ps](b ) .",
    ".,width=188 ]    the number of diagrams increases rapidly as one moves to higher orders .",
    "the effort required to evaluate these diagrams becomes prohibitive relative to their small contribution .",
    "it would therefore be useful to find a simple method to estimate the contribution of the higher - order diagrams .",
    "this will allow us to take into account the effect of electron screening beyond the corrections shown in figure [ fig : sig_3 ] .",
    "a useful quantity for estimating the size of a contribution to the self - energy @xmath30 is a dimensionless measure of its `` strength '' ( dzuba 1994 ) , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the 0th order positron green function calculated at @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 be the ratio of the strength of the sum of the 3rd - order polarization diagrams ( figure [ fig : sig_3 ] ) to the strength of the 2nd - order polarization diagram .",
    "this quantity @xmath58 can then be used to estimate higher - order contributions to @xmath53 .    as a check",
    ", we test that the binding energy obtained using @xmath59 is close to that obtained with @xmath60 multiplied by @xmath61 , i.e. , using @xmath62 an estimate of the _ total _ self - energy corrected for the screening effects in the lowest order can then be obtained as @xmath63 .\\ ] ]    as we will see in section [ sec : num ] , the relative effect of screening is negative , @xmath64 , which means that screening reduces the magnitude of the self - energy .",
    "similar higher - order terms in the self - energy expansion will alternate in sign .",

    "the estimate of the psf binding energy was obtained from the observation that when a hydrogen atom in benzene is replaced by fluorine , the fraction of positrons annihilating with the longest lifetime , as ortho - positronium , was reduced from 40 to 27% .",
