    "powerful radio emission is rare in the population of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "this phenomenon , only found in about 10% of the agns , is associated with the presence of relativistic particles produced in the central regions of the agn , and then channelled through the jets out to distances of hundreds of kpc up to a few mpc .",
    "such relativistic particles are responsible for the synchrotron radiation at the origin of the radio emission .",

    "indeed , all the @xmath2-ray agn detected by egret are radio - loud sources , strongly supporting this scenario .",
    "no radio - quiet agns were firmly detected in @xmath2-rays by the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the _ fermi _ satellite during the first year of operation , although possible association for the lat sources with radio - quiet agns are tentatively proposed in the first lat agn catalog @xcite . as _",

    "these sources are characterized by the presence of a compact radio core , apparent superluminal jet speed , extreme flux density variability in all bands , and high fraction of polarized optical and radio emission .",
    "their observational properties are interpreted as the result of severe beaming effects due to the orientation of the relativistic jet at very small angles to the line of sight . + thanks to the episodes of enhanced luminosity across the entire electromagnetic spectrum , it is possible to set constraints on the physical properties of the region along the jet responsible for the emission at the various wavelengths .",
    "radio monitoring of egret sources suggested that the highest levels of @xmath2-ray emission is observed close in time to radio flares ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and connected with the emission of a new jet component @xcite .",
    "both pieces of evidence give support to the idea that the strongest @xmath2-ray emission is strictly related to a shock in the jet that produces the synchrotron radio flare ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it must be noted that the egret data were sparse , with large uncertainties and selection effects , precluding a clear temporal correlation between @xmath2-ray activity and the emission at lower frequencies .",
    "the advent of the agile and _ fermi _ @xmath2-ray satellites allowed us to test the results obtained in the egret era , providing details on the connection between @xmath2-ray and radio emission to find out the mechanisms responsible for the high - energy emission .",
    "correlation studies of the first three months of _ fermi_-lat data and quasi - simultaneous very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations showed that the gamma - ray emitting blazars have faster apparent jet speeds @xcite , wider apparent opening angles @xcite , and higher variability and doppler factor @xcite , with respect to blazars with weak @xmath2-ray emission .",

    "both the misalignment and the highly superluminal jet speed indicate that the jet axis of pks1510 - 089 forms a very small angle of a few degrees to the line of sight .",

    "the increase in luminosity is first detected at high frequencies , at millimeter wavelengths , subsequently followed at lower frequencies with some delay , consistent with opacity effects .",
    "episodes of enhanced radio luminosity also seem to be related to changes in the pc - scale radio structure where new components are ejected with apparent superluminal velocity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "interestingly , comparing the properties of the knots analysed in this paper with those studied in previous works ( table [ tabella_moto ] ) we found that all the knots are separating from the core with an apparent velocity that ranges between 15@xmath0 and 20@xmath0 , and all the jet components are well aligned along the same position angle , suggesting that no jet precession is taking place on a time lag longer than a decade in our frame . + in fig .",
    "[ 1510_arrow ] , we report the time of zero separation of all the components ejected between 1994 and 2010 , either analysed in this paper , or from the literature .",
    "the ejection of a new component likely occurs roughly once per year .",
    "the gaps between 2000 and 2004 is likely due to sparse observations available , precluding to reliably follow the evolution of the source components in this period . + since 1995 , in addition to the typical variability interchanging low - activity with high - activity states , the source shows on average a slight increase of the total flux density ( fig .",
    "[ 1510_arrow ] ) .",
    "however , the sparse distribution of the data points does not allow us to unambiguously relate the ejection date of the superluminal components , represented by the arrows in fig .",
    "[ 1510_arrow ] , with the various states of the source variability .",
    "+ from the analysis of the parsec - scale resolution data we could construct the lightcurves for the core and jet components separately , and to study a connection between the total intensity and the polarized emission .",
    "the core has high degree of variability , both in the total intensity flux density and in polarization properties , but the data points are too sparse to compare changes in the total intensity and polarized emission throughout the entire time interval . an interesting case is represented by the simultaneous enhancement of the total intensity flux density and the decrease of the fractional polarization observed in the second half of 1999 , and the rotation of evpa around may - july 2001 , with a swing of 85@xmath4 and 130@xmath4 at 8.4 and 15 ghz respectively ( fig .",
    "[ plot_mojave99 ] ) .",
    "possible explanations may be related either to variation in the opacity in a newly ejected self - absorbed component , or to a highly ordered magnetic field produced by the compression of tangled magnetic fields by shocks . in the former scenario",
    "the evolution of the jet knot implies a change between the opacity regimes . as a consequence both the total intensity and the polarized flux densities should decrease during the transition , whereas the magnetic field should jump by 90 degrees .",
    "as the opacity decreases , the total flux density should increase in the optically - thick part of the spectrum , while the polarization percentage decreases . as the emitting region expands becoming optically - thin , the radio emission decreases , while the fractional polarization increases and the magnetic field flips of 90 degrees , going back to its original value .",
    "it must be noted that changes of the evpa of 90@xmath4 are expected from opacity effects during the transition between the two regimes . since the process is quite fast , a dense time sampling of the polarization information ( as the one obtained between 2007 and 2010 , fig .",
    "[ multi_chi ] ) is crucial to detect the transition between the regimes .",
    "a sparser sampling , like the one between 1999 and 2001 ( fig .",
    "[ plot_mojave99 ] ) , may provide evpa changes larger / smaller than the expected 90@xmath4 .",
    "the transition between the optically - thick and -thin regimes occurs in the presence of high opacity values ( e.g. @xmath15 5 - 10 , see for example aller ( 1970 ) and pacholczyk ( 1970 ) for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "such opacity would cause a dramatic drop of the total intensity flux density during the transition .",
    "the lack of observations during the first half of 1999 , i.e. when the new jet component should have originated , do not allow us to unambiguously confirm the opacity scenario . however , the increase of the total flux density observed between 1999 and 2000 is difficult to explain in the presence of such high values of the opacity , making this scenario unlikely .",
    "+ the alternative scenario assumes the formation of a shock that causes the compression of the plasma along the propagation axis .",
    "this generates the amplification of the perpendicular component of the magnetic field with respect to the parallel one , and an enhancement of the luminosity .",
    "this scenario would predict an increase of the fractional polarization instead of the drop observed close to the radio outburst .",
    "however , we must note that if the shock is oblique instead of transverse , the expected variations in the polarization properties are different , and strongly related to the obliqueness of the shock itself , and to the characteristics of the underling magnetic field like its order and strength .",
    "therefore , a reliable interpretation of the observed polarization trends requires a much better sampling than that available between 1998 - 2001 ( fig .",
    "[ plot_mojave99 ] ) , leaving the debate on the nature of the main mechanism at work still open .",
    "+ the analysis of the lightcurves and polarization trends between 1998 and 2001 , shown in fig .",
    "[ plot_mojave99 ] , suggests that the variations of the total intensity flux density and the polarization properties may be explained by both the previous scenarios .",
    "indeed , the total intensity and polarization properties can be related to the evolution ( likely adiabatic expansion ) of either a new jet component or a shock originated at the beginning of 1999 .",
    "support to this interpretation comes from the detection of a superluminal component that possibly originated in 1999.10@xmath10.25 @xcite .",
    "the rotation of the angle found in 2001 may be explained considering that this new component moves far enough from the core to be resolved and the intrinsic polarized emission of the core can be separated from that of the jet . +      the lightcurves considered in the above explanation would require a more frequent sampling and for this reason a definitive interpretation of the physical mechanisms at work is precluded .",
    "a similar consideration may apply to explain the source behaviour around april 2009 , when information at other wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is available .",
    "the multiwavelength lightcurve presented by @xcite shows a flux density enhancement around that period that is first detected at 230 ghz , and after some delay at lower frequencies .",
    "the same behaviour is visible in fig .",
    "[ peak_flux ] where the lightcurves at 15 and 43 ghzglast/1510.html . ] have been compared . from fig .",
    "[ peak_flux ] we see that the flux densities at both frequencies have a similar behaviour , where the 43-ghz data points seem to anticipate those at lower frequency .",
    "interestingly , just after march 2009 , when several @xmath2-ray flares have been detected @xcite , the flux density at 43 ghz becomes higher than that at 15 ghz implying a change in the opacity of the component . the maximum of the radio emission is then reached in april 2009 when another strong @xmath2-ray flare was detected @xcite . in correspondence of this luminosity enhancement",
    "the polarization percentage drops while the evpa changes by about 75@xmath4(fig .",
    "[ multi_chi ] ) at both 15 and 43 ghz becoming parallel to the jet direction . in the same period",
    "a strong rotation of the optical polarization vector @xcite has been detected together with the ejection of a new superluminal component observed at 15 ghz ( fig .",
    "[ fit_mojave ] ) , and already reported by @xcite , and at 43 ghz @xcite .",
    "a similar example of dramatic rotation of the polarization angle and a drop of the fractional polarization in coincidence with a @xmath2-ray flare was found in the blazar 3c279 , indicating a co - spatiality of the optical and @xmath2-ray emission region @xcite .",
    "this has been explained assuming a non - axisymmetric structure of the emitting region , likely a curved jet trajectory , rather than a perpendicular shock moving in an axially symmetric jet as we suggested in section 4.1 . in this case , the degree and angle of polarization strictly depends on the instantaneous angle formed by the direction of the motion with our line of sight @xcite .",
    "the similarity between 3c279 and pks1510 - 089 suggests a common origin also for the emission at high energy and in the radio band , and the time lag in the flux density behaviour may be due to opacity effects as the shock passes by .",
    "a cospatiality of the @xmath2-ray and radio emitting region was also claimed for the bl lac object oj287 , where two @xmath2-ray flaring episodes occurred close in time with two major millimeter outbursts @xcite .",
    "+ in pks1510 - 089 , the variation in the polarization angle at both 15 and 43 ghz suggests a change in the magnetic field orientation in the compact component rather than faraday effects caused by an external screen .",
    "changes in the polarization angle of the same magnitude at different wavelengths were reported by @xcite who monitored the behaviour of a sample of 12 blazars by means of dual - frequency vlba observations . + it is worth noting that , as in the case of 3c279 where no changes in the radio band could be found related to the @xmath2-ray flare @xcite , in pks1510 - 089 no obvious connection between the @xmath2-ray activity detected in march 2009 @xcite and the radio flux density behaviour has been found , suggesting that during this flare the synchrotron radiation in the radio band is not yet fully optically thin .",
    "we have presented results from the analysis of multi - epoch polarimetric vlbi , space - vlbi and archival vlba data from the mojave programme of the flat spectrum radio quasar pks1510 - 089 spanning over 15 years ( 1995 - 2010 ) .",
    "this source shows a pc - scale core - jet structure where superluminal knots are ejected at different times . from the multi - epoch observations we found that the emission of new blobs is roughly constant with a time lag of about one year .",
    "furthermore , the various jet components are moving away from the core with an apparent superluminal speed in the range between 15@xmath0 and 20@xmath0 and roughly with the same position angle , suggesting that the precession of the jet is not relevant on the timescale of decades in our frame .",
    "both the total intensity and the polarized flux density of the core component show high level of variability .",
    "our analysis shows that occasionally the evpa has abrupt changes of about 90 degrees becoming roughly perpendicular to the jet direction during episodes related to enhanced radio emission and opacity variations .",
    "these properties may be explained assuming a change between the optically - thick and optically - thin regime as a consequence of a shock that varies the opacity . in this context , the luminosity locally increases due to the compression of the plasma in the direction of the shock propagation , causing the amplification of the perpendicular component of the magnetic field with respect to the parallel one , and the evpa becomes parallel to the direction of the shock propagation .",
    "the observed properties may also be explained as due to a highly ordered magnetic field produced by either an oblique shock or a transverse one propagating down a jet with a curved trajectory . in this case",
    "the angle of the electric vector and level of polarization strictly depend on the instantaneous angle formed by the direction of the shock with our line of sight , thus explaining changes in the polarization angle different from the 90 degrees expected during the transition between the opacity regimes .",
