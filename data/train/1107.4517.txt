    "<S> we derive exact analytical results for the wave functions and energies of harmonically trapped two - component bose - einstein condensates with weakly repulsive interactions under rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the isospin symmetric wave functions are universal and do not depend on the matrix elements of the two - body interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with the results from numerical diagonalization shows that the ground state and low - lying excitations consists of condensates of @xmath0-wave pairs for repulsive contact interactions , coulomb interactions , and the repulsive interactions between aligned dipoles .    </S>",
    "<S> exact analytical solutions for interacting quantum many - body systems are very rare  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , they are of tremendous interest since they may provide us with further insight into the correlations of quantum - mechanical many - body systems . even rarer are cases where the exactly solvable quantum many - body system can also potentially be realized experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> a famous example is the celebrated laughlin state  @xcite and its generalizations  @xcite that describe the two - dimensional electron gas in the quantum hall regime . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , the advances with ultra - cold atomic quantum gases have significantly broadened the range of experimentally accessible many - body systems that are also solvable exactly . </S>",
    "<S> an example is the interacting bose gas in one dimension . here , the bethe ansatz offers an analytic solution to the lieb - liniger model  @xcite , and </S>",
    "<S> the fermionization of bosons in the tonks - girardeau  @xcite limit has been observed  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> exact analytical solutions exist also for single - component dilute and weakly interacting bose - einstein condensates under rotation  @xcite . for a large class of repulsive two - body interactions , the exact ground state of @xmath1 bosons at angular momentum @xmath2 results from projecting the unique state where @xmath2 particles carry one unit of angular momentum onto the subspace with zero angular momentum for the center of mass  @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we generalize this exact solution to the interesting case of a two - component bose gas  @xcite , and arrive at a very appealing result : as in the single - component case , the exact solutions at angular momentum @xmath2 are states where @xmath2 bosons carry one unit of angular momentum each , and as before one has to project out excitations of the center of mass . in the two - component case , however , isospin enters as a good quantum number , and eigenstates can be labeled by the number of isospin - singlet @xmath0-wave pairs that enter the wave function . </S>",
    "<S> isospin was introduced in nuclear physics by heisenberg  @xcite and  like ordinary spin  is based on su(2 ) symmetry of two - component systems . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with numerical results shows that for repulsive contact interactions , coulomb forces , and repulsive forces between aligned dipoles  @xcite , the ground state contains a maximum number of isospin - singlet @xmath0-wave pairs . </S>",
    "<S> this letter also explains the recent study by bargi _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , who found by numerical diagonalization that the yrast energy of two - component bose gases is a simple function of angular momentum .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a harmonically trapped two - component dilute gas of @xmath1 bosons of a first species @xmath3 , and @xmath4 bosons of a second species @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the interactions are perturbatively weak and of equal strength between intra - species and inter - species . </S>",
    "<S> this special case of equal scattering lengths is approximately realized in gases of @xmath6rb and gases of @xmath7na  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us list the conserved quantities involved in this problem . </S>",
    "<S> besides the isospin @xmath8 , the total angular momentum @xmath2 , the angular momentum of the center of mass @xmath9 , the total number of bosons @xmath10 and the isospin projection @xmath11 are conserved . </S>",
    "<S> there is no simple basis that reflects these symmetries simultaneously . in second quantization </S>",
    "<S> the conservation of @xmath2 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath8 is straight forward , while the conservation of @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and @xmath9 is most easily expressed in the configuration space within first quantization . </S>",
    "<S> we will employ both pictures in what follows .    </S>",
    "<S> single - particle states @xmath14 of the spherical harmonic oscillator have energies @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in low - energetic states at high angular momentum . for weakly perturbative interactions , only single - particle states with no radial excitation ( @xmath16 ) can contribute , and we can limit ourselves to maximally aligned states with @xmath17 . thus , single - particle states with single - particle angular momentum @xmath18 are @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the bosons of the species @xmath3 and @xmath5 , respectively . we denote the coordinates of bosons belonging to the @xmath3 species by @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and and by @xmath23 , ( @xmath24 ) for the @xmath5 species . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) are the two cartesian coordinates perpendicular to the axis of rotation for the @xmath3 ( @xmath5 ) species . in what follows , </S>",
    "<S> we omit the ubiquitous gaussians from the single - particle wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath29 and @xmath30 create a boson in the state corresponding to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding annihilation operators are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and the creation and annihilation operators fulfill the canonical commutation relations for bosons .    in the case of a single species of bosons under rotation , </S>",
    "<S> the ground state at angular momentum @xmath2 consists essentially of @xmath2 bosons carrying one unit of angular momentum each while the remaining @xmath35 bosons carry no angular momentum  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> small modifications of this picture are due to the preservation of the angular momentum of the center of mass . remarkably , the two - component case is somewhat similar , and bargi _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite numerically found that the ground state consists entirely of single - particle states with angular momenta @xmath36 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath38 , there are @xmath39 such states ( labeled by the number of bosons of the species @xmath3 that are in the single - particle state with @xmath37 ) . what is the ground state for repulsive interactions in the space spanned by these states ? to address this question for a two - component system , we recall the essence of hund s rule : for repulsive interactions </S>",
    "<S> , the interaction energy is minimized for wave functions that are antisymmetric in position space . in fermionic electron systems such as atoms and quantum dots , </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a symmetric spin wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the same reasoning applied to the present case of a two - species bose gas would require the isospin wave function to be antisymmetric , too , thus making the total wave function symmetric under particle exchange . </S>",
    "<S> the operator ^(^_1 ^_0 - ^_0^_1 ) creates an isospin - singlet @xmath0-wave pair ( i.e. @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this pair is antisymmetric in position space and antisymmetric in isospin space and thus totally symmetric under exchange . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the interaction energy is minimized for condensates of isospin - singlet pairs . in general , we have @xmath42 , and the ground - state wave function will also consist of unpaired bosons . the states [ hi ] |_(_-)^n-(^_0)^a - l- ( ^_1)^l- ( ^)^|0 have angular momentum @xmath2 , isospin @xmath43 , isospin projection @xmath11 , and consist entirely of single - particle states with angular momenta @xmath36 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath44 denotes the vacuum , and @xmath45 is the number of isospin - singlet pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the isospin operators are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are denotes as @xmath13 and @xmath51 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> let us understand the state  ( [ hi ] ) in detail starting from the right . </S>",
    "<S> the application of the pair operators @xmath52 to the vacuum yields a state of @xmath53 bosons with quantum numbers @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the operators @xmath55 yields the angular momentum @xmath2 we seek , increase the number of bosons to @xmath56 , while keeping isospin @xmath57 a good quantum number . </S>",
    "<S> the application of the operators @xmath58 increase the number of bosons to @xmath12 and keeps isospin a good quantum number . finally , the desired particle numbers @xmath4 and @xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath59 results from the @xmath60 operators . for repulsive interactions </S>",
    "<S> the ground state consists of the maximum number of isospin - singlet pairs ( i.e. @xmath61 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the observation by bargi _ et al . _ , </S>",
    "<S> together with an adaptation of hund s rule for bosons and isospin symmetry leads to eigenstates  ( [ hi ] ) consisting of condensates of isospin - singlet @xmath0-wave pairs . </S>",
    "<S> note that these arguments are independent of the details of the repulsive interaction . </S>",
    "<S> these are the main result of the present letter . as in the single - component case , minor modifications of this picture are due to the conserved angular momentum of the center of mass . </S>",
    "<S> let us contrast our results to bcs pairing in fermi systems . </S>",
    "<S> in bcs theory , a weakly attractive interaction leads to the formation of cooper pairs ( i.e. pairs of fermions in time - reversed orbits ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting bcs ground state is a condensate of spin - singlet @xmath62-wave pairs , where the symmetric configuration - space wave function optimizes the interaction energy . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , we deal with bosons and with repulsive interactions , and this modifies the picture accordingly .    </S>",
    "<S> let us compute the energies of the states  ( [ hi ] ) . </S>",
