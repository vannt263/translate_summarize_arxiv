    "this paper will be concerned with the modified nonlinear schrdinger ( mnls ) equation for a complex - valued function @xmath0 : @xmath1 the correct problem to pose for this equation when @xmath2 is the cauchy problem , where initial data @xmath3 are given at @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are real parameters which we assume throughout the paper satisfy the inequalities given in .",
    "the focusing nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation is a special case of when @xmath7 .",
    "the focusing nls equation is of course very well known , arising naturally in the modeling of any nearly monochromatic , weakly nonlinear , dispersive wave propagation . in particular , it is in many circumstances an adequate model to describe the evolution of the electric field envelope of picosecond pulses in monomode optical fibers @xcite .",
    "the so - called `` semiclassical '' or zero - dispersion limit of the focusing nls cauchy problem consists of taking the initial condition in the form @xmath8 for fixed real functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 and considering the behavior of the corresponding solution @xmath0 of the focusing nls equation in the limit @xmath11 .",
    "this asymptotic problem is important in the design of increasingly prevalent dispersion - shifted fibers as well as being of intrinsic mathematical interest .",
    "the utility of the focusing nls equation as a mathematical model stems from the fact that this equation is integrable , and in principal the cauchy problem may be solved using the scattering / inverse scattering transform @xcite that is precisely adapted to this equation . however , in applications if higher - order effects become important then it is necessary to account for them in the model . to consider sub - picosecond electromagnetic pulses in monomode optical fibers , one should consider the more general evolution equation , @xmath12 where @xmath5 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are real constants and where the three additional terms on the right hand side account for nonlinear dispersion , intrapulse raman scattering , and higher - order linear dispersion respectively @xcite . in general , ( [ mnlsgen ] ) is not integrable ; however it turns out that there are special cases of besides @xmath15 that are integrable , although by different machinery than applies to the focusing nls equation .",
    "in fact , the mnls equation is such an integrable system @xcite ( related to the so - called `` derivative '' nls equation ) .",
    "as the mnls equation takes into account at least the higher - order effect of nonlinear dispersion , understanding the predictions of this equation can serve as a mathematical `` stepping stone '' in the understanding of the more general problem as well as any weakly nonlinear , nearly monochromatic , dispersive wave propagation problem when nonlinear dispersion is not negligible .",
    "one of the well - known features of the focusing nls equation is the so - called _",
    "modulational instability_. this instability may be manifested in several different ways , and so the term `` modulational instability '' can mean different things in different contexts . however , the simplest context of modulational instability is the linearized perturbation theory of small disturbances of exact `` plane - wave '' solutions of the focusing nls equation .",
    "indeed , the nls equation @xmath16 ( the focusing case is @xmath17 and the defocusing case is @xmath18 ) has exact solutions ( plane waves ) of the form @xmath19 for real constants @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 necessarily related by the _ nonlinear dispersion relation _ @xmath23 consider a small perturbation of this plane - wave solution by substituting @xmath24 into , where @xmath25 is a new unknown . in this way , one obtains an ( equivalent ) equation for the `` in - phase '' perturbation @xmath25 : latexmath:[\\[i{\\varepsilon}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t } + ik{\\varepsilon}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x } + \\frac{{\\varepsilon}^2}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2p}{\\partial x^2}+ \\kappa a^2(p+p^*+2|p|^2+p^2 +    @xmath25 to be small , this equation may be linearized and written as a system for @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath29 this is a linear constant - coefficient system of partial differential equations that may be solved using fourier techniques .",
    "we look for elementary solutions of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a `` relative wavenumber '' ( to @xmath21 ) , which reduces to a system of ordinary differential equations : @xmath32 there is a basis of solutions proportional to eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix on the right - hand side , and the time dependence enters through factors of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the corresponding eigenvalue of the coefficient matrix .",
    "the eigenvalues are given by @xmath35 if we are in the defocusing case ( @xmath18 ) then @xmath34 is always purely imaginary , and all fourier - type solutions of are oscillatory in @xmath36 .",
    "this behavior indicates the _ absence _ of modulational instability in the defocusing case .",
    "however , if we are in the focusing case ( @xmath17 ) then @xmath34 has a nonzero real part if @xmath37 and therefore there is a band of unstable relative wavenumbers about @xmath38 ( and hence a _ sideband _ of the unperturbed wavenumber @xmath21 ) .",
    "this is the modulational instability in its simplest form .",
    "these calculations show that in the focusing case , the only perturbations that have a chance of avoiding growth correspond to waves of length @xmath39 , and worse yet , the exponential growth rates for the unstable modes scale as @xmath40 . in this sense ,",
    "the modulational instability is enhanced when @xmath6 is small .",
    "the modulational instability may also be understood from a nonlinear perspective , via the so - called _",
    "modulation equations_. without loss of generality , we write the solution @xmath0 of in the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a real amplitude and @xmath43 is a real phase , and then implies corresponding ( real ) nonlinear equations governing these two functions .",
    "if we think of @xmath44 and @xmath43 as functions independent of @xmath6 ( this assumption is of course not exactly consistent with ) then locally in the neighborhood of fixed @xmath45 and @xmath36 , @xmath0 resembles a plane wave solution with amplitude @xmath46 , wavenumber @xmath47 , and frequency @xmath48 .",
    "this observation is the grounds for expecting a connection between the preceding perturbative calculation and what will now follow . to proceed ,",
    "it is more natural to introduce @xmath49 and @xmath50 and obtain equations for these unknowns equivalent to : @xmath51 this time , the approximation we make ( in lieu of the formal linearization step in the preceding discussion ) is to drop the formally small terms in @xmath6 .",
    "thus , one arrives at the modulation equations associated to ( [ nls ] ) , @xmath52    a system of quasilinear partial differential equations of the form is called _ hyperbolic _ if the coefficient matrix of the @xmath45-derivatives has distinct real eigenvalues and _ elliptic _ if the eigenvalues are complex .",
    "cauchy problems for hyperbolic systems can be solved by the method of characteristics , one implication of which is continuous dependence of the solution on initial data for small time .",
    "the hyperbolic cauchy problem is said to be _ well - posed_. on the other hand , the cauchy problem is ill - posed for elliptic systems .",
    "worse yet , the cauchy problem for an elliptic system can only be solved at all ( by the method of cauchy - kovalevskaya ) if the initial data @xmath53 and @xmath54 are analytic functions of the variable @xmath45 ; this should be regarded as a overly restrictive condition for a physically relevant mathematical model .",
    "it is easy to check that for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the system is elliptic for @xmath17 and hyperbolic for @xmath18 .",
    "this calculation therefore reveals the same dichotomy between the focusing and defocusing versions of the nls equation as did linearization about a plane wave .",
    "the linearization calculation may be viewed as a `` local in @xmath45 '' version of the deduction of type ( hyperbolic or elliptic ) of modulation equations . in general , hyperbolicity of plane - wave modulation equations",
    "is equivalent to the absence of linear instabilities of plane waves of sideband type , although it is possible for a system to have hyperbolic modulation equations while admitting instabilities of relatively short waves @xcite .",
    "interestingly , analyticity of initial data as required by elliptic modulation equations plays a fundamental role in the spectral and inverse - spectral analysis of the focusing nls equation in the semiclassical limit @xcite , even though the latter analysis is not based on modulation equations at all .",
    "( for an approach based directly on the cauchy - kovalevskaya series solution of the analytic data cauchy problem for the elliptic modulation equations , see grard @xcite . )",
    "one might notice that in the linearization calculation the conclusion of stability or instability was independent of the pair @xmath57 that characterizes the underlying plane wave .",
    "indeed , in the focusing case , there is a band of unstable relative wavenumbers no matter what values @xmath21 and @xmath58 take .",
    "similarly , the modulation equations are elliptic or hyperbolic independently of @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in principle , it could have been otherwise ; some waves may be stable to all sideband perturbations while others are not .",
    "for such a system , the modulation equations may be hyperbolic for some values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 and elliptic for others , and the system is said to admit a _ change of type_. it will turn out that the system of modulation equations for the mnls equation admits a change of type .    to summarize , the focusing nls equation exhibits modulational instability , while the defocusing nls equation is modulationally stable .",
    "now , the mnls equation appears to be a perturbation of the focusing nls equation ( through the limit @xmath61 ) .",
    "one might expect on these grounds that the mnls problem should also experience modulational instability .",
    "on the other hand , consider making the following substitution in : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "then , by direct calculation , @xmath66 satisfies @xmath67",
    "if @xmath7 , we recover the well - known result that the focusing nls equation is invariant under the one - parameter group of galilean transformations .",
    "more generally , the mnls equation is certainly not invariant under this group . in particular",
    ", one may note that by choosing @xmath68 so that @xmath69 , the sign of the @xmath70 term becomes negative is chosen so that @xmath71 exactly , then under the galilean boost the mnls equation for @xmath72 reduces to the so - called derivative nls equation for @xmath66 . ] , and thus the equation governing @xmath73 takes the form of a perturbed _ defocusing _ nls equation rather then a perturbation of the _ focusing _ nls equation .    given that when @xmath7 one expects drastically different behavior in the semiclassical limit depending on whether the sign of the cubic term is positive ( strong modulational instability ) or negative ( modulational stability ) , the above calculation suggests two things : ( i ) the term in the mnls equation proportional to @xmath5 certainly does not constitute a small perturbation uniformly in the phase space of fields @xmath72 ( that is , taking @xmath74 amounts to a singular perturbation of the nls equation ) , and ( ii ) that part of the phase space of fields @xmath72 may evolve under the mnls equation in such a way as to _ avoid all catastrophic modulational instability _ associated with the undifferentiated cubic term @xmath75 . if this latter statement can be placed on rigorous footing",
    ", there are immediate implications for the design of optical fiber telecommunication links ( for example ) .",
    "indeed , one of the difficulties arising in long - distance fiber - optic systems is the so - called gordon - haus effect , in which pulses experience a random `` jitter '' in their arrival times which leads to detection errors .",
    "this effect has been shown to be a consequence of the modulational instability associated with the focusing nonlinearity ( and anomalous dispersion ) in the focusing nls model .",
    "the possibility of avoiding gordon - haus jitter in the context of the mnls model has already been explored @xcite at the level of single soliton solutions .",
    "one of our goals is to understand this change in stability for the mnls equation at the level of more general initial data , and in particular initial data that `` contain '' many solitons as is characteristic of the semiclassical scaling .    due to its integrable structure ,",
    "solving the cauchy problem for the mnls equation requires three steps :    * * step 1 . *",
    "calculate certain `` spectral data '' associated with the given initial condition for the problem , viewed here as a coefficient in a linear system of differential equations with a spectral parameter .",
    "this is a `` forward transform '' of the initial data .",
    "* * step 2 . *",
    "determine how the spectral data change as the field @xmath72 evolves under the mnls equation , and obtain the spectral data corresponding to the evolved field .",
    "* * step 3 . *",
    "find the field @xmath0 from the time - evolved spectral data , that is , invert the mapping from step 1 .",
    "this is an `` inverse transform '' step that in many cases can be written as a matrix - valued riemann - hilbert problem from analytic function theory .",
    "the miracle of integrability is that for an appropriate linear system of differential equations with spectral parameter , the inverse of the spectral map of step 1 that is required in step 3 actually exists , and as importantly the evolution of the spectral data in step 2 is completely explicit . for semiclassical problems ,",
    "the small parameter @xmath6 enters significantly in the first and third steps .",
    "therefore , to understand the stability transition in the mnls equation and its role in semiclassical asymptotics , we must first understand the forward transform ( step 1 ) in the semiclassical regime .",
    "once the the semiclassical asymptotics of the forward transform have been understood , it will remain to utilize the growing library of tools of asymptotic analysis for riemann - hilbert problems to complete the solution of the cauchy problem for the mnls equation in the limit @xmath76 . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the spectral problem associated with the mnls equation ( see ) paying particular attention to results that are meaningful in the limit @xmath76 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : modeqns ] we follow the procedure applicable to the nls equation to obtain the modulation equations associated to the mnls equation . through the analysis of these modulation equations",
    "we will obtain a condition for modulational stability . throughout the remainder of the paper we note the importance of this condition and the role it plays in the spectral problem . in section",
    "[ sec : hyperbolae ] we establish some bounds on the discrete eigenvalues of the spectral problem associated to the mnls equation . in section [ sec : hypergeometric ] we use the theory of special functions to calculate the spectral data explicitly for a certain multiparameter family of initial conditions ; this calculation is valid for all @xmath77 and provides an explicit avenue to the semiclassical analysis of the corresponding cauchy problem .",
    "the appendix contains the general spectral and inverse - spectral theory associated with the mnls equation ( that is , all theoretical details of steps 13 above ) and in particular includes a derivation of the associated riemann - hilbert problem that we will return to in a later publication .",
    "the theory outlined in the appendix frames all of our analysis of the mnls equation .      throughout the paper ,",
    "we use boldface capital letters to refer to square matrices , with the exception of the identity matrix which we write as @xmath78 , the pauli matrices @xmath79 and certain diagonal matrices denoted @xmath80 for @xmath81 and defined by @xmath82 lowercase boldface letters refer to column vectors .",
    "we use the `` dagger '' notation ( superscript @xmath83 ) to indicate the transpose and elementwise complex conjugate of a matrix or vector , and we use asterisk notation ( superscript @xmath84 ) for complex conjugation .",
    "we sometimes use prime notation for derivatives of functions of just one variable .",
    "in this section we derive the modulation equations associated to the mnls equation and find a condition on the local amplitude and wavenumber equivalent to the hyperbolicity of these equations . by analogy with the connection between hyperbolicity of modulation equations and stability of plane",
    "waves described in the context of the nls equation in section [ sec : intro ] , this calculation gives a condition under which the mnls equation is ( locally ) modulationally stable .",
    "the fact that one can have local stability without global stability is related to the fact the mnls modulation equations admit change of type .",
    "consider the mnls equation , and for some real - valued functions @xmath44 and @xmath43 write the solution @xmath0 as : @xmath85 substitution into ( [ mnlscauchy ] ) , canceling the phase factor @xmath86 , taking the imaginary part , multiplying by @xmath58 and dividing by @xmath6 gives : @xmath87 proceeding similarly but taking the real part instead , one arrives at : @xmath88 setting @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the system of _ modulation equations _ is obtained by dropping the formally small terms in @xmath6 : @xmath91      the eigenvalues @xmath92 of the coefficient matrix of the @xmath45-derivatives in are the roots of the equation : @xmath93 the discriminant of this equation is @xmath94 . since @xmath56 ,",
    "the condition @xmath95 is equivalent to having real distinct eigenvalues , which makes a hyperbolic system . note that for a given value of the parameter @xmath96 , this condition involves both dependent variables @xmath60 ( square of local plane - wave amplitude ) and @xmath59 ( local wavenumber ) and this dependence is characteristic of a quasilinear system that can change type .",
    "the inequality will appear at every stage of our analysis of the spectral problem ( see ) associated with the mnls equation .",
    "while this paper is concerned mostly with the semiclassical limit of the spectral transform associated with the mnls equation and a subsequent paper will analyze the corresponding inverse - spectral transform in this limit , it is worthwhile pointing out how we might expect the stability criterion to influence the inverse - spectral part of the solution of the mnls cauchy problem for rapidly decaying initial data of the form @xmath8 , @xmath2 .",
    "how do modulated plane waves emerge from the asymptotic analysis of the inverse - spectral problem ? as shown in the appendix , the inverse - spectral problem for the mnls cauchy problem can be cast as a riemann - hilbert problem in which one seeks a @xmath97 matrix - valued unknown depending principally upon a complex variable @xmath21 and parametrically upon @xmath45 , @xmath36 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the unknown matrix is characterized by a normalization condition as @xmath98 , prescribed discontinuities along the real and imaginary @xmath21-axes , simple poles with prescribed residues at certain other points in the complex @xmath21-plane , and analyticity in @xmath21 for all other @xmath99 .",
    "such a riemann - hilbert problem involving a parameter @xmath6 in a singular way may be analyzed by a two - step process .",
    "first , one introduces an explicit transformation of the matrix - valued unknown designed to remove the poles at the expense of introducing new jump discontinuities .",
    "thus one arrives at an equivalent riemann - hilbert problem for a piecewise - analytic matrix - valued function of @xmath21 whose jump discontinuities lie along a system , @xmath100 , of contours including ( generally ) the real and imaginary @xmath21-axes .",
    "second , one introduces a so - called @xmath101-function ( an innovation discovered in @xcite ) , a scalar function of @xmath21 analytic for @xmath102 , and by multiplying the matrix - valued unknown on the right by the diagonal matrix @xmath103 one arrives at a second equivalent riemann - hilbert problem on the same system @xmath100 of contours but for which the jump conditions involve the boundary values of @xmath101 .",
    "the function @xmath101 is then chosen to cast the jump conditions for the matrix unknown in as simple a form as possible . by the phrase `` as simple a form as possible , ''",
    "we really mean that @xmath101 is chosen so that the steepest descent method of deift and zhou @xcite applies , implying a set of conditions that one expects to uniquely determine @xmath101 .",
    "a matrix - valued riemann - hilbert problem to which the steepest descent method applies is one for which the ratio of the boundary values of the unknown is a matrix taking two alternate forms in complementary systems of subintervals of @xmath100 .",
    "the number of subintervals and their common endpoints depend on the remaining parameters of the problem , including @xmath45 and @xmath36 .",
    "the common endpoints @xmath104 of these subintervals have special significance as branching points of the lax eigenfunctions ( solutions @xmath105 of the linear equation ; see the appendix ) corresponding to the local asymptotic solution of the mnls equation in a small neighborhood of @xmath106 .",
    "if there are just four of these endpoints , then one expects the local solution to have plane - wave form @xmath107 , where one may consider @xmath108 and @xmath109 to be _",
    "constants_. to understand the interpretation of the branching points @xmath110 in terms of @xmath60 and @xmath59 , note that the relevant scattering problem ( see below ) is written in terms of @xmath60 and @xmath59 as @xmath111 with @xmath60 and @xmath59 constant , this is a constant - coefficient linear problem with eigensolutions @xmath112 , where @xmath113 the eigenvalues are @xmath114 and branching points of the eigenfunctions in the complex @xmath21-plane will occur where @xmath115 or equivalently where @xmath116 .",
    "there are therefore at most four branching points satisfying @xmath117    it follows that if ( i ) steepest descent analysis of the inverse - spectral riemann - hilbert problem in the limit @xmath76 leads to a solution of the mnls equation of the form @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 , and ( ii ) the plane wave characterized by @xmath60 and @xmath59 is modulationally stable according to the hyperbolicity criterion , then it is necessary that the @xmath101-function of steepest descent theory provides four endpoints @xmath121 all lying on the imaginary axis . on the other hand , if @xmath60 and @xmath59 characterize a modulationally unstable plane wave , then the four endpoints @xmath121 will need to form a quartet invariant under the reflections @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the unstable case of course requires that the contour system , @xmath100 , contain components that are disjoint from the real and imaginary @xmath21-axes , and determining the correct boundary values of the function @xmath101 on such a contour further requires comparing with certain spectral functions computed on the real and imaginary @xmath21-axes ( see the appendix ) that are analytically continued to the complex @xmath21-plane .",
    "this process of analytic continuation , that we expect to only be required in the unstable case , is the spectral analogue of analytic continuation of the functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 to the complex @xmath45-plane as would be necessary to solve the cauchy initial - value problem for the elliptic modulation equations .        with the dependent variable @xmath124 used instead of @xmath59 , the system takes the form @xmath125 that is ,",
    "may be written as a system of local conservation laws for densities @xmath60 and @xmath126 .",
    "strictly speaking , the system is already in this form : @xmath127 however since @xmath109 , the local conservation law for @xmath59 is trivial .",
    "consequently one should seek a second conserved local density that is not a derivative with respect to @xmath45 of a local expression in @xmath58 and @xmath128 .",
    "it is well - known and easy to verify that the _ momentum _",
    "@xmath129 is a nontrivial conserved local density for the modulation equations associated to the focusing nls equation , and the nontrivial conserved local density @xmath126 for ( or equivalently , ) is clearly an @xmath5-perturbation of the momentum .    in the paper",
    "@xcite the quantity @xmath126 is called a _ noncanonical momentum_.",
    "the authors of that paper give an analysis of the ( equivalent , by a galilean boost with speed @xmath130 ) derivative nls equation in the semiclassical limit .",
    "in the spirit of the paper of grenier @xcite , the authors use the system ( with @xmath59 replaced by @xmath131 as is appropriate for the derivative nls equation rather than the mnls equation ) to model the behavior of @xmath132 before singularities form in the solution of the limiting system .",
    "the development in the paper @xcite appears to assume , however , that the system of conservation laws is hyperbolic for arbitrary initial data , and we have seen ( see which becomes simply @xmath133 when @xmath59 is replaced by @xmath131 ) that this is not the case .",

    ".    diagonal form made possible by the introduction of riemann invariants is useful for many purposes .",

    "a final advantage of diagonal form that is useful in considering solutions more general than simple waves is that as long as a solution remains classical it is bounded in terms of its initial data by sharp inequalities of the form @xmath209 in other words , the smallest coordinate box containing the solution at a given @xmath210 is in fact independent of @xmath36 .    perhaps with the help of riemann invariants , the mapping @xmath179 and its double - valued inverse @xmath211",

    "as parabolic curves of the form @xmath193 for @xmath217 are coordinate curves of the riemann invariants for , the evolution in time prior to shock formation will not alter this basic picture due to the inequalities .",

    "therefore , in this situation the single - pulse initial data for the mnls modulation equations is mapped by @xmath179 to triple - pulse initial data for the defocusing nls modulation equations , as shown in figure  [ fig : multihump3 ] .     for @xmath234 and @xmath235 with @xmath244 .",
    "_ _ ]    since the coordinate curves correspond to constant values of one or the other of the riemann invariants , the dynamics of all of these initial conditions under the defocusing nls modulation equations will be given by simple waves .",
    "it follows that the evolution is governed by the scalar inviscid burgers equation , and it may thus be shown that the number of shocks that can form corresponds to the number of critical points of the simple - wave initial data . thus , simply by varying the amplitude of a single - peaked pulse - like initial condition for the mnls modulation equations , one can produce dynamics that lead to either one , two , or three ( dispersively regularized ) shocks .",
    "a relation similar to the equivalence between the mnls modulation equations and those for the focusing or defocusing nls equations has been observed by kuvshinov and lakhin @xcite .",
    "working with the equivalent derivative nls equation , kuvshinov and lakhin derive the modulation equations ( whitham equations ) corresponding not to complex exponential plane waves ( genus zero ) but rather to periodic waves given by elliptic functions ( genus one ) . by comparing the riemann invariants for these whitham equations with the corresponding well - known formulae for the nls genus one whitham equations",
    "they deduce complete equivalence between these two systems of modulation equations .",
    "no doubt this phenomenon extends to genera greater than one , and a deeper explanation of these coincidences surely exists at the level of the algebro - geometric description of arbitrary genus multiphase wave solutions of the nls and derivative nls equations .",
    "we will treat this problem in this framework in a future publication .",
    "in this section we establish some basic conditions on the discrete spectrum associated to the spectral problem for the mnls equation .",
    "as seen in the appendix , for each @xmath21 with @xmath245 there are two one - dimensional subspaces of solutions that decay to zero as @xmath220 respectively .",
    "we refer to _ eigenvalues _ as values of @xmath21 for which these two subspaces coincide and _ eigenfunctions _ as the corresponding solutions @xmath246 of associated to each eigenvalue that decay to zero in both directions appears nonlinearly in the system .",

    "the integrabililty of the mnls equation leads to the fact that eigenvalues do not vary in time ( see ) .",

    "note that although lee s analysis @xcite of the same cauchy problem using inverse - scattering techniques avoids entirely any assumptions about the size of the @xmath386-norm , it excludes nongeneric data leading to spectral singularities and hence is not inconsistent with the hayashi - ozawa conjecture . ]",

    "all of these results apply equally well to the modified nls equation by a galilean change of coordinates followed by a rescaling of @xmath45 and @xmath36 by @xmath6 .",
    "it must be said , however , that these results are unsatisfactory from the point of view of the semiclassical ( @xmath76 ) limit for the cauchy problem for with @xmath8 , because when @xmath58 and @xmath128 are fixed the @xmath386 norm on the left - hand side of becomes , after rescaling of @xmath45 by @xmath6 , proportional to @xmath40 which appears to rule out global solutions . on the other hand , upon rescaling of @xmath36 by @xmath6 , the fixed lifetime of a solution guaranteed by pipolo",
    "s result becomes arbitrarily small in the limit @xmath76 .",
    "so it seems that there are no results in the literature guaranteeing the existence of a unique solution to the cauchy problem for the mnls equation with initial data of the form @xmath8 in the vicinity of fixed @xmath45 and @xmath992 when @xmath6 is sufficiently small .",
    "therefore , to deal with semiclassical problems we are forced to take the approach of defining the solution of the cauchy problem by the riemann - hilbert problem . generally speaking , establishing",
    "the existence of solutions for the riemann - hilbert problem is itself a difficult problem requiring careful analysis and the correct conditions on the function @xmath980 .",
    "see @xcite or @xcite for more details about the corresponding problem in a simpler situation , and @xcite for information relevant to the equivalent derivative nls problem .",
    "however , when one is considering semiclassical asymptotics the problem becomes somewhat simpler because there is the possibility of the systematic construction of an explicit parametrix by means of which the riemann - hilbert problem is reduced to a `` small - norm '' problem that can be solved uniquely by iteration .",
    "this is the essence of the steepest descent method of deift and zhou .",

    "we intend to carry out such a steepest descent analysis for the riemann - hilbert problem corresponding to the mnls equation in a subsequent work .",
    "we may have confidence in the success of such a program also because certain convergence results for the semiclassical mnls equation ( or more correctly the derivative nls equation ) have been obtained by desjardins , lin , and tso using `` nonintegrable '' methods @xcite these authors do not treat the modulationally unstable case . ] . as the effective solution",
    "size and lifetime are both large in this situation , these results suggest that global solutions indeed may typically exist for large data .",
    "however , the approach of @xcite fails when the solutions of the associated modulation equations become nonclassical , and it is exactly at such junctures that the integrable theory typically yields its best results , explaining and giving strong approximations for the wild oscillations that are introduced by dispersive regularization .",
    "it turns out that our riemann - hilbert problem for @xmath946 has `` too much symmetry '' . as we will see below ,",
    "there is a relation between @xmath946 and @xmath993 that will , in the course of semiclassical analysis by the steepest descent method , lead to riemann surfaces with too many branch points . for example , in section [ sec : stabilityrhp ] it was shown that the solutions of the spectral problem corresponding to complex exponential plane - wave solutions of the mnls equation naturally live on a hyperelliptic curve that is two - sheeted covering of the complex @xmath21-plane with four distinct square - root type branch points .",
    "this surface has genus one , and functions on such a riemann surface are constructed from riemann theta functions of genus one ( that is , elliptic functions ) .",
    "one would therefore expect that the potential @xmath72 would itself be constructed from elliptic functions , which appears to contradict our starting point : that @xmath72 was of the simple form @xmath994 .",
    "in this situation , judicious use of factorization identities of riemann theta functions may be required to see that the `` true genus '' is smaller than first thought . to avoid these difficulties",
    "it is desirable to formulate a new riemann - hilbert problem that effectively quotients out the extra symmetry .",
    "this approach was also used by deift , venakides , and zhou @xcite in their analysis of the korteweg - de vries equation , and the specific reduction we use here can be inferred also from the paper of kaup and newell @xcite on the inverse - scattering transform for the derivative nls equation .",
    "it was pointed out earlier that the jost functions enjoy a holomorphic symmetry ; see .",
    "this symmetry , taken together with the implied relation and used in the definition shows that for each @xmath36 the solution @xmath946 of the riemann - hilbert problem ( assuming existence and uniqueness for the moment ) has the property that @xmath995 it follows that the matrix @xmath996 defined by @xmath997 is well - defined as a function of @xmath689 for @xmath402 . from the properties defining @xmath946",
    "we may then deduce a riemann - hilbert problem solved by the first row of @xmath996 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath996 is analytic for @xmath402 , and that the boundary values taken for @xmath687 are continuous at least for @xmath998 . to analyze the behavior near @xmath999",
    ", we see immediately from the normalization condition on @xmath946 that @xmath1000 the statement that @xmath1001 as @xmath1002 alone is not enough to determine the limiting value of @xmath1003 ; however using the integral equations for @xmath1004 it is possible to show that @xmath1005 this limit can not be used to define a normalization condition in the usual way because it has a different value in different half - planes for @xmath401 , and more crucially , it depends on the ( unknown ) potential @xmath0 .",
    "this is the reason why we will only seek to determine the first row of @xmath996 as the solution of a riemann - hilbert problem ( a similar situation occurs in @xcite ) .",
    "being able to find only the first row of @xmath996 is not an obstruction to determining the potential however , since from the reconstruction formula together with the antiholomorphic symmetry relations and we may equally well find @xmath0 from the limit @xmath1006    next , we calculate the jump conditions satisfied by @xmath996 on the real @xmath401-axis .",
    "this is straightforward , and the consistency of the calculation ( two values of @xmath21 with @xmath486 correspond to each @xmath687 ) depends on the symmetry relations which imply that @xmath1007 is actually a function of @xmath689 that is bounded as @xmath1008 . defining the boundary values by @xmath1009 and noting that in terms of @xmath689 we have @xmath1010 one finds that @xmath1011 therefore , defining @xmath1012 ( this is indeed well - defined because @xmath980 is an odd function of @xmath21 ) we resolve the dichotomy of signs in and find simply @xmath1013",
    "finally , we examine the singularities of @xmath996 . near a pole @xmath746 of @xmath946 with @xmath896 we know from that @xmath1014 for some scalar functions @xmath1015 and",

    "we are now in a position to formulate a `` less symmetric '' riemann - hilbert problem to determine @xmath0 . given @xmath638 for @xmath687 and a set of points @xmath1024 in the upper half - plane along with a corresponding set of nonzero complex numbers @xmath1025 , seek a two - component row vector @xmath1026 $ ] with the following properties    * * analyticity : * the row vector @xmath1027 is an analytic function of @xmath401 for @xmath1028 that takes continuous boundary values on the real line and is uniformly bounded as @xmath1029 .",
