    "since the launch of soho and trace , low - amplitude quasi - periodic disturbances have been found at loop foot points ( _ e.g. _ for a review ) .",
    "the first observations of propagating disturbances ( pds ) were found along coronal plumes by using soho / uvcs , and again by using soho / eit .",
    "these were observed as intensity perturbations travelling at approximately the local sound speed .",
    "this led to their classification as slow magneto - acoustic waves ( see reviews by and ) . propagating disturbances of a similar nature ( in active region loops ) were observed by using soho / eit .",

    "these perturbations usually have small amplitudes of the order of a few percent of the background .",
    "they were found to have velocities of approximately 100 km@xmath0 and periods of two  ten minutes @xcite",
    ". there has also been substantial work done in theoretical modelling of these disturbances @xcite .",
    "these authors have looked at a variety of aspects under the assumption that these disturbances are slow magneto - acoustic waves and found that the observed amplitude decay could be explained in terms of thermal conduction .",
    "the quasi - periodic nature of these waves has been attributed to the leakage of _",

    "they suggested that this agrees with the interpretation of the disturbances as slow magneto - acoustic waves .",
    "although this interpretation was widely accepted for several years , in the last few years it has been questioned again , as spectroscopic observations from _",
    "hinode_/eis have shown the situation is not so straightforward .",
    "these observations still show quasi - periodic intensity perturbations which are correlated ( _ i.e. _ in phase ) with perturbations in doppler velocity , line width , and line asymmetry . this has led to an alternative interpretation as high - velocity upflows as this coherent behaviour is hard to explain with a slow wave scenario @xcite .",

    "this has not closed the debate though .",
    "showed that these periodic line asymmetries could be explained by slow magneto - acoustic waves .",
    "there are many other studies that still show a preference for the slow wave interpretation @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that these pds can have a close connection with type ii spicules @xcite and they have also been linked with the mass cycle of the solar wind @xcite . due to their ubiquitous nature , they could have a significant effect on the coronal energy budget .",
    "recent work by shows a slow , downflow of coronal material , which could be the return component of the up flow .",
    "other articles that consider downflows include and .",
    "this so called `` flows versus waves '' debate has been argued for several years now , with a definitive answer yet to be decided ( if there is one ) . in this article",
    "we study propagating disturbances found at loop foot points , using the _ atmospheric imaging assembly _ ( aia ) onboard the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( sdo ) .",
    "we are going to look at the velocities of these disturbances over a range of different wavelengths and temperatures .",
    "we are going to consider the velocities of these disturbances in different bands , which are dominated by lines formed in a range of temperatures ( , ) .",
    "in particular , we consider the 131 , 171 , and 193    bands . as shown by del zanna _",
    "et al._(2011 ) , for the active - region loops considered here , these three bands are dominated by fe viii , fe ix , and a range of ions ( fe vii  fe xii ) respectively . in ionisation equilibrium , these three bands show emission from plasma formed in a broad range of temperatures , centred around 0.4 , 0.7 , and 1.6 mk @xcite . the other aia bands are more multi - thermal or lack atomic data @xcite .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows : section [ s - observations ] describes the two primary data sets studied in this article .",
    "section [ s - propspeed ] describes how the velocities of the observed pds change with temperature by looking at 131 , 171 , and 193    observations of both data sets . a description of how the properties of the pds change across an active region is described in section [ s - active ] . in section [ s - cool ]",
    "we describe a method to remove the contribution due to cool ions in the 193    passband and the effect this has on the properties of the observed pds .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are presented in section [ s - conclusions ] .",
    "the two primary data sets investigated are aia observations of active regions ar11236 on 22 june 2011 at 15:13ut and ar11301 on 22 september 2011 at 15:01ut .",
    "both data sets have a duration of 40 minutes .",
    "we will focus on the 131,171 , and 193    passbands .",
    "each passband has a cadence of 12 seconds and exposure times of 2.9 , 2.0 , and 2.0s respectively .",
    "each data set has been cleaned and co - aligned using the solarsoft idl command aia_prep and these are then de - rotated .    for each example a 150 @xmath1 150 pixel subsection is chosen to contain a loop footpoint .",
    "a loop is then outlined by two arcs , and divided into cross sections .",
    "this is a very similar technique to that of .",
    "consecutive images are summed to increase the signal to noise ratio and then we calculate a running - difference by subtracting from each image the one taken 96s previously .",
    "this is done to highlight the oscillations since we expect their periods to be approximately three5 minutes .",
    "in this section we look at the two data sets outlined in section [ s - observations ] . we identify a loop and then create running - difference images to identify pds along this loop .",
    "if the pds are slow magneto - acoustic waves then their velocity is expected to be the local sound speed .",
    "the sound speed scales with temperature in the following way ; @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and hence @xmath4 .",
    "the constant is defined as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath7 is the reduced mass , _",
    "i.e. _ the average mass of all particles in the plasma .",
    "therefore , the slow - wave propagation speed ( which is closely related to the sound speed ) is expected to be proportional to the square root of the temperature .",
    "the first aia observation is of active region ar11301 on 22 september 2011 as described in section [ s - observations ] .",
    "the two arcs that outline the strands are shown on the top - left plot of figure [ f - run_diff_22/09 ] .",
    "the loop has solar coordinates of ( -670,204 ) arseconds at 00.35ut . to visualise the oscillations ,",
    "a running - difference is made by subtracting the image 96 seconds earlier from each image .",
    "the running - difference images are shown in figure [ f - run_diff_22/09](b)(d ) for the three different wavelengths .",
    "the overplotted lines in the running - difference images ( b)(d ) represent the gradient of the intensity bands estimated in the 193    passband .",
    "they are overplotted as a visual aid to compare velocities of the pds across the three wavelengths .",
    "the velocities of the pds are calculated from the inverse of the gradient of the intensity bands .",
    "for this example we identified five intensity bands in each wavelength and calculated a range of velocities as in ; the range of possible velocities is estimated from the range of slopes within a given intensity band .",
    "the velocities are displayed in table [ t - one ] .",
    "band 1 is the intensity band closest to the bottom of the running - difference images and band 5 is closest to the top .",
