    "the observed microscopic coexistence between spin - density - wave ( sdw ) and superconducting ( sc ) orders in iron - pnictide superconductors ( fesc )  @xcite implies that sdw transition line extends into the superconducting state .",
    "if this line reaches zero temperature the system develops quantum critical point ( qcp ) beneath superconducting dome .",
    "such a scenario is further complicated by the fact that besides the sdw transition , there is also a nematic transition , below which the tetragonal symmetry of the system is spontaneously broken down to an orthorhombic .",
    "@xcite the transition line of the nematic order also enters the superconducting dome which may lead to yet another qcp .",
    "a magnetic qcp without superconductivity and in the case of nodal fermions in @xmath0-wave superconductors has been a subject of intensive study and is known to give rise to non - fermi liquid behavior , and to singularities in various thermodynamic and transport characteristics .",
    "@xcite the multi - band unconventional superconductivity in fesc brings new intriguing questions concerning the role of qcp in thermodynamic and transport properties of correlated materials .",

    "@xcite specific heat jump @xmath9 displays nonmonotonic dependence on @xmath7 when measured across @xmath8 at the superconducting critical temperature @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite finally , the system obeys linear temperature dependence of the resistivity close to @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite observation of the same set of features in the other families of fescs has been elusive so far since quantum critical effects are easily masked by inhomogeneity and impurity scattering .",
    "bafe@xmath2(as@xmath3p@xmath4)@xmath2 is particularly useful in this regard since the substitution of as by the isovalent ion p does not change the electron / hole balance and does not induce appreciable scattering unlike in the electron - doped ba(fe@xmath3co@xmath4)@xmath2as@xmath2 compound .",

    "it is useful to recall that in bcs theory specific heat jump @xmath13 is universally determined by the total quasiparticle density of states @xmath14 at the fermi surface .",
    "the origin of the strong doping dependence of @xmath15 was rooted  @xcite to the coexistence of sdw magnetism and @xmath16 superconductivity and the mean field theory is in general consistent with experimental observations .",
    "however , the sharply peaked and highly nonmonotonic variation of @xmath11 near @xmath8 as seen in the experiment  @xcite is beyond the mean field treatment and is clearly related to fluctuation effects .",
    "combined accurate data analysis  @xcite on the magneto - oscillations , specific heat jump and magnetic penetration depth near the optimal doping lead to the conjecture that the quasiparticle mass renormalization expected close to a qcp is the main factor which is causing the observed sharp features .",
    "although this is certainly the case for the explanation of the low - temperature @xmath1 measurements , we take the point of view that interpretation of the @xmath15 data obtained near the critical temperature requires an account of thermal fluctuations .    in this work",
    ", we find that thermal sdw fluctuations lead to a dominant contribution to the specific heat jump at the onset of superconducting transition that scales as a power law @xmath17 .",
    "the value of the exponent @xmath18 depends on whether sdw transition is commensurate or incommensurate .",
    "we recall that in the 122-family of iron - pnictides , and possibly in other fescs , optimal doping @xmath8 nearly coincides with the end point of the coexistence region  a tetracritical point @xmath19 .",
    "once the system is tuned to the proximity of the tetracritical point both sdw and sc order parameters develop strong fluctuations . in the quantum case of @xmath20 ,",
    "when the whole fs , except possibly for isolated hot points , is gapped by the non - zero sc order parameter @xmath21 , fluctuation effects are reduced.@xcite on the contrary , near @xmath22 , the sc order parameter vanishes @xmath23 , and sdw fluctuations are not suppressed , giving rise to large thermal corrections .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the minimal two - band model of fescs and discuss emergent phase diagram at the mean field level . in sec .",
    "iii we incorporate fluctuation effects and compute renormalized free energy of the system . in sec .",
    "iv we use the latter to address the scaling of the specific heat jump near the tetracritical point and compare our calculations to the recent experimental findings . in sec .",
    "v we summarize our main results and draw final conclusions .",
    "we consider the minimal two - band low - energy model consisting of one circular hole pocket near the center of the brillouin zone ( bz ) and an electron pocket near its corner .",
    "@xcite away from the perfect nesting electron - like band can be parametrized as follows @xmath25 , where hole band dispersion is assumed quadratic @xmath26 , with @xmath27 .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 captures the relative shift in the fermi energies , and difference in effective masses of the electron and hole bands , via @xmath29 , and an overall ellipticity of the electron band , via @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite in addition , @xmath28 also captures the incommensurability of the sdw order with vector @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the directions of fermi velocity @xmath34 and @xmath31 respectively . for isovalent doping ( @xmath35 ) both @xmath29 and @xmath30 change , as the shape of the bands changes with doping @xmath7 .",
    "earlier calculations show  @xcite that there is a broad parameter range @xmath36 for which sdw order emerges gradually , and its appearance does not destroy sc order ; i.e. , sdw and sc orders coexist over some range of dopings . for simplicity , in our analysis",
    "we assume that only @xmath29 changes , while the ellipticity parameter @xmath30 is fixed , although the picture is expected to stay similar for different choices of dependence of @xmath37 on doping .",
    "the incommensurability vector @xmath31 is an adjustable parameter that minimizes the system free energy in the sdw phase or describes inhomogeneous sdw fluctuations in non - magnetic phases .",
    "the basic hamiltonian for electron - electron interaction includes the free fermion part , and four - fermion interaction terms .",
    "the interaction terms in the band basis are hubbard , hund , and pair - hopping interactions , dressed by coherence factors from the diagonalization of the quadratic form .",
    "there are five different interaction terms in the band basis :  @xcite two density - density intra - pocket interactions ( these interactions are often treated as equal ) , density - density inter - pocket interaction , exchange inter - pocket interaction , and inter - pocket pair hopping .",
    "these five interactions can be rearranged into interactions in the particle - particle channel , and spin- and charge - density - wave particle - hole channels . for repulsive interactions ,",
    "sdw and sc channels are the two most relevant ones .",
    "we decompose these four - fermion interactions by using sdw and sc order parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and express corresponding couplings in terms of the bare transition temperatures @xmath40 to the sc state in the absence of sdw and @xmath41 to the perfectly nested fs in the absence of sc .",
    "thus we arrive at the following free energy density : @xmath42,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 denotes averaging over @xmath32 along fermi surfaces , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are the fermionic matsubara frequencies ( @xmath47 ) . in eq .",

    "@xcite one spurious property of the mean - field analysis when applied to the calculation of the specific heat jump is apparent discontinuity of @xmath9 occurring when the system enters the coexistence region , see lower panels of fig .",
    "the key point to emphasize here is that this singularity gets rounded up and transforms into a sharp peak once we include fluctuations of the sdw order in the paramagnetic phase . indeed , thermodynamic fluctuations are nonzero on both sides of the tetracritical point , and the averages @xmath50 effectively renormalize the superconducting part of the free energy",
    ". similar mechanism of enhancement of @xmath9 has been explored in the context of the heavy fermion superconductors cecoin@xmath51 and ube@xmath52 , which occurs due to the coupling of sc order parameter to fluctuating magnetization of the uncompensated part of the localized @xmath53 moments .",
    "@xcite however , such scenario is not directly applicable to fescs since their magnetism is itinerant and spatial fluctuations of sdw order have long correlation length .",
    "another important remark is that in our free energy , eq .  , we neglected gradient terms of sc order @xmath39 since they give rise only to subleading corrections to @xmath9 . in other words ,",
    "the region of fluctuations is narrower for sc order than for sdw order .",

    "<S> measurements of the specific heat jump at the onset of superconducting transition in the iron - pnictide compounds revealed strong variation of its magnitude as a function of doping that is peaked near the optimal doping . we show that this behavior is direct manifestation of the coexistence between spin - density - wave and superconducting orders and the peak originates from thermal fluctuations of the spin - density - waves near the end point of the coexistence phase  a tetracritical point . </S>",
    "<S> thermal fluctuations result in a power - law dependence of the specific heat jump that is stronger than the contribution of mass renormalization due to quantum fluctuations of spin - density - waves in the vicinity of the putative critical point beneath the superconducting dome . </S>"
