    "recently , the influence of strong magnetic and electric fields on the hot and dense matter , such as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions , has been intensively studied .",
    "the fast - moving nuclei in peripheral collisions could produce extremely strong magnetic fields of the order of @xmath0 in early times @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that such strong magnetic fields could affect the thermal - photon emission @xcite and heavy flavor physics including heavy quarkonium production @xcite and heavy - quark diffusion @xcite in the qgp . moreover , in the presence of chirality imbalance , the magnetic fields may induce charge currents and density waves , namely the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) @xcite and chiral magnetic waves ( cmw ) @xcite .",
    "the effects are one of candidates to understand the asymmetry in the angular distribution of charge particles and difference of the elliptic flows of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "those phenomena can be interpreted in the language of berry phase and the effective chiral kinetic equations ( cke ) , which are obtained by path integral @xcite , hamiltonian approaches @xcite and quantum kinetic theory via wigner functions @xcite . a series of reviews and more references can be found in ref .",
    "in addition to strong magnetic fields , chiral currents and density waves can also be induced by electric fields , named the chiral electric separation effect ( cese ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of electric fields perpendicular to the magnetic fields , chiral hall currents are also expected , called the chiral hall separation effect ( chse ) @xcite , which might cause the asymmetric charge and chirality distribution in rapidity .",
    "those phenomena have drawn lots of attention to the studies of hot and dense matter under the influence of strong magnetic fields .    as a very popular and triumphal tool",
    ", relativistic hydrodynamics has been widely used to study heavy ion collisions ( e.g. see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to investigate those charge and chiral separation effects",
    ", one will consider the combination of relativistic hydrodynamic equation and maxwell s equations , i.e. relativistic magneto - hydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "although the strong magnetic fields decay rapidly in the vacuum @xcite and substantially delayed in the presence of a electrically conducting media @xcite , recent studies from event - by - event simulations show the magnetic energy density can be comparable to fluid energy density in some events at @xmath2 with the impact parameters @xmath3fm @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is still worthy to study relativistic mhd in relativistic heavy ion collisions . to this scope , a numerical code of solving 3 + 1 dimensional mhd is required .",
    "notwithstanding numerical simulations of hydrodynamics successfully describe numbers of experimental measurements , many analytic studies which aim at mimicking nucleus - nucleus collisions have been attempted in order to acquire deeper understandings for numerical results .",
    "following two renown solutions with one - dimensional expansion found by landau @xcite and bjorken @xcite , one of recent improvements is made by gubser to incorporate the transverse expansion on top of the bjorken s solution for conformal fluids @xcite .",
    "based on the approach in gubser s solution , refined solutions have been found @xcite and applied to evaluate anisotropic flow in comparison with experimental data @xcite . along the same direction ,",
    "an analytic solution in 3 + 1 dimensional hydrodynamics with rapidity dependence has been introduced recently @xcite . in the same spirit",
    ", we would like to investigate some well - known hydrodynamic models in the framework of mhd and seek for analytic solutions .",
    "the study was initiated by one of the authors of this paper , where an one - dimensional fluid following longitudinal boost - invariant expansion as the bjorken flow with a transverse and time - dependent magnetic field has been investigated @xcite . in ideal mhd limits ,",
    "i.e. the infinite conductivity and no dissipative effects , it is remarkable that the decay of energy density is the same as the case without magnetic fields because of `` frozen - flux theorem '' @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", the magnetization effect is added to the bjorken flow with mhd . also see ref.@xcite , where the authors considered 3 + 1 d numerical hydrodynamics with an effective source driven by magnetization . in the presence of an external homogeneous magnetic field in a power - law decay @xmath4 with @xmath5 being proper time and @xmath6 being an arbitrary number , the solutions are distinguished between the scenarios in which the magnetic field decays more slowly or more rapidly than in the ideal - mhd case , where the former corresponds to @xmath7 and the latter corresponds to @xmath8 . for the case",
    "@xmath9 , it goes back to the ideal mhd . in the first scenario , the decay of energy density is faster than the case without mangetic field . while , in the second scenario , the decay of energy density slows down .",
    "in this work , we will consider the system with an inhomogeneous external magnetic field compared to the previous case with a homogeneous one in the transverse plane @xcite .",
    "since the energy density of the fluid is modified as shown in the homogeneous case @xcite , one may intuitively expect that the spatial gradient of the magnetic field may further induce inhomogeneity of the energy distribution and engender anisotropic flow in the transverse plane .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume the external magnetic fields are small compared to the fluid energy density .",
    "therefore , we can neglect the coupled maxwell s equations and solve the conservation equations perturbatively and analytically .",
    "after that , we will discuss the anistropic transverse flow induced by the inhomogenous magnetic fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[solving ] ,",
    "we solve the mhd equations with a transverse external magnetic field perturbatively by approximating the spatial dependence of magnetic fields via the fourier decomposition and obtain the analytic solution for each moment up to the leading - order corrections . in sec.[aniso_flow",
    "] , we then employ our solution to a concrete example and discuss the modifications of fluid velocity and energy density .",
    "finally , we make conclusions and outlook in the last section .",
    "we consider an inviscid fluid coupled to a magnetic field @xmath10 . in the flat spacetime @xmath11 , the general form of the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 here @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 correspond to the four velocity of fluid , energy density , and pressure , respectively . also , @xmath17 represents the levi - civita tensor . in our convention , the velocity of the fluid satisfies @xmath18 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor should follow the conservation equations @xmath19 .",
    "in general , the presence of external fields may induce internal electromagnetic fields of the fluid , where the latter are dictated by maxwell s equations .",
    "one should thus solve the conservation equations and maxwell s equations coupled to each other . in this work ,",
    "we only focus on the effects of an external magnetic fields and discard the back - reaction from the internal fields . since the external magnetic field is generated by external sources , it can take an arbitrary form",
    ". therefore , the energy - momentum tensor will be solely governed by the conservation equations . by implementing the projection of @xmath19 along the longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to @xmath14 , one can rewrite the conservation equations as @xmath20 where @xmath21 .    to simplify the problem and",
    "qualitatively delineate the practical condition in heavy ion collisions , we assume that the external magnetic field is perpendicular to the reaction plane , which depends on only one of transverse coordinates and the proper time @xmath5 for an fluid following the bjorken expansion in the longitudinal direction . nevertheless , we also present the results for a magnetic field depending on @xmath5 and rapidity @xmath22 in appendix [ rapidity ] .",
    "here we assume that the magnitude of the magnetic field is suppressed by the energy density of the fluid , @xmath23 , which allows us to neglect nonlinear effects in @xmath24 .",
    "practically , such an assumption is not far from the scenario in heavy ion collisions , in which the magnetic field drops rapidly with respect to time @xcite .",
    "for example , the ratio of magnetic energy density over the fluid energy density is @xmath25 in a typical au - au collisions at @xmath26gev @xcite .",
    "although the nonlinear effects are substantial in very early times , in most of the time period in hydrodynamic evolution , the magnetic field could be subleading compared with the energy density of the fluid .",
    "moreover , we impose the conformal invariance for the equation of state , which gives @xmath27 .",
    "we now seek the perturbative solution in the presence of a weak external magnetic field pointing along the @xmath28 direction in an inviscid fluid following the bjorken expansion along the @xmath29 direction , where @xmath30 depends on @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the setup reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath5 is rescaled by an initial time @xmath35 and @xmath36 represents the initial energy density of the medium at @xmath35 . in the following calculations , we will implicitly rescale @xmath32 by @xmath35 as well .",
    "we introduce @xmath37 as an expansion parameter in calculations , which will be set to unity in the end . in such setup ,",
    "the conservation equations in ( [ cons_original ] ) reduce to two coupled differential equations . up to @xmath38 , the two differential equations are @xmath39 the combination of two equations above yields a partial differential equation solely depending on @xmath40 , @xmath41    now , the solution of @xmath42 depends on the explicit form of @xmath43 . here",
    "we consider the case when the @xmath5 dependence and @xmath32 dependence of @xmath30 are separable .",
    "when @xmath44 , ( [ equ_xdep ] ) is a homogeneous partial differential equation , which can be solved by separation of variables .",
    "the general solution takes the form , @xmath45 + a^m_2\\tau^{2/3}y_{\\frac{1}{3}}\\left[\\frac{m\\tau}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right]\\right)\\left[\\cos(mx)+a^m_3\\sin(mx)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 can be real or imaginary numbers and @xmath47 are integration constants . to find the solution for @xmath48",
    ", we may rewrite @xmath49 into a fourier series on the bases of the @xmath32-dependence part of the general solution .",
    "this is the key step to convert the solution of a partial differential equation into the summation of solutions of ordinary differential equations although the trick is only valid for a finite region where the spatial part of @xmath30 can be accurately approximated by the fourier series . since the magnetic field generated in peripheral heavy ion collisions should be even with respect to @xmath32 and most prominent at @xmath50 on the transverse plane , we may decompose it into a cosine series @xmath51 where @xmath52 are now real integers . for simplicity , we may further assume that @xmath53 for @xmath54 with @xmath55 being constants , which approximately characterizes the decay of magnetic fields in heavy ion collisions .",

    "however , the @xmath137 with larger @xmath136 may increases in early times .",
    "in general , there exists no substantial hierarchy of @xmath137 at fixed @xmath32 with different values of @xmath104 in early times .",
    "furthermore , as shown in fig.[v_x_plot_diffn ] at @xmath138 , we find that the @xmath137 first increase from @xmath50 and then turn over at intermediate @xmath32 and gradually decrease with @xmath32 .",
    "for @xmath125 , the velocity profile has a similar shape compared with the cases for @xmath131 , while the direction becomes positive .",
    "in contrast , according to fig.[e1_tau_plot_diffn ] , the increase of @xmath139 at @xmath50 with smaller @xmath136 is observed for almost all times except for @xmath140 as further shown in fig.[e1_x_plot_diffn ] . in fig.[e1_x_plot_diffn ] , we find that the correction on energy density could become positive at larger @xmath32 , whereas there exists no clear hierarchy in such a regime . nonetheless , we should mention the caveat that @xmath134 and @xmath99 shown in fig.[v_x_plot_diffn ] and fig.[e1_x_plot_diffn ] are unreliable near @xmath141 , where the approximation of the magnetic field in fourier series breakdowns . in the fringes @xmath142 ,",

    "we may still conjecture the qualitative behaviors near the fringes based on our approximated solutions . in fig.[v_x_plot_diffn ] , our approximated solutions of @xmath137 gradually decreases with @xmath32 and reach zero at @xmath144 , while the genuine solutions in principle should decay slower and asymptotically coincide with zero at @xmath145 .",
    "the qualitative behavior of @xmath99 near the fringes is more difficult to analyze because it depends on the competition between @xmath78 and @xmath30 , in which the former causes suppression for @xmath130 and the latter yields enhancement from the second equation of ( [ two_cons_xdep ] ) . note that @xmath146 in our convention and thus @xmath147 and @xmath148 are negative for @xmath131 .",

    "we may consider two extreme cases , which correspond to @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "for @xmath158 , the time scale of the magnetic field is much shorter than the one for the expanding medium , we thus approximate such a condition as a static medium in the presence of a time - decreasing magnetic field @xmath159 with a gaussian distribution in @xmath32 . the total magnetic flux going through the medium now drops with respect to time .",
    "the medium is thus pushed inward to the central region @xmath50 in order to preserve the flux . on the contrary , for @xmath157",
    ", the magnetic field decays much slower than the expansion of the medium .",
    "we thus approximate the situation with the presence of a static magnetic field @xmath160 as a gaussian function of @xmath32 in a medium expanding along the @xmath29 direction .",
    "in such a case , the total magnetic flux of the medium increases with respect to time . to reduce the flux , the medium hence expands along the @xmath161 directions . the case for @xmath95 may correspond to the situation in which the magnetic flux is balanced by the expansion of the medium and the decrease of the magnetic field , which thus results in the absence of transverse flow .",
    "note that the medium here can only change the flux via the expansion or compression in the transverse direction due to the absence of induced electromagnetic fields and currents . on the other hand ,",
    "the correction on the energy density is affected by both the change of fluid velocity and magnetic field , which varies case by case with different values of @xmath104 .",
    "nevertheless , for the peculiar case @xmath95 , one finds that the decrease of the magnetic field always reduces the energy density .",
    "before we end this section , we also plot the ratio @xmath162 as a function of @xmath5 for different @xmath104 and @xmath32 shown in fig .",
    "[ b_eps_tau ] and [ b_eps_x ] , where @xmath15 is the total fluid energy density .",
    "since in relativistic heavy ion collisions , the energy density of magnetic fields is expected to decay much faster than the fluid energy density , in fig .",
    "[ b_eps_tau ] we only plot the case @xmath163 . for a smaller value of @xmath104 ,",
    "i.e. the magnetic field decays faster , the ratio is smaller .",
    "similarly , in fig . [ b_eps_x ] the absolute value of @xmath49 becomes smaller when @xmath32 increases , but the fluid energy density is approximately homogeneous .",
    "therefore , the ratio reduces when @xmath32 increases .",
    "in this work , we study a toy model of magnetohydrodynamics in the presence of a transverse external magnetic field with spacetime dependence under the bjorken expansion . in our setup , the medium is boost - invariant along the @xmath29 direction and the magnetic field as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath32 points along the @xmath28 direction .",
    "we obtain the leading - order solutions in the weak - field approximation , where both the energy density and fluid velocity are modified .",
    "particularly , the spatial gradient of the magnetic field engenders transverse flow parallel or anti - parallel to @xmath32 , while the direction and magnitude of flow are determined by the time evolution of the magnetic field . for the magnetic field following power - law decay in proper time such that @xmath164 , the transverse flow propagates inward for @xmath130 and outward for @xmath131 based on the conservation of magnetic flux in the expanding medium .",
    "the flow vanishes for @xmath95 , which corresponds to the case such that the longitudinal expansion of the medium compensates the decrease of magnetic field .",
    "in addition , the energy density is generally reduced in the central region , while it can be enhanced in the outskirts depending on the competing effects between the transverse velocity and the magnetic field .",
    "in general , our study in simple setup may provide better understandings for the influence from spatial gradient of magnetic fields on magnetohydrodynamics . although we choose the gaussian distribution as one particular example for the space - dependent magnetic field , the same approach can be applied to other spatial distribution given that the interested regime can be approximated by fourier decomposition .",
    "since the analytic expressions of each moment is found , one can directly compute the transverse velocity and correction on energy density by just inputting the fourier coefficients . in the end of conclusions",
    ", we would like to reemphasize that this study is a theoretical discussion , which may be far away from phenomenology in heavy ion collisions .",
    "our solutions might be close to the 2 + 1 dimensional bjorken flow with transverse magnetic fields near the initial time when the weak - field approximation becomes valid but the transverse flow led by the medium expansion is not fully developed . here",
    "we may further address the validity of our weak - field expansion compared to the practical conditions in heavy ion collisions . according to the numerical simulations @xcite , the magnetic fields generated in peripheral collisions in rhic at @xmath165 are about @xmath166 @xmath167 , whereas the magnitudes may drop to ten times smaller at @xmath168 fm as the onset of hydrodynamic evolution . assuming the initial temperature of the qgp is about @xmath169 mev",
    ", one finds @xmath170 by taking @xmath171 mev and @xmath172 . as a result ,",
    "the weak - field expansion in our calculations could be a legitimate approximation for the magnetic fields generated in rhic .",
    "it is helpful to use our analytical results to test real numerical mhd in the future .",
    "on the other hand , our study can be generalized along many directions .",
    "we may couple the conservation equation to electromagnetic currents , which is essential for analyzing the presence of chemical potential or chiral anomalous effects . to make further connection with heavy ion collisions , the transverse expansion of the medium by itself should be included .",
    "the anisotropic flow should be simultaneously affected by the expansion of the medium along both the longitudinal and transverse directions and also the spacetime - varying magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , the viscous effect could be involved as well .",
    "how significant the modification from magnetic fields on the flow harmonics measured in experiments is thus relies on the full numerical simulations , which could be affected by the initial conditions chosen for simulations as well .",
    "although the transverse flow led by a inhomogeneous magnetic field shown in this paper is symmetric with respect to the @xmath28 axis , the flow pattern could become asymmetric from an asymmetric distribution of @xmath30 or the presence of @xmath173 . based on the event - by - event fluctuations @xcite",
    ", the magnitude of @xmath173 could be comparable with the magnitude of @xmath30 .",
    "consequently , except for the even harmonics , the flow engendered by spatial inhomogeneity of magnetic fields may possibly affect the odd harmonics in heavy ion collisions as well . on the other hand , in order to gain more insights for the early - time physics",
