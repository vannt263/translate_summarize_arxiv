    "porous media have large surface areas , and consequently interfacial energy contributes significantly to their behavior .",
    "the energetic cost of the solid - vacuum interface in an empty porous medium produces a stress on the matrix ; when fluid is adsorbed the interfacial energy may decrease , reducing the stress on the matrix and allowing it to expand .",
    "as more fluid is adsorbed , liquid begins to capillary condense , creating a large number of curved liquid - vapor interfaces throughout the sample .",
    "the energy of these liquid - vapor interfaces creates another stress which may result in contraction of the porous medium .",
    "the expansion of a porous medium upon adsorption of fluids has been observed in a number of systems over the past century@xcite ; contraction has also been observed@xcite .",
    "aerogels present a somewhat different system than the denser porous media since they are composed of a very low density network of silica strands , often with total porosities over 95% . as such they have very low elastic constants , with most elastic strain being accounted for by the bending and twisting of the strands@xcite rather than compression of the silica making up those strands .",
    "therefore the effective elastic constants for aerogels can be orders of magnitude smaller than bulk silica , and aerogels are very sensitive to small changes in stress caused by interfacial energy .",
    "a porous medium exposed to vapor at low pressure collects a thin film on the surface of the pores . as vapor pressure",
    "is increased this film thickens slowly until the fluid suddenly capillary condenses at some pressure below bulk saturation .",
    "liquid invades the pores over a narrow pressure range , driven by the pressure difference across the curved liquid - vapor interface within the pores . while this pressure difference may be small compared to the elastic constants of typical solids , it can be comparable to the bulk moduli of low density aerogels .",
    "in such a situation the forces generated by the liquid - vapor interface during capillary condensation can deform the medium measurably .",
    "the capillary forces generated by water in aerogel are sufficient to completely crush the gel  a fact known to anyone who has accidentally gotten a drop of water on a hydrophilic aerogel .",
    "deformation of aerogel during liquid nitrogen adsorption and desorption has been measured by reichenauer and scherer@xcite for some aerogels with densities between @xmath0 ( porosities between 88% and 93% ) with a view to incorporating the distortion of the aerogel into existent methods of determining pore sizes from n@xmath1 adsorption isotherms .",
    "the aerogels in that study had young s moduli of @xmath2mpa ( implying a bulk modulus of about 2mpa ) and greater , much larger than the aerogels in this study .",
    "their aerogels exhibited large changes in volume during capillary condensation , and were permanently damaged by the process .",
    "they also observed that information about the elastic properties of their samples could be extracted from the isotherms .",
    "the high surface tension and large contact angle of mercury prevents it from entering the pores of aerogels when placed in a mercury porosimeter . in this case",
    "the surface tension is so great that when the aerogel is subjected to large pressures it plastically deforms@xcite , down to a fraction of its original volume .",
    "shen and monson performed a monte carlo study of fluid adsorption in a flexible porous network which resembled a high porosity aerogel@xcite .",
    "their simulated adsorption isotherms showed that the flexibility of the network had a large effect on the adsorption isotherms , and that the network exhibited a large volumetric change , especially during desorption .",
    "aerogels are widely used as a method to introduce a `` quenched impurity '' into a fluid , often with the goal of exploring the effect of fixed disorder on fluid order and phase transitions .",
    "experiments with quantum fluids have included @xmath3he@xcite , @xmath4he@xcite , and @xmath3he-@xmath4he mixtures@xcite .",
    "liquid crystals in aerogels@xcite have also been widely studied .",
    "implicit in all of these studies is an assumption that the structure of the aerogel is not affected by the fluid within its pores , nor is the aerogel altered during filling or emptying .",
    "while studying the temperature and porosity dependence of adsorption isotherms in aerogels@xcite , we noticed that the isotherm shapes might be showing effects from the deformation of the aerogel by the adsorbed fluid .",
    "this study is aimed at quantifying the degree of aerogel deformation during helium adsorption at a variety of temperatures .",
    "we have measured the macroscopic linear strain in two different low density aerogels during adsorption and desorption of low surface tension fluids .",
    "our measurements included an isotherm of neon adsorbed in a @xmath5 ( @xmath6 porosity ) silica aerogel at 43k and several isotherms of helium adsorbed in a @xmath7 ( 95% porosity ) silica aerogel at temperatures from 2.4k to 5.0k .",
    "at these temperatures the fluid surface tensions were small , but the low elastic constants of the aerogels allowed a significant deformation nevertheless . the compression of the aerogel was greatest during desorption . from the isotherms",
    "we show that the degree of compression during capillary condensation within the aerogel is directly related to the surface tension of the adsorbate .",
    "furthermore , the bulk modulus of the aerogel was extracted from the adsorption and desorption isotherms .",
    "the compression due to capillary condensation has not previously been studied in such compliant materials . by using high porosity aerogels",
    ", we were able to directly observe , for the first time , the deformation associated with low surface tension fluids like helium . by making measurements very slowly , we avoided rate dependent effects and were able to study the hysteresis between compression during filling and emptying of aerogels .",
    "our measurements extended close to helium s critical point , which allowed us to vary the surface tension over a wide range compared to previous measurements , which used nitrogen and much more rigid samples . from our results , it is clear that the deformation associated with surface tension must be taken into account when interpreting adsorption isotherms and to avoid damage when filling high porosity aerogels .",
    "the aerogel samples were synthesized in our lab from tetramethyl orthosilicate ( tmos ) using a standard one - step base catalyzed method followed by supercritical extraction of the methanol solvent@xcite .",
    "the two aerogels studied had densities of @xmath7 and @xmath5 , corresponding to porosities of 95% and slightly less than 98% respectively .",
    "they are referred to as aerogels `` b110 '' and `` b51 '' throughout this paper .",
    "both aerogel samples were cut into cylinders about 1 cm long .",
    "b51 , used in the first experiment , was about 1.2 cm in diameter  it equilibrated so slowly that it took weeks to measure a single isotherm . to reach thermal equilibrium more quickly ,",
    "a smaller sample of b110 ( 4 mm in diameter ) was used for the second experiment",
    ".    our linear variable differential transformer ( lvdt ) allowed us to make high precision , non - contact measurements of the relative position of a cylindrical ferromagnetic core and a set of primary and secondary coils .",
    "the response of the lvdt was highly temperature dependent , and room temperature calibrations were not used to interpret the low temperature data . in the liquid helium cryostat it was possible to make a direct calibration of the lvdt , but for measurements with neon an approximate calibration had to be computed from the adsorption isotherm itself ( as will be explained later ) .",
    "two experimental cells were used over the course of this experiment to accommodate the two different aerogel samples .",
    "both cells were made of copper and had the same general layout , with the lvdt core supported about 2 cm above the sample by a thin brass rod .",
    "the support was kept in contact with the sample by gravity , and the cells kept upright once assembled .",
    "the initial position of the external lvdt coils relative to the core was controlled through set screws .    in our initial experiment neon",
    "was admitted to the experimental cell containing b51 in volumetric shots from a room temperature gas handling system , and pressure measurements were made with a room temperature gauge .",

    "the fluid condensation into the system was controlled by stepping the pressure in the cell through the use of a low temperature pressure regulation ballast@xcite .",

    "we could not perform a direct calibration of the lvdt at 43k because there was no direct access to the lvdt within the cryostat ; however , as shown by reichenauer and scherer@xcite , information can be extracted about the sample shrinkage from the adsorption isotherm itself .",
    "since capillary condensation occurs over a narrow pressure range ( @xmath15 ) , the liquid can be treated as incompressible during capillary condensation .",
    "the high density corners of the adsorption and desorption isotherms ( points``b '' and `` d '' in fig .",
    "[ lvdtne43k3panes]a respectively ) correspond to the aerogel being full of liquid , but compressed because of capillary forces at the surface pores . after capillary condensation was complete in this sample , the aerogel continued to adsorb fluid up until bulk saturation was reached ( just below point `` c '' ) .",
    "the significant slope of the isotherm between capillary condensation and bulk condensation ( i.e.  @xmath16 ) indicates that the aerogel was still adsorbing liquid even though there was no longer any vapor within the pores . by measuring how much fluid was adsorbed after the completion of capillary condensation it is possible to calculate",
    "how much swelling occurred in the aerogel over this pressure range .",
    "the degree of swelling can then be used to form a calibration for the lvdt .",
    "the bulk neon vapor at 43k has a high density and the cell included a large bulk volume , so the total amount of neon admitted into the cell does not correspond to the amount of neon adsorbed by the aerogel .",
    "however , since we are dealing with such a small pressure range during capillary condensation we can assume that all neon admitted over the pressure range @xmath17 is adsorbed by the aerogel  the bulk vapor density changes very little over this range .",

    "then , as neon began to capillary condense near point a , the aerogel contracted reaching a maximum linear compression of almost 2% at point b. at this point the gel was full of liquid , but compressed from its original volume .",
    "as more neon was added to the cell it was adsorbed by the aerogel , allowing the gel to relax and expand .",
    "once the gel was full and bulk liquid began collecting ( at point c , @xmath26moles ) , there were no longer any curved liquid - vapor interfaces causing stress within the aerogel and it had re - expanded to its original size . upon desorption of the neon , the process occurred in reverse ; however during desorption the aerogel was linearly compressed by almost 3.5% at point d. by point e the aerogel had re - expanded  in this pressure regime only a film of neon remains on the silica strands .",
    "however , the gel did not fully return to its original size ; there was a slight permanent deformation ( about 0.2% linear compression ) .",
    "hysteresis is generally observed for adsorption of fluids in porous media  the adsorption and desorption of the fluid taking place at different partial pressures .",
    "the precise mechanism of this hysteresis is an open question for aerogels , but it may indicate a different liquid - vapor interface shape for adsorption and desorption .",
    "the lower partial pressure for desorption means that there exists a greater pressure difference across the curved liquid - vapor interface , and results in a greater maximum stress on the aerogel during desorption .",
    "the portion of the isotherms closest to @xmath27 are identical for the emptying and filling branches of the isotherm ; in this region the gel is full of liquid and the aerogel matrix is swelling or shrinking in response to the pressure difference across the liquid - vapor interface present at the aerogel surface rather than interfaces within the pores .",
    "the second experimental cell , used to investigate helium adsorption in aerogel , allowed more precise compression and pressure measurements .",
    "it also allowed a direct low temperature calibration for the lvdt .",
    "the lvdt calibration was reproducible to within about 1% upon thermal cycling . since the sample had a smaller diameter than the b51 sample , the pressure exerted by the weight of the ferromagnetic core was larger .",

    ". as the temperature was raised , the surface tension of the helium decreased , causing less deformation of the aerogel .",

    "no contraction was observed , as would be expected without a liquid - vapor interface .",
    "consistent with an earlier study@xcite , dilation of the aerogel during the initial stages of helium adsorption was observed at all temperatures studied .",
    "the maximum dilation depended much less on temperature than did the deformation during capillary condensation  in all cases it was just under 0.1% of the total sample length .",
    "this is consistent with the dilation being governed by the energetics of adsorption sites on the silica strands , which can involve binding energies much larger the liquid - vapor interfacial energy or the thermal energy at liquid helium temperatures .      during fluid adsorption and desorption , curved liquid - vapor interfaces abound within the open aerogel pore structure .",
    "a laplace pressure exists across each of these interfaces , which can place stress on the aerogel .",
    "the laplace pressure is a purely mechanical construct , with the surface tension ( @xmath31 ) across the interface responsible for the pressure difference between the liquid ( @xmath32 ) and vapor ( @xmath33 ) phases : @xmath34 assuming a hemispherical interface or radius @xmath35 .",
    "usually the porous medium is assumed to be rigid , but aerogels are extraordinarily compliant , and any stresses must be balanced by deformation of the aerogel .",
    "once the aerogel is completely filled with liquid , the liquid - vapor interface exists only at the aerogel surface and the laplace pressure is felt as a macroscopic stress .",

    "this derivation assumes that the liquid and vapor are incompressible , which is a fairly accurate approximation given the small pressure ranges over which capillary condensation occurs in aerogels .",

    "the gel was full of liquid and the pressure difference between the liquid and vapor phases was balanced by the elastic stress of the aerogel .",
    "if the deformation of the aerogels is isotropic then the bulk modulus , k@xmath40 , can be used to characterize its response to the stress exerted by the liquid - vapor interface .    for high porosity aerogels and small deformations ( i.e.@xmath41 ) the sample experiences this pressure difference as a compressive stress , which gives : @xmath42",
    "thus we can extract a value for k@xmath40 from the slope of each isotherm when plotted as @xmath43 , without needing to know either the fluid s surface tension or the aerogel s pore size .",
    "in fact , measurements on this portion of our isotherm , where the aerogel is full but partially compressed , can not tell us about the effective pore size .",
    "that information ( r@xmath44 ) comes from the `` breakthrough radius , '' the point at which the meniscus curvature @xmath35 becomes equal to an effective pore size during desorption and the interface becomes unstable so that the pores suddenly empty .",
    "if we know the liquid s surface tension and the pressure , @xmath33 , at which pores begin to empty , we can determine a pore size , @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , this is a standard way of determining pore size from isotherms  there is no need to measure sample deformation @xmath46l , the desorption pressure is all that is necessary . assuming the simplest ( hemispherical ) form for the meniscus , then at breakthrough : @xmath47 a similar calculation can define a radius during adsorption , although its meaning is less clear .",
    "this derivation assumes that the liquid and vapor are incompressible , which is a fairly accurate approximation given the small pressure ranges over which capillary condensation occurs in aerogels .",
    "more commonly one assumes the vapor behaves like an ideal gas and the liquid molar volume is much smaller and can be neglected .",
    "this gives the more familiar form of the kelvin equation : @xmath48 neither of these assumptions is appropriate near the liquid - vapor critical point , so we use the form in eq .",

    "[ lvdtne43k3panes ] yields a bulk modulus of k=0.065mpa for aerogel b51 .",

    "compression of aerogels at room temperature leads to bulk densification and important microstructural changes in the sample .",
    "such changes have been investigated@xcite during the room temperature densification of silica aerogels in a mercury porosimeter .",
    "three characteristics of the aerogel structure were measured  the fractal dimension , the solid particle size , and the cluster size ( or correlation length ) .",
    "as the aerogel was compressed the particle size remained unchanged , consistent with the silica particles ( that compose the aerogel strands ) being relatively unaffected by small pressures .",
    "however , the fractal dimension of the aerogels increased slightly , and the correlation length decreased significantly , during compression .",
    "these three factors are all very important in determining how fluids are affected by the presence of aerogel , and they are usually assumed to remain constant throughout an experiment . however , if the aerogel is compressed during the experiment these factors may change .",
    "the increase in aerogel density is generally assumed to be due to the preferential collapse of the largest `` pores , '' with relatively little damage to the smallest scale structures .",
    "however , the presence of large , open , pores is what distinguishes aerogel from other porous media and any damage to this structure may have dramatic effects on the behavior of fluids within the aerogels . to avoid such damage , one must be careful to avoid capillary stresses that could deform the gel beyond its elastic limit . the safest way to fill or empty an aerogel is above the liquid - vapor critical point , where no liquid - vapor interface exists .",
    "however , using calculations such as those shown in table  [ tableradii ] allows one to estimate the degree of deformation induced during filling and emptying at lower temperatures , and a filling temperature can be chosen that does not allow the sample to experience plastic deformation .",

    "the volumetric compression of the aerogel by about 10% during desorption is a significant portion of this , so that compression is a very important part of the capillary condensation behavior .",

    "[ lvdtne43k3panes ] would be spread out over a wider range , from point a to point c if the aerogel was rigid ) .",
    "simultaneously , the isotherms become steeper in a compliant material like aerogels since effective pore radius decreases during compression ( by up to 3.5% ) .",
