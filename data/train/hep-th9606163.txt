    "these components satisfy the operator product expansions  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the central charge of the cft and @xmath5 means `` up to the terms that are regular as @xmath6 '' .",
    "these ope , together with the regularity condition @xmath7 as @xmath8 , are used to construct verma modules for the virasoro algebra that correspond to the holomorphic and anti - holomorphic sectors of a cft .",

    "a cft is determined by the complete set of correlation functions among the primary fields , which are built up of conformal blocks : the correlation functions for the holomorphic sector .",
    "the conformal blocks are defined by the conformal ward identities of bpz  @xcite , which follow from the ope for the primary fields . introducing the generating functional for the @xmath12-point correlation functions @xmath13(z_1 , \\dots , z_n)\\ } & = \\bigl\\langle{\\mathbf{o}}_1(z_1 ) \\dots { \\mathbf{o}}_n(z_n ) \\exp\\biggl(-\\frac { 1}{\\pi } \\int_{{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{c } } } } } \\mu(z , \\bar{z})\\,{\\mathbf{t}}(z ) { \\operatorname{d}}^2 z \\biggr)\\bigr\\rangle \\\\ & { \\overset{\\text{def}}{=}}\\langle { \\mathbf{o}}_1(z_1 ) \\cdots { \\mathbf{o}}_n(z_n)\\rangle_{\\mu},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integration goes over the complex plane @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the cwi can be written in the following `` universal form '' ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "describing the complete solution of this equation , as well as of its generalization for higher genus riemann surfaces , is one of the major problems of cft .",
    "this problem remains non - trivial even in the simplest case of conformal blocks without primary fields , when the generating functional @xmath19 $ ] takes the form @xmath20\\}=\\bigl\\langle\\exp\\biggl\\{-\\frac{1}{\\pi } \\int_{{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{c } } } } } \\mu(z , \\bar{z})\\ , { \\mathbf{t}}(z)\\,{\\operatorname{d}}^2\\ ! z\\biggr\\ } \\bigr\\rangle { \\overset{\\text{def}}{=}}\\langle \\operatorname{i}\\rangle_{\\mu}\\ , .\\ ] ] it gives the expectation value of the unit operator @xmath21 in the presence of the schwinger s source term @xmath22 , which is a characteristic feature of all cft with the same central charge @xmath4 .",

    "the functional @xmath37 can be considered as a wzw type functional since its definition requires an additional integration over a path in the field space .",

    "therefore , one has the fundamental relation @xmath45=\\frac{c}{24 \\pi } s[f],\\ ] ] which expresses @xmath37 as a local functional of @xmath32 and which can be verified directly .",
    "this relation provides the interpretation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) of two - dimensional induced gravity in the conformal gauge in terms of a gravitational wznw model ( and hence in terms of a chern - simons functional as well ) .    in the present paper",
    "we formulate and solve the analog of the equation for the stress - energy tensor on a compact riemann surface of genus @xmath0 .",
    "as in the genus zero case , it provides an invariant formulation of the chiral sector in two - dimensional induced gravity on higher genus riemann surfaces , a solution to the problem discussed in  @xcite . from a different point of view , this problem was also considered in  @xcite .",
    "first , it should be noted that it is trivial to generalize the genus zero treatment to the case of elliptic curves  compact riemann surfaces of genus @xmath46 .",
    "namely , let @xmath47 be an elliptic curve realized as the quotient @xmath48 of the complex plane @xmath14 by the action of a rank @xmath49 lattice @xmath50 generated by @xmath46 and @xmath51 , with @xmath52 .",
    "the analog of the equation has the same form , where @xmath22 is now a doubly - periodic function on @xmath14 , while the corresponding normalized solution @xmath32 of the beltrami equation has the property @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "it follows that @xmath55 where @xmath56 , the rank @xmath49 lattice in @xmath14 generated by @xmath46 and @xmath57 . as a result ,",
    "the functional @xmath58 $ ] has the same form as in , where now the integration goes over the fundamental parallelogram @xmath59 of the lattice @xmath50 .",
    "having thus addressed the genus @xmath46 case , we start by formulating equation the same applies to the universal cwi as well  on a compact riemann surface @xmath47 of genus @xmath0 . in order to do",
    "it one needs to use projective connections on @xmath47 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for details ) .",
    "namely , recall  @xcite that the stress - energy tensor @xmath60 of a cft on a riemann surface is @xmath61 times a projective connection .",
    "therefore the expectation value @xmath62 is a holomorphic projective connection on @xmath47 which depends on the particular cft .",
    "the difference between two projective connections on @xmath47 is a quadratic differential , so that in order to define the generating functional for the stress - energy tensor on @xmath47 , one can choose a `` background '' holomorphic projective connection @xmath63 and set @xmath64\\}=\\bigl\\langle \\exp \\biggl\\{-\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_x \\mu(z,\\bar{z})\\ , ( { \\mathbf{t}}(z)-\\frac{c}{12}r(z)){\\operatorname{d}}^2\\ ! z\\,\\biggr\\ } \\bigr\\rangle\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a beltrami differential on @xmath47 .",
    "the analog of equation takes the form  @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a local complex coordinate on @xmath47 , and was used in  @xcite .",
    "as it follows from the definition of @xmath37 , @xmath67 and this expectation value can be set to zero if one chooses @xmath68 . however , when working with all conformal field theories on @xmath47 having the same central charge @xmath4 , it is preferrable to have a canonical choice of the holomorphic projective connection @xmath63 .",
    "one possibility , which is the choice we will adopt in this paper , is to use a fuchsian projective connection .",
    "it is defined by the fuchsian uniformization of the riemann surface @xmath47 , i.e.  by its realization as a quotient @xmath69 of the upper half - plane @xmath70 by the action of a strictly hyperbolic fuchsian group @xmath71 with @xmath72 generators .",
    "the upper half plane is isomorphic to the universal cover of @xmath47 , while @xmath71 , as an abstract group , is isomorphic to @xmath73 , the fundamental group of the surface @xmath47 .",
    "note that the fuchsian uniformization of riemann surfaces plays a fundamental role in the geometric approach to the two - dimensional quantum gravity through quantum liouville theory ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the covering @xmath74 allows to pull - back geometric objects from @xmath47 to @xmath70 .",
    "since the fuchsian projective connection tautologically vanishes on @xmath70 , the stress - energy tensor @xmath1 becomes a quadratic differential for the fuchsian group @xmath71 @xmath75 whereas the source term @xmath22 becomes a beltrami differential for @xmath71 @xmath76 the product @xmath77 is a @xmath78-tensor for @xmath71 , so that the integral @xmath79 the natural pairing between quadratic and beltrami differentials  is well - defined , i.e.  it does not depend on the choice of the fundamental domain @xmath80 of the fuchsian group @xmath71 . as a result ,",
    "the functional @xmath19 $ ] retains the same form as in formula , where now the integration goes over the domain @xmath81 , and satisfies the same equation , with @xmath82 .",
    "it should be noted that the expectation value of @xmath83 is no longer zero when @xmath84 , but rather is @xmath61 times a holomorphic quadratic differential @xmath85 , which is the pull - back to @xmath70 of the quadratic differential @xmath86 on @xmath47 and characterizes a particular cft .",
    "thus , as it was observed in  @xcite , the generating functional for the stress - energy tensor on a higher genus riemann surface is no longer a universal feature of all conformal field theories with the same value of @xmath4 .",
    "however , as we shall show in the paper , one can still find the general solution of the equation .",
    "next , in order to solve the universal cwi and to define an action functional for the chiral sector in two - dimensional induced gravity on @xmath47 , one could first try to extend polyakov s functional from @xmath14 to @xmath47 by considering the following integral @xmath87\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath88=\\frac{f_{zz}}{f_z}\\ , \\biggl(\\frac{f_{\\bar{z}}}{f_z}\\biggr)_{\\!z}{\\operatorname{d}}z\\wedge{\\operatorname{d}}\\bar{z}\\,,\\ ] ] which was the correct choice for the genus @xmath46 case . in this expression @xmath44",
    "should be a beltrami differential for @xmath71 , which is necessary for an invariant definition of the generating functional @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "this imposes strong conditions on the possible choices of the mapping @xmath32 .",
    "it should be noted in the first place that , contrary to the genus zero case , the correspondence @xmath89 is no longer one - to - one .",
    "indeed , the solution of the beltrami equation @xmath90 on @xmath70 depends on the extension of the beltrami coefficient @xmath22 to the lower half - plane @xmath91 of the complex plane @xmath14 .",
    "there are two canonical choices compatible with the action of @xmath71 . in the first case @xmath92 whereas",
    "in the second case @xmath93 in both cases , the property of @xmath22 being a beltrami differential for @xmath71 is equivalent to the following equivariance property of @xmath32 ( the solution of the beltrami equation in @xmath14 ) .",
    "there should exist an isomorphism @xmath94 , such that @xmath95 in the first case , the restriction of @xmath32 to @xmath70 yields a self - mapping of @xmath70 with @xmath96 a fuchsian group ( thus defining a fuchsian deformation of @xmath71 ) , whereas in the second case @xmath32 maps @xmath70 onto the interior of a simple jordan curve in @xmath14 with @xmath96 a quasi - fuchsian group ( thus defining a quasi - fuchsian deformation of @xmath71 ) .    however , using the equivariance property of @xmath32 it is easy to see that the `` naive '' expression can not be considered as a correct choice for the action functional in higher genus .",
    "indeed , it follows from that :    1 .",
    "[ ein ] the density @xmath97 $ ] is not a @xmath78-tensor for @xmath71 , so that the integral depends on any particular choice of the fundamental domain @xmath81 .",
    "[ zwei ] the formal variation of depends on the values of @xmath98 on the boundary @xmath99 of @xmath81 .",
    "one may try to overcome these difficulties and resolve the second problem by adding suitable `` correction terms '' to the functional ; these can be determined by performing the formal variation of .",
    "specifically , all local computations will be the same as in the genus zero case ( see lemma  [ set2 ] ) , except that now does not allow to get rid of the boundary terms in the stokes formula by setting the variations @xmath100 or @xmath98 to zero on @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , besides the local `` bulk '' term , the variation of will contain `` total derivative '' terms localized at @xmath99 .",
    "this suggests the addition of `` counterterms '' , which depend only on the edges of @xmath81 , such that their variation cancels the boundary terms coming from the variation of .",
    "such counterms can be determined ; it should be noted that a similar , though much simpler procedure was used in  @xcite , where the liouville action functional on the fundamental domain of a schottky group was defined . in our case , however , the actual construction goes one step further : the variation of the edge terms produces additional quantities localized at the vertices of @xmath99 . in turn",
    ", their cancellation requires counterterms that depend on the vertices of @xmath99 , which can be determined as well .",
    "it turns out that this rather complicated procedure , which solves problem  [ zwei ] , can be carried out in a canonical way using standard tools from homological algebra , namely various double complexes naturally associated with the riemann surface @xmath47 .",
    "it is remarkable that at the same time it solves problem  [ ein ] as well !    by using the action of the group @xmath71 on @xmath70 , we extend the singular chain boundary differential and the de  rham differential on @xmath101  to act on chains and cochains for the group homology and cohomology of @xmath71 . the corresponding group boundary and coboundary differentials give rise to two double complexes such that the fundamental domain @xmath81 and the density @xmath97 $ ] can be extended to representatives of suitable homology and cohomology classes @xmath102 $ ] and @xmath103 $ ] and the pairing between them becomes @xmath71-invariant .",
    "subsequently , we define the action functional @xmath58 $ ] as the result of such pairing , i.e. as the evaluation of @xmath103 $ ] on @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "quite naturally , the actual computation of these representatives goes exactly like descent calculations , familiar from brst cohomology ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this is more than a simple analogy in the following sense .",
    "the appropriate tool for linearizing the action of a discrete group is the group ring , which leads to the group ( co)homology that we are using for the action of the fuchsian group @xmath71 on @xmath70 .",
    "the corresponding concept in the case of a continuous ( lie ) group is the lie algebra and its ( co)homology , which is used in brst theory .",
    "the action functional @xmath58 $ ] resulting from this construction looks as follows .",
