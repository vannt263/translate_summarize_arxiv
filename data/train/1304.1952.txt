    "since its synthesis , graphene@xcite has attracted a lot of attention , both for its novel electronic properties and its possible applications .",
    "one of the most remarkable aspects is that the weak localization effect , which is a typical low - temperature phenomenon due to quantum corrections to the conductivity @xmath0 , can in graphene be observed up to a temperature range of 200 kelvin.@xcite it has been theoretically predicted that the sign of these corrections strongly depends on the kind of impurities in the graphene sample,@xcite so that both positive and negative magnetoconductivity , the so - called weak antilocalization effect , can be observed .",
    "this effect is well known to occur due to spin - orbit interaction , even though the latter is typically very weak in graphene . noting that the graphene lattice is composed of two sublattices",
    ", one can formulate the _",
    "_ degree of freedom as an _ isospin _ which is strongly coupled to the momentum .",
    "thereby , any elastic scattering that breaks the graphene sublattice symmetry is expected to result in weak antilocalization .",
    "this is made more complicated , however , by the fact that there is another discrete degree of freedom in graphene , the two degenerate dirac cones , which can correspondingly be formulated by introducing a _ pseudospin",
    "accordingly , any scattering which mixes these two valleys can result in yet another change of the sign of the quantum correction to the conductivity , and thereby to the restoration of weak localization .",
    "more recently , thermopower @xmath1 in graphene has been measured by several groups.@xcite the classical thermopower of graphene has been calculated with a range of different methods .",
    "the experiments show good agreement with the mott formula , which corresponds to the leading term of the sommerfeld expansion at low temperatures and large gate voltages.@xcite close to the dirac point , thermopower shows an unusual behavior , being linear in gate voltage , and changing sign .",
    "thus , while usually thermopower is expected to increase as the fermi energy , the electron density and thereby the conductivity are lowered , in graphene the thermopower becomes smaller as the dirac point is approached and the electron density and the conductivity are reduced .",
    "the main aims of this paper are , firstly , to find out if there are sizable quantum corrections to the thermopower @xmath2 in graphene and whether they are sensitive to weak magnetic fields , secondly , to present and analyze the combined analytical and numerical theory in order to provide the basis for a more quantitative analysis of experimental results on magnetoconductance of graphene .",
    "this will allow one to characterize samples , in particular the density , strength , and size of carrier scatterers , more accurately .",
    "we restrict our attention to the diffusion term of the thermopower and do not consider the phonon drag contribution , which becomes relevant only at high temperatures . in normal metals , the quantum corrections to the diffusion thermopower are known to be dominated by the weak localization corrections to the conductivity , yielding @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite thus , when the conductivity is reduced by the weak localization correction , the thermopower becomes enhanced .",
    "this is expected since the thermopower is known to increase from a metal towards an insulator .",
    "because of the particular electronic properties of graphene , where the sign of the quantum correction can change upon varying the gate voltage , it could be expected that these quantum corrections to thermopower are particularly large in graphene .",
    "we therefore determine the strength and the sign of the resulting _ magnetothermopower _ and analyze in detail how it changes with impurity parameters such as range , density , and strength and with the gate voltage .",

    "let us start with a brief review of the electronic properties of graphene , introducing the notation used in this article .",
    "we follow the convention of mccann and coworkers.@xcite for an overview and comparison of notations , see also , , and    graphene is a two - dimensional layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice .",
    "these carbon atoms are connected by strong @xmath5-bonds with their three neighboring atoms .",
    "the corresponding energy bands are filled valence bonds , lying deep below the fermi energy .",
    "the @xmath6-bond leads to the formation of a @xmath7band which is exactly half filled in ungated and undoped graphene .",
    "thus , to study transport properties we can restrict the model to this @xmath6-band .",
    "the basis of the bravais lattice consists of two atoms , each one of them forming one sublattice , named a- and b - sublattice .",
    "the electronic band structure shows two degenerate half filled cones , which in momentum space are located on the sites of the hexagonal reciprocal lattice .",
    "close to zero energy , the dirac points , the dispersion is in good approximation linear .",
    "each dirac cone is part of a sublattice , the k- and k-valleys .",
    "accordingly , the hamiltonian can be written as a @xmath8-matrix which , close to the dirac points in linear approximation , becomes @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the diagonal pauli matrix in k - k space , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are components of the momentum @xmath13 in the plane , and @xmath14 with @xmath15 the non - diagonal pauli matrices in the sublattice ( a , b)-space .",
    "the next correction term to the dispersion is quadratic and given by @xmath16 \\zeta_0,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the parameter of warping , which is given by@xcite @xmath18 in this notation the 4-component bloch - states are given by @xmath19 the hamiltonian can be more compactly written in the isospin and pseudospin notation , which is particularly convenient for the purpose of understanding the sign of weak localization corrections to the conductivity .",
    "following the definition of mccann and coauthors,@xcite we set @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the pauli matrices and @xmath24 the identity matrix in the sublattice ( a , b)-space , and @xmath25 , @xmath23 are the pauli matrices and @xmath26 the identity matrix in k - k space .",
    "the vector of the @xmath8 matrices @xmath27 is the _ isospin _ vector referring to the _ sublattice _",
    "( a , b ) degrees of freedom , and @xmath28 is the pseudospin vector referring to the valley ( k , k ) degrees of freedom .",
    "+ in this notation the hamiltonian @xmath29 can be written as @xmath30 note that @xmath31 is independent of the pseudospin @xmath32 , while the warping term @xmath33 breaks the pseudospin symmetry .",
    "disorder can have many different origins in graphene such as adatoms and vacancies , while substitutional defects are rather unlikely due to the strength of the @xmath5-bonding . for the purpose of the transport calculations ,",
    "it is rather convenient to classify the disorder according to whether it breaks the isospin symmetry ( a , b sublattices ) or the the pseudospin symmetry ( k , k valleys ) .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian of nonmagnetic disorder has in the representation of the pseudospin @xmath32 and the isospin @xmath34 the general form,@xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the identity matrix .",
    "@xmath37 is the part of the disorder potential which leaves both the isospin and the pseudospin symmetry invariant , while the other terms are breaking either of these symmetries with the amplitudes @xmath38 .",
    "we note that this disorder hamiltonian is invariant under time reversal , @xmath39 and @xmath40 and thus indeed describes nonmagnetic disorder .",
    "see appendix [ matrix ] for the explicit matrix representation of the hamiltonian .",
    "the corresponding scattering rates in born approximation are given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the density of states per spin and valley .",
    "we can thus define the total scattering rate as @xmath43    the intervalley scattering rate is obtained by summing over all matrix elements which couple to the transverse pseudo spin components @xmath44 and @xmath45 , yielding @xmath46 where we introduced @xmath47 to denote the transverse components , noting that @xmath48 and @xmath49 since @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    the intravalley scattering rate is accordingly given by @xmath52 the trigonal warping term in the kinetic energy of graphene results in an asymmetry of the dispersion at each valley with respect to momentum inversion,@xcite while the total hamiltonian including both valleys preserves that symmetry .",
    "therefore , the pseudospin is expected to precess in the presence of the warping term . in the presence of elastic scattering",
    "the pseudospin channels are expected to relax accordingly , as in motional narrowing , in proportion to the scattering time @xmath53 , @xmath54",
    "quantum corrections to the conductance , the so - called weak localization corrections , originate from the quantum interference of electrons propagating through the sample . on time scales @xmath55 exceeding the elastic mean free time @xmath53 , electrons move diffusively and their return probability can be enhanced due to the constructive interference of the amplitudes for propagation on closed diffusion paths , as long as that time @xmath55 does not exceed the phase coherence time @xmath56 . in the presence of spin - orbit interaction , the spin precesses as the electron moves on closed paths , and the phase of the amplitudes for clockwise and anticlockwise propagation no longer match , unless the total spin of these two propagations adds up to zero .",
    "this spin singlet channel leads to destructive interference , and thereby an enhancement of the conductance , the weak antilocalization correction .",
    "since the spin - orbit interaction in graphene is weak , in the absence of magnetic impurities , there are two independent spin channels in graphene and the quantum corrections are doubled due to this spin degeneracy . however , since the electron momentum @xmath57 is directly coupled to the isospin @xmath58 ( due to the a - b sublattice degree of freedom ) in the electron hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) , any momentum scattering will result in the breaking of the isospin symmetry .",
    "therefore , there is a finite contribution from the interference of two closed electron paths whose total isospin is zero , leading to weak antilocalization in the isospin singlet channel .",
    "let us now consider the influence of the pseudospin degree of freedom of the two valleys in graphene on the weak localization corrections . formulating the conductance corrections in the representation of pseudospin singlet and triplet modes , one has , in two dimensions , @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the diffusion constant , which in graphene is related to the elastic scattering time as @xmath61 , and the momentum integral has an upper cutoff @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the elastic mean free path .",
