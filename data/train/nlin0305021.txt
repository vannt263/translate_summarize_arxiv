    "in 1993 yuse and sano reported a simple experiment on fracture in glass @xcite that nevertheless has attracted great attention from the fracture community .",
    "the experiment examined a strip of glass pulled at constant velocity @xmath0 from an oven into water , cf .",
    "[ sketch ] . at small enough velocity nothing happens .",
    "a first critical velocity heralds the onset of a straight crack , whereas exceeding a second critical velocity results in an oscillatory crack .",
    "finally , at sufficiently high velocities the crack pattern exhibits multiple fractures and disorder .",
    "the reason for the high interest in this relatively simple experiment is of course that it offers a challenge for the theoretical description of fracture processes .",
    "being essentially a  quasi - static \" process , as the velocity @xmath0 is very much smaller than the rayleigh speed , the fracture process here is free of many of the complications arising in truly dynamic fracture @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the absence of a microscopic theory of the  process zone \" ( how materials actually break ) even the dynamics of quasi - static crack propagation in brittle materials remains a debatable issue .",
    "= 3.2 truecm    the lack of dynamical theory for the cracking process does not hinder the understanding of the onset of _ straight _ cracks in the above experiment .",
    "indeed , already in the year following the original experimental observations , marder has set up the equations describing the effect of the temperature field on the elastic theory of the material , and presented a qualitative description of the onset of straight cracks @xcite . from the quantitative point of view",
    "this treatment was lacking , in particular the fracture energy turned out to be strongly velocity dependent against physical intuition .",
    "the tools employed by marder did not allow however a correct prediction of the characteristics of the oscillatory crack propagation .",
    "the next decisive theoretical step was taken by adda - bedia and pomeau @xcite .",
    "these authors reproduced marder s results for straight cracks , but also developed a successful criterion for the secondary instability to oscillatory cracks .",
    "they employed the universal form of the near - tip stress tensor field , i.e. @xmath1 here @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the  stress intensity factors \" with respect to the opening and shear modes , whereas @xmath4 and @xmath5 are universal angular functions common to all configurations and loading conditions .",
    "adda - bedia and pomeau invoked the well - known and extensively used ",
    "principle of local symmetry \" , which states that the path taken by a crack in brittle homogeneous isotropic material is such that the local stress field at the tip of the crack is of mode i type , annulling @xmath3 .",
    "the considerations in @xcite led to the conclusion that the appearance of a negative @xmath3 for positive deviations from straight trajectory ( or positive @xmath3 for negative deviations ) was tantamount to the onset of the oscillatory instability .",
    "nevertheless these authors did not offer a careful quantitative comparison against the experiments knwon at the time .",
    "their prediction of the fracture energy and the wavelength of oscillations differed significantly from the experimental values .    in light of these results",
    ", we should explain at this point why do we feel that further theory is called for .",
    "first , we point out that  principle of local symmetry \" is hardly a dynamical theory .",
    "it can predict an instability , but taken literally would only agree with a fracture path that has sharp kinks .",
    "it can not be employed to predict the actual trajectory of a slowly moving crack when the latter is not straight .",
    "second , since the theoretical works cited above there have been additional experimental studies of this very same problem @xcite , offering a wealth of data to challenge the theory , a challenge that had not been picked up by the theorists .",
    "last , but not least , we feel that we can improve on a number of technical issues tackled by previous authors ; these will be spelled out in the sequel , hopefully gratifying the diligent reader as we go along .    from the conceptual point of view",
    "we offer a point of departure from previous treatments by adopting a _",
    "dynamical _ description of the crack development . in this",
    "we follow hodgdon and sethna @xcite who have built upon the principle of local symmetry , using standard theoretical methods , to reach a dynamical law for crack propagation which is given by @xmath6 + where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the tangent and the normal to the crack tip respectively , and @xmath9 is a material parameter that we assume to be nearly independent of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the quasi - static limit .",
    "this law predicts a _",
    "differentiable _ crack path such that @xmath3 is reduced .",
    "we will demonstrate that this law of motion provides us with predictions which are in excellent agreement with the characteristics of the crack trajectory in the oscillatory regime .",
    "we believe that this is the first context in which eqs .",
    "( [ dynamics ] ) are compared against a challenging set of experimental data ; the comparison appears quite favorable .    in sect .",
    "[ straight ] we discuss , facing the danger of being superfluous , the problem of the primary instability leading to a starting crack propagation once more .",
    "this instability had been correctly treated in @xcite , but we offer a technical improvement in the handling of the weiner - hopf factorization problem that is the basis of the solution . using recent mathematical advances @xcite we use pad approximants to significantly improve the treatment .",
    "since the results of this improved treatment are relied upon in our solution of the oscillatory instability , we present the theory for the straight crack in some detail .",
    "[ osci ] introduces the main novel results of our study in the context of the secondary instability to oscillatory cracks . using the dynamical law eq .",
    "( [ dynamics ] ) we show that as one crosses the second critical value of the parameters the solution of the equations changes its nature .",
    "we solve the equation near the onset of the oscillatory instability and calculate the critical values of the control parameters , the wavelength of oscillations and the material function @xmath10 .",
    "although our criterion for the oscillatory instability is in agreement with @xcite ( which was based on the  principle of local symmetry \" ) , we can go considerably further in describing the actual dynamics in the oscillatory regime .",
    "in particular we present a quantitative comparison with the experiments .",
    "our handling of the oscillatory instability includes also a technical improvement on the analysis of @xcite ; the latter needed a separate weiner - hopf problem for every order in the amplitude of the perturbation . in our calculation",
    "we derive a new expression for @xmath3 to leading order in the amplitude of the oscillations , an expression that requires a solution of only one wiener - hopf problem .",
    "this simplification is achieved by presenting a new way to decompose the straight crack problem into a singular and non - singular parts and then using a classical result of cotterell and rice @xcite .",
    "a crucial step in the calculation is the wiener - hopf factorization , for which we apply the new method of solution based on pad approximants @xcite . employing the dynamical law of crack - tip propagation we calculate the critical exponents for the transition and compare them with the experimental data .",
    "[ conclusion ] offers a summary and concluding remarks .",
    "by varying the experimental control parameters one varies the amount of elastic energy stored in the glass plate .",
    "one can choose various paths in parameter space ; in this work we adopt the scheme of @xcite , fixing the values of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath0 .",
    "the growth state depends then on the plate s width @xmath13 : for small enough values of the width a seeded crack does not grow ; for a width greater than a critical value @xmath14 , a crack , whose tip penetrates a length @xmath15 away from the cold bath , moves at a velocity @xmath16 .",
    "this crack is stationary in the laboratory frame of reference and is stable as long as the width is smaller than another critical value @xmath17 . above this value",
    "the crack becomes unstable and exhibits an oscillatory lateral motion with a well - defined amplitude and wavelength , still traveling at a velocity @xmath16 .",
    "as the width is further increased the propagation becomes less and less regular .",

    "for simplicity , we set the zero of the coordinates system at the cooling front level to avoid @xmath15 dependence which is unnecessary in the present context .",
    "for later calculations we will use the aforementioned transformation to put back the @xmath15 dependence .    in the frame of reference of the plate the temperature field obeys the heat equation + @xmath45 + with the boundary conditions @xmath46",
    "here @xmath47 is the diffusion coefficient of the glass , h is the distance between the cold bath and the heater and @xmath48 is the unit vector normal to the boundary of the domain .",
    "this equation can be simplified for the straight crack configuration , for which there is no @xmath23 dependence , by looking for a stationary solution in the laboratory frame of reference , of the form @xmath49 .",

    "note that we assumed that the temperature is uniform along this dimension and therefore the breakdown of this assumption in this regime leads to a three - dimensional problem , which is outside the scope of our two - dimensional model .",
    "the temperature field enters the problem through the term @xmath54 of the inhomogeneous bi - laplace equation .",
    "this term is sensitive only to variations of the temperature gradient , i.e. to the curvature of the thermal field . in eq .",
    "( [ tempfield ] ) we considered a finite spatial separation between the thermal baths , but assumed perfect thermal baths , an assumption that leads to a discontinuity of the gradient near the baths .",
    "this discontinuity results in incorrect estimates of the stress field ; since at low velocities ( see fig .",
    "2 ) the only gradient variations are in these regions , we can not expect a very good quantitative agreement with the experiment for low velocities . at higher velocities ,",
    "there is a significant curvature inside the glass , so we expect a better quantitative agreement with the experiment . in @xcite the temperature field was measured and found to vary smoothly near the baths due to the finite impedances of the baths . in the absence of the experimental data of the measured temperature field",
    "we will use the ideal baths approximation .",
    "the crucial element in the solution is the wiener - hopf factorization of the known kernel @xmath55 .",
    "generally it is not possible to find an _ exact _ factorization , so one tries an approximant @xmath56 that can be exactly factorized .",
    "this can be made rigorous following a recently proven theorem @xcite which establishes the closeness of the product factors of @xmath57 to those of @xmath55 in their region of regularity if @xmath58 for all @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the strip of analyticity of @xmath55 .",
    "a commonly followed first step in finding @xmath61 is to examine the behavior of @xmath62 near zero and @xmath63 + @xmath64 @xmath65 + a standard approach to finding a good factorization is then to seek a function @xmath66 that reproduces the asymptotic behavior of @xmath62 and to correct it by a ratio of two polynomials @xmath67 where for example @xmath68 and @xmath69 are free parameters that should be chosen as to best fit @xmath57 to @xmath55 . in principle , one can use higher order polynomial ratio to achieve greater accuracy .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that the positions of the poles and zeros are not well - controlled and that the convergence behavior of the process is not clear .    in our work",

    "let us take the expansion point to be @xmath75 , so @xmath76 where @xmath77 are known .",
    "in order to solve for the unknown coefficients one should set @xmath78 + to obtain a set of linear equations @xcite . in this method one",

    "note that since in practice one uses the truncated series of @xmath55 it is not possible to approximate directly the product factors for arbitrary large @xmath79 . in order to overcome this difficulty we should find the asymptotic form of the factorization and use it as a boundary condition for the pad approximants .",
    "the asymptotic factorization is found by noticing that the zeros and poles of @xmath62 , which are respectively the solutions of the equations + @xmath80 @xmath81 have the property that if , for example , @xmath82 is a zero of @xmath62 then @xmath83 are also zeros .",

    "this value should be compared to fig . 5 in ref .",
    "solving a dynamic fracture problem in the quasi - static limit consists of ( i ) solving the equilibrium equations for the stress field together with a given set of boundary conditions at the sample boundaries and on the ( a - priori unknown and evolving ) crack boundary and ( ii ) employing a dynamical principle to evolve the crack .",

    "we learn that also the last term is a pure sine function , since it has to vanish at the critical point exactly like the @xmath188 term .",
    "the main point of departure of our theory from previous ones is that we employ , in addition to the two - dimensional linear elasticity part , the dynamical crack - tip propagation law suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . using this dynamical law",
    "we first derived a stability criterion for the straight crack propagation which is identical to a previously suggested criterion @xcite .",
    "we then extended the analysis to the evolution of the crack shape just above the onset of the oscillatory instability and showed that the dynamical equation has a stationary sinusoidal solution with a theoretically calculated wavenumber .",

    "finally , we showed how the dynamical tip propagation law translates to an amplitude equation for the oscillatory solution .",
    "this equation resulted in calculated critical exponents of the transition , in agreement with the measured ones .",
    "the success of the dynamical theory based on the law of tip propagation lends strong support to this law , at least in these quasi - static conditions .",
    "one should stress at this point that the analysis considered the temperature field as effectively frozen .",
    "the oscillatory nature of the crack has very little to do with the temperature dynamics .",
    "this can not be expected to remain valid for larger amplitudes of oscillations since the boundary condition restrict the temperature level sets to be normal to the crack .",
    "thus at some point the dynamics of the termperature field must enter the discussion , potentially leading to new dynamic instabilities including chaos and disorder .",
    "in fact , the conclusion of this study appears to be that in the quasi - static conditions the assumption of small scale yielding holds , making it sufficient to solve the linear elasticity problem , coupled to a correct law of motion that dictates how the tip propagates .",
    "it would be interesting to try to apply this or similar laws to other contexts in which the quasi - static problem can be solved , but where the absence of an accepted propagation law has led to a number of possible evolutions @xcite .",
    "we expect however that in truly dynamical crack propagation new theoretical concepts need to be developed in order to reach a similar level of calculation of experimental observations .",
