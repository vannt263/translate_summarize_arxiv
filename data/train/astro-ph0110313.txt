    "the absence of the hydrogen gunn - peterson trough in quasar absorption spectra ( @xcite ) strongly indicates that the smoothly distributed hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is already highly ionized by @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , becker et al . ( 2001 ) reported the first detection of the gunn - peterson test through in a @xmath11 qso spectrum .",
    "however , even a small fraction of neutral hydrogen in the igm would result in an undetectable flux because of the large cross section to ly@xmath12 photons , and thus further careful investigations will be necessary .",
    "these results also imply the presence of very luminous ionizing sources such as qsos and high mass stars at high redshifts to cause photoionizations of hydrogen by @xmath13 . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that earlier reionization would have brought the last scattering surface to lower redshift , smoothing the intrinsic anisotropies in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation generated at the recombination epoch @xmath14 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the recent measurements of the cmb anisotropies on subdegree angular scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) can be used to set an upper limit on reionization redshift such as @xmath15 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , under the currently favored adiabatic cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario for the structure formation , reionization of the universe is expected to occur in the range of @xmath16 . revealing how reionization proceeds in the inhomogeneous universe stands out as one of the most important problems in the observational cosmology",
    "( e.g. , see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "secondary cmb anisotropies should be induced by scattering of cmb photons off electrons in the ionized medium undergoing bulk motion in the large - scale structure .",
    "it is therefore expected that the secondary anisotropies can provide a laboratory for studying structure formation in the reionized epoch .",
    "kaiser ( 1984 ) investigated the cmb distortion induced by the bulk velocity to pure linear order of @xmath3 and found that the induced anisotropies are small at arcminite scales resulting from cancellations between positive and negative shifts along the line of sight , since the gravitationally induced bulk velocities are irrotational .",
    "ostriker & vishniac ( 1986 ) then pointed out that the coupling of the doppler effect with spatial variations in the free electron density produces @xmath17 anisotropies on arcminite scales at the order of @xmath18 , which is the so - called ostriker - vishniac ( ov ) effect , because the effect is a second - order contribution of perturbations that does not suffer from the cancellation ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . for",
    "the same reason , spatial inhomogeneities of ionization fraction associated with a realistic patchy reionization scenario should lead to the secondary cmb anisotropies by the doppler effect ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , benson et al . ( 2001 ) investigated the secondary cmb fluctuations under a realistic model of the reionization of igm caused by starts in high - redshift galaxies , based on a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation and a high - resolution n - body simulation of the dark matter clustering .",
    "they showed that measurements of cmb anisotropies could actually put stringent constraints on the reionization processes . on the other hand , from theoretical aspects ,",
    "it is not so evident to answer the problem which second - order effect of perturbations produces dominant contribution to the secondary cmb fluctuations .",
    "hu , scott , & silk ( 1994 hereafter hss ; see also dodelson & jubas 1995 ) derived a complete boltzmann equation including the quadratic doppler effects @xmath19 of bulk velocity that governs redshift evolution of the cmb temperature fluctuation field . consequently , they found that , although the quadratic doppler effect should induce spectral distortion of cmb like the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect ( @xcite ) as a new qualitative feature , the magnitude is always smaller than that of the ov effect for the cdm models .    a great uncertainty in models for structure formation in the reionized epoch is the extent and nature of reionization , because this requires the understanding of various complicated astrophysical processes such as the nature of first ionizing sources , the fraction of ionizing photons that escape the sources to become available for photoionization of the hydrogen in igm , and the radiative balance between the escaped emissivity and the recombination rate in the inhomogeneous igm .",
    "for example , even a naive question which high - density or low - density region in the large - scale structure becomes first photoionized bas not still been answered definitely .",
    "assuming _ ab initio _ that the distribution of the ionization fraction is given as a function of gas density , miralde - escud , hanehnelt , & rees ( 2000 ; hereafter mhr ) suggested that the uv radiation may escape into and ionize the low - density region , where the recombination rates are the lowest , even though it is expected that the ionizing sources could be associated with the peaks in the density field .",
    "this conclusion has also been confirmed by the recent numerical simulations taking into account the radiative transfer approximately ( @xcite ) .",
    "while the relation between the dark matter and ionized medium distributions is thus a crucial clue to understanding the reionization history connected with the gravitational instability scenario of structure formation , the relation seems difficult to be directly observed by methods so far proposed .",
    "therefore , the purpose of this paper is to investigate the cross - correlation between the dark matter distribution and the secondary cmb temperature fluctuation field induced by the ionized medium in the mildly nonlinear structure .",
    "it is now recognized that the weak gravitational lensing effect due to the large - scale structure can be a unique tool to observationally reconstruct the dark matter distribution ( e.g. , see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "there are two feasible methods often considered in the literature ; one is using the distortion effects on distant galaxy images that have been actually detected ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the other is using the weak lensing effects on the cmb map ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , b ) .",
    "in particular , it is expected that the method of using the distortion effects on the cmb map developed by seljak & zaldarriaga ( 1999 ; also @xcite ) allows us to reconstruct the projected dark matter distribution with high accuracy .",
    "based on these considerations , in this paper we assume that the weak lensing field is _ a priori _ reconstructed by those methods , for example , using the future cmb data from the satellite mission _",
    "planck surveyor_. then , taking a cross - correlation between the weak lensing field and the cmb map including the secondary fluctuations would be a challenging test .",
    "furthermore , the cross - correlation method could improve the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of the doppler effect compared with the original s / n in the cmb map itself if the secondary cmb field correlates with the weak lensing field , which is analogous to , for example , the cross - correlation between the cmb temperature fluctuation and polarization fields ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite for other examples ) . in this paper , based on the small angle approximation",
    ", we first develop a formalism for calculating the cross - correlation function and its angular power spectrum between the weak lensing field and the secondary cmb fluctuation field including the doppler effects up to the second - order of the bulk velocity field .",
    "we then estimate the magnitude of the cross - correlation under the currently favored cdm models and the simplest assumption of homogeneous reionization history after some epoch @xmath20 .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in  [ prel ] we review the relevant properties and parameters of the adiabatic cdm scenario for structure formation . in ",

    "we present the discussions and conclusions . throughout this paper , we employ unit of @xmath21 for light speed @xmath22 .",
    "the expansion rate of the universe can be described by the friedmann equation : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the scale factor , @xmath25 is the hubble constant , @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the density parameters of the present - day non - relativistic matter and the contribution of the cosmological constant relative to the critical density @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "here we have set @xmath29 at present for convenience . throughout this paper , we consider only a flat universe model as supported by the recent high precision cmb experiments ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and then we have @xmath30 . the conformal time which we will often use in the following discussions",
    "is defined by @xmath31 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the comoving angular diameter distance @xmath32 with respect to @xmath33 or equivalently redshift @xmath34 , and for a flat universe model it is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the present conformal time and @xmath34 is given by @xmath37 .",
    "it is currently believed that the reionization of the universe occurred at @xmath16 such that the reionized medium is optically thin to the thomson scattering of cmb photons , which is characterized as @xmath38 in terms of the optical depth , @xmath39 .",

    "we fix @xmath49 throughout this paper .    again in the case of homogeneous and full hydrogen ionization , the visibility function that gives the probability of last scattering within @xmath50 of @xmath33 is expressed as @xmath51 where overdot denotes derivative with respect to the conformal time @xmath33 .",
    "the evolution of the large - scale structure after the decoupling epoch @xmath52 is characterized by the time evolution and scale dependence of the density contrast field @xmath53 mainly caused by the dark matter distribution .",
    "the gravitational instability then leads to bulk motions of structure with the velocity field @xmath54 , and we expect that the ionized baryonic medium also follows the bulk motion on large scales , leading to the doppler effects on cmb photons through the compton scattering by electrons .",
    "since we focus our investigations on the secondary cmb fluctuations up to the second - order of @xmath2 , we need to consider the fields of @xmath55 and @xmath56 up to the second - order that are valid in the mildly nonlinear regime such as @xmath57 : @xmath58 the quantities with superscripts ` ( 1 ) ' and ` ( 2 ) ' denote the first- and second - order perturbation quantities , respectively .",
    "the time dependences of these fields can be expressed in terms of cosmological parameters based on the ( eulerian ) perturbation theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the linear regime ,",
    "the time dependence of @xmath59 is given by the growing factor as @xmath60 with @xmath61 where we have neglected the radiation energy contribution , and will normalize @xmath62 at the present time @xmath63 for convenience in the followings .",
    "the fourier transformation of @xmath64 is expressed as @xmath65 if the linear density fluctuations are gaussian , the statistical properties can be completely specified by the power spectrum @xmath66 defined by @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes an ensemble average over all realizations .",
    "note that time evolution of the power spectrum is given by @xmath69 .",
    "in this paper , assuming the adiabatic cdm scenario , we employ the harrison - zeldovich spectrum and the bbks transfer function ( @xcite ) with the shape parameter given by sugiyama ( 1995 ) as for the shape of @xmath66 .",
    "the free parameter is then the normalization of @xmath66 only , which is conventionally expressed in terms of the rms mass fluctuations of a sphere of @xmath70mpc radius , i.e. , @xmath71 . from the continuity equation",
    ", we can obtain the fourier components of the bulk velocity filed @xmath72 at the first order as @xmath73 likewise , based on the perturbation theory , we can obtain the second - order fourier components of density fluctuation and bulk velocity fields in terms of @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( e.g. , see @xcite ) : @xmath76 with @xmath77 where we have neglected extremely weak dependences of the functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 on cosmological parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 for simplicity , and considered the scalar type perturbations only .",
    "it is worth noting that , even if perturbations start from gaussian in the linear regime , the mildly nonlinear evolution leads to non - vanishing third - order moments such as @xmath80 and @xmath81 , because those quantities are essentially the fourth - order moments of linear perturbation quantities like @xmath82 .",
    "here , following hss , we briefly review the derivation of the secondary cmb temperature fluctuation field induced by the doppler effect of ionized medium up to the second order @xmath19 of the bulk velocity .",
    "let us first write down the boltzmann equation in terms of the cmb photon energy @xmath83 and direction @xmath84 in the presence of compton scattering between the cmb photons and free electrons that could lead to energy changes ; @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the photon occupation number and @xmath87 is the collision term by the compton scattering .",

    "the other terms give the quadratic doppler effect of @xmath19 .",
    "it is interesting that the effect leads to energy exchanges between cmb photons and electrons like the thermal sz effect , and therefore causes the compton @xmath90-distortion . as shown by hss",
    ", we can get more physical insight into this effect by considering the limit of many scattering blobs or equivalently the multiple scattering limit .",
    "if we can average equation ( [ eqn : collision ] ) over the direction of bulk velocity field @xmath56 , the @xmath3 doppler effect primarily cancels in this case and then we can obtain @xmath91 .",
    "\\label{eqn : manyblob}\\ ] ] if introducing the effective temperature @xmath92 defined by @xmath93 ( @xmath94 is the electron mass ) , this collision term reduces to the same form of that in the kompaneets equation with the thermal temperature @xmath95 of hot electron , which gives the thermal sz effect .",
    "this implies that many ionized blobs distributed in the large - scale structure can be considered like hot electrons inside one cluster , and thus those blobs induce the energy exchange to the cmb photons characterized by the effective temperature @xmath92 . under the cdm scenario for the structure formation",
    ", the amplitude of compton @xmath90-distortion induced by the quadratic doppler effect is below that due to the thermal sz effect mainly caused by intracluster hot plasma .",
    "this is because we can typically estimate @xmath96 for the gravitationally induced bulk flow and @xmath97 for intracluster hot plasma , and the fact of @xmath98 leads to the conclusion , even though clusters are rare objects in the universe . in this paper",
    ", we do not employ the many scattering blobs limit for the purpose of generality as done by hss .",
    "namely , we shall no longer be concerned with frequency dependence of the temperature fluctuation field .",

    "it is thus clear that @xmath9 is different from @xmath113 in a general reionization history .",
    "note that we will deal with @xmath9 throughout this paper .",
    "in this section , we develop a formalism for calculating the cross - correlation function and its angular power spectrum between the weak lensing field and the secondary cmb anisotropies field induced by the doppler effect of the ionized medium .",
    "the weak gravitational lensing due to the large - scale structure is now recognized as a unique tool for directly measuring the dark matter distribution .",
    "seljak & zaldarriaga ( 1999 ) ( also see @xcite ) developed a useful method for reconstructing the projected field of dark matter fluctuations between the last scattering surface and present from the lensing distortions to the product of gradients of the temperature filed .",
    "this method could be successfully performed by the satellite mission planck .",
    "it has been also shown that a new power of temperature fluctuations generated by the weak lensing effect on arcminute scales below the silk damping scale can be directly used to reconstruct the projected dark matter field , provided that we have data with arcminute - scale spatial resolution and sensitivity of @xmath114 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and we can remove other secondary signals such as the sz effect by taking advantage of the specific spectral properties or by combining the cmb measurement with the @xmath115-ray or the sz effect itself . furthermore ,",
    "if measurements of the cmb polarization become possible , combinations of the lensing effects on the temperature fluctuation and the @xmath116- and @xmath117-type polarization fields can improve the reconstruction ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is because the lensing effect induces the @xmath117-type polarization on the observed sky from the non - linear coupling to the primary @xmath116-mode , evin if the primary cmb contains the @xmath116-mode only as suggested by starndard inflationary scenarios , and there is negligible cosmological contamination of the polarization field in the arcminute regime unlike the temperature fluctuations ( @xcite ) .    the projected dark matter field",
    "is called the convergence field , @xmath0 , and can be expressed in the form of a weighted projection of the three - dimensional density fluctuation field along the line of sight ; @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the lensing weight function defined by @xmath120 on the other hand , the lensing distortion effect on distant galaxy images can be similarly used to measure the relatively low redshift dark matter distribution such as @xmath121 , depending on typical redshift of source galaxies ( @xcite ) . in this case , the lower limit in the integration ( [ eqn : conv ] ) becomes the conformal time corresponding to the redshift of source galaxies @xmath122 .",
    "however , we should bear in mind that the lensing effect on galaxies is relatively irrelevant for the purpose of this paper , because this method usually restricts the convergence field to low redshifts ( e.g. see @xcite ) , while the reionization signal in the cmb map is imprinted at moderate and high redshifts .",
    "the weak lensing effects on cmb thus has a great advantage of probing the dark matter distribution up to high redshift , which can not be attained by any other means ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the convergence field @xmath123 with respect to direction @xmath100 is _ a prior _ reconstructed from measurements of the lensing effects on cmb .      from equation ( [ eqn : fullcmb2nd ] )",
    ", the secondary temperature fluctuation field induced by the @xmath3 doppler effect can be written as @xmath124 the pure linear order doppler effect , @xmath125 , is suppressed on small scales because the gravitational instability generates irrotational flow , leading to cancellations between positive and negative doppler shifts along the line of sight ( @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , leading contribution to the secondary temperature fluctuations due to the doppler effect comes from second order perturbations that do not suffer from the cancellation like the ov effect of @xmath89 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the patchy ionization effect of @xmath126 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , where @xmath112 is the spatial inhomogeneities of ionization fraction @xmath127 as discussed below equation ( [ eqn : elenum ] ) .    from equations",

    "however , it is clear that , since those moments has linear dependence on the bulk velocity field @xmath56 , the cross - correlation is suppressed on relevant small angular scales because of the cancellations between positive and negative contributions from the bulk velocity field for the ensemble average .",
    "note that the two - point correlation function of the ov effect or equivalently its angular power spectrum arises from the quadratic contribution of the velocity field as @xmath130 , whereas it does not suffer from the cancellation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we next consider secondary temperature fluctuations induced by the quadratic doppler effect of the bulk velocity . in the case of assuming the homogeneous ionization history ,",
    "the secondary fluctuations are divided into two contributions ; the doppler effect of @xmath19 and the density - modulated effect of @xmath131 . as will be shown later",
    ", the effect of @xmath131 generally produces dominant contribution on small angular scales @xmath6 , where the nonlinear structures with @xmath132 are important . from equation ( [ eqn : fullcmb2nd ] )",

    "half the contribution to @xmath135 comes from scales @xmath136 , and the density fluctuations go nonlinear at @xmath137 .",
    "this is the reason that the secondary cmb anisotropies by the doppler effects of @xmath19 and @xmath131 are the order of magnitude smaller than the anisotropies by the ov effect of @xmath89 on relevant angular scales .",
    "however , from the fact that there is no cross - correlation between the convergence field and the ov effect , the quadratic doppler effects can provide primary contribution to the cross - correlation between the convergence field and the secondary cmb temperature fluctuations induced by the ionized medium .    since we are interested in the cross - correlation on small angular scales such as @xmath138 , it is useful to employ the small angle approximation originally developed by bond & efstathiou ( 1987 ) . in this case ,",

    ", we can accurately predict the magnitude of the integrand quantity once we fix the dark matter power spectrum such as the cdm model and the cosmological parameters , which will be well constrained in the near future by other observations such as measurements of the cmb anisotropies , the weak lensing survey and so on . we therefore expect that measurements of @xmath153 can set precise constraints on the average ionization fraction @xmath160 between the reionization epoch and present .",
    "next , we consider the secondary temperature fluctuation field induced by the density - modulated quadratic doppler effect of @xmath189 . from equation ( [ eqn : fullcmb2nd",
    "] ) we have @xmath190.\\ ] ] in the following , to relate @xmath9 to the dark matter fluctuation field @xmath55 , we introduce the linear biasing parameter @xmath191 expressed as @xmath192 for simplicity .",
    "note that @xmath191 generally depends on time and spatial position .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to calculate the cross - correlation function between the convergence field and the temperature fluctuations field @xmath193 : @xmath194(\\eta',{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$}}_b)}\\right\\rangle}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx & { \\langle{x_e b}\\rangle}\\int\\!\\!d\\eta \\int\\!\\!d\\eta ' w(\\eta,\\eta_\\ast)g(\\eta ' ) { \\left\\langle{\\delta(\\eta,{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$}}_a)[\\delta\\left\\{-v^2 + 7({\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\gamma$}}_b\\cdot { \\mbox{\\boldmath$v$}})^2\\right\\}](\\eta',{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$}}_b)}\\right\\rangle } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & { \\langle{x_eb}\\rangle}\\int\\!\\!d\\eta \\int\\!\\!d\\eta ' w(\\eta,\\eta_\\ast)g(\\eta ' ) { \\langle{\\delta\\delta}\\rangle}{\\langle{-v^2 + 7({\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\gamma$}}_b\\cdot{\\mbox{\\boldmath$v$}})^2}\\rangle}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & { \\langle{x_eb}\\rangle}\\int\\!\\!d\\eta \\int\\!\\!d\\eta ' w(\\eta,\\eta_\\ast)g(\\eta ' ) { \\langle{\\delta(\\eta,{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$}}_a)\\delta(\\eta',{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$}}_b)}\\rangle } \\frac{4}{3}{\\langle{v^2}\\rangle},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath195 is the average quantity of @xmath196 between the reionization epoch and present . after the similar procedure as used in the derivation of equation ( [ eqn : clbis ] ) , we can obtain the angular power spectrum @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the rms of the present - day bulk velocity field and",
    "can be expressed in terms of the linear density power spectrum as @xmath199 here the factor @xmath200 is due to the three - dimensional freedom of bulk velocity field such that @xmath198 represents the rms of one - dimensional motion .",
    "the most important result of equation ( [ eqn : cldens ] ) is that the angular power spectrum @xmath201 is proportional to not quadratic but linear term of @xmath195 for all @xmath202 and therefore could be both positive and negative , depending on the sign of @xmath195 or more specifically on the sing of @xmath203 , since the integrand quantity in equation ( [ eqn : cldens ] ) is always positive .",
    "the quantity @xmath195 should be a crucial clue to understanding of how the ionized medium distribution is related to the dark matter distribution in the large - scale structure , which still remains large uncertainties both from theoretical and observational aspects . the measurements of @xmath201 can thus be a new direct probe of revealing the projected biasing relation .",
    "it is worth noting that the angular power spectrum of the ov effect depends on the quadratic term @xmath204 and is always positive irrespective of the sing of @xmath205 .",
    "the simple assumption that the ionized medium traces the dark matter distribution allows us to place the upper limit on @xmath206 using the nonlinear dark matter power spectrum , which has been well studied with n - body simulations for the full range of adiabatic cdm models .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : cldens ] ) can be then rewritten as @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the power spectrum of nonlinear density fluctuations for which we will employ the fitting formula developed by peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) . note that we here consider a possible case that electrons in reionized medium with non - linear density fluctuations are distributed along the line of sight moving according to a large - scale coherent bulk velocity field , as suggested by the cdm power spectrum .",
    "this is in fact an essential mechanism that the ostriker - vishniac effect can avoid cancellations between blue- and red shifts along the line of sight from the coupling of the density and velocity fields .",
    "based on this consideration , in figure [ fig : cl_nl ] we use the non - linear power spectrum only for the calculation of @xmath201 and use the second - order perturbation theory for that of @xmath153 , because the latter arises from the ensemble average of the density fluctuation field and the bulk velocity filed on the mildly non - linear regime .",
    "we present numerical results for the angular power spectra given by equations ( [ eqn : clbis ] ) and ( [ eqn : cldens ] ) for the @xmath134cdm model .",
    "we adopt a set of cosmological parameters of @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 , and @xmath213 , which is consistent with the recent cmb experiments ( @xcite ) and the cluster abundance ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we simply consider the homogeneous hydrogen ionization model after a given reionization epoch in the range of @xmath214 . in this case",
    "we will consider @xmath215 with respect to time during @xmath216 and equations ( [ eqn : opt ] ) and ( [ eqn : visib ] ) can be used for calculations of the optical depth and visibility function , respectively . although more realistic model is a patchy or inhomogeneous reionization ( e.g. , @xcite ) , our model allows us to compute the magnitude of effects in the simplest way .",
    "we first estimate the order of magnitude of secondary temperature fluctuations by the quadratic doppler effect . using the @xmath134cdm model above",
    ", the present - day rms of bulk velocity field can be estimated from equation ( [ eqn : rmsvel ] ) as @xmath217 in the unit of @xmath21 .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : fullcmb2nd ] ) tells us that the magnitude of temperature fluctuations induced by the quadratic doppler effect can be roughly estimated as @xmath218 for @xmath219 , since we have @xmath220 for the model considered in this paper .",
    "similarly , the magnitude of temperature fluctuations induced by the ov effect can be estimated as @xmath221 , which is consistent with the numerical results done by hu & white ( 1996 ) ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we thus conclude @xmath222 in the observed cmb map itself , and the magnitude of @xmath143 is much below sensitivities of the satellite missions _",
    "map _ and _ planck surveyor_.    figure [ fig : cl ] shows the angular power spectra of the cross - correlations between the weak lensing field and the secondary temperature fluctuations induced by the quadratic doppler effect of @xmath19 ( dashed lines ) and the density - modulated effect of @xmath223 ( solid ) , which are computed using equations ( [ eqn : clbis ] ) and ( [ eqn : cldens ] ) , respectively .",
    "we here assumed @xmath224 for the unknown biasing parameter between the dark matter and electron distributions in the large - scale structure .",
    "both the magnitudes of the doppler effects of @xmath19 and @xmath8 are comparable on @xmath225 in the case of no biasing @xmath224 .",
    "this is because leading contribution to the cross - correlation between the weak lensing field of @xmath226 and the doppler effect of @xmath19 comes from the fourth - order moments of linear perturbations like @xmath227 resulting from the vanishing of the third - order moments @xmath228 , while the cross - correlation from the density - modulated doppler effect of @xmath8 also arises from the moments of @xmath229 .",
    "it is clear that the contribution from the density - modulated effect of @xmath131 dominates the effect of @xmath19 on angular scales of @xmath138 .",
    "the total magnitudes of the angular power spectra peak @xmath230 around @xmath231 for the @xmath134cdm model and for the five cases of reionization epoch @xmath232 .",
    "the peak location in @xmath202-space results from the shape of cdm power spectrum .",
    "on the other hand , cooray ( 2000 ) investigated the angular power spectrum of the cross - correlation between the weak lensing field and the thermal sz temperature fluctuation field based on the halo approach of dark matter clustering ( @xcite ) and the simple model of intracluster gas distribution .",
    "the magnitude of the angular power spectrum from the sz effect amounts to @xmath233 at @xmath234 for the similar models as considered in this paper .",
    "the temperature fluctuation induced by the quadratic doppler effect is over an order of magnitude smaller than that by the sz effect because of @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "from this fact , it seems unlikely that the magnitude of the cross - correlation between @xmath0 and the quadratic doppler effect is smaller only by @xmath237 than that from the sz effect .",
    "this is because the cross - correlation with the doppler effect comes from wide - range redshift structures such as @xmath238 , while the sz effect has dominant contributions from low redshift massive dark halos such as clusters of galaxies with @xmath239 at @xmath240 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these results therefore imply that , if the weak lensing field is _ a priori _ reconstructed by measurements of lensing effects on the cmb , the cross - correlation could improve the s / n of the quadratic doppler effect , even though the angular power spectrum itself of the doppler effect has a small power of @xmath241 only .",
    "this is an analogous statement to the cross - correlation between the primary cmb temperature fluctuation and polarization fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to explicitly illustrate how the cross - correlation considered could be useful to reveal the biasing relation between the dark matter and electron distributions , we here employ a toy model of the antibiasing relation , motivated by the reionization scenario of low - density region prior to the high - density region as suggested by mhr .",
    "the homogeneous full hydrogen ionization with @xmath242 seems to lead to @xmath243 from @xmath244 , which seems inconsistent with the antibiasing relation , and thus we here assume the partly homogeneous ionization fraction of @xmath245 after @xmath163 .",
    "although the antibiasing process depends on how reionization proceeds in the large - scale structure in detail , we consider the simplest model of linear and constant antibiasing relation given by @xmath246 with @xmath247 .",
    "it should be then noted that the condition of @xmath248 leads to @xmath249 .",
    "accordingly , we have taken into account the range of @xmath55 for the calculation of the ensemble average of @xmath250 used in equation ( [ eqn : cldens ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : antibias ] shows the result of this toy model , and one can readily see that we should observe the negative total angular power spectra ( solid lines ) of the cross - correlation between the weak lensing field and the secondary temperature fluctuation field induced by the doppler effect on @xmath251 .",
    "note that this critical scale of @xmath202 depends on the value of the antibiasing parameter @xmath191 , because the cancellation between the spectra from the quadratic doppler effect of @xmath19 and the density - modulated effect of @xmath131 also depends on @xmath191 .",
    "as expected , the cross - correlation function could thus be a direct probe of the antibiasing relation , which can not be attained by measurements of the angular power spectrum of the @xmath252 doppler effect such as the ov effect because of the quadratic dependence on the biasing relation .",
    "figure [ fig : cl_nl ] shows the maximal estimate of the angular power spectrum of the cross - correlation using the nonlinear dark matter power spectrum under the simplest assumption that the gas traces dark matter distribution in the large - scale structure .",
    "we here again considered the simplest model of @xmath242 and @xmath224 as in figure [ fig : cl ] .",
    "the nonlinear enhancement could be important on small angular scales of @xmath253 .",
    "however , it is not still clear if the electron distribution traces dark matter distribution in the nonlinear regime , because physical processes of the gas pressure and radiative dynamics should also play an important role in such nonlinear regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for this reason , the curves in figure [ fig : cl_nl ] provide us with upper limits on a realistic angular power spectrum of the cross - correlation",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the cross - correlation between the weak lensing field and the secondary cmb temperature fluctuations induced by the doppler effect of the ionized medium in the reionized epoch of the universe .",
    "the main result of this paper is to develop a formalism for calculating the cross - correlation function and its angular power spectrum based on the small angle approximation .",
    "the leading order to the cross - correlation comes from the secondary cmb anisotropies due to the quadratic doppler effects of the bulk motions , since the cross - correlation with the @xmath3 doppler effect such as the ov effect depends linearly on the bulk velocity field and thus suffers from cancellations between positive and negative contributions from the bulk velocity field for the ensemble average .",
    "there are two main contributions to the cross - correlation function : one is contribution from the pure quadratic doppler effect of @xmath19 and the other is that from the density - modulated effect of @xmath131 , where @xmath9 is the electron density fluctuation field . for the cdm models , the latter contribution dominates the former on angular scales of @xmath138 if the ionized medium traces the dark matter distribution .",
    "we found that the cross - correlation of @xmath254 from the doppler effect of @xmath19 is sensitive to the average ionization fraction @xmath160 between the reionization epoch and present in the sense that the bulk velocity and the weak lensing field depends only on the dark matter fluctuations , through the gravitational instability scenario , and on the cosmological parameters , which will be well constrained by the future precise data such as the primary cmb anisotropies and the weak lensing survey . on the other hand",
    ", we showed that the cross - correlation of @xmath255 between the weak lensing field and the density - modulated quadratic doppler effect of @xmath131 depends linearly on the biasing relation between the dark matter and free electron distributions , and therefore its angular power spectrum could be both positive and negative , depending on the biasing and antibiasing , respectively .",
    "if the low density region of igm is ionized prior to the high density region in the reionization history as suggested by mhr ( see also @xcite ) , we would measure the negative angular spectrum of the cross - correlation .",
    "our results thus offer a new opportunity to understand the unknown problem how reionization proceeds in the inhomogeneous intergalactic medium connected to the dark matter clustering in principle , although the magnitude of the signal is very small .",
    "let us briefly comment on other sources of cross - correlation between the weak lensing field and the observed cmb map .",
    "one significant source is the thermal sz effect , and it has been indeed shown that the cross - correlation could have the magnitude of @xmath256 for the similar cdm model ( @xcite ) as investigated in this paper .",
    "the sz effect thus produces much larger contribution than the cross - correlation with the doppler effect estimated as @xmath257 .",
    "however , since the thermal sz signal arises mainly from hot plasma in clusters of galaxies at low redshift @xmath258 , it is expected that we can remove this signal from the cross - correlation maps , combined with the x - ray data or the sz maps .",
    "the other possible sources are the cmb foregrounds such as synchrotron radiation from extragalactic dust that may correlate with the dark matter distribution in the large - scale structure .",
    "isolating the signal shown in this paper observationally from the foregrounds will be a great challenge by using the different frequency - dependence ( @xcite ) , though this problem is beyond the scope of this paper .",
