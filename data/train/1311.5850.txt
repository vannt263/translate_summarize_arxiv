    "sparsity has played a central role in recent developments in fields such as signal processing , linear algebra , statistics and optimization .",
    "examples include compressed sensing @xcite , matrix rank minimization @xcite , phase retrieval @xcite and robust principal component analysis @xcite , as well as many others .",
    "a key step in these examples is the use of an @xmath0 norm ( or related quantity ) as a constraint or penalty term in a variational formulation . in all of these examples , sparsity is for the coefficients ( _ i.e. _ , only a small set of coefficients are nonzero ) in a well - chosen set of modes for representation of the corresponding vectors or functions",
    ".    the use of sparse techniques in physical sciences and partial differential equations ( pdes ) has been limited , but recent results have included numerical solutions of pdes with multiscale oscillatory solutions @xcite , efficient material models derived from quantum mechanics calculations @xcite ,  compressed modes \" for variational problems in mathematics and physics @xcite , and  compressed plane waves \" @xcite . in the latter two examples ,",
    "sparsity is used in a new way , in that the solutions are sparse and localized in space ( as opposed to sparsity of the coefficients in some modal representation ) .",
    "sparse solutions with respect to low - rank libraries are used in modeling and approximating dynamical systems , see for example @xcite .    motivated by these works and by the early theoretical framework established in @xcite",
    ", we investigate pdes with @xmath0 subdifferential terms .",
    "the pde is either an elliptic pde coming from a variational principle or a parabolic pde coming from a gradient flow of a convex functional . in either case , the @xmath0 term in the convex functional leads to a subgradient term in the pde .",
    "fortunately , the subgradient term has a simple explicit form , so that the pdes are amenable to analysis and computation .",
    "the goal of this work is to present fast computational schemes for these modified pdes , provide some additional theoretical insights , and show some connections to known physical equations .",
    "our starting point is the convex functional : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a symmetric , positive definite matrix as a function of @xmath4 , and @xmath5 or @xmath6 will be a specified function depending on @xmath4 or @xmath7 .",
    "define the partial differential operator @xmath8 .",
    "minimization of @xmath9 for @xmath5 leads to the following elliptic pde @xmath10 and gradient descent @xmath11 , starting from initial data @xmath12 , leads to the following parabolic pde @xmath13 in which @xmath14 is a subgradient of @xmath15 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath16 , for any @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the @xmath20 inner product",
    ".    the paper is divided as follows : in section  [ formulation_sec ] , we provide the general formulation of the problem . in section  [ various_sec ]",
    ", we review known results and present various properties of solutions to the modified pdes .",
    "the numerical implementation and simulations are presented in sections  [ numerics_sec ] and  [ comp_sec ] , and we conclude in section  [ conc_sec ] .",
    "the problem we consider in this work is to numerically solve the following pde @xmath21 and to verify theoretical results .",
    "the difficulty with such equations is the multivalued nature of the subgradient term .",
    "fortunately for this type of equation , we can explicitly identified the subgradient as @xmath22 note that if @xmath23 and @xmath24 , then @xmath25 .",
    "this specification for @xmath17 was proved in general in @xcite .",
    "it can be shown directly from equations and , as follows . for @xmath23 in an open set , the left side of the equations is @xmath26 so that @xmath27 , which is only possible if @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the value of @xmath14 on a lower dimensional set does not matter , since the value of the forcing terms on a lower dimensional set does not affect the solution @xmath17 of the differential equations . for",
    "the elliptic equation one can also show directly that this identification of @xmath14 gives @xmath23 as the unique minimizer of @xmath9 ( see appendix ) .",
    "in this section we recall the established existence theory for the elliptic equation and the parabolic equation , and provide some further insights to the behavior of solutions .      equation   is related to the general class of elliptic equation : @xmath30 where @xmath31 contains a discontinuous component . the existence and uniqueness of the solution @xmath17",
    "are studied in @xcite .",
    "solutions also satisfy the standard maximum and comparison principles given the correct sign of @xmath31 .",
    "the solutions are compactly supported in both the elliptic and parabolic case , under some additional conditions @xcite . for the parabolic equation ,",
    "the solutions are lipschitz continuous and right differentiable in time .",
    "furthermore , solutions exhibit finite speed of propagation @xcite . more precisely ,",
    "let @xmath32 be the support set of @xmath33 , then for small times @xmath34 :    * if @xmath35 does not vanish on @xmath36 , then @xmath37 * if @xmath35 and @xmath38 vanishes on @xmath36 , then @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the ball of radius @xmath41 centered at the origin . in a simple case , we can construct the exact bounds in order to verify the convergence of the method to a known solution .",
    "at a number of places in the manuscript , we will simplify the presentation by assuming that @xmath42 and that @xmath43 , so that the elliptic pde becomes laplace s equation with nonlinear forcing : @xmath44 and the parabolic pde becomes the heat equation with nonlinear forcing : @xmath45      in 1d , consider the following equation @xmath46 for simplicity assume that @xmath47 and @xmath48 is a decreasing function with @xmath49 as @xmath50 .",
    "denote @xmath51 such that @xmath52 and assume that @xmath53 .",
    "then , the free boundary s endpoint is governed by ( for small time @xmath34 ) : @xmath54 for some @xmath55 ( for the proof , see appendix ) .",
    "a similar result holds for zero force and non - zero ( finitely supported ) initial data .      since it is known that the support is compact , we would like to estimate its size .",
    "in fact , by integrating equation   ( see appendix ) , the support of @xmath17 satisfies @xmath56 a slight modification of ( [ supportbound1 ] ) shows that for any nonnegative @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 , we have @xmath60 in this inequality , the superscript @xmath61 denotes the positive part ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath62 . for the parabolic case ,",
    "a similar bound on the support size holds : @xmath63 for any nonnegative @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath18 be solutions of equation   with initial data @xmath12 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "first , note that for any subgradient @xmath65 of a convex functional , we have @xmath66 we wish to show that the solutions are @xmath0 contractive and tvd by computing the following : @xmath67 the first term is zero by the divergence theorem and the second term is negative by equation  , so we have @xmath68 , and thus the modified pde is an @xmath0 contraction .",
    "moreover , if we take @xmath69 for any @xmath70 we have @xmath71 dividing the equation above by @xmath72 and taking the supremum over all @xmath72 , the following inequality holds : @xmath73 therefore , equation   is tvd .      the @xmath0 contraction and tvd results are directly analogous to those that are obtained by solving the viscosity regularized nonlinear conservation laws : @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "then by letting @xmath76 , one recovers the unique inviscid limit , see @xcite .",
    "we can also easily obtain an `` entropy inequality '' in the same spirit .",
    "consider the scaled modified heat equation : @xmath77 we deliberately put an @xmath78 in front of the diffusion term to emphasize the similarities to the theory of scalar conservation laws .",
    "the following argument holds in more general cases .",
    "let @xmath79 be a convex function of @xmath17 with subgradient @xmath80 . multiplying equation   by the subgradient ( as in @xcite ) yields : @xmath81 for example , if @xmath82 , then whenever @xmath83 , we have @xmath84    we integrate equation   over the region @xmath85 , the support set of @xmath33 defined in section  [ sec_compsupp ] , to get @xmath86 since the spatial gradient is zero along the boundary . by choosing @xmath87 for @xmath88 , equation",
    "provides @xmath89 estimates of the solutions .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath90 for @xmath91 , then @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the set of @xmath4 for which @xmath94 .      we can show that the solutions of the laplace s equation and of the heat equation are smooth .",
    "let @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 denote the sets @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "then the solution @xmath17 of the laplace s equation can be represented by @xmath101 and the solution of the heat equation can be written as @xmath102 in which the green s function @xmath103 for the heat equation and the green s function @xmath104 for the laplace s equation are given by @xmath105 from these formulas , if @xmath48 is continuous , then one can see that @xmath17 is @xmath106 and @xmath107 away from @xmath23 and that @xmath17 is @xmath108 everywhere .      to demonstrate finite speed of propagation ,",
    "consider the 1d - traveling wave solution @xmath109 for @xmath110 , of the equation   with no forcing term . to be specific",
    ", we will assume that @xmath111 for @xmath112 and @xmath113 for @xmath114 .",

    "this traveling wave solution is used as a reference solution to compute the error for our numerical scheme ( see section  [ numtw ] ) .",
    "also , the simple analytic form shows that solutions with non - trivial support sets are easy to find in the modified pde .",
    "we construct the exact solution of equation   with nonnegative force @xmath120 and @xmath121 $ ] .",
    "the exact solution is given explicitly by : @xmath122 where , @xmath123 the boundary value @xmath124 and constant @xmath125 are determined so that @xmath126 .",
    "at the boundary of the support , @xmath127 .",
    "the results show that the solution is nonnegative for nonnegative @xmath48 , and that having @xmath24 does not imply @xmath128 .",
    "given an elliptic operator @xmath129 , we would like to solve problems of the form : @xmath130 or @xmath131 which corresponds to the elliptic or parabolic equations , respectively .",
    "we will present two methods to do so .",
    "the first scheme is semi - implicit ( also known as implicit - explicit or proximal gradient method ) , where the subgradient term is discretized forward in time and the diffusion term is lagged .",
    "we apply this method to solve the time dependent equations .",
    "the second scheme is the douglas - rachford method , which we use to solve both the elliptic problem and the parabolic problem .",
    "both methods can handle the multivalued nature of the subgradient @xmath132 . in this section ,",
    "we denote @xmath133 and @xmath134 the space and time steps of the finite difference schemes .      from the numerical perspective",
    ", the multivalued term @xmath132 is the main source of difficulties , since the value is ambiguous .",
    "however , an operator of the form @xmath135 ( where @xmath31 is convex ) has an easy - to - compute inverse . the inverse operator @xmath136 , also known as the resolvent or proximal operator , @xmath137 , can be found by solving the following optimization : @xmath138 for example , if @xmath139 and thus @xmath140 , we have : @xmath141 where the shrink operator , @xmath142 , is defined point - wise as @xmath143 .    using the proximal operator , we will write the discretization of equation   in a semi - implicit form . we first discretize equation   in time : @xmath144 then to apply the proximal gradient method ,",
    "the last two terms on the left are evaluated at @xmath145 and @xmath146 as follows : @xmath147 the resulting iterative scheme is : @xmath148 for example , for the heat equation , where @xmath149 , the iterative scheme is : @xmath150 and is convergent given @xmath151 .",
    "this scheme has the same complexity as the corresponding standard explicit methods for pde .",
    "the douglas - rachford algorithm for nonlinear multivalued evolution equation was studied in @xcite .",
    "denote @xmath152 , the iterative scheme for equation   is @xmath153u^n,\\ ] ] which can be rewritten as : @xmath154 it was shown that the method is unconditionally stable and convergent for all @xmath155 @xcite . also , note that the iterates @xmath156 converges to a solution of the stationary equation .",
    "for the sandpile problem @xcite , the operators @xmath129 and @xmath157 are chosen specifically as follows : @xmath158 so that the operation for @xmath159 in the iterative process , equation  , is a shrink .",
    "the corresponding proximal operators are @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 . to compute @xmath163 numerically",
    ", we use the fft , where the discrete laplacian @xmath164 is viewed as the convolution of @xmath17 with the finite difference stencil .",
    "since the shrink operator is the last step of the iterative process , this method provides a numerically well - defined support set for @xmath17 , making it easier to locate the free boundary .",
    "in this section we show convergence of our numerical scheme to known solutions , approximations to the support set evolution , and numerical solutions for higher dimension .      in figure  [",
    "fig : tw ] , we solve equation   ( with @xmath165 ) using the implicit - explicit scheme ( equation  ) . the initial data is taken to be the traveling wave profile ( equation  ) with speed @xmath166 .",
    "the numerical solution has the correct support set and speed of propagation , validating the traveling wave solution as well as the numerical method .",
    "+    this is further confirmed in figure  [ fig : converge ] , where the numerical solution is compared to the exact solution . to compute the error",
    ", we use the following norms : @xmath167 where @xmath168 and @xmath169 is the solution at @xmath170 with space resolution @xmath133 . the errors in these three norms",
    "are plotted along side the line representing the second order ( dashed line ) convergence .",
    "( dotted line ) , @xmath20 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath171 ( solid line ) norms in space and @xmath171 norm in time .",

    "the blue dashed line represents second order convergence.,width=288 ]    to test the stability of these traveling wave solutions , we initialize our numerical scheme with the traveling wave profile perturbed by uniformly random noise sampled from @xmath174 $ ] .",
    "the time evolution is shown in figure  [ fig : twn ] . in a short time",
    ", the laplacian term dominates the evolution , which is expected .",
    "the solution gradually smoothes down to a new traveling wave profile and begins to translate at the expected speed .",
    "this shows that the traveling wave solution is an attracting solution , at least locally .",
    "+   +      in figure  [ fig:1dheat ] , the plot shows the modified heat equation ( equation  ) with zero initial data and force @xmath175 .",
    "the solutions evolves upward in time with their support sets marked by red circles .",
    "we see that the computed solutions are indeed compactly supported in space , as the theory states .",
    "the corresponding table provides a least squares fit to estimate the coefficient @xmath176 from equation   under grid refinement .",
    "we see that the coefficient @xmath176 approaches the value 1 quickly within some small approximation error , which is used to verify that our numerical approximation is valid .    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : sg ]    the signum - gordon equation has an interpretation as an approximation to certain physical models @xcite .",
    "the equation takes the form of a second order nonlinear hyperbolic equation : @xmath177 and exhibits both compactly supported traveling waves and oscillatory ( stationary ) soliton - like structures .",
    "this equation can be derived from the lagrangian with the following @xmath0 potential : @xmath178 the equation of motion can be derived from the lagrangian : @xmath179 which is the same as equation   by replacing the @xmath180 term with the subgradient @xmath14 .    to discretize the problem",
    ", we apply the ideas from the proximal gradient method , by placing @xmath14 in the future : @xmath181 and thus , @xmath182    in figure  [ tw : sg ] , we plot our numerical approximation to the traveling wave solution found in @xcite .",
    "since the traveling wave profile is also known analytically , we show numerical convergence of our scheme as @xmath183 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "also , in figure  [ o : sg ] , we show the time evolution of an oscillatory compact soliton - like structure which appears in @xcite .",
    "these examples show the range of behaviors that appear via the addition of an @xmath0 subgradient term .",
    "+   +       +     +     +    as a model for self - assembly and internal diffusion limited aggregation , the sandpile problem has received attention recently @xcite .",
    "the problem is posed discretely , but has the following continuous formulation for the divisible sandpile problem @xcite : @xmath184 where @xmath48 is some non - negative external force . by multiplying equation   with @xmath17 and integrating over @xmath185 , the associated variational",
    "energy is : @xmath186 there are several choices for relaxing the constraint @xmath187 , in particular , we use the following : @xmath188 it can be shown ( via maximum principle ) that for @xmath189 the solution of equation   and equation   are the same .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation for the @xmath0 sandpile problem is : @xmath190 and is solved numerically via the douglas - rachford algorithm ( see equation  ) .",
    "note that if the external force is a finite sum of characteristic functions @xmath191 where @xmath192 are compact sets and @xmath193 , then by integrating equation   over @xmath194 we get : @xmath195 since @xmath187 and @xmath196 is compact .",
    "this refers to preservation of mass .    in figure  [ sandpile ]",
    ", we take @xmath197 , where @xmath198 and @xmath199 are the two overlapping square domains ( on the left ) .",
    "the support set of @xmath17 , given in figure  [ sandpile ] ( right ) , agrees with direct numerical simulation of the discrete sandpile problem .",
    "the direct simulation follows a topping rule described in @xcite .    in figures  [ sandpile :",

    "is given in figures  [ sandpile : flower]-[sandpile : dragon ] ( the bottom right ) with intermediate calculation shown in figures  [ sandpile : flower]-[sandpile : dragon ] ( the remaining plots ) .",
    "to verify that the solutions from our algorithm correspond to the correct solutions for the sandpile problem , we use the mass conservation property , equation  . unlike direct simulation , our method also calculates the function @xmath17 as shown in figure  [ sandpile : dragon2 ] .",
    "one of the benefits of our approach is that the solutions can be computed quickly , for example , our method is at least @xmath203 times faster than direct simulation ( 76 seconds vs. 652 seconds ) at approximating the solution found in figure  [ sandpile : dragon2 ] .",
    "by adding the subdifferential of @xmath0 to certain pdes , we have shown ( numerically and theoretically ) various properties of the solutions .",
    "these problems arise from physical models as well as exact relaxation of other pdes , and could provide useful tools in computing fast approximations to nonlinear problems with a compactly supported free boundary .",
    "this is all in the spirit of borrowing the key idea from compressed sensing , that @xmath0 regularization implies sparsity of discrete systems @xcite , and transferring it to classical problems in pde .",
