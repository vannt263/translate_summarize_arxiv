    "the optical pumping and the laser excitation for pl were performed using a ti : sapphire laser .",
    "the polarization of light was circular for the optical pumping and linear for the pl .",
    "the laser beam was focused on the sample through an optical window on the bottom of the @xmath8he cryostat .",
    "the temperature of the sample was 0.3  k. the direction of the laser beam was parallel to the external magnetic field , which was applied perpendicular to the quantum well .",
    "the beam diameter was @xmath67 m , which was sufficiently larger than the hall bar structure , and the luminescence collection area covered the laser excitation area , as shown in ( b ) .",
    "the pl was collected through the same optical window ( see ( a ) ) .",
    "the collected pl was delivered to the spectrometer by using an optical fiber and the spatially split spectrum was recorded by a ccd camera .",
    "the 2-dimensional electron system of the hall bar was electrically contacted with 6 electrodes , which are shown in ( b ) .",
    "these contacts enable us to measure the resistance by the 4-terminal method and we tuned the electron density in the quantum well by applying a voltage to the back gate .",
    "we construct the relationship between the electron spin polarization and the pl polarization by modeling the oscillator strength ( os ) of a singlet trion as proportional to the number of unpaired electrons with the spin opposite to the photo - created electron spin . by using the constructed relationship",

    "a singlet trion is two conduction band electrons with opposite spin coupling with a valence band hole due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "the pl of the singlet trion shows right or left circular polarization ( @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) depending on the direction of the hole spin . since the pl intensity is generally proportional to the number of the photo - excited particles and their oss , the @xmath33 and @xmath34 pl intensity are given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a constant",
    ", @xmath70 is the number of singlet trion with the up ( down ) spin @xmath71 hole , and @xmath72 is its os .",
    "we define the pl polarization @xmath73 for singlet trion as @xmath74 note that the energies of @xmath33 and @xmath34 pl are different .    according to the study of singlet trion absorption @xcite , since the photo - created electron needs to pair with an opposite spin ,",
    "the os of each trion is proportional to the number of unparied electrons with opposite spin .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a constant , @xmath77 is the fraction of spin up ( down ) @xmath78 electrons that are unpaired , and @xmath79 is the number of @xmath78 electrons .    assuming @xmath80 for @xmath58 @xcite , we substitute eqs .",

    "( [ ppl ] ) and obtain @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the trion spin polarization and @xmath83 is the electron spin polarization . the trion spin polarization @xmath61 is identical to the hole spin polarization , because the two electrons in the trion form a spin singlet state , which has zero resultant spin .      for @xmath85 , we assume @xmath86/n_{\\uparrow(\\downarrow)}$ ] , where @xmath87 is the degeneracy factor of the spin split landau level @xcite .",
    "the similar calculation with @xmath88 gives @xmath89 where @xmath2 is filling factor .",
    "we measured the pl under experimental conditions almost the same as those in the main manuscript .",
    "therefore , the sample we used was a single 18-nm gaas / al@xmath3ga@xmath4as quantum well that was cooled in a cryogen free @xmath8he refrigerator down to 0.3 k. the linearly polarized excitation laser beam with photon energy of @xmath90  ev was injected through an optical window on the bottom of the cryostat and the left circularly polarized pl was collected through the same window with a spectral resolution better than 0.2  mev under the external magnetic field @xmath40 of @xmath917.15  t. negative @xmath40 was used to avoid the optical loss difference caused by the different optical system .",
    "the left circular polarization under negative @xmath40 corresponds to the right circular polarization under positive @xmath40 .",
    "the difference from the main manuscript is the much smaller laser power of 2.4  mw / cm@xmath10 .",

    "( [ pe1 ] ) and ( [ pe2 ] ) , we have to acquire @xmath61 .",
    "the value of @xmath61 generally depends on @xmath40 @xcite . in our experiment , @xmath2 is tuned by using the back gate and the @xmath40 is fixed .",
    "therefore , @xmath61 is expected to be constant in all ranges of @xmath2 .",
    "if one has the knowledge of a certain value of @xmath2 with @xmath94 ( e.g. @xmath95 ) , @xmath73 is equal to @xmath61 and one can obtain the value of @xmath61 from the pl polarization experiment .",
    "however , we can not extract the correct value of @xmath61 from our experimental results .",
    "the fact that the g - factor of gaas is negative indicates that @xmath52 ranges from 0 to 1 in quantum hall regime .",
    "we assume the constant value of @xmath61 is given by the resultant value of @xmath52 satisfied with this range .",

    "<S> the optical pumping was performed as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , the nuclear spin polarization was fully destroyed by setting the electronic state to the skyrmion region @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , right or left circularly polarized light ( @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) illuminated the sample , where the electronic state was set to @xmath2 during illumination . </S>",

    "<S> although the peak positions of the absorption and luminescence are not completely coincident , the luminescence peak can be used as the indicator of the absorption peak due to the relatively small energy difference @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the increase of the peak energies as @xmath2 increases is understood by the quantum confined stark effect because we controlled @xmath2 using the gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> taking into consideration the spectral width of the pumping laser ( full with at half maximum @xmath410.6  mev ) , we find that the nuclear polarization basically occurs at the pl peak positions . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear polarization at the triplet trion peak is larger than that at the singlet trion peak . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in terms of the pl peak as the indicator of the absorption peak ( the details will be discussed in the next paragraph . ) , we observe the correlation between the nuclear polarization and the photoexcited complex absorption . </S>",
    "<S> this accounts for the difference between regions ( i ) and ( ii ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fillingdep.eps ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we here consider what information for the photon absorption is elicited from the observed pl since the absorption is important to polarize nuclear spins as mentioned above . </S>",

    "<S> the neutral exciton has greater oscillator strength than the triplet trion in the absorption measurement @xcite and in the numerical calculations in high @xmath40-field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can attribute the nuclear polarization at the triplet pl peak to the absorption of the neutral exciton @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> our experimental results indicate that the photo - excitation of @xmath42 leads to higher nuclear polarization than that of @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the photon absorption rate is proportional to the number of the injected electron spins , which subsequently polarizes the nuclear spin . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 in high @xmath40-field or at low @xmath6 is expected to have larger absorption than @xmath43 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can explain our results simply . </S>",
    "<S> however , the absorption measurement does not always show such behavior under the experimental conditions similar to ours @xcite . to polarize nuclear spins , primarily </S>",
    "<S> , the electron spin polarization under optical pumping @xmath44 is more crucial than the number of injected electron spins . </S>",
    "<S> the effective nuclear magnetic field after long pumping time is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a constant and @xmath47 is the equilibrium electron spin polarization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this fact and the experimental results indicate that the photo - excitation of @xmath42 generates higher @xmath44 than that of @xmath43 in the quantum hall regime . indeed , this can be expected from the study of optical spin pumping in the ii - vi quantum well @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there is a possibility that @xmath42 directly and indirectly polarizes the nuclear spins , because the electron in @xmath42 has @xmath48-type symmetry , which considerably contributes to the contact hyperfine interaction , and because @xmath42 forms @xmath43 by capturing the resident electron .     </S>",
