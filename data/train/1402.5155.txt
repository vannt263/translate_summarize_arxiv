    "we observed an intermediate optimal value of @xmath0 for which the fraction of cooperators in the steady state is maximal in the pd quadrant . on the other hand , when layers are regular random graphs , the level of cooperation in the pd layer registers a significant increase from full defection as @xmath0 decreases from @xmath17 , as is shown in fig .",
    "we have also shown that different arrangements of interconnections between layers result in fundamentally different structures of absorbing states for @xmath34 , that is the limit case in which individuals can only imitate neighbors through the interlinks .",

    "<S> interdependent networks are organized in two or more layers ( subnetworks ) , in which the functioning of a node in one layer depends on neighbor nodes in other layers . </S>",
    "<S> multiplex networks @xcite , on the other hand , are composed of a single type of node and several types ( `` colors '' ) of links . </S>",
    "<S> one example of a real multiplex network is the transportation network of a city : nodes represent locations in the city , and links are of different type depending on the transportation system(s ) that connect two given locations ( metro , autobus , etc ) . </S>",
    "<S> interdependent networks have already been applied in studies in diverse areas of science @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is significant progress in the understanding of their percolation properties and robustness @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> network science @xcite , together with evolutionary game theory @xcite , helps to understand how cooperative behavior can emerge and evolve in structured populations of selfish individuals . </S>",

    "<S> defectors on the other hand do not contribute , yet reap the benefit ( which we assume to be larger than the cost ) . </S>",

    "<S> populations individuals only interact with their nearest neighbors , and it becomes possible for cooperators to escape exploitation by defectors by forming clusters in which they support each other . </S>",

    "<S> the code of conduct in each company may be different , depending on its internal organization and goals . </S>",
