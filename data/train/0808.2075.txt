    "lanthanum cobaltite is a rhombohedral ( @xmath6 ) perovskite that has been of continued interest for the last half - century , due in part to the many magnetic phase transitions that occur as a function of temperature , pressure and chemical doping @xcite .",

    "the nature of this spin - state transition is still under debate : inelastic neutron scattering @xcite , x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) and magnetic circular dichroism experiments @xcite suggest a first - order transition to the high - spin ( hs ) state , while other x - ray photoemission ( xps ) and xas spectra in addition to electron energy loss ( eels ) spectroscopy suggest the intermediate - spin ( is ) state @xcite .",
    "similarly , hartree - fock cluster @xcite and full - potential dft calculations @xcite suggest the hs state is more stable than the is state , while other lsda + @xmath0 calculations obtain the reverse result @xcite .",

    "@xcite co@xmath5 is a particularly interesting case , however , because the low - spin state is non - magnetic and so the spin - state transition increases the magnetic moment to a finite value from an initial value of zero .",
    "interestingly , at the transition to the @xmath34 state , we find @xmath37=0.27 , which is low compared to most moderately- or strongly - correlated magnets ; in addition , @xmath10 is largely independent of @xmath28 ( not shown ) . for all @xmath28 values",

    "the critical @xmath28 value we have determined with this approach is in good agreement with x - ray photoemission experiments reported in ref .   and recent first - principles calculations in ref .",
    "therefore , for the remainder of this study , we strictly use values of @xmath38  ev unless noted otherwise .",
    "the strong dependence of the ground - state spin configuration on @xmath28 partly explains the inconsistencies between different first - principles calculations in describing the evolution of the spin - state transition .      before investigating the effects of strain on the magnetic behavior",

    "furthermore , as evident in figure [ fig : is_dos ] , hybridization and covalency between the o @xmath42 and co @xmath43 states causes dramatic deviations from the simple molecular cluster picture by causing strong broadening of the bands ; in particular the co @xmath44 orbitals span more than 11 ev in energy . in figure",

    "the hole in the @xmath36 manifold consists of a superposition of the minority @xmath52 orbitals , and the `` missing '' electron occupying the lower part of the majority @xmath44 band is in a @xmath53 state .",
    "this behavior causes our calculated ferromagnetic intermediate - spin state to be half - metallic .",

    "spin - state transitions in bulk lacoo@xmath1 are known to occur as a function of unit cell volume@xcite , where the tendency for an excited spin state is favored for larger unit cell volumes due to competition between the energy penalty in forming a singlet state and the gain in hund s exchange energy favoring ferromagnetic alignment of spins .",
    "this is evidenced by the fact that high spin co@xmath5 has a larger ionic radius ( 0.61   ) , compared to the low spin co@xmath5 ( 0.55  ).@xcite indeed , this is consistent with our calculations for the ideal cubic pervoskite where the lsda@xmath54 equilibrium volume of the intermediate state is approximately 2% larger than that of the low spin configuration . in this section",

    "we find that , for @xmath28 below our calculated critical value , the low - spin ground state is stable up to strains of 4% ; therefore we predict that strain - induced changes in lattice parameters alone are insufficient to cause a spin - state transition in lacoo@xmath1 up to reasonable strain values .",

    "next we isolate the influence of these octahedral rotations by manually disabling them while applying strain .",
    "our motivation is two - fold .",
    "first , there is experimental evidence suggesting that lacoo@xmath1 grows in such a ` cube - on - cube ' manner on many substrates @xcite .",
    "second , disabling the octahedral rotations causes the system to respond to strain by changing the local symmetry around the co ion ; therefore we can examine the influence of the crystal field on the spin - state transition .",

    "our main finding is that , at the experimental @xmath71 ratio , the is state is lower in energy than the ls , and therefore we predict that the co ions should be magnetic . the origin of the stabilization of the intermediate state is the lifting of the octahedral crystal field by the tetragonal symmetry adopted when the octahedral rotations are disabled .",
    "small ( @xmath72 ) uniaxial expansion of the out - of - plane lattice constant modifies the tetragonal crystal field splitting sufficiently to favor occupation of the @xmath44 manifold .",
    "in contrast , when octahedral rotations are allowed , strain is accommodated through changes in the rotation angles rather than through modification of the local bond lengths around the co ions ; the local crystal field splitting is therefore largely unchanged and the diamagnetic state remains stable .",
    "next we investigate whether the ferromagnetic order imposed so far for computational convenience is indeed the lowest energy magnetic ordering by comparing its energy with those of the a - type antiferromagnetic ( a - afm ) , and g - type antiferromagnetic ( g - afm ) orderings for this structure .",

    "this is consistent with the experimentally observed ferromagnetism .",
    "intriguingly , the structure with disabled octahedral rotations relaxes to a polar space group ( @xmath73 ) with the co@xmath5 ion moving 0.06   off - center in the @xmath74 plane . by summing the formal ionic charges multiplied by their displacements from their centrosymmetric positions we find an in - plane polarization of 17.5  @xmath75c/@xmath76 at the experimental @xmath77 ratio . note",
    "that since our overall electronic ground state is metallic , we are unable to evaluate the electronic contribution to the polarization using the standard berry s phase approach .",
    "indeed the onset of ferroelectric polarization caused by the disabling of octahedral rotations in perovskite oxides has been noted in a number of calculations , and is believed to result from the off - centering of ions to maintain a favorable bond order @xcite .",
    "however , since our electronic structure is overall metallic , we can not predict ferroelectric behavior .",
    "while our finding of ferromagnetism is consistent with recent experimental reports , there are some important differences between our computations and the experimental observations .",
    "first , and analogous to the bulk intermediate - spin case , our calculated tetragonal structure is half - metallic , with a broad majority spin o @xmath42 - co @xmath44 band crossing the fermi level ; experimentally the ferromagnetic films are found to be insulating .",
    "in addition , the sizes of most measured magnetic moments are an order of magnitude smaller than our calculated value .",
    "recent x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) experiments on thin films , however , find a local co moment of 1.2  @xmath15 , which is in better agreement with our calculations @xcite . in this last section",
    "we attempt to reconcile our finding of a strain - induced half - metallic ferromagnetic arrangement with experimental reports of insulating lacoo@xmath1 on lsat .",
    "in particular , we explore likely jahn - teller distortions and orbital orderings which are known to allow both ferromagnetism and insulating behavior in oxides @xcite .",
    "we also examine the effect of including spin - orbit interactions in our calculations , since these couplings can make significant contributions to determining the orbital occupation in many transition metal oxides .",
    "the possibility of an orbitally ordered state in lacoo@xmath1 was suggested previously in ref .  , and unrestricted hartree - fock calculations on similar materials @xcite found that small jahn - teller structural distortions can stabilize an insulating state .",
    "cooperative jahn - teller distortions ( ranging from 1 to 6% from low to room temperature ) have indeed been demonstrated in lacoo@xmath1 with various techniques including high - resolution x - ray diffraction @xcite , raman scattering @xcite , and neutron diffraction @xcite .",

    "the type - d jahn - teller distorted structure is shown with the possible @xmath44 orbital ordering configuration .",
    "the orbital degeneracy is also split at each of the two sites , according to the orientation of the elongation of the oxygen octahedra with respect to the @xmath70 lattice parameter.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    this 2d antiferrodistortive behavior allows for @xmath50 and @xmath51 orbital ordering due to the splitting of the @xmath44 degeneracy from the structural distortions of the oxygen octahedra .",

    "examined no @xmath44 orbital order is observed , in spite of the imposed octahedral structural distortions .",
    "due to the degeneracy of the co @xmath44 states at the fermi level , although the density of states is reduced , a half - metallic ferromagnetic state persists .",
    "in contrast , the higher energy g - afm structure considered earlier is insulating .",
    "finally , we examine the effect of spin - orbit interactions in lacoo@xmath1 , since such coupling of the magnetic spin degrees of freedom to the lattice can change the relative level splitting and degeneracy of spin and orbital ground states in the 3@xmath9 transition metal oxides.@xcite for the diamagnetic @xmath29 configuration we find that spin - orbit interaction has a negligible effect on the electronic structure as expected for a filled @xmath36 manifold . on the other hand , in a recent theoretical study@xcite it was suggested the @xmath34 state does show significant changes in the electronic structure near the fermi level when spin orbit interactions are included .",
    "in contrast to those results which used a generalized - gradient approximation ( gga@xmath54 ) for the exchange - correlation functional , we do not find significant deviations in the electronic structure when spin - orbit coupling is included in the calculations .",
    "this result is likely due to the difference in the description of our starting intermediate spin - state configurations : we begin with a half - metallic ground state , whereas in ref .",
    ", a fully metallic state is found with a high density of states at the fermi level . when spin - orbit coupling is included in the calculation , the large peak feature is naturally split into a doublet .",
    "the origin of the two inconsistencies  our half - metallic rather than insulating ground state , and larger magnetic moment per co ion compared with experiment  might lie in the difficulties associated with producing and characterizing high quality , uniform transition metal oxide films , or from a failure of the lsda+@xmath0 method to fully describe the complex orbital physics .",
    "future theoretical investigations should consider more sophisticated methods such as dynamical mean field theory , in which dynamical correlations ( spin fluctuations ) can in principle be treated explicitly .",
    "indeed , recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements report a small jahn - teller distortion which has short - range dynamical character @xcite .",
    "this dynamic jahn - teller effect is consistent with a proposed vibronic @xmath80o@xmath81 superexchange between intermediate - spin co atoms @xcite , and would allow for fluctuations of afm exchange which should reduce the magnetic moment . on the experimental front",
    ", our calculations suggest that more detailed characterization of the _ local _ electronic and structural properties will be invaluable in understanding and exploiting the spin behavior of lacoo@xmath1 films .",
    "in summary , by comparing our calculated lsda@xmath54 spin state of bulk lacoo@xmath1 with the measured low temperature behavior , we have determined a critical upper bound of 4 ev on the hubbard @xmath0 parameter for lsda@xmath54 calculations for lacoo@xmath1 . using our critical @xmath0 value",
    ", we have established that strain - induced changes in lattice parameters are insufficient to cause transitions to finite magnetic moment spin states at reasonable values of strain . instead ,",
