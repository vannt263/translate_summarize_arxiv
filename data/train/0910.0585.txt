    "recently , much effort has been paid on ensembles of trapped atoms as promising candidates for quantum state engineering and quantum information processing ( qip ) , such as realization of quantum repeater repeater1,dlcz , repeater2 , storage and generation of photonic states @xcite , and entanglement generation of the collective degrees of freedom in separate atomic ensembles entan1,entan2,entan3 .",
    "due to no need of addressing atoms individually and to the enhanced interaction with light , the atomic ensemble qubits seem superior to the single - particle qubits in qip .",
    "however , the interface between the atomic ensemble and the light based on raman scattering in above schemes requires the state of the atomic ensemble to be transformed into a photon travelling in a well - defined direction within a well - controlled period of time .",
    "more importantly , it is experimentally more challenging to achieve universal operations for qip than quantum communication @xcite between different atomic ensemble qubits by interfacing collective atomic excitations with single photon pulses .    an attractive technique for a nontrivial two - qubit gating between atomic ensembles has been proposed in @xcite , in which the dipole - dipole interaction between highly excited rydberg states blocks transitions of more than one rydberg excitation .",
    "this is called the rydberg blockade @xcite , which has been observed in clouds of cold atoms exper1,exper2,exper3,exper4,exper5,exper6,exper7 as well as in a bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of proposals to use the rydberg blockade for various qip tasks @xcite , most of which , however , are hard for scaling to a large numbers of qubits required for a working qip .",
    "one of the main problems for scalability is that the rydberg blockade only produces effective interaction within a certain interaction range .",
    "although it is possible to interconnect two distant qubits by repeated using swap operations between neighboring qubits , the error threshold for swap operations would much suppress the scalability @xcite .",
    "together with the state - of - the - art techniques in cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite and the recent impressive experimental advance for rydberg blockade @xcite , we put forward a scalable ensemble - based qip scheme with the collective states of the atomic ensembles encoding the qubits and the flying photons as ancillas . making use of the single - photon input - output process @xcite",
    ", we employ optical cavities with each confining an atomic ensemble under the far - off - resonant interaction , which could produce a phase flip for each input single - photon pulse , and thereby could be extended to controlled quantum gating between different atomic ensemble qubits .",
    "we will show that the gating is insensitive to the rydberg blockade error and also to the variation of the coupling rate @xmath0 even if the atoms are not well localized within the lamb - dicke regime .",
    "our scheme is also robust to the errors due to the photon loss from the atomic spontaneous emission , the photon collection and the detection inefficiency , because the photon loss only reduces the success rate of the gating but has no affect on the fidelity of the gating under our measurement .",
    "in addition , the building block of our scheme could be readily used to generate cluster states with two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice geometry and to carry out conditional gating between two remote qubits .",
    "moreover , we will show the availability of our scheme in different conditions , e.g. , in the good or bad cavity and in weak or strong coupling regime .",
    "our scheme has following advantages .",
    "@xmath1 the entanglement between two atomic ensemble qubits is achieved by a single photon flying sequentially through two cavities confining the two atomic ensemble qubits respectively .",
    "this process is intrinsically of higher success rate than those based on coincident detection of two emitting photons going through a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "@xmath2 compared to the single atom cases , the enhancement of the coherent coupling by @xmath3 in our scheme , with @xmath4 the number of the atoms in the ensemble , could somewhat relax the experimental requirement .",
    "this also enables fast qubit rotation and the efficient readout in our scheme , useful for measurement - based quantum computation .",
    "our atomic ensembles in the cavities can also function as good quantum repeaters for long - distance quantum communication @xcite . as a result ,",
    "quantum computation and quantum communication are readily switchable with each other in our system . @xmath5 compared with a previous proposal @xcite for generation of atomic ensemble cluster state , our scheme is more efficient and the repetition attempts only scale up polynomially with the atomic ensemble qubit number .",
    "@xmath6 our scheme can work well under wide range of experimental parameters , where the quantum gating associated with the case of the weak coupling or large cavity decay is made by means of the faraday rotation .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the next section focuses on the interaction between a single - photon pulse and an atomic ensemble in an optical cavity , which yields a controlled phase flip ( cpf ) gating .",
    "the single - photon pulse going through different spatially separate cavities could lead to entanglement and quantum gating between the confined atomic ensembles , as discussed in section iii .",
    "we will consider in sections iv and v the experimental feasibility of our scheme and the possibility of our scheme working in the weak coupling regime or in bad cavity .",
    "the last section is for a short summary .",
    "the rydberg blockade @xcite relies on the interaction between the atoms in the ensemble , which is intrinsically of the weak @xmath7 or @xmath8 van der waals type in the absence of external electric field with @xmath9 the distance between the atoms . under an external electric field , however , the interaction would be much enhanced because the rydberg states own permanent dipole moments @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the principal quantum number , @xmath12 the electronic charge and @xmath13 the bohr radius . unfortunately ,",
    "if the two atoms @xmath14 and @xmath15 are fixed , it has been found @xcite that the interaction would be vanishing when the angle @xmath16 between the interatomic separation @xmath17 and the electric field @xmath18 approaches @xmath19 . in the case of an atomic ensemble with @xmath20 identical atoms within the blockade range , however , it is not practical to fully avoid @xmath21 , \\text { } j >",

    "the interaction for the blockade is at fster resonance .",

    "the rydberg blockade guarantees only a single excitation in the atomic ensemble .    if @xmath44 or @xmath45 , the single qubit rotation corresponds to the pauli @xmath46 or hadamard gate .",
    "moreover , the rydberg states should be excited in a doppler - free fashion , which can be accomplished using two counter - propagating laser waves .",
    "as the logical qubits can be rotated rapidly @xcite and measured with high efficiency by resonance fluorescence detection @xcite , our scheme would be useful for one - way quantum computation @xcite , as discussed later .",

    "the box d includes a pbs and two single - photon detectors for the output.,width=302,height=86 ]      combined with the rydberg blockade , our basic building block for qip works based on the cavity input - output process . as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , the atomic ensemble is trapped in a one - sided cavity . the atomic transition between @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "is coupled resonantly to the cavity mode @xmath50 and also resonantly driven by the @xmath51 polarization component of the input single - photon pulse . in the rotating frame with respect to the cavity frequency , the interaction of the atoms with the cavity mode is described by the hamiltonian , @xmath52where @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 is the coupling rate between the @xmath14th atom and the cavity mode . for simplicity of treatment",

    "normally , from the above model , we can directly obtain the result @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "our simulation shown in fig .",
    "3 demonstrates that the output pulse shapes @xmath87 and @xmath88 overlap very well with the input pulse shape @xmath81 .",
    "consequently , the fidelity @xmath89 of the cpf gate is determined by the shape matching degree , as plotted in fig .",
    "4(a ) where the gating is nearly with the fidelity up to @xmath90 in the case that the pulse duration @xmath91 is much larger than @xmath92 .    furthermore",
    ", the gating fidelity is insensitive to the variation of the coupling rate .",
    "although @xmath0 varies by a factor of 2 due to the residual atomic motion in current experiments @xcite , the change of the fidelity in our calculation is only about @xmath93 . as a result ,",
    "the atoms is not necessarily to be strictly localized within the lamb - dicke regime . in our numerical simulation ,",

    "the above cpf gating between the atomic ensemble and the single - photon can be extended to nontrivial two - qubit gating between atomic ensembles as illustrated in fig .",
    "2(b ) , where @xmath102@xmath103 box corresponding to the setup in fig .",
    "2(a ) functions as the cpf gate between the atomic ensemble @xmath104 and the single - photon .",
    "the single - photon pulse injected into the box is initially prepared in the state @xmath105 with @xmath106 and @xmath107 the photonic state with polarizations @xmath51 and @xmath47 , respectively . the pulse is reflected successively from the two boxes , with a half - wave plate ( hwp ) inserted into the optical path between the two boxes which performs the rotation @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the final output single - photon pulse after passing through a hwp is detected by its polarization corresponding to the measurement of the polarization in the basis @xmath110 .    by a straightforward algebra",

    "if the detection is made on the state @xmath112 , the cpf gating could also succeed after an additional single - qubit operation @xmath113 on the atomic ensemble @xmath114 . as a result , a cnot gate , with the cpf gate sandwiched by two hadamard gates , is available .",
    "assume the atomic ensembles @xmath115 and @xmath114 to be initially prepared in the state @xmath116 , and then in the state @xmath117@xmath118 by hadamard gates with @xmath119 .",

    "this is to say , if the output photon is detected as described in above subsection , we obtain successfully the state in eq .",
    "the idea could be directly extended to many - qubit case .",
    "for instance , two pairs of atomic ensembles @xmath122 and @xmath123 have been prepared independently in the state @xmath124 .",
    "the two pairs of atomic ensembles could be connected by a cpf gate between the qubits @xmath114 and @xmath125 , which yields a four - partite atomic cluster state , @xmath126where @xmath127 . with the similar idea to above operations",
    ", we can efficiently generate an @xmath11-party atomic ensemble cluster state @xmath128with the convention @xmath129 .",
    "if the success probability of the cpf gate is @xmath130 and the time for each attempt of the cpf gate is @xmath131 , the total preparation time for an @xmath11-qubit cluster state is @xmath132 , a polynomial function of @xmath11 , growing much more slowly than the exponential scaling in @xcite . in realistic implementation",
    ", the interface between atomic ensembles and photons with high success probability favors a high efficiency of cluster state generation .",
    "in fact , the one - dimensional ( 1d ) cluster states are not sufficient for a universal quantum computation .",
    "recent studies @xcite have shown a highly efficient generation of cluster states with any complex 2d lattice geometry even in the case of low success probability of the cpf gating . following the ideas in @xcite ,",
    "if we have two sufficiently long cluster chains which can be done _ off - line _ , the state in @xmath133-shape @xcite or in star shape @xcite with identical legs could be generated as the building block of the 2d geometry by the shrinking and removing techniques on the cluster states .",
    "taking the @xmath133-shape as an example , via a cpf gate operation , we may fuse the end qubits of one of the legs of the two @xmath133-shape cluster states .",
    "if it works , and there are still redundant leg qubits between the two center qubits in the shapes , we can remove the qubits by applying simple @xmath46 measurements on the qubits ( i.e. , the removing technique ) . simply repeating the procedure",
    ", an arbitrary 2d lattice geometry can be easily constructed . due to the high success probability of the cpf gating in our scheme",
    ", we can achieve a much more efficient scaling than in previous schemes @xcite .",
    "quantum communication over long - distance remains challenging due to exponential attenuation of the transmitted signals .",
    "fortunately , quantum repeater could resolve the fiber attenuation problem , reducing the exponential scaling to polynomial scaling repeater2,dlcz , repeater1 .",
    "following the duan - lukin - cirac - zoller model @xcite , the quantum repeater can also be realized in the present system with pairs of atomic ensembles trapped in separate cavities . by adiabatically changing the rabi frequencies of the pumping and repumping pulses with a large detuning @xcite ,",
    "we can store and retrieve the information at will .",
    "note that the scattered photon will go to some other optical modes other than the signal mode .",
    "however , when the atomic number @xmath4 is large , the independent spontaneous emissions distribute over all the atomic modes , whereas the contribution to the signal light mode would be small , leading to a high signal - to - noise ratio @xmath134 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the use of atomic ensembles as a quantum node could result in collective enhancement .",
    "moreover , with the high - fidelity entanglement generated by the quantum repeater , the high - fidelity controlled operation can be realized between two remote quantum nodes , as shown in fig .",
    "besides quantum communication @xcite , we show below that the entanglement between two remote atomic ensembles @xmath135 and @xmath136 is useful for quantum gating between two remote atomic ensembles or between two atoms .",
    "this helps for distributed qip . as an example , we show how to achieve a cnot gate between two remote single atoms @xmath137 and @xmath138 ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "this can be understood by following identity @xmath139 where @xmath140 means a cnot gate on qubit @xmath141 conditional on @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 denotes the single qubit pauli operators acting on the corresponding qubits @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it can be easily seen that , the key step for the nonlocal cnot gate is the local cnot gate between atomic ensemble and single atom qubits , which could be accomplished by the similar steps in section iii(a ) . after implementing the local cnot gate , we should measure the ensemble qubit @xmath135 in the basis @xmath147 and @xmath136 in the basis @xmath148 .",
    "the measurement results @xmath149 corresponds to a single qubit operation @xmath150 on the single atom qubits . making use of the atomic ensemble qubits and the photon - mediated interaction",
    ", we could achieve the high - fidelity remote quantum cnot gate between two single atoms .",
    "as a result , a high - fidelity long - distance entanglement is mapped to two single atoms , which can be used for faithful quantum state transfer over long distance @xcite .",
    "this nonlocal gating also provides a basic tool for distributed quantum computation @xcite .",
    "whether the rydberg blockade works well or not depends critically on the weakest interaction between the most apart atoms in the ensemble . as a result , it is important to choose appropriately the rydberg state for carrying out our scheme . at a characteristic length scale of @xmath151 ,",
    "the usual van der waals interaction could be treated as the frster interaction .",
    "then the rydberg  rydberg potential energy can be written as @xmath152 , corresponding to the frster resonant case @xmath153 , the frster defect @xmath154 , the eigenvalue of the schrdinger equation for the van der waals interaction with fine structure @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 @xcite .",

    "in contrast , if @xmath167 only varies from @xmath168 to @xmath169 , the fidelity is insensitive to the the double excitation probability .     with respect to atomic separation @xmath9 for different rydberg states .",

    "the atoms can be confined inside a potential well along the cavity axis with a nearly fixed value of @xmath176 .",
    "but the intracavity fields of the fort beam form many potential wells inside the cavity with different coupling rates in different potential wells .",

    "<S> we present a scheme for scalable quantum information processing ( qip ) with atomic ensembles and flying photons . using the rydberg blockade </S>",
    "<S> , we encode the qubits in the collective atomic states , which could be manipulated fast and easily due to the enhanced interaction , in comparison to the single - atom case . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that our proposed gating could be applied to generation of two - dimensional cluster states for measurement - based quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the atomic ensembles also function as quantum repeaters useful for long distance quantum state transfer . </S>",
    "<S> we show the possibility of our scheme to work in bad cavity or in weak coupling regime , which could much relax the experimental requirement . </S>",
    "<S> the efficient coherent operations on the ensemble qubits enable our scheme to be switchable between quantum computation and quantum communication using atomic ensembles . </S>"
