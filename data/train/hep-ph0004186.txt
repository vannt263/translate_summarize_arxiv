    "the quantum theory contains an additional parameter , the @xmath12-angle , that violates cp .",
    "the experimental limit on this parameter is @xmath13 @xcite , so we will set it to zero for the purposes of this article .",
    "one can evaluate qcd scattering amplitudes in powers of @xmath0 using a feynman diagram expansion . as is typical in a quantum field theory , loop graphs are divergent and need to be treated using a renormalization scheme .",
    "the most commonly used scheme is modified minimal subtraction ( ) @xcite , and we will use this scheme throughout .",
    "an important consequence of renormalization is that the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath9 of the qcd lagrangian depend in a calculable manner on the  subtraction - scale @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath14 dependence of @xmath0 is described by the @xmath15-function , @xmath16 in perturbation theory , @xmath17 where ( for @xmath18 flavors of quarks ) @xmath19 and the next two terms are also known  @xcite .    if @xmath0 is small , the renormalization group equation eq .",

    "the vanishing of the qcd coupling for large values of @xmath14 is referred to as asymptotic freedom .",
    "one important consequence of asymptotic freedom , is that qcd processes at high energies can be reliably computed in a perturbation expansion in @xmath0 .",
    "a measurable quantity , such as the total cross - section for @xmath26 at high energies can be computed as a function of the qcd coupling constant @xmath27 and the center of mass energy @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a dimensionless function of its arguments .",
    "the form of the cross - section given in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) follows from dimensional analysis : @xmath31 has dimensions of @xmath32 , and @xmath14 has dimensions of energy . in the  sscheme ,",

    "even if @xmath27 is small , the perturbation expansion can break down if @xmath37 is large .",

    "many methods have been proposed to determine the optimum scale to use for a given calculation @xcite .",
    "the only way to determine the `` best '' scale at a given order is to compute the cross - section at next order .",

    "perturbation theory is valid if one chooses @xmath14 to be of order @xmath28 , so that the expansion parameter is @xmath40 , with no large logarithms .",
    "this shows that at high - energies , the coupling constant is small because of asymptotic freedom , and qcd cross - sections are approximately those of free quarks and gluons . at low , energies ,",
    "non - perturbative effects become important .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is determined by computing a quantity in terms of @xmath0 , and comparing with its measured value .",

    "high energy processes can be computed more reliably precisely because they do not depend very much on @xmath0 .",

    "we will see in this article that low - energy extractions of @xmath0 have comparable errors to those at high energy .",
    "in addition to scale dependence , the coupling constant @xmath0 is also subtraction scheme dependent .",
    "the scheme dependence of the coupling constant is compensated for by the scheme dependence in the functional form for a measurable quantity , so that the value of an observable is scheme independent .",
    "the  scheme will be used in this article , but there is still some residual scheme dependence we need to consider . in the  scheme , heavy quarks do not decouple in loop graphs at low - energy .",

    "this expression is true for all energies , irrespective of the mass of the quark .",
    "one might expect that at energies much smaller than the mass @xmath42 of a heavy quark , the quark does not contribute to the @xmath15-function .",
    "this can not happen in the  scheme , since  is a mass - independent subtraction scheme , which results in a mass - independent @xmath15-function .",
    "what happens is that there are large logarithms of the form @xmath43 that compensate for the `` incorrect '' @xmath15-function at low - energies . in practice ,",
    "one deals with this problem using an effective field theory . at energies smaller than @xmath42 ,",
    "one switches from a qcd lagrangian with @xmath18 flavors to a qcd lagrangian with @xmath44 flavors by integrating out the heavy quark flavor .",
    "the effect of the heavy quark is taken into account by higher dimension operators in the qcd lagrangian , and by shifts in the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath9 .",
    "thus it is necessary to specify the effective theory when quoting the value of @xmath0 .",

    "in addition to the perturbative effects discussed so far , non - perturbative effects play an important role in strong interaction processes .",
    "the size of non - perturbative effects is governed by the ratio of the strong interaction scale @xmath51 to the typical energy @xmath28 of a given process . in many cases ,",
    "non - perturbative effects are estimated using a model analysis , or by a phenomenological fit to the experimental data .",
    "a few processes can be analyzed rigorously using the operator product expansion ( ope)@xcite ; in this case , one can calculate the size of non - perturbative effects in terms of matrix elements of gauge invariant local operators .",

    "the existence of an ope provides some crucial information on the size of non - perturbative corrections . for @xmath62 , we know that the corrections vanish at least as fast as @xmath67 for large values of @xmath68 , because @xmath69 is the lowest dimension operator that can contribute in the ope . similarly , it is known in deep inelastic scattering that the first non - perturbative corrections arise from twist - four operators , and are of order @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the momentum transfer .",
    "one can estimate the size of non - perturbative corrections for processes with an ope , by estimating the value of operator matrix elements . in some cases ,",
    "one is fortunate enough that the relevant matrix element can actually be determined from some other measurement , or computed from first principles .",
    "the size of non - perturbative corrections is much less certain if the process does not have an ope .",
    "non - perturbative effects can fall off like a fractional power of @xmath72 , or could have some more complicated dependence on @xmath68 .",
    "typically , one uses some model estimate of the non - perturbative corrections .",
    "perturbative and non - perturbative corrections to scattering cross - sections are interrelated , because the qcd perturbation series is an asymptotic expansion , rather than a convergent expansion . a dimensionless quantity @xmath73 has an expansion of the form @xmath74",
    "typically , the coefficients @xmath75 grow as @xmath76 , so that the series has zero radius of convergence .",
    "the large - order behavior of the perturbation series can be computed in certain limiting cases  @xcite .",
    "if one studies qcd in the limit of a large number of flavors , @xmath77 , with @xmath78 fixed , one can sum all terms of the form @xmath79 .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as the `` bubble chain '' approximation , because the graphs one sums are of the type show in fig .",
