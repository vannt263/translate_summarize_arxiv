    "the _ kepler _ observatory began science operation in may 12 , 2009 , with the main scientific goal of discovering exoplanet candidates transiting their host stars .",
    "the _ kepler _ input catalog ( kic , @xcite ) includes @xmath2150000 targets .",
    "the _ kepler _ telescope is a defocused 0.95-/1.4-m schmidt camera with a field of view of about 100 square degrees .    for a detailed description of the _ kepler _ mission and design , see the _ kepler _ technical documents web page and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "here we provide a brief review of the relevant characteristics . on the telescope focal plane",
    "there is an array of 21 modules , each of which associated to two 2k@xmath41k ccds .",
    "each ccd is read out in two 1k@xmath41k channels , for a total of 84 independent channels over the whole focal plane . on january 12 , 2010 , one module failed ( mod-3 ) and a second one ( mod-7 ) failed on february 2014 .",
    "so , currently only 76 channels are operative .",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath24 arcsec pixel@xmath5 , and the deliberate defocusing causes the average point - spread function ( psf ) to extend across several pixels ( except in the area close to the center of the field ) .",
    "even so , many features of the psf are undersampled , even in the outskirts of the field . knowing the exact shape of the psf is the key for high precision photometry in crowded fields .",
    "the determination of an appropriate psf for the _ kepler _ images represents the main effort of this work .    due to limitation in telemetry",
    ", the scientific data were downloaded once a month using a maximum data - transfer rate of approximately 550 kb / s .",
    "for this reason the _ kepler _ spacecraft conducts its own pre - reduction of the data , and sends only a small portion of the exposed pixels . around each target , a small area ( a `` stamp '' ) of various dimensions ( typically a few pixels square ) is read out with an integration time of 6.02 s. every 270 exposures , the stamps are co - added on board to create a long - cadence stamp of about 29 minutes of total integration time ; short cadences involve adding 9 exposures for a one - minute integration time .",
    "a time series of such long- or short - cadence stamps is called a target - pixel file ( tpf ) .",
    "when several targets of interest are in a relatively small patch of sky , multiple contiguous stamps are collected together to form a so - called super - stamp . in the original _ kepler _ field ,",
    "two such super - stamps were taken around the stellar clusters ngc  6791 and ngc  6819 .    in 2012 and 2013 , the failures of two reaction wheels that were used to maintain accurate , stable spacecraft pointing , forced nasa to re - design the mission .",
    "after a period of study and evaluation , nasa approved an extension to the mission ( named _ kepler_-2.0 , hereafter , _",
    "k2 _ , @xcite ) , essentially for as long as the two remaining reaction wheels continue to operate or until the fuel is exhausted .",
    "the mission was cleverly designed to use the radiation pressure from the sun to balance the spacecraft drift , allowing it to observe four fields per year close to the ecliptic .",
    "each of these fields corresponds to a so called _",
    "k2 _ campaign ] , and can be continuously observed for @xmath275 days .",
    "while the two functional reaction wheels control the pitch and yaw , the thruster needs to be fired every @xmath26 hours to control the roll angle of the field .",
    "this operation mode causes significantly larger jitter than in the original _ kepler _ main mission .",
    "therefore , although the _ k2 _ data collection procedures are similar to those adopted for the original _ kepler _ mission , the reduced pointing capabilities impose the adoption of 2 - 4 times larger target stamps .",
    "because the _ k2 _ stamps include 4 - 16 times more pixels , the number of observed targets is proportionally reduced from the @xmath2150000 targets of the original _ kepler _ field to @xmath210000 - 20000 objects for the various _",
    "k2 _ fields . a new list of target objects is defined for each campaign : the ecliptic plane input catalog ( hereafter , epic ) .    despite the changes introduced in _",
    "k2 _ mission ,",
    "several notable results have been achieved , from exoplanet discovery and characterization ( e.g. , @xcite ) to asteroseismology ( @xcite ) and stellar astrophysics ( @xcite ) .      in this study",
    "we apply our expertise on psf photometry and astrometry on dithered and undersampled images in crowded fields @xcite to extract high - precision photometry of stars in the two galactic open clusters ( ocs ) m35 and ngc  2158 , which happened to lie within the _ k2 _ campaign 0 ( c0 ) field .    the temporal sampling and coverage of _ kepler _ and",
    "_ k2 _ missions and their high photometric precision could be an invaluable resource for different stellar cluster fields , for example gyrochronology ( @xcite ) , stellar structure and evolution ( e.g. , age and helium content from detached eclipsing binaries as done by @xcite ) or asteroseismology membership ( @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting topic concerns exoplanets .",
    "we could improve our knowledge about the exoplanets in star clusters , in particular on how the environment ( chemical composition , stellar density , dynamical interaction ) can affect their formation , evolution and frequency ( @xcite ) .    until now , most of the published studies based on _ kepler _ and _ k2 _ data have focused on isolated , bright objects . focusing on _ k2 _ data , photometry on such bright objects is well described in the literature . the main difference between the methods concern the mask determination , the stellar centroid measurement and the subsequent detrending algorithms to improve the photometric precision ( for a review of the _ k2 _ methods adopted by the different teams , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the potential scientific information on faint objects and on stars in the super - stamp crowded regions has not been completely exploited .    in this paper",
    "we intend to obtain the most accurate possible models for the _ kepler _ psfs and to use them to explore the light curves ( lcs ) of the sources in the densest regions that have been and will be imaged by _",
    "kepler _ and _ k2_. the _ kepler _ main mission includes 4 ocs ( ngc  6791 , ngc  6811 , ngc  6819 , ngc  6866 ) ; many more clusters have been and will be observed during the _ k2 _ campaigns , which will also include the galactic center and the bulge ( campaign 7 and 9 , respectively ) .    thanks to our psf models , for the first time on _ kepler _ images , it will be possible to obtain precise photometry for stars in crowded fields , and down to @xmath0@xmath224 .",
    "having access to accurate _",
    "kepler _ psfs and comprehensive catalogues from high - angular - resolution ground - based imaging allows us to subtract neighbours before measuring the flux of target stars , thus giving us better corrections for dilution effects that might result in under - estimates of the true radius of transiting / eclipsing objects .",
    "indeed , the combination of psfs and catalogues allow _ all _ reasonably bright sources within the stamps to be measured accurately .",
    "finally , even without ground - based imaging , accurate psfs , combined with aperture photometry , will allow better identification of blends .",
    "we will illustrate a few examples of mismatched variables in the epic catalogue , showing that the real variable is a different , much fainter source ( see sect .  [ rmslit ] ) .",
    "this pilot paper makes exclusively use of pixels within channel 81 and collected during _ k2 _ campaign 0 , focusing on the ocs m35 and ngc  2158 .",
    "we downloaded all the _",
    "tpfs , which contain the complete time series data , for both these clusters from the `` mikulski archive for space telescopes '' ( mast ) . in our approach",
    "we find it more convenient to work with reconstructed images of the entire channel , putting all saved pixels into a common reference frame , rather than working with separate stamps .",
    "this gives us a better sense of the astronomical scene and enables us to work with all pixels collected at a same epoch in a more intuitive way .",
    "we assigned a flag value to all pixels in the ccd unsaved in any stamp .",
    "we wrote a specialized ` python ` routine to construct an image for each cadence number of the tpfs and the corresponding _ kepler _ barycentric julian day ( kbjd ) was defined as the average kbjd of all the tpfs with the same cadence number . for c0 channel 81",
    "we thus reconstructed a total of 2422 usable images .",
    "each channel-81 image is a 1132@xmath41070 pixel@xmath6 array .",
    "the value assigned to each pixel in each image is given by the ` flux ` column of the corresponding tpf .",
    "to cross - check that the reconstructed images were correct , we compared them with full - frame images of the field ( which were also available from the mast ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] gives an overview of our data set .",
    "we show the coverage and the resolution the _ k2 _ stacked image obtained with 2422 images and the schmidt stacked image from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see sect .",
    "[ aic ] for the description of the catalogue and its usage ) .",
    "even taking into account the large defocusing of the _ kepler _ camera , its psfs are still undersampled . indeed , _",
    "psfs are not simple 2-dimensional gaussians , and several of the psf s fine - structure features are severely undersampled",
    ". if not correctly modeled , these substructures can introduce sources of systematic errors into the measurement of the positions and fluxes of the studied sources .",
    "furthermore , if a psf model is not sufficiently accurate , any attempted neighbour - subtraction results in spurious residuals and consequent systematic errors .",
    "@xcite , hereafter ak00 , introduce a convenient formalism to model the psf .",
    "rather than model the _ instrumental _ psf as it impacts the pixels , they model the _ effective _ pixel - convolved psf ( epsf ) in a purely empirical way using a simple look - up table formalism .",
    "their psf is similar to the _ pixel response function _ ( prf ) described in @xcite .",
    "one of the issues that ak00 found in modeling the undersampled _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ )",
    "wfpc2 psf is that such psfs suffer from a degeneracy between the positions and the fluxes of the point sources .",
    "an appropriate calibration data set where stars are observed in different pixels of the detector and maps different sub - regions of the pixels is required to solve for this issue .",
    "the ak00 approach involves taking a dithered set of exposures and empirically constructing a self - consistent set of star positions and a well - sampled psf model that describes the distribution of light in the pixels .",
    "such a data set was taken for _ kepler _ during _ kepler _ s early commissioning phase ( see @xcite for a description ) , but unfortunately it has not yet been made available to the public ( though it may be within a few months according to thomas barclay , private communication ) .    given the urgent need for psfs to make optimal use of the _ k2 _ data , we decided to do the next best thing to construct an accurate set of star positions , so that properly sampled psfs can be extracted from _ kepler _ images .",
    "the main - mission _ kepler _ data are not suitable for this , since they have very little dither and each star provides only one sampling of the psf .",
    "the _ k2 _ data are actually better for psf reconstruction purposes , since the loss of the reaction wheels means that the spacecraft is no longer able to keep a stable pointing .",
    "every @xmath26.5 h , a thruster jet is fired to re - center the boresight position to its nominal position . as a consequence , the stellar positions continuously change during _ k2 _",
    "observations , with each star sampling a variety of locations within its central few pixels .",
    "moreover , channel 81 contains the large super - stamp covering m35 and ngc  2158 ( our main targets ) with a large number of high signal - to - noise ( snr ) point sources .",
    "we will see in the next sections that this mapping is not optimal , but it is the best available so far .",
    "the complicated drift - and - repositioning process inherent in the _ k2 _ data collection results in a very uneven sampling of each star in pixel phase . ] .",
    "there are many observations at the initial phase , and few at the latter phases .",
    "we note that even with the repeated drift , a star typically samples its pixels along a line , rather than evenly across the face of a pixel , so even the achieved dither is less than ideal . in order to make the dither sampling as even as possible , we selected a subset of images ( out of the 2422 exposures described in the previous section ) in order to evenly map the astronomical scene across pixel phases . to do this",
    ", we used the _ empirical _ approach of @xcite to construct an initial psf model that was spatially constant across each detector .",
    "such a psf is not ideal for our ultimate purposes , but it provides better positions than a crude centroid approach and will allow us to identify a subset of images that can be used to extract the best possible psf .    for each exposure",
    ", we made one empirical - psf model for the entire channel because most of the stars are located in the m35/ngc  2158 super - stamp and the spatial variability is not significant for this initial purpose .",
    "with such psfs , we were able to measure positions and fluxes for all sources .",
    "we then built a common reference system ( hereafter master frame ) by cross - identifying the stars in each image .",
    "we used six - parameter linear transformations to bring the stellar positions as measured in each exposure into the reference system of the master frame . at the first iteration",
    ", the master frame was chosen using as reference one of the exposures of our sample .",
    "we then adopted a clipped - average of the single - frame positions transformed into the master frame in order to improve the definition of the master frame itself , and re - derived improved transformations .",
    "this process was iterated until the master - frame positions did not significantly change from one iteration to the next",
    ".    the transformations between each frame and the master frame allowed us to analyze the dither - pattern . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show this pattern along with its time evolution .",
    "the dither pattern was made by transforming the same pixel in each exposure into the master - frame reference system .",
    "since the behaviour of the geometric distortion is different along the detector , the dither - pattern outline can change using a different pixel .",
    "however , for our purpose , such representation allows us to understand it anyway .",
    "it is clear that the dithering places the same star at a range of locations in its central pixels . while the dither coverage along the @xmath7 axis is reasonably uniform , along the @xmath8 axis the bulk of the 2422 exposures",
    "is located in a narrow area .",
    "we constructed a homogeneous mapping of the pixel - phase space ( bottom - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) as follows .",
    "we divided the pixel - phase space in a 5@xmath45-grid elements and , in each element , we selected by hand six exposures in order to include that sub - pixel region in our psf construction .",
    "this was possible in almost all the cells .",
    "we ended up with 154 images out of 2422 .",
    "this is a compromise between the need to have an adequate number of samplings for the epsf , and the necessity to map the entire pixel space homogeneously , avoiding over - weighting of any sub - pixel region ( by using the whole data set which is very heterogeneous ) .      with this subset of images , we were finally able to construct a reliable psf model .",
    "for all exposures , we assumed the psf to be spatially constant within our super - stamps , and to have no temporal variations .",
    "for a given star of total flux @xmath9 located at the position ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) , the value of a given pixel @xmath12 close to such star is defined as :",
    "= -2 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the local sky background and @xmath15 is the psf , defined as the fraction of light that would be recorded by a pixel offset by @xmath16 from the center of the star . by fitting the psf to an array of pixels for each star in each exposure , we can estimate its @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath9 for each observation of each star .",
    "the equation to be used to solve for the psf can be obtained by inverting the above equation : = -2 @xmath17 with knowledge of the flux and position of each star in each exposure , each pixel in its vicinity constitutes a sampling of the psf at one point in its two - dimensional domain .",
    "the many images of stars , each centered at a different location within its central pixel , give us a great number of point - samplings and enable us to construct a reliable epsf model .",
    "this is described in detail in ak00 . here",
    ", we just provide a brief overview of the key points : + @xmath18 we made a common master frame by cross - identifying bright , isolated1-pixel square on a _",
    "k2 _ exposure there could be more than one star , as we will see in the fig .",
    "[ fig20 ] . therefore by `` isolated '' we mean that , in the _ k2 _ image , there are not other obvious stars close to the target . ] stars in each image and computing their clipped - averaged positions and flux . on average",
    ", we have 650 good stars per exposure to use",
    ". + @xmath18 we transformed these average master - frame positions back into the frame of each image in order to place the samplings more accurately within the psf domain ( since each measure is an average of 154 images ) .",
    "+ @xmath18 we converted each pixel value in the vicinity of a given star in a given image into an epsf sampling , and modeled the variation of the psf across its 2-dimensional domain .",
    "we have on average 650 reliable stars per exposure , for a total of 10@xmath19 samplings . + @xmath18",
    "the available epsf was used to measure an improved position and flux for the stars in each image .",
    "+ the whole procedure was iterated fifteen times , after which we noticed that the overall improvements were negligible ( i.e. , the pixel - phase errors did not change from one iteration to the next ) .",
    "the final epsf was a 21@xmath421 array of points that maps the 5@xmath45-pixel region around a star ( as in ak00 , our epsf model was supersampled by a factor 4 ) .        in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , we show the result of our procedure . at the beginning , the epsf sampling is not homogeneous and the shape of the epsf is not well constrained . even in the second iteration ,",
    "the sampling began to improve and the epsf became smoother .",
    "the same behavior can be seen in the pixel - phase errors .",
    "note that the pixel - phase errors appear to be behaved along the @xmath8 axes rather than the @xmath7 axes .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the available pixel - phase sampling simply allows us to see the errors in @xmath7 better than those in @xmath8 .",
    "again , when the _ kepler _ psf - characterization data set becomes public , it will allow for a much better characterization and verification of the psf .",
    "following a suggestion by the referee , we investigated whether our _ k2_/c0 epsf is broader than the _ kepler_-main - mission prf ( @xcite ) .",
    "the broadening is expected because of the _ k2 _ pointing jitters larger than those in the main mission .",
    "we measured the full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the five channel-81 prfs ( one for each corner and one for the central region of the ccd ) and that of our average epsf along different directions . in fig .",
    "[ figpsfcomp ] , we show a contour representation of our epsf and the central prf of @xcite . the epsf size in these representation is the same as for the prf ( in _ kepler _ pixels ) .",
    "our epsf is limited to a small region around the center and do not model the epsf wings , as the crowding in the studied super - stamp does not allow the modeling of the epsf wings . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figpsfcomp ] we show the median fwhm values for the prfs / epsf .",
    "we found that our _ k2_/c0 epsf is broader than the _ kepler_-main - mission prfs .",
    "the basic assumption of the original ak00 method is that the epsf is constant in time and identical for all the images .",
    "this is of course an ideal condition and at some level it is never the case ; surely not for the _ hst _ nor for any other instrument we have used .",
    "there are also other subtle effects .",
    "the selection of a uniformly - distributed subsample of images in pixel - phase space could have introduced some biases .",
    "for example , some of the dither pointings in the less - populated regions of the pixel - phase space could have been taken while the telescope was still in motion , resulting in a more `` trailed '' epsf than the average epsf . in any case , as a working hypothesis , and having detected no obvious trailed images in the subsample that we selected for the epsf determination , we proceeded under the approximation that these effects are not larger than the general , epsf variations as a function of time .",
    "indeed , the shape of the _ kepler _ epsf clearly changes over time , as one can infer in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] from the vertical broadening of the epsf around the center ( rightmost middle and bottom panels ) .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] illustrates the temporal variation of the psf .",
    "we colour - coded the samplings of the final epsf ( top panels ) according to the epoch of observation ( see bottom panel ) .",
    "there are clear trends that are not simply monotonic .    in order to suppress as much as possible the impact of the temporal dependencies of the epsf we introduced a perturbation of the average epsf .",
    "this perturbation of the epsf was first described in @xcite , and can be summarized as follows .",
    "in each image , we fit and subtracted the current epsf model to high snr stars .",
    "we then modeled ( with a look - up table ) the normalized residuals of these epsf fits and added these tabulated residuals to the initial epsf to obtain an improved epsf model ( for a more recent application and a detailed description of the method see @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show an example of the time - variation adjustments of the average epsf for two images .",
    "the improvements in position and flux of the perturbed epsfs over a constant epsf for all the 2422 images are quantified in fig .",
    "we measured position and flux of all sources in each exposure with and without perturbing the epsf .",
    "the psf - fit process ( a least - square fit ) is achieved with a program similar to the ` img2xym_wfi ` described in @xcite that measure all sources , from the brightest to the faintest ( up to a minimum - detection threshold set by the user ) objects , in seven iterations . from the second iteration",
    "ahead , the fitting procedure is also performed on neighbour - subtracted images , in order to converge on reliable positions and fluxes for close - by objects .",
    "we then made two master frames , one for each of the two different approaches , by cross - identifying the stars in each of our 2422 images .",
    "we computed the 3@xmath20-clipped median value of the following quantities : , the 1d positional rms , and the photometric rms .",
    "these values were calculated in 1-magnitude bins and , for an appropriate comparison , we used the same set of stars for the two samples . in most cases",
    ", we found that the difference between the use of perturbed or unperturbed epsf is not negligible . using the perturbed rather than",
    "the average epsf to measure position and flux of a star in an image improves the psf fit because the former is a representation of a star in that particular image , while the latter is the representation of a star averaged on the entire c0 .    in the following ,",
    "we assume that the spatial variation of the epsf across the super - stamp region in channel-81 detector where ngc  2158 and m35 are imaged is negligible , therefore we will use only one epsf model per image .",
    "a substantial improvement to the epsf will be achieved when the psf characterization data are made available , so that we can properly account for the spatial variability .",
    "the main purpose of this effort is to extract precise photometry from main - mission and _ k2_-mission pixel data for sources in crowded fields and at the faintest end .",
    "these two issues are very closely related , since each 4@xmath21@xmath44@xmath21 pixel includes many faint sources that we need to take into account . because of this crowding , classical aperture photometry has major obvious limitations .",
    "different authors showed that photometry on neighbour - subtracted images leads , on average , to a better photometric precision than on the original images ( see , e.g. , @xcite and reference therein ) . by subtracting a star s",
    "neighbours before measuring its flux , it is possible to avoid including ( or at least to reduce the impact of ) light that could contaminate the true flux of the target .",
    "the knowledge of positions and flux of all sources in the field is therefore fundamental to our approach .    in order to obtain the best photometric precision with _",
    "k2 _ data , we used the same method as described in @xcite to which we refer for a more detailed description .",
    "this method makes use of accurate psf models for each exposure and of a ( ground - based ) input list to disentangle from the flux of a given star the contribution of its close - by sources .",
    "the more complete the input list with all detectable objects in the field , the better will be the final result of the method .",
    "a corollary is also that the transformations of the input - list positions and fluxes into the individual - exposure reference system need to be known with high accuracy , as well as the psf , in order to subtract the neighbours as well as possible . in the following we provide the adopted key ingredients .    , using the same colour - codes for the time of image acquisition . ]",

    "percentile of the distribution around the median value divided by @xmath23 , with @xmath24 number of points .",
    "the instrumental magnitude in each single catalogue is defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the sum of the total counts under the fitted psf . since we used the column ` flux ` while building the full - frame channel images , these counts are actually fluxes ( for this reason we used the double quotes in the label ) .",
    "hereafter , we will omit the double quotes in the text . ]",
    "our input list is described in great detail in @xcite .",
    "it comes from a set of white - light ( i.e. , filterless ) observations collected at the asiago schmidt telescope .",
    "it includes 75935 objects . at variance with @xcite , we used all stars measured in white light , and not only those found in both white - light and @xmath27-filter lists ( see sect .",
    "3.5 of their paper ) .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to this catalogue as the _ asiago input catalogue _ , or aic , which is available at the `` exoplanet and stellar population group '' ( espg ) website .",
    "the aic was constructed by measuring the position and flux of each source found in the schmidt stacked image via psf fitting .",
    "this input list was then transformed into the photometric system of a reference image ( among those of the schmidt data set ) .",
    "the catalogue was purged for various artifacts , such as psf bumps and fake detections along the bleeding columns .",
    "the purging is not perfect and it is a compromise between excluding true , faint stars around bright objects , and including artifacts in the catalogue . of",
    "the 75935 sources included in the input list , @xmath277@xmath28 could be measured reasonably well with the _ k2 _ data set .",
    "the stacked schmidt image has higher angular resolution than the _ kepler_/_k2 _",
    "images , allowing us to locate faint sources whose flux could pollute the pixels of a nearby star .",
    "the relative astrometric accuracy of the aic is also sufficiently accurate to allow us to pinpoint a star in any given _",

    "details about the absolute astrometry , the stacked images , and other information of the aic can be found in @xcite .",
    "the procedure for lc extraction is the same as in @xcite and can be summarized as follows . for each star in the aic , hereafter `` target star '' , we computed six - parameter , local linear transformations to transform the aic position of the target into that of each individual _ k2 _ image . in order to compute the coefficients of the transformations , we used only bright , unsaturated , well - measured target s neighbours within a radius of 100 pixels ( target star excluded ) .",
    "if there were not at least 10 neighbour stars within such radius , we increased the searching area progressively , out to the whole field .",
    "local transformations were used to minimize the effect of the geometric distortion , since it does not vary significantly on small spatial scales .",
    "these reference stars were also used to transform the aic white - light magnitude of the target into the corresponding instrumental _",
    "k2 _ magnitude in each given exposure .",
    "the aic magnitudes in white light and our @xmath0 instrumental magnitudes are obtained from instruments with a rather similar total - transmission curve and , as a first approximation , we can safely use a simple zero - point as photometric transformation between aic and _ k2 _ photometric systems .",
    "we extracted the photometry from the original and from the neighbour - subtracted _",
    "k2 _ images .",
    "the neighbour - subtracted images were created by subtracting from the original images the flux - scaled perturbed epsf of all aic sources within a radius of 35 _ kepler _ pixels ( @xmath22.3 arcmin ) from the target star .",
    "we postpone the discussion about the quantitative improvements in the photometry by using neighbour - subtracted images instead of the original images to sect .",
    "[ photprecwwo ] .    on the neighbour - subtracted images ,",
    "the target flux of each aic object was measured using aperture photometry with four aperture sizes ( 1- , 3- , 5- and 10-pixel radius ) and using epsf - fit photometry . on the original images , we used only 3-pixel - aperture and epsf - fit photometry .",

    "in order to calibrate our the instrumental magnitudes we extracted from the individual _",
    "k2 _ exposures to the _ kepler _ magnitude system ( @xmath0 ) , we determined and applied a simple local zero - point . for each photometric approach ( 1- , 3- , 5- , 10-pixel aperture and psf ) , we made a catalogue with absolute positions from the aic and with magnitudes obtained from 3@xmath20-clipped median values of the _ k2 _ instrumental magnitudes as measured in each lc ( when available ) .",
    "we then cross - matched these catalogues with the epic obtained from the mast archive .",
    "we computed the zero points as the 3@xmath20-clipped median value of the difference between our magnitudes and the epic @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "we used only those bright , unsaturated stars that in our catalogue are within three magnitudes from the saturation and for which the @xmath0 magnitude in the epic was obtained from ` gri ' photometry .",
    "we chose this specific photometric method among the different methods adopted to compute the @xmath0 magnitude in the epic due to the larger number of sources in common between this epic subsample and our well - measured - star sample .",
    "as in @xcite and @xcite , the zero - points of our photometric methods we found are between 24.7 ( 1-pixel aperture ) and 25.3 ( the other photometric methods ) .",
    "the unstable spacecraft pointing results in a well - defined motion of the stars across the pixel grid .",
    "a combination of intra- and inter - pixel sensitivity variation leads to a correlation between this motion and the `` raw '' flux of each star that must be corrected in order to increase the _ k2 _ photometric accuracy and precision .",
    "different methods have been developed to correct such systematic effect , e.g. , the self - flat - fielding approach of , the gaussian process of @xcite or the simultaneous fit for all systematics of @xcite .    in order to detrend the lcs from the drift - induced effects",
    ", we took into account all usable channel-81 exposures collected during the entirety of c0 , including those taken during the first part of the campaign , when the fine guiding was still in progress ( which caused the stars to be shifted by up to 20 pixels from their average position , see fig .",

    "this is important , since the number of points to be used for the detrending increases , and it could also be useful to detect variable stars with periods of @xmath235 days ( the duration of the c0 after the second safe mode ) .",
    "briefly , our correction was performed by making a look - up table of corrections and applying it with simple bi - linear interpolation .",
    "an overview of our detrending approach is shown in fig .",

    ", we made a model of the raw lc trend , normalized by its median flux ( panel a ) , by applying a running - average filter with a window of @xmath210 hours .",
    "the model ( panel b ) was then subtracted from the raw lc with the aim of removing the intrinsic stellar variability . in this way",
    ", the model - subtracted lc ( panel c ) reflects the systematic effect originated from the motion of the spacecraft .",
    "the window size of the running - average filter was chosen as a compromise between our attempt of avoiding the removal of the positional trend and still being able to model short - period variables .",
    "each pixel into which a given star fell during the motion was divided into an array of 20@xmath420 square elements and , in each such element , we computed the 3.5@xmath20-clipped median of the model - subtracted lc flux .",
    "the grid is sketched in panel ( f ) and ( g ) of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . for any location on the ccd ,",
    "the correction was performed by applying a bi - linear interpolation between the surrounding four grid points .",
    "the correction was not always available , because for some grid elements there are not enough points to compute the correction . in these cases ,",
    "no correction was applied .",
    "the whole procedure was iterated three times , each time making an improved lc model by using the lc corrected with the available detrending solution . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we show the results of the final iteration of our procedure .",
    "panel ( e ) of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows a direct comparison of the folded lc before ( left ) and after ( right ) the correction .",
    "the rms is improved and allows us to see more details in the lc .",
    "one advantage of our lc - extraction method is a more robust position measurement . indeed , as described in sect .",
    "[ lc ] , we transformed the position of a target star as given in the aic into the corresponding image reference system by using a subset of close - by stars , target excluded , to compute the coefficients of the six - parameter linear transformations .",
    "the local - transformation approach reduces ( on average by a factor @xmath29 , where @xmath24 is the number of stars used ) most of the systematic effects that could harm the stellar positions ( e.g. , the uncorrected geometric distortion ) .",
    "the lc detrending is critical both to the removal of the spacecraft - related systematics that degrade the _ k2 _ photometric precision and to pushing _",
    "k2 _ performance as close as possible to that of the original _ kepler _ main mission . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we show the rms ( defined as the 3.5@xmath20-clipped 68.27@xmath30-percentile of the distribution about the median value of the points in the lc ) improvement after the detrending process for the 3-pixel - aperture and psf photometry on neighbour - subtracted images .",
    "the rms was calculated on the normalized lc , i.e. after the lc flux was divided by the 3.5@xmath20-clipped median value of all the flux measurements . as we will see in sub - section [ photprec3psf ] , these two photometric methods are the best - performing methods at the bright- and faint - end regime , respectively . the improvement is greater for bright stars , i.e. stars with high snr and better - constrained positions ; while for faint stars the effect is lost in the random noise .",
    "several lcs turned out to exhibit a periodic drop in their fluxes that we have not seen described anywhere .",
    "these drops are rather sharp and resemble boxy transits ; we illustrate them in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the period of this effect is @xmath22.04 days , and the drops last for exactly six images , for each of the non - interrupted sub - series within c0 .",
    "not all the stars in the affected images show the drop feature .",
    "we extensively investigated the affected and un - affected stars on individual _",
    "k2_/c0/channel-81 images and found that the effect could be column - related .",
    "the amount of drop in the flux is not always the same and it correlates with magnitude .",
    "we have not found any description of such an effect either in the _ kepler _ manual or in the literature .",
    "we suspect that it might be due to an over - correction in correspondence of mis - behaving columns .",
    "this over - correction might be the result of electronic activities related to the periodic momentum dump of the two remaining reaction wheels through thruster firings ; which happens every two days ( @xcite ) .",
    "for example , it could be a change in the reading rate .",
    "another possibility , discussed with the referee , is that this effect can be originated by a non - identical _ kepler_-pipeline processing of contiguous tpfs that can create some un - physical discontinuity .",
    "such 2.04-d periodic effect could only be detected when dealing with more than one tpf at a time , as we did in our reconstructed - image approach .",
    "lacking more engineering data and detailed knowledge of the on - board pre - reduction pipeline , we have limited ourselves to simply describing and correcting these effects empirically .",
    "we first made a model of the lc trend ( by applying a running - average filter with a window of @xmath26 hours ) and computed the median value of the model - subtracted lc flux for affected and un - affected data points .",
    "if the difference between these median values was greater than the model - subtracted lc rms ( computed using only the un - affected points ) , we marked the lc as flux - drop - affected , and corrected it .",
    "the correction to add is computed as the difference between the model of the lc with only the un - affected points and the model obtained using only the flux - drop - affected points ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the drawback of our correction is obviously that any true variable star with a significant flux drop every 2.04 days was considered as flux - drop affected and corrected accordingly .",
    "of course , since this flux - drop is not periodic across safe - mode sub - series , it is possible to distinguish these events from true eclipses .",
    "the epsf is not only more suitable to performing photometry in crowded regions and for faint stars , but it can also be used as an additional diagnostic tool to discern among exposures that are most affected by some systematic effects , such as the drift motion of the spacecraft . in the following",
    "we show that , by taking advantage of all the information that we have from the epsfs adjusted for each exposure , we can also select the best exposures ( that correspond to points in the lcs ) to search for variability ( sect  [ search ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , we show an outline of our best - exposure selection for a variable - candidate lc ( aic star # 9244 ) . it is well known that _",
    "k2_/c0 data contain a periodic , systematic effect every @xmath26 hours , related to the thurster - jet firings used to keep the roll - angle in position .",
    "indeed high snr stars show a well - defined periodic effect every @xmath20.2452 days ( and at its harmonics ) . in the top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] we show the hand - selected points in the phased lc with a period of @xmath20.2452 days , while in the top - right panel we show the corresponding location of such points during c0 . by phasing different lcs with this period",
    ", we noticed that there is one group of points ( red , solid triangles ) that is more scattered than the others .",
    "these points are associated with the thruster - jet events .",
    "the remaining points , marked with different colours and shapes , represent different portions of the lc .",
    "the less populated groups ( black , solid squares ) were taken during the first part of the campaign ; while the more populated clumps ( green dots ) were taken during the second part of the c0 .",
    "the remaining outliers ( azure , open circles ) are those points obtained during the coarse pointing of the spacecraft , flagged in the tpfs accordingly . in practice , we discarded all points corresponding to the first part of c0 , and the points collected during the thruster - jet events and coarse pointing .",
    "+ we found very good agreement between such point selection and the epsf ( middle - left panel ) peak and fwhm ( middle - right panel ) .",
    "for example , the exposures taken during a thruster - jet event have a less - peaked epsf because the exposure is blurred during the long - cadence integration time .",
    "hereafter , we use the adjective `` _ _ clean _ _ '' to define a lc based on the stable part on the second half of the campaign ( green points in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) .",
    "we run our variable star finding algorithms only on the clean lcs .",
    "we used three different parameters to help us to estimate the photometric precision :    * _ rms _ ( defined as in sect  [ detrend ] ) ; * _",
    "p2p rms_. the point - to - point rms ( p2p rms ) is defined as the 3.5@xmath20-clipped 68.27@xmath30-percentile of the distribution around the median value of the scatter ( the difference between two consecutive points ) ; * _ 6.5-hour rms_. the _",
    "6.5-hour rms _ is defined as follows .",
    "we processed each available lc with a 6.5-hour running - average filter , and then divided it in 13-point bins . for each bin , we computed the 3.5@xmath20-clipped rms and divided it by @xmath31 ( @xmath32 , with @xmath24 the number of points in each bin ) .",
    "the 6.5-hour rms is the median value of these rms measurements .",
    "all three parameters have been calculated on the normalized lc .",
    "our psf - based , neighbour - subtracted technique has been specifically developed to deal with crowded regions and faint stars .",
    "therefore , we expect substantial improvements with respect to what is in the literature in these two specific regimes . in the following , we will demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approach .          by subtracting stellar neighbours before measuring the flux of a given star , we can obtain performance comparable with that achieved by others in the literature , but in more crowded regions . in general , within a single 4@xmath44-arcsec@xmath6 pixel , there can be more than one source that contribute to the total flux .",
    "therefore , we expect the neighbour - subtraction method to be useful not only in stellar clusters or fields in the galactic bulge , but also in relatively - lower - density regions .    to demonstrate this assertion , we selected two samples of stars : a `` crowded '' , sample centered on ngc  2158 , and an `` isolated '' sample , that comes from five different regions where the stellar density is lower .",
    "the two samples contain the same number of sources .",
    "we computed the lc rms for a 3-pixel aperture and for psf photometry with and without subtracting stellar neighbours ( fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) .    without removing stellar neighbours",
    ", the light of close - by stars that falls within the aperture increases the target flux , alters the faint - end tail of the rms trend ( naturally , the problems becomes larger for larger apertures ) .",
    "the effect is more evident in crowded regions , in particular when using aperture photometry . for the 3-pixel aperture photometry , in the crowded region",
    "the limiting magnitude on the original images is @xmath3318 , to be compared with the @xmath3322 limiting magnitude in neighbour - subtracted images of the same field ( second - to - the - last panels in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) . in summary , in crowded regions , by using the neighbour - subtracted images , we obtained a more reliable stellar flux and gained about 4 @xmath34 magnitudes for the 3-pixel - aperture photometry .",
    "furthermore , for both aperture and psf photometry , we have a lower rms for the lcs , and the bulk of the lc - rms distribution as a function of magnitude looks sharper . in conclusion , hereafter we will consider only neighbour - subtracted lcs .      as expected , and as shown by @xcite for ground - based data , aperture photometry performs , on average , better on isolated , bright stars , while the psf photometry gives better results on faint stars .",
    "in table  [ tab : rms1 ] and [ tab : rms2 ] we list the rms values in part - per - million ( ppm ) for each of the five photometric methods we adopted .    as can be inferred from these tables , for bright stars , 3-pixel - aperture photometry shows , on average , lower rms than 5- and 10-pixel aperture photometry .",
    "the 1-pixel - aperture- and the psf - based photometry have almost the same trend in the faint star regime ( @xmath35 ) , with the 1-pixel aperture showing a slightly smaller rms for @xmath0@xmath3619 , while the psf photometry performs 2 - 3 times better on brighter stars . in the following discussion , for faint stars , we prefer to use psf rather than 1-pixel - aperture neighbour - subtracted photometry , although , on average , equivalent in terms of photometric scatter .    in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] we show a comparison between the psf and the 3-pixel aperture photometric methods .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath34@xmath3615.5 the psf photometry performs better than the 3-pixel aperture .    for bright stars ,",
    "the 3-pixel - aperture 6.5-hour rms is below 100 ppm between 10@xmath37@xmath0@xmath3714 , with a best value of about 30 ppm for stars with 11@xmath37@xmath0@xmath3712.5 . for stars brighter than @xmath34@xmath210 , the rms increases , mainly because we are working on heavily - saturated stars . in the faint - end regime , using psf photometry we obtained 6.5-hour rms 2 - 3 times better than using a 3-pixel - aperture photometry . at 18@xmath37@xmath0@xmath3719",
    "the 6.5-hour rms is about 2600 ppm .",
    "such precision allows us to detect a flux drop of a few hundredths of magnitude , i.e. , the lc dimming due to exoplanet candidate tr1 discovered by @xcite .",
    "we will further discuss this object in sect .",
    "[ tr1sect ] .    in conclusion , we find that even at the bright end our neighbour - subtracted technique allows us to obtain performance that is comparable to those in the literature .",
    "this is the case even though we are dealing with a more crowded region than most previous studies .      at present",
    ", there are a number of studies in literature that are focused on the campaign 0 data of _ k2_. here , we provide a comparison , both using the lc rms and through a visual inspection of the lcs , for the objects in common with previous published studies .    before making such a comparison ,",
    "we warn the reader about some aspects that should be taken into account in the following .",
    "a fair comparison should be made by comparing the single light curves point by point .",
    "unfortunately , thus far , no one has ever attempted to measure all stars in the entire super - stamps .",
    "rather it is more common practice to restrict the analysis to the outer parts of dense stamps , where the crowding is less severe .    that said",
    ", we do have several lcs from stars in common with various studies ; in the best case , we have 40 stars .",
    "furthermore , by simply comparing the rms given in the different papers , we could introduce some biases .",
    "for example , the rms in a given magnitude bin can be overestimated by the number of variable stars within that bin ; the methods adopted to compute the rms can be different ; there might be different calibration methods to transform `` raw '' magnitudes into the _ kepler _ photometric system . in the latter case",
    ", stars can fall in different magnitude bins in different papers .",
    "finally , our neighbour - subtracted lcs are less affected by neighbour - light contamination .",
    "as noticed above , the light pollution would result in a brighter lc , which would move the star into a brighter magnitude bin , and decrease its rms ( because of the higher number of counted photons ) .",

    "we computed the three rms as described above .",
    "the lcs from @xcite show , on average , a larger p2p and 6.5-hour rms than our lcs for the variable objects , but their p2p and 6.5-hour rms for non - variable stars was lower . while the former behavior was predictable , ( as reported by , their self - calibrated - flat - field approach works best on dwarfs rather than on highly - variable stars ) the latter trend was unexpected .",

    ", @xcite used a circular aperture that included several neighbour sources .",
    "for faint stars , the ad - hoc aperture that was designed to avoid light contamination works only partially , since the flux on the wings of the psf can still fall inside it .",
    "furthermore , for blended stars the adopted aperture mask included all of them and , finally , the epic catalog seems not complete enough . in either cases ,",
    "the total flux of the source is increased because of the contribution of the neighbours , resulting in an higher snr for the source ( with a consequent better poisson rms ) , but this does not correspond to the true snr of the individual target source . of course",
    ", we can not exclude that @xcite detrending algorithm works better , further improving the final rms .",
    "a larger sample of stars is required for a more conclusive comparison .",
    "we also found that at least two variable objects identified by @xcite were mismatched / blended , difficult for him to identify due to the limitations introduced by the epic ( bright , isolated objects ) and to the low resolution of the _ k2 _ images ( see next section ) .",
    "it is worth to mention that @xcite releases for each light curve a flag that marks the cadence number associated to a thruster - jet event .",

    "[ fig22 ] we phased the light curve with double the period .    in the phased lc , both eclipses have more a `` v''-like than a `` u''-like shape . if we also consider the location of tr1 in the cmd ( _ right _ panel of fig .",
    "[ fig22 ] ) , it appears more likely to be a binary with a grazing eclipse rather than a transiting exoplanet candidate . in a future paper of this series",
    "we will make use of the input list from _ hst _ data to better characterize tr1 .",
    "we will also better determine the lcs for the subsample of stars that fall within the acs / wfc footprint of the _ hst _ program go-10500 field .",
    "an important by - product of our method is that we can much - better measure the depth of the eclipses , since our transits are less diluted by the light coming from neighbour sources than other approaches .",
    "figure  [ fig23 ] shows a comparison between the detrended clean tr1 lcs with ( black points ) and without ( azure points ) tr1 neighbours .",
    "the uppermost lcs were those obtained with 3-pixel - aperture photometry , while those in the middle and in the bottom were extracted using the psf photometry .",
    "we phased these light curves with a period of @xmath24.73 d as in fig .",
    "[ fig22 ] . in the right panel",
    "we also binned the lcs with bins of 0.01 phase each and computed , within such each bin , the median and the 68.27@xmath30 percentile of the distribution around the median values .",
    "the 3-pixel - aperture - based lcs do not show any significant flux variation .",
    "the median magnitude is three magnitudes brighter and the rms is smaller than in the psf - based lcs ; all evidences of neighbour - light contamination as discussed in sect .",
    "[ photprec ] .",
    "this lc represents the result of a classic approach found in the literature .",
    "on the other hand , the remaining psf - based lcs with ( hereafter wlc ) and without ( w / olc ) neighbours clearly present at least one flux drop . first of all , tr1 in the wlc is about 0.25 magnitudes brighter than in the w / olc .",
    "the w / olc does not only show a smaller rms and fewer outliers , but it shows two distinct eclipses ; while the wlc exhibits only the eclipse around phase @xmath20.2 .",
    "using ` vartools ` bls and ` exofast ` suit ( @xcite , assuming tr1 is a transiting exoplanet ) , we estimated a tr1 eclipse depth on the w / olc ( assuming the original bls period of @xmath22.36 days ) of about 3.2% and 3.4% , respectively . taking into account ( 1 ) that our lc and that of @xcite are obtained from different pass - bands , ( 2 ) the measurement errors , ( 3 ) the _ k2 _ integration time lasts half an hour , and ( 4 ) the incompleteness of the aic , we conclude that the two values are in rather good agreement .",
    "therefore , we confirm that our psf - based approach is effective in disentangling blended sources in crowded regions .",
    "we conclude this section remarking that it would have been simply impossible to extract the light curve of tr1 from _",
    "kepler_/_k2 _ data without using a input list from an higher resolution data set and subtracting the stellar neighbours .",

    "the test - beds for our method were super - stamps covering the ocs m35 and ngc  2158 .",
    "though the lack of _ kepler _ calibration data  not made available yet to the community  prevented us to optimize our algorithm , based on a technique we have developed in the last 20 years on _ hst _ undersampled images , we nevertheless succeeded in implementing a photometric procedure based on the epsf concept @xcite .",
    "we have shown that by using a crude psf that is spatially constant across the channel and allowing for simple temporal variations , we were able to properly fit stellar objects .",
    "future efforts will be devoted to further improve the psf model , possibly with a better data set at our disposal .",
    "in the second part of the paper , we focused our attention on the light - curve - extraction method and on the consequent detrending algorithms .",
    "the lc extraction is based on the methods we started to develop in @xcite and makes use of both psf fitting and of an high - angular - resolution input list to subtract stellar neighbours before measuring the stellar flux of any given target . by subtracting the light of the close - by stars , we are able to decrease the dilution effects that significantly impact the photometry in crowded regions",
    ".    we compared aperture- and psf - based photometric methods and found that aperture photometry performs better on isolated , bright stars ( 6.5-hour - rms best value of @xmath230 ppm ) , while psf photometry shows a considerable improvement with respect to the classical aperture photometry on faint stars and in crowded regions .",
    "the extension of the capability to exploit _ kepler _ as well as _",
    "k2 _ data set to fainter ( up to 5 magnitudes fainter than what has been done up to now in the literature ) stars and crowded environments is the main and original contribution of our efforts .",
