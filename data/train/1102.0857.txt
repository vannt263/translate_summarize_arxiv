    "this value increases linearly with the mass of the planet , but we are still in the linear regime even if we have a close - binary perturber , which indicates that linearity is likely to be a good approximation in the launching region ( and throughout the rz , except for the central regions ) .",

    "however , this value is found to vary by only a factor of 5 throughout the range of main - sequence stars in our study , for a given orbit .",
    "as the star evolves on the main - sequence , the position of the interface @xmath218 moves inwards towards higher density material , which slightly increases @xmath99 .",

    "the dominant mechanism of tidal dissipation in these stars is therefore likely to be damping of the equilibrium tide by turbulent convection .",
    "this is likely to be relatively inefficient for these periods , since the turbulent viscosity must be reduced when the orbital period is shorter than the convective timescale ( see e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . this could be an important explanation for the survival of these planets .",
    "this mechanism can also explain why the most massive short - period planets ( which still have smaller or comparable moments of inertia in the orbit as the rz of the star ) , such as wasp-18 b @xcite , wasp-14 b @xcite or corot-14 b , are exclusively found around f - stars , which have convective cores , and in which critical layer formation induced by wave breaking at the centre is unable to operate .",
    "in addition , these stars have been found to have weaker tidal dissipation in their outer czs than g - stars @xcite .",
    "note , however , that planets with much larger masses may have sufficient orbital angular momentum to be able to synchronise their stars and reach an approximate tidal equilibrium state , neglecting stellar magnetic braking , which would prevent orbital decay ( e.g.  @xcite ) , even for planets in orbit around a solar - type star .",

    "nevertheless , these waves are found to reflect approximately perfectly for moderate - amplitudes , a result which we have qualitatively confirmed in numerical simulations of moderate - amplitude tidal forcing .",
    "the general picture for high - amplitude forcing is that igws break within the innermost wavelengths of a star , if they reach the centre with sufficient amplitude to overturn the stratification . if this occurs , they form a critical layer , which we have confirmed from the simulations efficiently absorbs ingoing wave angular momentum .",
    "this results in the star being spun up to the orbital angular frequency of the planet , from the inside out",
    ". this could be very important to the survival of massive planets in short - period orbits around solar - type stars .",
    "one noticeable difference in 3d is that the absorption of @xmath74 ingoing waves results in the formation of latitudinal differential rotation .",

    "this allowed us to outline a possible explanation for the survival of all short - period extrasolar planets , that is not in conflict with current observations , and makes predictions which will be tested by ongoing observational studies such as wasp and kepler .",
    "as in bo10 , our simulations do not show any instabilities that act on the waves when they have insufficient amplitude to overturn the stratification .",
    "this result suggests that to obtain any efficient tidal dissipation , the waves must have sufficient amplitude to satisfy eq .",
    "[ breakingcriterion ] , so that they overturn the stratification .",

    "a detailed stability analysis of the 2d exact wave solution written down in bo10 is ongoing , and should shed light on this matter .    in our explanation in the previous section , we ignored the potential effects of the evolution of either the stellar eigenfrequencies or the tidal frequency , that could result in a passage through a resonance with a global mode of oscillation . if this occurs , and simple estimates suggest that this is very likely at least once in the lifetime of a system , then the waves may break , even if the amplitude of the tide is small before the passage through resonance .",
    "future work is required to study this problem in detail .",
    "the simulations performed in this paper used a boussinesq - type model , which is only valid in the central @xmath228 by radius of a solar - type star . for future work , it is possible to perform simulations using an anelastic code , which could take into account the radial variation in stellar properties throughout the whole rz ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we have also neglected the rotation ( or possible differential rotation ) of the rz , which is reasonable since we are considering the waves excited by short - period planets in slowly rotating stars .",
    "however , the inclusion of rotation ( and differential rotation ) would certainly be interesting to study for more rapidly rotating stars .",
    "one consequence could be that the latitudinal differential rotation observed in the simulations in 3d may be enhanced by rotation , because inertia - gravity waves can be confined in the equatorial regions .",
    "in addition , we have so far considered a planet on a circular , coplanar orbit . since",

    "the simulation variables and iw / ow solutions are plotted using this method in figs .",
    "[ 256lam15fr01t49ainaout ] and [ 256lam15fr1t45ainaout ] . comparing the reconstructed solution with the simulation data allows us to check whether the deconstruction has worked .",
    "in this section , we adopt the notation of ol04 , to avoid reproducing the results in that paper , since we are simply extending the results of their  4.4 . in the launching region , we want to match the solutions of the rz and cz . near the boundary @xmath254 , we assume @xmath255 , where @xmath256 , for the moment left unspecified .",
    "the characteristic radial extent of the transition region is of order @xmath257 , where @xmath258 , and @xmath93 is the ratio of the spin frequency to the dynamical frequency , which is much smaller than unity for slowly rotating bodies . we write @xmath259 where @xmath250 is an inner variable , which is of order unity in the launching region .",
    "we can write @xmath260 where @xmath261 .",
    "if we pose the perturbation expansions @xmath262 then we obtain the linearised system of equations 111 - 116 from ol04 , except that we replace @xmath250 by @xmath263 in the buoyancy equation ( eq .  115 ) .",
    "a linearised equation for the modified pressure ( @xmath264 ) in the launching region can now be derived , for which @xmath265 where all coefficients are evaluated at @xmath254 .",
    "this equation can be solved using the separation of variables @xmath266 the operator @xmath267 contains only angular derivatives , and @xmath268 , where @xmath269 , and @xmath2 is the wkb wavenumber of the waves .",
    "we thus obtain the equation @xmath270 where we have defined @xmath271 , and the length scale @xmath272 in the text this lengthscale is referred to as @xmath193 .",
    "the solution of this equation can be written down as a linear combination of bessel functions of the first and second kinds , of order @xmath273 : @xmath274 so that the complete solution in the transition region is @xmath275 this solution should match onto the wkb solution in the rz when @xmath276 , constraining @xmath277 as a function of @xmath278 .",
    "this arises from considering the asymptotic form of the phase at large @xmath109 , whose radial derivative should match the wkb wavenumber in the rz . from this",
    "we find @xmath279 .",
    "if we from now on restrict ourselves to @xmath280 , then the corresponding complete solution in the transition region is the sum @xmath281 similarly we can write the radial displacement as @xmath282 for a superposition of wave solutions in this model .",
    "deep in the rz , our solution should reduce to a wave with an inwardly directed group velocity , for which @xmath283 ( sign depending on that of the frequency ) .",
    "the asymptotic forms of the radial part of this solution at large @xmath109 is @xmath284 matching of @xmath285 at @xmath254 requires the solution in the cz to be continuous with the solution in the transition region at @xmath286 .",
    "this determinines the amplitudes @xmath287 .",
    "the inward energy flux in ( inertia-)gravity waves is found from evaluating @xmath288r^{2}\\sin \\theta d\\theta \\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\epsilon^{\\frac{19}{5 } } \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{5}}\\pi^{2}}{\\left[\\gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\right]^{2 } } \\rho_{0 } \\omega_{(1)}\\mathrm{sgn}(\\hat{\\omega})\\left(\\frac{r^{2}}{\\mathcal{d}}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{5 } } \\\\ & & \\times\\sum_{i}\\lambda_{i}^{\\frac{3}{5 } } \\frac{\\vert\\int_{0}^{\\pi}w_{i}^{*}\\left[\\check{w}(r_{b},\\theta)-\\bar{w}^{(p)}\\right]\\sin \\theta d \\theta\\vert^{2}}{\\int_{0}^{\\pi}|w_{i}|^{2}\\sin\\theta d\\theta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be compared with ol04 eq .",
    "we find in general that @xmath289 .",
    "thus we see that the main change in the energy flux from modifying the profile of @xmath168 in the transition region is to change its frequency dependence .",
    "there are also @xmath290 changes to the numerical factors ."
