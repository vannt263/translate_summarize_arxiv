    "the complex problem of protein folding is typically interpreted in terms of a diffusive search through an effective , low - dimensional free energy landscape , where most of the countless degrees of freedom of the system have been integrated out .",
    "@xcite in this picture the effective diffusivity ( or friction ) arising from intrapeptide and peptide - solvent interactions as well as from orthogonal degrees of freedom varies considerably along the reaction coordinate ( rc ) .",
    "@xcite in general , the internal friction constitutes a major contribution to the friction , such that solvent viscous drag and solvent - peptide interactions are not the only mechanisms that govern protein kinetics .",
    "@xcite internal and solvent - induced friction processes may even be intimately connected as was demonstrated for the loop formation rate of unfolded peptides , where the strongly denaturing salt guanidine hydrochloride modifies internal friction by specific binding mechanisms .",
    "@xcite    the investigation of the salt - specific action on proteins in general ( hofmeister effects ) has a long history ,  @xcite but the underlying mechanisms are still under exploration . in a recent series of experiments , for example , it has been shown that even the simple cations sodium ( na@xmath1 ) and potassium ( k@xmath1 ) exhibit considerably different behavior in the interaction with protein surfaces , where na@xmath2 is favored over k@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite one apparent reason is the stronger attraction of sodium to acidic ( anionic ) surface groups , in particular to carbonyl and side chain carboxylate groups .",
    "while these static properties have received much attention lately ,  @xcite not much is known about their consequences to biomolecular kinetics .",
    "experimental hints have been given in studies of na@xmath1- and k@xmath1-specific polyglutamic acid aggregation kinetics ,  @xcite folding kinetics of halophilic ( salt - loving and very acidic ) proteins  @xcite or dna .",
    "@xcite however , a detailed molecular understanding of the ion - specific action on biomolecular folding and assembly kinetics is still lacking .    in particular for large concentrations ( @xmath3  m ) salt effects are pronounced , highly sequence and salt - type specific , and typically lead to changes in protein solubility , stability , and/or denaturation that result in the so - called hofmeister series for the precipitation of proteins .",
    "@xcite although an order of magnitude higher than at typical physiological conditions ( @xmath4  m ) , large salt concentrations play a central biochemical role in the broad field of protein crystallization ,  @xcite in food industry as fermentation additives ,  @xcite and for the function and stability of biotechnologically interesting halophilic ( salt - loving ) enzymes .",
    "@xcite additionally , the study of protein structures in solvents with high salinity solvents is instructive as salt - specific effects are amplified and , important from a computational perspective , can be sampled more efficiently in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , a popular tool nowadays for the theoretical study of protein folding , function , and stability .",

    "marqusee and baldwin also found that the simple salt nacl has a destabilizing effect on the @xmath0-helical configurations of these peptides .    indeed , in a recent explicit - water molecular dynamics ( md ) computer simulation@xcite the structural behavior of the oligopeptide ace - aeaaakeaaaka - nme , in the following named the ek peptide , has been explored in detail , and the stabilizing and destabilizing mechanisms in various highly concentrated aqueous electrolyte solutions have been identified . among those it has been found that sodium ( na@xmath2 )",
    "destabilizes the helical structure stronger than potassium ( k@xmath2 ) ; it was also previously recognized that the reason for the destabilization of the salt bridges and the secondary - structure forming hydrogen lies in the higher affinity of na@xmath2 to carboxylate and carbonyl groups . in a recent follow - up paper",

    "strongly salt - specific effects are found in the mean folding times , which can be attributed to the binding of individual ions to multiple , anionic peptide groups inducing transient cross - links between peptide fragments . in consequence ,",
    "not only equilibrium distributions of configurations are modified , but also new , slow time scales in the peptide s configurational mobility arise due to enhanced internal friction .",
    "salt effects are thus reflected in both modified free energy landscape and local changes of the effective diffusivity .",

    "since the destabilization seems to be overemphasized for nacl , we do not claim to be quantitative in our work , but focus on the discussion of the main effects and qualitative trends with the addition of salt ; we believe these to be insensitive to the particular force field and relevant for a variety of experimental observations .",
    "trajectory analysis is performed using the _ ptraj _ tool in the amber9.0 package .",
    "@xcite the helicity , i.e. , the @xmath0-helical fraction , is identified using the dssp method by kabsch and sander .",
    "@xcite we focus on one rc @xmath16 , which is defined as the root mean square distance from a fully helical reference structure ( i.e. , with helicity equals to one ) , averaged over all atoms of the peptide and which thus measures the deviation from the native state ; this quantity was previously found to act as an adequate dynamic rc in the salt - free case .",
    "@xcite we note that different choices of the reference structure were tested and resulted only in small differences in the energy landscapes , i.e. , local variations on the order of fractions of the thermal energy @xmath17 ; see the supporting information ( si ) for additional details .",

    "the amplitude @xmath39 should be chosen small enough in order not to drive the system out of the linear response regime and at the same time large enough to get good statistics .",
    "for a more detailed discussion we refer to previous work  @xcite and set the amplitude to @xmath40 .",
    "we then obtain the viscosity by calculating the average velocity profile of all particles .",

    "the periodic perturbation method yields the same results within a @xmath46 error range .",
    "compared to experimental values  @xcite the md simulation considerably overemphasizes the increase of the viscosity at this elevated salt concentration ; indeed , the viscosity was experimentally found to increase by only roughly 5% for kcl and 30 - 40 % for nacl and nai compared to pure water .",
    "this failure in describing the correct bulk viscosities of the electrolyte solutions must be attributed to inaccuracies in the force field .",

    "we assume that the stochastic time evolution of the probability @xmath48 of finding a configuration with rc value @xmath49 at time @xmath50 is described by the one - dimensional fokker - planck ( fp ) equation  @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the ( in general @xmath49-dependent ) diffusivity , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the free energy obtained by boltzmann - inversion of the time - averaged probability distribution @xmath55 .",

    "the total helicity decreases slightly from 62% to 55% . for the sodium salts , nacl and nai , the fully folded state at @xmath77 becomes metastable , and",

    "i.    in the nacl and nai salts the total helicity significantly decreases to about 39% and 34% , respectively .",
    "the main causes have been discovered before  @xcite and are twofold : firstly , specific na@xmath2-binding to the glutamic acid side chain carboxylates interferes with e@xmath81-k@xmath2 salt bridging , and secondly , the binding of cations to backbone carbonyls perturbs secondary - structure forming hydrogen bonds .",
    "@xcite in comparison to na@xmath2 , the specific binding of k@xmath2 is weak and kcl thus behaves less destabilizing .",

    "this leads to a partial wrapping of the oligomeric backbone around the ion . from a superficial inspection of our trajectories we find that these long - lived configurations involving tightly bound na@xmath2-ions can be stable on a @xmath85  1 - 10 ns time scale .",
    "representative simulation snapshots which are dynamically selected such that they exist for more than 2  ns are shown in fig .  4 : in panel ( a ) a sodium ion is bound and wrapped by the central part of the peptide , while the terminal parts exhibit partial helical turns . the bound sodium locks this structure on times up to several nanoseconds .",
    "similar long - lived situations are found , where two neighboring turns are correctly folded , while the rest of the peptide forms a loop around the cation , see fig .  4  ( b ) .",
    "often also the glutamic acid side chain is involved as displayed in figs .",
    "4  ( c ) and ( d ) where the cation not only binds to a backbone carbonyl but also to the headgroup of the e@xmath81 side chain . in all these situations",
    "the peptide is relatively compact with one or two turns correctly folded such that the relevant @xmath49-region of these states is between @xmath86 , where the helicity is mostly between @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( cf .",
    "2  ( b ) ) .",
    "configurations of this type have not or only rarely been found involving anions or a k@xmath2-ion , so that their existence must be attributed to the relatively strong binding of the na@xmath2 ion .",
    "the rigorous life - time analysis of the occurring configurations involving trapped ions is difficult to perform due to the variety and complexity of the somehow amorphous structures .",
    "we therefore resort to the analysis of cation binding times . in the inset to fig .  3 , we plot the binding time distribution @xmath89 of the cations k@xmath2 and na@xmath2 in the first solvation shell of carboxylates and carbonyls ( defined by the location of the first minimum in the cation rdfs in fig .  3 ) .",
    "while the distribution decays exponentially for k@xmath2 with a time constant of about 50 ps , we find a much slower , nonexponential behavior for na@xmath2 which can be best fitted by a stretched exponential of the form @xmath90 with @xmath91  ps and @xmath92 .",
    "this indicates that long binding times on the order of nanoseconds are indeed possible and corroborate the existence of trapped unfolded configurations in which peptide parts tightly wrap around the cation .",
    "we note that it is indeed well established that systems with multiple trapping or other manifestations of disorder can lead to anomalous kinetics.@xcite in our investigated systems , the appearance and magnitude of trapping is controlled by the nature of the ions .",
    "the observed stretched exponentials resemble the slow relaxation in glass - forming liquids .",
    "@xcite anomalous kinetics in peptide and protein dynamics have been indeed observed in simulations and experiments for certain dynamic variables or rcs ,  @xcite and obviously question the general validity of diffusive approaches to predict long time dynamics in protein folding .",
    "while this complex issue is still awaiting resolution we proceed in this work with the interpretation of helix folding in the framework of simple diffusion ; since the average folding / unfolding times ( @xmath93 ) are typically much larger then the ion binding times ( @xmath94 ) , we expect the long - term dynamics to be adequately described in terms of memoryless diffusion in a free energy landscape .",

    "[ tab1 ] . without salt",
    "the typical folding time is about @xmath97  ns in the region @xmath98 before it quickly drops down to 0 for @xmath49-values closely approaching @xmath77 . in kcl @xmath99 increases by a factor of about 2 , while the sodium salts lead to a considerable slowing down of folding by one order of magnitude .",
    "the unfolding times @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) , cf .",
    "5  ( b ) , show a bit less variation between the salts . without salt",
    "the typical unfolding time is about 30 - 40 ns while it may rise by a factor of 2 - 3 in nacl or kcl .",
    "note that for kcl the unfolding is considerably slower than in the salt - free case although the free energy landscape is very similar .    to get a grasp on the folding kinetics involving fewer helical turns we have also analyzed @xmath102 for @xmath103 ( folding by 1 or 2 turns to the 2-turn state ) and @xmath104 for @xmath105 ( unfolding by 1 turn to the 2-turn state ) , which are shown in fig .",
    "6  ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the folding times decrease by a factor of about 2 when compared to the @xmath106 folding , while the trends with salt remain the same , in particular a one order of magnitude slower folding in the sodium salts .",
    "unfolding times @xmath104 are relatively small and found between 3 - 7 ns .",
    "the variation between the salts is again less pronounced for unfolding when compared to the folding times and show a different ordering .",
    "note that the mean first passage times shown in figs .",
    "5 and 6 are in parts subject to substantial noise due to insufficient statistical sampling : for example , clear deviations from a monotonously increasing function ( expected for diffusive dynamics ) are observed in the kcl - folding times shown in fig.5  ( a ) ; this irregularity has its origin in an exceptionally long - lived ( relative to the full trajectory duration ) state of a specific peptide configuration in the kcl - time series in fig .  1 within the time range @xmath107 . without going too much into detail ,",
    "this specific configuration is characterized by two helical turns and the ace - cap being buried between the hydrophobic side chains of one lys and one ala side chain .",
    "this configuration ( not involving bound ions ) is found rather frequently in all trajectories but with typically much shorter life times .",
    "let us now turn to the interpretation of the mean folding times by the free energy @xmath56 and diffusivity profiles @xmath52 . for statistical reasons leading to the above mentioned anomalies",
    ", we have resolved the @xmath52 profile only by three @xmath49-regions distinguishing between the three states : 1 ) mainly full - helix , 2 ) one and two - turn states , and 3 ) mainly unfolded states .",
    "we assume that these states are separated by the @xmath49-values , where the average helicity is 2/3 and 1/3 in fig .  2 ( the salt - specific values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 being summarized in tab .",
    "although the resolution of @xmath52 is small we emphasize that it can almost quantitatively reproduce the folding and unfolding times plotted in figs .  5 and 6 .",
    "mean first passage times for folding and unfolding predicted by the fp equation involving salt - specific free energies and diffusivities are shown in the si .",

    "@xcite the inhomogeneities reflect variations of the multi - dimensional configurational mobility of the peptide projected onto the one - dimensional rc @xmath49 .",
    "note also the fact that both analysis methods yield estimates , which coincide within error bars ( the only exception being kcl for @xmath108 ) , by this clearly validating our approach . after including the salt a few significant changes to @xmath52 are visible within the large error bars : firstly , in the solution with sodium salts there is a moderate decrease of the effective diffusivity by 30 - 60% in the large @xmath49-region , @xmath108 , where the peptide is mostly unfolded .",
    "in contrast , with kcl the diffusivity seems to increase by 30 - 60% in the unfolded regions .",
    "secondly , a drastic drop in diffusivity is observed for all salts in the central region @xmath109 , where the peptide features one or two @xmath0-helical turns ; the decrease is about _",
    "one order of magnitude _ for the sodium salts nacl and nai .",
    "finally , we find a smaller decrease of the diffusivity again in the completely folded states @xmath110 , where the diffusion drops by about 30 - 60% for the kcl and nacl salts .",
    "thus , while no clear - cut trends in the change of the diffusivity profile with salt can be recognized , clearly the diffusivity mainly decreases with salt , along with a significant drop in the partially folded states in the intermediate @xmath49-region .",
    "importantly , the changes of @xmath52 with salt are obviously not just a rescaling of @xmath52 of the salt - free system as if the action would just stem from a nonspecific change due to a different bulk viscosity . in particular , the very few cases for which a viscosity argument applies could be for nacl and kcl in the low @xmath49-region , @xmath110 , or for nacl and nai in the high @xmath49-region , @xmath108 : here the diffusivity is reduced by a factor of 2 , roughly the same as for the viscosity increase ( see methods ) . since there is no general trend , however",
    ", we must conclude that the change of the diffusivity profile originates from a combination of bulk viscosity effects _ and _ specific cosolute binding to the peptide .",
    "we believe that viscosity effects may be more important in the large @xmath49-region than in the low @xmath49-region : while large scale coil rearrangements in the solvent are frequent in the former , changes along the rc are mainly governed by internal mechanisms in the latter case ; here only minor configurational rearrangements like the expulsion of one water molecule or one ion , or the forming and breaking of internal hydrogen - bonds take place . from this perspective",
    "it is interesting to see the diffusivity increasing in the high @xmath49-region for kcl , while from viscosity arguments only it should decrease by a factor of 2 .    however , given the diffusivity profiles in fig .",
    "7 , the large increase of folding times [ figs  5  ( a ) and 6  ( a ) ] for the sodium salts must thus be attributed not only to the changes in the free energy landscape but more dominantly , to the strongly reduced diffusivity in the intermediate @xmath49 -region , @xmath111 . the faster unfolding and the weaker dependence of unfolding vs. folding times on salt type ( cf .",
    "5  ( b ) and 6  ( b ) ) seems to arise from a cancellation effect , where the small mobility in the intermediate @xmath49-regions is counterbalanced by the low unfolding barriers in @xmath56 ( a comparison of the fp description for average folding and unfolding times with the raw data shown in fig .",
    "5 is given in the si . )",
    "what are the molecular reasons for the major changes in the diffusivity profiles in the electrolytes solutions ? based on our structural and ion binding analysis in the previous section it is now easy to argue that the huge drop in the effective diffusivity in the sodium salts is generated by the long - lived configurations similar to those shown in fig .",
    "the long - lived character of these conformations is clearly observed in trajectory analysis and also manifested in the long binding times of cations on a nanosecond time scale shown in fig .",
    "while the form of the free energy landscape does not care about the life time of these states ( just what fraction of time they are sampled ) , the long life times are clearly reflected in parts of the diffusivity profiles . due to the stronger binding of na@xmath2 vs. k@xmath2 to the peptide oxygen atoms the effect is much smaller in the kcl solution than for the sodium salts .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the specific effects of salt at molar concentration on the @xmath0-helical folding kinetics of a short , alanine - based and salt - bridge forming peptide by means of molecular simulations and a diffusional analysis .",
    "mean folding times have been found to considerably depend on salt type with folding times varying over one order of magnitude .",
    "the molecular reason is the previously observed stronger binding affinity of na@xmath2 vs. k@xmath2 ions to anionic peptide groups thereby transiently cross - linking multiple groups in the peptide .",
    "these binding processes increase the internal friction and induce a new , slow time scale . within an analysis in terms of an effective diffusivity in a one - dimensional free energy landscape ,",
    "these new time scales are expressed by a strong and salt - specific variation of the local diffusivity .",
    "a recent simulation study of a fully charged polyglutamic acid chain in salt solution showed that segmental relaxation kinetics were significantly slowed down due to the same molecular mechanisms .",
    "@xcite    the picture emerges that adsorption of ions not only alter the equilibrium but also kinetic properties of protein folding by direct binding mechanisms . whether a general relation between preferential adsorption  @xcite and changes in kinetics can be drawn may be an interesting notion for further research .",
    "given the current insights it seems likely , however , that the change in kinetics not only depends on the amount of adsorbed ions but on the individual ion - peptide interactions .",
    "as we have demonstrated , molecular simulations can provide valuable information to understand the complex mechanisms in solvent - protein interactions and thereby protein stability and folding .",
    "the molecular mechanism found may be of general importance to understand cosolute effects on protein folding kinetics and shed more light onto experimentally observed cation - specific slowing down of ( bio)poly - electrolyte kinetics ,  @xcite in particular , for halophilic proteins ;  @xcite similar mechanisms may be at work in polymer melts .",
    "@xcite more experimental studies are highly desirable ; in particular , the novel long - lived loop - forming configurations in the denatured / unfolded states , in which sodium or similarly strong binders are bound and immobilized by the peptide backbone , may be experimentally accessible by nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion methods ( nmrd)@xcite or time - resolved fret measurement@xcite probing salt - specific peptide relaxation and kinetics .",
    "furthermore , the action of complex denaturants such as guanidinium and urea deserve further attention , and systematic studies on specific salt effects should follow .",
    "the guanidinium cation , for instance , has been shown to decrease friction in neutral ( glyser)@xmath7 peptides .",
    "@xcite we expect also a strong influence of other specifically binding cations on anionic peptides , such as lithium , or polyvalent cations , such as mg@xmath112 or ca@xmath113 .",
    "large effects may also be anticipated by exchanging the anion that has been found to considerably alter the unfolding kinetics of a halophilic protein .",
