    "our results have impact on three fields : model theory , universal algebra , and theoretical computer science .",
    "we therefore have a three - fold introduction .      in model theory , reducts of a relational structure @xmath0",
    "are usually considered _ up to first - order interdefinability_. to be more precise , one considers the reducts of the expansion of @xmath0 by all first - order definable relations , and two reducts @xmath1 and @xmath2 are considered to be the same if and only if there is a first - order definition of @xmath1 in @xmath2 and vice versa .",
    "it is well - known that there is a close connection between classifications of reducts up to first - order interdefinability and the theory of infinite ( closed ) permutation groups . in 1976",
    ", cameron  @xcite showed that the highly set - transitive permutation groups are exactly the automorphism groups of the reducts of @xmath3 .",
    "he also showed that there are exactly five reducts of @xmath3 up to first - order interdefinability . recently ,",
    "junker and ziegler gave a new proof of this fact , and showed that @xmath4 , the expansion of @xmath3 by a constant @xmath5 , has 116 reducts  @xcite .",
    "thomas showed that the first - order theory of the random graph also has exactly five reducts  @xcite and conjectured that every structure with quantifier elimination in a finite relational signature has a finite number of reducts , up to first - order interdefinability .    in this article",
    ", we initiate the systematic study of reducts up to _ primitive positive interdefinability_. a first - order formula is _ primitive positive _ if and only if it is of the form @xmath6 for atomic formulas @xmath7 . clearly , classifications up to primitive positive interdefinability are harder to obtain , compared to first - order interdefinability , since there are far more reducts to distinguish .",
    "the simplest structure where such a classification can be studied is the structure that has no structure at all except for the equality relation , which is considered part of first - order logic .",
    "our result classifies the reducts of the structure @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a countably infinite set , up to primitive positive definability . while this might look trivial at first sight , we prove that the number of such reducts equals the continuum .",
    "it turns out that the partial order ( in fact , the lattice ) of these reducts is quite complex , but can be described reasonably well .",
    "we remark that the classification of the reducts of @xmath10 up to primitive positive interdefinability is the same as the classification for a structure of the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a set of arbitrary infinite cardinality .",
    "to show our classification result , we use a concept that is called _",
    "clone _ in universal algebra .",
    "clone _ is a set of operations on some fixed domain that is closed under compositions and contains all projections .",
    "the clones we are interested in are moreover _ locally closed _ , which means that they are , similarly to closed permutation groups used for the study of reducts up to first - order interdefinability , closed sets in the natural topology on the operations . for @xmath13-categorical structures @xmath0 , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the reducts of @xmath0 and the locally closed clones that contain the automorphisms of @xmath0 . in order to classify the reducts of @xmath10 , we thus classify those locally closed clones which contain all permutations of the domain .",
    "we believe that several of the results and techniques presented in this article can be used to also classify reducts of other @xmath13-categorical structures up to primitive positive definability .",
    "such future classifications are likely to combine existing results on first - order closed reducts , such as the above - mentioned results on the dense linear order and the random graph , with the results of the present paper .      for universal algebraists ,",
    "the title of our paper could be `` the locally closed clones above the permutations '' .",
    "in fact , in this article we describe the lattice of all locally closed clones on a countably infinite set that contain all permutations of this set .",
    "traditionally , most work on clones was done for clones on a finite domain , and only occasionally clones on infinite sets were studied .",
    "however recently , the use of methods from mathematical logic , in particular from set theory , has allowed for the production of a considerable number of new results on clones over infinite sets .",
    "classical results on clones , mostly on finite domains , can be found in the books @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , while the recent survey paper @xcite contains much of what is known on clones over infinite sets .",
    "the clones on a finite domain which contain all permutations were completely determined in @xcite ; it turns out that the number of such clones is finite .",
    "if one moves on to infinite domains , there are two possible clone lattices which can be considered : the lattice of local clones , which is closer to the clone lattice on a finite domain in both size and methodology that can be employed for its study , and the lattice of all clones , the investigation of which often involves set - theoretical constructions ( as in @xcite , for example ) .    in the full clone lattice over an infinite set , the interval of those clones which contain all permutations has been subject to investigation . for example , its dual atoms have been completely described on domains of regular cardinality ( @xcite , @xcite ) . moreover , its atoms were determined for all infinite domains in @xcite .",
    "however , the number of clones above the permutations has been shown to be huge ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and it seems unlikely that all such clones on an infinite set will ever be classified .",
    "as our results will show , the situation is quite different for local clones which contain the permutations .",
    "these clones had not yet been subject to explicit investigation and were largely unknown except for a few implicit results , such as partial results on local clones containing all unary operations in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that although the lattice of locally closed clones which contain the permutations is uncountable , one can obtain a reasonable understanding of it .",
    "we remark here that the lattice of all local clones has been shown to be quite complicated ; in particular , already on a countably infinite base set , the class of lattices which are completely embeddable into it properly contains the class of all algebraic lattices with a countable number of compact elements ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the satisfiability problem for propositional logic is one of the most fundamental problems in computer science , and among the hardest problems in the complexity class np .",
    "many restrictions of this problem stay np - hard ",
    "e.g. the problems not - all - equal-3sat and one - in-3-sat . in a groundbreaking paper in 1978 , schaefer studied a large class of natural restrictions of the satisfiability problem  @xcite . for a fixed structure @xmath0 over the boolean domain @xmath14 , the computational problem is to decide whether a given sentence of the form @xmath15 is true , where @xmath16 is of the form @xmath17 for a @xmath18-ary relation @xmath19 in @xmath0 .",
    "this problem is now known as csp@xmath20 , the _ constraint satisfaction problem _ for the _ constraint language _ @xmath0 .",
    "( it is easy to see that 3sat , not - all - equal-3sat , and one - in-3-sat can be modelled as csp@xmath20 for appropriate boolean constraint languages @xmath0 . )",
    "schaefer proved that for boolean constraint languages @xmath0 the problem csp@xmath20 can either be solved in polynomial time , or is np - complete , and he gave a complete description of the tractable and the hard boolean constraint languages .",
    "schaefer s theorem inspired many other complexity classification projects for computational problems that are ` parametrized ' by a constraint language , and similar results have been obtained not only for constraint satisfaction , but also for other computational tasks such as _ quantified constraint satisfaction _ , _ learning of propositional formulas _ , _ counting solutions _ , and the _ maximum solution problem_. it turns out that for all these computational problems the computational complexity does not change if we add relations to the constraint language @xmath0 that have a primitive positive definition in @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that the complexity of these problems only depends on the so - called _ clone _ consisting of all _ polymorphisms _ of the constraint language , i.e. , the set of those operations that preserve all relations in @xmath0 .",
    "the lattice of clones on a two - element set was determined already quite some time before schaefer , namely by post in 1941  @xcite . and indeed , schaefer s classification can be formulated in terms of post s lattice , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "our result can be viewed as an analog of post s lattice for the logic of equality ( rather than for propositional logic ) . in this analogy",
    ", boolean relations correspond to relations that have a first - order definition in @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is an arbitrary infinite set .",
    "sets of such relations have been called _ equality constraint languages _  @xcite . hence , in this paper we study the lattice of polymorphism clones of equality constraint languages .",
    "note that equality constraint languages are exactly those constraint languages that are preserved by all permutations of the domain ; in this sense , we study those constraint languages up to primitive positive interdefinability that have the maximal possible degree of symmetry .",
    "the constraint satisfaction problem for equality constraint languages has been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that csp@xmath20 is np - complete if the polymorphism clone of the constraint language is the smallest element in the lattice ; otherwise , it is polynomial - time solvable .",
    "the _ quantified constraint satisfaction problem ( qcsp ) _ for equality constraint languages @xmath0 has been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "we make the notions of the introduction precise , and fix some definitions and notation from logic and universal algebra .",
    "moreover , we explain how to translate our classification problem from logic to algebra and vice - versa : that is , we demonstrate in what way reducts correspond to local clones .",
    "consider the relational structure consisting of a countably infinite domain and the relation of equality only .",
    "for notational simplicity , we will assume that this domain is the set @xmath21 of natural numbers . by a _",
    "reduct _ of @xmath22 we mean a structure @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a set of finitary relations on @xmath21 all of which can be defined by a first - order formula in the language of equality .",
    "let @xmath25 be a first - order formula over the relational signature @xmath26 .",
    "then @xmath25 is called _ primitive positive _ or @xmath27 iff it is of the form @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are atomic @xmath26-formulas . for a set @xmath24 of relations on @xmath21 , we write @xmath30 for the set of all relations on @xmath21 which can be defined from @xmath24 by pp formulas ( over the signature appropriate for @xmath24 ) .",
    "we say that a structure @xmath31 is _ pp - definable _ from a structure @xmath32 iff @xmath33 .",

    "iff @xmath36 .",
    "the notion of pp - definability imposes a quasiorder on the reducts of @xmath37 , and the relation of pp - interdefinability is an equivalence relation on this order .",
    "we are interested in the partial order which is obtained by factoring the quasiorder of reducts by this equivalence relation .",
    "that is , we consider two reducts the same iff they are pp - interdefinable , or equivalently , we consider the partial order of pp - closed reducts .",
    "in fact , the pp - closed reducts form a complete lattice , where the meet of a family of structures @xmath38 is the structure @xmath39 , and the join is @xmath40 .",
