    "the energy spectrum of free electrons in a perfect quantum wire without spin - orbit interaction consists of spin - degenerate subbands due to the transverse confinement in two directions . in each subband",
    ", the energy depends quadratically on the one - dimensional momentum . in the presence of an external radiation intersubband excitation probabilities are equal for states with opposite momentum .",
    "therefore , there is no change in current associated with external radiation .    during the last 15 years",
    "there has been a great interest in theoretical and experimental investigations of photovoltaic effects and photoconductance in quantum wires ( see refs . - and references therein ) .",
    "mechanisms for pure spin current generation in 2d and 1d systems with spin - orbit interaction have also been discussed  @xcite .",
    "it is known that a photovoltaic effect is possible in quantum wires without inversion symmetry .",
    "for example , a photovoltaic effect in quantum wires with spatially dependent lateral confinement was predicted in ref .  .",
    "in the present paper we consider a different _ spin_-based mechanism for photovoltaic effect , which is very interesting in the context of the fast growing field of spintronics .",
    "@xcite the most important component of our scheme is the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "however , the spin - orbit interaction alone is not sufficient to generate a charge photocurrent if the quantum wire is spatially homogeneous .",
    "therefore , we consider a wire in an in - plane magnetic field which breaks the inversion symmetry",
    ".    we can identify the following groups of inter - subband transitions that lead to a photovoltaic effect in quantum wires :    1 .",
    "transitions between spin - splitted subbands with the same confinement quantum numbers . 2 .",
    "transitions between subbands with different confinement quantum numbers .",
    "the main difference between these two groups is that the first is generated by the magnetic field component of electromagnetic radiation , while transitions from the second group are due to the electric field component . in a recent paper  @xcite a spin - photovoltaic effect in quantum wires due to transitions of the first type was considered .",
    "it was found that a special role in the photovoltaic effect is played by transitions in which the direction of electron velocity changes .",
    "the importance of this velocity inversion was outlined earlier , see e.g. ref .",
    ", in studies of photoconductance .",
    "here we consider intersubband transitions of the second type .",
    "an important feature in semiconductor - based quantum wires is that the spin - orbit interaction constants are different for subbands with different confinement quantum numbers .",
    "this peculiarity is essential in our scheme for the generation of photocurrent .",
    "the goal of this paper is to calculate the current in a quantum wire at zero bias voltage due to external radiation .",
    "the current as a function of radiation frequency is found numerically from coupled equations involving wigner functions .",
    "the wigner function formalism has many advantages for investigating transport problems  @xcite . among them",
    "we mention the phase - space nature of wigner functions which are similar to the classical boltzmann distribution functions .",
    "this feature makes possible to separate the incoming and outgoing components of the electron distribution at the boundaries which , in turn , facilitates the modeling of an ideal contact .",
    "the commonly used assumptions are : the distribution of electrons emitted in the quantum wire can be described by the equilibrium distribution function of the leads reservoirs , and all electron are collected by the leads reservoirs without reflection . in this work",
    "we extend the description of the transport dynamics to include inter - subband transitions due to electro - magnetic wave excitation .",
    "we show that the current is sensitive to many control parameters like , e.g. , the spin - orbit coupling and external magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the current can be used to determine materials parameters .",
    "the calculated current strength for a realistic set of parameters is of the order of @xmath0 na and consequently can be measured using standard experimental techniques .",

    "however , we found that radiation - induced changes in spin current are much less than the equilibrium spin current in the wire . from an experimental point of view , the spin currents are not so easy detectable .",
    "therefore , the observation of this photovoltaic effect through spin current seems unpractical .",
    "in summary , in this paper we have investigated the photovoltaic effect in quantum wires with spin - orbit interaction and in - plane magnetic field .",
    "we have found that the peculiarities of the energy spectrum lead to a photocurrent generation .",
    "the dependence of the photoinduced current on the excitation frequency was calculated numerically using the wigner functions formalism .",
    "a system of coupled equations for the wigner functions was derived and solved numerically for `` ideal '' contact boundary conditions .",
    "we used the first order upwind differencing for the propagation in the spatial domain and the second order two - step lax - wendroff differencing for time - dependent inter - subband transitions due to electro - magnetic wave excitation .",
    "stable numerical solutions were found under appropriate choices of the time - step @xmath137 .",
    "the calculations can be extended to introduce the effects of an external bias and self - consistent potentials due to charge density redistributions which can be a topic for a future investigation .",
    "the frequency dependence of the photoinduced current consists of a set of peaks related to transitions between different points of the spectrum .",
    "therefore , the energy spectrum can be reconstructed from photocurrent measurements .",
    "material parameters , such as spin - orbit coupling constants , can be obtained from the analysis of the photocurrent .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge useful discussions with m. cheng and l. fedichkin . this research was supported by the national science foundation , grants dmr-0121146 and dmr-0312491 ."
