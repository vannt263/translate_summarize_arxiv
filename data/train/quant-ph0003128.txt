    "the most compelling theoretical question , @xmath1localization , \" is yielding an answer which points the way to a solution of quantum computing s ( qc ) most daunting engineering problem : reaching the accuracy threshold for fault tolerant computation .",
    "after shor s discovery [ s1 ] of a polynomial time factoring algorithm in the quantum model qc , skeptics properly questioned whether a unitary evolution could ever be induced to process information fault tolerantly .",
    "the most obvious tricks , such as making a backup copy , useful in a dissipative system ( e.g. pencil and paper ) are unavailable in quantum mechanics . to overcome these difficulties , a remarkable theoretical framework based on @xmath1stabilizer codes , `` @xmath1transversal gates , '' @xmath1cat - state - ancilli , \" and nested concatenations of these",
    "was erected [ s2 ] , [ s3 ] , [ a , b - o ] , [ k1 ] , and [ klz ] .",
    "while the result is a consistent recipe for fault - tolerant quantum computation , the accuracy threshold which would allow this combinatorial behemoth to overcome its own overhead has been estimated as about @xmath2 , one i.i.d .",
    "error per one million physical gate operations and requiring gates accurate also to one part in a million .",
    "this places a formidable task before the engineer and physicist .",
    "but within the year the beginnings of a new idea on fault tolerance had been generated by kitaev [ k2 ] .    while the term is not yet present in that paper the idea is to construct ( first mathematically ) a @xmath1quantum medium `` and to store quantum states as topological structures within the medium and ( eventually ) manipulate these states , that is , apply gates to them , by topological transformations of the medium . for our purposes , we define a quantum medium as a collection of many finite level systems coupled together by a hamiltonian @xmath3 obeying a strong locality condition : the individual systems are located in a @xmath4dimensional lattice or a more irregular cellulation of a surface @xmath5 .",

    "kitaev s @xmath1toric code '' [ k2 ] in which quantum states are stored as first homology of a torus , can be counted as having @xmath18 ; they require @xmath19ary interactions .",
    "we study here a partial generalization of the toric code which also stores quantum information in a degenerate ground state @xmath20 of a quantum medium .",

    "also explores the realization of elements of computation by braiding anyonic @xmath1quasi - particles `` or @xmath1defects '' of a quantum medium .",
    "the vision is that stability of computation , at least sufficient to reach the @xmath2 threshold for @xmath1software `` error correction , is to be realized by the discreteness of algebraic topology : two @xmath22homology cycles are never @xmath1close , '' two words in the braid group are equal or distinct .",
    "more exactly , it is geometry not topology which will confer stability . working in a lattice model one",
    "may calculate [ k2 ] that the perturbation hamiltonian @xmath23 must be raised to the length scale @xmath24 before nonzero terms , @xmath25 ground state @xmath26 , are encountered and so the splitting of the ground state is estimated to be proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "the length scale in the previous two examples are : @xmath28 ( length of shortest essential cycle ) ; and in the anyonic context , the closest that two defects are allowed to come to each other during braiding . the @xmath1engineering goal `` is to construct a quantum medium on a material disk whose ground state admits many localized excitations ( @xmath1anyons '' ) whose braidings effect computationally universal unitary transformations of the ground state .",
    "it is further hoped that actual @xmath1errors , `` the result of unwanted noisy excitations , are to be removed automatically by some relaxation process in which the system is coupled to a cold bath by another much weaker hamiltonian @xmath29 .",
    "the mathematicians first cut at the engineering goal is to produce a quantum medium with these properties and this is accomplished by the theorem below .",

    "cs5 is a universal model for quantum computation and for the physicist / engineer to implement it , a local hamiltonian @xmath3 must be described . for the pure mathematician to be satisfied with his understanding of cs5",
    "it must be localized to points .",
    "the two objectives are certainly similar in spirit and possibly identical .",
    "to clarify the connection , we introduce an intermediate concept , undoubtedly plebeian , but dear to a topologist .",
    "we would like when possible to describe a vector in a modular functor as a linear combinations of @xmath1admissible `` up to @xmath1equivalence . ''",
    "this , after all , is exactly how we understand homology : @xmath85 is an equivalence class of admissible pictures . to be admissible",
    "the picture must be a closed @xmath82manifold , the equivalence relation is bordism . both @xmath86manifold - ness `` and @xmath1bordism '' can be defined by local conditions which are the combinatorial analogs of @xmath1closed `` and @xmath1co - closed '' familiar from de rham s theory of differential forms . in kitaev",
    "s toric code these condition are imposed by vertex and face operators @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "there is a subtle shift here from the usual way of thinking of homology as equivalence classes of cycles to the @xmath1harmonic \" representative which is merely the equally weighted average of all cycles in the homology class . in this way",
    "quotients and equivalence classes are never encountered and homology is located within cycles , within chains , just as a c.s.s .",

    "but in the present case no such embellishments are required .",
    "what is important that if we move the surface by a diffeomorphism , the picture should also move and move canonically .",
    "thus if @xmath5 is a torus it would not suite our purposes to draw the picture of @xmath92 in a solid torus @xmath93 , @xmath94 : a meridial dehn twist on @xmath5 extends over @xmath93 , twisting the picture , but a longitudinal dehn twist does not have any obvious way to act on a picture drawn in @xmath93 .",

    "resorting to the @xmath95matrix does not solve our problem since its input and output pictures are on a scale of the injectivity radius of the surfaces and hence nonlocal . )",
    "we demand that @xmath1admissibility `` and @xmath1equivalence '' of pictures be locally determined , i.e. decided on the basis of restriction to small patches on @xmath5 . to make the connection with lattice models , we consider @xmath5 discretized as a cell complex ; the conditions must span only clumps of cells of constant combinatorial diameter .",
    "as in the example of harmonic @xmath82cycles , @xmath1equivalence \" is a slight misnomer : what we impose instead are invariance condition on the ( linear combinations of ) admissible pictures representing any fixed @xmath96 which ensure that the stabilized vectors are in fact equally weighted superpositions of all admissible pictures representing @xmath97 .",
    "now consider the question , perhaps the first question a geometric topologist should ask about a modular functor @xmath98 ; can you draw a ( local ) picture of it on @xmath5 so that the mapping class group of @xmath5 acts on @xmath20 by the obvious induced action on pictures ?",
    "we should not expect it to be easy to discover the local rules for the pictures associated to a given modular functor @xmath56 and in fact they may not exist in much generality . recall that a three manifold @xmath74 bounding @xmath5 , @xmath99 determines a vector @xmath100 so we might think of our proposed picture @xmath101 drawn on @xmath5 as some ghostly recollection of @xmath74 . the present understanding of modular functors is closely related to surgery formulas on links , but to think in this way we must choose a @xmath1base point \" @xmath66manifold @xmath102 with @xmath103 to hold the links .",
    "this choice seems to create an asymmetry which should not be present in @xmath104 .",
    "thus for a pictorial representation of @xmath56 which is derived from surgery , we expect only part of the mapping group @xmath105 that part extending over @xmath106 will act locally . to localize v , this problem must be overcome .",
    "let us propose a meta theorem or @xmath1principle `` that solving the @xmath1picture problem , '' which we call @xmath1combinatorial localization , `` should imply both the freed - walker program , which we call @xmath1algebraic localization '' and the design problem for the hamiltonian @xmath3 which we call @xmath1physical localization . \"",

    "we show how to represent cs5 ( and by extension all csr ) on a disk with marked points by local pictures .",
    "since the representation of quantum computing within cs5 [ flw ] only used the braid group acting on a disk with marked points , this partial solution to the combinatorial localization problem will suffice to prove the theorem ( once we have explained the solid arrow in figure 1 ) .    for any @xmath108",

    "nearby error pairs may be more serious in cs5 than in the toric codes since isotopy class not just homology needs to be preserved ; the wrong reconnection pairing would result in an unrecoverable error . to make this unlikely , should additional terms be included into our hamiltonian @xmath3 which could force distinct strands to be widely separated ?",
    "this would put more weight on the simpler pictures , which are the ones that the quantum medium can most easily correct if damaged .",
