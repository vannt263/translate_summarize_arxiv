    "stars in nature are usually rotating and subject to nonaxisymmetric rotational instabilities ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "an exact treatment of these instabilities exists only for incompressible equilibrium fluids in newtonian gravity , ( e.g. @xcite ) . for these configurations ,",
    "global rotational instabilities arise from non - radial toroidal modes @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) when @xmath9 exceeds a certain critical value . here",
    "@xmath10 is the azimuthal coordinate and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the rotational kinetic and gravitational binding energies . in the following",
    "we will focus on the @xmath11 bar - mode , since it is the fastest growing mode when the rotation is sufficiently rapid .",
    "there exist two different mechanisms and corresponding timescales for bar - mode instabilities . uniformly rotating",
    ", incompressible stars in newtonian theory are _ secularly _ unstable to bar - mode formation when @xmath12 .",
    "this instability can grow in the presence of some dissipative mechanism , like viscosity or gravitational radiation , and the growth time is determined by the dissipative timescale , which is usually much longer than the dynamical timescale of the system . by contrast , a _",
    "dynamical _ instability to bar - mode formation sets in when @xmath13 .",
    "this instability is independent of any dissipative mechanism , and the growth time is the hydrodynamic timescale of the system .",
    "there are two representative dissipative mechanisms that drive the secular bar mode instability , viscosity and the gravitational radiation , in the absence of thermal dissipation .",
    "the viscosity driven instability sets in when a mode has a zero - frequency in the frame rotating with the star @xcite , and the first unstable mode in terms of @xmath14 is the @xmath0 bar mode . the quasi - static evolution of the star due to viscosity driven instability , which varies the circulation of the star , deforms the maclaurin spheroid to the jacobi ellipsoid in newtonian incompressible stars . on the other hand , the gravitational radiation induced instability @xcite sets in when the backward going mode is dragged forward in the inertial frame ( see @xcite for reviews ) , and the mode in terms of @xmath14 are all unstable when it exceeds a certain @xmath14 .",
    "the quasi - static evolution of the star due to gravitational radiation induced instability , which varies the angular momentum of the star , deforms the maclaurin spheroid to the dedekind ellipsoid in newtonian incompressible stars .    the viscosity driven instability , especially to determine the critical value either in an incompressible star or in an ellipsoidal equilibrium , has been studied in newtonian gravity @xcite , in post newtonian gravity @xcite , and in full general relativity @xcite by an ellipsoidal approximation ( e.g. @xcite ) or by an iterative evolution approximation ( e.g. @xcite ) , and shows that the viscosity drives the instability to higher rotation rates @xmath15 as the configurations become more compact .",
    "there is also a study of newtonian compressible stars to determine the critical value of viscosity driven instability @xcite : it is found that the star becomes secularly unstable at @xmath16 , depending on the stiffness of the polytropic equation of state .",
    "the aim of the paper is twofold .",
    "one is to investigate the critical value of viscosity driven instability in the compressible stars rotating uniformly .",
    "the argument that the viscosity driven instability plays a role to deform a star from a maclaurin spheroid to a jacobi ellipsoid is only true in the absence of internal energy , since the total energy has a chance to transfer it to the internal energy without emission from the star ( e.g. @xcite ) . here",
    "we assume that the cooling timescale of the star is shorter than the thermal heating timescale so that the thermal energy generated by viscosity is immediately radiated away .",
    "therefore the picture of the deformation process due to viscosity is quite similar to the case of incompressible stars .",
    "the stars are usually considered as compressible bodies , and therefore it is worth to take such effect into account whether there is a significant change on the threshold . in this respect",
    "the present work extends that of ref .",
    "@xcite to the compressible case .",
    "the other aim of the present work is to investigate the effect of differential rotation on the viscosity driven secular bar mode instabilities . for a strong viscosity or strong magnetic field circumstances ,",
    "the star maintains uniform rotation .",
    "however , in nature the star may rotate differentially as the sun . stellar collapses and mergers may also lead to differentially rotating stars ( e.g. @xcite ) . for the coalescence of binary irrotational neutron stars @xcite , the presence of differential rotation may temporarily stabilize the `` hypermassive '' remnant , which constructs a differential rotation .",
    "therefore it is also worth to take differential rotation into account to study viscosity driven instabilities in rotating relativistic stars .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "note that latin index takes @xmath18 .",
    "we briefly introduce our basic approach to construct rotating relativistic stars and allow nonaxisymmetric deformation induced by `` viscosity '' .",
    "we introduce a nonaxisymmetric line element , when the azimuthal component @xmath10 is separable in the metric @xcite , in spherical coordinates @xmath20 with a quasi - isotropic gauge ( e.g. @xcite ) as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the lapse , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 correspond to the shift , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the spatial metric functions . in the equilibrium state , we only take the azimuthal component of the shift @xmath25 , the lapse , and two spatial metric functions into account of the metric components .",
    "note that all of them are functions of @xmath28 and @xmath29 only .",
    "once we impose the nonaxisymmetric perturbation in the lapse , we take all the components of shift into account , and relax the dependence of the functions of ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) to ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath10 ) for lapse and shift @xcite . in our present approach",
    "the nonaxisymmetric terms have been taken into account at least to the @xmath30 post - newtonian order .",
    "note that the spatial metric functions keep the functional dependence of ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) as those terms are considered as a higher post - newtonian order which only enters in the order of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the amplitude of the perturbation we imposed in the lapse , @xmath33 the gravitational mass , @xmath34 the circumferential radius .",
    "it is therefore a good approximation to drop the nonaxisymmetric contribution from the spatial part of the metric . to summarize we compute the exact relativistic rotating equilibrium star and perturb the geometrical quantities in lapse and in shift , neglecting the azimuthal perturbation in the spatial metric .",

    "our computations have been made via a multi - domain spectral method @xcite .",
    "we have developed a code to implement this method by using the c++ library lorene @xcite .",
    "the key advantage of the spectral method is that the required number of grid points to obtain a sufficiently high accuracy is quite small compared to the grid points in finite differencing , and the accuracy is guaranteed up to the round - off error in principle . since this method is only applicable to smooth functions , we treat the discontinuity at the surface of the star by splitting the computational domain .",
    "note that we introduce three computational domains to cover the space .",
    "the innermost domain covers the whole star , while the outermost one is compactified which allows to cover the space up to spatial infinity .",
    "we also use surface fitting method to split the domain at the surface of the star @xcite .",
    "this method works perfect until the equatorial surface of the star has a cusp , which happens when the uniformly rotating star approaches to the mass shedding limit , or the star is highly deformed from the sphere due to differential rotation .",

    "we particularly focus on the effect of relativistic gravitation for compressible fluids . the physical viewpoint of this approach is only shown in newtonian incompressible star that to study the transition from a uniformly rotating axisymmetric body ( maclaurin spheroid ) to a nonaxisymmetric body ( jacobi ellipsoid ) .",
    "according to @xcite , the above deformation process is driven by viscosity , since it only varies the circulation but keeps the other two conserved quantities , total energy and angular momentum , in the newtonian incompressible star .",
    "the computational viewpoint of this approach is that instead of performing the time evolution of the star to investigate the stability of the star , we treat the iterative number as evolutional time and determine the stability of the star .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that there is no restriction to the evolutional timestep even in a high compactness star .",
    "note that it is entirely difficult to study the secular instability in the explicit evolution scheme in full general relativistic hydrodynamics , since the restriction from the courant timestep scales as @xmath104 .",
    "the uncertain issue in this approach is that whether one can treat iterative number as evolutional time , and there is no relationship between each other in a mathematical sense .",
    "however there is a correspondence : in the newtonian incompressible star , @xcite investigate the difference between the exact critical value on the bifurcation point ( e.g. @xcite ) and find that it is within the round - off error .",
    "our computational study of the iterative evolution approach is divided into two stages ; construction of a rotating equilibrium star and the determination of the viscosity driven bar mode stability of a rotating equilibrium star . to construct a rotating equilibrium star ,",
    "we first construct a spherical star with given parameters of @xmath59 and @xmath105 , as an initial guess of the metric components and the matter profile .",
    "next we solve gravitational field equations and determine the new matter profile for the next iteration step . during the iteration we impose rotation at the given iteration step ,",
    "start varying the angular velocity to the given required value at the given iteration step , stop varying the angular velocity at the given required value at the given iteration step .",
    "we stop our iteration cycle when the relative error of the enthalpy norm between the previous step and the current step is within @xmath106 .",
    "we check the relativistic virial identity and the identity for all the equilibrium configuration and find that the relative errors of grv2 and grv3 are @xmath107 several @xmath108 .",
    "to determine the stability of rotating relativistic star driven by viscosity , we follow all the computational procedure to construct a rotating equilibrium star until we reach the relative error of the enthalpy norm at @xmath109 . at this iteration step , we put the following @xmath0 perturbation in the logarithmic lapse to enhance the growth of the bar mode instability as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the logarithmic lapse in the equilibrium , @xmath32 is the amplitude of the perturbation . we diagnose the maximum logarithmic lapse of the @xmath0 coefficients in terms of mode decomposition as @xmath112 where @xmath113 we also define the logarithmic derivative of @xmath114 in the iteration step @xmath115 as @xmath116 where @xmath117 denotes @xmath114 at the iteration step @xmath115 .",
    "we determine the stability of the star in terms of viscosity driven instability as follows .",
    "when the diagnostic @xmath114 grows exponentially after we impose a bar mode perturbation in the logarithmic lapse , we conclude that the star is unstable . on the other hand",
    "when the diagnostic decays after we put a perturbation , the star is stable .",

    "we conclude that the equilibrium star is unstable when the @xmath118 settles down to a positive constant value , while stable to a negative constant value .",
    "note that the existence of the plateau in @xmath118 after the several iteration steps once we put a perturbation confirms us that we are in the linear perturbation regime , and therefore guarantees our choice of the perturbation amplitude we imposed ( @xmath32 ) .",
