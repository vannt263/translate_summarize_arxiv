    "lead - halide perovskites , with the general chemical structure _ abx_@xmath0 , have recently reemerged as promising materials for opto - electronic applications.@xcite the most prominent candidates to date for perovskite - based solar cells are the hybrid organic - inorganic perovskites@xcite , where _ a _ is the organic cation , @xmath2 , and _ x _ is the halide .",
    "the most widely studied examples in this material class are the methylammonium ( ma ) lead halides@xcite ( ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pb(i",
    "/ br / cl)@xmath0 , mapb(i / cl / br)@xmath0 ) .",
    "their bandgaps range from approximately @xmath3{ev}$ ] ( mapbi@xmath0 ) to @xmath4{ev}$ ] ( mapbcl@xmath0).@xcite they exhibit structural phase transitions in an orthorhombic - tetragonal - cubic sequence , with mapbi@xmath0 being tetragonal at room temperature , and mapbbr@xmath0 and mapbcl@xmath0 both cubic.@xcite as the phase transitions occur close to room temperature , structural fluctuations of the lead - halide cage have potentially strong impact on the opto - electronic properties.@xcite    long charge carrier diffusion lengths exceeding @xmath5{\\upmu m}$ ] have been reported for mapbi@xmath0 and mapbbr@xmath0 single crystals and thin films.@xcite the urbach energies in these materials are @xmath6{mev}$ ] , comparable to the values for typical inorganic crystalline semiconductor materials like gaas,@xcite suggesting a low prevalence of bandgap states , which often lower the carrier mobilities in semiconductors . despite the low number of band gap states and 3d arrangement of the cornor sharing lead halide octahedras , the charge carrier mobilities are modest , especially in view of the low effective masses.@xcite moreover , the thermal conductivity of mapbi@xmath0 has recently been calculated to be ultralow.@xcite all of these properties are intimately connected to the nature of the lattice vibrations in these materials . in particular , the modest charge carrier mobilities have been explained by either predominant electron scattering from acoustic@xcite or optical phonons@xcite or the formation of polarons@xcite . to better understand such fundamental material properties , detailed knowledge of the phonon spectra is mandatory .",
    "such can in principle be obtained from raman measurements , which for mapbx@xmath0 are , however , experimentally challenging due to the ease of beam damage under laser irradiation .",
    "far infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy circumvents the beam damage problem and reveals information complementary to raman spectroscopy .",
    "several far - ir studies of mapbx@xmath0 have appeared over the last two years.@xcite prez - osorio et al . measured the frequency of the transversal optical ( to ) phonons and theoretically predicted a strong lo - to splitting for the strongest vibration.@xcite wright et al . estimated the longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonon frequencies indirectly via temperature dependent photoluminescence measurements ( @xmath7=11.5 and 15.3mev , 92 and 122@xmath8).@xcite however , a direct experimental determination of the lo phonon frequency is currently missing . in view of the fact that lo phonons can interact with charge carriers ,",
    "this is important to understand charge transport close to room temperature .",
    "herein we report far - ir spectra of the three methylammonium lead halide ( mapb(i / br / cl)@xmath0 ) thin films and provide a detailed quantitative analysis of the lattice vibrations corroborated by reflectance measurements on single crystals . from these data ,",
    "we determine the frequencies and damping coefficients of both lo and to phonons and find strong broadening and anharmonicity of the lattice vibrations for all three halide perovskites .",
    "this indicates dynamic disorder of the lead - halide cage at room temperature , in agreement with recent low frequency , off - resonance raman measurements of mapbbr@xmath0.@xcite from our data we calculate the static dielectric constants of all three halide perovskites via the cochran - cowley relation.@xcite we use the derived dielectric constants and phonon frequencies to estimate electron - phonon coupling constants and polaron masses . to reveal the importance of optical vibrations for charge transport",
    ", we employ the feynman polaron model at elevated temperatures in conjunction with exciton effective masses , which provides upper limits for the optical phonon - scattering limited charge carrier mobilities in methylammonium lead halide perovskites .",
    "relative transmittance of a 266 nm thick mapbi@xmath9 ( black ) and a 130 nm thick pbi@xmath10 ( red ) thin film on a silicon substrate under normal incidence ( solid ) , and under @xmath11 angle of incidence ( dashed ) with unpolarized light .",
    "the positions of the strongest respective to and lo modes are marked with dashed vertical lines . ]",
    "we measured far ir spectra in the range of @xmath12{cm^{-1}}$ ] , which contain information on the pb - x lattice vibrations , in contrast to the mid ir range that is dominated by molecular vibrations of the ma cation@xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] compares measurements of a mapbi@xmath0 thin film under two angles of incidence with the measurement of the corresponding lead halide , pbi@xmath13 .",
    "whereas at normal incidence one can only determine the resonance frequency of the to mode ( @xmath14 ) , it is possible to additionally determine the position of the longitudinal optical vibration ( @xmath7 ) at non - normal incidence via the berreman mode.@xcite for polar materials such as mapbi@xmath0 the lo frequency is higher than the to frequency , hence a clear lo - to splitting occurs . the peak positions for mapbi@xmath0 and pbi@xmath13 , determined through detailed analysis of the data as discussed below , are indicated in figure [ fig:1 ] and differ by only @xmath15{cm^{-1}}$ ] .",
    "this is reasonable given the similar bulk moduli @xmath16 for the two materials,@xcite which are directly related to the lo frequency of the crystals ( @xmath17).@xcite the strong broadening and asymmetry of the main to mode of mapbi@xmath0 at 63@xmath8 ( 8 mev ) is apparent when compared to the sharp and symmetric to mode of pbi@xmath13 . since mapbi@xmath0 is highly crystalline , as evidenced by typically very sharp xrd peaks at room temperature , the phonon broadening is unlikely to be explained by static disorder caused by the micro strain present in polycrystalline thin films since the broadening is also present in single crystals as we show below .",
    "we rather attribute it to dynamic disorder of the perovskite structure,@xcite similar to certain oxide perovskites.@xcite given the frequency range of our measurements and the similar peak positions of mapbi@xmath0 and pbi@xmath13 , this likely originates from disorder of the lead - halide framework that is coupled to fast reorientations of the methylammonium cation@xcite , and possibly accompanied by strongly anharmonic hopping of pb and/or i.@xcite     relative transmittance of 266 nm thick mapbi@xmath0 ( black ) , 287 nm thick mapbbr@xmath0 ( blue ) and 226 nm thick mapbcl@xmath0 ( green ) thin films on silicon substrates at normal incidence ( solid ) and at @xmath18 angle of incidence ( dashed ) with unpolarized light .",
    "model fits for both angles of incidence for every mapbx@xmath19 , are shown in red dashed lines . ]",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the measured far ir spectra of all three methylammonium lead halides at two angles of incidence together with optically modeled spectra .",
    "given the strong lo - to splitting and anharmonic phonon coupling apparent in our data , a harmonic potential of the vibrations can not be assumed anymore .",
    "therefore , we use the gervais model@xcite to fit the spectra for the dielectric function , which extends the harmonic oscillator model to the case of strong oscillations and , in contrast to a lorentz oscillator , allows for different damping coefficients for lo and to phonons ( @xmath20):@xcite    @xmath21    the model takes into account that to modes appear as the poles of @xmath22 , and lo modes are the zeros of @xmath22.@xcite the high frequency dielectric background @xmath23 is taken from mid - infrared spectral modeling.@xcite two oscillators were used in equation [ eq:1 ] to model the spectra for each thin film , simultaneously for the two angles of incidence - one rather strong oscillator and a second weaker one on the low energy side of the spectrum . although the fits show minor deviations from the measured data , the agreement is very good overall .",
    "following previously published theoretical calculations,@xcite we assign the mode at 32@xmath8 in mapbi@xmath0 mostly to a pb - i - pb rocking vibration , and the stronger mode at @xmath24{cm^{-1}}$ ] mostly to a pb - i stretching vibration .",
    "a similar assignment of modes can be assumed for mapbbr@xmath0 and mapbcl@xmath0 , given their chemical similarity to mapbi@xmath0 .",
    "relative reflectance spectra of mapbi@xmath0 ( black ) , mapbbr@xmath0 ( red ) , and mapbcl@xmath0 ( green ) single crystals at room temperature with unpolarized light under an @xmath25 angle of incidence ( gold mirror as reference ) .",
    "the corresponding solid lines show calculated reflectance spectra using the dielectric function , derived for the thin films shown in figure [ fig:4 ] .",
    "( spectra with star were scaled in intensity ) .",
    "]    we performed additional far ir measurements on single crystals to corroborate the thin film results and exclude possible influence of grain boundaries .",
    "we note that due to their thickness and extinction coefficients these have to be measured in reflection geometry and that the spectra of the i and br single crystals were scaled in intensity because the crystal facets were smaller than the ir beam diameter .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the measured reflection spectra of the single crystals together with simulated spectra that were calculated using the corresponding dielectric functions obtained from the thin film transmission measurements .",
    "all three halide perovskites display an increased reflectivity in the spectral range between the to and lo modes .",
    "this so called reststrahlen band is typical for polar materials with strong lo - to splitting.@xcite due to the increasing @xmath14 and @xmath7 values from i to cl , also the reststrahlen band is blueshifted , as can be seen in the single crystal measurements .",
    "importantly , we observe very good agreement between the measurements and calculations for all three spectra , which underlines that the dielectric functions obtained from the thin film measurements are meaningful .",
    "the derived dielectric functions are shown in figure [ fig:4 ] .",
    "the increase of the phonon frequencies in the i - br - cl series can be well described by the decrease of the effective ionic masses , @xmath26 , of halides x involved in pb - x oscillations @xmath27 , which strongly corroborates our assignment of these modes to lead - halide stretch vibrations .",
    "figure 4 also shows the loss function , @xmath28 , the peaks of which mark the positions of frequencies corresponding to lo phonons.@xcite    .[tab:1]summary of the obtained to and lo phonon frequencies and dampings , as well as the high and low frequency dielectric constants . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     importantly , these parameters can be used to estimate an upper limit for charge carrier mobilities @xmath29 in hybrid perovskites under the assumption that carriers are interacting only with optical phonons .",
    "previously , kadanoff s equation@xcite for weakly coupled polarons in the low temperature regime was used to estimate the charge carrier mobility _ _ in mapbi@xmath0.@xcite in view of the rather low debye temperatures of mapbx@xmath0@xcite and that for solar cell devices we are especially interested in @xmath29 at room temperature , we have to use the general result of feynman et al.,@xcite obtained in the absence of the low temperature approximation:@xcite    @xmath30    here , @xmath31 , _ v _ , and _ w _ are temperature - dependent variational parameters , and @xmath32 is a function of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35.@xcite we calculated _ v _ and _ w _ by minimizing the free polaron energy ( see si for details).@xcite the obtained upper limits for the charge carrier mobilties at room temperature are listed in table [ tab:2 ] .",
    "we find values around 200 , 150 , and 50@xmath36 for mapbi@xmath0 , mapbbr@xmath0 , and mapbcl@xmath0 , respectivly .",
    "we estimate the error bar due to experimental uncertainties in the determination of the phonon frequencies as @xmath37 .",
    "the lower value for mapbcl@xmath0 is mainly a result of the higher @xmath38 , which is related to the higher ionicity of the pb - cl bonds indicated by the higher lo - to splitting .",
    "the observed strong broadening and anharmonicity of the lattice vibrations imply a large dynamic disorder in methylammonium lead halides at room temperature .",
    "the fast reorientation of the methylammonium cation in the pbi@xmath0 host framework certainly contributes to this dynamic disorder.@xcite moreover , it was recently reported that dynamic disorder is intrinsic to the general lead - halide perovskite structure even in the absence of organic cations.@xcite this effect may well contribute to the broadening of the vibrations observed here .",
    "we note that the addition of a central peak to the dielectric function that would indicate strongly anharmonic hopping@xcite of pb or i , while consistent with our data , improves the quality of our fits only to a limited extent ( see si ) .",
    "our obtained to positions for mapbi@xmath0 are very similar to those previously published by la - o - vorakiat et al.@xcite however , our oscillator strengths are roughly twice as large , possibly due to only partial surface coverage of the films used by la - o - vorakiat et al .",
    "( see si for detailed comparison ) .",
    "we also find good qualitative agreement with a recently published dielectric function of mapbi@xmath19 obtained from dft and md calculations.@xcite our lo frequencies for mapbi@xmath0 and mapbbr@xmath0 are somewhat higher but still close to those indirectly estimated from temperature dependent photoluminescence measurements by wright et al .  @xcite confirming their analysis .",
    "the determined polaron coupling constants for mapbx@xmath0 of @xmath39 are at the higher end of the range typical for weak coupling ( large polarons ) .",
    "nevertheless , the polaron radii are consistent with large polarons , as they are far above the lattice constants of the materials and , in fact , show that polarons are spread over several unit cells .",
    "consequently , the polaron masses are less than 50% higher than the reduced excitonic mass determined from magneto optical studies.@xcite    a comparison of our mobility estimations to literature reports is complicated by the wide spread of published values .",
    "for example , for mapbi@xmath0 measured mobilities around 50@xmath40v@xmath41s@xmath41 for thin films@xcite and 2.5 or 165@xmath40v@xmath41s@xmath41 for single crystals@xcite have been reported .",
    "overall , our estimates are at the higher end of reported values , which is what one would expect as our numbers are upper limits in the complete absence of defect scattering , acoustic phonon scattering , and the possible impact of local polaronic distortions.@xcite our findings nevertheless imply that room temperature mobilities well below 100@xmath40v@xmath41s@xmath41 obtained from mapbi@xmath0 single crystal measurements may be strongly influenced by surface or interface effects",
    ". however , room temperature mobility values which are estimated to be significantly above @xmath1{cm^{2}v^{-1}s^{-1}}$ ] require careful scrutiny.@xcite    we included the polaron parameters of gaas@xcite in table [ tab:2 ] for comparison .",
    "we can attribute the large difference in mobility between gaas and the perovskites to two material properties : ( _ i _ ) the stronger ionic screening ( indicative of a higher ionicity ) , and ( _ ii _ ) the lower lo phonon energy in the perovskites .",
    "the lead halide perovskites are a rare example for semiconductors with a debye temperature of the lo phonon frequency , @xmath42 , below room temperature , leading to a strong occupation of phonon states at 300k which limits the mobility .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the temperature dependence of the carrier mobility . for mapbi@xmath0 , a comparison is complicated because the cubic - to - tetragonal phase transition temperature is close to room temperature . for mapbbr@xmath0",
    ", the transition occurs around 240k and so it is generally an easier task . in the si",
    "we demonstrate numerically that between 350k to 250k the mobility of mapbbr@xmath0 , including only the scattering due to optical phonons , changes as @xmath43 .",
    "indeed , it has been discussed that in the cubic phase , the overall temperature dependence of the measured hall mobility is best described as @xmath44 , typical for scattering due to acoustic phonons only.@xcite however , from the same data , one may conclude that closer to room temperature , a shallower temperature dependence may also be appropriate . at the same time",
    ", it is unlikely that for lead - halide perovskites just a single scattering mechanism will be active , given the typically rather broad range of interaction phenomena relevant for semiconductors around room temperature .",
    "this clearly highlights the need for more experimental data accompanied by theoretical calculations to better understand the transport of carriers in lead - halide perovskites .",
    "in summary , we measured and analyzed quantitatively the lattice vibrations of the three methylammonium lead halide perovskites at room temperature . the spectra point to strong anharmonicity and dynamic disorder in these materials at room temperature ,",
    "similar to certain oxide perovskites.@xcite our detailed analysis of the obtained far ir spectra allows us to directly determine the lo - to splitting , and deduce the strength of electron - phonon coupling in mapbx@xmath0 .",
    "our estimated upper limit for the room temperature mobility in mapbi@xmath0 of @xmath45{cm^{2}v^{-1}s^{-1}}$ ] indicates that there is still considerable room for further improvement of thin film quality , where mobilities of up to 50@xmath40v@xmath41s@xmath41 have been achieved.@xcite however , we also show that despite only moderate polaron masses , the low lo phonon frequency and high ionicity of the lead halide perovskites fundamentally limit the charge carrier mobilities in these materials .",

    "afterwards they were dried in a n@xmath13 stream . for perovskite film preparation",

    "<S> herein we report far - infrared spectroscopy measurements of ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pb(i / br / cl)@xmath0 thin films and single crystals at room temperature and a detailed quantitative analysis of the spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we find strong broadening and anharmonicity of the lattice vibrations for all three halide perovskites , which indicates dynamic disorder of the lead - halide cage at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the frequencies of the transversal and longitudinal optical phonons , and use them to calculate , via appropriate models , the static dielectric constants , polaron masses , electron - phonon coupling constants , and upper limits for the phonon - scattering limited charge carrier mobilities . within the limitations of the model used , </S>",
    "<S> we can place an upper limit of @xmath1{cm^{2}v^{-1}s^{-1}}$ ] for the room temperature charge carrier mobility in mapbi@xmath0 single crystals . </S>",
    "<S> our findings are important for the basic understanding of charge transport processes and mechanical properties in metal halide perovskites . </S>"
