    "<S> we compute the energy levels of a 2d hydrogen atom when a constant magnetic field is applied . with the help of a mixed - basis variational method and a generalization of virial theorem , which consists in scaling the wave function , </S>",

    "<S> we compare the computed energy spectra with those obtained via a generalization of the mesh point technique as well as the shifted @xmath2 method . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the variational solutions present a very good behavior in the weak and strong magnetic field regimes .    in the past few years </S>",
    "<S> a great effort has been devoted to the study of two - dimensional atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the technological advances in semiconductor processing has enabled to manufacture nanostructures where the electrons are confined to two dimensional ( quantum wells ) , one dimensional ( quantum wires ) and zero dimensional ( quantum dots ) motions ( @xcite and references therein ) . because of the reduced dimensionality , new and interesting transport and optical properties can be observed . in order to explain the experimental data , a large number of theoretical investigations have been performed@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> probably the best known quantum well configuration consists of regions of gaas which act as wells of conduction electrons , separated by regions of ga@xmath3al@xmath4as which act as barriers . </S>",
    "<S> the application of magnetic field perpendicular to the quantum wells is expected to provide further band - structure data and binding energy information . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the theoretical calculations demands reliable analytical and numerical techniques . in this study </S>",
    "<S> we are motivated to analyze the binding energies of the ground and excited states of a hydrogenic donor in a 2d electron gas . here , with the help of a scaled mixed variational method </S>",
    "<S> , we compute the energy levels of a 2d hydrogenic atom in the presence of a magnetic field of arbitrary strength , we compare our results with those obtained by numerical computation and with the shifted @xmath2 method @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian describing the electromagnetic interaction between a conduction electron and a donor impurity center when a constant magnetic field b is applied perpendicular to the x - y plane can be written as    @xmath5    where we have written the vector potential * a * = @xmath6 in the symmetric gauge . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling constant @xmath7 which measures the ratio between the magnetic energy and coulomb energy , is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the effective mass , @xmath10 the dielectric constant of the host material , @xmath11 is the two - dimensional laplacian , and @xmath12 is the angular momentum operator @xmath13 with eigenvalue @xmath14the units of energy are given in terms of the effective rydberg constant @xmath15 and the effective bohr radius @xmath16 respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the substitution @xmath17 reduces the schrdinger equation @xmath18 to the following second order ordinary differential equation @xmath19 \\psi ( \\rho ) = 0 .   </S>",
    "<S> \\label{ecua}\\ ] ]    exact solutions of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ecua ] ) can not be expressed in closed form in terms of special functions . </S>",
    "<S> there are analytical expressions for the energy for particular values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides numerical and perturbation methods @xcite , different techniques have been used in order to obtain the eigenvalues @xmath22 in equation ( [ ecua ] ) , in particular the two - point pad approximation @xcite    recently , using the shifted 1/n expansion , mustafa @xcite has computed the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 energy levels for a 2d donor impurity in the presence of a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the shifted @xmath2 and pad methods are very powerful in computing the energy spectra but fail in giving a reasonable simple wave function and general criteria for the lower bound of energy values . in the present article </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the problem using a scaled two - terms mixed - basis variational approach . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with those obtained using the schwartz @xcite interpolation technique , as well as the shifted @xmath2 method ; showing that our results fit very well to those computed numerically for any range of values of the magnetic strength @xmath26 .    in order to apply the variational method to our problem @xcite , we look for a trial wave function . </S>",
    "<S> since equation ( [ ecua ] ) reduces to the hydrogen atom equation when @xmath27 we can consider as a basis for @xmath28 the hydrogen wave functions @xmath29 since @xmath30 , we obtain a lower bound of the energy for small values of the parameter @xmath31 the solution of equation ( [ ecua ] ) when @xmath32 is    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is a normalization constant , and l(a , b , x ) are the laguerre polynomials@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the energy spectrum in the zero - field limit takes the form @xmath35    conversely , for large values of @xmath7 a good trial basis is that of the spherical oscillator . in this case the solution of equation ( [ ecua ] ) has the form @xmath36 and in the high - field limit , the energy levels are @xmath37    if we attempt to apply the variational method using the hydrogen atom basis , we will obtain good agreement with the accurate results for small values of @xmath7 but this approach fails for large @xmath20 even if we consider a many term basis . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous situation occurs when we use the oscillator basis , in which case we obtain a good agreement for large @xmath20 but the convergence is very slow for small values of @xmath20 @xcite . in order to solve this problem </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a mixed - basis approach . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to use as trial function , for any quantum level , a linear combination of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the corresponding hydrogen and oscillator wave functions associated with the quantum level in question ; @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constants to be calculated . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noticing that our mixed basis is not orthogonal under the inner product @xmath43 we proceed to minimize the expectation value @xmath44 with the normalization condition , @xmath45    applying the variational approach to the basis coefficients @xmath46 we reduce our problem to that of solving the matrix equation    @xmath47 c_{j}=0 , \\label{var}\\ ] ]    whence after substituting the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) into ( [ var ] ) , and taking into account the separated differential equation ( [ ecua ] ) we obtain the matrix equation , @xmath48 where @xmath49 where the lowest value of @xmath50 will be the energy of the level . since we obtain a second order equation for @xmath51 we can analytically compute the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this approach is twofold . </S>",
    "<S> first , because of variational approximation , the eigenvalues satisfy the inequality @xmath52 and therefore we have a lower bound for our energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> second , we obtain a relatively simple expression for the normalized eigenfunctions .    instead of restricting ourselves to the the energy values obtained from ( [ var ] ) via the mixed - basis variational method , we can improve the accuracy of the energy with the help of the virial theorem . using this technique , after re - scaling the radial parameter @xmath53 we have that @xmath54 and the matrix terms associated with @xmath55 and the second derivative become @xmath56 @xmath57 then , with the help of the virial theorem for a coulomb and a radial oscillator potential , @xmath58 @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath60 is the kinetic energy term , the re - scaled hamiltonian reduces to @xmath61 with @xmath62 in order to compute the quantum energy values , we proceed to compute the lowest eigenvalue of the matrix equation given by @xmath63 which takes the form @xmath64 since the components of @xmath65 depend on the scale parameter @xmath66 , @xmath50 is a function of @xmath66 , and the optimal value for @xmath66 can be obtained computing the minimum for @xmath67 , which reduces to solving the algebraic equation @xmath68 then , we can substitute the value of @xmath69 , obtained after solving ( [ vari ] ) , into ( [ scaled ] ) and obtain an analytic expression for the scaled wave functions . as illustration of the mixed - basis method , we present two different expansions of the ground state of th 2d hydrogen hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the energy against @xmath70 as the horizontal scale .    for comparison , the numerical computations of the energy spectra associated with equation ( [ ecua ] ) </S>",
    "<S> are carried out with the help of the schwartz method @xcite which is a generalization of the mesh point technique for numerical approximation of functions . </S>",
    "<S> this method gives highly accurate results given a thoughtful choice of the reference function . </S>",
    "<S> for equation ( [ ecua ] ) we chose as the interpolation function @xmath71 where @xmath72.\\ ] ] here @xmath73 is a zero of @xmath74 , @xmath75 is a zero of its derivative , and @xmath76 is the step of the quadratic mesh . here , as illustration of the mixed - basis method </S>",
    "<S> , we present two different expansions of the ground state of the 2d hydrogen hamiltonian    figures 1 , 3 , and 5 compare the variational results with those obtained numerically and with the help of the shifted @xmath2 method .    </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that even for a two term mixed basis a good fitting is obtained in the weak and strong field regimes . </S>",
    "<S> one of the bases gives a reasonable good fitting in the intermediate region . </S>",
    "<S> a better fit is obtained with the help of the scaled variational method . </S>",
    "<S> we also have that for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states the mixed - basis variational approach gives very good results .    examining figs . 1 , 3 and 5 , it is not obvious which technique gives the most accurate results for computing the hydrogen energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> however , figures 2 , 4 and 6 show that the shifted @xmath2 method always gives results below the the numerical energy levels . among the three analytic methods , figures 2 , 4 and 6 show that the scaled variational method gives the most close to numerical results even for large values of @xmath77 </S>",
    "<S> .    it would be interesting to apply the mixed - basis technique as well as the scaled variational method for the 2d hydrogen problem when relativistic effects are not negligible . </S>",
    "<S> this will be the object of a forthcoming publication . </S>"
