    "note that the first of these operators is the hole density operator itself : @xmath118 the quantity we are interested in is therefore the diagonal correlation function @xmath119 with @xmath120 .",

    "in the numerical calculations we have included paths up to length 5 which gives a set of 485 path variables @xmath83 .",

    "3 . note that we obtain discrete spectra because we have neglected all self - energies . in the figures we have introduced lorentzians with a small artificial linewidth .",
    "the main doping dependence of the spectra is found in the intensity which is proportional to the hole concentration .",
    "this follows from the assumption of independent hole motion and a doping - independent spin background ( rigid - band picture ) . within these approximations",
    "all matrix - elements in ( [ matrix_kumdef ] ) are essentially proportional to the hole concentration @xmath62 . from ( [ proj_glsys ] )",
    "it is seen that therefore all correlation functions @xmath138 are proportional to @xmath62 .    for smaller momentum the spectral weight",
    "is mainly concentrated in a peak near @xmath139 . with increasing momentum we find a transfer of spectral weight to higher energies .",
    "the figures for different values of @xmath2 show that the broad structures observed in the spectra for large momenta scale with @xmath0 , e.g. , the maximum spectral weight in the charge - response function at @xmath140 remains at energies of about @xmath141 independent of @xmath2 .",
    "this scaling behavior will be discussed in the following sections .",

    "4 . shows a comparison of our data for @xmath142 with ed data for @xmath143 taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that even for this large hole concentration we observe a qualitatively good agreement with our spectra : both results show the weight transfer to higher energies with increasing momentum and a broad continuum of excitations at large momenta .",
    "differences may be either due to the small number of sites in the numerical calculations ( which leads to an energy gap in all spectra and other finite - size effects ) or due to the neglection of relaxation processes ( which would produce finite linewidths ) and fermi - surface effects ( which would affect the low - energy spectrum for non - zero doping ) in the present calculation .",

    "they are supposed to coincide with the mir structures observed in optical spectra of high-@xmath13 superconductors being located at 0.20.5 ev ( for @xmath145 0.5 ev , @xmath146 0.150.2 ev ) , see e.g.@xcite .    within the present calculation we do not obtain a drude - like contribution to @xmath22 since eq .",
    "( [ optcon ] ) is valid for non - zero frequency only , i.e. , it does not include the diamagnetic part of the current .",
    "( due to the neglection of the self - energies which excludes scattering processes of the quasiparticle states and the assumption of independent hole motion the drude contribution would have the form @xmath147 . )",
    "so the present calculation can not account for analytical features as , e.g. , the drop - off of the drude peak of finite @xmath30 .    comparing our results with numerical data ( at higher doping ) we again observe reasonable agreement e.g. with the ed results from ref.@xcite for @xmath148 .    2      for the interpretation of the calculated spectra",
    "one can consider the one - hole spectrum of the hamiltonian within our approximation . from the diagonalization of the one - hole problem in the subspace of path operators @xmath83 one obtains several bands for the spin - bag quasiparticles .",
    "as is well known , the lowest band has a minimum at @xmath134 and a bandwidth of about 2@xmath1 .",
    "it corresponds to a quasiparticle with s - like symmetry .",
    "the spin - bag states in the higher bands have nodes in the coefficients @xmath87 ( compare ( [ stoeropdot2 ] ) ) .",
    "note , however , that a classification according to angular momentum ( p , d , f and so on ) is not appropriate at least for longer paths because the path states @xmath83 do not obey simple rotational symmetry .",
    "the total number of one - particle states is of course equal to the number of considered path variables . increasing the maximum path length",
    "@xmath149 adds essentially many non - s - like states to the spectrum which have energies between the s - like states .",
    "so our results do not depend strongly on the maximum path length beyond @xmath150 .",
    "the low - energy peak at small , but finite momenta is caused by excitations within the lowest quasiparticle band . these excitations are treated correctly here only for the limit @xmath136 since we have neglected changes of the fermi surface with doping .",
    "the next structures at low energies arise from transitions between the first and second / third quasiparticle band , i.e. , from the s - like groundstate to p - like states .",
    "these structures are especially visible at small momentum transfer , i.e. , in the optical conductivity , see the discussion below .",
    "the high - energy part of the spectra corresponds to excitations to higher bands .",
    "so our calculation supports the discussion given in ref.@xcite where only the two low - lying states have been considered in a simplified analytical calculation for the main peak found in the optical spectrum .",
    "we want to emphasize that taking into account all string states ( up to a truncation length ) as done in the present work reproduces not only this main peak but the incoherent continuum at energies up to @xmath151 also found in numerical work .",
    "so we have mapped the charge excitations for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model ( [ h_tj ] ) at small hole concentration to transitions between bands of non - interacting spin - bag quasiparticles .",
    "( not taken into account are changes of the fermi surface of these quasiparticles with doping and scattering of the quasiparticle states . )",
    "the different scaling behavior of @xmath152 ( for large @xmath153 ) and @xmath22 with @xmath2 arises from the internal structure of the spin - bag quasiparticles .",
    "the width of the lowest band as well as low excitation energies scale primarily with @xmath1 , i.e. , the excitation energies can be written as @xmath154 with @xmath155 .",
    "therefore the excitation from the ground state to the first excited state has an energy of order @xmath1 as seen in the optical conductivity . at large @xmath153 the energies of the structures in the density response scale with @xmath0",
    "this can be understood from the following qualitative arguments : at large @xmath153 the operator @xmath99 couples the ground state to higher excited states of the quasiparticle .",
    "this coupling depends on @xmath2 since the quasiparticle size changes with @xmath2 .",
    "( mapping the localized hole problem onto its continuum version@xcite one finds that the path coefficients decrease exponentially with a length scale proportional to @xmath156 . )",
    "thus the spatial distance of the real - space nodes in the coefficients @xmath87 increases with @xmath2 ( for fixed @xmath157 ) , in other words , for a fixed spatial node distance the excitation number @xmath76 increases with @xmath2 . therefore with increasing @xmath2 the operator @xmath99 ( for fixed @xmath153 ) couples to higher quasiparticle states .",
    "this results in structures scaling with @xmath0 in the density response function for large @xmath153 .",
    "it is worth noting that the non - s - like states of the quasiparticle play an important role for the charge dynamics considered here .",
    "neglecting them , i.e. considering all paths with the same length as one dynamical variable , would be a bad approximation .",
    "however , for the one - particle dynamics these states do nearly not contribute to the spectrum : if one calculates the one - hole spectral function in the subspace of path operators then only the s - like states carry considerable spectral weight .",
    "the reason for this behavior lies in the symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "in the present paper we have studied the charge dynamics in weakly doped antiferromagnets described by the @xmath0-@xmath1 model at zero temperature .",
    "our ansatz for the ground - state wave - function@xcite includes mobile hole quasiparticles .",
    "background spin fluctuations have been neglected .",
    "thus the ground state has antiferromagnetic long - range order independent of hole doping .",
    "we have used this ground state together with a cumulant version of mori - zwanzig projection technique to calculate dynamical charge correlation functions .",
    "we find structures at lower energies scaling with @xmath1 for zero and small momentum and a transfer of spectral weight to higher energies with increasing momentum . at intermediate and large momenta",
    "the density response spectrum consists of a broad continuum at energies of order @xmath0 .",
    "the calculations do not cover a fermi - surface related low - energy response ( including a drude - like peak in the optical conductivity ) .",
    "our results for the density response function as well as the optical conductivity are in reasonable agreement with recent numerical data obtained by exact diagonalizations@xcite ( see figs . 3 - 5 )",
    ". however , these numerical calculations have been done for large hole concentrations ( e.g. , 25% ) where only short - range magnetic order is present .",
    "in contrast , our calculations are based on magnetic long - range order and neglect background spin fluctuations .",
    "thus we conclude that the fact whether the quasiparticles move in a long - range ordered background or not does not have an essential influence on the charge response of the system at higher energies .",
    "the dynamics is determined by the local antiferromagnetic order in the vicinity of the hole quasiparticles , i.e. , the magnetic correlation length has to be of the order of the quasiparticle size .",
    "more precisely , our treatment is valid with antiferromagnetic order on length scales of the longest path variables included in the calculation ( here 5 lattice constants ) .",
    "note here that the magnetic correlation length in the high-@xmath13 materials is about 5 lattice constants for @xmath148 and about 2.5 lattice constants for @xmath143 differing somewhat for different compounds .",
    "( numerical simulations for the @xmath0-@xmath1 and related models yield similiar values although precise data can not be obtained because of the restricted system sizes . )",
    "a remaining task would be to include doping dependent background spin fluctuations in our ansatz for the wave operator @xmath45 as done in the static calculations of ref.@xcite .",
    "the scattering of quasiparticles at spin fluctuations would cause a decay of the excited quasiparticle states and provide lifetime broadening of the lines in the response functions . from this",
    "we do not expect drastic changes in the response functions for larger energies .",
    "a second possible improvement concerns the inclusion of fermi - surface related response at low energies , work along this line is in progress .",
    "in this appendix we show how to evaluate cumulants with an exponential ansatz for the wave operator @xmath45 .",
    "the basic relation is @xmath158 with @xmath159 being arbitrary operators .",
    "note that on the l.h.s .",
    "the operators @xmath160 , @xmath72 and @xmath159 are subject to cumulant ordering whereas on the r.h.s .",
    "only the @xmath159 operators are cumulant entities . however , the cumulants on the r.h.s .",
    "are formed with the new wavefunction @xmath161 .",
    "( [ kumrel1 ] ) can be proven either by integrating infinitesimal transformations @xmath162 and using properties of cumulants@xcite or by explicitly using the definition of cumulant expectation values . here",
    "we demonstrate the second way .",
    "we start from the definition of cumulant expectation values@xcite for a product of arbitrary operators @xmath159 and an arbitrary state @xmath163 : @xmath164_{\\xi=\\eta=0 \\atop \\lambda_i=0\\,\\forall\\,i}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last expression can be interpreted as a series expansion of the term in brackets @xmath165 $ ] with respect to @xmath77 and @xmath166 around 0 : @xmath167 in the last equation we have reintroduced ( generalized ) cumulants , now formed with the bra state @xmath168 and the ket state @xmath169 . with @xmath170 we obtain the desired result ( [ kumrel1 ] ) .",
