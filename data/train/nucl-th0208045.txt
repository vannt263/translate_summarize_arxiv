    "in this paper @xcite ,  we obtain a semi - phenomenological relativistic potential model for nucleon - nucleon interactions by using two - body dirac equations of  constraint dynamics @xcite , @xcite and yukawa s theory of meson exchange .  in previous work",
    "long and crater @xcite have derived the two - body dirac equations for all non - derivative lorentz invariant interactions acting together or in any combinations .",
    "they also reduced the two - body dirac equations to coupled schrdinger - like equations in which the potentials appear as covariant generalizations of the standard spin dependent interactions appearing in the early phenomenological works in this area @xcite based on the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "this allows us to take advantage of earlier work done by other people on the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "in particular we use the variable phase method developed by calogero and degasparis @xcite for computation of the phase shift from the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation , presenting a new derivation for the case of coupled equations .",
    "our potentials for different angular momentum states are constructed from combinations of several different meson exchanges .",
    "furthermore , our potentials , as well as the whole equations , are local , yet at the same time covariant .",
    "this contrasts our approach with other relativistic schemes such as those by gross and others @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to see if the meson exchanges we use are adequate to describe the elastic nucleon - nucleon interactions from low energy to high energy ( @xmath9350 ) when using them together with two - body dirac equations of constraint dynamics .",
    "although numerous relativistic approaches have been used in the nucleon - nucleon scattering problem , none of the other approaches have been tested nonperturbatively in both qed and qcd as they have been with the two - body dirac equations of  constraint dynamics @xcite . unlike the earlier local two - body approaches of breit @xcite ,",
    "the relativistic spin corrections need not be treated only perturbatively .",
    "this means that we can use nonperturbative methods ( numerical methods ) to solve the two - body dirac equations .",
    "this is a very important advantage of the constraint two - body dirac equations ( ctbde ) .",
    "the successful numerical tests in qed and qcd gives us confidence that they may be appropriate relativistic equations for phase shift analysis of nucleon - nucleon scattering .    in section",
    "ii  we introduce the two - body dirac equations of constraint dynamics .",
    "in section iii we obtain the pauli reduction of the two - body dirac equations to coupled schrdinger - like equations .",
    "we go a step further than that achieved in the paper of long and crater in that we eliminate the first derivative terms that appear in the schrdinger - like equation .",
    "this is relatively simple for the case of uncoupled equations but not so for the case of coupled schrdinger - like equations .",
    "the reason we perform this extra reduction is that the formulae we use for the phase shift analysis , the variable phase method developed by calogero , has been worked out already for coupled equations , but ones in which the first derivative terms are absent .",
    "this step then becomes an important part of the formalism , allowing us take advantage of previous work . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the phase shift methods used in our numerical calculations , which include phase shift equations for uncoupled and coupled states and the phase shift equations with coulomb potential . in section v we present the models used in our calculations , including the expressions for the scalar , vector and pseudoscalar interactions , and the way they enter into our two - body dirac equations with the mesons used in our fits . in section vi we present the results we have acheived and in section vii are the summaries and conclusions of our work .",
    "the two - body dirac equations that we will use for studying nucleon - nucleon interaction bear a close relation to the single particle equation proposed by dirac in 1928 @xcite@xmath10 @xmath11   \\psi = e\\psi . \\label{a}\\ ] ] for interactions that transforms as a time - component of a four vector and world scalar we have @xmath12 .",
    "of course , the single particle dirac equation is not suitable to describe systems such as the mesons , ( quarkonium ) , muonium , positronium , the deuteron and nucleon - nucleon scattering because the particles may have equal or near equal mass .    the earliest attempt at putting both particles on an equal footing was in 1929 by g. breit @xcite@xcite@xcite@xmath13however , the breit equations do not retain manifest covariant form and in qed the equations can not be treated nonperturbatively beyond the coulomb term @xcite .",
    "there have been many attempts to by pass the problems of the breit equation and also of the full four dimensional bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "these are discussed in a number of different contexts in @xcite .",
    "the approach of the ctbde provides a manifestly covariant yet three dimensional detour around many of the problems that hamper the implementation and application of breit s two - body dirac equations as well as the full four dimensional bethe - salpeter equation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , as mentioned above , the approach can by a pauli reduction give us a local schrdinger - like equation .",
    "the ctbde make use of dirac s relativistic hamiltonian formalism . in a series of papers ( in addition to those cited above",
    "see also @xcite ) crater and van alstine have incorporated todorov s effective particle idea developed in his quasipotential approach @xcite into the framework of dirac s hamiltonian constraint mechanics @xcite for a description of two body systems .",
    "their approach yields manifestly covariant coupled dirac equations .",
    "the standard reduction of the breit equation to a schrdinger - like equation for qed yields highly singular operators ( like @xmath14 functions and attractive @xmath15 potentials ) that can only be treated perturbatively . in the treatment of the ctbde for qed @xcite , for example ,",
    "one finds that all the operators are quantum mechanically well defined so that one can therefore use nonperturbative techniques ( analytic as well as numerical ) to obtain solutions of bound state problems and scattering .",
    "( a quantum mechanically well defined potential is one no more singular than @xmath16 .",
    "if it is not quantum mechanically well defined , it can only be treated perturbatively . )",
    "although it is encouraging that good results have been obtained for qed and qcd meson spectroscopy , that is no guarantee that the formalism so developed will lead to effective potentials in the case of nucleon - nucleon scattering that render reasonable fits to the phase shift data .    using techniques developed by dirac to handle constraints in quantum mechanics and the method developed by crater and van alstine , one can derive the two - body dirac equations for eight nonderivative lorentz invariant interactions acting separately or together @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these include world scalar , four vector and pseudoscalar interactions among others .",
    "we can also reduce the two - body dirac equations to coupled schrdinger - like equations even with all these interactions acting together . before we test this method in nuclear physics in the phase shift analysis of the nucleon - nucleon scattering problems we review highlights of the constraint formalism and the form of the two - body dirac equations .",
    "dirac @xcite extended hamiltonian mechanics to include conjugate variables related by constraints of the form @xmath17 . for @xmath18 constraints ,",
    "we may write @xmath19 with these constraints the hamiltonian of the system ( with sum over repeated indices ) @xmath20 is not unique .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian @xmath21includes the constraints @xmath22 in which @xmath23 is the legendre hamiltonian obtained from the lagrangian by means of a legendre transformation .",
    "the @xmath24 may be functions of conjugate variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the equation of motion for any arbitrary function @xmath27 ( without explicit time dependence ) of the conjugate variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 is then @xmath28.\\ ] ] dirac called the conditional equality , @xmath29 a  weak  equality meaning the constraints @xmath30 must not be applied before working out the poisson brackets .",
    "dirac called @xmath31 a nonconditional equality or a  strong  equality .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath28=[g , h+\\lambda_{n}\\phi_{n}]=[g , h]+\\lambda _",
    "{ n}[g,\\phi_{n}]+[g,\\lambda_{n}]\\phi_{n}\\approx\\lbrack g , h]+\\lambda_{n}[g,\\phi_{n}]\\ ] ] for @xmath30 .    in the two body system , we have two constraints @xmath32 .  for spinless particles",
    "they are taken to be the generalized mass shell constraints of the two particles @xcite,@xcite , namely @xmath33@xmath34 where @xmath35    dirac extended his idea of handling constraints in classical mechanics to quantum mechanics by replacing the classical constraints @xmath36 with quantum wave equations @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are conjugate variables .",
    "thus the quantum forms for each individual particle constraint become schrdinger - type equations @xcite @xmath40  the total hamiltonian @xmath41 from these constraints alone is @xmath42 ( with @xmath43 as lagrange multipliers ) .  in order",

    "\\label{3}\\ ] ] this condition guarantees that with the dirac hamiltonian , the system evolves such that the  motion  is constrained to the surface of the mass shell described by the constraints of @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath50@xcite,@xcite@xmath51 as described most recently in @xcite this requires that @xmath52 ( a kind of relativistic newton s third law ) with the transverse coordinate defined by @xmath53 and total momentum by@xmath54    to complete our review of the spinless case ( @xcite ) and establish notation we introduce the transverse relative momentum@xmath55@xmath56 where the cm energy eigenvalue @xmath57 is defined from @xmath58 taking the difference of the two constraints , @xmath59 we can show that the longitudinal or time - like components of the momenta in the cm system have the invariant forms @xmath60 thus on these states @xmath61  we obtain @xmath62 and indicates the presence of exact relativistic two - body kinematics .",
    "( by this statement we mean that classically @xmath63 , would imply @xmath64 .",
    "note that both of the constituent invariant cm energies @xmath65 and @xmath66 are positive for positive total cm energy @xmath57 greater than the square root of @xmath67 .  this is a direct consequence of the eq.([cmpt ] ) which in turn depends on the third lawcondition necessary for compatibility . in our scattering applications below this guarantees that nucleons can not scatter into a final state having an overall positive energy but with constituent positive and negative energy nucleons .    in the center - of - momentum system , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and the relative energy and time are removed from the problem .",
    "the equation for the relative motion is then @xmath70 which is in the form of a non - relativistic schrdinger equation ( with @xmath71 ) .",
    "thus the relativistic treatment of the two - body problem for spinless particles gives a form that has the simplicity of the ordinary non - relativistic two - body schrdinger equation and yet maintains relativistic covariance .",
    "spin and different types of interactions can be included in a more complete framework @xcite and will be reviewed later in this section .",
    "in addition to exact relativistic kinematical corrections , eq.([eq : eig ] ) displays through the potential @xmath72 relativistic dynamical corrections .",
    "these corrections include dependence of the potential on the cm energy @xmath57 and on the nature of the interaction . for spinless particles interacting by way of a world scalar interaction @xmath73 , one finds @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 while for ( time - like ) vector interactions ( described by @xmath76 ) , one finds @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 for combined space - like and time - like vector interactions ( that reproduce the correct energy spectrum for scalar qed @xcite ) @xmath79^{2}. \\label{faiaa1}\\ ] ] the variables @xmath80 and @xmath81  ( which both approach the reduced mass @xmath82 in the nonrelativistic limit ) are called the relativistic reduced mass and energy of the fictitious particle of relative motion .",
    "these were first introduced by todorov @xcite in his quasipotential approach .",
    "thus , in the nonrelativistic limit , @xmath72 approaches @xmath83 for combined interactions@xmath10 in the relativistic case , the dynamical corrections to @xmath72 referred to above include both quadratic additions to @xmath73 and @xmath76 as well as cm energy dependence through @xmath80 and @xmath84 the two logarithm terms at the end of eq.([faiaa1 ] ) are due to the transverse or space - like part of the potential .  without those terms",
    ", spectral results would not agree with the standard ( but more complex ) spinless breit and darwin approaches ( see references in @xcite including @xcite ) .",
    "eq.([eq : eig ] ) provides a useful way to obtain the solution of the relativistic two - body problem for spinless particles in scalar and vector interactions and as reviewed below has been extended to include spin .  in that case",
    "they have been found to give a very good account of the bound state spectrum of both light and heavy mesons using reasonable input quark potentials .",
    "these ways of putting the invariant potential functions for scalar @xmath73 and vector @xmath76 interactions into @xmath72 will be used in this paper for the case of two spin one - half particles ( see ( [ a - a ] ) to ( [ s1 - 2 ] ) and ( [ e1-b ] ) to ( [ m22 ] ) below ) .",
    "these exact forms are not unique but were motivated by work of crater and van alstine in classical field theory and sazdjian in quantum field theory @xcite . other , closely related structures will also be used .",
    "these structures play a crucial role in this paper since they give us a nonperturbative framework in which @xmath73 and @xmath76 appear in the equations we use .",
    "this structure has been successfully tested ( numerically ) in qed ( positronium and muonium bound states ) and is found to give excellent results when applied to the highly relativistic circumstances of qcd ( quark model for mesons ) .",
    "an important question we wish to answer in this paper is whether such structures are also valid in the two - body nucleon - nucleon problem .",
    "this is an important test since the quadratic forms ( see e.g. eqs.([scl ] ) , ( [ faiaa ] ) ) that appear could very well distort possible fits based on yukawa - type potentials with strong couplings .    before going on to describe the constraints for two spin - one - half particles we mention an important but often overlooked aspect of the foundations of the generalized mass shell contraint equations given in ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "it involves their derivation from an alternative starting point .",
    "in addition to the connection with the bethe - salpeter equation described in @xcite ,  there exists a connection between constraint dynamics and wigner s early formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite . in particular ,  polyzou @xcite  has demonstrated that the assumption of both poincar invariance and manifest lorentz covariance forces the scalar product for quantum mechanical state vectors to be interaction dependent .",
    "so , whereas for a free particle the kernal involved in the scalar product has the form @xmath85 in cases of interactions the self - adjoint nature of the kernal demands the forms @xmath86  with compatible constraints ( a related use of such delta functions to construct the state vectors themselves is discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "we continue our review in this section by introducing the two - body dirac equations of constraint dynamics .",
    "the dirac equations for two free spin - one - half particles are @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the product of the two single - particle dirac wave functions ( these equations are equivalent to the free one - body dirac equation ) .",

    "form one uses reduction brackets that involve anticommutators for odd numbers of theta  matrices and commutators for even numbers of  theta  matrices and coordinate and momentum operators .",
    "this property follows from the relation of the theta  matrices to the grassmann variables used in the pseudoclassical form of the constraints ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these fundamental anticommutation relations guarantee that the dirac operators @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the square root of the mass shell operators @xmath93 and @xmath94 .  differencing these implies that the relative momentum @xmath39 in eq.([pq ] ) satisfies @xmath95    writing @xmath96 and @xmath97 in terms of the total and relative momenta we obtain @xmath98 the projected theta  matrices then satisfy @xmath99   _ { + }   & = 1,\\nonumber\\\\ \\left [   \\theta_{i}\\cdot\\hat{p},\\theta_{i\\bot}^{\\mu}\\right ]   _ { + }   &   = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 defining @xmath101 and @xmath102 the above two - body dirac equations become @xmath103 which have the form of single free particle dirac equations .",

    "a particularly important combination occurs for electromagnetic inteactions .  while time - and space- like vector interactions",

    "j ) possesses a great variety of equivalent forms that are rearrangements of its two coupled dirac equations ( hence is directly related to many previously - known quantum descriptions of the relativistic two - body system ) .",
    "these structures play an essential role in the success of this approach to both qcd and qed bound states .",
    "what is noteworthy in the latter appllication is that one need only identify the non - relativistic parts , i.e. the lowest order forms of @xmath76 and @xmath73 .",
    "the spin - dependent and covariant structure of the two - body dirac formalism then automatically stamps out the correct semirelativistic spin dependent and spin independent corrections and provides well defined higher order relativistic corrections as well .",
    "in addition the constraint formalism , although rooted in classical mechanics , has close connections to the bethe - salpeter equation of quantum field theory @xcite and with wigner s formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics as a symmetry of quantum theory @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have shown that these two - body dirac equations may provide a reasonable account of the nucleon - nucleon scattering data when combined with the meson exchange model .",
    "what makes this result important is that it is accomplished with a local and covariant formulation of the two - body problem .",
    "what makes this unique is that this approach has been thoroughly tested in a nonperturbative context for both qed and qcd bound states .",
    "it is not a given that success in one or even both areas would imply that the formalism would do well in another .  in particular , the fits could have easily been disastrous given that the minimal coupling idea we have used ( based in part on the earlier work on the quasipotential approach of todorov ) .",
    "the reason for some doubt is that these minimal coupling forms ( generalized to the scalar interactions as well as the vector ) lead to the scalar and vector potentials appearing squared .  because of the size of the coupling constants , the deviation from the standard effective potentials could have been considerable in all cases",
    "there are other nonperturbative structures that appear in the pauli reduction of our equations to schrdinger - like form ( typical of what appears in the pauli reduction of the one - body dirac equation ) that could also have prevented any reasonable results .",
    "so the general agreement we obtained with the data is very encouraging that this approach could be extended to include more general interactions .",
    "an important step in our reduction was that we put the equation in a form for which we can apply the techniques which have been already developed for the schrdinger - like system in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "this required that we get rid of first derivative terms .",
    "for the uncoupled states , it is pretty straightforward . for the coupled states we used a different spin - matirx approach that works for both the uncoupled and coupled states simultaneously .",
    "we then tested several models by using the variable phase methods .",
    "we found it most  convenient to put all the angular momentum barrier terms in the potentials , and change all the phase shift equations to the form of @xmath73 state - like phase shift equations ( see eqs.([mes],[psa],[psb],[psc ] ) ) .",

    "<S> an important question we wish to address is whether or not the two - body nucleon - nucleon scattering problem can be reasonably described in this approach as well . </S>",
    "<S> this test involves a number of related problems . </S>",
    "<S> first we must reduce our two - body dirac equations exactly to a schrdinger - like equation in such a way that allows us to use techniques to solve them already developed for schrdinger - like systems in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> related to this we present a new derivation of calogero s variable phase shift differential equation for coupled schrdinger - like equations . </S>",
    "<S> then we determine if the use of  nine meson exchanges in our equations give a reasonable fit to the experimental scattering phase shifts for @xmath0 scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the data involves seven angular momentum states including the singlet states @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the triplet states @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> two models that we have tested give us a fairly good fit . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters obtained by fitting the @xmath0 experimental scattering phase shift give a fairly good prediction for most of the @xmath8 experimental scattering phase shifts examined ( for the singlet states @xmath1 , @xmath3 and triplet states @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) . thus the two - body dirac equations of constraint dynamics present us with a fit that encourages the exploration of a more realistic model . </S>",
    "<S> we outline generalizations of the meson exchange model for invariant potentials that may possibly improve the fit . </S>"
