    "hydrogen burning , the conversion of four protons into an alpha particle in the interior of stars , is the most important energy source in the universe and it is also responsible for the existence of several chemical elements . besides the pp - chains powering e.g. our sun , catalytic reactions cycles , like the various cno cycles play the major role in hydrogen burning @xcite .",
    "depending on the temperature and chemical composition of the stellar plasma , different cno cycles can take place involving various isotopes of carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and fluorine .",
    "the @xmath0o(p,@xmath1)@xmath2f reaction , which competes with the @xmath3-emission in @xmath0o(p,@xmath3)@xmath4n @xcite is the starting point of the third cno cycle .",
    "this cycle is activated in various stellar conditions such as red giant and asymptotic giant stars and classical novae .",
    "the abundances of fluorine and the heavy oxygen isotopes are strongly related to the operation of this cycle and therefore the rates of the participating reactions must be known .    below 1.5mev",
    "the @xmath0o(p,@xmath1)@xmath2f reaction is characterized by many broad and narrow resonances .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependence of the @xmath0o(p,@xmath1)@xmath2f thermonuclear reaction rate shows a complicated picture .",
    "the rate depends on the direct capture component as well as on the narrow low energy resonances and the tails of the higher energy broad resonances ( see e.g. fig.10 in ref.@xcite for the contribution of the different components to the reaction rate ) .",
    "an r - matrix fit to the experimental data is therefore inevitable to provide reaction rates at various temperatures for stellar models .",
    "the first cross section measurement of @xmath0o(p,@xmath1)@xmath2f was carried out several decades ago by c. rolfs in a wide energy range between 300kev and 1.9mev @xcite . after the turn of the century",
    ", several experimental studies were carried out mostly concentrating on the low energy region below about 500kev @xcite .",
    "( the only exception was the work of a. kontos _",
    "@xcite which extended up to 1.6mev . ) the comparison of the new precise data with the results of @xcite revealed some discrepancy both in the absolute scale and the energy dependence of the cross section at the lowest energies studied by @xcite .    in most of the previous experiments",
    "the cross section of @xmath0o(p,@xmath1)@xmath2f was measured with in - beam @xmath1-spectroscopy : the prompt @xmath1-radiation from the formed @xmath2f nucleus was detected .",
    "the complicated level scheme of @xmath2f ( see e.g. fig.1 . in ref.@xcite ) implies that the detection of many primary and secondary transitions is necessary for the cross section determination .",
    "this represents a source of uncertainty in the experiments . in order to provide the astrophysically relevant total cross section , all the transitions",
    "must be measured and care must be taken to measure even the weakest @xmath1-lines .",
    "the angular distributions of all the @xmath1-emissions must also be known . moreover , in order to measure low cross sections , close target - detector geometries are typically used leading to strong true coincidence summing effects .",
    "all these experimental difficulties can be avoided by the application of the activation method , which was used by only two experiments before at energies below 400kev @xcite .",
    "the reaction product of @xmath0o(p,@xmath1)@xmath2f is radioactive , decays by positron emission with a half - life of 109.77@xmath50.05minutes @xcite .",
    "the decay is entirely to the ground state of @xmath2o , no @xmath1-radiation follows thus the decay .",
    "the emission of the 511kev @xmath1-radiation following the positron annihilation , on the other hand , allows the measurement of the decay by @xmath1-detection . by measuring the @xmath2f activity",
    "the number of reaction product and therefore the total reaction cross section can be determined directly .",
    "the activation measurement of @xmath0o(p,@xmath1)@xmath2f provides therefore an independent means of cross section determination which can be used to check earlier experimental data and provide a constraint for r - matrix calculations regarding the total reaction cross section .",
    "the aim of the present work is therefore to measure the @xmath0o(p,@xmath1)@xmath2f cross section with the activation method in a wide energy range .",
    "the next section provides detailed information about the experimental technique , the results are presented in sec.[sec : results ] while sec.[sec : summary ] provides the summary and conclusions .",
    "solid state oxygen targets were produced by anodic oxidation of tantalum disks in water enriched in @xmath0o . with this technique",
    "ta@xmath6o@xmath7 layers can be produced with well defined ta : o ratio and the targets have high stability under beam bombardment .",
    "the anodization setup was the same as used recently by the luna collaboration for the low energy @xmath0o(p,@xmath1)@xmath2f cross section measurements @xcite .",
    "full details of the anodization device and the preparation procedure have been published by the luna collaboration @xcite , here only the most important features and the differences are summarized .",
    "two water samples were used for the target preparations .",
    "the isotopic abundances of the @xmath8o , @xmath0o and @xmath2o isotopes , respectively , were the following : ( 15.5@xmath50.6)% , ( 77.8@xmath50.6)% and ( 6.7@xmath50.2)% ( sample 1 . ) and ( 39.5@xmath50.6)% , ( 27.4@xmath50.6)% and ( 33.1@xmath50.6)% ( sample 2 . ) .",
    "these values are quoted by the supplier .    applying two different anodization voltages ( 24v and 50v ) ,",
    "targets with two different thicknesses were produced .",
    "altogether seven targets were prepared from the two water samples and with the two thicknesses .",
    "intercomparison of the different targets were done by carrying out activation at the same proton energy on targets with different isotopic composition and/or thickness .    as the determination of the number of target atoms is crucial for the precise cross section measurements ,",
    "different experimental techniques were used to determine this quantity .",
    "first , the ta : o stoichiometry ratio and the thickness of the oxide layer were measured with rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( rbs ) .",
    "the first set of rbs measurements were carried out before the start of the activation experiments at the microbeam setup installed at the 5mv van de graaff accelerator of atomki @xcite .",
    "a 1.6mev @xmath3 beam bombarded the ta@xmath6o@xmath7 targets and the scattered particles were detected by two ion implanted si detectors positioned at 135 and 165 degrees with respect to the beam direction . exploiting the high lateral resolution of the microbeam setup ,",
    "spectra were recorded at several different positions on the target surfaces .",
    "this test proved that the thickness and stoichiometry of the targets are uniform along the whole surface of the targets .",
    "the spectra were analysed using the simnra code @xcite which provided the areal density of the o atoms as well as the ta : o ratio .",
    "a second set of rbs measurement was carried out after the activation experiments using a completely independent setup , namely the activation chamber itself ( i.e. similar beam size and position to the proton beam used for the activations , see below ) . at the tandetron accelerator",
    "a 10mev @xmath8o@xmath9 beam bombarded the ta@xmath6o@xmath7 targets and a si detector built into the activation chamber detected the backscattered ions .",
    "figure [ fig : rbs ] shows typical spectra of the two rbs measurements .",
    "the measured data as well as the fits using the simnra code are shown .",
    "the results of the @xmath8o rbs measurements were in good agreement with the ones obtained with @xmath3-rbs ( see below ) .",
    "the ratio of the ta : o atoms was found to be 0.411@xmath50.015 in agreement with the stoichiometric value of 0.4 .",
    "relevant parts of the rbs spectra of a ta@xmath6o@xmath7 target measured with @xmath3-beam at the microprobe facility ( upper panel ) and with @xmath8o@xmath9 beam in the activation chamber at the tandetron accelerator.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   relevant parts of the rbs spectra of a ta@xmath6o@xmath7 target measured with @xmath3-beam at the microprobe facility ( upper panel ) and with @xmath8o@xmath9 beam in the activation chamber at the tandetron accelerator.,title=\"fig : \" ]    if the ta : o ratio is known , a totally independent target thickness value can be obtained by the measurement of the resonance profile on a suitable nuclear resonance .",
    "we have investigated the target thicknesses also by this method using both @xmath0o and @xmath2o isotope content of the targets .",
    "the e@xmath10=1098kev and e@xmath10=1925kev resonances in the @xmath0o(p,@xmath1)@xmath2f and @xmath2o(p,@xmath1)@xmath11f reactions , respectively , were used to measure the target profiles .",
    "a 100% relative efficiency hpge detector were placed next to the activation chamber at zero degree with its front face about 1 cm distance from the target .",
    "the yield of the strongest transition was used for the measurement of the profiles which was the 937kev transition of the first excited state to the ground state in the case of @xmath2f ( @xmath0o(p,@xmath1)@xmath2f reaction ) and the 197 kev transition of the second excited state to the ground state in the case of @xmath11f ( @xmath2o(p,@xmath1)@xmath11f reaction ) .",

    "the target thickness was obtained from the width of the fitted resonance profile .",
    "]    the uncertainties quoted in the table are statistical only stemming form the fit of the rbs spectra and the resonance profiles .",
    "taking into account only these errors , the two methods are in contradiction . if , however , one includes the uncertainty of the stopping power , the results can be considered to be consistent .",
    "it is difficult to quantify the uncertainty of stopping power in our experiment as the stopping of protons , @xmath3-particles and @xmath8o isotopes should be considered in o and ta , and the related information @xcite in the widely used srim code indicates uncertainties from about 2% up to 6% .",
    "most likely the deviation of the thickness values has its origin in the uncertainty of the stopping power .",
    "therefore , we have adopted the average of the two methods and assigned a conservative 6% uncertainty to the number of target atoms .",
