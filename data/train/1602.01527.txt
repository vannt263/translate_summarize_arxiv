    "fundamental physics of the 21st century will be governed by the search for a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "this will ultimately bring the field of _ cpt_- and lorentz violation more into the focus of high - energy physics .",
    "one of the basic and most essential results obtained in this context is that lorentz violation can arise naturally in closed - string field theory @xcite . besides that",
    ", a violation of lorentz invariance was shown to occur in other realms of high - energy physics or alternative approaches to quantum gravity such as loop quantum gravity @xcite , theories of noncommutative spacetimes @xcite , spacetime foam models @xcite , quantum field theories in backgrounds with nontrivial topologies @xcite , and last but not least , hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "these results have far - reaching consequences .",
    "first , they show that violations of the aforementioned fundamental symmetries may be signals of physics at the planck scale .",
    "second , lorentz invariance is the very base of the established theories , i.e. , the standard model and general relativity .",
    "hence , even if quantum gravity looks totally different from what physicists currently imagine these theories should be subject to precise experimental tests .",
    "this is only possible based on a framework that extends both the standard model and general relativity to tell the experimentalists what effects they may expect to measure .",
    "the most general framework is the standard - model extension ( sme ) @xcite .",
    "the latter is an effective field theory based on the standard model , which comprises all lorentz - violating operators of mass dimension 3 and 4 that can be added to the lagrange density .",
    "the nonminimal sme @xcite additionally includes all higher - dimensional operators . whenever lorentz violation is studied , _ cpt _ violation",
    "is automatically taken into account due to a theorem by greenberg @xcite , which says that in effective field theory _ cpt_-violation implies lorentz noninvariance .",
    "various theoretical investigations of the sme have been carried out at tree - level @xcite and higher - orders in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "these results are important as they demonstrate that the sme is a viable framework to investigate lorentz violation .",
    "therefore , experimental studies are warranted as well where a great deal of sharp experimental bounds on the minimal sme already exist opening the pathway to covering the leading - order operators of the nonminimal sme .",
    "a yearly updated compilation of all constraints can be found in @xcite .    after setting up the particle - physics part of the minimal sme in @xcite the gravity part",
    "was established in @xcite .",
    "one of the most crucial results of the latter paper is that explicit lorentz violation is incompatible with gravity where the incompatibility is due to the bianchi identities of riemannian geometry .",
    "therefore , in a curved background lorentz violation can only be studied consistently when the symmetry is broken spontaneously , cf .",
    "an alternative possibility of circumventing the incompatibility could be to use a geometric concept other than riemannian geometry .",
    "because of that reason , lorentz violation based on finsler geometry @xcite is currently being investigated extensively .",
    "finsler geometry can be regarded as riemannian geometry without the quadratic restriction of line intervals , i.e. , any possible interval obeying certain reasonable properties can be considered .",
    "line intervals can also involve preferred directions on the manifold , which is why this geometric approach is interesting for people studying lorentz violation .    to consider finsler geometry in the sme a reasonable starting point is needed .",
    "general relativity and possible extensions of it reside in the realm of classical physics .",
    "however , the particle - physics part of the sme is a field theory concept , i.e. , one has to map the field theory description to a classical - physics analog .",
    "this was carried out for various cases of the minimal sme @xcite and a number of nonminimal cases @xcite .",
    "the results of these studies are lagrangians for classical , relativistic , pointlike particles including lorentz violation based on the sme . further analyses of these lagrangians or investigations in other sectors of the sme can be found in @xcite .",
    "the classical lagrangians obtained were shown to be related to finsler structures @xcite and can possibly serve to study explicit lorentz violation in curved backgrounds , cf .  @xcite .",
    "the mapping investigated in the papers mentioned above starts at the quantum description of the sme and it ends at the classical regime .",
    "therefore , the motivation of the current article is to answer one question . assuming",
    "that we have the classical lagrangians only and do not know about the field theory description of the sme , is it possible to quantize the classical theory to arrive at the quantum - mechanical hamiltonian based on the sme ?",
    "note that the sme is a relativistic field theory , which allows for obtaining the corresponding low - energy hamiltonian with the foldy - wouthuysen procedure @xcite .",
    "hence , an alternative method could be to expand the relativistic classical lagrangians in the ratio of the velocity and the speed of light and to perform quantization subsequently .",
    "finding out whether or not this method works is the goal of the paper .",
    "in the course of the analysis , the unexpected result is encountered that the classical lagrangians and hamilton functions considered are related by a simple transformation at first order in lorentz violation and at second order in the momenta .",
    "this observation may be interesting and important in practice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we compile all lagrangians obtained in the literature so far .",
    "thereby , the velocity - momentum correspondence and the classical hamilton function is computed for each .",
    "section [ sec : first - quantization ] is dedicated to the first quantization of the results .",
    "all classical momenta are promoted to quantum operators and a suitable _ ansatz _ for a spin structure is introduced .",
    "it is shown that the quantum - mechanical hamilton operators can be obtained consistently . in the leading - order expansion of each lagrangian",
    "is investigated more closely . by doing so ,",
    "we find the simple relation between the lagrangians and the hamilton functions mentioned above . under mild assumptions",
    ", it is shown that this result is valid in general .",
    "subsequently , we apply it to two complicated cases of the minimal fermion sector not considered in the literature so far .",
    "last but not least , all findings are discussed and concluded on in . throughout the paper , natural units with @xmath0 are used unless otherwise stated .",
    "in @xcite the procedure was set up to assign a classical lagrangian to a particular case of the sme fermion sector .",
    "consider a quantum wave packet that is a superposition of plane - wave solutions to the free - field equations with a suitable smearing function . if the smearing function in configuration space is chosen to fall off sufficiently fast outside of a localized region this wave packet is interpreted as a particle in the classical limit .",
    "the physical propagation velocity of the packet corresponds to its group velocity for most cases @xcite .",
    "denoting the four - momentum of a plane wave , which is part of the wave packet , by @xmath1 and the four - velocity of the classical particle by @xmath2 we have the following five equations that govern the mapping procedure :    [ eq : set - equations - lagrangians ] @xmath3\\\\[2ex ] \\label{eq : group - velocity - correspondence }",

    "the second says that the group velocity of the quantum wave packet shall correspond to the three - velocity of the classical particle .",
    "these are three equations , one for each component .",
    "the last follows from the reasonable assumption of an action that is invariant under changes of parameterization . for exhaustive discussions on that procedure we refer to  @xcite .    within the current paper a classical lagrangian @xmath4",
    "shall not be obtained but it is supposed to be the starting point . the aim is to derive the quantum - mechanical hamiltonian from this lagrangian .",
    "to do so , the first step is to obtain the particle energy as a function of velocity for which there are two possibilities . in proper - time parameterization , @xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the three - velocity of the particle . according to @xmath8 we obtain @xmath9",

    ", the hamiltonian has to be computed from the classical energy .",
    "to do so the energy is needed as a function of spatial momentum @xmath11 instead of velocity @xmath7 .",
    "hence , it is necessary to solve @xmath12 with respect to @xmath7 to give replacement rules for the velocity in favor of the momentum .",
    "the result is the classical hamilton function @xmath13 , which forms the basis for quantization . in the forthcoming subsections ,",
    "this procedure will be carried out for all classical lagrangians found for the minimal sme fermion sector .",
    "we will work at first order in lorentz violation and at second order in the momentum or velocity .",
    "for each case of the sme fermion sector there are distinct lagrangians for the particle and the antiparticle solutions .",
    "they are related to each other by the replacement @xmath14 . in this article",
    "we will only consider the particle lagrangians as they deliver positive energies .",
    "classically , there are no antiparticles after all . for the properties of the sme fermion coefficients we refer to table 1 in  @xcite .",
    "we start with the lagrangian for the @xmath15 coefficients that are of mass dimension 1 .",
    "it is based on the observer four - vector @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "the lagrange function can be extracted from eq .",
    "( 8) or eq .",

    "it is comprised of the standard square root term and an observer lorentz scalar involving both the four - velocity and the observer four - vector @xmath18 : @xmath19 the energy as a function of velocity reads @xmath20 where the latter result is exact in lorentz violation and valid at second order in the velocity .",

    "the lagrange function associated to the dimensionless observer four - tensor coefficients @xmath25 shall be considered next where we define @xmath26 .",
    "the exact result can be found in eq .",
    "( 10 ) of @xcite and it involves both the symmetric and the antisymmetric part of @xmath25 .",
    "however , the antisymmetric part contributes at second order in lorentz violation only . since in this article",
    "all considerations are restricted to first order in lorentz violation we start with the first - order expansion of the latter lagrange function , which is given by @xmath27 here only the symmetric part of @xmath25 contributes as expected . the particle energy as a function of the velocity then reads as follows : @xmath28 \\notag \\\\ & = m_{\\psi}(1-c^{(4)}_{00})+\\frac{1}{2}m_{\\psi}\\mathbf{v}^2(1+c^{(4)}_{00})+m_{\\psi}c^{(4)}_{ij}v^iv^j+\\dots\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the latter does not involve the mixed components @xmath29 with a timelike and a spacelike index .",

    "this is not surprising since the @xmath15 and @xmath40 coefficients are part of the same effective coefficient , cf .",
    "the first of eq .",
    "( 27 ) in @xcite .",
    "the three frameworks previously considered do not break degeneracy with respect to the particle spin , i.e. , there is only a single classical lagrangian corresponding to the particle solutions in quantum field theory . for the following cases this degeneracy",
    "is broken , starting with the @xmath41 coefficients of mass dimension 1 .",
    "the lagrangian is obtained from eq .",
    "( 12 ) in @xcite by setting the @xmath15 coefficients to zero : @xmath42 the two signs break the spin degeneracy as mentioned .",
    "the upper sign always corresponds to the configuration of `` spin - up '' and the lower to `` spin - down . ''",
    "although the concept of spin does not exist classically this correspondence can be inferred from the quantum theory .",
    "we will come back to this point later .",
    "note that the lorentz - violating contribution has a very different structure compared to the cases of the @xmath15 , @xmath40 , and @xmath43 coefficients ; it is called bipartite @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian was shown to be related to a finsler space that is neither riemannian nor of randers - type @xcite .",
    "one peculiarity is that it is not straightforward to expand with respect to the controlling coefficients or the velocity .",
    "therefore , we consider two observer frames : the first with @xmath44 being purely spacelike and the second with @xmath44 purely timelike .      the first case is based on a purely spacelike observer four - vector @xmath44 that is expressed as @xmath45 with the spatial part @xmath46 where the latter will occur in all results .",
    "for such a choice the lagrangian of reads as follows : @xmath47 the energy can then be obtained just as before by differentiating the lagrangian with respect to @xmath48 or by a legendre transformation",
    ". the result shall be expanded at first order in lorentz violation .",
    "this is a bit more involved compared to the previous cases since the lorentz - violating contribution behaves asymptotically like a square root function that does not have a taylor expansion for a vanishing argument .",
    "this can be remedied by introducing the angle @xmath49 between the velocity and the three - vector @xmath50 composed of the controlling coefficients .",
    "after doing so , the magnitude of @xmath50 can be extracted from the expression which allows for a subsequent expansion with respect to the velocity : @xmath51 we apply the same method to perform expansions of the momentum given as a function of the velocity : @xmath52 the latter is then solved for the velocity components to give @xmath53 at this point there is a subtle issue that occurs for the first time in the course of our studies . when solving for the velocity we encounter an absolute value of the trigonometric function in .",
    "eliminating these absolute - value bars would lead to four different sign choices dependent on both the angle @xmath49 and the upper or lower sign coming from the original lagrangian . in the end",
    "this would result in four different hamilton functions , which does not match the number of degrees of freedom in the original lagrangian .",
    "therefore , we have to set up a proposal telling us how to choose the signs appropriately to obtain two distinct hamilton functions corresponding to the two lagrangians given initially .    on the base of observer",
    "lorentz invariance , a coordinate system is defined such that its @xmath54 axis points along the preferred direction @xmath50 . the spin quantization axis can be chosen freely and for convenience it is arranged to point along the @xmath54 axis as well , cf .  .",
    "one the one hand , the spin - up state @xmath55 can then be understood to be realized in the upper half - plane .",

    "$ ] the absolute value bars act like a minus sign before the term affected .",
    "therefore , upon dropping them , the lower sign is picked .",
    "so each sign is not valid for all momentum configurations possible but just for a restricted range of angles . for the particle being in a spin - down state",

    "the spin vector @xmath61 is shown as well with the quantization axis chosen to be the @xmath54 axis . by doing so ,",
    "the spin - up state @xmath55 is situated in the upper half - plane and the spin - down state @xmath57 is realized in the lower half - plane .",

    "note that in general the velocity vector does not point along the direction of the momentum vector , cf .",
    "( [ eq : momentum - velocity - b3 ] ) , ( [ eq : velocity - momentum - b3 ] ) .",
    "hence , the angle between @xmath11 and @xmath50 deviates from the angle @xmath49 between @xmath7 and @xmath50 .",

    "when the particle is in a spin - down state , both signs have to be switched",
    ".      to study the second case of the @xmath63 coefficients an observer frame is chosen where @xmath41 is purely timelike .",
    "such a choice involves a single controlling coefficient : @xmath65 .",
    "the lagrangian is isotropic and takes a simple form : @xmath66 since the lorentz - violating contribution does not comprise @xmath48 the energy corresponds to the standard expression when expressed in terms of the velocity : @xmath67 however , this is not the case for the momentum since the latter is obtained as the first derivative of the lagrangian with respect to @xmath68 . in proper - time parameterization",
    "we obtain @xmath69 solving this relation for the velocity leads to @xmath70 note the singularities in @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the latter two expressions .",
    "furthermore , here it must be distinguished between the two signs : the upper sign has to be chosen for @xmath73 and the lower for @xmath74 .",
    "this procedure differs from the prescription that we introduced in the last section .",

    "<S> in this article we investigate whether a theory based on a classical lagrangian for the minimal standard - model extension ( sme ) can be quantized such that the result is equal to the corresponding low - energy hamilton operator obtained from the field - theory description . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is carried out for the whole collection of minimal lagrangians found in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the upshot is that first quantization can be performed consistently . </S>",
    "<S> the unexpected observation is made that at first order in lorentz violation and at second order in the velocity the lagrangians are related to the hamilton functions by a simple transformation . under mild assumptions </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that this holds universally . </S>",
    "<S> this result is used successfully to obtain classical lagrangians for two complicated sectors of the minimal sme that have not been considered in the literature so far . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it will not be an obstacle anymore to derive such lagrangians even for involved sets of coefficients  at least to the level of approximation stated above . </S>"
