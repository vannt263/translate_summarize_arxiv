    "this paper considers the effect of primordial gravitational waves on the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) .",
    "we consider spatially flat , perturbed friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) universes that begin with an early inflationary phase .",
    "as the universe rapidly expands , perturbations of the spatial geometry that are local in origin ( eg . thermal fluctuations ) are quickly redshifted both in amplitude and wavelength . after sufficient inflation",
    "these perturbations are no longer visible to an observer ; the only perturbations that remain visible within a hubble sphere are quantum - mechanical zero - point fluctuations .",
    "because these perturbations extend to arbitrarily high frequencies they can not be redshifted away . since the only significant perturbations remaining after inflation are zero - point fluctuations , we assume that the initial state of the universe was the vacuum state appropriate to de sitter space , containing only the quantum fluctuations and no additional excitations .",
    "as the universe continues to expand after inflation , these quantum fluctuations are redshifted to longer wavelengths and amplified ; one may think of this in terms of particle ( graviton ) production ( as we do ) , non - adiabatic amplification , or super - radiant scattering . in the present epoch",
    "the occupation numbers of the graviton modes are large .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "it has been shown that one may treat the collective effects of primordial gravitational waves as being due to the presence of a stochastic background of classical gravitational waves , and since gravitons are bosons , such an interpretation is only possible if the occupation numbers are large .",
    "sachs and wolfe @xcite showed how gravitational wave perturbations result in cbr temperature anisotropy .",
    "as photons from the cbr propagate , the paths they follow are perturbed by the metric perturbation @xmath6 , which in this discussion is due entirely to primordial gravitational waves .",
    "the energies of the photons are perturbed , which results in temperature fluctuations from point to point on the celestial sphere .",
    "these temperature fluctuations are usually characterized by the two - point angular correlation function @xmath3 defined on the celestial sphere . here",
    "@xmath7 is the angle between two points on the sphere .",
    "most often the two - point angular correlation function is expanded in terms of legendre polynomials , and the expansion coefficients or multipole moments are calculated . for a derivation of the angular correlation function for spatially flat cosmologies",
    "see the recent paper by allen and koranda @xcite .",
    "henceforth we will assume that the reader is familiar with this paper , which contains a detailed review of previous work on this problem , a comprehensive discussion of the physical motivation , and a detailed and self - contained `` first - principles '' calculation .",
    "early work on this subject @xcite assumed that the universe was completely dust dominated at last - scattering when the cbr decoupled , as did recent work by white @xcite which presented a concise derivation of the formula for the multipole moments due to tensor perturbations . also recently",
    ", grishchuk has adapted the terminology and techniques of quantum optics to the analysis @xcite .",
    "grishchuk stresses the importance of the phase correlations between the modes of the metric perturbations . a similar analysis by allen and koranda @xcite using standard `` quantum field theory in curved space '' techniques found equivalent results .",
    "we also showed that the now standard formula given by abbott and wise @xcite and starobinsky @xcite for the @xmath8th multipole moment is a long wavelength approximation to an exact formula . both the work by grishchuk , and by allen and koranda assumed that the universe was completely dust dominated at last - scattering .",
    "the first authors to consider the cbr anisotropy ( within the framework of the sachs - wolfe effect ) for a universe that was _ not _ completely dust dominated at last - scattering were turner , white , and lidsey @xcite .",
    "they used a `` transfer function '' to express the solutions of the wave equation for the gravitational wave amplitude in terms of the standard long wavelength formula given by abbott and wise .",
    "they found that the standard formula , which assumes that the universe is _ completely _ dust dominated at last - scattering , consistently underestimates the contribution of gravitational waves to the cbr anisotropy .",
    "more recent work by ng and speliotopoulos @xcite used numerical methods to integrate the wave equation and found similar results .",
    "neither of these studies used analytic expressions for the gravitational wave amplitude ( or equivalently , the graviton mode function ) .",
    "other work has been done which does not directly use the sachs - wolfe formula to calculate the anisotropy due to gravitational waves .",
    "crittenden et .",
    "@xcite numerically evolved the photon distribution function using first - order perturbation theory of the general relativistic boltzmann equation for radiative transfer , and included a thomson scattering source term .",
    "dodelson , knox and kolb @xcite have done a similar numerical analysis .",
    "both found that the standard formula of abbott and wise is only accurate for small @xmath8 multipole moments , and consistently underestimates the contribution of the gravitational waves to the cbr anisotropy for higher @xmath8 moments .    in this paper",
    "we give the first correct analytic expression for the graviton mode function in a cosmology that transforms smoothly from being radiation to dust dominated .",
    "( we correct a minor error in earlier work by sahni @xcite and nariai @xcite which claimed to find an analytic expression for the mode function . )",
    "we use this analytic expression and the sachs - wolfe formula to find an analytic expression for the multipole moments @xmath2 of the angular correlation function @xmath3 . the analytic expression for the multipole moments",
    "is written in terms of two integrals ; we use numerical methods to evaluate these integrals and report numerical values for the multipole moments .",
    "we compare our results with those mentioned above , and find good agreement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ angularcorrelationfunction ]",
    "we reproduce general expressions for the angular correlation function derived in @xcite , and explain how one uses these formulae to calculate the multipole moments for any spatially flat , inflationary cosmological model . in section [ cosmologicalmodel ]",
    "we introduce our cosmological model , which `` begins '' with an infinite de sitter phase followed by a mixed phase that contains both radiation and dust .",
    "early in the mixed phase the universe is radiation dominated ; later it transforms smoothly from being radiation dominated to dust dominated . in section [ gravitonmodefunction ]",
    "we solve the massless klein - gordon equation ( or wave equation ) for the graviton mode function . during the mixed phase the solutions to the wave equation",
    "are expressed in terms of spheroidal wave functions .",
    "the multipole moments are calculated in section [ multipolemoments ] using the graviton mode function determined in section [ gravitonmodefunction ] .",
    "an analytic expression for the moments is given in terms of two integrals , which are then evaluated numerically . in appendix [ appendixa ]",
    "we discuss the spheroidal wave functions .",
    "the differential equation of spheroidal wave functions is introduced and its solutions examined .",
    "we introduce a useful notation for the spheroidal wave functions , and give a practical method for evaluating them . finally in appendix",
    "[ appendixb ] we describe the numerical techniques used to evaluate the spheroidal wave functions and the two multipole moment integrals .    throughout this paper",
