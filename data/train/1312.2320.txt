    "semiconductor nanostructures ( nss ) exhibit increased oscillator strength due to electron hole wave function overlap , and band gap engineering due to the effect of quantum confinement ( qc ) .",
    "thus , materials like si are a viable option for opto - electronics , photonics , and quantum computing.@xcite qc is defined as the modification in the free particle dispersion relation as a function of a system s spatial dimension.@xcite if a free electron is confined within a potential barrier , a shift in the band gap energy is observed , which is inversely proportional to the system size squared , in the effective mass approximation . as a result ,",
    "the emitted photon energy is directly proportional to the gap energy ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "qc often manifests itself in optical experiments when the dimension of the system is systematically reduced and an increase in the absorbed / emitted photon energy is measured corresponding to electron transitional states .    for practical applications , utilizing qc effects in nss",
    "requires an understanding of the band structure of a low - dimensional material , how the method of preparation effects the final properties of the ns , and the kinetics/ dynamics of the absorption / emission process .",
    "the confinement potential is determined by the alignment of the respective fermi levels when a material of a @xmath1 is surrounded by a material of a @xmath2 , with @xmath3.@xcite the preparation technique can introduce stress in the system , which changes the band gap energy.@xcite for indirect gap materials phonon processes can effect the recombination mechanism.@xcite the lifetime associated with the recombination event can be altered by the excitation power.@xcite ( for a review of general properties of low - dimensional structures , see refs . .",
    "for a discussion of other higher order effects in nss , see ref . .",
    ") this article is concerned with the electron / hole recombination process in amorphous ( a ) versus crystalline ( c ) nss with different dimensions .",
    "several theoretical models ( e.g. see refs . ) have been applied to ns ; all models are empirical and no one model can model all semiconductor nss . since the parameters of a ns system are dependent upon the preparation method for a particular material , a comprehensive theoretical understanding must test along this dimension as well . in this article",
    ", we consider a relatively simple model of direct e - h recombination using a ` particle in a box ' type model as a perturbation to the effective mass theory .",
    "we use no adjustable parameters and include corrections to the model dependent on the preparation method as known experimentally and/or computationally when needed , thus achieving transparency in the physics involved .",
    "the only parameter tested in this work is the crystallinity , which is shown to effect the strength of confinement ( defined in sec .",
    "[ theory ] ) , because of the different symmetry properties of the electron and hole .",
    "the model is applied to experimental results on crystalline and amorphous si and ge nss , including quantum wells ( qws ) , wires ( q - wires ) and dots ( qds ) . systems of regular shape are chosen to ensure crystallinity is the primary parameter .",
    "for example , data obtained by van buuren et al .",
    "@xcite for high quality ` star - shaped ' samples are difficult to analyse theoretically .",
    "parameters relevant to a particular system are discussed and energy corrections are given when needed .",
    "results are discussed and a mechanism for the differences between the strength of confinement in the amorphous and crystalline system is proposed .",
    "central to the discussion of the confinement strength in nss is how the effective mass ( em ) changes as a function of dimension .",
    "recently , cosentino et al.@xcite demonstrated an increase in the confinement strength due to a reduced em .",
    "we developed a model for the em as a function of dimension and considered its effect in a qw .",
    "modifications to the em parameter include the use of a spatially dependent effective mass ( spdem ) introduced via the von roos hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this form of the em is appropriate for doped semiconductors , or when there exists a graded potential @xcite . at the interface of a ns where the crystal potential will change , possibly abruptly ,",
    "the em will change .",
    "the influence of the interface on the em is expressed through the bastard type boundary conditions ( b.cs ) @xcite .",
    "proper treatment of the em in a ns is an unresolved problem .",
    "the em is important for theoretical models @xcite , and related to the hopping parameter and carrier mobility in the tight - binding model @xcite .",
    "there is experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite evidence that the em should depend on ns dimension .",
    "fundamentally , since qc causes an increase in @xmath4-space @xcite , one does expect an increase in the bulk em ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "furthermore , a change in the @xmath6 will modify the bohr radius , therefore , altering the regime in which qc effects can be observed .",
    "the challenge is that experimental measurements of the @xmath6 in a ns are model dependent @xcite , and it is difficult to theoretically scale the em in a ns @xcite .",
    "however , the em provides a natural framework to incorporate the influence of a modified crystal potential due to the interface , which is not adequately accounted for in theoretical models @xcite .",
    "recently , costa filho et al . addressed the problem of a spdem by introducing a characteristic inverse length scale into the translation operator @xcite , given by : @xmath7 @xmath8 defines the inverse length scale and mixes the displacement , @xmath9 , of a carrier particle with the original position , @xmath10 .",
    "note that , this formalism is equivalent to the @xmath11-exponential formalism in tsallis nonextensive thermostatistics @xcite and results in a deformed or contracted space .",
    "tsallis thermostatistics describes a meta - equilibrium system , which provides a natural connection to confined carrier particles in an excited state . from eq .",
    "a modified momentum operator was derived : @xmath12 along with a definition for the spdem @xcite : @xmath13 furthermore , it was shown that a point canonical transformation ( pct ) of a hamiltonian defined with @xmath14 in the kinetic term and with a harmonic potential energy yields an effective hamiltonian for a particle with constant mass in a morse potential @xcite , in perfect analogy with ref . .",
    "therefore , eq . provides a natural framework to describe the anharmonic influence of the potential barrier on the carrier particles in a ns . in this report",
    ", we consider a spdem given by eq . and discuss the physical implications of this term on the confinement energy for a qw .",
    "note that the discussion , presented here generalizes to the case of a quantum dot and wire .",
    "the bohr radius of an electron ( e ) , hole ( h ) or exciton ( x ) is given by , in si units : @xmath15 @xmath16 is the effective mass of the e , h or x , respectively , @xmath17 is the electric charge and @xmath18 is the dielectric constant .",
    "depending on the e or h effective mass , the x - bohr radius is 4.5 nm for si and 24 nm for ge .",
    "the bohr radius defines the spatial dimension of the particles , which determines the range of sizes for which qc can be observed .",
    "we define three regimes of confinement here:@xcite    * weak confinement : when the dimension of the system is much larger than @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "in this situation , the appropriate mass in the kinetic term is @xmath21 .",
    "the energy term is dominated by the coulomb energy . * medium confinement : when the dimension of the system is much smaller than @xmath19 , but larger than @xmath20 , then only electrons will experience confinement .",
    "the relevant mass is simply @xmath22 for the kinetic term .",
    "most materials belong to this class . *",
    "strong confinement : when the dimension of the system is much smaller than @xmath19 and @xmath20 . here",
    "both electrons and holes experience confinement and the relevant mass is the reduced mass , @xmath23 , with @xmath24 . in this regime ,",
    "the coulomb term is small and can generally be treated as a perturbation .",
    "below we will use the terms ` weak , ' ` medium ' and ` strong ' to refer to the different regimes of confinement discussed above .",
    "in the ` particle - in - a - box ' model the bulk @xmath0 is taken as the ground state energy .",
    "the effect of reduced dimension is considered as a perturbation to the bulk @xmath0 within the em approximation .",
    "we consider an infinite confinement model and use the bulk em ( the details of the model are in refs . ) .",
    "the expression for the variation of @xmath0 is given by : @xmath25 @xmath26 is the band gap of the bulk material and @xmath27 represents the qd diameter , the qw thickness or the q - wire diameter in what follows .",
    "the calculation was carried out for confinement in 1d , 2d with cylindrical coordinates and 3d with spherical coordinates .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 is given for si and ge in the strong , medium and weak confinement regimes in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "the change in energy of the conduction band minimum ( @xmath29e@xmath30 ) due to qc is labelled as ` medium confinement ' in table [ tbl1 ] , because a @xmath29e@xmath30 is equivalent to qc of the electron only as defined by our model , where only the electron mass is considered in eq . .",
    "the change in energy of the valence band maximum ( @xmath29e@xmath31 ) due to qc is also listed in table [ tbl1 ] , which is calculated by considering confinement of the hole only , where only the hole mass is considered in eq . .",
    "the other fixed parameter is the appropriate @xmath32 of the bulk system .",
    ".parameter @xmath28 given in eq . for 3d , 2d , 1d confinement and for @xmath29e@xmath30 , @xmath29e@xmath31 .",

    "we have studied the effect of confinement dimensions and crystallinity on the magnitude of the band gap expansion ( as a function of decreasing size ) in si and ge nss ( quantum wells ( qws ) , wires ( q - wires ) and dots ( qds ) . medium and strong confinement models provide the best fit to experimental results ; moreover crystalline materials exhibit medium confinement , while amorphous materials exhibit strong confinement regardless of the confinement dimensions of the system .",
    "this difference in confinement strength was explained by considering the extent of spatial delocalization of the hole .",
    "a possible explanation is hole pinning due to coupling with the vibronic states.@xcite it has previously been reported@xcite that band tail states become strongly delocalized in the amorphous system compared to the crystalline system .",
    "this hole delocalization would partially account for the trends observed in our work",
    ". a lower value of the effective mass is reported for the amorphous system , which accounts for the trends observed in our work , while the hole mass increases and the electron mass decreases as a function of spatial confinement.@xcite we have studied the effect of a spdem with one singularity in a two band em model for qc by introducing a phenomenological model with an inverse characteristic length related to the gaussian width parameter .",
    "this model for the em accounts for electron coupling with the interface and allows for tunnelling effects to be included in the confinement energy . as the thickness of a qw",
    "is reduced , there is increased electron coupling with the interface , which increases the tunnelling probability .",
    "furthermore , we find these results to be a promising first step toward the development of better models of the effective mass parameter in low - dimensional theories .",
    "more work needs to be done to test the results of eq . within more sophisticated theories , such as , @xmath33 , tight - binding , or pseudo - potential methods"
