    "for more than four decades , since their introduction in 1965 by montroll and weiss @xcite , continuous time random walks ( ctrw s ) have been applied to virtually any field in which one wishes to provide a dynamical description on the microstructure of a given random system .",
    "a huge number of examples and applications can be found in the literature , of which we only cite a handful : transport in disordered media @xcite , random networks @xcite , self - organized criticality @xcite , electron tunneling @xcite , earthquake modeling @xcite , hydrology @xcite , time - series analysis @xcite and finance @xcite .",
    "the ctrw generalizes the ordinary random walk since in the latter the steps of the random walker are made at equal intervals of time , while in the ctrw the interval between steps is a continuous random variable . in this sense ctrw",
    "is related to several other extensions of random walks in continuous time , like semi - markov processes or markov renewal processes  @xcite , although the seeds of this idea can be traced back to the 1920 s with the pure birth poisson process  @xcite .",
    "a great number of developments of the ctrw are based on the assumption that the magnitude of the steps ( or jumps ) and the time intervals between them ( also called sojourns ) are a two - dimensional set of independent and identically distributed random variables . while in many cases this is a convenient assumption which allows for simple developments , there are some other cases in which independent walks are clearly insufficient to explain some aspects of the physical reality , and correlations between consecutive step sizes and/or waiting times must be considered .",
    "we have met with such a case in our study of financial time series regarding their extreme time statistics @xcite where jump magnitudes ( transaction - to - transaction returns ) show short - range memory , but it seems to be also relevant in earthquake modelling , where some evidences pointing to the presence of cross - correlations between simultaneous and sequential earthquake magnitudes and recurrence times have been reported  @xcite .",
    "successive recurrence times appear to be positively self - correlated as well but , oddly enough , consecutive magnitudes seems to be independent in this case .",
    "our goal in this paper is to address the theoretical setting of non - independent ctrw s , a class of random walks that can account for many physical situations . in this kind of walks jumps and sojourns are no longer independent random variables and their value at a given step may depend on previous steps .",
    "we develop the formalism for the markovian case in which the magnitudes of a given jump and time interval only depend on the preceding step .",
    "we also obtain a complete solution to the problem when the correlation between consecutive steps solely depend on the sign of the previous jump ( that is , whether the previous jumps is increasing or decreasing but not on its magnitude ) .",
    "particular examples corresponding to this solvable case allow us to visualize and quantify some interesting consequences of the existence of correlations between steps as , for instance , the transitions from unimodal to bimodal distributions .",
    "finally , we also develop the necessary perturbation techniques to deal with more general situations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] we outline the traditional ctrw based on the assumption of independence between events . in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] we present the general setting for non - independent ctrw s that are still amenable to analytical treatment . in sect .",
    "[ sec3b ] we present an exact solution to the problem .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is devoted to consider weak dependent models for which we develop a complete perturbation technique .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "although this work is essentially technical some even more technical aspects are in an appendix .",
    "suppose that a given random process @xmath0 evolves following a ctrw . in this picture",
    "any realization of @xmath0 consists of a series of step functions and @xmath0 changes at random times @xmath1 while it remains fixed in place between successive steps .",
    "the interval between these successive steps is a random variable @xmath2 which we call sojourn or waiting time . at the conclusion of the @xmath3th sojourn",
    "@xmath0 experiences a random change , or jump , given by @xmath4 in the usual model of the ctrw waiting times @xmath5 and random jumps",

    "some ctrw processes belonging to this category can be found in  @xcite for instance , and sometimes are also named as _ non - independent _ models  @xcite , since the label _ independent _ is then reserved for the particular case in which @xmath6 and @xmath5 are also _ mutually _ independent random variables , _",

    "we prefer to call eq .",

    "the chief objective of the ctrw formalism is to obtain the probability density function of @xmath0 .",
    "this pdf , called the propagator , is defined by @xmath19 where in what follows we shall assume that the initial jump occurred at @xmath20 .",
    "as is well known the propagator obeys the following renewal equation @xcite @xmath21 the function @xmath22 is the propagator prior the first jump and , since the trajectories of @xmath0 consist in series of step functions , we write @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the probability that no transaction has occurred before time @xmath25 @xmath26    we can solve eq .",

    "as we have explained , the ctrw outlined in the preceding section relies on the assumption that the pairs @xmath7 are independent two - dimensional random variables . however , as we have mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec1 ] there are many situations in which the assumption of independence may be doubtful  @xcite",
    ". we shall thus generalize the ctrw formalism in order to account for memory effects due to correlations between different sojourns and/or jump increments .    among the many ways of doing this extension we choose a simple , but yet general , method which consists in assuming that the joint density of @xmath35 consecutive changes , @xmath36 , fulfills the markov property : @xmath37 where @xmath38 this means that the pair @xmath7 depends on all the previous transitions only through the immediately preceding one @xmath39 .",

    "we should note at this point that even the independent ctrw is , in general , a non - markovian process .",
    "the only case in which the independent ctrw is markovian is when it is a fully - independent ctrw , and the set of random times @xmath51 is poissonian , that is , when the pausing time density @xmath34 obeys the exponential law @xcite : @xmath52 let us remark that the dependent ctrw outlined above is always non - markovian even for this poissonian density .",
