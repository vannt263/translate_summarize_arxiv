    "the last few years have seen an explosion in multi - wavelength surveys covering very large areas of sky and extending to wavelengths from the x - ray through the optical / infra - red and into the sub - millimetre , millimetre and radio .",
    "such surveys are not only allowing us to gain a more holistic view of galaxy and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) properties by sampling their entire spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , but their unprecedented area also opens up discovery space for rare and unusual classes of objects e.g. the most distant @xcite as well as the most luminous quasars @xcite .",
    "observational studies of distant quasars and galaxies have gained new impetus recently with the advent of sensitive infra - red detectors which are allowing us to observe the seds of galaxies and quasars after they have been redshifted beyond optical wavelengths .",
    "in addition to sources which appear red due to their high redshifts , there is also a population of red sources where the red colours can be attributed to : an intrinsically red continuum ; significant dust extinction associated with the quasar host galaxy ; the presence of broad absorption lines ; or a gravitationally lensed system where the foreground lensing galaxy and/or intervening absorption system redden the light @xcite .",
    "long wavelengths such as the far infra - red and sub - millimetre have for some time been used to track very red , dust enshrouded populations of galaxies @xcite that are otherwise obscured in the optical .",
    "now , the emergence of very large area surveys in the near and mid infra - red wavelengths such as the ukidss large area survey ( las ; @xcite ) , vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ; mcmahon et al . in preparation ) and wide infra - red survey explorer ( _ wise _ ; @xcite ) , are providing a different perspective on studies of red populations of galaxies and quasars . while these surveys are relatively shallow , the huge area of sky surveyed allows detection of rare , luminous sources .",
    "quasar selection in large surveys has typically relied on detecting their excess in flux relative to stars at short uv wavelengths @xcite .",
    "however , quasars also display an infra - red excess in the @xmath8-band @xcite which allows detection of a complementary sample of infra - red bright sources that are relatively faint at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "although numerous attempts have previously been made at studying the infra - red bright quasar population , the prevalence of galactic stars with very similar colours to red quasars in near infra - red ( nir ) surveys has meant that the selection of these objects has typically had to rely on optical - nir colour cuts @xcite or matching to radio surveys @xcite .",
    "a consequence of the heterogenous selection criteria used to isolate red quasars is that the exact fraction of obscured quasars , that are not detected in optical surveys , remains unclear .",
    "the estimates currently range from @xmath1420 per cent @xcite to 60 per cent @xcite .",
    "as dust - obscured quasars are expected to be bright at near infra - red wavelengths , a homogenous flux - limited sample selected in the nir allows one to estimate their true space density without requiring matches to other multi - wavelength surveys which inevitably introduce additional selection biases on the sample .    in hawthorn",
    "( 2012 , in prep ; hereafter paper i ) , we introduce a technique for isolating stellar extremely red objects ( eros ) from large area nir - surveys using a @xmath15 colour selection .",
    "it is shown that , provided the artifacts that dominate colour selected samples of extreme objects are well understood , selecting bright eros with stellar morphologies could prove effective in assembling a homogenous population of infra - red selected dusty type 1 agn .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of ten sources over @xmath10100deg@xmath5 in paper i has led to confirmation that seven are extremely red type 1 agn with similar h@xmath7 equivalent widths to samples selected in the optical .",
    "the red colours in these quasars imply dust extinction values of a@xmath162.3 .    in the current work ,",
    "we present new spectra from a search for stellar eros over a larger area using the same techniques as in paper i. taking the samples from both papers , we focus on the inferred properties of our infra - red bright type 1 agn and compare them to quasars selected at other wavelengths ; from the optical to the sub - millimetre .",
    "@xcite was the first to postulate that sub - millimetre luminous galaxies ( smgs ) and quasars are different observational manifestations of the same sources .",
    "major merger induced starbursts appear as sub - millimetre galaxies and as the dust clears from the decaying starburst , the central nuclear region is revealed as an optically bright quasar .",
    "red broad absorption - line ( bal ) quasars that are enshrouded by dust have also been studied e.g. by @xcite and hypothesized to correspond to a young phase in quasar evolution .",
    "a sample of nir - selected red quasars may therefore provide crucial observational evidence for the link between galaxies and supermassive black holes , representing a short - lived phase in the evolution of the galaxy where the dust has not yet fully cleared and is still obscuring the view of the quasar in the optical wavelengths .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat concordance cosmology with @xmath17=70 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 , @xmath19=0.3 and @xmath20=0.7 .",
    "all magnitudes quoted are in the native system of the survey being discussed - i.e. @xmath21 for sdss and vega for ukidss unless otherwise stated .",
    "the @xmath21-vega conversions for both the sdss and ukidss filters can be found in @xcite .",
    "red quasar candidates are selected from the ukidss las , one of the largest nir surveys and the nir counterpart to the sloan digital sky survey in the northern hemisphere . in paper",
    "i , we have presented details of our candidate selection algorithm including how to effectively screen the data for the many spurious sources .",
    "below , we provide a brief overview of some of the key features of our selection but the interested reader is referred to paper i for more information .",
    "red quasar candidates were selected from the ukidss - las data release 4 ( dr4 ) by isolating sources with stellar morphologies and j@xmath22k@xmath232.5 [ @xmath241.5 ] and @xmath016.5 [ @xmath2518.4 ] .",

    "in addition , four other bright sources with @xmath3216 that have @xmath3320.5 were followed - up in order to assess whether any luminous @xmath8-band sources that are also detected in sdss could potentially be reddened type 1 agn . finally , the fainter source ulasj2343 + 0017 was also targetted on account of being detected in the x - ray . therefore sample 2",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      taken at face - value , table [ tab : comp ] seems to suggest that the obscured fraction of broad - line quasars declines with intrinsic luminosity with these red quasars only making up a relatively small fraction of modest luminosity type 1 quasars at @xmath32 .",
    "at very high luminosities however , heavily reddened optically faint quasars dominate the population although with only small numbers at present to exhibit this trend .",
    "is this trend physical or can it simply be explained by selection effects ? while it is true that our survey is too bright to detect heavily reddened quasars with a@xmath42 at m@xmath43 ,",
    "should large populations of such sources exist , there are several reasons to suggest that this is probably not the case .",
    "flat - spectrum radio - source samples with very high quasar redshift completeness ( e.g. @xcite ) indicate that the quasar population as a whole can not consist of a very large fraction of obscured sources @xcite .",
    "although our sample size is still small , we have carefully taken into account the various selection effects in our survey and we probe down to @xmath8-band depths sufficient to detect most a@xmath44=2.5 quasars out to m@xmath45 at z@xmath102 .",
    "we conclude that highly reddened quasars are likely to only dominate the counts of type 1 quasars at the brightest absolute magnitudes , where nir surveys may be more complete than optical surveys .",
    "the above arguments while still tentative due to the small numbers of quasars in our sample seem plausible based on physical arguments .",
    "the duty cycle for the obscured phase is likely to be longer for the most luminous quasars , consistent with a longer time required to assemble more massive black holes .",
    "seen another way , the obscured phase is more likely to be associated with the most intrinsically luminous quasars with high mass accretion rates .",
    "these rapidly accreting , massive , obscured black - holes should preferentially lie at z@xmath102 corresponding to the main epoch of black - hole formation .",
    "indeed , our two reddest and most luminous quasars ulasj1234 + 0907 and ulasj1539 + 0557 lie at the high redshift end of our sample at @xmath32.5 .",
    "our selection criteria do not in any way discriminate against similarly luminous highly reddened quasars at 1.2@xmath461.75 but both the quasars observed at these lower redshifts have comparably modest luminosities .",
    "again , we caution against drawing strong conclusions from the very small numbers of sources in our sample but the fact that our most reddened and most luminous quasars are concentrated at the high redshift end of our sample , is also consistent with the most massive black holes assembling the bulk of their mass at early times via an obscured phase .    taken together , all these facts suggest that the obscured fraction may depend on quasar luminosity with a larger proportion of the most luminous quasars being preferentially observed in an obscured phase at z@xmath102 .",
    "our sample is still however highly incomplete for obscured quasars at m@xmath43 and a deeper @xmath8-band sample is clearly needed to fully test this theory .",
    "having demonstrated that our population of intrinsically luminous dust - reddened quasars at z@xmath102 with @xmath47 seem to represent a sizeable fraction of the total quasar population at very bright absolute magnitudes , we now make some explicit comparisons to previous studies of such objects using the shallower ( @xmath48 ) 2mass survey @xcite .",
    "our survey represents a significant increase in depth compared to this previous work and extends 1.52 mags fainter in the @xmath8-band . isolating only those quasars in the 2mass survey that overlap the redshift range of our sample ( 1.2@xmath461.75 or 2.0@xmath462.7 )",
    ", there are only 13 reddened broad - line quasars over 2716 deg@xmath5 in the @xcite sample .",
    "for each of these 13 qsos , we use the @xmath8-band magnitudes and dust extinctions given in @xcite along with the average ( @xmath49 ) colour of our quasar models ( @xmath50 [ sec : sed ] ) at that redshift , to calculate an absolute @xmath30-band magnitude .",
    "the counts are then scaled to our survey area of 955 deg@xmath5 and once again quoted in table [ tab : comp ] .",
    "table [ tab : comp ] demonstrates that our nir selection uncovers much larger numbers of quasars at z@xmath102 than @xcite but with similar intrinsic luminosities and much higher levels of dust - reddening .",
    "the z@xmath102 2mass sample has a median @xmath51 while our sample over the same redshift range has a median @xmath52 .",
    "we have also shown that the most heavily dust - reddened quasars in our sample lie at the highest redshifts whereas the reddest quasars in @xcite are preferentially at the low redshift end of their sample due to the shallow @xmath8-band limit .",
    "if red quasars in which the red colours are attributed to dust extinction , represent a young phase in quasar evolution , they should preferentially be seen at z@xmath102 corresponding to the peak of star formation and black - hole accretion .",
    "this is what is observed in our sample and suggests that other factors apart from dust extinction in the quasar host may be responsible for the red colours in the reddest quasars in the @xcite sample . selecting only quasars with @xmath530.5 from the @xcite sample in order to overlap the typical reddening in the quasars in our sample , we find a median redshift of 0.6 for these quasars . at these redshifts ,",
    "the host galaxy contribution to the quasar can be significant , affecting the quasar colours .",
    "in addition , at these lower redshifts , the near infra - red @xmath54 and @xmath8-bands are also tracing hot dust emission . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we demonstrate using _ wise _ photometry for our quasars that the temperature of this hot dust can significantly affect the colours of quasars at rest - frame wavelengths of 12@xmath38 m independent of the amount of dust extinction in the quasar host .",
    "the advantage of our sample over that of @xcite is that at the higher redshifts , the hot dust emission is redshifted out of the nir bands employed for the colour selection so the red colours can more safely be attributed to dust extinction in the quasar host .",
    "the current work is based on a sample selected using @xmath101000 deg@xmath5 of data from the ukidss - las .",
    "the latest data release of the ukidss - las spans @xmath103600 deg@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the ongoing vista hemisphere survey will provide an additional @xmath1010,000 deg@xmath5 of high - latitude sky therefore easily allowing our sample sizes to be increased by an order of magnitude over the next five years as well as probing fainter fluxes in the @xmath8-band .",
    "the combination of these near infra - red surveys with mid - infrared data from the all - sky _ wise _ survey will enable statistically significant samples of reddened type 1 agn to be assembled .",
    "we have already embarked on spectroscopic follow - up of these reddened agn candidates selected from the initial data in the new surveys using gemini - gnirs and this new data will allow us to tighten our constraints on the exact obscured fraction of agn at the main epoch of galaxy assembly and black - hole accretion as well as to probe in detail the dependence of this fraction on the quasar luminosity .",
    "we have extended our search for nir selected samples of reddened quasars to cover an area of almost 1000deg@xmath5 . within this area ,",
    "we have identified a total of 27 very bright @xmath8-band sources that also have unusually red colours .",
    "ten of these have been presented in hawthorn et al . in this paper",
    "we present spectroscopic observations of another 13 candidates .",
    "five of these are confirmed to be highly reddened type 1 agn increasing our total reddened nir bright agn sample to 12 .",
    "we combine the new sample and the sample from hawthorn et al . in order to examine the properties of the optically obscured luminous type 1 agn population .",
    "unlike previous studies , our sample relies on a homogenous selection at nir wavelengths without needing detections in the optical and/or the radio .",
    "we carefully account for the effect of h@xmath7 equivalent widths on the infra - red colours of our quasars and by probing luminous sources at @xmath551 , eliminate any contribution to their colours from the host galaxy . in particular , we reach the following conclusions :    * our sample of spectroscopically confirmed reddened quasars with redshifts all possess broad h@xmath7 emission indicating that they are canonical type 1 agn . * almost all h@xmath7 line profiles are best fit by a broad ( @xmath565000kms@xmath18 ) and intermediate ( @xmath561500kms@xmath18 ) component and some of the lines show significant velocity offsets between the two components indicating the presence of strong outflows in the broad - line region of the agn .",
    "such outflows are not commonly seen to affect the h@xmath7 lines in uv - luminous quasars and provide evidence that the reddened quasars are observed in a phase when they are in the process of expelling their gas and dust .",
    "* we use the broadband colours to fit model seds to all quasars with redshifts and find that significant dust extinction of a@xmath44=26 mags is required to fit the observational data making these quasars highly obscured at optical wavelengths .",
    "the dust extinctions in our sample are comparable to those seen in the submillimetre galaxy population at similar redshifts and this level of dust obscuration pushes the quasars well below the flux limits of large - area optical surveys like the sdss . *",
    "we use the line profiles to derive virial black - hole masses and eddington fractions for all our reddened quasars .",
    "the mean virial black - hole mass is 2@xmath1110@xmath57m@xmath58 and the mean eddington fraction is 0.5 .",
    "the reddened quasars are therefore already as massive as the most massive optically selected quasars but still accreting mass at a relatively high rate .",
    "we argue that they probably represent a short - lived phase in quasar evolution when the most massive starbursts are transitioning to uv - luminous quasars . *",
    "two of our confirmed reddened quasars , ulasj1539 + 0557 ( @xmath59 ) and ulasj1234 + 0907 ( @xmath60 ) are intrinsically brighter than any known sdss spectroscopic quasars and have mass accretion rates in excess of 100m@xmath58yr@xmath18 .",
    "they both lie at the high - redshift end of our sample consistent with a picture where the most heavily reddened luminous quasars are accreting the bulk of their mass at early times via an obscured phase .",
    "* we consider the possibility of lensing in our population and conclude that while we can not rule out the possibility that individual objects are lensed , our sample is generally fainter in the @xmath8-band than all the known lensed reddened quasars previously found .",
    "crucially , many of our sources are undetected in the sdss @xmath30 , @xmath6 and ukidss @xmath61 and @xmath54 bands where a lensing elliptical galaxy at @xmath31 should be visible .",
    "the bulk of our reddened quasar population is therefore unlikely to be lensed . *",
    "the broad lines combined with the large dust extinctions observed in our sample strongly point to a specific phase in the quasar life cycle , rather than orientation , being responsible for the red colours .",
    "we conclude that our quasars are likely to be observed in a phase of coeval galaxy and black - hole growth when the starburst is decaying but the dust has not yet fully cleared preventing these sources being selected as optical quasars .",
    "* we use our sample to place new constraints of the fraction of obscured quasars and find tentative evidence that this is a function of intrinsic luminosity and dust reddening .",
    "although a large population of modest luminosity heavily dust - obscured quasars is not ruled out by our data given the @xmath8-band flux limit of our sample , other independent lines of evidence point to this not being the case . at bright absolute magnitudes",
    "however , where we are reasonably complete , the obscured quasars seem to make up a sizeable proportion of the type 1 quasar population suggesting that nir surveys may be more complete than optical surveys at the very bright - end of the quasar luminosity function at @xmath62 . * the large obscured fractions in the most intrinsically luminous quasars are consistent with these sources having a longer obscured duty cycle . seen another way ,",
    "the obscured phase of a quasar is probably likely to be associated with its most intrinsically luminous stage as it corresponds to a time when the black - hole is accreting mass very quickly . *",
    "given these results and their possible implications for quasar evolution , a larger sample of @xmath8-band selected quasars pushing to fainter @xmath8-band magnitudes is clearly required to test the hypothesis put forward here that the obscured fraction of type 1 agn is a function of quasar luminosity .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented a nir - selected sample of reddened quasars that have been chosen to lie at 1.5@xmath463 corresponding to the peak of star formation and black - hole accretion in the universe . unlike previous studies",
    ", we detect populations of quasars that lie well below the sdss detection limits as well as radio - quiet quasars that are not present in the first radio survey , thus demonstrating the potential of new large - area infra - red surveys in studying the dust - obscured quasar population .",
    "we find that these luminous dusty quasars are likely being observed in a phase of coeval galaxy and black - hole growth and are in the process of expelling their gas and dust before turning into uv - luminous quasars .",
    "our ongoing follow - up of these sources at long wavelengths will allow their host galaxy properties to be constrained for the first time .",
    "having demonstrated the success of nir surveys in selecting reddened quasars , we have embarked on a spectroscopic campaign to follow - up new sources being discovered in the vista hemisphere survey and the wide infrared survey explorer .",
    "these new large area datasets will enable much larger samples of dust obscured quasars to be assembled over the coming years and push to fainter @xmath8-band limits thereby allowing accurate constraints to be placed on the physical properties and global space densities of heavily obscured broad - line quasars .",

    "<S> we present a new sample of purely near infra - red selected @xmath016.5 [ @xmath118.4 ] extremely red ( @xmath2 ) quasar candidates at @xmath32 from @xmath4900deg@xmath5 of data in the ukidss large area survey ( las ) . </S>",
    "<S> five of these are spectroscopically confirmed to be heavily reddened type 1 agn with broad emission lines bringing our total sample of reddened quasars from the ukidss - las to 12 at @xmath6=1.42.7 . at these redshifts , h@xmath7 ( 6563 ) is in the @xmath8-band . </S>",
    "<S> however , the mean h@xmath7 equivalent width of the reddened quasars is only ten per cent larger than that of the optically selected population and can not explain the extreme colours . instead </S>",
    "<S> , dust extinction of a@xmath926 mags is required to reproduce the continuum colours of our sources . </S>",
    "<S> this is comparable to the dust extinctions seen in submillimetre galaxies at similar redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the agn are likely being observed in a relatively short - lived _ breakout _ phase when they are expelling gas and dust following a massive starburst , subsequently turning into uv - luminous quasars . </S>",
    "<S> some of our quasars show direct evidence for strong outflows ( v@xmath108001000 km / s ) affecting the h@xmath7 line consistent with this scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that a larger fraction of reddened quasar hosts are likely to be submillimetre bright compared to the uv - luminous quasar population . </S>",
    "<S> we use our sample to place new constraints on the fraction of obscured type 1 agn likely to be missed in optical surveys . </S>",
    "<S> taken at face - value our findings suggest that the obscured fraction depends on quasar luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the space density of obscured quasars is @xmath105@xmath11 that inferred for uv - bright quasars from the sdss luminosity function at m@xmath12 but seems to drop at lower luminosities even accounting for various sources of incompleteness in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at m@xmath13 for example , this fraction is unlikely to be larger than @xmath1020 per cent although these fractions are highly uncertain at present due to the small size of our sample . a deeper @xmath8-band survey for highly obscured quasars </S>",
