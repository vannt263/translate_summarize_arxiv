    "the same trends are also found for the kinetic energy densities .    in conclusion we can state that , with a small number of included classical orbits and straight - forward uniform approximations , the semiclassical approximation for the spatial density oscillations in the circular billiard is excellent for closed - shell systems , good for mid - shell systems and still quite satisfactory for most intermediate systems .",
    "we have presented a complete classification of the closed periodic and non - periodic classical orbits in the two - dimensional circular billiard with radius @xmath20 .",
    "we have divided the orbits into two classes : radial orbits , librating in the radial directions , and non - radial orbits .",
    "analytical formulae are given for their actions , stability determinants , momentum mismatches and morse indices .",
    "we have found that many of the orbits can undergo bifurcations at which new orbits are created .",

    "periodic orbits can be created from non - periodic ones , and _",
    "vice versa _ , in isochronous pitchfork bifurcations .",
    "pairs of non - periodic orbits can also be generated from tangent bifurcations .",
    "finally , a class of non - periodic orbits is generated from the radial periodic orbit upon breaking its rotational u(1 ) symmetry by varying its starting point from @xmath9 to @xmath44 .    employing a recently developed closed - orbit theory @xcite ,",
    "we have investigated the semiclassical approximation of spatial density oscillations for @xmath1 non - interacting fermions bound in the circular billiard in terms of its closed orbits . at the critical points ( symmetry breaking at @xmath9 , bifurcation points , and the boundary @xmath11 ) , uniform approximations have to be used in order to regularize their semiclassical amplitudes . for the symmetry breaking and both two types of bifurcations , standard uniform approximations from perturbation and bifurcation theory could be implemented in a straightforward manner , having asserted that the bifurcations are exactly of the types known for periodic orbits as functions of other bifurcation parameters ( such as energy , deformation or external field strength ) . following the general analysis in @xcite , we have demonstrated that also in the present system the radial orbits are responsible for the short - ranged regular oscillations in both particle and kinetic - energy densities , while the non - radial orbits create their long - ranged irregular oscillations . we have also confirmed here that the radial orbit with one reflection at the nearest turning point creates the friedel oscillations near the boundary .",
    "we have finally tested the semiclassical approximation by comparing its results to exact quantum - mechanical densities .",
    "we investigated the convergence of the sum over closed orbits and the correlations of its results with the shell structure in the total energy .",
    "we find that , using a relatively small number of included classical orbits and easy analytical uniform approximations , the semiclassical approximation is excellent for closed - shell systems , good for mid - shell systems and still quite satisfactory for most intermediate systems .",
    "this is found to hold even for moderate particle numbers @xmath408 , in spite of the fact that _ a priori _ the semiclassical limit of a small planck constant @xmath38 corresponds to the limit of large particle numbers .",
    "the classification of closed orbits that we have given here is valid for spherical billiards in arbitrary dimensions @xmath409 , since the motion always takes place in a two - dimensional plane due to the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "the only difference from our present results for @xmath233 is the degeneracy of the orbits : all non - radial npos starting at @xmath44 have at least one continuous symmetry of rotation and are therefore no longer isolated ; also the degeneracies of the pos will change @xcite . while the shapes and actions of all orbits remain",
    "the same in all dimensions , their jacobians and morse indices become different for @xmath233 , and the regularisation schemes discussed in have to be modified .",
    "this work is actually in progress .    for smooth potentials with radial symmetry",
    ", we can expect all types of orbits found in the present system , except that the non - radial orbits will have smoothed reflections from the potential wall instead of corners .",
    "but there is reason to expect further orbits",
    ". there always exists a circular orbit ( not present in a billiard ) whose radius is given by the minimum of the effective potential including the centrifugal part .",
    "further orbits are rather likely to be created by bifurcations , although we must expect the bifurcation scenarios to be different from those found here .",
    "in @xcite it has , e.g. , been shown that in radial potentials of the form @xmath410 , bifurcations of the circular orbit give birth to the ( smoothed ) polygon - like pos under variation of @xmath90 .    for arbitrary potentials without symmetries , it is in general rather hard to predict the shapes and properties of the classical orbits . in @xcite",
    "we have discussed the applicability of our semiclassical closed - orbit theory to arbitrary potentials to some extent , and also given explicit results for the rectangular billiard in which all closed orbits are easily classified . for potentials with arbitrary shapes ( smooth or hard - reflecting ) , one will in general have to rely on the numerical search of closed orbits and their bifurcations .",
    "we acknowledge stimulating discussions with a g magner and m gutirrez .",
    "all the properties of the npos used in the semiclassical expressions  for the density oscillations have been given in the general analytical expressions in in terms of the angles @xmath90 and @xmath87 related by and shown in . in practice , however , we need them as functions of the radial variable @xmath0 . unfortunately , for the non - radial npos",
    "the inversion of the relation is not possible in general ; using the standard relations of the trigonometric functions this would require to find the roots of chebychev polynomials . in the following , we give explicit results as functions of @xmath0 for some simple orbits , for which the explicit inversion of is possible .",
