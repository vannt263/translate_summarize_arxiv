    "holography has given us a new paradigm to deal with strongly coupled systems @xcite .",
    "one of the many attractive features of this paradigm is that we can deal with phenomena at strong coupling in real time .",
    "though there has been substantial progress in using holography to study hydrodynamics @xcite and relaxation of strongly coupled systems @xcite , we still lack a systematic method for studying non - equilibrium green s functions in holography .",
    "the latter turn out to be extremely useful in many applications such as understanding thermalization and obtaining strongly coupled generalizations of quantum kinetic theories , to name a few .",
    "the importance of pursuing this direction can be readily illustrated by two examples .",
    "modeling the space - time evolution of matter formed by ultra - relativistic collisions of heavy ions at rhic and alice is a great theoretical challenge .",
    "it is equally challenging to develop reliable methods of inference for deducing this space - time evolution @xcite .",
    "ultimately , it is important to not only understand how the matter thermalizes incredibly fast in time @xmath1 @xmath2 fm at temperature about 175 mev ( at rhic ) and subsequently undergoes hydrodynamic expansion , but also how hadrons and resonances are produced and transported in this so - called fireball before finally getting frozen chemically and thermally .",
    "ultimately , we do infer the expansion of the fireball from the emitted hadrons . if the expansion of the rhic fireball is indeed governed by strongly coupled physics",
    ", then we can expect that holography will not only help us in modeling the space - time evolution of the fireball , but also help us improve upon existing techniques like hanbury - brown - twiss pion - interferometry used to deduce the expansion of the fireball .",
    "quantum kinetic theories are already being employed to understand the dynamics of the hadron gas after the chemical and thermal freeze - out in the hydrodynamically expanding fireball @xcite . however , in order to understand the details of how the hadron gas comes to existence in the first place and its subsequent freeze - out , as also correlations in the emissions of hadrons , one needs quantum kinetic theories constructed using non - equilibrium green s functions .",
    "therefore , to understand such questions at strong coupling using holography , we need to develop formalism to systematically obtain non - equilibrium green s functions .",
    "the second example pertains to holographic models of non - fermi liquids @xcite .",
    "holography has been successful in reproducing some of the features of arpes experiments in cuprates and other strongly correlated electron systems - the spectral function has a pole on a momentum shell at zero frequency and also shows non - trivial scaling for low energy excitations .",
    "these results may be interpreted as holographic reproduction of fermi surfaces different from that in landau s fermi liquid theory . in absence of a better way of dealing with strongly interacting fermions at finite density , holographic methods",
    "could provide us with useful qualitative insights .    nevertheless , to test such holographic models , we need to see if we can also reproduce qualitative aspects of non - equilibrium dynamics in strongly interacting fermionic systems .",
    "ultimately , when the electrons are weakly interacting , landau s fermi liquid theory gives a unified way of dealing with both equilibrium and non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that holography can do a similar job at strong coupling .",
    "once again , we need to understand how to obtain quantum kinetic theory from holography , and therefore a systematic method of obtaining non - equilibrium green s functions",
    ".    there are two important issues associated with obtaining non - equilibrium green s functions in field theory @xcite .    1 .",
    "there is no partition function which plays the role of generating functional of non - equilibrium green s functions . as we will review briefly later",
    ", these are obtained from a generalized effective action .",
    "the effective action technique guarantees the full hierarchy is consistently solved and ward identities are preserved .",
    "2 .   we can not use conventional perturbation theory to obtain the behavior in time , like for instance , dependence of observables on hydrodynamic and relaxation modes .",
    "this is because usual time - dependent perturbation theory gives us the behavior in time in the form of a taylor series , which fails to capture late time behavior like exponential decay .",
    "therefore , even at weak coupling non - equilibrium field theory is hard and typically we need to make educated guesses , depending on the understanding of a specific system .",
    "it will be remarkable if , on the strong coupling side , holography can provide us with a good perturbation theory for the non - equilibrium observables we will deal with here .",
    "the lack of a generating functional for non - equilibrium correlation functions on the field theory side , nevertheless , makes it hard to use the holographic dictionary to translate such observables to the field theory side .",
    "the observables of primary importance are two - point correlation functions . in the vacuum ,",
    "once the euclidean green s function is specified , we can analytically continue to obtain the feynman propagator , the retarded and advanced green s function etc . at equilibrium . at finite temperature too , it thus suffices to know the retarded green s function , from which we can obtain other propagators like the feynman propagator . at non - equilibrium",
    "the situation is different - we can not deduce from the retarded green s function , for instance , the feynman propagator which will have independent dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , all green s functions can be expressed in terms of two independent , real observables - the _ spectral function _ and the _ statistical function _ , which we briefly review now .",
    "the spectral component ( or spectral function ) of bosonic green s functions ( in @xmath3 spatial dimensions ) can be defined as the wigner transform ( i.e. the fourier transform in the relative coordinate @xmath4 and time difference @xmath5 ) of the commutator @xmath6 \\big{\\rangle } .\\ ] ] similarly in case of fermionic fields , we can define the spectral component as the wigner transform of the anti - commutator @xmath7 in both the equations above @xmath8 denotes expectation value in a non - equilibrium state .",
    "the fermionic spectral function is : @xmath9    the statistical function ( also known as the keldysh propagator ) is defined as the wigner transform of the anti - commutator of two bosonic fields @xmath10 or as the same of the commutator of two fermionic fields @xmath11 \\big{\\rangle } .\\ ] ]    all propagators can be expressed as appropriate linear combinations of the spectral and statistical functions . in this paper",
    ", we will be interested in the retarded correlation function in particular .",
    "it is actually more convenient to define the wigner transform of the retarded correlator . in case of bosonic fields ,",
    "this is defined as @xmath12 \\big{\\rangle } .\\ ] ] similarly for fermionic fields , the anti - commutator is used above .",
    "it is clear from the definitions of the spectral functions ( [ specb ] ) and ( [ specf ] ) respectively that the bosonic spectral function is related to the retarded correlator via @xmath13 , while for the fermionic spectral function , the relation is @xmath14 .",
    "the retarded correlation function does not contain any more information than the spectral function , since it is analytic in @xmath15 for a given @xmath16 for every @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    ". therefore , @xmath19 in both the bosonic and fermionic cases .",
    "on the other hand the feynman propagator @xmath20 is a linear combination of both the spectral and statistical components . for both bosonic and fermionic fields ,",
    "prior to wigner transform : @xmath21 since the feynman propagator involves the statistical function which is unrelated to the spectral function algebraically out of equilibrium , we can not deduce this propagator from the retarded function in non - equilibrium states .",
    "at equilibrium , both the spectral and statistical functions depend only on @xmath15 and @xmath16 , i.e. they are homogeneous in @xmath17 and @xmath18 , owing to translational invariance .",
    "furthermore , they are related by fluctuation - dissipation relations : @xmath22 for the bosonic case and @xmath23 for the fermionic case , with @xmath24 being the bose - einstein distribution and @xmath25 being the fermi - dirac distribution .    away from equilibrium ,",
    "the statistical and spectral functions follow a coupled set of equations which were first found by kadanoff and baym @xcite .",
    "these equations are not so easily tractable in field theory even at weak - coupling , however educated guesses lead us to standard kinetic equations like the boltzmann equation with quantum corrections .",
    "we will skip issues involving renormalization etc . and simply mention here that they can be dealt with efficiently at the level of the effective action .",
    "the spectral function , especially for fermions , is directly measurable by arpes like experiments .",
    "usually it is the equilibrium spectral functions that are measured experimentally , so that we need be concerned with their dependence on frequency and momentum only .",
    "recently however , there have been time - resolved arpes experiments in which non - equilibrium time - dependent spectral functions have been measured in approximately spatially homogeneous situations and their dependence on frequency , momentum as well as time have been obtained ( see , for example , time - resolved arpes across the metal - insulator transition in @xcite ) . conceptually ,",
    "when integrated over frequency at a given momentum and at a given point in space - time , the spectral function gives the space - time dependent density of states .",
    "the spectral function thus reveals the non - equilibrium structure of the effective phase - space of quasi - particles ( provided we do have well defined quasi - particles ) .    the statistical function , on the other hand , carries complementary information about how quasi - particles ( whenever they can be defined ) are distributed in phase - space and time and can be indirectly measured .",
    "for instance , in the case of a single species of fermions , the conserved current is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the conserved charge of the fermionic field , and the constant is independent of the state and required to provide an infinite subtraction which produces a finite result . in the so called quasi - particle approximation",
    ", we can assume that the statistical function is peaked only when @xmath15 is on - shell , so that it reduces to the standard phase - space distribution which follows the semi - classical boltzmann equation in certain limits .",
    "this completes our very brief review of the spectral and statistical functions respectively . in this paper",
    ", we would like to obtain the non - equilibrium retarded function holographically .",
    "our focus will be on the retarded function because we can compute it using linear response theory even in a non - equilibrium state .",
    "the holographic dictionary enables defining the source and expectation value of an operator in _ any arbitrary state_. therefore , we can avoid issues associated with the lack of a generating functional for non - equilibrium correlation functions .    to be specific",
    ", we would like to achieve the following :    1 .   to evaluate the retarded correlation function and the spectral function in non - equilibrium states , 2 .",
    "to find space - time dependent shifts in the energy and spins of quasi - particles in the non - equilibrium medium , and 3 .   to obtain the space - time dependent shifts in energy per particle and spin orientation at the holographic fermi surface .    with respect to the last point , we will reproduce a strongly coupled version of what is expected from landau s fermi liquid theory , as reviewed later .",
    "the second objective is justified on the grounds that it is known that in non - equilibrium states , the effective masses of quasi - particles become space - time dependent ( via an inhomogeneous temperature distribution for instance , or an inhomogeneous distribution of the velocity field as discussed later ) .",
    "we will succeed in all these objectives for scalar and fermionic operators .",
    "this paper thus finishes only half of the complete formalism required to obtain quantum kinetic theory from holography .",
    "we do not address the information contained in the statistical function and how to obtain it holographically .",
    "work in the latter direction will appear in @xcite .",
    "these issues will be complicated by the fact that we are dealing with composite operators in holography and we leave this for future study .",
    "we note here that there has been previous work where the equilibrium statistical function has been defined holographically in a consistent manner @xcite , based on the correspondence between the generating functional of field - theoretic correlation functions and a suitable partition function of quantum gravity .",
    "however , these can not be readily generalized to non - equilibrium states because of the lack of a generating functional for non - equilibrium correlation functions as observed before",
    ".    the key result in this paper will be the development of perturbation theory of scalar and fermionic fields in holographic duals of non - equilibrium backgrounds . at equilibrium ,",
    "the incoming boundary condition mimics causal response in field theory and suffices to define a well - defined linear response theory holographically @xcite .",
    "however , the incoming wave boundary condition does not suffice to give well defined linear response theory in non - equilibrium states .",
    "this can be briefly demonstrated as follows .",
    "suppose we have a non - equilibrium background in which a hydrodynamic mode with momentum @xmath28 has been excited .",
    "let the source of the operator at equilibrium be @xmath29 and the expectation value be @xmath30 which can be read - off from the profile of the field @xmath31 in the bulk .",
    "the non - equilibrium bulk contribution can be denoted as @xmath32 and this gives contribution to both the source @xmath33 and expectation value @xmath34 of the operator .",
    "the full retarded function can be obtained from : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a constant which depends on the action and has been set to unity here .",
    "however , the general solution for @xmath37 will have : + i ) two homogeneous solutions which are incoming and outgoing at the horizon respectively and , + ii ) a particular solution which will be completely determined by the hydrodynamic background perturbation and the equilibrium solution @xmath38 .",
    "+ this particular solution will contribute to both @xmath34 and @xmath33 , as will the homogeneous solutions .",
    "the incoming boundary condition will set the coefficient of the outgoing homogeneous solution to zero .",
    "the coefficient of the homogeneous incoming wave solution is left arbitrary . at equilibrium",
    ", this arbitrary coefficient cancels between the numerator and denominator , but at non - equilibrium we have an extra coefficient from @xmath37 and therefore ( [ rethol ] ) is ill - defined .    in this paper",
    ", we show that careful treatment of regularity of the solution at the horizon implies that the coefficient of the homogenous incoming solution should also be zero in presence of background quasinormal modes .",
    "this will allow us to put forth a well - defined prescription for obtaining the non - equilibrium retarded green s function and spectral function holographically .",
    "in fact , the prescription can be precisely stated in a manner which is independent of the non - equilibrium state .",
    "thus , holography gives a very well - defined perturbation expansion of non - equilibrium observables which can be understood in an universal manner .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a general review of holographic duals of non - equilibrium states .",
    "though most of this section is a review , the explicit metrics for charged hydrodynamics and homogeneous relaxation in section ii.d in @xmath39 are new as far as we are aware of the literature .",
    "the key point in the discussion in section ii.b however , to the best of our knowledge , is novel .",
    "here we argue that in a non - supersymmetric theory with a gravity dual , there may exist a window of temperature and chemical potential at large @xmath0 , in which a generic non - equilibrium state can be characterized by just a finitely few operators with low scaling dimensions even far away from the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "we also point out that there are surprising similarities with solutions of the boltzmann equation on the weak coupling side , which we review in section ii.a .    in section iii ,",
    "we develop the formalism for obtaining non - equilibrium retarded green s function and spectral function holographically in the approximation where the background fluctuation is linearized i.e. when the non - equilibrium state is studied in the linearized approximation .",
    "an interesting result is that we can read off the relaxation modes in the background by measuring the non - equilibrium spectral function .    in section iv",
    ", we compare our holographic approach with field theory .",
    "we also make a comparison with landau s fermi liquid theory regarding non - equilibrium dynamics of the fermi surface .",
    "furthermore , we obtain a holographic prescription to calculate space - time dependent non - equilibrium shifts in the energy and spin of the quasi - particles .    in section",
    "v , we show that our prescription for the holographic retarded green s function readily generalizes when we take non - linearities in the dynamics of the variables characterizing the non - equilibrium state into account .    finally , in section vi",
    ", we conclude by pointing out interesting issues that could be addressed numerically .",
    "an equilibrium state can always be characterized by a few macroscopic variables related by an equation of state .",
    "the distribution functions of particles , density of states , expectation values of operators , green s functions , etc . depend on these macroscopic variables .",
    "we also know , in principle , how to calculate the equation of state relating the macroscopic variables of equilibrium states .",
    "most importantly , we know in principle how to calculate the dependence of the observables in the underlying field theory on these variables characterizing equilibrium states .",
    "the most pressing problem in dealing with non - equilibrium states is that , typically even at the coarse - grained level , we need an infinite number of macroscopic variables to characterize them",
    ". these variables also depend on space and time . aside from taking recourse to a kinetic approximation , which is typically uncontrolled ( but intuitively well - motivated ) from the point of view of the exact field theory ,",
    "we usually do not know how to obtain the equations of motion of these macroscopic variables ( thereby generalizing the notion of equation of state applicable at equilibrium ) .",
    "it is also not clear how to relate observables in the field theory to the macroscopic coarse - grained non - equilibrium variables .    here",
    ", we will address these issues from the point of view of holography .",
    "firstly , we will identify a special sector of non - equilibrium states which can be described in terms of a finite number of operators of low scaling dimensions in kinetic theories .",
    "these states exist for any value of the coupling at least in the kinetic approximation",
    ". then we will argue holographically that these states also exist in the exact field theory and are generic at strong coupling and large @xmath0 after a microscopic time - scale , irrespective of the initial condition .",
    "we will further discuss how solutions in gravity describe such non - equilibrium states .",
    "let us first look at the kinetic approximation in some details .",
    "in particular let us analyze the boltzmann limit which is valid typically when , @xmath40 is small , where @xmath41 is the typical number density , @xmath42 is the mean free path and @xmath3 is the number of spatial dimensions .",
    "boltzmann equation describes the dynamics of particle - distributions in phase space .",
    "it can be reduced to local dynamics of the infinite number of moments of the phase - space distribution of particles @xmath43 of a given species @xmath44 .",
    "these moments are @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the @xmath47-momentum with @xmath48 being on - shell energy for each species @xmath44 .",
    "a conserved current ( for instance the baryon number current ) is given by : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the charge ( for instance baryon charge ) of the @xmath51th species .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath52 thus we see that the energy - momentum tensor and conserved currents are parametrized by a weighted sum of first few moments of the quasi - particle distribution functions .",
    "three comments are in order here :    1 .",
    "the boltzmann equation has no dependence on temperature or non - equilibrium parameters .",
    "the latter parametrize the solutions .",
    "the thermal bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distributions are exact solutions of the boltzmann equation . in absence of external fields ,",
    "boltzmann s h - theorem indicates all solutions finally equilibrate into thermal bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "2 .   the integrals involved in collision terms on the right hand side of the boltzmann equation ( see eq .",
    "( [ bolt ] ) for weakly interacting electrons ) have divergences coming from phase - space volume . to regulate these divergences one can put a ir - cutoff corrsponding to the thermal mass of the quarks and gluons with temperature being the final equilibrium temperature @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relations are also accordingly modified .",
    "3 .   in the dilute",
    "limit the effect of the interactions is taken into account via an effective thermal mass .",
    "thus the energy - momentum tensor takes a free particle form with an effective thermal mass .",
    "it can be shown that the higher velocity moments parametrize the flow of the flow , the flow of the flow of the flow , etc .",
    "of charge , energy and momentum .",
    "for example , if we define : @xmath53 then the heat - current is @xmath54 .",
    "the boltzmann equation can have solutions where the partial conserved currents are @xmath55 are all proportional to each other .",
    "this happens precisely when chemical equilibrium is achieved , and in fact any arbitrary solution achieves chemical equilibrium after sufficiently long time . in that case",
    ", we can define a four - velocity field @xmath56 and charge density @xmath57 such that : @xmath58 the energy - density @xmath59 is : @xmath60 the hydrodynamic variables are @xmath59 , @xmath57 and @xmath56 .",
    "we can define temperature @xmath61 and chemical potential @xmath62 fields in terms of @xmath59 and @xmath57 by using the equation of state of the full system at thermal and chemical equilibrium locally .",
    "there are special solutions of the full non - linear boltzmann equation , known as _",
    "normal solutions _ in the literature , which are purely hydrodynamic @xcite .",
    "these solutions are such that all the moments @xmath63 of the phase - space quasi - particle distributions of various species are algebraic functions of just the hydrodynamic variables @xmath64 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and their _ spatial _ derivatives in the local inertial frame co - moving with @xmath56 .",
    "the full phase - space distributions can thus be characterized uniquely by the hydrodynamic variables .",
    "furthermore , any arbitrary solution of the boltzmann equation can be approximated by an appropriate normal solution after a sufficiently long time .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations can be derived from the boltzmann equation ; these are the navier - stokes equation , charge diffusion equation and fourier s law of energy transport with systematic higher derivative corrections .",
    "the shear viscosity , charge diffusion constant , thermal conductivity and all the higher order transport coefficients can be obtained from the relevant boltzmann equation specified by the dominant collision processes .    these solutions can be further generalized to what were named _ conservative solutions _ @xcite . in such solutions , the various moments @xmath63 are algebraic functionals of @xmath57 , @xmath64 ( or equivalently the conserved current @xmath65 ) and the energy - momentum tensor @xmath66 , and their spatial derivatives in a local inertial frame co - moving with @xmath56 .",
    "thus the full solution can be specified by @xmath66 and @xmath65 .",
    "in such solutions the energy - momentum tensor is not necessarily hydrodynamic .",
    "furthermore , any solution of the boltzmann equation reduces to an appropriate _ conservative solution _ after sufficiently long time , and the latter reduces to an appropriate _ normal solution _ after the relaxational time scale .",
    "the first claim follows from the fact that the independent dynamical parts of higher moments of the quasi - particle distributions decay faster compared to the non - hydrodynamic relaxational mode of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath66 and the conserved current @xmath65 ( or equivalently the charge density @xmath57 and the velocity @xmath64 ) follow a closed system of equations in conservative solutions of the boltzmann equation .",
    "this gives a systematic generalization of phenomenology beyond hydrodynamics to include processes like relaxation .",
    "these phenomenological equations have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "obviously , the existence of normal and conservative solutions of the boltzmann equation can be seen at the linearized level and provides a method to obtain good approximations to the transport coefficients and relaxation parameters .",
    "thus , _ in the semi - classical kinetic limit captured by the boltzmann equation , an arbitrary non - equilibrium state can be approximated by a conservative state whose dynamics is given by the conserved current and the energy - momentum tensor even away from the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "_ this approximation is reliable after a microscopic time - scale which is shorter than the leading non - hydrodynamic relaxation mode , i.e. the time scale of local thermalization .",
    "the quasi - particle distribution is said to have locally thermalized when it can be characterized well by space - time dependent parameters of equilibrium distribution .",
    "afterwards , hydrodynamics takes over and the system equilibrates globally . in a generic solution of the boltzmann equation",
    ", we thus have three time scales .",
    "the first time - scale is the time for chemical equilibration @xmath67 after which inelastic collisions effectively cease , the second time scale is @xmath68 after which an approximation by an appropriate conservative solution becomes valid , and the third time scale is after which the hydrodynamic approximation is valid and is also the time scale of thermalization @xmath69 .",
    "the hierarchy is @xmath70 the conservative solutions of boltzmann equation describe the dynamics of both thermalization and hydrodynamics in an unified framework in the boltzmann limit .",
    "we note that there is no scale which parametrically separates the dynamics of the non - hydrodynamic part of the energy - momentum tensor and conserved currents from that of other relaxation modes .",
    "thus we may argue that even if conservative states exist beyond the boltzmann limit , they may not be typical non - equilibrium states after microscopic times as in the boltzmann equation .",
    "the typicality is just a special feature of the boltzmann limit .",
    "in fact , once we go away from the dilute limit necessary for the boltzmann equation to be reliable or consider genuine quantum dynamics ( not just quantum statistics ) , the typicality of conservative states will no longer be preserved .",
    "the conserved currents and energy - momentum tensor do not seem to capture generic dynamics beyond the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "conservative solutions may exist beyond the boltzmann approximation , but only in the purely hydrodynamic limit can they approximate a generic state .",
    "we will argue that if a theory has a holographic dual , then in certain phases in the large @xmath0 limit , the dynamics can indeed be captured by just the conserved current and energy - momentum tensor generically , after a microscopic time - scale which is much shorter than the time - scale for local thermalization . in such cases ,",
    "the conservative state can indeed capture generic non - equilibrium dynamics even far away from the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "holography maps a field theory to a quantum theory of gravity in one extra spatial dimension .",
    "it further states that in the large @xmath0 and strongly coupled limit , the dual theory of gravity reduces to a classical theory .",
    "therefore , in this limit states of the field theory are dual to solutions of the classical theory of gravity which are regular in an appropriate sense .",
    "furthermore , every operator is dual to a field and the expectation value of an operator in a state can be obtained from the asymptotic behavior of the dual field in the corresponding gravity solution .",
    "the question of which operators matter in characterizing states in the large @xmath0 and strong coupling limit can be seen from the masses of the dual fields .",
    "the mass of the field is related to the scaling dimension of the dual operator .    the large @xmath0 limit in the ( @xmath71 dimensional ) field theory side is the limit when the scale @xmath72",
    ", corresponding to asymptotic curvature radius of the ( @xmath73 dimensional ) space - time , is large compared to the effective planck scale @xmath74 ( in @xmath73 dimensions ) on the quantum gravity ( string theory ) side of the holographic correspondence .",
    "the strong coupling limit on the field - theory side is the limit when the length of the fundamental string @xmath75 is small compared to the asymptotic curvature radius @xmath72 on the quantum gravity side .",
    "the first condition @xmath76 allows us to consider the classical limit of gravity .",
    "the second condition @xmath77 allows us to ignore the massive stringy fields corresponding to higher excitations of the fundamental string .",
    "nevertheless , string theory is a theory in 10 dimensions .",
    "so , there has to be a compact space of @xmath78 dimensions on top of the @xmath73 dimensional non - compact coordinates .",
    "the condiitons @xmath77 and @xmath76 , i.e. strong coupling and large @xmath0 limit in the field theory side allows us to decouple the massive stringy modes whose masses scale like @xmath79 when @xmath75 and @xmath74 are small compared to @xmath72 .",
    "thus from the ten - dimensional viewpoint we are left with just the massless fields which include the graviton and gauge fields .",
    "however , the compactification over the compact @xmath78 dimensions still creates a tower of kaluza - klein fields which are dual to operators with possibly small scaling dimensions if the typical size of the compact dimensions is of the same order as the asymptotic curvature radius @xmath72 .    in a supersymmetric set - up @xcite ,",
    "the typical radius of the @xmath78 dimensional compact space is indeed of the same order as the @xmath73 dimensional asymptotic curvature radius @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , in the strong coupling and large @xmath0 field - theoretic limit , the kaluza - klein spectrum still plays a role in characterizing states .",
    "in fact , these kaluza - klein fields are dual to chiral primary operators and their descendants . therefore",
    ", a prediction of the holographic correspondence is that at large @xmath0 the scaling dimensions of the chiral primary operators do not deviate much from the weak coupling limit .    despite the presence of the kaluza - klein spectrum",
    ", it is known that almost all known supergravity theories in 10 dimensions admit consistent truncation at the classical level to gauged supergravity in @xmath73 dimensions when dimensionally reduced over the appropriate @xmath78 dimensional compact space .",
    "the @xmath73 dimensional graviton is dual to the energy - momentum operator on the field - theory side and the @xmath73 dimensional gauge fields are dual to the conserved currents with the global symmetry groups being gauged in the gravity side .",
    "one can also show that all solutions of @xmath73 dimensional gauged supergravities which thermalize to black branes with regular future horizons can be characterized uniquely by the expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor and conserved currents of the dual states .",
    "these solutions thus correspond to special non - equilibrium states - namely the strongly coupled version of the conservative states which can be characterized by the energy - momentum tensor and conserved currents alone .",
    "the parameters of phenomenological equations for the energy - momentum tensor and conserved currents which generalize hydrodynamics should now be obtained from gravity and not from kinetic theories valid at weak coupling @xcite .",
    "evidence that the solutions of pure gravity in particular , which have regular future horizons , can be interpreted as conservative states has been presented in @xcite for the special case of homogeneous relaxation .",
    "it has been proved that regularity at the horizon gives an equation of motion for the non - hydrodynamic energy - momentum tensor with precise coefficients for this case .",
    "furthermore , such conservative states should also exist holographically away from the strong coupling and large n limit , since the dual solutions in gravity can be constructed by perturbatively correcting the gauged supergravity solutions in @xmath80 and @xmath81 . nevertheless , in the known supersymmetric cases these solutions are always special and not typical even in the strong coupling and large @xmath0 limit , because the intrinsic dynamics of kaluza - klein modes are absent in these solutions .",
    "the situation can be expected to be very different in non - supersymmetric cases .",

    "we can also hope that the strange metallic phase of strongly correlated electron systems will satisfy these requirements in a window of temperatures and chemical potentials .",
    "we note that certain examples of non - supersymmetric holography have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",

    "we observe that the scaling dimensions depend on the scale through the coupling and hence also on the phase of the theory being considered which is parametrized by the temperature and chemical potential .",

    "if this expectation is true , the typical scale of the compact dimensions should be of the same order as @xmath75 and not @xmath72 .",

    "a finitely few decay modes on top of the hydrodynamic mode , we have an infinite tower of quasi - normal modes .",
    "the reason that we do not have an infinite tower of modes for the energy - momentum tensor perturbations in the boltzmann equation is that it has only one time derivative ( which in a lorentz - invariant language is the derivative along the local velocity field ) .",

    "equilibration in this context means that the event horizon will have uniform surface gravity ( the gravitational analogue of temperature ) everywhere and it happens only far in the future .    though the incoming boundary condition is insufficient for a well defined perturbation theory in non - equilibrium geometries as noted in the introduction , we expect regularity at the future horizon to be a sufficient condition .",

    "the incoming wave at the horizon will always behave like : @xmath317 as the geometrical optics approximation is always good at the horizon due to the blue - shifting .",
    "therefore , as long as the backreacted geometry still has a horizon , the integration over @xmath318 will produce a divergent factor : @xmath319 above we have used the result that the hydrodynamic dispersion relation up to the leading order remains the same in the presence of backreaction as @xmath320 is universally @xmath321 in einstein s gravity minimally coupled to any form of matter @xcite .",

    "the quasinormal modes always have a negative imaginary part in their dispersion relation , so the pole in the complex frequency plane of the background perturbation will always be in the lower half plane .",
    "the first point above makes sure that we can always write the non - equilibrium part of the solution as the incoming and outgoing homogeneous solutions plus a particular solution completely specified by the source at the horizon exactly as in the case of the hydrodynamic shear mode .",

    ". then we will show how our prescription reproduces the strongly coupled version of non - equilibrium dynamics at the fermi surface in landau s fermi - liquid theory , and the non - equilibrium modifications of quasi - particle dispersion relations expected in field theory .      in field theory",
    ", there is no partition function which can play the role of a generating functional of non - equilibrium correlation functions . the way we obtain these is to construct a generalized effective action @xmath378 whose arguments are not only the expectation value of the operator but also the two - point correlation functions of the operators .",
    "extremizing this leads us to obtain non - equilibrium correlation functions as functionals of the expectation values of the operators in equilibrium and non - equilibrium states .",
    "the crucial point is that the generalized effective action has no dependence on temperature or other equilibrium / non - equilibrium parameters .",
    "it is defined as a double legendre transform of a vacuum observable constructed over the schwinger / keldysh closed real time contour as briefly reviewed in appendix d. both equilibrium ( temperature and chemical potential dependent ) and non - equilibrium dynamics of expectation values of operators and their correlation functions can be derived by extremizing this generalized effective action . at equilibrium",
    ", we can take an alternative route by constructing a generating functional of thermal correlation functions as in vacuum , but in order to obtain non - equilibrium correlation functions the use of the generalized effective action is indispensable .",
    "we would like to mention here that the generalized effective action not only allows us to obtain the non - equilibrium two - point correlation functions , but it is also sufficient to obtain the three , four and higher point correlation functions @xcite .",
    "this is possible because through the effective action , we know the two point correlation function as a functional of expectation values of operators , i.e. we know them not in one but in a manifold of states .",
    "furthermore , the effective action technique readily ensures that we satisfy ward identities . in practice",
    ", we need to make an uncontrolled but educated approximation of the effective action which allows us to obtain non - equilibrium dynamics of expectation values of operators and their correlation functions .",
    "this has been successful for instance in the case of dilute cold non - relativistic bose gases in optical traps @xcite , and in constructing a quantum kinetic theory of hadrons for modeling their evolution after their chemical and thermal freeze - out in the rhic fireball @xcite .    the important point to note",
    "is that we can obtain the non - equilibrium correlation function by extremizing the effective action with respect to the correlation function first as below : @xmath379 thus we obtain the two point correlation functions as functionals of expectation values of the operators . here",
    "the time contour is the schwinger - keldysh closed real time contour , so this determines both the statistical function and the retarded propagator ( or the spectral function ) .",
    "further when we substitute the extremal forms of the two - point correlation functions in the generalized effective action , we obtain the ordinary effective action , i.e. @xmath380 extremizing this further we obtain non - equilibrium dynamics of expectation values of operators .",
    "it is certainly interesting to see if we can construct a generalized effective action to obtain non - equilibrium correlation functions in holography too .",
    "this will allow us to determine the statistical function also and not the retarded propagator alone as we have done here .",
    "work in this direction will appear in @xcite .",
    "however , we note two crucial points of our holographic prescription for obtaining the retarded correlator ( equivalently the spectral function ) .    1 .",
    "our prescription obtains the non - equilibrium retarded propagator as a functional of the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor and the charged current parametrized by @xmath61 , @xmath57 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath368 , @xmath370 , @xmath102 and @xmath143 .",
    "the non - equilibrium part of the correlation function is determined completely by the equilibrium part through universal rules at the horizon which do not depend on the non - equilibrium state concerned .",
    "the rule simply involves putting the homogeneous pieces of the non - equilibrium part of the solution of the bulk bosonic / fermionic field to zero at the horizon .",
    "putting these together , we can see a parallel with field theory .",
    "in both approaches , we do not need a specific rule for each non - equilibrium state , there is a universal rule which allows us to extract the non - equilibrium correlation functions from observables defined at equilibrium . in field theory",
    "the equilibrium temperature arises as the boundary condition appearing in the far future .",
    "the generalized effective action as mentioned before is just the double legendre transform of an equilibrium observable , therefore non - equilibrium dynamics can be obtained from equilibrium observables in field theory as well . furthermore , our holographic prescription has the same measure of universality as the generalized effective action to bring all non - equilibrium spectral functions under one fold at least in perturbation theory .",
    "the advantage of the holographic approach is that the late time behavior of the non - equilibrium spectral function is reproduced automatically without any need for resummation .",
    "thus we can do conventional perturbation theory .",
    "it might have been a bit surprising that the logic of regularity required that we put the extra boundary condition needed to determine the non - equilibrium part of the solution completely , at the horizon instead of at the boundary .",
    "it might seem that it would have been more natural to suppose that the source does not fluctuate from it s equilibrium value , so a dirichlet condition at the boundary would have been more justified .",
    "as we have already argued , this is not the case - the source gets screened or dressed by the collective excitations present in the non - equilibrium state also . from the holographic perspective , the horizon determines the screening / dressing of the source .",
    "we will here give another holographic interpretation of the non - equilibrium modification of the source .",
    "this will further vindicate that we need to put the extra universal boundary condition at the horizon and not at the boundary .",
    "that we have allowed the source to fluctuate from it s equilibrium value , is what will bring out the non - equilibrium oscillation of the energy per particle at the fermi surface and non - equilibrium shifts in the quasi - particle dispersion relations .",
    "a hallmark of landau fermi - liquid theory is that the collective modes as captured by the boltzmann equation leads to non - equilibrium dynamics at the fermi surface .",
    "this dynamics is characterized by _ shifts in energy per quasi - particle at the fermi surface _",
    "@xmath104 at a given direction @xmath381 and at a given point in space and time in response to a local fluctuation in occupation numbers of quasi - particles at the fermi surface @xmath382 .",
    "landau postulated the following phenomenological relation @xcite : @xmath383 where @xmath384 is the equilibrium energy of a quasi - particle at the fermi surface which is just @xmath385 with @xmath386 being the effective mass at the fermi surface dependent on temperature and chemical potential .",
    "the parameters @xmath387 are phenomenological inputs of the landau model which can be obtained from field - theoretic two - point density correlation functions .",
    "these phenomenological parameters determine all thermodynamic and many non - equilibrium properties of fermi liquids .    to obtain non - equilibrium properties one has to assume validity of boltzmann equation for @xmath382 .",
    "the equilibrium distribution @xmath388 is the fermi - dirac distribution at a fixed temperature and chemical potential and is a trivial solution of the boltzmann equation . using ( [ phen ] ) and",
    "the boltzmann equation , it can be shown that the fluctuations @xmath382 follows : @xmath389 in the linearized limit . above @xmath390",
    "captures the so - called quasi - particle collision kernel . studying this equation we can extract all collective excitations including the zero sound , hydrodynamic shear - mode and non - hydrodynamic relaxation modes . in order to obtain the zero sound velocity ,",
    "the collision kernel is not necessary but it is so in order to obtain the viscosity and relaxation modes . substituting a solution for @xmath382 in ( [ phen ] ) we can obtain the oscillation of the energy per particle at the fermi surface .",
    "the crucial point is that the oscillation is related to the fluctuation in the occupation number of the quasi - particles in ( [ phen ] ) .",
    "so , the oscillation in energy per particle at the fermi surface is in sync with the propagating collective excitation .",
    "we note that in non - equilibrium , we can not obtain the change in energy at the fermi - surface by looking at the spectral function alone .",
    "this is because the non - equilibrium change in the spectral function comes from both ( i ) the shift of the residue , and ( ii ) the shift in the pole itself .",
    "we need to identify which part of the non - equilibrium contribution comes from the shift in the residue and which part comes from the shift in the pole . moreover , the situation could be worse , as there can be non - equilibrium contributions which are simply analytic near the location of the equilibrium fermi surface and be neither the shift in the residue nor shift of the pole .    in the holographic set - up , the fermi surface(s ) is related to the existence of normalizable mode(s ) of the bulk fermion field at zero frequency on a fixed momentum shell @xcite . as the black brane retains rotational symmetry , the fermi surface is spherical ( circular for a @xmath249 dimensional system ) .",
    "we will be working in @xmath249 dimensional system ( i.e. in a @xmath251 dimensional bulk ) for the sake of concreteness .",
    "it will be worthwhile for us to first define the fermi surface holographically in a more general background which may not preserve rotational symmetry .",
    "this will help us to readily understand non - equilibrium dynamics at the fermi surface .",
    "a fermi surface picks up an internal direction in spin space .",
    "therefore , let us represent first an arbitrary normalized complex 2-vector which picks up a direction in spin space by two real angles @xmath391 and @xmath392 as below : @xmath393 the vector above may still be multiplied by an overall phase , but this will be unimportant for us .",
    "we then note that the hermitian matrix @xmath394 defined as @xmath395 is a matrix such that @xmath396 therefore @xmath394 is a projection operator , and it projects in the direction ( [ choice ] ) and in the orthogonal direction it has eigenvalue zero .",
    "the holographic definition of fermi surface at equilibrium is as follows .",
    "let us choose a direction @xmath381 in momentum space .",
    "then there exists @xmath391 , @xmath392 specifying a vector in _ spin space _ and @xmath397 for every @xmath381 such that : @xmath398 & = & 0 , \\nonumber\\\\ p(\\theta , \\phi)j\\big(\\omega = 0 , \\mathbf{k } = k_f \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}\\big ) & = & 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath394 is as defined in ( [ p])and @xmath222 is the source obtained from the bulk solution .",
    "the first equation above says that @xmath399 is diagonal in spin space in the following basis : @xmath400 which is the same basis in which @xmath394 is diagonal .",
    "thus this defines @xmath391 and @xmath392 .",
    "we note if we replace @xmath391 by @xmath401 , we merely exchange the eigenbasis . therefore",
    ", if @xmath391 is a solution , so is @xmath402 .",
    "the second equation is equivalent to : @xmath403 thus we have one linear complex equation to define @xmath397 .",
    "therefore @xmath397 is complex ( at finite temperature ) and associated with a specific direction in spin space . to get the fermi surface associated with the orthogonal direction in spin space which is also an eigenvector of @xmath394 and @xmath399",
    "we need to solve above with @xmath391 replaced by @xmath401 , i.e. @xmath404 as the @xmath39 reissner - nordstorm black brane background preserves rotational invariance , @xmath391 , @xmath392 and @xmath397 will be independent of @xmath405 .    more generally , the holographic fermi surface is @xmath406 which solves ( [ fdef ] ) and is associated with a specific direction in spin space in which the retarded propagator can be diagonalized . the general definition stated here should be useful in analyzing cases where we have spontaneous symmetry breaking in the boundary , particularly when these order parameters break rotational invariance @xcite .",
    "we note that at zero temperature @xmath397 is strictly real and corresponds to the pole at @xmath407 , but for non - zero temperatures the pole at @xmath407 is complex .",
    "the imaginary part of the pole is negative and represents smearing of the fermi surface at finite temperature , and vanishes as the temperature is reduced to zero .",
    "thus we can think of @xmath397 as a complex parameter whose imaginary part vanishes at zero temperature and has a small @xmath61 expansion .",
    "the real part of @xmath397 also has a small @xmath61 expansion and is the fermi surface .",
    "there is no dependence on @xmath15 as to find the fermi surface @xmath15 is set to zero . in the reissner - nordstorm black brane , the dependence of the negative imaginary part of this complex parameter @xmath397 on the temperature is given by a power law for small temperatures @xcite .",
    "this power is controlled by the near horizon @xmath408 geometry .",
    "it can also be shown that the retarded propagator and the spectral function also have a pole precisely when the source vanishes .",
    "therefore , the holographic definition of the fermi surface matches with the conventional definition which is that it is the location of pole of the spectral function in momentum space at vanishing frequency . in holographic systems",
    "we typically get a family of nested fermi surfaces .    as an aside",
    "let us mention that the pole structure of the holographic spectral function at equilibrium is different at small frequencies from that of a conventional fermi liquid and the scaling exponents are controlled by the near - horizon @xmath409 geometry @xcite .",
    "this means that holographic systems have generically non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "the full non - equilibrium source is : @xmath410 we recall that the full source @xmath222 can be determined from the boundary behavior of our prescribed solution for @xmath255 through ( [ bnb1 ] ) .",
    "in fact we can explicitly write in case of the hydrodynamic shear - mode up to first order in the hydrodynamic momentum @xmath28 : @xmath411 where @xmath233 and @xmath412 can be determined from the solution",
    ".    we will be interested in obtaining the energy oscillation @xmath413 at the fermi surface by calculating shift of the frequency pole for a fixed fermi momentum .",
    "we have to solve this perturbatively in the momentum of the collective background mode @xmath358 .",
    "perturbatively , the energy shift on the fermi surface @xmath414 in the direction @xmath381 at a given point in space - time is thus obtained by solving : @xmath415 where @xmath416 and @xmath417 label the spin orientation of the equilibrium fermi surface as discussed before and @xmath394 is as defined in ( [ p ] ) .",
    "the above amounts to two complex equations and we have four unknowns , namely real @xmath418 and @xmath419 giving change in the orientation in spin space and complex @xmath420 . as we have mentioned earlier , the change in orientation in spin space can not be directly read off from the change in retarded correlator due to the ambiguity in identifying which change is due to shift in the pole and which change is due to shift in the residue . we can obtain the non - equilibrium shift in spin space at the fermi surface from the non - equilibrium source directly .",
    "the shift in the energy of the equilibrium fermi surface with orthogonal spin orientation can be obtained by solving the above equation with @xmath416 replaced by @xmath421 .    clearly in the hydrodynamic",
    "shear wave background , @xmath414 takes the form : @xmath422    therefore , we find that the holographic fermi surface indeed oscillates in space and time in sync with the background collective excitation . nevertheless in order to obtain the analogue of",
    "( [ phen ] ) in holography linking the spectral shift at the fermi surface to the statistical shift ( i.e. shift in occupation number ) we need to obtain the statistical function holographically also .",
    "we leave this for the future .      not only the energy per particle at the fermi surface but other normalizable modes with non - zero frequencies also receive space - time dependent shifts in energy at a given momentum in sync with the background collective excitation .",
    "this can be interpreted as the space - time dependent shifts of the dispersion relations of the quasi - particles in the non - equilibrium medium .",
    "this is certainly expected as quasi - particles receive a thermal mass and if the temperature oscillates for instance , the dispersion relations indeed become space - time dependent .",
    "this is usually a hard calculation in non - equilibrium quantum field theory , but we can readily generalize the holographic strategy discussed above to obtain non - equilibrium shifts in quasi - particle dispersion relations .    a particular quasi - particle branch can be identified via the following steps at equilibrium .    1 .",
    "consider the equilibrium green s function @xmath423 .",
    "this can be diagonalized at a given @xmath15 and @xmath16 and the eigenvectors can be labelled as in ( [ basis ] ) by @xmath424 and @xmath425 . furthermore",
    ", if @xmath416 is a solution , so is the @xmath426 as this merely exchanges the eigenbasis .",
    "the quasiparticle pole @xmath427 can be identified with a definite orientation in spin space by solving : @xmath428 the above amounts to one complex equation which determines @xmath427 with @xmath416 and @xmath417 determined in the previous step .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath427 is negative . to obtain the quasi - particle branch with opposite spin orientation , we need to solve the above with @xmath416 replaced by @xmath429 .    once again , if there is rotational symmetry in the background , i.e. if there are no order paramaters of spontaneous symmetry breaking which breaks rotational invariance , @xmath416 , @xmath417 and @xmath427 can depend only on the modulus of @xmath16 .",
    "the space - time dependent shift in dispersion relation is characterized by : @xmath430 the shift @xmath420 can be obtained by solving : @xmath431 the above equation amounts to two complex equations which allows us to solve the real unknowns @xmath418 and @xmath419 giving shifts in spin space and the complex unknown @xmath420 . to obtain the non - equilibrium shift in the dispersion relation for the other equilibrium branch with orthogonal spin orientation ,",
    "we need to solve the above with @xmath416 replaced by @xmath429 .",
    "the solution of @xmath420 will take the form in a hydrodynamic shear - wave background , for instance , clearly takes the form : @xmath432    therefore , we see that the shift in the dispersion relation of the quasi - particle pole is also in sync with the propagating collective mode . furthermore , though we have discussed the fermionic case explicitly here , clearly the same strategy can be applied to the bosonic field also . in fact , the source being a complex number instead of a complex 2-vector in the bosonic case , the equations will be much simpler .",
    "the shift @xmath420 in the quasi - particle pole is generically complex .",
    "interestingly the sign of the imaginary part of @xmath420 can be both positive and negative .",
    "thus we can get both non - equilibrium suppression or enhancement of quasi - particle decays as indeed observed in the rhic fireball for various resonances ( short - lived quasi - particles ) @xcite .",
    "it is known that solutions of gravity which have regular future horizons reproduce non - linear phenomenological equations for irreversible processes in the dual field theory .",
    "the best studied examples are related to fluid / gravity correspondence .",
    "the full non - linear navier - stokes equation with higher derivative corrections can be reproduced from gravity and this success has also been extended to the case of charged hydrodynamics @xcite . as we have discussed before ,",
    "gravity is expected to reproduce the general phenomenological equations which describe the full evolution of energy - momentum tensor and conserved currents which generalize hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "this has been shown explicitly for the case of spatially homogeneous relaxation @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the regularity of the future horizon determines the phenomenological coefficients .",
    "we would like to show that the prescriptions described so far can be readily generalized to include non - linearities in the dynamics of the energy - momentum tensor and conserved currents characterizing the non - equilibrium states .",
    "we can systematically include these non - linearities into the retarded correlator , the shifts in the dispersion relations of quasi - particles , etc .",
    "the key is to see how the solutions for the bosonic and fermionic fields get determined in the perturbed background .",
    "let us focus on the case of the hydrodynamic background .",
    "if we take into account non - linearities in @xmath433 in the background , clearly these non - linearities will also appear in the laplacian of the bosonic field .",
    "let us consider quadratic dependence on two distinct velocity perturbations @xmath162 and @xmath434 for instance , at a given order in the derivative expansion @xmath88",
    "( i.e. at the @xmath88th order in the hydrodynamic momentum ) .",
    "the solution for @xmath196 will receive a correction quadratic in the amplitude of velocity perturbation and at @xmath88th order in the derivative expansion which can be represented as : @xmath435 the radial dependence above can be determined the equation of motion : @xmath436 where @xmath437 is the laplacian for a scalar with @xmath84-momentum @xmath262 in the unperturbed @xmath39 reissner - nordstorm background and @xmath438 is a generic source term .",
    "for @xmath439 the source @xmath440 can contain terms like @xmath441 , etc .",
    "it also contains the solutions at the lower order in the perturbation expansion for instance @xmath442 .",
    "clearly the general solution of @xmath196 near the horizon can again be separated into two homogeneous pieces , the incoming and the outgoing modes , and a particular piece which has no arbitrary integration constant and is completely determined by the source term @xmath438 . in order to satisfy the incoming boundary condition , we should put the coefficient of the outgoing mode to zero .",
    "also as discussed before , the integration over the hydrodynamic frequencies @xmath185 and @xmath443 will produce a divergence at the horizon for the incoming mode , as for instance in the case above with dependence on two hydrodynamic shear wave background modes like : @xmath444 obviously the coefficient of the incoming mode has to depend on @xmath211 and the hydrodynamic momenta required by the order in the perturbation expansion . the contribution from the frequency pole in @xmath445 given by the hydrodynamic shear dispersion relation produces the above divergent behavior",
    ". in general the divergence will always be there for any quasinormal wave background as it s dispersion relation @xmath446 will have a negative imaginary part .",
    "therefore , we should put the coefficients of the incoming mode at the horizon to zero too .",
    "we are just left with the particular piece which is completely determined by the source term containing the solutions at the lower orders in the perturbation expansion .",
    "therefore , applying induction , _ at each order in the perturbation expansion , the non - equilibrium solution is uniquely determined by the equilibrium solution , i.e. the solution at the zeroth order in the unperturbed black brane background_. the consistency of holographic duality requires the solution at each order in the perturbation to be regular at the horizon .",
    "as the solution is uniquely fixed at each order in the perturbation expansion , we can obtain the non - equilibrium contributions to the source and the expectation value of the dual operator by studying the asymptotic behavior of the solution at each order .",
    "this procedure can also be applied for fermionic fields .    once the source is obtained at a given order in the perturbation expansion , it is straightforward to obtain the shift in the dispersion relation of quasi - particles . for example , @xmath447 along with the non - equilibrium shift in the spin orientation given by @xmath448 and @xmath449",
    "can be obtained from @xmath450 by solving : @xmath451    a consistent perturbation theory for the solution in the non - equilibrium background thus suffices to take into account non - linearities in @xmath367 , @xmath109 , @xmath369 etc . in the retarded correlation function , spectral function , non - equilibrium shift in the dispersion relations , etc .",
    "this paper has been devoted to developing a general holographic formalism for determining non - equilibrium retarded correlator , spectral function , shifts in dispersion relations , etc . needless to say",
    ", we would like to use this formalism to numerically calculate these space - time dependent quantities in the specific set up of charged bosonic and fermionic fields minimally coupled to einstein - maxwell gravity in @xmath39 discussed here .",
    "in particular , the following questions require attention .    1 .",
    "it is known that at equilibrium the temperature modifies the spectral function only in the infrared , while in the ultraviolet the spectral function remains as in the vacuum .",
    "it can be expected that we have a similar feature even in non - equilibrium - the ultraviolet behavior of the spectral function , quasi - particle dispersion relations should be independent of the state",
    ". it will be interesting to see if this is reproduced in our case .",
    "some of the background quasi - normal modes indeed can have very high frequencies , while high frequency dependent corrections can also be generated by non - linearities .",
    "therefore , numerical studies can help us understand how the effect of high frequency dependent background modes gets suppressed in the ultraviolet , if this is indeed the case .",
    "2 .   the non - equilibrium shifts in the dispersion relations can have both positive and negative imaginary parts .",
    "if positive it leads to suppression and if negative it leads to enhancement of the decay .",
    "it will be interesting to see if one can use non - linearities to design a background in which a specific quasi - particle can be stabilized against decay to a large extent in a certain range of energies .",
    "this can allow us to observe otherwise short - lived quasi - particles . in particular , it will be interesting to see if some bound states of heavy quarks can indeed exist in the quark - gluon plasma at temperature 175 mev .",
    "3 .   the quasi - particle dispersion relations can change non - analytically with the temperature particularly if there is level crossing .",
    "it will be interesting to design a non - equilibrium background where the temperature varies in space and time over the range in which this non - analyticity can occur and study exactly how the quasi - particles behave in such backgrounds .",
    "it will be interesting to learn from such holographic examples how to describe such non - equilibrium states in field theory .",
    "work is in progress by the authors of this paper to tackle such issues numerically @xcite .",
    "our prescription here gives an algorithm to tackle such questions in specific holographic models .",
    "another direction we want to pursue in the future is to study non - equilibrium spectral functions in states corresponding to a plasma undergoing boost - invariant hydrodynamic expansion as in the rhic fireball .",
    "this will give us insights into how hadrons are produced and transported in the medium , and finally get frozen chemically and thermally .",

    "we will review the formalism for bosonic operators here .",
    "the generalization to fermionic operators is straightforward .",
    "the starting point of the construction of the generalized effective action is to generalize the partition function which is a generating functional of the vaccum correlation functions . here on top of a source @xmath487 for a single operator @xmath488 , we add a non - local source @xmath489 for a pair of operators @xmath488 and @xmath490 , and define :        we then define the expectation value of the operator @xmath492 and the green s function @xmath493 through : @xmath494 eliminating @xmath495 and @xmath496 in favor of @xmath497 and @xmath498 , we can now do a legendre transform to define the generalized effective action :        such an effective action is usually considered for the elementary fields and their green s functions in the literature . however , as discussed above we can construct the same for the set of gauge - invariant single trace operators in a non - abelian gauge theory .    there is one important point in the above construction .",
    "the effective action is constructed over the so - called schwinger - keldysh real time contour ( fig . [ keldyshcontour ] ) , which travels from @xmath187 to @xmath188 infinitesimially above the real line and then back from @xmath188 to @xmath187 infinitesimially below the real line .",
    "it is necessary to consider this `` closed - time '' contour because the usual time - ordered green s function or the feynmann propagator do not contain the full information about the operator in presence of sources in a non - equilibrium state as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the closed - time contour ensures we propagate the full information of the operator in presence of the sources .",
    "in fact , the full closed - time contour ordered green s function can be written as a combination of the commutator and the anti - commutator .",
    "for instance , if both operators are bosonic the @xmath502\\rangle \\ , \\text{sign}_{c}(x^{0}-y^{0}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] above @xmath36 denotes the closed - time contour , and @xmath503 and @xmath504 are the time coordinates of the d - dimensional position vector @xmath275 and @xmath276 respectively .",
    "in fact , as discussed in the introduction , the spectral function @xmath505 is related to the commutator and the statistical function ( or keldysh propagator ) @xmath506 is related to the anti - commutator in the following way ( for bosonic fields ) : @xmath507\\rangle , \\nonumber\\\\ g_{\\mathcal{k}ll'}(x , y ) & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\langle\\{\\mathcal{o}_l(x ) , \\mathcal{o}_{l'}(y)\\}\\rangle .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coupled equation of motion of the spectral and statistical functions are obtained from the generalized effective action .    _",
    "the generalized effective action has no dependence on temperature or non - equilibrium variables , it is defined as a legendre transform of the vacuum persistence amplitude in the presence of single and double operator sources .",
    "however , thermal and non - equilibrium propagators also can be obtained as solutions which extremize this generalized effective action . _ in order to obtain thermal propagators , we need to impose translational invariance , so the wigner transformed spectral and statistical functions @xmath508 and @xmath509 do not depend on the centre - of - mass coordinates @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , they should be related by a temperature dependent fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
