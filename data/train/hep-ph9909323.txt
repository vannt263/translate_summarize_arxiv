    "the differential cross - section for electron - positron pair production by linearly polarized photons was derived in a series of papers during the period 19701972 @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "expressed as a function of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the electron mass ( which we shall set equal to unity ) and @xmath0 is the photon energy in the laboratory reference frame , the differential cross - section with respect to the azimuthal angle , @xmath4 , between the photon polarization vector @xmath5 and the plane containing the initial - photon and recoil - electron momenta , is given by @xmath6,\\ ] ] with @xmath7 here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the stokes parameters describing the photon polarization , introduced through its spin - density matrix : @xmath10    in the derivation of ( [ eq1 ] ) terms of order @xmath11 were systematically neglected .",
    "the main contribution , @xmath12 , arises from configurations with small recoil momentum , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the polar angle of the recoil electron ( i.e. , the angle between the initial photon and recoil - electron directions ) .",
    "however , the corresponding events presumably can not be measured experimentally . for the region @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , the doubly differential cross - section was obtained in @xcite : @xmath17,\\ ] ] with @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the comparatively large magnitude of the azimuthal asymmetry @xmath20 is , in fact , the reason this process is used for the polarimetry of linearly polarized photons @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to calculate the power corrections of order @xmath21 to the asymptotic expression for the asymmetry .",
    "the calculation of radiative corrections to the asymptotic expression for the asymmetry is a rather difficult problem , which we shall not touch here .",
    "a rough estimate gives @xmath22 .",
    "the differential cross - section of electron - positron pair photoproduction off a free electron in the born approximation is described by eight feynman diagrams .",
    "it was calculated numerically in particular by k.  mork @xcite .",
    "the closed expression for the unpolarized case is very cumbersome and was first obtained in a complete form by e.  haug during the period 19751985 @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the exact analytical expression for the differential cross - section in the case of a polarized photon has not yet been published .",
    "special attention has been paid to the so - called bethe - heitler ( bh ) subset of feynman diagrams , whose contribution does not vanish in the high - energy limit , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the power corrections to this contribution to the total cross - section , behaving as @xmath24 @xcite , indicate the need for the exact expression .",
    "a detailed analysis of the expressions of haug s work reveals that the interference terms of the bh matrix elements with the other three gauge - invariant subsets ( which take into account the bremsstrahlung mechanism of pair creation and fermi statistics for fermions ) turn out to be of the order of some percent for @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference between the asymptotic and the exact expression is still found to be of the order of several percent for @xmath26 , i.e. , very far above threshold , rendering the asymptotic expression useless in the energy range of interest .",
    "arguments of positivity of the cross - section provide the relevant upper bound for the polarized part of the differential cross - section .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a monte carlo simulation of the process under consideration was performed using the helas code , in which all eight lowest order diagrams can be numerically treated without approximation .",
    "there it was shown that one might consider only the two leading graphs in a wide range of photon energies from 50 to 550  mev .",
    "note that this observation was made earlier for the unpolarized case by haug @xcite ( who presented his results in explicit analytical form ) .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . after introducing the problem , in section  [ sec : kinematics ]",
    "we analyze the kinematics of the process and give a general expression for the differential cross - section taking into account only leading and non - leading ( @xmath27 ) contributions . section  [ sec : cross ] is devoted to the derivation of the differential cross - section with respect to the azimuthal angle and the recoil momentum of the electron . in the concluding section we present the correction to the cross - section and asymmetry , together with some numerical estimates .",
    "some details of the calculation may be found in the appendix .",
