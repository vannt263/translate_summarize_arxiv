    "this article is concerned with certain special representatives of dynamically defined cohomology classes , mainly motivated by the theory of maximizing measures ( see e.g.  @xcite for some background to this area ) . given a continuous self - map @xmath9 of a compact metric space @xmath10 , let @xmath11 denote the set of @xmath0-invariant borel probability measures . for a continuous function @xmath12 , a measure @xmath13 is called _ maximizing _ if @xmath14 .",
    "one method of determining the maximizing measure(s ) for a function @xmath6 consists of finding a continuous function @xmath15 such that the set @xmath16 of maxima of @xmath17 carries _ carries _ a measure @xmath18 if the ( topological ) support of @xmath18 , which we always denote by @xmath19 , is contained in @xmath20 .",
    "] at least one @xmath0-invariant measure .",
    "the maximizing measures for @xmath6 ( and for @xmath21 ) are then precisely those invariant measures carried by @xmath22 .",
    "it is known that such @xmath15 always exist if the map @xmath0 has some hyperbolicity and there is an appropriate control on the modulus of continuity of the function @xmath6 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is an expanding map , and @xmath6 is lipschitz , the function @xmath15 may be chosen so that @xmath23 , i.e.  the set of maxima of @xmath21 contains at least one pre - image of every point in @xmath10 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm .  1 ) ) . in this case",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath22 carries at least one invariant measure . in certain situations",
    "it may be possible to choose @xmath21 such that @xmath22 contains _ precisely one _ pre - image of every point in @xmath10 ; in this case we may think of the function @xmath6 as determining a particular selection of pre - images of @xmath0 .",
    "the topology of the space @xmath10 may , however , preclude @xmath22 from containing exactly one pre - image of every point ; for example this is the case if @xmath24 is the circle , where no closed subset @xmath25 is mapped bijectively onto @xmath1 by an expanding map @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , it may be the case that with _",
    "finitely many exceptions _ , every point in @xmath1 has a unique pre - image in @xmath26 .",
    "for example if @xmath27 is defined by @xmath28 and @xmath29 is any closed semi - circle , then apart from the common image of the endpoints of @xmath29 , every point in @xmath1 has a unique pre - image in @xmath29 .",
    "more generally we may choose @xmath29 to be the union of a finite number of disjoint closed intervals with the property that the only points in @xmath1 without a unique pre - image in @xmath29 are the images of the boundary points in @xmath29 .",
    "such sets @xmath29 have been studied by brmont @xcite , who called them _ ( finite ) flowers _ ( some examples of flowers are depicted in figure  [ flowers ] in section [ sectiontwo ] ) .    when @xmath28 , bousch @xcite has shown that if @xmath30 is any trigonometric polynomial of degree one then indeed there exists @xmath31 such that @xmath22 is a closed semi - circle ( i.e.  @xmath6 satisfies the so - called _ sturmian condition _ , cf .",
    "@xcite ) . since",
    "closed semi - circles have the notable property of carrying one , and only one , @xmath0-invariant measure ( so - called _ sturmian _ measures , see e.g.  @xcite ) , he deduced that every degree - one trigonometric polynomial has a unique maximizing measure , and that this measure is sturmian .",
    "the analogous result has been obtained in @xcite for a certain family of piecewise linear functions , and experimental evidence suggests that sturmian maximizing measures appear rather often for sufficiently simple functions @xmath6 .",
    "if a lipschitz function @xmath6 is known to have a sturmian maximizing measure might be a degree - one trigonometric polynomial , or a piecewise linear function as in @xcite .",
    "] then a natural problem is to determine precisely _ which _ of the sturmian measures is @xmath6-maximizing",
    ". we will establish ( see theorem [ flattentheorem ] ) the following useful necessary condition for a sturmian measure @xmath7 to be @xmath6-maximizing : there exists a closed semi - circle @xmath29 carrying @xmath7 , and a lipschitz function @xmath15 , such that the restriction of @xmath32 to @xmath29 is a constant function .",
    "this condition was introduced by bousch @xcite , who referred to it as the _ pre - sturmian _ condition since it is clearly implied by his sturmian condition mentioned above .",
    "the content of theorem [ flattentheorem ] is that for lipschitz @xmath6 whose maximizing measure is sturmian yet which do _ not _ satisfy the sturmian condition ( such @xmath6 exist , cf .",
    "example  [ notmax ] ) , the pre - sturmian condition is still satisfied ( on some semi - circle carrying the maximizing measure ) .",
    "the practical utility of theorem [ flattentheorem ] stems from the fact that , as noted by bousch , solving the pre - sturmian condition for @xmath29 amounts to solving a _ real - valued _ equation .",
    "this real - valued equation , which appears explicitly in @xcite , and as a particular case of our theorem [ equivalent ] , can be solved numerically ( cf .  remark [ zerofinding ] ) .",
    "it should be contrasted to the _ functional _ equation ( namely , @xmath33 , cf .",
    "@xcite ) which , a priori , must be solved for @xmath15 in order to check the sturmian condition ( which in any case may not be satisfied , cf .",
    "example [ notmax ] ) .    in the above discussion of the sturmian and pre - sturmian conditions",
    "the expanding map was assumed , for simplicity , to be @xmath34 .",
    "in fact theorem [ flattentheorem ] is formulated in terms of arbitrary ( orientation - preserving ) lipschitz expanding maps of the circle . in this general setting , closed semi - circles are replaced by @xmath8-flowers ( i.e.  flowers with a single connected component ) .",

    "these are formally introduced in section [ sectiontwo ] , in terms of _ pre - image selectors _ ( roughly , a pre - image selector is an inverse map for @xmath35 ) . in section [ sectionthree ]",
    "we consider the generalization of the pre - sturmian condition to arbitrary @xmath5-flowers @xmath29 : for a lipschitz function @xmath6 , if there exists a lipschitz @xmath15 such that @xmath36 is a constant function , we say that @xmath6 is _ lipschitz flattened _ on @xmath29 ( see figure  [ flattened_functions ] in section [ sectionthree ] ) .",
    "theorem [ equivalent ] characterises this situation in terms of an explicit vector - valued equation in @xmath37 . as with the real - valued equation arising from the pre - sturmian condition , this vector - valued equation can in practice",
    "be solved numerically in order to determine those @xmath5-flowers @xmath29 on which @xmath6 can be lipschitz flattened .    although nonlinear in @xmath29 , the @xmath5 constraints detailed in theorem [ equivalent ] depend linearly on the lipschitz function @xmath6 .",
    "theorem [ independentfunctionals ] asserts that these constraints are independent ; in other words , the space @xmath38 of lipschitz functions which can be lipschitz flattened on a given @xmath5-flower @xmath29 is of codimension @xmath5 in the space of all lipschitz functions .",
