    "this one - dimensional helical edge state electrons are protected by trs@xcite and are free of spin - flip backscatterings@xcite . as a result , they lead to perfect transmission in charge transport along the edge@xcite .    a simple theoretical model was first introduced by haldane@xcite and later proposed by kane and mele@xcite ( the km model ) to capture the helical edge states of qshis . the km model was aimed to describe edge states in graphene .",

    "for @xmath6 , a finite energy gap is found at half filling where the fermi energy is at the dirac point @xmath8 .",
    "this small gap is due to breaking of the sublattice translational invariance at the boundaries , and can be explained in terms of an effective finite single - particle inter - edge tunneling , which decays exponentially with increasing @xmath9 .",

    "our stability analysis of the kmh ribbon is summarized as follows . for @xmath6 ,",
    "the energy gap at half - filled at the dirac point gives rise to a charge and spin gaped ( insulating ) ( ii ) phase@xcite ; at a generic filling , however , the two - particle processes when combined with the effect of the hubbard @xmath2 term lead to the instabilities of the helical edge states towards a charge gapless but spin gaped ( ci ) phase@xcite in the rg analysis via the kosterlitz - thouless type of quantum phase transitions .",
