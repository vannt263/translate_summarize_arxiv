    "in many contexts , technological progress and innovation is essential to national or regional economic growth and output .",
    "one way of measuring innovation is the production of patents , which represent a technological advancement produced by individuals ( generally , these are inventors on the patents ) working at research institutions ( generally , these are the assignees on the patent ) .",
    "the analysis of patent databases has provided techniques for evaluating information spillovers @xcite , inventor mobility between regions @xcite , interregional and international collaborations @xcite , and the emergence of new technologies @xcite . among many others , these studies",
    "have provided an in - depth picture of the dynamics of regional and institutional talents and quantify the success of various inter - institutional and inter - regional collaboration , of great use to policy makers .",
    "a major problem in the use of patent data ( or any bibliometric database , such as for scholarly publications @xcite ) is the disambiguation of authors or institutions .",
    "there are a wide range of alternate spellings of a person s or institution s name , where , for example , `` the national institutes of health '' and `` nih '' may refer to the same institution .",
    "typos and misspellings of names are also common in bibliographic data ( e.g. `` national institute of health , '' missing an ` s ' in the second word , is assignee on 24 patents worldwide ) .",
    "the goal of disambiguation is to link all of these alternate spellings of institutional or individual names _ without _ incorrectly linking similar names referring to distinct entities .",
    "this is a difficult task , as there are millions of names to disambiguate ( making pairwise comparisons of the full dataset computationally expensive ) and an evaluation of how likely two names on patents are to be the same entity is not known a priori and often relies on machine learning techniques @xcite .    in this paper , we describe a straightforward but accurate approach to the disambiguation problem using high precision geolocation of assignee and inventor addresses .",
    "two inventors ( or two assignees ) that provide exactly the same high - resolution address and _ also _ have ` similar ' names are very likely to refer to the same entity . knowing that two entities have exactly the same address allows a great deal of flexibility in name matching , and we design two simple string matching approaches to link similar names that share a high - resolution geolocation . inventors and assignees that have addresses with low resolution , which are extremely common in the uspto data ( @xmath0 of inventor addresses have no street provided ) , are linked to exact name matches nearby , greatly increasing the coverage of the disambiguation .",
    "we show that this approach provides a complete , high - resolution disambiguation of inventors and assignees on 3.6 million patents , and that the precision and recall of the resulting disambiguation is superior to or competitive with other well known disambiguation methods on that subset of the patent data .",
    "the primary advantages of this methodology over existing disambiguation approaches are threefold .",
    "first , the assignee disambiguation appears robust and of a broader scope than is found in other methodologies in the literature@xcite .",
    "the assignment of unique institutional identifiers to these assignee names will allow a better understanding of inter - institutional mobility of inventors and institutional collaborations , a significant benefit provided by this dataset .",
    "second , the fact that the inventor disambiguation works well in comparison to more refined inventor disambiguation techniques@xcite over a significant fraction of patents worldwide suggests that our dataset can be useful in understanding inventor collaborations or mobility .",
    "finally , the use of both us- and european - centric patent offices ensures that we have a global focus in our data , with a good chance of linking assignees and inventors found in multiple offices at similar addresses .",
    "the fundamental difficulty that must be overcome in name disambiguation is the possibility of alternate or error - ridden spellings of names or addresses in the database .",
    "two examples of names requiring disambiguation are depicted in fig .",
    "[ examples.fig ] : some of the names associated the national institutes of health ( nih ) in bethesda md ( assignee on @xmath1 patents ) , and some of the names associated with a prolific inventor , rosa maria cuberes - altisent , in the barcelona area ( inventing @xmath2 patents ) . in both cases , the subsets of names shown in the white boxes of fig .",
    "[ examples.fig ] indicate the extreme heterogeneity in some inventor or assignee names , with at least 84 unique alternate spellings for the nih and 24 unique alternate spellings for rosa maria cuberes - altisent .",
    "disambiguation of these names requires not only matching all of the possible variations in the spelling of the institution or individual , but also _ not _ matching other names that refer to different entities with similar names .",
    "for example , the national institute of health of japan has multiple patents under the name `` national institute of health , '' which we do not want to link to the nih in bethesda , and likewise an inventor with the name `` jose maria duran - altisent '' ( inventing at least 4 patents in the madrid area ) should not be linked to rosa maria s identity despite the similarities in their names . a wide range of methods of varying complexity",
    "have been generated to solve this disambiguation problem for authors of publications @xcite , patent assignees @xcite , and patent inventor names @xcite ( with the disambiguation of li et .",
    "al @xcite a recent and comprehensive result for the uspto ) . in the case of inventor disambiguation , these methods will generally compare pairs of names using the similarity of the text of the names as well as data regarding the assignees , patent citations , patent classes , and geographical information .",
    "the geographical information found in the uspto typically suffers from low quality addresses , where less than 5% of uspto inventors complete the street field in their address on the patent ( and city- or zipcode - level information is the highest resolution available ) . at this level",
    ", geolocation can be used as one of many rough indicators of the similarity between two names when comparing them for disambiguation .",
    "however , patents in the epo or pct databases are found to contain higher resolution addresses in a far greater fraction of cases ( where a street number , street , city , state , and zip code are often all provided ) , which can provide much greater specificity when comparing inventors : if two inventors have ` similar ' names _ and _ live at exactly the same address , it is far more likely they refer to the same person than if they had ` similar ' names and lived in the same general area .",
    "the same state of affairs exists for assignee names , with the epo and pct addresses often having street - level information and the uspto addresses tending to be of low quality .    ) , after which there is a search for ` similar ' names at exact high resolution lat / longs ( the meaning of ` similar ' is discussed in sec .",
    "[ assigneeexact.sec ] for assignees and sec .",
    "[ inventorexact.sec ] for inventors ) .",
    "once similar names are clustered at each lat / long , ` nearby ' exact name matches are linked ( described in sec .",
    "[ nearby.sec ] ) .",
    "exact name matches for inventors that are not ` nearby ' are checked for additional characteristics in common before a link is made ( described in sec .",
    "[ mobile.sec ] ) . ]    our strategy for disambiguation will be to leverage these high precision addresses by flexibly matching names that are simultaneously found at exact , high - precision geolocations in any patent office , then to match ` nearby ' names that are exactly the same . the general idea is sketched in fig .",
    "[ examples.fig ] for specific assignee and inventor names , and a schematic of the methodology is diagrammed in fig .",
    "[ schematic.fig ] . a detailed summary of each step can be found in the appendix .",
    "we first geolocate the assignees and inventor addresses for every patent in the three databases ( @xmath3 million unique addresses ) using yahoo s yql api @xcite , converting the text into likely latitude / longitude ( lat / long ) pairs and the quality of that geolocation ( step 1 in fig .",
    "[ schematic.fig ] ) .",
    "the quality returned by yql generally indicates @xcite if the geolocation was resolved at the level of a point ( e.g. `` 55 fruit street , boston , ma , usa '' ) , line ( e.g. `` fruit street , boston , ma , usa '' ) , zip code ( e.g. `` 02114 ma usa '' ) , city ( e.g. `` boston , ma , usa '' ) , state ( e.g. `` ma , usa '' ) , or country ( e.g. `` usa '' ) . for every high - quality geolocation we attempt to flexibly match similar strings ( step 2 in fig .",
    "[ schematic.fig ] ) , with specific examples in fig .",
    "[ examples.fig ] : assignees with names involving ` institute ' or ` health ' at identical lat / longs are likely to be referring to the nih , and inventors with names like ` cuberes ' and ` rosa ' at identical lat / longs are likely referring to rosa maria cuberes - altisent . after this first round of disambiguation ( which depends strongly on the existence of high - resolution geolocation information for the names ) we search for exact name matches that were geolocated to a lat / long pair of _ any _ quality within 20 km ( step 3 in fig .",
    "[ schematic.fig ] ) . in fig . 1 , we link the names at the indicated high - resolution geolocations due to the simultaneous name matchings of `` national institutes of health '' and `` cuberes altisent , rosa ''",
    ". we also link occurrences of `` national institutes of health '' with the low - quality geolocations from addresses of `` bethesda , md , usa '' or `` rockville , md , usa '' that commonly occur in the uspto , since those names are found within 20 km of each other . having produced disambiguated assignee and inventor identifiers locally",
    ", we perform a final search for inventors that are mobile ( where the same individual provides addresses more than 20 km apart ; step 4 in fig .",
    "[ schematic.fig ] ) .",
    "similarity between inventors of the same name beyond the 20 km threshold is evaluated using additional indicators : self - citations , shared co - assignees , shared co - inventors , and patent family overlap .",
    "our approach produces a total of @xmath4800k unique assignee identifiers , @xmath55.5 m unique local inventor ids , and links @xmath4800k mobile inventors worldwide into @xmath6k unique inventor ids in the three patent offices , covering @xmath49.1 m patents . because our method is heavily dependent on high resolution geolocations of addresses , it is often important to distinguish between assignees or inventors that are linkable to high - quality addresses ( e.g. the `` national institutes of health '' in `` bethesda , md , usa '' can be linked to the high - resolution geolocation in fig .",
    "[ examples.fig ] , despite it being a low resolution geolocation ) and those that can not ( e.g. `` sony corp '' always provides the low - quality address `` tokyo jp , '' and can never be linked to a high - resolution geolocation ) .",
    "names that can not be linked to a high resolution address are incapable of being disambiguated for alternate spellings ( since we only look for _ exact _ name matches when attempting to match names with low - resolution geolocations ) .",
    "we find a total of @xmath4290k disambiguated assignees with at least one high - resolution address , @xmath41.7 m disambiguated inventors with at least one high - resolution address , and @xmath4275k mobile inventors merged into @xmath4 190k high - resolution inventor ids .",
    "as shown in table [ summarytable.tab ] , the coverage of high - resolution disambiguations is best in the epo and worst in the uspto , and the coverage of complete assignee disambiguation tends to be higher than that of inventor disambiguation .",
    "these high resolution disambiguations provides complete coverage of every assignee and inventor on 3,583,475 patents worldwide ( 44% in the epo , 25% in the pct , and 31% in the uspto ) , and partial disambiguation ( at least one assignee or inventor disambiguated with a high - resolution address ) on @xmath46.0 m patents worldwide .",
    ".summary of the coverage of the disambiguation in the three patent offices ( patent count in millions ) . listed",
    "are the number of patents having an assignee or inventor ( note that these fields may be blank ) ; the number of patents with any address information on the level of street , city , or zip code ; the number of patents for which _ at least one _ of those entities is disambiguated with a link to a high resolution address ; and the number of patents for which _ all _ of those names are disambiguated with a link to a high resolution address .",
    "the percentages refer to the ratio of patents with a high - resolution disambiguation for every entity on the patent to the number of patents with at least one inventor or assignee name provided .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we note that inventors or assignees without any provided address are not linked to any patents at all using this approach .",
    "this is a more significant problem for patents in the uspto than in the epo or pct , because in the us office there are @xmath41.5 m patents that have an assignee name but no assignee address provided .",
    "the approaches to disambiguation in secs [ assigneeexact.sec]-[nearby.sec ] provide a disambiguation of institutions and inventors , but only within a @xmath420 km radius . while assignees are generally expected to remain in a fixed and localized position ( neglecting the possibility that the same company moves from one city to another ) , inventors are far more likely to move from one city to another",
    ". our algorithm would be incapable of linking the names of mobile inventors , since the distance between their geolocations would be well above our threshold of 20 km . in order to overcome this limitation , we must add one final step to the disambiguation algorithm that allows for inventor name matching over greater distances .",
    "we do this by searching for exact name matches that are ` similar ' to one another in a manner other than distance .",
    "in particular , we link a pair of disambiguated inventor ids that share an _ exact _ name match if any of the patents held by those inventors      a total of 2.7 m pairs of potentially linked disambiguated ids are observed in the data , where the same inventor name is found in distant locations . of those ,",
    "991,158 ids satisfy at least one of the constraints for distant linking ( i.e. the names share some other characteristic in common ) , and are linked using our algorithm .",
    "this reduces 800,665 unique inventor ids generated from the previous local disambiguation to 358,288 aggregated ids that are used for the final inventor identifiers , a reduction of @xmath48% in the total number of inventor ids . of those aggregated ids ,",
    "188,726 ( @xmath453% of the aggregated ids ) involve at least one inventor with a high - precision geolocation and 58,985 ( @xmath4 16% ) involve inventors that _ all _ have high resolution geolocations .",
    "inventors that can be linked to one high - precision geolocation are often focused on in the main text , and we emphasize that we do not require high resolutions in every city , but rather high resolutions in at least one city .",
    "for example , two linked names that have the addresses `` tokyo jp '' and `` 123 main street , boston ma usa '' _ would _ be labeled as a high - resolution inventor , since the address in boston has the potential for being accurately disambiguated using our method .      when parsing the names , all latin characters are converted into lowercase letters .",
    "all accented letters are converted into the character ` x ' ( this has the affect of penalizing the removal of an accent , but not penalizing the change of an accent in a name ) . all symbols ( e.g. ` - ' or ` . ' ) are converted into spaces . after this , words composed of a single character are deleted and all double - spaces , triple - spaces , etc . are converted to a space .    for assignees , a specific list of @xmath7 words",
    "are deleted from the names before passing through to disambiguation ( for example , ` inc ' , ` corporation ' , ` aktiengesellschaft ' , and ` the ' ) .",
    "the designation of words to completely delete before disambiguation were made manually , and altering this list may change the results to some extent .    for inventor names ,",
    "a few words are dropped from the names : `` dr '' , `` de '' , `` da '' , `` di '' `` mc '' , `` von '' , `` der '' , `` van '' , and `` den '' . these short words tend to be non - informative within the last name of individuals , and cause problems with our algorithm if they are treated as a ` first name .
