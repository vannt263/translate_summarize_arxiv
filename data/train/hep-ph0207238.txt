    "in order to obtain more information about the interior of the earth , neutrino tomography has been considered as an alternative method to geophysics . there exist , in principle , two different such techniques , neutrino absorption tomography  @xcite and neutrino oscillation tomography  @xcite .",
    "neutrino absorption tomography , based on the absorption of neutrinos in matter , is in some sense similar to x - ray tomography and unfortunately faces several problems including the need of extremely high energetic neutrino sources , huge detectors , and the prerequisite of many baselines .",
    "neutrino oscillation tomography uses the fact that neutrino oscillations are influenced by the presence of matter  @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillation tomography would , in principle , be possible with a single baseline , since interference effects provide additional information on the matter density profile .",
    "however , it requires quite precise knowledge about the neutrino oscillation parameters and stringent bounds on the contribution of non - oscillation physics , such as neutrino decay , cpt violation , non - standard interactions , sterile neutrinos , _ etc .",
    "_ supernovae as neutrino sources are especially interesting , since the neutrinos come in large numbers from a short burst , which could be used to obtain a snapshot of the earth s interior .",
    "in addition , compared to solar neutrinos , their energy spectrum has a high - energy tail , which is more sensitive to earth matter effects .",
    "the influence of earth matter on supernova neutrinos has , for example , been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we assume that technologically feasible detectors exist , such as super - kamiokande , sno , hyper - kamiokande , and uno , which are originally built for different purposes , but also capable to detect supernova neutrinos .",
    "we discuss the possibility to use the neutrinos coming from a future galactic supernova explosion to determine with the assumed detectors some of the measurable quantities describing the structure of the earth s interior .",
    "we especially focus on the outer and inner core of the earth , since they are much harder to access with conventional geophysical methods than the mantle of the earth .",
    "in geophysics , the most promising technique to access the earth s interior is to use seismic wave propagation ( for a summary , see refs .",
    "especially , the detection of seismic waves produced by earthquakes gives valuable information on the seismic wave velocity profile of the earth matter .",
    "however , the matter density is not directly accessible , but indirectly obtained by assumptions about the equation of state of the considered materials . since seismic s - waves",
    "are mainly reflected at the mantle - core boundary , information on the earth s core is much harder to obtain than on the earth s mantle .",
    "therefore , we will especially focus on the earth s core in this paper .",
    "since reflection and refraction of p - waves at transition boundaries with large matter density contrasts are quite easy to observe with seismic waves , the mantle - core and outer core - inner core boundaries can be located with high precision as well as the matter density jumps can be measured . for example , the matter density jump at the outer core - inner core boundary is often given by @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "this is quite a difference compared to neutrino physics , since neutrino oscillations in matter are especially sensitive to the average matter densities ( on the scale of the neutrino oscillation length ) indirectly measured by the electron density .",
    "thus , neutrino oscillations are less sensitive to local differences , but they involve less unknowns from the equation of state and could therefore access the absolute matter densities instead of the matter density jumps .    several issues regarding the earth s inner core are considered to be interesting from a geophysical point of view . for different indirect reasons the inner core is believed to consist mainly of iron and it is therefore often called the iron core .",
    "first of all , the spectral lines in the sunlight indicate that the atmosphere of the sun partly consists of iron as a potential material source for the planets .",
    "a second hint comes from the magnetic field of the earth .",
    "after all , there are no convincing alternatives .",
    "we will see later that neutrino tomography could directly verify the average matter density of an iron core .",
    "further topics relevant for the inner core structure are : anisotropy , heterogeneity , time - dependence , solidity , and rotation ( for a summary , see ref .",
    "however , since neutrino oscillations are to a good approximation only sensitive to average matter densities at long scales , these issues are much harder to access with neutrino oscillation tomography .",
    "core - collapse supernovae represent the evolutionary end of massive stars with a mass @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mass of the sun . in these explosions ,",
    "about 99  % of the liberated gravitational binding energy , @xmath3 erg , is carried away by neutrinos in roughly equal amounts of energy for all flavors in the first 10 seconds after the onset of the core collapse  @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that the time - dependent energy spectrum of each neutrino species can be approximated by a `` pinched '' fermi  dirac distribution  @xcite . in this work , we assume that the time - integrated spectra can also be well approximated by the pinched fermi ",
    "dirac distributions with an effective degeneracy parameter @xmath4 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the total neutrino energy of a certain flavor @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the neutrino energy and the effective temperature , respectively .",
    "the relation between the average neutrino energy and the effective neutrino temperature is given by @xmath11 in this section , we assume for simplicity that @xmath12 for all neutrino flavors , which means that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the riemann z - function [ @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , the time - integrated flux of the neutrinos can be expressed by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the distance to the supernova .    due to the different trapping processes ,",
    "the different neutrino flavors originate in layers of the supernova with different temperatures .",
    "the electron ( anti)neutrino flavor is kept in thermal equilibrium by @xmath19 processes up to a certain radius usually referred to as the `` neutrinosphere '' , beyond which the neutrinos stream off freely . however , the practical absence of muons and taus in the supernova core implies that the other two neutrino flavors , here collectively denoted by @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , interact primarily by less efficient neutral - current processes .",
    "therefore , their spectra are determined at deeper , _",
    "i.e. _ , hotter , regions . in addition , since the content of neutrons is larger than that of protons , @xmath22",
    "s escape from outer regions than @xmath23 s .",
    "this rough picture leads to the following hierarchy : @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath20 refers again to both @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "typical values of the average energies of the time - integrated neutrino spectra obtained in simulations are @xmath27 mev , @xmath28 mev , and @xmath29 mev @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies with an improved treatment of neutrino transport , microphysics , the inclusion of the nucleon bremsstrahlung , and the energy transfer by recoils , find somewhat smaller differences between the @xmath30 and @xmath20 spectra  @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we assume a future galactic supernova explosion at a typical distance of @xmath31  kpc , with a binding energy of @xmath32  erg and a total energy of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 parameterizes a possible deviation from energy equipartition  @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the fluxes of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are identical and we fix @xmath37 to 15  mev . due to the current lack of a standard picture of core - collapse supernovae we consider for our analysis six scenarios for @xmath12 with different values of the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 , as shown in tab .",
    "[ snscenarios ] .",
    "in addition , we study four scenarios with @xmath40 and @xmath41 as well as @xmath42 and @xmath43 . as far as the neutrino detection is concerned , we only analyze the charged - current reaction @xmath44 , since this reaction yields the largest number of events ( around 8000 in the super - kamiokande detector in the case of a galactic supernova ) . therefore , we shall concentrate on the study of the propagation of antineutrinos from a supernova to detectors on the earth . the cross section details for the reaction @xmath44 can be found and are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".our standard scenarios for supernova parameters , where in all cases @xmath45 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     estimates for the precision of the supernova parameter determinations depend on the initial values considered .",
    "thus , the more different the @xmath30 and @xmath35 spectra are formed in a supernova explosion , the stronger the oscillation effects are , and therefore , the better one can measure the neutrino temperatures and luminosities . as an example , we show in tab .",
    "[ snparams ] the sensitivities obtained in refs .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , this table shows the estimated influences on the determination of our parameters from a variation of the supernova parameters in the numerical evaluation .",
    "the reason for the similar percentage effects for super - kamiokande and hyper - kamiokande is the parallel scaling of both problems .",
    "it is interesting to observe that none of the supernova parameters has a strong influence on the tomography problem except from the overall energy of the muon antineutrinos @xmath46 .",
    "one can show that this parameter has to be known up to about 20  % for the super - kamiokande measurement and 3  % - 4  % for the hyper - kamiokande measurement in order not to have strong effects on the tomography problem .",
    "however , this precision can not be achieved by measuring the electron flavor only .",
    "altogether , either @xmath46 needs to be measured by different experiments or the fluxes of the muon and tau antineutrinos need to be determined simultaneously with the electron antineutrino flux , making the supernova parameters entirely drop out .",
    "this can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluxd1 ] ) , which allows the reconstruction of all mass fluxes at the detector @xmath47 if all flavor fluxes are measured .",
    "another issue in the discussion of uncertainties is the parameter @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) relating the number of electrons to the number of nucleons .",
    "since the earth matter effects in neutrino oscillations actually depend on the electron density and not on the matter density directly , additional uncertainties enter in the conversion of these two quantities by the parameter @xmath48 .",
    "we assumed @xmath49 in our calculations , but for different materials this parameter can differ somewhat from this value  especially in the inner core . in order to find out the material in each matter density layer",
    ", one may prefer to measure the electron density instead of the matter density .",
    "however , since in each layer these quantities are proportional to each other , the problem does not change by using the matter density and the electron density can be easily calculated .",
    "so far , we have assumed the average mantle matter density to be known exactly .",
    "in fact , matter density uncertainties up to 5  % have been documented ( for a summary , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . testing these uncertainties ,",
    "even the conservative choice of a 5  % uncertainty on the average mantle density is no problem for the super - kamiokande detector .",
    "however , for the hyper - kamiokande detector , it should not be larger than about 2  % .",
    "because of a partial averaging out of the uncertainties for the very long baselines considered in this paper , this uncertainty should be quite realistic  @xcite .",
    "another source of uncertainty has to do with the knowledge of the location of a supernova , since it may affect the baseline length . in a future core - collapse supernova in our galaxy ,",
    "the electromagnetic radiation can be obscured by dust in the interstellar space . in this case , the localization of the supernova can be done by studying neutrino - electron forward scattering . a conservative estimate leads to restrict the supernova direction with an error of about @xmath50 in the super - kamiokande detector  @xcite .",
    "however , with the increase of statistics expected in a megaton detector , this uncertainty would be reduced . on the other hand ,",
    "complementary information could be inferred by the triangulation method @xcite , namely the direct measurement of the delay of the signal to the two detectors .",
    "therefore , we consider that this small error would not imply a significant change in the long baselines that we are dealing with , since even for a @xmath50 directional uncertainty the baseline length of about @xmath51 does not change very much .",
    "we have discussed the possibility to use the neutrinos from a future galactic supernova explosion to obtain additional information on the earth s core .",
    "first , we have summarized geophysical aspects and unknowns of the earth s core .",
    "then , we have investigated core - collapse supernovae as potential neutrino sources for a snapshot of the earth s interior .",
    "next , we have discussed the neutrino propagation from the production to the detection in detail , where we have especially focused on earth matter effects on the neutrino oscillations of the supernova neutrinos .",
    "we have also put these effects into the context of the supernova parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ , temperatures and deviation from energy equipartition .",
    "furthermore , we have stressed the importance of supernova neutrinos arriving at the surface of the earth as mass eigenstates for this technique , which we have also supported by a discussion of decoherence of neutrino oscillations .",
    "we have shown that we need one detector on the surface of the earth on the side towards the supernova , and another one in the shadow of the earth s core .",
    "for the most likely scenario of not crossing the earth s inner core , we have shown that the earth s average core matter density could be determined up to 9  % with a super - kamiokande - like and 1.3  % with a hyper - kamiokande - like detector ( all errors at the @xmath52 confidence level ) .",
    "in addition , for a less likely two - parameter measurement of the outer and inner core matter densities , hyper - kamiokande could verify the existence of the inner core at the @xmath53 confidence level and measure the outer core matter density with a precision of about 3.1  % , as well as the density jump between outer and inner core matter densities with a precision of about 59  % .",
    "the latter error is comparable to seismic wave geophysics , where , however , not the difference between the average matter densities , but the matter density jump at the outer - inner core boundary is measured .",
    "thus , neutrino physics could provide complementary information to geophysics .",
    "however , the quoted numbers for the precisions depend on the supernova parameter values , indirectly determined by the on - the - surface measurement , and are in some cases better , in others worse .",
    "thus , the actual precisions will not be known before the supernova goes off . in general , we find that the more muon and tau neutrinos are produced , the larger the temperature difference between the different flavors is , and the more different the degeneracy parameters for the different flavors are , the better the application works . finally , we have discussed several uncertainties to these measurements and we have found that especially the determination of the total muon antineutrino energy of the supernova causes problems to our method .",
    "however , measuring not only electron antineutrinos , but also the other two flavors could completely eliminate the dependence on the supernova parameters .",
    "furthermore , the leading solar neutrino parameters have to be known with sufficient precision , which is about 0.2  % for hyper - kamiokande - like measurements . in summary ,",
    "supernova neutrino tomography could be a nice additional payoff of existing or planned detectors if all of the prerequisites can be met at the time when the next supernova explodes .",
