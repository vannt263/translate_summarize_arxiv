    "high - resolution x - ray observations from the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and _ xmm - newton _ offer a new window with which to study the ism .",
    "the ism affects x - ray spectra in two ways : photoelectric absorption , particularly at low energies , and scattering by dust grains , producing x - ray halos . at x - ray energies ,",
    "absorption features are from the excitation and ionization of inner - shell ( @xmath0-shell ) electrons , although for high-@xmath8 elements like iron , @xmath9-shell absorption edges are also detectable . the wavelength range available to _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ includes absorption features from carbon through iron .",
    "since the abundances of these elements are substantially lower than for hydrogen and helium , x - ray studies can probe the ism over larger distances than is possible in the optical and ultraviolet .",
    "measurements of the ism absorption features in the spectra of x - ray binaries will allow us to study the abundances and ionization fractions for a large number of elements .",
    "this study is analogous to optical and ultraviolet observations of stars and quasars that measure ism and intergalactic medium absorption features .",
    "x - ray binaries are the brightest objects in the x - ray sky and therefore require only moderate observation lengths to produce high signal - to - noise spectra .",
    "an understanding of the ism absorption features is also important for determining the intrinsic spectral properties of x - ray sources .",
    "early photoelectric absorption models assumed that the ism was composed of a neutral , monoatomic , homogeneous gas with solar abundances ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite were the first to compute a more complex 2-phase photoelectric absorption model which more closely resembles the actual ism .",
    "improvements in x - ray absorption cross - sections , and solar and ism abundance data , led to updated absorption models @xcite .    while the recent models provide good fits to low- and medium - resolution x - ray spectra , they are not appropriate for the grating spectra available with _",

    "the positions were determined either from low - resolution solid - state data @xcite or from theoretical calculations @xcite , neither of which can be reliably taken as the true atomic edge position .",

    "all of the high - resolution work points to a complex system of absorption features at the oxygen edge , not the simple step function used in absorption models .",
    "the purpose of this work is to compile a large sample of spectra to study the oxygen @xmath0-shell edge complex .",
    "other ism edges will be studied in a future work .",
    "one of our goals is to provide the community with a reasonable model for the oxygen @xmath0-shell edge complex for use in future analyses .",
    "the high - resolution astrophysical data can also be used to test our understanding of the atomic structure that leads to features in photoelectric absorption by comparing with theoretical calculations .",
    "finally , we will study the nature of the ism by measuring the abundances in various ionizations states and studying the uniformity of the ism absorption . combined with similar studies of other edges , high - resolution x - ray spectra will in the future probe relative abundances and depletion in the ism .",
    "the interstellar absorption features found in the x - ray band are due to ionization of inner - shell ( @xmath12 ) electrons in neutral atoms .",
    "this absorption results in a series of absorption edge complexes , one for each element .",
    "the cross - section for each edge has a similar large - scale energy dependence .",
    "photons with energies below the ionization potential can not ionize the atom , and the cross - section is negligible . at the ionization energy ,",
    "the cross - section is large and then decreases roughly as @xmath13 at higher energies .",

    "photons with energy slightly less ( or wavelengths greater ) than the ionization energy can excite the electron into a higher @xmath14 shell .",

    "for oxygen , the ionized o@xmath18 product with a @xmath10 hole can have total spin angular momentum @xmath4 or @xmath3 , producing separate series limits at different energies due to the spin - dependent exchange force .",
    "each series limit has an associated resonance series from neutral oxygen excitations which have the same configuration of the inner shells ( @xmath19 with a @xmath10 hole ) , neglecting the contribution of the valence ( @xmath20 ) electron .",
    "in addition , differences in the total orbital angular momentum @xmath9 of the final state also give rise to different resonance series .",

    "* ) , but these will produce weaker features since they require both a promotion of a @xmath10-@xmath16 electron and a transition in the @xmath31 subshell . these weaker features are undetectable with current x - ray observatories .    to calculate the theoretical photoelectric absorption cross - sections , one must solve the schrdinger equation . for atoms with only one electron ( hydrogen - like )",
    "this calculation is straightforward and exactly solvable , but as the number of electrons in the atom increases , so does the complexity of the calculation .",
    "multi - electron atoms require numerical methods to solve for the cross - sections .",
    "such methods are only able to approximate the solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "there are a number of numerical techniques employed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) . the preferred method for calculating cross - sections that include resonance structure is the r - matrix method .",
    "while the structure and strength of the cross - sections calculated using the r - matrix method compare well with laboratory measurements , the absolute positions are different .",
    "this results from the truncation of the wavefunction description of the resulting ion , which is necessary to keep the computation manageable . in practice ,",

    "there is some discrepancy between the predicted optical depth of oxygen ( based on the behavior of the carbon optical depth ) and the measured oxygen optical depth , which is not understood @xcite . since all of our observations were taken before october 2002 , the contaminant contribution to the oxygen optical depth is @xmath50.10 for all observations , which translates to less than 10% of the total instrumental edge",

    "a curve of growth describes the relationship between the line ew and the absorbing column density and can be separated into 3 regimes of column density dependence : linear , flat , and square - root . in the linear regime , the absorption line is not saturated and the ew does not depend on the doppler broadening of the line , yielding a linear dependence on the column density ( @xmath50 ) . as the line saturates with increasing @xmath50 ,",
    "the ew becomes explicitly dependent on the doppler broadening as well as on the column density .",
    "this is known as the `` flat part '' of the curve of growth , where the ew is proportional to @xmath69 . finally , as the column density increases further , the lorentzian wings of the line profile dominate .",

    "there seems to be a systematic offset of the data from the expected values , which is possibly attributable to the use of a gaussian function to fit the lines , instead of a lorentzian or voigt profile .",

    "we have moved fully into the flat region of the curve of growth .",

    "previous authors have attributed this line to the @xmath10-@xmath11 transition of neutral oxygen bound in compounds @xcite .",

    "the molecular edge had an edge wavelength of 23.13   , similar to the position found by @xcite for the oxygen edge in cyg  x-1 .",
    "this higher wavelength edge coincides with our identified absorption features , which could resemble an edge feature in lower resolution spectra . in the cyg x-1 spectrum of @xcite",
    ", there is a significant count excess on the shorter wavelength side of the edge and at the time , this excess was attributed to either an instrumental effect or to emission lines from the source .",
    "our model is more successful in fitting this structure ( see figure 3 ) .    other authors @xcite have previously identified the @xmath10-@xmath11 line and the line at 23.35   in the spectra of x - ray binaries .",
    "the 23.35   line has been attributed to the @xmath10-@xmath11 transition in iron oxides based on the results of @xcite which suggest a narrow absorption feature at @xmath723.3   .",
    "but in addition to the narrow absorption feature , there is a broad edge feature at @xmath722.9   @xcite .",
    "in fact , given the relative cross - section between the narrow line and the edge , the edge should be detectable before the line .",
    "this is opposite of the atomic oxygen cross - sections , where the narrow @xmath10-@xmath11 lines have larger cross - sections than the associated edges .",
    "this edge feature is not required by our data , which is fit well by just the neutral , atomic oxygen edge .",
    "finally , the structure of molecular edges is dependent on the composition of the dust in the ism , which is highly uncertain @xcite .",
    "this , coupled with a lack of laboratory and theoretical results for molecular oxygen cross - sections , makes predicting the position and strength of molecular line features difficult .",
    "we therefore attribute the 23.35   feature to absorption from since we expect ionized oxygen to be present in the ism at the position we determined . in the warm ,",
    "ionized phase of the ism , the ionization of oxygen should track that of hydrogen due to a strong charge exchange process @xcite .",

    "our estimate for @xmath84@xmath85@xmath89 is less than that found for hydrogen , but due to multiple electron ejections during photoionization @xcite , a more accurate comparison should be @xmath90@xmath91@xmath92/n($]@xmath87 . in either case , the presence of is expected at roughly the measured value , supporting our identification .",
    "our data are well fit by our model which includes only neutral and ionized oxygen contributions . but the ism should also contain oxygen in various compounds , including carbon monoxide ( co ) and dust . in x - ray spectra , molecular forms of oxygen should produce a @xmath10-@xmath11 resonance feature at a wavelength shifted from that of atomic oxygen due to the effects of the bonds on the electron energy levels .",
    "we recognize that there are unidentified features in the spectra with strengths comparable to some of the smallest ew features we identify .",
    "it is possible that these features could be attributable to molecular features , though any quantitative statements depend on predictions or measurements of the strength and positions of these features , which are unavailable at this time .",
    "although our data do not require such contributions , we can estimate an upper limit to the amount allowed by our data .",
    "if we take the error estimate for our measured column densities to be the upper limit on the amount of oxygen bound in molecules , and assuming the cross - section for molecular oxygen is comparable to that for atomic , then 1040% of the oxygen can be bound and still not be detected .",
    "a similar limit can be placed if we identify the 23.35   feature as due to a molecular contribution as has been previously suggested @xcite . in this case",
    ", the ratio of molecular to atomic oxygen would be roughly the same as we suggest for / , @xmath710% .",
    "this assumes that the oscillator strength for molecular oxygen , which is unknown , is similar to that of .",
    "these estimates compare well with the expected amount from other studies .",
    "@xcite calculated that the theoretical maximum amount of oxygen which can be found in dust grains is ( o / h)@xmath93  ppm by comparing the ism abundance of oxygen to magnesium , silicon , and iron .",
    "given the measured oxygen abundances in the ism and the sun , they found an average for ( o / h)@xmath94  ppm , which translates to 27% of the oxygen in the ism .",
    "@xcite also found that the amount of oxygen bound in grains varied between lines of sight , from 140% .",
    "higher signal - to - noise spectra will be required to measure the effect of dust and molecules on the oxygen edge in x - ray spectra .",
    "although we have attributed the identified features to interstellar oxygen absorption , we also consider alternative explanations for completeness .",
    "pre - launch studies of the instrumental oxygen absorption features do not show any significant features that would account for the absorption lines we have found , other than the 23.33   absorption line from the obf @xcite .",
    "in addition , the correlation of the line ews with neutral column density would not be seen from an instrumental feature .",
    "instrumental features would be expected to give the same ew regardless of the source and would be seen in observations of all sources , including low column density extragalactic sources , like those used for calibration of the contaminant contribution . we know of no identification of these features in lower column sources .",
    "therefore , we reject an instrumental origin for our detected line features .",
    "that being said , there does seem to be some effect on the ew determinations of the line from the time - dependent contaminant absorption . for most of our data ,",
    "the contaminant effect is small and does not impact our results for the ism .",
    "the most recent observations however , which would have the largest contaminant correction , have lower ews than predicted from the curve of growth of the other data points .",
    "one possible explanation is that there is a non - negligible absorption line in the spectra of the calibration source .",
    "we note that the structure of the oxygen contaminant absorption is primarily taken from a single observation @xcite . by not accounting for ism",
    ", the contaminant correction is larger than necessary , reducing our measured ews , particularly as the correction grows larger .",
    "it is hoped that our study can help the calibration team understand ism contributions to the oxygen edge region in order to more accurately model the contaminant .",
    "additionally , the most recent observations of cyg x-1 also show an excess of counts in the 22.222.6   range . since these are the only observations with this feature , it is again possible that it is due to the effect of the contaminant or the contaminant model .",
    "accepting that the line features are from ionized oxygen species , we must ask the question are these features truly from the ism , or rather do they originate in material local to the x - ray binaries .",
    "the continuum emission from the binaries provide a great source of ionizing radiation , which could create ionization bubbles around the systems .",
    "the amount of ionized oxygen found in each system would depend on the luminosity of the x - ray source , and the density and composition of material surrounding the source . to first order ,",
    "if the density of material is taken to be similar for all systems , the more luminous systems will be able to ionize more oxygen and would then be expected to have the largest measured ews . of our sources ,",
    "cyg x-1 and cyg x-2 are the most luminous , yet cyg x-2 has the some of the smallest measured ews .",
    "this is expected if the ionized material is interstellar , since cyg x-2 also has the smallest neutral oxygen column density from the edge determination .",
    "while the data points do not show a significant trend with column density , most likely due problems with modeling of the contaminant as mentioned previously , the ews of are correlated with the neutral oxygen column density .",
    "given that the sources included in our sample span more than two orders of magnitude in luminosity and several orders of magnitude in orbital separation , it is highly unlikely that the correlation between the ew and the neutral column density could be produced by absorption from material local to the binaries . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation is exactly what is expected if all of the absorption features are interstellar in origin .",
    "along with the lower ionization species found here , we would expect the binaries to produce absorption features from more highly ionized forms of oxygen . of our sources ,",
    "only cyg x-1 has shown other absorption features @xcite , and it is the only source with multiple observations that can be used to study variations of the column densities . in the three observations of cyg x-1 ,",
    "we measure a change of the neutral oxygen column density of a factor of 2 , which seems unreasonably high for variations in the ism .",
    "cyg x-1 is a high - mass x - ray binary system that accretes from the stellar wind of the young , massive companion .",
    "this , combined with the detection of other more highly ionized absorption lines , points to local material in this system . if the fluxes of the observations are compared , we find that obsid 107 has the lowest continuum flux at the oxygen edge region and the highest neutral column density .",
    "the fluxes are larger in obsids 3407 and 3724 with smaller columns .",
    "we postulate that as the flux of cyg x-1 increases , so does the ionization of the local material ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of the dependence on orbital phase ) . in obsids 3407 and 3724 ,",
    "the local material is most likely highly ionized , removing any local contributions to the neutral and low ionization features .",
    "measurements of the other absorption lines may help to verify this hypothesis .",
    "this paper represents the first in a series of studies of the properties of the ism using high - resolution x - ray spectra .",
    "future work will include studies of lower column density sources to map out the curve of growth of the different oxygen absorption lines .",
    "more data will allow us to better constrain the velocity dispersion and ionization fraction of the oxygen in the ism .",
    "additionally , we will perform a similar analysis on the other astrophysically abundant elements , which can be used to study abundances and depletion in the ism .",
    "studies of the ism in x - rays provides a unique opportunity to measure a large variety of elements and ionization states .",
    "some interesting questions that will be addressed in the future are the relationship between the warm , neutral ( wnm ) and warm , ionized ( wim ) phases of the ism and the source of the ionizing flux . from an ultraviolet observation of the galactic halo star hd  93521",
