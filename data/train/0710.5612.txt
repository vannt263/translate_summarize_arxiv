    "the existence of a shear flow layer at the tokamak edge and in ohmic discharges has been known for a long time @xcite .",
    "it was later found that similar edge shear flow layers existed in other confinement devices .",
    "this seems to be a generic feature of confined plasmas . in the last years",
    ", a great deal of attention has been directed to the formation of shear flow layers and the corresponding region of radial electric field gradient to understand the improved confinement regimes .",
    "many of the recent theoretical developments in this direction have been focused on barrier formation @xcite or zonal flows @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "much progress has been done in the visualization of edge turbulence and flows ( @xcite , @xcite ) , including specific applications to the emergence of the shear flow layer in the tj - ii stellarator ( @xcite ) , in which we are especially interested .    here , we want to turn back to the basic plasma edge shear flow layer . in stellarators , unlike in tokamaks , one can operate at densities for which no shear layer is present in the plasma edge , being thus possible to study its formation .    the emergence of the plasma edge shear flow layer as the density increases in the tj - ii stellarator @xcite is shown @xcite to have the characteristic properties of a second order phase transition .",
    "it is consistent @xcite with a simple transition model that couples shear flow amplification by turbulence @xcite with turbulence suppression by sheared flows @xcite .",
    "the model used in interpreting the tj - ii results is based on a transition model @xcite initially introduced to explain the transition from the low confinement mode ( l mode ) to the high confinement mode ( h mode ) @xcite in magnetically confined plasmas .",
    "this model consists of two envelope equations for the fluctuation level and mean poloidal flow .",
    "a later extension of the model @xcite included a third equation to account for the pressure gradient contribution to the radial electric field .",
    "this second model shows the existence of two critical points , the second one causing the first order transition that has been associated with the l to h transition . for this transition",
    "there is a hysteresis cycle and the transition is characterized by an s - curve ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the first critical point leads to a second order transition ( consequently , it does not have a hysteresis cycle ) , which has been identified with the emergence of the plasma edge shear flow layer .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on this second order transition . by excluding the diamagnetic term in the momentum balance equation ,",
    "only this transition is included in the model .",
    "this simplification is reasonable because there is a large range of densities separating the two critical points .",
    "for the same reason , the range of plasma parameters considered is not yet in an l - mode regime .",
    "therefore , we do not expect avalanche - like transport @xcite and the transport terms can be represented by purely diffusive terms .",
    "concretely , we discuss an extension to 1-d of the original model used in comparison with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "in contrast with previous 1-d extensions of the transition model @xcite , here we formulate the reynolds stress term as a momentum conserving term .",
    "the model is defined by three 1-d partial differential equations describing the evolution of the turbulent fluctuation level @xmath0 , the averaged poloidal velocity shear @xmath1 and ( minus ) the pressure gradient @xmath2 .",
    "it predicts a second - order phase transition with order parameter @xmath1 and control parameter @xmath3 , the particle flux , which enters the model through the boundary conditions . for @xmath3 below a critical value @xmath4 the stable stationary solutions",
    "have @xmath5 , whereas for @xmath6 such solutions are unstable and undergo a transition to states with @xmath7 and reduced turbulence fluctuations .    after performing a detailed stability analysis of the model we study two interesting special cases depending on the form of the flow - damping term : collisional drag and collisional diffusion . for both of them",
    "we find reduced equations describing the dynamics of weakly unstable states . in the latter case ,",
    "the reduced equation is closely related to the ginzburg - landau equation for second - order phase transitions . in particular , the stationary solutions of our equation",
    "are exactly those of the ginzburg - landau one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in section ii we introduce the one - dimensional transition model with momentum conservation .",
    "section iii is devoted to the study of the fixed points of the model , their linear stability properties and a general discussion of the critical conditions . in section",
    "iv we consider the dynamics near the critical point .",
    "section v contains the conclusions and an outline of future research lines .",
    "the relevant plasma edge region to which this model is applied corresponds to @xmath8 $ ] , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the minor radius of the plasma .",
    "we take the slab geometry approximation in representing this region and use as coordinate @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 $ ]",
    ".    the fields of our model will be the fluctuation level envelope @xmath13 , the averaged poloidal shear flow @xmath14 and ( minus ) the averaged pressure gradient @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes ensemble average . a suitable one - dimensional generalization of the model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite requires a form of the reynolds stress which conserves momentum . using a pressure - gradient - driven turbulence model and assuming densely packed turbulence",
    ", a quasi - linear calculation yields the following form for the reynolds stress : @xmath17 which is very similar to the expression previously derived in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of zonal flow dynamics .",
    "notice that @xmath18 measures the strength of the reynolds stress and non - zero @xmath19 is needed for the spectrum of the instability to be bounded .    the model discussed in the present work is :    [ eq:1dmodeloldvar ] @xmath20 \\label{eq:1dmodeleo}\\\\ & \\partial_{\\bar t}{{{\\cal u}}}=-\\bar\\mu_1{{\\cal u}}+\\bar\\mu_2\\partial_x^2{{\\cal u}}- \\bar\\alpha_3\\partial_x^2({{\\cal e}}^2{{\\cal u}})- \\bar d_2\\partial_x^2({{\\cal e}}^2\\partial_x^2{{\\cal u}})\\label{eq:1dmodelsigmao}\\\\ & \\partial_{\\bar t } { { \\cal n}}=\\partial_x^2\\left[(\\bar d_3{{\\cal e}}+\\bar d_4){{\\cal n}}\\right].\\label{eq:1dmodelno}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath21 is the linear growth rate of the characteristic instability and @xmath22 is computed from the nonlinear saturation condition of the instability , both in the absence of sheared flow .",
    "the @xmath23 coefficient is derived from the condition of turbulence supression by sheared flow . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are neoclassical diffusivity coefficients , whereas @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the coefficients of anomalous diffusivity multiplying the fluctuation level .",
    "finally , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the coefficients of the collisional flow - damping terms .",
    "we can eliminate the explicit dependence on the parameters @xmath30 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 by means of the following change of variables : @xmath31 and eqs .",

    "finally , we choose the boundary conditions :    @xmath44    where @xmath3 is the particle flux and is the natural control parameter of the model .",
    "it is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ eq:1dmodelsigma ] ) that any fixed point of the model must satisfy @xmath5 .",
    "then , from eq .",
    "( [ eq:1dmodele ] ) we find that @xmath45 .",
    "it only remains to use the boundary condition of @xmath2 at @xmath46 and we finally have that    * there always exists a fixed point @xmath47 * if @xmath48 there exists a second fixed point ( always unstable , see below ) @xmath49    let @xmath50 be a fixed point and linearize the equations ( [ eq:1dmodel ] ) around it : @xmath51 for the fixed point @xmath52 the eigenvalue condition leads to the dispersion relations : @xmath53 it is clear that this fixed point is unstable for any @xmath54 , since the first dispersion relation gives , for @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "the fixed point @xmath57 is more interesting . in this case",
    "we have : @xmath58 the second equation does not give solutions with @xmath59 .",
    "however , the first one can yield an instability .",
    "then , we ask under which conditions @xmath60 is positive . the neutral modes , i.e. the values of @xmath61 for which @xmath62 are given by : @xmath63 which has real solutions @xmath64 if and only if @xmath65    now observe that the boundary conditions imply the quantization of @xmath61 .",
    "namely , @xmath66 therefore ( [ eq : necinscond ] ) is only a necessary condition for the existence of instabilities .",
    "in addition , there must exist some @xmath67 such that @xmath68 .",
    "the critical point is defined by the minimum value of the flux , @xmath4 , for which there exists an unstable mode @xmath69 .",
    "we define @xmath70 . from ( [ eq : gammak ] )",
    "we find that @xmath71 thus , in particular , if @xmath72 there are no unstable modes , no matter how much we increase @xmath3 . if @xmath73 at least @xmath74 can become unstable .",
    "actually , if @xmath75 , there exist @xmath76 potentially unstable modes @xmath77 .",
    "our aim is to find approximate equations for the dynamics of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1dmodel ] ) near ( and above ) the critical point . to that end",
    "we perform an expansion with parameter @xmath78 for small @xmath79 .",
    "explicitly , we take :    @xmath80    ( recall that @xmath81 ) and we perform a rescaling of the coordinates : @xmath82    expanding the equation of @xmath2 gives : @xmath83 whereas the equation for @xmath0 yields : @xmath84 and using ( [ eq : slavingn ] ) we obtain for @xmath85 : @xmath86    consequently , for weakly unstable states , the problem of studying the dynamics of our model consists in finding an approximate equation for the dynamics of @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 being determined at the end of the day from the slaving conditions ( [ eq : slavinge ] ) , ( [ eq : slavingn ] ) .",
    "the form of the reduced equation for @xmath1 is quite different for @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "that is why in the next sections we study the cases @xmath89 ( _ collisional drag _ ) and @xmath88 ( _ collisional diffusion _ ) separately .",
    "if the collisionality at the plasma edge is high enough , the damping is essentially diffusive and the limit @xmath88 is a good approximation . at low collisionality",
    "the magnetic pumping dominates and the relevant limit is @xmath89 .",
    "let us set @xmath89 , @xmath87 .",
    "the dispersion relation reads : @xmath90 so that @xmath91 as pointed out above , if @xmath92 there are no unstable modes . if @xmath93 only @xmath74 can be unstable and is , of course , the critical mode . if @xmath94 there are at least two modes which may become unstable and which of them is the critical mode depends on the quotient @xmath95 .",
    "hence , in general , @xmath74 is not the most unstable mode ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : grate_severalns_mu2zero ] and [ fig : grate_mu2zero ] ) .    in order to find a reduced equation for the weakly non - linear dynamics of @xmath1 we expand ( [ eq:1dmodelsigma ] ) keeping terms up to order @xmath96 : @xmath97 where we have made use of ( [ eq : slavinge ] ) . finding a reduced equation without an explicit dependence in @xmath79 seems difficult in this case .",
    "however , we can still obtain a useful reduced equation by simply taking ( [ eq : redequcollision ] ) and going back to the original variable @xmath1 and coordinates @xmath98 : @xmath99.\\ ] ]    the time - evolution predicted by this equation is compared to the original model in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolutionu0collision ] for @xmath100 .",
    "the dynamics is very sensitive to @xmath79 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : redeqcollisional ] ) ceases to describe it accurately for larger values of the expansion parameter .",
    "however , it is remarkable that even for values of @xmath79 of order @xmath101 , the stationary solutions of the reduced equation give good approximations of the exact ones ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : profilescollision ] , where @xmath102 ) .      in this section",
    "we take @xmath88 and @xmath103 . in this case @xmath104 and the critical point is given by @xmath105 as we already know , if @xmath92 there are no unstable modes . unlike the case of collisional drag , if @xmath73 the most unstable ( i.e. critical ) mode is always @xmath74 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : grate_mu1zero ] ) .",
    "in addition , for typical values of @xmath106 and @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and we can use the approximation @xmath109    we are now ready to derive a reduced equation for the dynamics of weakly unstable states in this case .",

    "[ fig : evolutionu0diff ] we show a comparison between the dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ eq : approxeqdiff ] ) and that of the original model , whereas figs .",
    "[ fig : bifurcationdiff ] and [ fig : profilesdiff ] are comparisons of the stationary solutions .",
    "a remark is in order at this point .",
    "a consequence of using the approximation ( [ eq : appcritpoint ] ) in eq . ( [ eq : redeqstep1 ] ) is that the linear growth rate is modified .",
    "an easy calculation shows that eq .",
    "( [ eq : approxeqdiff ] ) gives the actual linear growth rate ( at order @xmath114 ) only if we make the replacement @xmath115 which is natural , since the accuracy of our approximation depends on the quotient @xmath116 .",
    "thus , very close to the critical point one has to take into account the above correction of @xmath79 when comparing the results of ( [ eq : approxeqdiff ] ) with those coming from the integration of the exact equations of the model .    using that at the boundary , @xmath117 , and taking an initial condition such that @xmath118 , the stationary solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : approxeqdiff ] ) are exactly the solutions of : @xmath119 which is the time - independent ginzburg - landau equation for second - order phase transitions .",
    "it is the same equation as in the case of non - momentum - conserving reynolds stress with a collisional drag ( see ref .",
    "we follow the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain analytical expressions for the stationary solutions .",
    "the key observation is that there exists a ` conserved quantity ' .",
    "namely , @xmath120 this allows to reduce the solutions to quadratures : @xmath121 with @xmath122 . defining @xmath123 and performing the change of variable @xmath124 we can recast the solutions in the following form : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is an integration constant .",
    "hence , the solution for @xmath127 may be expressed as @xmath128 where @xmath129 stands for the jacobi elliptic function , which is periodic in @xmath130 .",
    "its period is @xmath131 , with @xmath132 the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . in order to write explicitly the solution in terms of the original variable @xmath1 and",
    "coordinate @xmath133 , recall that @xmath134 then , @xmath135 thus , the wavelength of the solutions is @xmath136    the boundary conditions determine the integration constants @xmath137 and @xmath126 .",
    "in particular , they imply the quantization condition @xmath138",
    "we have introduced a one - dimensional version of the phase transition model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite including a reynolds stress term with manifest momentum conservation .",
    "the model consists of three envelope equations for the fluctuation level @xmath0 , the poloidal shear flow @xmath1 and the density gradient @xmath2 .",
    "it possesses a critical point corresponding to a second order transition whose natural control parameter is @xmath3 , the particle flux . below the critical value , @xmath4 , the model has a non - trivial fixed point with @xmath5 . through a linear stability analysis",
    "we have shown that if @xmath6 the stationary solutions have non - zero shear flow and reduced turbulent fluctuations .",
    "we have also studied the dynamics of the model near ( and above ) the critical point . defining a suitable expansion around the critical point",
    "we have derived slaving conditions for @xmath0 and @xmath2 , so that they are determined from the value of @xmath1 .",
    "then , we have found reduced equations for the weakly non - linear dynamics of @xmath1 . in the case of diffusive shear flow damping the reduced equation is related to the ginzburg - landau equation , which allows us to work out analytical expressions for the stationay solutions of weakly unstable states .",
    "the analysis performed in this work shows some interesting differences with respect to previous one - dimensional versions of the model in which momentum conservation is not implemented ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the most relevant of them concerning the nature of the fixed points and the instabilities .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the most unstable mode is always @xmath55 , which is related to the fact that in the model studied therein there exist two ( non - trivial ) fixed points , one of them with @xmath5 and the other one with @xmath7 .",
    "the introduction of a momentum - conserving reynolds stress makes the fixed point with non - zero @xmath1 disappear , so that all stationary solutions with non - zero shear flow have non - trivial spatial structure .",
    "this is connected to the results derived in previous sections regarding the linear stability analysis of the critical point . in the model with momentum conservation",
    "@xmath55 is always stable and the discussion of the structure of the most unstable ( critical ) mode is more complicated . in general",
    ", the critical mode depends on the values of the parameters .",
    "the presence of non - zero critical mode is in agreement with the experimental findings reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a next step in the development of the model would be to incorporate the diamagnetic term in order to study the l to h transition . in the l - mode regime",
