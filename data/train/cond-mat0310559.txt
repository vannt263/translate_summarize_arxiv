    "the fluctuating barrier problem seems to be of relevance especially for the kinetics of biophysical systems @xcite whose time - evolution is governed by coupling to protein molecules undergoing constant conformational transitions . in particular , it is by now well established that membrane proteins that conduct many chemical and physical processes can exist in several conformational states whose distinct electrical properties may be responsible for the efficiency of ionic transport through biological channels . in such cases ,",
    "the assumption of random fluctuations in the membrane potential has been shown @xcite to be sufficient to explain experimental data on active ionic flow and resonance between internal fluctuations and external driving ac field .",
    "the enhancement or optimisation of the action of the external regular field by stochastic fluctuations gained the term _ stochastic resonance _",
    "( sr ) and became an issue of vivid experimental and theoretical studies @xcite over the past 20 years .",
    "although the sr phenomenon is commonly described as a cooperative effect in which small periodic influence entrains external random noise , similar constructive effects of noises under nonequilibrium constraints can be expected in `` ratchet '' systems @xcite where spatially uniform mean - zero symmetrical ( random or periodic ) time dependent forces interact with an underlying spatial anisotropy to induce motion . another resonant - type , noise - induced behaviour @xcite is resonant activation ( ra ) , the phenomenon in which an optimal fluctuation rate exists which minimizes the mean first passage time for the escape over the fluctuating barrier .",
    "the generic theoretical models analysing the aforementioned resonant phenomena are usually based on a langevin equation approach assuming the overdamped limit @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the influence of the external thermal bath of the surroundings on a brownian particle is described in such an equation by time - dependent random force which is commonly assumed to be represented by a white gaussian noise .",
    "that postulate is compatible with the assumption of a short correlation time of fluctuations , much shorter than the time - scale of the macroscopic motion and assumes that weak interactions with the bath lead to independent random variations of the parameter describing the motion . in more formal , mathematical terms gaussianity of the state - variable fluctuations is a consequence of the central limit theorem which states that normalized sum of independent and identically distributed ( _ i.i.d _ ) random variables with finite variance converges to the gaussian probability distribution . if , however , after random collisions jump lengths are ruled by broad distributions leading to the divergence of the second moment , the statistics of the process changes significantly .",
    "the existence of the limiting distribution is then guaranteed by the generalized lvy - gnedenko @xcite limit theorem . according to the latter , normalized sums of independent , identically distributed random variables with infinite variance",
    "converge in distribution to the lvy statistics . at the level of the langevin equation , lvy noises are generalization of the brownian motion and",
    "describe results of strong collisions between the test particle and the surrounding environment . in this sense , they lead to different models of the bath that go beyond a standard `` close - to - equilibrium '' gaussian description  @xcite .    in this communication",
    "we present numerical results for the mean first passage time over a fluctuating barrier for the model system with a linear potential subject to markovian dichotomous fluctuations and additive lvy noises .",
    "we report here on a new phenomenon of reappearance of ra in a model system whose pattern of the most efficient kinetics has been smeared out and destroyed by the presence of driving @xmath0-stable noise . in particular , we demonstrate that a congruent tuning of noise asymmetry with its stability index responsible for scaling properties of the noise increments can optimize the passage over the conformationally changing barrier .",
    "an overdamped brownian particle is moving in a potential field between absorbing ( @xmath1 ) and reflecting ( @xmath2 ) boundaries , in the presence of noise that modulates the barrier height .",
    "time evolution of a state variable @xmath3 is described in terms of the generalized langevin equation @xmath4 where prime means differentiation over @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a white lvy process originating from the contact with non - equilibrated bath and @xmath7 stands for a markovian dichotomous noise of intensity @xmath8 taking one of two possible values @xmath9 .",
    "autocorrelation of the dichotomous noise is set to @xmath10 . for simplicity , throughout the paper a particle mass , a friction coefficient and the boltzman constant are all set to 1 .",
    "the time - dependent potential @xmath11 is assumed to be linear with the barrier switching between two configurations with an average rate @xmath12 @xmath13 both @xmath14 and @xmath15 noises are assumed to be statistically independent .    the initial condition for eq .",
    "( [ lang ] ) is @xmath16 , so that initially particle is located at the reflecting boundary with equal choices of finding a potential barrier in any of two possible configurations @xmath17 .",
    "the quantity of interest is the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) , the average time which particle spends in the system before it becomes absorbed . in the approach",
    "applied herein information on the mfpt is drawn from the statistics of numerically generated trajectories satisfying the generalized langevin equation ( [ lang ] ) and the examined mfpt is estimated as a first moment of the distribution of first passage times ( fpt ) obtained from the ensemble of simulated realizations of the stochastic process in question .",
    "more precisely , frequency of fpt is calculated as frequency of the time - duration @xmath18 of the events ( trajectories ) that have initially started from @xmath2 and reached @xmath1 for the first time .",
    "the mfpt is estimated as @xmath19 over the frequency distribution . despite the fact that in eq .",
    "( [ lang ] ) @xmath5 itself is a random variable distributed according to some unknown stable distribution , the fpts are distributed according to some unknown probability distribution possessing all moments .",
    "generally , for systems driven by gaussian noises , noise - induced phenomena are studied solely in terms of @xmath20 , the intensity of the white noise @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic definition of this noise - source relates @xmath20 to the system temperature .",
    "it is not so , however , for dynamic systems perturbed by lvy stable noises , for which an appropriate choice of a control parameter is less obvious .",
    "it is caused by the fact that stable distributions are characterized by a four - parameter family : the stability index @xmath0 ( @xmath21 $ ] ) , skewness parameter @xmath22 ( @xmath23 $ ] ) , the shift @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and scaling @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) parameters , respectively ( for the definition of lvy measure , see appendix a ) .",
    "the pdfs of stable distributions demonstrate asymptotic power - law behaviour according to @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 controls the position of the pdf modal value , whereas @xmath26 , similarly to the gaussian case , scales the width of the distribution . at the first glance",
    ", the parameter @xmath26 is somehow connected to the system temperature , although the relation is more subtle since stable additive noises can be expected in nonequilibrium situations where the definition of temperature looses its common sense @xcite .    for the purpose of simulations the value of @xmath24 has been arbitrary set to 0 and @xmath29 .",
    "such a choice of @xmath24 and @xmath26 reconstructs standard normal distribution @xmath30 for @xmath31 , therefore allowing for comparison of the results obtained in this study with the former ones  @xcite , where the gaussian measures of the @xmath14 noise have been used . remaining parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath22 ) have taken values from the allowed range with a lower limit set up for the @xmath0 value ( @xmath32 have not been investigated ) .",

    "they correspond to the changing of the potential barrier between the barrier and the well ( @xmath37 ) , the barrier and `` no barrier '' ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) situations and to two barriers with different heights ( @xmath38 , @xmath40 ) .    in order to test the implemented numerical procedures ( cf .",

    "the fact that the shape of mfpt curve for very heavy - tailed , skewed distributions representing non - gaussian noises arising from the contact with not equilibrated bath is similar to the mfpt curve in the presence of the gaussian fluctuations arising from the contact with equilibrated thermal bath is very interesting and makes the problem of recognition of the underlying noise more complicated .",
