    "following the paper of castelnovo , moessner and sondhi  @xcite on emergent magnetic monopoles , there has been renewed interest in the properties of spin ice  @xcite .",
    "magnetic monopole currents were first envisaged by ryzhkin  @xcite while jaubert and holdsworth  @xcite studied the closely related problem of magnetic relaxation in spin ice by means of numerical simulations of the dipolar spin ice model  @xcite and of a dual monopole electrolyte .",
    "evidence for the characteristic non - ohmic conductivity signature of a weak monopole electrolyte - the wien effect - was reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the term ` magnetricity ' was coined .",
    "experimental evidence indicates that magnetic monopoles afford an economical description of spin ice at temperatures below @xmath3 k  @xcite . in particular , down to about 0.3 k",
    "the equilibrium specific heat is well described by debye - hckel theory  @xcite .",
    "however , to account in detail for the monopole currents and magnetic relaxation is generally a tricky problem , especially in the regime of slow dynamics at subkelvin temperatures , and this is an ongoing subject of investigation  @xcite .",
    "prior to the recent wave of interest , the spin dynamics of spin ice were studied in detail by matsuhira _",
    "et al . _",

    "previous studies of the spatial spin correlations by neutron scattering may be found , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the spin correlations in the spin ice state are characterised by two remarkable features  @xcite .",
    "the first is a property common to many ice - type models , that transverse magnetization ( or polarisation ) fluctuations are essentially unrestricted while longitudinal fluctuations are strongly suppressed at low temperature .",
    "this behaviour is captured in the phenomenological theory of youngblood and axe  @xcite ( formulated to describe ice rule ferroelectrics ) , in which the deconfined defects do not carry any coulombic charge .",
    "the second remarkable property , of course , is that in spin ice these defects do carry a magnetic coulomb charge  @xcite .",
    "however , they are also associated with a ` dirac string network ' of spin configurations , that while not pairing the monopoles , does restrict their motion to some extent  @xcite .",
    "any complete theory of spin ice needs to account for the difference between longitudinal and transverse correlations , the coulombic interactions of monopoles and the effect of the dirac string network .",
    "however , different experiments may pick out one or another of these three properties , so approximate models are useful .",
    "if monopoles are the focus then it is of most interest to discuss the longitudinal response as this is a highly sensitive measure of the spatial and temporal correlation of magnetic monopoles , as shown below .",
    "the simplest approach to treating the monopole correlations is a ` magnetolyte ' model of freely diffusing magnetic charges , in which the effect of dirac strings is subsumed into the transport coefficients , and electrolyte properties such as debye - hckel screening  @xcite , bjerrum pairing  @xcite and the wien effect  @xcite may be naturally formulated .",
    "another ( and earlier ) approach  @xcite accounts for the ignored spin degrees of freedom in the form of an effective reaction field , and this approach has recently been developed to include magnetic charge screening  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to calculate a generalised longitudinal susceptibility @xmath0 for magnetic monopoles in spin ice and to explore its application to experiment .",
    "the theory described here is only a modest extension of the earlier approaches of ryzhkin  @xcite and castelnovo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , but one that is necessary for the purpose of comparing theory with experiment .",
    "a useful by - product of this work is a clarification of the relationship between these two approaches , and their relation to that of youngblood and axe  @xcite .",
    "the equations discussed here are valid at temperatures that are sufficiently high to avoid the non equilibrium physics of the wien effect   for magnetic monopoles ( @xmath5 k for dy@xmath6ti@xmath6o@xmath7 )  @xcite , but not so high that high energy relaxation processes become important @xmath8 k for dy@xmath6ti@xmath6o@xmath7 )  @xcite .",
    "the results of the present paper are applicable to zero and weak applied field ( @xmath9 t )   t applied along the @xmath10 $ ] axis  @xcite has been given by shtyk and feigelman @xcite . ] .",
    "ryzhkin  @xcite explored the monopole dynamics of spin ice by applying the jaccard theory of water ice defects in the water ice - spin ice analogy .",
    "he showed that the magnetic current density @xmath11 is related to the rate of change of magnetization @xmath12 by the equation ( in our notation ) : @xmath13 and he derived the rate of entropy production associated with the flow of the magnetic charges : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is entropy and @xmath16 is magnetic field .",

    "[ ryzhkin ] contains much physics and is deserving of subtle appreciation .",
    "the term in @xmath16 represents the normal drift current of the charges @xmath25 in the applied field @xmath16 , and if there were only this term , then spin ice would be represented as a true conductor , precisely equivalent to an electrolyte .",
    "however the term in @xmath12 opposes the direct current and indeed extinguishes it completely at equilibrium , where @xmath26 .",
    "this reaction field does not originate in the magnetic monopoles themselves but rather in the configurational entropy of the monopole vacuum : magnetization of the system reduces that entropy and hence provides a thermodynamic force that opposes the current  @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that what stops the current in ryzhkin s formulation is not the sample boundaries : this is correct under the approximation that the system is homogenous and linear .",
    "if one further allows the competition of diffusion and drift to set up charge density gradients then the boundaries immediately become relevant and one must additionally consider boundary conditions that do not allow the passage of monopoles .",
    "however this is not necessary in the approximation considered .",
    "finally it should be emphasised that the extinction of the current implied by eqn .",
    "[ ryzhkin ] holds only for very small field and magnetization , for it is only in this limit that eqn .",

    "[ ryzhkin ] can also be integrated to predict the magnetic response to the sudden application or removal of a uniform field ( see section .",

    "ice the demagnetizing field arises from the magnetic pole density associated with uncompensated surface monopoles .",
    "as the spin ice sample is magnetized , an imbalance of magnetic charge develops at opposite surfaces as a result of the transient monopole current described by eqn .",
    "[ ryzhkin ] .",

    "we may write  @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath40 is the diamond lattice constant ( the numerical factor of 6 may be modified very slightly when the fact that a monopole may only hop in three out of four local directions is accounted for  @xcite ) . using the definitions @xmath49 where @xmath2 is the rare earth magnetic moment , and @xmath50 , eqns .",

    "we define the flux of positive and negative monopoles as @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "assuming there is no temperature gradient in the system , then the thermodynamic equations of motion are ( with @xmath57 ) : @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes a generalised thermodynamic force .",
    "if we assume that the monopole density is small , then following the theory of weak electrolytes we would expect the cross terms @xmath60 with @xmath61 to be zero .",
    "however the monopole motion should be strongly correlated in the sense that it always acts to maintain local charge neutrality : @xmath62 @xmath63 it is important to emphasise that this thermodynamic force is not the same as ryzhkin s reaction field which is a purely spin phenomenon peculiar to spin ice .",

    "the magnetic diffusion current is given by : @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "in the zero field equilibrium state the average local gradient of charge density is everywhere zero .",
    "the coulombic correlations create a diffusion force that tends to smooth the local longitudinal magnetization .",

    "if we apply a local field @xmath82 then this induces a longitudinal response @xmath68 .",

    "when these conditions are violated the build up of surface charge may have a decisive influence on the internal fields and on the magnetization process , and the preceding equations would need to be modified to account for this .",
    "we introduce the spatial and time dependent fourier transforms of the longitudinal magnetization and longitudinal magnetic field : @xmath94 @xmath95 and the generalised susceptibility ( assuming translational invariance ) : @xmath96 substituting these definitions into eqn .",

    "in contrast ( see section [ sec5 ] ) the transverse susceptibility of spin ice could take a paramagnetic value at equilibrium even in the complete absence of monopoles , as it does in the monopole - free spin ice ground state . in principle",
    "the transverse susceptibility could relax through the flipping of closed loops of spins  @xcite , though in reality it is more likely that it relaxes through the transient passage of magnetic monopoles .",
    "a more complete description of the wavevector dependence of the susceptibility is given in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the possibility of quantum mechanical effects giving rise to transverse dynamics distinct from magnetic monopoles ( so called ` photons ' ) has been discussed in refs .",

    "there is potentially a problem with eqn .",

    "since it seems implausible that @xmath103 would ever exceed @xmath34 ( and indeed @xmath34 should generally be less than it ) , then it appears that eqn .",

    "as discussed further below ( section [ neutron ] ) , it would seem more realistic to use this phenomenological equation than eqn .",

    "consider now the spin ice state in zero applied magnetic field , where the internal field @xmath82 , which originates from the magnetic monopoles , is no longer constrained but instead relaxes self consistently with the magnetization .",
    "an approximation to the problem is that close to equilibrium , the field takes the value @xmath110 everywhere , and that this relation is maintained for small fluctuations away from equilibrium .",
    "the internal field therefore costs spin entropy : @xmath111 and energy @xmath112 but this is offset by the energy gain in magnetizing the sample : @xmath113 summing these contributions and allowing the magnetic charge density to fluctuate along with the field we find a free energy functional for field fluctuations : @xmath114 this functional is entirely equivalent to that for electric field fluctuations in an electrolyte and in fact is equivalent to debye - hckel theory  @xcite .",
    "thus we see that by suppressing spin fluctuations ( i.e. setting @xmath110 ) we recover the debye - hckel approximation of castelnovo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite .    introducing the fourier transformed field @xmath115 and substituting into eqn .",
    "[ gfield ] we find : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the volume and we have used @xmath118 and the fact that the field , being derived from a scalar potential , is longitudinal to the wavevector . since the probability of a fluctuation is @xmath119 , we immediately see that the mean square amplitude of a mode is : @xmath120 the mean square field at a point is : @xmath121 the integral is dominated by short wavelength modes and the mean square field approximately takes the value : @xmath122",
    "using eqn . [ meansq ] , the mean square induction at a point is : @xmath123 obviously this equation depends on the induction being averaged over a sufficiently large volume that contains locally magnetized spins .",
    "if the point with which we are concerned experiences no local induction from the magnetized spins , and sees only a far field , then the mean square induction is simply @xmath124 recalling that @xmath125 where @xmath126 it may be shown that @xmath127 where @xmath128 and the symbol @xmath129 is used to indicate that factors of order unity are dropped . in the case",
    "that there is local induction arising from magnetized spins , this equation may be modified to : @xmath130    it is instructive to derive eqn . [ near ] in direct space . at a point in the sample",
    "the squared field may be averaged over contributions at distance @xmath131 weighted by the probability of finding a monopole at that distance : @xmath132 which neglects correlation between the field contributions .",
    "the fields are correlated over a distance of @xmath45 , but the average number of monopoles within a distance @xmath45 is typically of order unity , so correlation may be neglected to a first approximation .",
    "the field @xmath133 is approximately that due to a monopole or a spin at a distance @xmath40 .",
    "thus if a defect is viewed at a distance @xmath40 it looks like a spin , but if viewed at a much greater distance it looks like a monopole . for this reason monopoles",
    "are best detected by measuring their far fields  @xcite .",
    "the equivalent electrolyte theory has been formulated and worked out in detail by oosawa  @xcite , who found that the relaxation rate of a mode labelled by @xmath134 is : @xmath135 thus , short wavelength modes relax at a rate of @xmath34 , the monopole hop rate , and long wavelength modes relax at a rate @xmath136 , the monopole conductivity .",
    "fluctuations are important on all scales between the lattice constant and the debye length , so there is a dispersion of relaxation rates from the monopole hop rate @xmath34 to the bulk field relaxation rate , or monopole conductivity @xmath136 .    from eqn .",
    "[ mean ] , it may be seen that monopoles at distance @xmath40 and those at distance @xmath45 make similar contributions to the mean square field , while those at much greater distance may be neglected ( in zero applied field ) .",
    "monopoles at distance @xmath40 reverse the local field at a rate of approximately @xmath34 , whereas the cloud of monopoles at distance @xmath45 only reverses the field at the much slower rate @xmath136 , although it gives rise to small field fluctuations at a rate @xmath34 .",
    "comparison of eqn .",
    "[ rate1 ] with eqn .",
    "[ rate0 ] suggests that the field correlations relax at a rate @xmath136 while the spin correlations relax at a rate @xmath137 .",
    "although this difference may reflect the approximations made , it also seems plausible that the spin correlations relax more slowly than the field correlations at low temperature .",
    "thus the spin system can only relax by the passage of monopoles , so the time taken to find the most probable spin arrangement will generally be longer than the time taken to find the most probable monopole arrangement .",
    "it is obvious that the relaxation rate @xmath33 is equal to the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath138 but it is useful to see how this arises in detail .",
    "initial application of a magnetic field @xmath139 should result in almost instantaneous magnetization , in which energy is stored within the system of effective spins .",

    "@xmath142 determines the rate of exchange of heat @xmath143 with the thermal bath , and the consequent return of the spin system to thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath141 : @xmath144 we may also write : @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the heat capacity at constant field .",
    "hence we find : @xmath147 and the spin temperature relaxes at a rate @xmath148 .    to link this to the magnetization relaxation we use the thermodynamic relations @xmath149 and @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 is the heat capacity at constant magnetization .",
    "if then we apply a field @xmath153 and elicit a response @xmath154 the above two equations may be solved with the substitutions @xmath155 , @xmath156 ( eqn . [ alph ] ) and use of the thermodynamic relation @xmath157 .",

    "hence we will assume that the muon is at a site of zero local field , either within the sample or exterior to the sample , but near the surface .",
    "while the assumption of zero field sites within the spin ice sample gives a highly consistent description of experiment  @xcite , their existence has been contested on theoretical grounds  @xcite and the issue has been debated  @xcite .    at sufficiently high temperature ( t @xmath26310 k ) we might expect the tf-@xmath2sr dephasing rate @xmath264 to give a measure of @xmath265 , the spin - spin relaxation rate , which may be specified by a bpp type  @xcite expression : @xmath266 : @xmath267 where @xmath268 is approximately the spin flip rate and @xmath269 is the scale of the fluctuations of the field component parallel to the applied field . as the latter term tends to dominate , we shall only consider this term from now on .    in the spin ice regime , where @xmath270 is the dominating parameter of the system , the tf-@xmath2sr response is found to have a form that is unfamiliar in the context of @xmath2sr on paramagnets .",

    "the main conclusion of the present work is that magnetic monopoles in spin ice largely determine the longitudinal response of the system .",

    "the former effect should generally be considered when treating low temperature experimental data .    in general",
    "the theory discussed here works qualitatively well for real spin ice materials , capturing the temperature , wavevector and time dependence of a diverse range of experimental responses .",

    "third , the ac - susceptibility relaxation in the high temperature limit is more strongly dispersed  @xcite than predicted by the simple approximations discussed here .",
    "it seems very unlikely that the monopole theory will have to be abandoned to explain these discrepancies .",
