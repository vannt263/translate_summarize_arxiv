    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the three generation quark mixing is described by the unitary cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite .",
    "it governs all flavor transitions of quarks and @xmath9 symmetry violation due to a complex phase of it .",
    "precision determinations of the ckm matrix elements from weak decays of the relevant quarks provide powerful tests of the standard model .",
    "charm meson ( @xmath10 ) semileptonic decays allow the measurements of the ckm matrix elements @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the differential decay rate for exclusive semileptonic decays @xmath11 ( @xmath12 stands for a pseudoscalar meson ) with the electron mass neglected can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath15 is the four - momentum transfer squared between the parent @xmath16 meson and the final state meson , @xmath17 is the momentum of the pseudoscalar meson in the @xmath16 rest frame , and @xmath18 is the relevant ckm matrix element , either @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath19 is the form factor that measures the probability that the flavor changed quark ( @xmath20 ) from @xmath21 transitions and the spectator anti - quark ( @xmath22 ) will form a meson in the final state .    to determine @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we need theoretical input of the absolute normalization of the form factor describing the decay at a fixed @xmath15 point , usually at @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath16 semileptonic decays can also offer tests of the theoretical predictions of the form factors .",
    "since the charm meson semileptonic decay form factors are closely related to those of @xmath24 meson semileptonic decays by heavy quark symmetry , precise knowledge of the charm semileptonic form factors will in turn help improve the determination of the ckm matrix element @xmath25 .",
    "the data sample of 60 pb@xmath0 used for this analysis was collected at the @xmath1 resonance with the cleo - c detector  @xcite at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) . in this analysis , we take advantage of the unique kinematics of the @xmath26 threshold production at the @xmath1 resonance which provides very powerful means to reject backgrounds from misidentified and missing particles .",
    "we fully reconstruct one @xmath2 meson of the produced @xmath27 pairs as a tag .",
    "we identify an electron and a set of hadrons recoiling against the tag , reconstructing the missing momentum and missing energy .",
    "the difference between the missing energy and missing momentum in a event",
    "@xmath28 will peak at zero if the event is correctly reconstructed due to the undetected neutrino .",
    "we select events with a fully reconstructed @xmath2 meson where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "charge conjugate decays are implied throughout this paper . within the tagged events , we select the subset in which the @xmath38 meson semileptonically decays to a specific final state .",
    "the efficieny - corrected ratio of the event yields gives the absolute branching fraction for the exclusive semileptonic decay mode .",
    "the selection of the tag @xmath2 candidates is based on two variables @xmath39 ( the difference between the energy of the tag @xmath2 candidate ( @xmath40 ) and the beam energy ( @xmath41 ) ) , and the beam constrained mass @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the momentum of the tag @xmath2 candidate .",
    "we use rich and @xmath44 information to identify kaons and pions . in fig .",
    "[ d0tag ] , we present the fits to the beam constrained masses of different tag modes .",
    "multiple combinations have been eliminated by selecting the candidate with the minimum value of @xmath45 .",
    "we have found about 60,000 tag @xmath2 .",
    "we find @xmath2 semileptonic decays into @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) against a tag @xmath2 by reconstructing the difference of the missing energy and missing momentum which should peak at zero . in fig .",
    "[ datamc ] , we present the comparision for the selected @xmath2 semileptonic decay events between data and mc , the comparison shows good agreement .",
    "the fits to the @xmath28 distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ semi ] , and the yields are given in table  [ summary ] .",
    "the detail of event selection can be found in ref .",
    "the measured absolute branching fractions are given in table  [ summary ] , in comparison with the pdg values  @xcite .",
    "all results are preliminary .",
    "the errors are statistical and systematic , respectively .",
    "the dominant systematic error comes from uncertainties of track and @xmath49 reconstruction efficiency ( 3% per track and 4.4% per @xmath49 ) which will improve with more data sample and further study .",
    "based on a data sample of 60 pb@xmath0 collected at the @xmath1 resonance , we have improved the absolute measurements of @xmath2 semileptonic decay branching fractions and presented the first observation of @xmath50 .",
    "our results for @xmath51 and @xmath52 are consistent with those from the pdg .",
    "our result @xmath53 is lower than the pdg value .",
    "the ratio @xmath54 is close to the cleo iii result @xmath55  @xcite , while lower than the pdg value .",
    "[ summary ]    in the near future , we expect to provide precision measurements of the absolute branching fractions for @xmath16 semileptonic decays at a precision of 2% .",
    "while the normalizations of form factors @xmath56 determined from lattice qcd  @xcite have 10% uncertainties . to determine @xmath7 and @xmath8 precisely , more precision lattice qcd results are essential in the near future .",
    "we have improved the absolute branching fractions for exclusive @xmath2 semileptonic decays .",
    "we expect more precise measurements of the absolute branching fractions for exclusive @xmath2 semileptonic decays in the near future , and therefore precision determinations of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
