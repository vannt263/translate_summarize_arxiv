    "* the fact that electron flips its spin as it travels between the electrodes constitutes an additional source of shot noise@xcite and , thus , affects the fano factor .",
    "the above calculation of @xmath19 is insufficient to find the fano factor of `` two - site '' transport with spin flip .",
    "the reason for this is that the transport of charge is incoherent while the spin - transport is fully coherent .",
    "qualitatively , the complexity of description of noise follows from the fact that the fano factor must depend on _ both _ @xmath19 and the magnetizations @xmath252 of the electrodes .",
    "the latter conclusion can be inferred from the reasoning presented in ref . .",
    "suppose that magnetizations of the electrodes are anti - parallel , and @xmath19 is small .",
    "then , no matter what is the actual mechanism of transport , the fano factor should be @xmath12 , which is the poissonian value .",
    "this is because , in order to be transferred between the electrodes , electron must flip the spin . for small @xmath19",
    "it is waiting time for the spin - flip which is the bottle - neck for transport , since it is much longer than the waiting time for all hops .",
    "all we can say is that , if one electrode changes from oppositely polarized to non - polarized , the fano factor changes from @xmath12 to @xmath253 , which is the fano factor for _ spin - independent _ transport through the same sites .",
    "rigorous evaluation of the fano factor with magnetization of electrodes taken into account , requires solving the equation for time evolution of the full density matrix .",
    "* as was mentioned in the introduction , in diffusive transport , spin - memory loss is incorporated via the `` survival '' probability , @xmath254 which we replaced by @xmath255 .",

    "the current between the electrodes can be viewed as a sequence of cycles @xmath263 where @xmath264 is a random waiting time for the next electron to be transferred between @xmath24 and @xmath11 .",
    "suppose now that the left electrode is polarized @xmath20 , while the right electrode is polarized @xmath22 .",
    "then the electron transfer requires a spin - flip , and eq .",
    "( [ nospin ] ) should be modified as @xmath265 where @xmath266 is a quantum - mechanical probability that after a composite process with duration @xmath267 the electron flips its spin .",
    "for the situation considered in this paper the composite process is an inelastic two - hop tunneling . to calculate",
    "the average current one should take the limit of large @xmath267 and average over the compound waiting times , @xmath264 , with distribution function @xmath268 .",

    "( [ withspin ] ) turns into a geometrical progression , the summation of which yields @xmath270 in the limit @xmath271 one can set @xmath272 in the numerator and expand the denominator to the lowest order .",
