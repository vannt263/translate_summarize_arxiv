    "a landmark in the description of the coupled motion of electrons and nuclei in molecular systems was the seminal paper by born and oppenheimer  @xcite .",
    "in the so - called born - oppenheimer ( bo ) method the time - independent schrdinger equation is solved by expanding in orders of the electron - nuclear mass ratio .",
    "the lowest order equation corresponds to solving the electronic problem for fixed nuclei , while higher orders allow to consider nuclear vibrations , rotations and their coupling to the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "what is nowadays usually referred to as the bo approximation ( boa ) is the combined solution of ( i ) the electronic eigenvalue problem at fixed nuclear positions , i.e. the lowest order of the bo time - independent expansion , and ( ii ) the nuclear time-(in)dependent schrdinger equation , where the potential is provided by a single eigenvalue of the electronic hamiltonian , the so - called bo hamiltonian , at each nuclear position  . in the time - dependent version of the boa ,",
    "the electronic and nuclear equations are derived from the full schrdinger equation as consequence of an approximation , based on the adiabatic hypothesis : it assumes that the electrons react instantaneously to the motion of the nuclei .",
    "therefore , they `` statically '' occupy an eigenstate corresponding to a given configuration of the nuclei .",
    "the boa is the cornerstone of molecular dynamics , because it allows to simulate a variety of complex molecular time - dependent phenomena efficiently and accurately .",
    "however , even in those situations where it conveys an overall correct description of the problem , a treatment based on the boa is not free of inconsistencies .",
    "a few examples have been reported in the literature : the electronic mass is not properly accounted for in the dynamics of the nuclei  @xcite , which can lead to inaccuracies when calculating vibrational and rotational excitation energies of light molecules  @xcite ; in the absence of degeneracies and external magnetic fields , the electronic state computed within the boa is real . as a consequence , the electronic current density vanishes and the continuity equation is violated  @xcite . for similar reasons , the vibrational circular dichroism computed within",
    "the boa requires corrections  @xcite to yield agreement with experimental measurements .",
    "various approaches  @xcite have been proposed to cure these inconsistencies perturbatively . in this paper",
    "we further develop this idea by focusing on the following questions : is there a procedure to systematically identify corrections to the boa ? can a `` small '' parameter be identified that justifies that treatment of such corrections as perturbation ? what physical quantities are affected by the corrections ?",
    "the starting point of the analysis is the exact factorization ( xf ) of the electron - nuclear wave function  @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) is written as a single product of a nuclear wave function and an electronic factor with parametric dependence on the nuclear configuration .",
    "the full tdse splits into two coupled equations for the nuclear and for the electronic components .",
    "such factorization of the molecular wave function is exact , thus it incorporates non - adiabatic effects arising from the coupling between electronic and nuclear motion .",
    "the form of the electron - nuclear wave function in the xf framework looks deceptively similar to the electron - nuclear wave function in the boa .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask under which conditions the boa is recovered from the xf .",
    "we will show that boa emerges from the xf in the _ adiabatic limit _",
    "@xcite , i.e. , when the electron - nuclear mass ratio tends to zero .",
    "strong indications that this is indeed the correct limiting procedure to recover the boa from the xf have been reported in a recent numerical study  @xcite , where it was shown that characteristic features of the boa , related to molecular geometric phases , only appear in the limit of infinite nuclear masses in the xf , except if one chooses current - carrying eigenstates in systems with degeneracies  @xcite .    in the framework provided by the xf ,",
    "the nuclear equation is a tdse , where a time - dependent vector potential ( tdvp ) and a time - dependent scalar potential , also referred to as time - dependent potential energy surface ( tdpes ) , mediate the coupling to the electrons .",
    "the electronic equation is a less standard evolution equation , where an electron - nuclear coupling operator ( enco ) , which acts on the parametric dependence of the electronic factor , is responsible for inducing non - adiabatic transitions .",
    "the nuclear equation describes how the nuclei evolve , while the electronic equation describes how the electrons follow the nuclear motion .",
    "this is consequence of choosing the product form of the full wave function as a _ proper _ nuclear wave function and a _ conditional _ electronic wave function , similarly to what is done within the boa .",
    "this way of decomposing the electron - nuclear problem provides the same perspective as the boa . in the electronic equation ,",
    "when the enco vanishes , the explicit coupling to the nuclear motion vanishes as well .",
    "therefore , the exact electronic equation is expected to yield the eigenvalue problem associated to the bo hamiltonian at fixed nuclear configuration .",
    "we will show that this situation is formally recovered in the adiabatic limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] , we briefly recall the xf and compare it to the boa . in section  [ sec : units ] , we introduce the unit system used to analyze the dependence on the electron - nuclear mass ratio of the equations of the xf .",
    "we analyze this dependence in the electronic equation in section  [ sec : electronic equation ] and in the nuclear equation in section  [ sec : nuclear equation ] .",
    "the theoretical discussion is supported by numerical results , presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "conclusions are stated in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the xf has been presented  @xcite and extensively discussed  @xcite in previous work .",
    "therefore , we only introduce here the basic formalism and we refer to the above references for a detailed presentation .",
    "a system of interacting electrons and nuclei , in the absence of external fields , is described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the nuclear kinetic energy and @xmath2 is the bo hamiltonian , containing the electronic kinetic energy and all interactions .",
    "the evolution of the electron - nuclear wave function , @xmath3 , is described by the tdse @xmath4 . in the xf framework the solution of this tdse is written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the nuclear wave function and @xmath7 is an electronic factor parametrically depending on the nuclear configuration @xmath8 . here , the symbols @xmath9 have been used to collectively indicate the positions of @xmath10 electrons and @xmath11 nuclei , respectively .",
    "@xmath7 satisfies the partial normalization condition @xmath12 which makes the factorization in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : factorization ] ) unique up to a gauge - like phase transformation .",
    "starting from the tdse for the full wave function and using frenkel s action principle  @xcite , where the partial normalization condition is imposed by means of lagrange multipliers  @xcite , the evolution equations for @xmath7 and @xmath6 are    [ eqn : exact eqn ] @xmath13-\\epsilon({\\mathbf r},t)\\right ] \\phi_{{\\mathbf r}}({\\mathbf r},t)&=i\\hbar\\partial_t\\phi_{{\\mathbf r}}({\\mathbf r},t)\\label{eqn : exact electronic eqn}\\\\ \\left[\\sum_{\\nu=1}^{n_n}\\frac{\\left[-i\\hbar\\nabla_\\nu+\\ba_\\nu({\\mathbf r},t)\\right]^2}{2m_\\nu}+\\epsilon({\\mathbf r},t)\\right]\\chi({\\mathbf r},t)&=i\\hbar\\partial_t\\chi({\\mathbf r},t).\\label{eqn : exact nuclear eqn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that @xmath6 fulfills a standard tdse .",
    "the evolution of the electronic factor @xmath7 , however , is governed by a less common equation .",
    "in fact , the difference to a tdse is the presence of the so - called electron - nuclear coupling operator ( enco ) , @xmath14=&\\sum_{\\nu=1}^{n_n}\\frac{1}{m_\\nu}\\left[\\frac{\\left[-i\\hbar\\nabla_\\nu-\\ba_\\nu({\\mathbf r},t)\\right]^2}{2}+\\right.\\\\ & \\left.\\left(\\frac{-i\\hbar\\nabla_\\nu\\chi({\\mathbf r},t)}{\\chi({\\mathbf r},t)}+\\ba_\\nu({\\mathbf r},t)\\right)\\left(-i\\hbar\\nabla_\\nu-\\ba_\\nu({\\mathbf r},t)\\right)\\right],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which acts on the parametric dependence on the nuclear positions .",
    "since the enco depends on the nuclear wave function it describes _ dynamical _ effects of the nuclei on the electrons .",
    "the time - dependent vector potential ( tdvp ) , @xmath15 and the time - dependent potential energy surface ( tdpes ) , @xmath16 mediate the _ exact _ coupling between the two subsystems , thus they include all effects beyond the boa on the nuclear dynamics . in the above equations the symbol @xmath17 has been used to indicate integration over the electronic coordinates .",
    "the tdvp and the tdpes transform  @xcite as standard gauge potentials , i.e. @xmath18 when the electronic and nuclear wave functions transform as @xmath19 with a gauge - like phase @xmath20 which is a real function of only nuclear positions and time .",
    "this gauge - like freedom is the only freedom in the definition of the electronic and nuclear wave functions , that can be removed by fixing the gauge .",
    "the equations driving the evolution of the coupled electron - nuclear system within the boa are formally similar to the exact equations  ( [ eqn : exact eqn ] )  -  ( [ eqn : tdpes ] ) . in order to show this relation , we write the bo wave function as @xmath21 note that @xmath22 is an approximation to the exact solution @xmath23 of the tdse . in the boa ,",

    "@xmath25\\varphi_{{\\mathbf r}}^{\\mathrm{bo}}({\\mathbf r } ) = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the @xmath8-dependent eigenvalue @xmath26 .",

    "however , for a real electronic state @xmath24 , @xmath29 identically vanishes , and @xmath31 contains the diagonal correction to the bo energy  @xcite .",
    "these corrections to the bo energy , being @xmath32 , are often neglected .",
    "the purpose of the following sections is to describe how equations  ( [ eqn : bo electronic eqn ] ) and  ( [ eqn : bo nuclear eqn ] ) are recovered from equation  ( [ eqn : exact eqn ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) is @xmath33 where the first two terms on the right - hand - side are the nuclear and electronic kinetic energy operators , respectively , followed by the electron - nuclear , purely electronic and purely nuclear coulomb interactions . as in sec .",

    "all other units can be derived starting from the basic ones chosen above .",

    "our particular choice of units leads to two interesting results .",
    "first , the speed of light is scaled with @xmath55 , thus if @xmath56 , i.e. , if the nuclei become infinitely massive compared to the electrons , @xmath57 tends to infinity .",
    "second , planck s constant is the square root of the electron - nuclear mass ratio , thus if @xmath56 also @xmath58 becomes zero .",
    "we will refer to the limit @xmath59 as the `` adiabatic limit '' . since @xmath60 is a dimensionless mass ratio",

    "this outcome is indeed intuitively expected , since we expect that in the limit of nuclei that are much heavier than the electrons the nuclear kinetic energy becomes irrelevant .",
    "we point out that hamiltonian ( [ eqn : general hamiltonian ] ) has the same form in standard atomic units .",
    "the crucial difference in using units ( [ eqn : fundamental units ] ) appears when we look at the tdse .",

    "it is the sum of three contributions , i.e. , @xmath72 the bo term , the bbo ( beyond bo ) term and the td ( time derivative ) term , where @xmath73 only contains the first term on the right - hand - side of eq .",

    "as anticipated above , this dependence also appears in the term containing the time derivative of the electronic factor .",
    "when the adiabatic limit is approached as @xmath56 , this term vanishes as the square root of the mass ratio : we recover the boa for the coupled electron - nuclear dynamics , the electronic state is static , in the sense that the electronic system is always found in the same eigenstate ( solution of the eigenvalue problem associated to @xmath2 ) .",
    "the alert reader may have noticed that the enco [ cf .",
    "( [ eqn : enco in prime units ] ) ] contains a sum over all nuclei .",
    "each term contains a prefactor @xmath76 , i.e. , the ratio of the dimensionless electron mass @xmath60 and the dimensionless nuclear mass @xmath77 .",
    "so far we have implicitly assumed that all the @xmath77 are of order one , which means that the molecule is comprised of nuclei with similar masses .",
    "if , however , the molecule contains nuclei which are much lighter than the average nuclear mass , e.g. , if the molecule contains hydrogen , the corresponding @xmath77 might not be of order one but instead @xmath78 . note",
    "that this is not in conflict with our general discussion , for it simply means that the adiabatic limit may not be suited to describe the present system .    in the adiabatic limit",
    ", the time dependence is solely carried by the nuclear wave function , which evolves according to a tdse where the potential is given by the bo energy eigenvalue at each nuclear position , as will be argued in sec .",
    "[ sec : nuclear equation ] .",
    "this result depends on the viewpoint adopted in the xf , as we have already mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the coupled equations in fact describe how the nuclei move and how the electrons follow their motion , thus the explicit time dependence of the electronic factor only arises as effect of the coupling to the nuclei . if the nuclear mass increases , then nuclear motion becomes slower and define a time scale over which the electrons are able to react instantaneously .",
    "this is the reason why the xf equations lead to the boa in the adiabatic limit . in the time - dependent version of boa ,",
    "the electronic and nuclear systems are not treated on equal footing : the electronic equation is static , whereas the nuclear equation is an evolution equation .",
    "the electronic equation is an eigenvalue problem , satisfied only by the eigenstate of @xmath79 with eigenvalue @xmath80 ( see the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : el eqn in new units with td ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , at all times during the evolution of the nuclear wave function ( and also at the initial time ) , the electronic state must be an eigenstate of the bo hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : el eqn in new units with td ] ) the term responsible for the coupling with the nuclear motion , @xmath81 , is eliminated as the mass ratio goes to zero . clearly , non - adiabatic effects disappear in the adiabatic limit .",

    "this is somehow unexpected , as the explicit dependence on time of the electronic state arises as consequence of the coupling to nuclear motion , which is encoded in the enco .",
    "however , it has to be borne in mind that so far we have only analyzed the explicit dependence on @xmath60 in the evolution equation for the electrons .",
    "at this point we have only established that in the limit @xmath59 the electronic equation reduces to the static boa for the electronic factor under the assumption that the @xmath59 limit of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nabla chi over chi in new units ] ) does not diverge as @xmath55 or stronger .",
    "we investigate this issue in sec .",
    "[ sec : nuclear equation ] .",
    "let us suppose that the nuclear wave function is a coherent state , with gaussian - shape density and propagating with a certain momentum .",
    "then , as the adiabatic limit is approached , one would intuitively expect that the density localizes and that the motion becomes slower  @xcite .",
    "this effect can be understood classically as consequence of the increase of the nuclear mass .",
    "therefore , in the analysis reported below , we will also take into account the dependence of the nuclear wave function on the mass ratio .",
    "we consider explicitly this dependence here , since only the nuclear term in the factorization  ( [ eqn : factorization ] ) is a proper nuclear wave function ; the electronic factor has simply a parametric `` conditional '' dependence on @xmath8 , which we assume not being affected by the nuclear mass .    in order to motivate this assumption",
    "let us consider the probabilities @xmath86 and @xmath87 , rather than the probability amplitudes .",
    "it is natural to expect that a massive nucleus yields a density which is very localized in space , associated to a large marginal probability , @xmath86 , in certain regions of space . as the nuclear mass decreases , the value of the probability decreases as well , consequence of the delocalization of a light particle ( and of the normalization of the probability ) . at the same time",
    ", @xmath87 is a conditional probability , providing the probability of finding the electronic configuration @xmath88 at time @xmath89 , _ given that _",
    "the nuclei are in the configuration @xmath8 . such condition , translated to the language of quantum mechanics , could be expressed as a nuclear probability density in the form of a @xmath90-function centered at @xmath91 , as the @xmath90-function yields the certainty of finding the nuclear configuration @xmath91 at time @xmath89 . in this sense , it seems that the conditional probability can be defined without explicit knowledge of the marginal probability @xmath92 .",
    "however , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and the associated probabilities , are intimately related via the schrdinger equation and the fact that they yield the full wave function . keeping this relation in mind",
    ", we will still consider that the parametric dependence of the conditional wave function is not affected by the adiabatic limit , leaving open the possibilities for further investigations in this direction .",
    "in the same spirit as what has been presented above , we analyze the nuclear equation  ( [ eqn : exact nuclear eqn ] ) . to this end",
    "it is necessary to extract the dependence on @xmath60 of the quantities appearing in the equation . remembering that we have chosen the gauge such that @xmath95 we obtain @xmath96 ^ 2}{2m_\\nu ' } + \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{bo}}'({\\mathbf r}',t')+\\mu\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{bbo}}'({\\mathbf r}',t')\\right]\\chi'({\\mathbf r}',t')&=i\\sqrt{\\mu}\\partial_{t'}\\chi'({\\mathbf r}',t')\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that eq .",

    "this means that for heteronuclear molecules the validity of the adiabatic description has to be critically examined .",

    "we will prove numerically that the theoretical development discussed in the present work applies to all situations .",
    "the bo pess , along with the non - adiabatic coupling vector ( nacv ) @xmath138 between the ground @xmath139 and first excited @xmath140 ( real ) adiabatic states , are shown in fig .",

    "different values of the nuclear mass have been chosen , such that @xmath147 500 , 1000 , 2000 , 5000 , 10000 .",
    "the simulations are performed by fixing the energy of the systems with different mass ratios such that all differences in the dynamics can be solely attributed to the difference in @xmath60 . with this idea in mind , we have constructed a set of initial conditions with the same total energy for all values of @xmath60 .",

    "the contributions to the kinetic energy due to the spread of the gaussian , i.e. , @xmath149 expressed in the unit system  ( [ eqn : fundamental units ] ) , for different @xmath60 are determined as follows : given @xmath150 0.15  a@xmath131 ( this is an arbitrary choice , made simply for numerical convenience ) for @xmath151 2000 , all other values of the variance are selected according to @xmath152 .",

    "the initial nuclear densities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bo ] for all values of the mass ratio and are all the same in the three cases studied here .",
    "the part concerning the potential energy is more complicated , because quantum mechanically it depends on the particular shape of the ground state potential and on the spreading of the nuclear density .",
    "however , the more the nuclear density localizes at @xmath153 , the more the potential energy only depends on @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , the total ( conserved ) energy of the system results to be @xmath154 for the strong coupling case , @xmath155 for the intermediate coupling case , and @xmath156 for the weak coupling case , for all values of the mass ratio .",
    "the split - operator - technique  @xcite is used to solve the tdse for @xmath157 .",

    "the final values of the populations of the ground state are reported in table  [ tab : populations ] for all coupling strengths and for all values of @xmath158 .",

    "this rule follows from the dependence of the time variable on the mass ratio , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dt new units ] ) .",
    "we obtain that as the nuclear mass increases also the time - step , and therefore the length of the simulation , increases .",
    "figure  [ fig : final steps ] shows for @xmath147 500 , 2000 , 10000 that indeed the nuclear densities reach the same positions after the same number of integration time - steps .",
    "500 ( green lines ) , 2000 ( blue lines ) and 10000 ( magenta lines ) at the final time - step .",
    "the figure shows that the densities are indeed different for different values of the mass ratio but they are all located in the same region .",
    "this follows from the fact that the integration time - steps have been scaled with the mass ratio as discussed in the text . ]      in the situations described above , we have computed the average nuclear momentum for the different values of the electron - nuclear mass ratio . the leading term that in the expression of the enco induces non - adiabatic effects on electronic dynamics , i.e. @xmath162 , can be interpreted classically as the nuclear momentum .",
    "the order of this leading term has been shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nuclear momentum ] ) to be @xmath55 , when the unit system defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : units ] is introduced .",
    "therefore , we have identified an observable , the average nuclear momentum , to be used as an indicator of the validity of this observation .",
    "we expect that the nuclear momentum is a linear function of @xmath55 .",
    "first of all , let us show the average nuclear momentum computed along the dynamics in the three non - adiabatic situations and for all values of @xmath158 .",
    "the momentum is plotted as function of the integration time - steps .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : momentum ] that , according to the discussion presented in sec .  [ sec : details ] , the behavior of the nuclear momentum is the same for all values of the mass ratio , but indeed the absolute values are different .",
    "it is such difference that we will investigate further , because it can be uniquely ascribed to the difference in the nuclear masses .",
    "is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : bo ] .",
    "the arrows in the middle panel , labeled by @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , indicate the time - steps that have been selected for the analysis shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - dependence ] . ]    , namely @xmath163 ( green dots ) , @xmath164 ( red dots ) and @xmath165 ( blue dots ) , the values of the average nuclear momentum is plotted as function of @xmath55 .",
    "the dashed black lines are the results of the linear fit . ]    to this end , we select three time - steps , that are indicated by the arrows in the middle panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : momentum ] . at those time - steps ,",
    "we plot the values of the momentum as function of @xmath55 in fig .  [ fig : mu - dependence ] .",
    "the dependence on the inverse of the square root of the mass ratio is clearly linear , as predicted by the analysis discussed in this work .",
    "we have developed a procedure that shows how the boa is recovered from the xf in the limit of infinite nuclear mass , @xmath166 , the adiabatic limit .",
    "the adiabatic hypothesis is based on the assumption that the coupled electron - nuclear motion can be split by solving first the electronic problem at a fixed nuclear geometry , and then the nuclear problem where the potential is the eigenvalue of the electronic hamiltonian for that geometry .",
    "the xf provides equations of motion for the electronic and nuclear wave functions , thus we have been able to analyze separately the dependence of the two equations on @xmath60 and to show that indeed all terms inducing an explicit coupling between electronic and nuclear motion disappear in the adiabatic limit .",
    "therefore , we have formally and in general shown what has been already observed numerically  @xcite in a particular case , namely that the xf contains features of the boa in the infinite nuclear mass limit .",
    "non - adiabatic , or beyond bo , effects appear at different orders in @xmath167 .",
    "the leading terms only affect electronic dynamics , but do not contribute to the potential that is used in the nuclear equation .",
    "such terms depend explicitly on the nuclear wave function , and the dependence can be approximated as the ( classical ) nuclear momentum .",
    "therefore , we have justified in a rigorous way that in the limit of small , but finite , @xmath60 , non - adiabatic effects can be treated perturbatively , an idea that has been already employed to correct vibrational spectra  @xcite and to compute electronic current densities  @xcite beyond the boa . in these cases , only the lowest order term , i.e. , @xmath113 , in the electronic equation has been considered , exactly in the form derived here , while the nuclear problem is treated within the adiabatic approximation . the perturbed electronic hamiltonian induces in this way corrections to electronic wave function that are purely imaginary .",
    "this property is essential to obtain an electronic state sustaining a current  @xcite and yielding a non - vanishing tdvp  @xcite . in turn , the tdvp has been expressed  @xcite as an electronic mass contribution in the nuclear hamiltonian , up to within the lowest order in the perturbation .",
    "furthermore , we have observed that the coefficients appearing in the expansion in powers of @xmath65 depend on the nuclear masses .",
    "as those nuclear masses , @xmath168 , are unit - less quantities , they can be used to estimate the importance of the corresponding nuclei for such coefficients , and thereby partition the beyond bo effects among different nuclei .",
    "this observation deserves further investigation as it may prove useful to quantify the role of light nuclei in non - adiabatic corrections .",
    "we have presented an analytical derivation of the adiabatic limit and supported some of the observations with a numerical analysis . in particular , we have tested the dependence on @xmath65 of the leading order correction in the electronic equation , related to the nuclear momentum .",
    "in conclusion we have established that the framework of the exact factorization of the electron - nuclear wave function reduces to the static born - oppenheimer approximation for the electronic wave function in the limit of vanishing electron - nuclear mass ratio .",
    "moreover , we have shown that in the same limit the nuclear equation reduces to the classical limit of the time - dependent schdinger equation with the born - oppenheimer potential energy surface entering as potential for the classical nuclei .",
    "going beyond the adiabatic limit in both equations the leading order corrections enter with the square root of the electron - nuclear mass ratio .",
