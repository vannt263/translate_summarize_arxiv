    "in the seminal paper  @xcite gravity lives in five - dimensional anti  de - sitter ( @xmath0 ) spacetime , infinite but strongly curved . due to the presence of one graviton bound state , related to the finite proper size of  bulk \" spacetime",

    "this mechanism however works only on codimension  1 branes but could be indirectly generalized  @xcite by placing @xmath1 codimension  1 branes intersecting in one 3-brane ( our world ) .",
    "the brane tension of each of these 4-branes localizes gravity in the respective dimension .",
    "models have been built and their cosmological consequences analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "this geometric setup has also been used to address the cosmological constant .",
    "static embeddings of 3-branes in @xmath0 spacetimes were found  @xcite where the induced metric is ds , minkowski or ads ; the curvature of the brane could be made much smaller than the brane tension .",
    "the same solution , now for a 4-brane in 6  dimensions , was rediscovered in conformally flat form in  @xcite .",
    "it was observed in this paper that it is possible to embed a static 4-brane , plane in conformal coordinates , at any angle @xmath2 determined by the brane tension , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a critical value for the brane tension . a vanishing observed cosmological constant ( i.e. flat induced metric )",
    "is produced when @xmath5 .",
    "cutting out wedges of the bulk @xmath0 with some angle @xmath2 and pasting together @xmath6 copies can accommodate an excess angle @xmath7 .",
    "this must match the 3-brane vacuum energy in the intersection .",
    "the wedges are stabilized by imposing orbifold boundary conditions on each 4-brane .",
    "whereas in the original randall - sundrum models  @xcite the 3-brane tension is fine tuned to the bulk cosmological constant , here it must be fine tuned to match the excess angle , a function of the 4-brane tensions .",
    "a similar setup with different bulk cosmological constants in each wedge is considered in  @xcite , although without the introduction of an excess angle and correspondingly , without a 3-brane tension .",
    "it has been speculated in this reference that an additional parameter of the solution could resolve the one remaining fine tuning .",
    "what we need is a flat direction ; then a new dynamical mechanism could stabilize the cosmological constant at zero value .",
    "any additional vacuum energy would result in the readjustment of the brane angles and the additional parameter .    in this paper",
    "we find such an additional parameter .",
    "using gaussian normal coordinates ( gnc ) of a 4-brane , we write down all vacuum solutions in the bulk ( with a negative cosmological constant ) , satisfying the ansatz with signature @xmath8 @xmath9 the 4-brane is located at @xmath10 .",
    "the stability of the brane with orbifold boundary conditions ( i.e. @xmath11 identified while @xmath12 are fixed ) comes down to the israel conditions  @xcite on the extrinsic curvature , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the 4-brane tension in appropriate units ( @xmath15 is the extrinsic curvature of the brane ) .",
    "there is considerable freedom in transforming the coordinates , still within the ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz ] ) .",
    "in addition , the same bulk metric is found starting with brane with different tensions , embedded at various angles . after eliminating all these ambiguities",
    "we are left with four different solutions ( in each case the @xmath16 coordinate is chosen to render the induced metric conformally flat ) :    * a solution @xmath17 in which only a supercritical tension brane can be embedded , @xmath18 , where the induced metric has two curvature singularities at finite @xmath19 ( these are also at finite proper distance )    and three solutions where only @xmath20 branes can be embedded , namely    * a solution @xmath21 where the induced metric has a curvature singularity at finite proper and coordinate ) distance @xmath22 and an @xmath23 horizon at @xmath24 . * a solution @xmath25 with @xmath23 horizon at both @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath27 limit is also asymptotically ads . * a solution @xmath28 where both the bulk and the induced metric are ads .",
    "this is the solution found previously  @xcite .",
    "( we do not consider the fine tuned case , @xmath5 . )",
    "all these solutions are vacuum solutions with a negative cosmological constant in the bulk , i.e. solutions with constant scalar curvature . with the exception of @xmath28 , however , they are not maximally symmetric .",
    "the induced metric is not even a vacuum solution .",
    "it is worth noting that the corresponding embedding of 3-branes in 5 dimensional spacetimes can be similarly found , but the new solutions have little value because the induced 3-brane metric does not resemble our world at all .",
    "all our solutions have four - dimensional poincar invariance and can be trivially generalized to any maximally symmetric 4-dimensional metric replacing @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz ] ) .",
    "eventually the function @xmath30 is the same in that case , only @xmath31 is changed .",
    "the solutions have a complicated mathematical form and are expressed in an implicit form as solutions of algebraic equations involving special functions .    the usual picture of localization of gravity to a codimension one brane acquires some peculiar features when the brane tension differs from the fine tuned value .",
    "the warp factor that effectively compactifies the bulk decreases up to a distance @xmath32 in the extra dimension , but further away from the brane it starts to grow exponentially .",
    "the resulting  tail \" of the graviton wave function eventually delocalizes brane gravity .",
    "this effect is absent for exact fine tuning and _ is also relevant for 3-branes embedded in a 5 dimensional bulk _",
    ", e.g. for the models in  @xcite .",
    "models in which the brane tensions are far from their critical value do not seem to have brane gravity at all .",
    "we discuss in what extent this can be considered a coordinate artifact in sec .  [",
    "subsec : localiz ] .    at any point along the brane",
    ", another brane can be inserted at an angle determined by its tension . in coordinates where the first brane has a conformally flat induced metric",
    ", the second brane is curved .",
    "the ( covariant ) angle between the branes is @xmath33 .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 is independent of the tension of the second brane but changes as the intersection point is moved along the first brane ( @xmath35 corresponds to two solutions and tells if @xmath17 increases or decreases as one moves away from the intersection along the brane ) . for example , close to the curvature singularity @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , when several such wedges are sewn together in the same point , all branes will have the same parameter @xmath34 .",
    "now the induced metric on each brane is determined only by this @xmath34 ( and the choice of the @xmath35 sign ) , so that the first and last branes can always be identified in order to build a manifold around the intersection .",
    "the orbifolding condition only requires , for global consistency , that every second brane around the intersection has the same tension ( and @xmath35 sign ) .",
    "the new parameter @xmath34 tells what part of the full 6-dimensional spacetime is cut away .",
    "its emergence is due to the fact that the solution is not maximally symmetric . in the case of and",
    "@xmath37 solution , when the intersection point is shifted , the change in the metric can be compensated by a coordinate transformation , i.e. all points are physically equivalent . in our spacetime",
    "this is not so and @xmath34 parameterizes this difference . because the angle of the wedges depends on @xmath34 ,",
    "so does the total excess angle .",
    "the topological requirement that a vacuum density produces an excess angle can be satisfied without fine tuning : the gravitational equations simply set the brane angles and the parameter @xmath34 to the consistent value .",
    "when a brane tension is put on the 3-brane , another condition arises  @xcite which has not been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "a positive 3-brane tension tries to minimize the 4-volume , which corresponds to minimizing the value of @xmath30 at the intersection .",
    "there is such a minimum only in case  @xmath25 . now at the minimum the value of @xmath34 is zero , so we loose the additional freedom we had when we only needed to stabilize the 4-branes . for purposes of illustration",
    "we consider the following unusual but consistent geometry .",
    "we take two branes ( to be identified ) , of finite length . at each end",
    "the two are joined and the covariant intersection angle is taken to be more than @xmath38 . upon identifying the two branes we find an asymptotically @xmath37 spacetime which satisfies the gravitational equations except the minimizing of @xmath30 .",
    "introducing some additional repulsive interaction between the two 3-branes , one can keep them several ( 6-dimensional ) plank lengths apart to ensure the cancellation of the 4-dimensional cosmological constant .",
    "this requires a fine tuning of the new coupling constants .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [",
    "sec : solutions ] we describe all possible embeddings of a 4-brane with 4-dimensional poincar invariance and detail our observations on the localization of gravity to the brane . sec .",

    "[ sec : model ] we show that these joining branes can be sewn together in a global manifold and illustrate on a simple model why the additional interaction strengths need to be fine tuned .",
    "as explained in the introduction , we are looking for solutions to the six - dimensional einstein equations : @xmath39 these equations follow from the action with a number of branes included , @xmath40=\\int_{bulk}(\\lambda_6 - 2m_6 ^ 4 r[g])+\\int_{4-brane(s)}\\lambda_5,\\ ] ] while the units are so chosen that the bulk cosmological constant is set to  @xmath41 : @xmath42    we are looking at metrics that satisfy the ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz ] ) and the israel conditions  @xcite at @xmath10 , @xmath43 these conditions ensure that keeping the @xmath44 half plane and pasting back on another copy with @xmath11 identified can accommodate a 4-brane with tension  @xmath14 .",
    "note that the critical (  fine tuned \" ) value of the 4-brane tension is at @xmath45 in our notation .",
    "a direct calculation shows that the einstein equations in the bulk become @xmath46 while the israel conditions are satisfied at @xmath10 , @xmath47    in the following we use the notation  @xmath48 .",

    "the @xmath34 are parameters of the solution , one at each intersection .",
    "we must make sure , however , that a globally defined metric exists when the pieces we have discussed are sewn together .",
    "each brane carries orbifold boundary conditions , which are easiest to state in gnc s : we identify points with the sign of the corresponding coordinate @xmath56 flipped .",
    "this allows at most two different sets of 4-brane tensions ( @xmath14 ) in each intersection : every second one most be equal .",
    "the corresponding signs @xmath186 should also be chosen equal . in",
    "we join an odd number of branes in one intersection , then all must have the same @xmath14 and @xmath186 .",
    "when @xmath200 branes intersect along one 3-brane , the @xmath201 one must be identified with the first one .",
    "there are two conditions that must be met for consistency .",
    "( i ) the induced metric on the 3-brane must be the same for all wedges .",
    "this condition is always satisfied because the functions @xmath202 are always the same and no rescaling of the @xmath80 coordinates was necessary .",
    "( ii ) the induced metric on the @xmath201 brane must be identical with the induced metric on the @xmath203 .",
    "this condition is again automatically satisfied because , as we saw , the equality of @xmath204 and @xmath14 is sufficient for that .    in the following",
    "we consider a case with one positive tension 4-brane with two junctions around which the brane is identified with its own reverse side , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strip ] .",
    "we require , due to the effectively two dimensional gravity on the @xmath77 plane , an excess angle @xmath205 .",
    "this is possible only with @xmath206 ; and in order to have no curvature singularities , we will use type @xmath25 branes . because then @xmath72 must increase towards both ",
    "junctions \" , it must have a minimum ( at @xmath107 ) on the brane between then . using the excess angles @xmath207 as parameters , eq .",
    "( [ eq : anglesoln ] ) tells the parameter ( on each end separately ) @xmath208 . because for the @xmath25 type branes @xmath209 , we can accommodate only an excess angle at least as large as @xmath210 .",
    "the 3-brane tension can not be much smaller than the 4-brane tension . in brane",
    "gnc s the conformal factor is @xmath211 $ ] , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conf ] .",
    "we calculated the position of the two ends of the brane , with the result @xmath212 the proper distance of the endpoints from the origin is @xmath213^\\frac15.\\ ] ] consistency requires that this distance should be @xmath214 ( otherwise the underlying field theory description of gravity is not justified ) .",
    "this requires that the 4-brane tension not be much smaller than @xmath156 and also either @xmath215 or @xmath216 .",
    "the presence of a vacuum energy density on the 3-brane requires the proper amount of excess angle .",
    "when this relationship is not satisfied , our ansatz does not give a solution : the induced metric on the 3-brane is not flat any more .",
    "it is a trivial exercise to derive the equations of motion when a maximally symmetric but not flat 4-dimensional metric is allowed , i.e. @xmath217 is replaced by @xmath218 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz ] ) .",
    "we find that eqs .",
    "( [ eq4],[eq:4 ] ) are not modified , so that the function @xmath30 is not modified .",

    "( [ eq:3 ] ) gets replaced by @xmath219 so that @xmath31 changes .",
    "this change also affects the intersection angles , @xmath220    if the  mistuning \" is little , @xmath221 , the result is a small @xmath222 .",
    "this translates to a small observable hubble constant ( the induced metric must be brought to the form @xmath223 , @xmath224 ) , @xmath225    given that @xmath156 can not be made much smaller than @xmath14 , any sizable  mistuning \" of @xmath156 would result in a hubble constant on the 6-dimensional planck scale .",
    "up to this point however , we have not required any fine tuning .",
    "the 4-dimensional vacuum density , through the topologically required conical singularity of the metric enforces the adjustment of the parameter @xmath34 to its required value . however , when a 3-brane tension is added to the action , @xmath226=\\int_{bulk}(\\lambda_6 - 2m_6 ^ 4 r[g])+\\int_{4-brane(s)}\\lambda_5 + \\int_{3-brane}\\lambda_4,\\ ] ] the added term can be written as @xmath227 in order to avoid that the spacetime collapses onto the point where @xmath202 is minimum , i.e. @xmath107 , additional repulsive interactions have to be introduced .",
    "their strength has to be fine tuned to ensure that the equilibrium length of the 4-brane is that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : proper ] ) .",
    "the main result of this paper is that there exists embeddings of 4-branes in less than maximally symmetric 6-dimensional spacetimes that preserve 4-dimensional poincar invariance",
    ". then different points on the 4-brane are not physically equivalent as they were in the @xmath23 case .",
    "the angle between intersecting branes , in any fixed intersection point , is always determined by the nondynamical parameters through the israel conditions @xmath13 .",
    "we saw that there is no obstacle to building a global metric around the intersection and the additional parameter can be translated to an arbitrary excess angle .",
    "we also saw that there is no solution ( without fine tuning the 4-brane tensions ) with constant warp factor along the 4-brane . as a consequence , as we illustrated on a simple example , a 3-brane with tension tries to  move \" to the mininum of that warp factor and additional interactions are needed to stabilize the 3-brane .",
    "we note that in all suggested solutions to the cosmological constant problem   in brane contexts some sort of tuning of the bulk interactions has been required .",
