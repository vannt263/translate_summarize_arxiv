    "to meet its science requirements , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) @xcite places stringent requirements on the accuracy of its photometric calibration .",
    "the uniformity of photometric zeropoints across the sky is required to be 10 mmag in the grizy bands , and 20 mmag in u. additionally , color accuracy is required to be 5 mmag for colors that do not involve u , and 10 mmag for those that do . a plan for achieving these requirements",
    "is presented in @xcite .",
    "achieving this plan , and verifying the accuracy of its results , relies on external data in the form of photometric standards .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explore the possibility that gaia @xcite can contribute to the external data needed for lsst photometric calibration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : lsstphotocal ] presents an overview of the lsst photometric calibration process , and the role of external data .",
    "section [ sec : gaiadata ] is a brief summary of the gaia data products that are relevant to our purpose .",
    "section [ sec : directgaiastandards ] presents the transformation of gaia magnitudes into lsst magnitudes , and simulated results for both ms stars and wd .",
    "section [ sec : syntheticg ] presents the synthetic g band approach and simulated results for ms stars .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes our results , and implications for future work .",
    "the overall strategy for lsst photometric calibration is based on @xcite .",
    "they proposed _ directly _ measuring the system throughput as a function of wavelength , focal plane position , and time .",
    "further , the _ normalization _ of the throughput in each observation ( the gray - scale zeropoint ) and the _ shape _ of the throughput curve ( the wavelength dependent terms ) , are explicitly separated and measured with separate procedures for both the telescope system response and the atmospheric transmission .",
    "calibration systems based on this approach are already in use at panstarrs and des .",
    "the goal of the calibration process is to produce standard magnitudes , defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the normalized standard bandpass for band b , set a priori for the survey , @xmath6 is the object flux at the top of the atmosphere , and @xmath7 = 3631 jy . to calculate @xmath8",
    "the calibration system must determine , for each observation , the actual realized bandpass from detected electrons to the top of the atmosphere , @xmath9 , and a gray zeropoint @xmath10 .",
    "with these quantities in hand , the standard magnitude is calculated by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the instrumental magnitude ( log of counts ) and @xmath13 is the _ shape _ of the source spectrum , which we will refer to as the sed .",
    "several hardware systems are required to implement the approach , which we briefly describe :    * a dome screen projector designed to provide uniform ( @xmath14 variation ) illumination across the field of view , while minimizing stray light .",
    "this projector system will have the capability to not only illuminate the screen with broadband white light , but also narrow - band light to measure the system response at individual wavelengths .",
    "the narrow - band light will be generated by a tunable laser , capable of producing light from @xmath15  nm and tunable in 1  nm increments .",
    "the brightness of the screen is measured with a nist - calibrated photodiode , so that the relative intensity at different wavelengths can be precisely determined . * a 1.2-m auxiliary telescope with an @xmath16 spectrograph , located adjacent to the lsst itself .",
    "this auxiliary telescope will obtain spectra of a chosen set of atmospheric probe stars across the sky to determine an atmospheric absorption model .",
    "* water vapor monitoring system , consisting of a gps system and a microwave radiometer copointed with the lsst telescope , and monitoring a similar field of view .",
    "this supplements the auxiliary telescope spectra , which are unable to track the sometimes rapid variations of water vapor in time and space .",
    "lsst uses a form of self calibration , as pioneered by @xcite , to set the zero point for each exposure . the inputs to the self calibration process are the sed - corrected magnitudes of the calibration stars in band @xmath17 , @xmath18 , for the entire survey .",
    "these are calculated from the instrumental magnitudes @xmath12 , the object seds @xmath19 , the standard bandpass for the photometric system , @xmath5 , and the system bandpass at the moment of observation , @xmath20 as    @xmath21    self calibration utilizes the facts that the survey observes each calibration star many times over the course of the survey , and that the survey fields overlap , to construct a least squares system for the zero points of each observation .",
    "the resulting set of zero points for each band has an arbitrary offset , which makes it impossible to determine object colors without additional information .",
    "this additional information can come from a variety of sources :    * photometric standards in individual lsst bands . * photometric standards in a bandpass which can be synthesized from the lsst bands .",
    "* locus of a well understood stellar population in color - color space .",
    "the need for external information goes beyond simply determining the band zero point offsets , which , in principle , could be obtained from only a single standard . in practice , results from self calibration will contain some level of spatially dependent error , which tends to be greatest for the low - order spatial modes . assessing the magnitude of this error , and correcting it",
    "if needed , can only be performed if one or more of the above sources of information is available as a function of position on the sky .",
    "this is , of course , the more demanding application , and it is the one we focus on in this paper .    as we show below , gaia data can contribute both to band zero point determination and to verification / correction of self calibration errors through the first two of the approaches listed above .",
    "we do not discuss the third approach here , but refer the reader to @xcite as an example of its use .",
    "gaia s principal photometric data product @xcite is calibrated magnitudes through a broadband g filter .",
    "additionally , it produces low resolution red ( rp ) and blue ( bp ) spectra , and higher resolution ( rvs ) spectra within a narrow band intended mostly to supply radial velocities .",
    "it is tempting to use the rp and bp spectra directly to estimate the stellar sed @xmath22 and then use that to calculate the color terms needed to transform from the gaia g band to the 6 lsst bands .",
    "the biggest problem with this approach is that rp and bp spectra , due to their low resolution and relatively broad psf , can not be directly inverted to give the incident stellar sed with sufficient accuracy .",
    "preliminary simulations showed that systematic errors of order 0.1 mag are incurred , which rules out the direct approach for our purposes .",
    "we are better off taking a different approach , and instead using apsis @xcite , gaia s astrophysical parameters inference system .",
    "we realized that apsis , which of course utilizes bp / rp as a major input , would lead to smaller errors for our case .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , apsis takes account of data beyond bp / rp , in particular the parallax to determine absolute luminosity .",
    "second , apsis has built in the knowledge that these are not arbitrary spectra , but the spectra of stars .",
    "this prior knowledge significantly reduces the errors in the color terms @xmath23 ( defined in section [ sec : transforming ] ) from our initial naive concept .",
    "apsis utilizes all available gaia data for each star to infer the stellar parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath24 $ ] , and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath25 is a stellar extinction parameter used by apsis , which is within a few percent of the more commonly used extinction at 550 nm , @xmath2 , for values of @xmath26 near 3 . for our purposes",
    "the difference between @xmath25 and @xmath2 is inconsequential , and in the remainder of the paper we use the more common @xmath2 . for sufficiently bright stars ( @xmath27 ) , this includes spectra from the rvs instrument , which substantially improves the accuracy of the resulting stellar parameters .",
    "the usable range of magnitudes for lsst standards is roughly @xmath28 , with the bright end set by detector saturation , and the faint end set by signal - to - noise for a 15 sec exposure .",
    "therefore , we must make use of stellar parameters determined without rvs .",
    "table [ table : apsis_accuracy ] shows the predicted accuracy of these parameters .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : lsstphotocal ] , the errors remaining after self calibration can be assessed and/or eliminated if we have an accurate set of photometric standards in the six lsst bands with a suitable distribution across the sky .",
    "work is in progress @xcite to obtain a small set of suitable white dwarfs observed with hst whose photometry can be accurately transformed to the lsst bands , but their number and spatial distribution may not be adequate to the task addressed here .",
    "the minimum number of standards required depends on the spatial power spectrum of the self calibration errors , and is difficult to determine in the absence of actual lsst data .",
    "the low order spatial error modes ( @xmath29 ) from self - calibration can be adequately measured over the roughly @xmath30 steradians observed by lsst with roughly ten standards .",
    "clearly , it would be desirable to have more , if only to verify that the power spectrum is negligible at higher @xmath31 values .",
    "as an upper limit , 2000 standards would provide one standard in each lsst field of roughly 10 square degrees .",
    "every lsst observation would then include a standard , and spatial error modes to @xmath32 would be tightly constrained .",
    "the number of standards employed in practice will be guided by the error characteristics of the self calibration process , and possibly constrained by the availability of ground - based spectroscopy resources ( see section [ sec : usingwd ] )    each observation of a standard constrains the self calibration equations by a direct measurement of the zero point at that place and time :    @xmath33    in this paper we are concerned with the uncertainties in determining @xmath34 that result solely from uncertainties in @xmath35 . in evaluating these ,",
    "we make two assumptions :    * @xmath36 is known exactly .",
    "this is of course not the case , since it depends on a variety of measurements with finite uncertainty , but this allows us to isolate the uncertainty which is due solely to the precision of the standard .",
    "* @xmath36 is sufficiently close to @xmath37 that the difference can be ignored in this context .",
    "this is not obviously the case , since @xmath37 is in principle arbitrary , but in the case of lsst we will pick @xmath37 to be statistically as close as possible to @xmath36 .",
    "we therefore approximate the calibration errors that result from an imperfectly characterized standard as @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the difference between the actual and assumed sed of the standard .      to make use of gaia data for lsst photometric standards , we must transform gaia g magnitudes into lsst magnitudes in each of the six lsst filter bands .",
    "as figure [ fig : bandpasses ] shows , the gaia g band is very broad compared with the lsst bands , and has an overlap with each of them .",
    "this suggests that an accurate transformation might be possible given an achievable level of knowledge of the stellar sed .",
    "the transformation process is as follows : @xmath40 where @xmath17 denotes one of the six lsst bands , and @xmath41 the gaia g band .",
    "@xmath42 we assume that the stellar flux , @xmath6 , can be adequately parameterized by the apsis stellar parameters @xmath43 , which in turn means that the color @xmath23 can also be so parameterized : @xmath44    our main concern in this paper is with the uncertainty in the resulting @xmath45 magnitudes when the stellar parameters are determined by apsis .",
    "the uncertainty is given by    @xmath46    the expected uncertainty in gaia photometry , @xmath47 , is presented in @xcite , and reproduced in figure [ fig : gaiaphotometricerrors ] .",
    "note that the uncertainties in the figure are for single visit photometry .",
    "the expected uncertainty in the end of mission photometry is lower by roughly @xmath48 , yielding uncertainties of roughly 0.4 mmag at g=16 and 0.8 mmag at g=18 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath47 makes a negligible contribution to the total uncertainty of 5 mmag required for lsst , as discussed in section [ sec : lsstphotocal ] .",
    "therefore we require the uncertainty @xmath49 to be 5 mmag or less .",
    "the remainder of the paper is largely occupied with the assessment of @xmath49 .      given the enormous number of stars in both the lsst and gaia catalogs in the relevant magnitude range , we can be highly selective in the stellar types we select as standards .",
    "the most useful stellar type for our purpose is not immediately clear , since it depends on the details both of the performance of gaia apsis , and on the shape of the lsst filter bandpasses .",
    "we first examine the suitability of main sequence ( ms ) stars .    in order to estimate the precision to which lsst magnitudes",
    "can be found using gaia s apsis , we simulate the observed magnitudes of the stars in the phoenix spectral library @xcite for the gaia g band and the lsst u , g , r , i , z and y bands .",
    "the phoenix spectra do not include interstellar reddening due to dust , so we redden them with the prescription of @xcite using @xmath50 .",
    "we then used the published uncertainties in the stellar parameters determined by apsis ( in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath51 and @xmath2 ) to find the standard deviation of the colors @xmath23 for objects whose parameters are within the apsis uncertainties . in this fashion , the standard",
    "deviation and other statistics concerning the predicted precision of gaia measurements of stars can be found .",
    "we neglect the covariance between the various stellar parameters , which surely results in an overestimate of the dispersion in the resulting colors .",
    "this assumption is necessary due to our lack of knowledge of the covariance terms , which have not yet been published .",
    "the overestimate is likely in the range of 2 to 4 .",
    "it is necessary to interpolate between the phoenix data points because the phoenix spectra used as input are widely spaced in stellar parameter space , so that typically only a few spectra are within the range of uncertainty of the apsis stellar parameters .",
    "the interpolation program linearly interpolates in @xmath52 and @xmath2 between the magnitudes calculated from the available spectra .",
    "the program selects the interpolated points drawn from a 4-dimensional normal distribution with variances determined by the expected apsis errors , and then calculates the lsst magnitudes for each point .",
    "it then finds the standard deviation of the @xmath23 colors of the indistinguishable points , in order to find the predicted error from gaia data .",
    ".accuracy of astrophysical parameter estimation ( internal rms errors ) with the apsis algorithm aeneas using bp / rp spectra and parallaxes , but without rvs data @xcite .",
    "[ table : apsis_accuracy ] [ cols=\"^,>,>,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : wd_sd ]",
    "in this section we turn to the second approach mentioned in section [ sec : lsstphotocal ] , that the six lsst bands can be combined into an approximate gaia g band , and then compared directly with gaia g band photometry , a possibility suggested by @xcite . looking again at figure [ fig : bandpasses ]",
    ", it seems plausible that the gaia g bandpass can be reasonably approximated by linear combination of the lsst bandpasses @xmath53 which leads to @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the flux of an object with sed @xmath56 integrated over the bandpass @xmath57 .",
    "if the approximation were an equality , then we could directly compare , for all objects in the gaia catalog within the lsst magnitude range , this synthetic g band flux to the actual measured g band flux .",
    "any discrepancies beyond the expected random scatter would indicate a systematic problem with the lsst photometric calibration process .",
    "the spatial dependence of these discrepancies , and their dependence on stellar parameters , particularly @xmath0 , would give clues to what aspects of the calibration process were at fault .",
    "additionally , it might also be possible to correct the lsst fluxes to minimize the discrepancies , while maintaining consistency with our knowledge of stellar populations in color - color space , thereby improving the lsst calibration . in practice",
    ", there will be a significant difference between @xmath58 and @xmath59 , so that @xmath60    leading to a systematic flux error @xmath61 figure [ fig : gaiagsynthresid ] shows @xmath62 as a function of @xmath63 , expressed in magnitudes , evaluated over the entire phoenix sed set restricted to stars with @xmath64 .",
    "this restriction corresponds roughly to @xmath65 .",
    "cooler stars show much larger residuals .",
    "as shown in the figure , if the @xmath66 magnitudes are corrected with a third order polynomial in @xmath63 , then the remaining scatter is @xmath67 mmag , negligible in the lsst context .",
    "note that the same approach could be used for wd , with a smaller scatter , but also a much smaller sample of stars .",
    "it is clear from this that @xmath66 magnitude residuals will be diagnostic of any systematic errors in lsst calibration that exceed the 5 mmag level required by the srd .",
    "if a significant level of systematic error is found , the @xmath66 data can be employed to diagnose the causes , though not as directly as with the direct standards discussed in section [ sec : directgaiastandards ] .",
    "could we use the @xmath66 data to directly constrain , and thereby improve , the self calibration process , as we can with the direct standards ?",
    "the main limitation is that , given an error @xmath62 for some particular star , there is not a unique way to decompose it into the errors in the individual lsst bands . in the six dimensional lsst photometry space ,",
    "we can move it anywhere on the five dimensional hyperplane given by @xmath68 to remove this degeneracy , we can additionally require that the star must remain on the color - color track for its stellar population . to the extent that this track is scatter free , the corrections to the individual lsst magnitudes can be uniquely assigned . again , wd may be more valuable than ms stars for this purpose .",
    "a quantitative assessment of the resulting accuracy is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we investigated two different approaches to using gaia data to provide accurate photometric standards for wide - field surveys such as lsst .",
    "in the first , gaia g - band photometry is combined with stellar parameters derived from the gaia apsis pipeline ( for ms stars ) or from ground based spectroscopy ( for wd ) to determine the transformation from g - band to the six lsst bands .",
    "the accuracy achieved with ms stars falls well short of lsst requirements , though with potential for improvement through the use of ground based spectroscopy .",
    "direct standards derived from wd have the potential to meet lsst requirements , particularly if they are restricted to high galactic latitudes .",
    "additional work will be required to realize this potential in practice .",
    "possible systematic errors in wd sed models must be carefully assessed , and the accuracy of interstellar reddening derived from ground - based spectroscopy or from gaia rp / bp spectroscopy needs to be more carefully quantified .",
    "both of these tasks will become possible in the near future using multi band hst photometry in conjunction with ground - based spectroscopy .",
    "it is worth noting that the ground - based observations required to realize the potential of gaia wd for photometric calibration may require substantial investment of telescope resources if a large number of standards is desired .",
    "a spectrum of a single wd in our magnitude range requires roughly two hours of exposure time on a 6 meter class telescope to reach the necessary signal - to - noise .",
    "similar considerations apply to the use of ms stars .    in the second approach ,",
    "the six lsst bands are linearly combined into a synthetic g - band which approximates the gaia g - band . although the two g - bands have significant wavelength dependent differences , the resulting two sets of magnitudes have very small differences for most stars with @xmath69 .",
    "this allows a useful check on the spatial dependence of lsst calibration accuracy , and within currently unknown limits , the correction of such systematic errors .",
    "it seems worthwhile to actively pursue both approaches during the next years , as gaia science data is released , and lsst nears operation .",
    "we wish to thank drs .",
