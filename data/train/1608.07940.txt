    "the importance of spin measurements for studies of hadron  interaction dynamics is well known .",
    "however , there are very few well established experimental facts regarding behavior and dependence of spin observables at high energies .",
    "in particular , the knowledge of the energy dependence of such observables is crucial for the analysis since it could justify , or not justify , neglecting the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the lhc machine provides record energy of collisions and could definitely help in this matter .",
    "the feasible experimental direction of the spin studies is based on the self - analyzing particle decays , the mostly known example of which is the weak decay of @xmath0-hyperon ( cf .",
    "e.g @xcite ) . to study energy dependence of spin effects",
    "it is most relevant to choose the respective reaction where measurements have already been performed in the widest range of energy variation , namely , the measurements of the polarization of the above mentioned final @xmath0-hyperon in the inclusive reaction @xmath1 .",
    "it is the most interesting and persistent for a long time spin phenomena which was observed in inclusive hyperon production in collisions of unpolarized hadron beams .",
    "a very significant polarization of @xmath0hyperons has been discovered more than four decades ago ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) and",
    "experimentally , the process of @xmath0-production has been studied more extensively than other hyperon production processes .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the particular pattern of @xmath0polarization . in addition , the spin structure of this particle seems rather simple and is determined by spin of strange quark in the @xmath2-quark model .",
    "experimental results on hyperon polarization are widely known , those are being stable during a long time and well documented .",
    "polarization of @xmath0 produced in the unpolarized inclusive @xmath3collisions is negative ( it is perpendicular to production plane and directed opposite to the normal to this plane ) and energy independent",
    ". it increases linearly with @xmath4 at large transverse momenta ( @xmath5 gev / c ) , and for such values of transverse momenta is almost @xmath6-independent .",
    "the comprehensive review of the experimental situation is given in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the above results are for the hyperons which appear to be the proton s fragmentation products .",
    "no energy independence of global polarization has been observed for @xmath0 s produced in the nuclear @xmath7interactions @xcite .",
    "the recent rhic data ( with high error bars , though ) could imply energy decrease of global polarization of @xmath0 and could testify that the different leading dynamical mechanisms result in the strange quark polarization in nuclear collisions .",
    "however , one should also take into account that the data in this case are for the polarization measured with respect to reaction ( not production ) plane    perturbative qcd amended by the collinear factorization scheme leads to vanishing values of @xmath0polarization @xcite and does not correspond to the experimental data values and observed trends . including the higher twists contributions allows one to obtain higher values for polarization but does not change qualitative dependence @xmath8 at large transverse momenta@xcite .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile the decreasing dependence with the flat one observed in the data .",
    "inclusion of the parton internal transverse momenta ( @xmath9effects ) into the polarizing fragmentation functions leads also to decreasing trend of polarization @xcite .",
    "it allows again to change the scale only .",
    "the aim of this note is to provide an argument for measurements of the hyperon polarization at the lhc energies . for that purpose",
    "we discuss the mechanism leading to a nondecreasing energy dependence of the final state transverse polarization of @xmath0 produced in @xmath3-collisions .",
    "we also briefly present an experimental feasibility of such measurements .",
    "in the simple quark model the u- and d - quarks in @xmath0 are coupled to s=0 , i=0 diquark .",
    "it is strange quark polarization is responsible for the significant transverse polarization of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , to explain the @xmath0-polarization the dynamical mechanism of the strange quark polarization should be developed .",
    "there were several proposals for an explanation of the polarization of strange quarks produced in the collisions of the unpolarized protons . among them",
    "one should note the mechanism based on thomas precession @xcite and lund model @xcite .",
    "the both explanations are semiclassical in its nature .",
    "there is another semiclassical mechanism based on chiral spin filtering .",
    "we briefly mention it in order to stress that the measurements of the final hyperon polarization at the lhc energies could have sense since this particular mechanism leads to a nonvanishing polarization of @xmath0 when collision energy increases .",
    "the polarization of the strange quarks might happen to originate from a genuine nonperturbative qcd ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .    in the nonperturbative sector of qcd , there are two important phenomena , confinement and spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( @xmath10sb ) .",
    "the relevant scales are defined by the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "chiral @xmath13 symmetry is spontaneously broken at the distances which are in the range between the above two scales .",
    "the @xmath10sb mechanism leads to generation of quark masses and appearance of quark condensates .",
    "it describes transition of current into constituent quarks .",
    "constituent quarks are considered to be the quasiparticles , i.e. they are a coherent superposition of bare quarks and their masses have a magnitude comparable to a hadron mass scale .",
    "the hadron is represented as a loosely bounded system of the constituent quarks .",
    "the well known direct result of the @xmath10sb mechanism is appearance of the goldstone bosons ( gb ) .    the particles ( protons ) in the initial state",
    "are unpolarized .",
    "absence of polarization means that probabilities of states with spin up and spin down are equal .",
    "the main idea of the mechanism is filtering of the two initial spin states with due to different strength of interactions .",
    "this filtering acts like polaroid and leads to polarization of the particles in final state ( @xmath0 , in particular ) .",
    "the specific mechanism of such filtering can be developed on the basis of chiral quark model .",
    "namely , we exploit the feature of chiral quark model that constituent quark @xmath14 with transverse spin in up - direction can fluctuate into goldstone boson and another constituent quark @xmath15 with opposite spin direction performing a spin - flip transition @xcite : @xmath16 to compensate quark spin flip @xmath17 an orbital angular momentum @xmath18 should be generated in the final state of reaction ( [ trans ] ) .",
    "the presence of this orbital momentum @xmath19 in its turn means a certain shift in the impact parameter value of the final quark @xmath15 ( which in its turn is transmitted to the shift in the impact parameter of @xmath0 ) @xmath20 due to different strengths of interaction at the different values of the impact parameter , the processes of transition to the spin up and down states will have different probabilities which leads eventually to polarization of @xmath0 .    in the case of @xmath0polarization , the relevant transitions of constituent quark @xmath21 ( cf .",
    "1 ) is correlated with the shifts @xmath22 in impact parameter @xmath23 of the final strange quark , i.e. : @xmath24 relations ( [ spinflip ] ) clarify the mechanism of spin states filtering : i.e. when shift in impact parameter is @xmath25 the interaction is stronger compared to the case when shift is @xmath26 , and the final @xmath27-quark ( and @xmath0-hyperon ) becomes negatively polarized .",
    "the adopted mechanism of the spin states filtering is associated with the emission of goldstone bosons by the constituent quarks .",
    "it is important to note here that the shift of @xmath28 ( the impact parameter of the final hyperon ) is correlated with the shift of the impact parameter of the initial particles according to the relation between impact parameters in the multiparticle production @xcite : @xmath29 let the variable @xmath30 to be conjugated to the transverse momentum of @xmath0 , but relations between functions depending on the impact parameters @xmath31 are nonlinear .",
    "since we are considering production of @xmath0 in the fragmentation region , ( i.e. at large @xmath4 ) the following approximate relation @xmath32 which results from eq .",
    "( [ bi ] ) for other secondary particles .",
    "] is adopted .",
    "the main interest of this note is a trend for the polarization energy dependence , which can be checked experimentally .",
    "we note only that @xmath22 ( we assume that @xmath33 ) can be connected with the radius of quark interaction @xmath34 responsible for the transition @xmath35 changing quark spin and flavor : @xmath36    to evaluate polarization dependence on @xmath4 and @xmath6 we use semiclassical correspondence between transverse momentum and impact parameter values . the energy and @xmath6-independent behavior of polarization @xmath37 takes place at large values of @xmath6 : @xmath38 this flat transverse momentum dependence results from the similar rescattering effects for the different spin states .",
    "the numeric value of polarization @xmath37 can be large since there are no small factors in ( [ polllg ] ) .",
    "we use the model @xcite where @xmath39 is proportional to two nucleon masses , the value of parameter @xmath40 and @xmath41 fm .",
    "the above qualitative features of polarization dependence on @xmath4 , @xmath6 and energy are in a good agreement with the experimentally observed trends@xcite .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "2 demonstrates that the linear @xmath4 dependence is in a good agreement with the experimental data in the fragmentation region ( @xmath42 ) where the model should work .",
    "of course , the conclusion on @xmath6independence of @xmath0- polarization is a rather approximate one and insignificant deviations from such behavior can not be excluded .",
    "the proposed mechanism deals with effective degrees of freedom and takes into account collective aspects of qcd dynamics .",
    "together with unitarity , which is an essential ingredient of this approach , it allows to obtained results for polarization dependence on kinematical variables in agreement with the experimental behavior of @xmath0-hyperon polarization , i.e. linear dependence on @xmath43 and flat dependence on @xmath6 at large @xmath6 in the fragmentation region are reproduced .",
    "those dependencies together with the energy independent behavior of polarization at large transverse momenta are the straightforward consequences of this model .",
    "we discussed polarization in the particle production in the fragmentation region . in the central region where correlations between impact parameter of the initial and impact parameters of the final particles are weak",
    ", the polarization can not be generated due to the chiral quark filtering mechanism .",
    "the measurements performed by atlas collaboration @xcite at the lhc are in favor of this conclusion .",
    "moreover , it is clear that since antiquarks are produced through spin - zero goldstone bosons we should expect @xmath44 .",
    "the chiral quark filtering is also relatively suppressed when compared to direct elastic scattering of quarks and therefore should not play a role in the reaction @xmath45 in the fragmentation region , i.e. protons should be produced unpolarized .",
    "indeed , these features take place in the experimental data set .",
    "we considered here the mechanism leading to polarization of @xmath0 resulting from fragmentation of a colliding proton . from this point of view",
    "it seems rather naturally to expect a large polarization of @xmath0 in the process of diffraction dissociation @xmath46 the measurements performed at isr @xcite are in agreement with this observation .",
    "the results discussed in the previous section demonstrate that studies of spin effects at such high energy as the lhc provides are not senseless . here",
    "we mention a simple experimental feasibility for performing those measurements .",
    "the measurements are based on the studies of the weak decay of @xmath0 into @xmath47 and @xmath48 which allows one to reconstruct @xmath37 from the angular distribution of the proton @xmath49 produced as a result of this decay .",
    "it can be performed since this angular distribution is proportional to @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the angle between the nucleon momentum and the axis of the hyperon s polarization .",
    "plotting the distribution @xmath49 against @xmath52 the polarization can be obtained since the value of the decay parameter @xmath53 is known .",
    "two - track events should be used to reconstruct @xmath54 weak decays and it seems promising to use t1 and t2 inelastic telescopes of the totem experiment as a base for the relevant experimental set - up .",
    "the @xmath0 polarization direction is parallel to the normal to the production plane @xmath55 .",
    "this is the result of the parity conservation in strong interactions .",
    "the unit vector @xmath55 is determined by the product @xmath56 of the beam momentum @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( momentum of @xmath0 ) . in central rapidity region ,",
    "the transverse polarization of @xmath0 has been measured at the lhc @xcite , where small value of it has been found .",
    "however , polarization of @xmath0 in the diffraction dissociation processes is expected to be at the level 30 - 40% on the base of the experimental data extrapolations and simple semiclassical mechanisms estimations .",
    "it is important also to check an energy independence of the hyperon polarization observed at lower energies to bring deeper understanding of the diffractive physics and its dependence on spin .",
    "one could note that the instrumental experience obtained at cern isr at polarization measurements of @xmath0 ( under the use of e.g. r608 forward spectrometer @xcite ) could be helpful at the lhc too , and especially in the diffractive dissociation processes .    despite the discussion of the experimental use of polarized fixed target in the project called",
    "after@lhc @xcite is behind of the scope of this note , we should note that detection of spin direction of the @xmath0-hyperon produced in the final state would allow one to measure two - spin correlations .",
    "the measurements of such correlations would enhance the experimental studies with polarized target at after@lch .",
