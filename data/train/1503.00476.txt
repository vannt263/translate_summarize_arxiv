    "secondary nucleation during bijel formation has previously been observed in experiments and attributed to the finite rate of temperature change @xcite .",
    "however , it has not been suggested that secondary nucleation is responsible for bijel failure , rather it results in droplets inside bijel channels @xcite or even droplet - reinforced channels @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , our results show that bijel formation fails during slow heating with mps , whereas it succeeds with nps that were designed to have similar wetting",
    ". the np contact angle could simply be closer to @xmath69 . however , this does not agree with our observation that nps allow bijel formation over a wider range of drying times , which is expected to correspond to a wider range of contact angles @xcite .",

    "pinch - off events may also occur for nps : they can even be observed in 3d simulations of successful bijel formation @xcite .",
    "however , we suggest that nps sufficiently suppress the number of pinch - off events to allow successful bijel formation .    in order to explain why nps facilitate bijel formation ,",
    "we have found it particularly illuminating to consider the particle - size dependence of the `` driving force '' @xmath70 towards @xmath66 ( appendix [ sec : timescales ] ) i.e.  away from @xmath67 for bijels @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : bending_force ] ) as @xmath77 thus , nps demand a more strongly curved interface ( @xmath74 ) , but the driving force towards that curvature is smaller ( @xmath78 ) .    to assess to what degree a smaller driving force can facilitate bijel formation , we compare the disruption time @xmath79 to the jamming time @xmath63 ; bijel formation can succeed if @xmath80 .",
    "for the nps , we can estimate the jamming time from fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_coarsening](b ) .",

    "[ fig : figure_coarsening](b ) - and @xmath84 is the time just before @xmath83 drops to zero .",
    "this gives @xmath85 at a heating rate of @xmath16 .",
    "we can not obtain the mp jamming time directly , since mp bijels fail at @xmath16 .",
    "however , we expect the jamming dynamics to be dominated by the instantaneous area fraction of interfacial particles , which is independent of particle radius , as long as the final lengthscale is fixed ( appendix [ sec : timescales ] ) . as @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_confocal_formation ] , i.e.  @xmath87 is 1.8% vs 0.7% in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_confocal_final ] and @xmath88 @xcite , we expect @xmath89 .",
    "conversely , we can estimate the mp disruption time , @xmath90 from the time of occurrence of pinch - off in confocal images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_confocal_formation](b  d ) ) , whereas we can not estimate @xmath91 because bijel formation succeeds here for nps .",
    "however , we can predict the scaling of @xmath79 with particle radius by balancing the driving ( eq .  ( [ eq : bending_force_scaling ] ) ) and viscous - drag forces , to give @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a bulk fluid viscosity and @xmath94 is the typical length scale of the disruption , which is independent of particle radius ( appendix [ sec : timescales ] ) . given that the mps are @xmath25 larger than the nps , and assuming effects of particle polydispersity and roughness are negligible , the inverse scaling of @xmath79 with radius implies @xmath95 .",
    "these time - scale estimates help to explain the observed patterns of bijel failure , i.e.  they explain why @xmath96 but @xmath97 . to account for any possible dependence of @xmath79 on the ( final ) channel width , we have also verified that bijel formation is successful with nps at @xmath16 for similar @xmath49 , i.e.  for @xmath98 vol-% ( appendix [ sec : np_low_volume_fraction ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting here that , based on the scaling proposed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : disruption_time ] ) , we had expected that bijel formation would succeed with mps at @xmath99 .",
    "this is because it succeeds for similar @xmath49 with nps at @xmath16 ( and the nps are about @xmath100 smaller than the mps ) . as bijel formation with mps",
    "is only barely successful at a higher rate of @xmath43 , this suggests that an additional mechanism might be at play here ; currently planned simulations and experiments may be able to address this in the future .",
    "having said that , the mechanical - leeway mechanism proposed here does point in the right direction , i.e.  it can explain why bijel formation is more robust when using nps rather than mps .",
    "as shown above , slow heating increases the importance of bypassing droplet formation .",
    "we have suggested here that nps succeed in this because of their larger mechanical leeway , whereas mps may fail under similar conditions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_confocal_final ] ) .",
    "this also has technological relevance , since fast and homogeneous heating is challenging to achieve , putting severe restrictions on the choice of sample geometry and starting materials @xcite .",
    "therefore , reducing particle size could greatly facilitate formulation , especially when tuning particle surface chemistry is non - trivial ( as is often the case ) , even though a naive expectation based on an optimal ( static ) wetting geometry would suggest exactly the opposite trend .",
    "this mechanical - leeway mechanism not only applies to bijels but to any liquid template for solid particles .",
    "more broadly , leeway mechanisms may well aid any formulation where challenges arise due to tight restrictions on a pivotal parameter , but where the restrictions can be relaxed by changing a more accessible parameter ( here : particle size ) .",
    "this has important implications for the development of fabrication routes for advanced functional materials based on external templates .",
    "moreover , it is potentially relevant to the design of any soft material with a bespoke architecture by adjusting particle interactions , e.g.  crystallization of spheres with a size variation above the hard - sphere crystallization threshold ( @xmath101 ) @xcite is possible by changing the ionic strength of the suspending medium so that the interparticle - interaction range is large enough @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the formation of bicontinuous pickering emulsions ( bijels ) via liquid - liquid demixing is more robust with nanoparticles than with microparticles : a wider range of heating rates can be used .",
    "in addition , our results suggest that bijel formation using microparticles fails at low rates because the bicontinuous structure decays into discrete droplets via pinch - off events . to explain our observations ,",
