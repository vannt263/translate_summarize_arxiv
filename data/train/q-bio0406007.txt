    "studies of dynamical behavior of biological networks require numerical simulations of arrays containing a very large number of neurons . despite the variety of physiological processes involved in the formation of neuron activity ,",
    "the thorough studies of the large - scale networks need simple phenomenological models that can replicate the dynamics of individual neurons .",
    "various suggestions for the design of low - dimensional maps for modeling the neurons behavior have been proposed , see for example  @xcite and references therein .",
    "most of them were focused on the replication of either fast spikes or relatively slow bursts while the mechanisms for generation of specific footprints of spikes were neglected .",
    "a simple discrete - time model replicating the spiking - bursting neural activity has been suggested recently in  @xcite .",
    "this model is a 2d map that mimics rather realistically various types of transitions that occur in biological neurons .",
    "these transitions include routes between silence and tonic spiking as well as a triplet : silence @xmath0 bursts of spikes @xmath0 tonic spiking .",
    "such simple phenomenological models bear a high potential for further developments of computationally efficient methods for studies of functional behavior in large - scale neurobiological networks  @xcite .",
    "the bifurcation analysis of the map model carried out in @xcite has shown that the transition from silence ( a stable fixed point ) to generation of action potentials is characterized by a sub - critical andronov - hopf bifurcation when an unstable invariant closed curve collapses into the stable fixed point .",
    "therefore , the original map - model @xcite provides only an abrupt transition from silence to spiking as a control parameter ( e.g. the depolarization current ) passes the excitability threshold .",
    "this scenario is quite typical for most types of biological neurons .",
    "however , experimental studies suggest that some neurons may come out of the silence softly through the regime of small oscillations below the threshold of the spike excitation  @xcite",
    ". these subthreshold oscillations of almost sinusoidal form facilitate the generation of spike oscillations when the membrane gets depolarized or hyperpolarized  @xcite .",
    "these small oscillations can play an important role in shaping specific forms of rhythmic activity that are vulnerable to the noise in the network dynamics  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we modify the map model so that it can generate stable subthreshold oscillations .",
    "we start the discussion of the model dynamics with the analysis of local bifurcations of a fixed point of the map .",
    "we show that the loss of stability of the fixed point is accompanied by the birth of the stable invariant circle which initiate a family of canards in the map .",
    "further evolution of the circle leads to a breakdown of the invariant circle that gives rise to chaos .",
    "we also elaborate on the mechanism of the onset of irregular spiking which is due to heteroclinic - like crossings between the stable and unstable invariant sets , which are the images of the slow motion `` surfaces '' in the unperturbed map . the role played by small subthreshold oscillations in the responsiveness of the map to external noise",
    "is considered .",
    "the map - based model of spiking - bursting neuron oscillations , following @xcite , can be written in the form of the two - dimensional map    @xmath1    [ map1 ]    where the @xmath2-variable replicates the dynamics of the membrane potential , the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 control individual dynamics of the system .",
    "some input parameters @xmath6 and @xmath4 are employed to provide coupling with other such models afterwards ; both stand for injected currents .",
    "the principal distinction of the original map analyzed in  @xcite and the one in question is camouflaged in the function @xmath7 , which is given by    @xmath8    [ func ] the graph of this function is pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig - rhs ] .",
    "the shape of nonlinear function is meant to achieve a replication of sharp tonic spikes in the dynamics of the @xmath2-variable in the map .",
    "the slow @xmath9-variable can turn the spike generator on and off .",
    "the main difference between the function ( [ func ] ) and that in the map proposed in  @xcite is its shape on the left hand side of the discontinuity point , i.e. at @xmath10 .",
    "now the function contains an interval of parabola instead of a hyperbola used in @xcite .",
    "this modification is crucial for stability of subthreshold oscillations .",
    "the parabola reaches its minimum at @xmath11 . at this point",
    "the graph of the function is continued leftward by a horizontal line , see fig .",
    "[ fig - rhs ] .    ) , for the parameter values at the tangent bifurcation : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the function is discontinuous at the point @xmath14 which belongs to the rightmost interval , see ( [ func ] ) . ]      for map  ( 1 ) , when @xmath15 , the slow subsystem  ( [ mapy ] ) is decoupled from the fast subsystem  ( [ mapx ] ) , in which @xmath9 is regarded as a perturbation parameter .",
    "one may see from fig .",
    "[ fig - rhs ] that depending on @xmath9 , the fast subsystem may have two fixed points , one stable and one unstable , or no fixed points .",
    "the transition between these states occurs via a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "when @xmath9 is varied , the fixed points trace out a parabola in the @xmath16-plane as shown in fig .",
    "the traces of stable and unstable fixed points form on the @xmath17 stable , @xmath18 , and unstable , @xmath19 , branches , respectively .",
    "-bifurcation diagram of the fast subsystem , map  ( [ mapx ] ) , for @xmath12 and @xmath15 .",
    "the branches @xmath19 and @xmath18 are traced out by the stable and unstable fixed points of the fast map as the parameter @xmath9 varies .",
    "when @xmath20 , this @xmath16 plane becomes the phase portrait of the 2d map .",
    "the shown trajectory of the 2d map is computed at @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the dashed curves are the zero level ones for function  ( [ func ] ) . ]",
    "the point of intersection of these branches with the nullcline of slow subsystem ( [ mapy ] ) , which is given by @xmath24 , is a fixed point of the two - dimensional map ( 1 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that this fixed point @xmath25 is stable if it is located on @xmath18 and is unstable if it is on @xmath19 .",
    "the case where the nullcline crosses the parabola at the fold point requires a more delicate analysis .",
    "the nonstandard analysis  @xcite predicts that when @xmath26 , the normally hyperbolic branches @xmath18 and @xmath18 persist in the form of the stable and unstable  slow motion \" sets @xmath27 and @xmath28 that remain @xmath29-close to the originals , but @xmath30-close to them near the fold  @xcite .    the idea behind generation of tonic spikes in the map ( 1 ) is illustrated in fig .  [ yx1 ]",
    "the period of spiking is comprised of the following phases : the rest phase , where the phase point slides along the set @xmath27 at a rate of order @xmath29 towards the fold point .",
    "then , the phase point jumps up indicating the beginning of a spike .",
    "its upward motion is stopped by a delimiter ( the third segment of function  ( [ func ] ) ) that reflects the phase point towards the stable slow surface @xmath31 through the line segment @xmath32 .",
    "next we carry out the bifurcation analysis of the fixed point @xmath25 .",
    "our consideration is restricted to the domain @xmath33 , i.e. to the parabolic segment of function  ( [ func ] ) .",
    "this means that the fast subsystem  ( [ mapx ] ) is chosen to be close to the tangent bifurcation .",
    "the moment of the bifurcation is pictured in fig .  [ fig - rhs ] . from ( [ mapy ] )",
    "one finds the @xmath2-coordinate of the fixed point @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the fixed point is located at the parabolic segment of function when the parameter values are within the range @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath9-coordinate of the fixed point for this range of parameters is @xmath35 .",
    "since fixed point @xmath25 is a single fixed point of map ( 1 ) , the further stability analysis is reduced to two possible local bifurcations : a flip where one of the multipliers of the fixed point equals @xmath36 ; and the andronov - hopf bifurcation , where the fixed point possesses a pair of multipliers equal @xmath37 on the unit circle .",
    "simple calculations reveal that the flip bifurcation takes place outside of the considered parameter region .    in the case of the andronov - hopf ( ah )",
    "bifurcation , the jacobian @xmath38\\ ] ] of the map equals @xmath39 at the fixed point , while its trace equals @xmath40 .",
    "the equation of the corresponding bifurcation curve @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 on this curve , the fixed point has a pair of complex conjugate multipliers : @xmath43    to determine the stability of fixed point @xmath25 right at the bifurcation state we need to evaluate the sign of the first lyapunov coefficient @xmath44 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath44 is not an invariant as it depends on coordinate transformations .",
    "the critical fixed point @xmath25 is stable if @xmath45 , and unstable if @xmath46",
    ".     increases .",
    "top and bottom branches corresponds to the highest and lowest values of the @xmath2-variable for a given value of parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the other parameters of the map are set as follows @xmath22 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . ]",
    "let us introduce new coordinates in which the fixed point is translated to the origin : @xmath49 now the map looks as follows @xmath50 let us next make another transformation @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 defined in ( [ mult1 ] ) .",
    "this makes the linear part of ( [ mapfp1 ] ) a rotation through @xmath54 : @xmath55 in variable @xmath56 the map assumes the complex form @xmath57 with @xmath58 the normalizing transformation @xmath59 eliminates all the quadratic terms in ( [ complex ] ) so that the coefficient @xmath44 at the desired cubic term in the resulting normal form @xmath60 becomes the sought lyapunov value .",
    "its expression reads as follows : @xmath61 substituting ( [ coeffs ] ) into ( [ lyapunov1 ] ) yields @xmath62 for all small @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the loss of stability of fixed point @xmath25 on the andronov - hopf bifurcation curve is accompanied by the birth of a stable closed invariant curve emerging from @xmath25 .",

    "let us now consider the regime of subthreshold oscillations in the map with the presence of noise .",
    "for the sake of briefness we consider only the case when noise is applied to the fast subsystem .",
    "the discussion of the effects of noise , occurring in the fast and slow subsystems , can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the system  ( 1 ) in presence of noise can be written as follows @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a delta - correlated gaussian white noise ( gwn ) with zero mean value and standard deviation value @xmath64 .",

    "when the level of noise exceeds a critical level the map starts producing occasional spikes .",

    "these results are in good agreement with the results obtained from ode based neuron models  @xcite .",

    "[ chaos1 ] .",

    "a canard is characterized by a growing level of exponential instability with respect to nearby solutions .",
    "this instability is a necessary first component of chaotic behavior observed in a system .",
    "in addition , the presence of two types of canards creates mixing and uncertainty , which is the second important ingredient for the onset of chaos .",
    "this type of chaos in the neuron model ( 1 ) appears as small subthreshold oscillations alternating with sporadic spikes , see fig .",
    "[ chaos1 ] .",
    "to understand the dynamical mechanism behind the splitting of canards into two types , we conducted a numerical analysis of the behavior of @xmath27 and @xmath28 for various parameter values selected close to the threshold for the breakdown of the stable invariant circle .",

    "these oscillations are achieved by a special selection of a nonlinear function in the fast subsystem .",
    "the dynamical mechanisms behind the transitions from silence to subthreshold oscillations of small amplitude and then to spiking activity are explained using the bifurcation approach .",
    "here we focused mostly on the individual dynamics of the map - based model . as a result we considered only the case when @xmath6 and @xmath4 are constants .",
    "one may notice from ( 1 ) that the parameter @xmath6 can be eliminated by using the variable transformation @xmath77 .",
    "however , the role of input parameter @xmath6 becomes important when a time dependant input is considered , see  @xcite for detail .",
    "we would like to note that for studies of non - autonomous dynamics of this map model one needs to modify function ( [ func ] ) to insure that no trajectory of ( 1 ) gets locked in the interval @xmath78 as @xmath6 or @xmath9 increase .",
