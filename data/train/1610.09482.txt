    "<S> distributed consensus has been intensively studied in recent years as a means to mitigate state differences among dynamic nodes on a graph . </S>",
    "<S> it has been successfully employed in various applications , e.g. , formation control of multi - robots , load balancing , clock synchronization . however , almost all existing applications cast an impression of consensus as a simple process to iteratively reach agreement , without any clue on possibility to generate advanced complexity , say shortest path planning , which has been proved to be np - hard . </S>",
    "<S> counter - intuitively , we show for the first time that the complexity of shortest path planning can emerge from a perturbed version of min - consensus protocol , which as a case study may shed lights to researchers in the field of distributed control to re - think the nature of complexity and the distance between control and intelligence . besides , we rigorously prove the convergence of graph dynamics and its equivalence to shortest path solutions . </S>",
    "<S> an illustrative simulation on a small scale graph is provided to show the convergence of the biased min - consensus dynamics to shortest path solution over the graph . to demonstrate the scalability to large scale problems , a graph with 43826 nodes , which corresponds to a map of a maze in 2d , </S>",
    "<S> is considered in the simulation study . </S>",
    "<S> apart from possible applications in robot path planning , the result is further extended to robot complete coverage , showing its potential in real practice such as cleaning robots .    </S>",
