    "there is long expectation to find the signal of quark - gluon plasma formation in the high energy experiments of nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "indeed , not a few of the experimental results suggest the existence of the quark phase @xcite , but it seems that the incident energy is a little lower to observe the clean signals even at cern sps .",
    "the recent experiment at bnl rhic may give us cleaner and richer signals .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to give a manageable model for evolution of hadronic matter and quark - gluon plasma , produced in nucleus collisions , and to give some numerical predictions .",
    "there are two main ingredients in the model ; the evolution equation of the matter and the equation of state for hadrons .    in the evolution equation , assumed is cylindrical symmetry with respect to the collision axis , and used are the averaged quantities over the transverse plane .",
    "the averaged evolution equation is already reported in @xcite @xcite , and its benefits are in that the parameterization of the unknown initial - conditions becomes very simple and in that the concerned physical quantities , such as size and transverse velocity of the matter , are directly obtained , in contrast to the straightforward calculation of the relativistic fluid equation @xcite .    as for the equation of state for hadrons ,",
    "the compressible bag model @xcite @xcite @xcite is used , which has nice features as explained in the following . the simplest point - like pion gas model",
    "is often used but is lack of degree of freedom , and then it can not reproduce the observed multiplicity of hadrons as long as natural parameters are employed . on the other hand ,",
    "if the higher resonances are fully introduced in the point - like model , there appears the limiting temperature and the deconfinement transition to quark phase never takes place .",
    "the compressible bag model gives a solution for this dilemma , which gives sufficient degree of freedom and sufficiently high temperature because the mass of the hadrons becomes heavier as they are compressed by surrounding pressure .",
    "in this model the phase diagram with baryons is also calculable explicitly for whole region of parameters , and it coincides with the expected shape @xcite @xcite .        in fig .  1 , shown are the three steps in the nucleus collisions : at the first step",
    ", gluons are exchanged between the nucleons , and the both nucleus are shifted to higher color - charge state . the initial energy density is essentially given at this stage . in the second step ,",
    "the color flux is expanded in the longitudinal direction , and at proper time @xmath1 , the flux materializes into hadrons , quark - gluons or their mixed phase depending on the energy density . in the third step , the matter expands both in longitudinal and transverse directions , being cooled down to the freeze - out temperature , and then breaks into individual hadrons .",
    "since the present model treats the third step , in order to show explicit results of the model , we must take some assumptions for the initial energy density of the produced fluid .",
    "therefore the details of the results depends on the assumption , but it is shown that the quark - gluon phase is achieved in rhic experiments and that the signal of the phase transition , however , is difficult to observe in simple analyses of @xmath0 data .",
    "the latter is mainly because of the richness of freedom in hadron phase : the richness pushes up the entropy density in hadron phase , and its difference between hadron and quark phases become much smaller than that calculated in simple pion gas model .",
    "therefore the period of mixed phase becomes also smaller , and the typical structure of the first order phase transition is smeared out .    in the next section , the equation of state in the compressible bag model is briefly reviewed on the basis of the results of @xcite @xcite . in  3 ,",
    "evolution equations are presented for perfect fluid of hadron or quark - gluon or their mixture and it is revealed that the evolution equations have an expanding solution as well as a scaling solution . and relations to observables are also given . in  4 , the results of numerical calculations are given and discussed on the basis of the expanding solution for @xmath2-collisions and @xmath3-collisions .",
    "final section is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize the results of @xcite @xcite . let us suppose a mixed gas of @xmath4-kinds of meson enclosed in volume @xmath5 at finite temperature @xmath6 . in the compressible bag model , the free energy function @xmath7 of the gas",

    "the reason is that the acceleration in the mixed phase given by the right hand side of ( [ eq : dvtm ] ) has no @xmath170-term and an extra factor @xmath171 in @xmath172-term so that it takes smaller values than the acceleration in hadron / quark - gluon phase given by ( [ eq : dvt])/([eq : dvtq ] ) .",
    "this is a common feature to the case of massless hadron , which is supposed to be pion , discussed in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "the difference lies in the fact that the interval of mixed - phase start in the present case is narrower than the one in the case of a single massless hadron so that the structure is less prominent especially for @xmath173 .",
    "this is because the degree of freedom in the hadron phase is larger for the present case which takes into account the contribution from continuum of meson resonances .",
    "however it should be noticed that the entrance to quark - gluon phase can be seen in this figure plotted in the log scale of @xmath122 in contrast to fig .  3 plotted in the linear scale .",
    "is shown as a function of @xmath122 with varying @xmath174 .",
    "the parameters are set as @xmath124 , @xmath148 , @xmath157 . ]",
    "is shown as a function of @xmath122 .",
    "the parameters are set as @xmath124 , @xmath148 , @xmath157 .",
    "the experimental data are taken from @xcite . ]    in fig .",
    "10 @xmath0 is shown as a function of @xmath122 for @xmath175 with varying @xmath144 from 1 to 240 . to this variation",
    "the response of @xmath0 is mild and does not become so large even for @xmath176 . in fig .",
    "11 the final radius @xmath177 is shown as a function of @xmath122 for @xmath175 with varying @xmath144 from 1 to 240 .",
    "the experimental data are taken from @xcite .",
    "the calculated values does not differ so much from the observed values .",
    "it should be noticed that @xmath177 is rather insensitive to the variation of @xmath117 . as for the response to the variation of @xmath145 , @xmath177 becomes larger for smaller @xmath145 .",
    "is shown as a function of @xmath144 .",
    "the parameters are set as @xmath124 , @xmath148 , @xmath157 . ]    finally in fig .",
    "12 the initial temperature is shown as a function of @xmath144 for @xmath178@xmath179 .",
    "for @xmath180 the entrance to the mixed phase occurs at @xmath181 and the entrance to the quark - gluon phase does not occur even at highest @xmath144 . for @xmath182",
    "the entrance to the mixed phase occurs at @xmath183 and the entrance to the quark - gluon phase occurs at @xmath184 . as for @xmath176 the entrance to the mixed phase occurs at @xmath185 and the entrance to the quark - gluon phase occurs at @xmath186 .",
    "thus quark - gluon phase will be realized at bnl rhic energies while it is not at cern sps energies .",
    "we have shown that our simplified fluid model easily calculates observables in nucleon - nucleon and nucleus - nucleus collisions at high energy region .",
    "as for the equation of state for hadron phase , we have adopted the compressible bag model .",
    "this model can satisfy both requirements that one should take into account an infinite degrees of freedom of hadrons and that deconfinement transition should be take place , which usually contradict mutually in models other than compressible bag model . for an evolution of the fluid",
    ", we have assumed the cylindrical symmetry with respect to the collision axis and solved the averaged quantities over the transverse plane .    in the previous paper @xcite of the averaged evolution equation",
    ", we used the equation of state of massless pion for hadron phase .",
    "both calculations give the result that agrees well in terms of qualitative analysis .",
    "however , the present approach produces @xmath187 times of pions in comparison with the previous one .",
    "this gives a reasonable value for @xmath110 by the condition of ( [ eq : tau0fix ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio @xmath188 becomes smaller because of the increase of hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the increase of the average transverse momentum is brought about by a transverse flow of the fluid . as is seen from ( [ eq : dvt ] ) the pressure slope",
    "@xmath189 in the transverse direction mainly causes the transverse flow . in the mixed phase the effect from the corresponding term became smaller as shown by equation ( [ eq : dvtq ] )",
    "this gives a structure of an average transverse momentum as a function of @xmath122 . in the hadron and the quark - gluon phase the ratio of the pressure to the energy density increases rapidly with the increase of the energy density .",
    "the ratio in both phases reaches @xmath190 in high energy density limit , so that the acceleration is generated similarly in both phases as shown in fig .",
    "9 . in the case of the quark - gluon phase",
    "start the acceleration becomes weaker because of passing through the mixed phase . as for @xmath3-collisions",
    "the acceleration becomes weaker with an increase of @xmath144 because of a decrease of the pressure slope in the transverse direction .    as shown in figs .",
    "8 and 9 @xmath122 is not a reasonable variable for plotting the observables in @xmath3-collisions except for the transverse source radius . in our model",
    "the equations of ( [ eq : dvt ] ) and ( [ eq : eps0 ] ) generate the @xmath144 dependence .",
    "we have to find a scaling variable in @xmath3-collision .",
    "we have assumed the relation between the initial energy densities in @xmath2- and @xmath3- collisions by equation ( [ eq : eps0 ] ) .",
    "this power - law assumption is similar to the relations given by the dilute - gas and multiple - collision models @xcite .",
    "finally we predict that the quark - gluon plasma can be observed for average multiplicity events in @xmath3-collision with @xmath191 at rhic energies .",
