    "this scaling relation may be used to study whether bulge populations are younger than those of elliptical galaxies , with the basic assumption that elliptical galaxies in clusters are old . however , stellar population studies in the wavelength region of the mg@xmath3 index @xcite indicate that mg@xmath3 is affected by age and metallicity ; that mg is overabundant w.r.t .",

    "the decrease of cat@xmath0  with @xmath1 may be a result of a dwarf - enhanced imf or a low ca / fe abundance ratio for giant ellipticals . in a similar study , ( * ? ? ?",

    "the main advantages of these new definitions over the previous ones ( e.g. @xcite ) are that they have been designed to ease problems in the definition of the continuum bands , the contamination of the paschen lines , and the sensitivity to the s / n ratio and velocity dispersion ( see @xcite for more details ) . in order to explore the dependence of the relation of line - strength and velocity dispersion on aperture",

    "the exclusion of one of our low - velocity dispersion galaxies ( ngc  7457 ) , provides an even better agreement in the slope values ( b[us]=-0.52@xmath110.19 ) .",
    "however the rms of our data around the best fit is much smaller ( rms[cat@xmath0(us)]=0.14 ) than the one measured by ( rms[cat@xmath0(cen02)=0.28 ) . on the other hand ,",

    "previous studies of the same sample by some of us , studying deviations of bulges from the fp of ellipticals and s0s @xcite or color - color diagrams @xcite , conclude that bulge populations are old , but could be younger than ellipticals by up to 2.5 gyr .",
    "the higher pat  values , and correspondingly younger ages for bulges could also be due to young stars in the centre of our galaxies .",
    "however , model predictions indicate that young populations ( @xmath41 gyr ) , which increase the value of the patindex , also lower the value of cat@xmath0 , which is opposite to what we find here . given the small significance of the offset it is more likely that flux calibration differences contribute to the observed shift . for the most extreme case in the sample ( ngc  5965,pat=0.91  ) the high pat   could be due to star formation induced by the presence of a strong bar in this galaxy @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we find no correlation of the pat  index with @xmath1 , a result supported by for es , and contrary to the strong trend found by .",
    "an explanation for that difference could be in the velocity dispersion correction they have applied to each galaxy in their sample .",

    "can be interpreted as underabundance of ca w.r.t .",
    "the other metals in more massive galaxies . other possibilities are : 1 ) an imf biased towards low - mass stars , 2 ) composite stellar populations including a low metallicity component or a young and old population of the same metallicity , and 3 ) ca depletion .",
    "we discuss the advantages / disadvantages of each one of these possible explanations in turn .",
    "the problem of the ca underabundance has been previously addressed by several authors ( @xcite , ) .",
    "it is hard to find an evolutionary scenario that can produce non - solar ca / mg values . assuming that both ca and mg are produced by two `` flavours '' of sne in which more massive stars ( 20 - 40 ) produce mg before ( @xmath212.6 myr ) ca , generated in less massive stars ( 12 - 30 )",
    ", one could explain a small discrepancy in abundances between mg and ca @xcite . however , large abundance ratio differences are hard to obtain in this way , and impossible to get for real galaxies , for which the formation timescale is probably much larger than a few myr .",
    "if we would use @xmath2-enhanced isochrones ( @xcite , vaz03 ) , required to get the correct [ mg / fe ] ratios in giant ellipticals , assuming a solar - like element partition for the [ mg / ca ] and [ fe / ca ] , we would predict even larger ca indices , increasing the discrepancy .",
    "next we discuss the apparent ca underabundance at large velocity dispersions in terms of a dwarf - enhanced imf .",
    "the universality of the imf has been a matter of controversy in the last decades ( see @xcite and @xcite for current reviews of observational keys in favour and against this statement ) .",
    "imf time variations among ellipticals have been studied by @xcite in detail .",
    "an advantage of this approach is its ability to explain both , the large mg and the [ mg / fe ] values observed in giant ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the effect of a dwarf - dominated imf is a weakening of the cat@xmath0  index ( vaz03 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this effect is stronger at high metallicities .",
    "as also mentioned in , there are four observational drawbacks against this hypothesis : first : indications of an imf flatter than salpeter in the bulge of our own galaxy @xcite , second : the fact that the predicted feh 9916   feature is significantly stronger than what it is observed @xcite , and third : the discrepancy between visual m / l ratios ( m / l@xmath1710 , @xcite ) and dynamical estimates m / l@xmath216 @xcite .",
    "an additional drawback is that visual - infrared ( @xmath22 ) colors are just at the verge of what it is observed in es , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the use of composite stellar populations is analysed by .",
    "their analysis reveals that a combination of populations including a low - metallicity component was not able to explain the low value of cat@xmath0  and cat  together with h@xmath23 for the most massive galaxies .",
    "our independent analysis confirms their result .",
    "ca is known to be highly depleted onto dust in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "could it be that it is also depleted in stars ?",
    "the evidence is not strong .",
    "such depletion in stars would require that , during star formation , interstellar dust is recycled less than interstellar gas . moreover , depletion would have to be stronger in more dusty galaxies , so one would expect a large scatter in the cat@xmath0   @xmath1 relation due to depletion .",
    "at least , the scatter for bulges of spirals , which are generally more dusty than ellipticals , should be larger .",
    "since this is not seen , we argue that depletion can be excluded as the origin of the low cat@xmath0  values .    in summary , many mechanisms can be used to try to explain the apparent underabundance of ca for massive galaxies .",
    "however none of them alone seems to be able to explain all the observations . in the light of the discrepancies found between all the possibilities",
    ", a combination of several effects could be in place .",
    "more work is still needed to provide an answer to this problem .",
