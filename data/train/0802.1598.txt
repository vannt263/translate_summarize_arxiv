    "the electronic transport properties of atomic point contacts between two metallic electrodes have recently been the subject of great interest , both from the experimental and theoretical points of view . on the experimental side",
    "such atomic sized conductors can be obtained either by means of scanning tunneling microscopes @xcite or by using mechanically controllable break junctions @xcite . in some materials , for instance gold , monatomic chains , several atom long ,",
    "are spontaneously obtained @xcite .    in these experiments",
    "the conductance is measured during the elongation process and shows clear plateaus corresponding to the various stable atomic arrangements in the constriction region . in noble and alkali metals",
    "the last plateaus before breaking are very close to multiples of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "oscillations of the conductance with the length of the suspended chain are also observed @xcite . in transition metals even though plateaus are still present , the quantized behaviour is much less clear .",
    "however , thanks to the great mechanical stability of the break junction technique , the system can be stabilized for a given value of the conductance .",
    "this is essential in the case of magnetic materials since it allows to perform a series of magneto - resistive measurements revealing a remarkably large anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) effects in materials like iron , cobalt or nickel @xcite .",
    "understanding these transport properties is a challenging problem and is of prime importance for their future applications in nano and spin electronics .",
    "theoretically this relies on the calculation of the transmission factor @xmath4 of an electron at energy @xmath5 from an electrode to the other in the ballistic regime which is relevant for such devices . in a perfectly periodic nanowire",
    "the transmission factor of each electronic state is unity .",
    "therefore at small bias voltage the conductance is determined by the number of linearly independent electronic states at the fermi level propagating in a given direction ( transmission channels ) , and is quantized in units of @xmath3 or @xmath6 for a non - magnetic or magnetic material , respectively @xcite .    in a realistic system",
    "the electrodes are macroscopic and connected by an atomic sized constriction region .",
    "for such a system @xmath4 is limited by the number of channels in the narrowest part of the constriction . however , the transmission factor is usually smaller than this number due to scattering effects at the edges of the system .",
    "several methods have been proposed to calculate the electronic transport in atomic contacts but the most popular one is using an expansion of the electronic states on a local basis set which allows an easy partition of the system into three parts : the two leads and a central part . in this approach @xmath4",
    "can conveniently be obtained from the green function of the central part interacting with the electrodes , by using the fisher - lee formula @xcite .    in this work we use a tight - binding green function formalism to investigate the role of ( geometric or magnetic ) defects and contacts on the transmission factor , and thus the conductance at low - bias voltages , of atomic junctions with simple geometries .",
    "most of the calculations we present here have been devoted to iron , using a realistic tight - binding hamiltonian @xcite which includes magnetism and , possibly , the spin - orbit coupling term @xcite . for the sake of comparison we have also considered gold which contrary to iron",
    "is non - magnetic and has electronic states of pure @xmath0 character at the fermi level .",
    "we show in the following that the monatomic perfect wire model @xcite which has been used to explain experimental results is not reliable , at least for transition metals , since the presence of defects and contacts strongly perturbs the transmission factor of the various conductance channels .",
    "indeed , even in the limit of long chains , the behaviour of the perfect infinite wire is not recovered due to contact effects .    in sec .",
    "ii we present the theoretical model and give some details about practical computations . sec .",
    "iii a is devoted to the study of the influence of a geometrical or magnetic defect in a monatomic iron wire .",
    "the role played by atomic contacts is discussed in sec .",
    "iii b , and a comparison is made between fe and au .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "finally details of algebraic calculations are presented in the appendices . in appendix",
    "a we derive the fisher - lee formula for the general case in which the atomic spin - orbitals ( and thus the overlap integrals ) and the hamiltonian matrix may be complex .",
    "appendix b explains the method used for the calculation of the surface green function .",
    "appendix c gives the main steps in the derivation of the transmission factor for a simple model studied in the text .",
    "the electronic structure is derived from an hamiltonian operator @xmath7 expressed in a non - orthogonal basis set of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 atomic spin - orbitals hereafter denoted as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an atomic site , @xmath10 an atomic orbital and @xmath11 the spin .",

    "calculations @xcite was found .",
    "finally let us mention that , although we have shown in recent publications that orbital polarization effects @xcite ( taken into account by a more accurate expression of the electronic interaction hamiltonian @xmath37 ) may have an influence on the electronic and magnetic properties of nanostructures , we have ignored them in the following since the aim of the present work is to discuss the effect of contacts on transport properties that are present whatever @xmath17 .    in the following , for the purpose of deriving qualitative arguments",
    ", we have also used an hamiltonian @xmath14 limited to @xmath16 for an @xmath0 band .",
    "we calculate the electric conductance in the landauer - bttiker approach @xcite .",
    "the system is divided into three parts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] ) : a central scattering region ( c ) and two semi - infinite leads ( l and r ) with two - dimensional periodicity .",
    "the transmission probability @xmath4 of an electron with energy @xmath5 is obtained from the green function formalism .",

    "here we have considered the general case where the overlap matrix ( thus the atomic spin - orbitals ) , and the hamiltonian matrix elements may be complex .",
    "the expression of @xmath4 is derived in appendix a following the same spirit as in the work of viljas _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in this appendix",
    "we show that the fisher - lee relation is still valid in the general case , _",
    "i.e. _ :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the retarded green function of the central part defined by the relation :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the identity matrix and @xmath55 . in practice",
    "we add a small but finite imaginary part @xmath56 to the energy . in the following the superscript @xmath57",

    "solving eq .",
    "[ green ] for @xmath52 yields :    @xmath58    @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the self energy terms which account for the coupling of the central part to the leads , _",

    ". this surface green function is calculated in the absence of the scattering region and thus is different from the green function @xmath63 defined in eq .",
    "[ green ] .",
    "the functions @xmath62 need to be calculated only on the atoms of the leads which are in contact with the scattering region .",
    "the calculation of the central green function @xmath64 is now reduced to the inversion of a matrix of size @xmath40 .    finally ,",
    "experiments being performed at small bias voltage and low temperature @xcite eq.[eq : itot2 ] leads to a conductance given by    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the fermi level of the system .",
    "note that the quantum of conductance is here given by @xmath67 and not @xmath3 because we are considering magnetic materials .",
    "the atomic structure of the leads is that of a semi - infinite crystal with two dimensional periodicity but , due to the presence of the central region , their electronic structure and magnetic moments are modified near the scatterer and no longer periodic .",
    "however the choice of the scattering region is arbitrary and can include a part of the leads containing the atomic planes around which the matrix elements of the hamiltonian are significantly different from the bulk ones .",
    "we therefore define an effective scattering region by adding a part of the leads to the central part . in practice for bcc",
    "@xmath68 three atomic planes are added on the left - hand side of the scatterer and two on the right - hand side .",
    "the computing process runs as follows .",
    "first we calculate the electronic structure and magnetic moments of the effective scattering region , and since in most of the cases considered in this work the left and right leads are identical , we have added periodic boundary conditions in the three directions . with that procedure",
    "the bulk like behavior in the additional atomic planes is recovered faster .",
    "we thus obtain the hamiltonian of the central region @xmath39 from the self - consistent calculation in the effective scattering region , the fermi level being fixed to that of the leads .        in this geometrical configuration @xmath62 ( in eq.[selfenergy ] )",
    "is the surface green function of a truncated bulk in which the layer @xmath69 and interlayer @xmath70 matrix elements ( see appendix b eq . [ hl ] ) of the hamiltonian are the same as in the bulk , _",
    "i.e. _ , they are not modified by surface self - consistency effects .",
    "the hamiltonians of the leads @xmath42 and @xmath43 are obtained from a bulk calculation .",
    "we then calculate the transmission @xmath4 ( eq . [ transmission ] ) .",
    "we have first considered transport in the simple test case of a monatomic wire along the @xmath71 axis where the results can easily be interpreted . moreover ,",
    "this case is relevant for the study of break junctions .",
    "indeed experiments on gold or platinum have shown that a short monatomic wire may appear and stabilize during the breaking process @xcite . in iron junctions , both theory and experiments do note show evidence for the appearance of a wire @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the contact is still atomic and the geometric environment of the contact atom is very close to the environment of an atom in a monatomic wire .    in the following",
    "we study the influence of various defects on the transmission probability @xmath4 .",
    "first we study the effect of a geometric defect on the transport properties by considering a perfect infinite wire in which the distance between two atoms is stretched and soc is neglected .",
    "the leads are two semi - infinite wires with an interatomic distance @xmath72 and magnetic moment @xmath73 at equilibrium .",
    "the effective scattering region is made of @xmath74 atoms at the same equilibrium distance , save for the distance @xmath2 between the @xmath75 and the @xmath76 atoms which is stretched from equilibrium to @xmath77 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geometric ] ) . the magnetic moments in the scattering region",
    "are computed self - consistently .",
    "our calculation showed that the magnetic moments of the atoms near the defect increase with the distance @xmath2 as expected .",
    "for an iron monatomic wire with the geometric defect shown in the upper part ( @xmath78 ) . ]    the electronic transmission for different stretchings is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometric ] . for the perfect wire ( black curve ) , each channel has a transmission probability equal to unity and the total transmission is simply given by the number of electronic states at energy @xmath5",
    ". as the wire is stretched , the transmission of each channel decreases .",
    "we can see that the reduction of transmission probability is strongly energy dependent .",
    "the channels corresponding to @xmath79 and @xmath80 orbitals ( @xmath81 bands ) , which are localized in the plane perpendicular to the transmission direction @xmath71 , are more affected by the stretching of the central atom than the channels corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath82 orbitals .",
    "this explains the flattening of the high transmission peaks at @xmath83 and @xmath84 which correspond to @xmath81 orbitals .",
    "we now look at the effect of a domain wall on the electron transport in the absence of soc .     of an iron monatomic wire in the presence of a @xmath85 atom long magnetic wall ( see text ) . ]",
    "the leads are two semi - infinite wires with opposite magnetization directions .",
    "the scattering region contains a magnetic wall of length @xmath85 .",
    "the angle between the magnetization directions of two consecutive atoms in the wall is chosen to be constant and equal to @xmath86 .",
    "a first calculation shows that the presence of an abrupt wall ( @xmath87 ) results in an important loss of transmission .",
    "the transmission @xmath88 is due to the @xmath0 orbitals which are the only channels able to transmit in this case . indeed in transition metals , the magnetic moment",
    "is mostly carried by the @xmath2 electrons and in an iron wire the @xmath2 orbitals are totally polarized .",
    "thus no transmission is possible through the wall . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath0 orbitals are only partially polarized and are able to transmit .    when the magnetization is flipped by @xmath89 on one atom between the leads , leading to a domain wall with @xmath90 , the @xmath2 channels open and the transmission increases .",
    "this spin - flip transmission is made possible by the states in the flipped atom that mix spin up and spin down orbitals . as the length of the wall increases , the transmission quickly tends towards the transmission of a perfect wire with no domain wall .",
    "thus , in the ballistic regime , a magnetic wall a few atom wide has almost no effect on the electron transmission .",
    "this results is in good agreement with the calculation of velev and butler @xcite who showed that large magneto - resistance is expected only in contacts with very narrow domain walls .       in an iron monatomic wire with the geometric defect shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometric ] , as a function of the magnetization direction @xmath91 . ]    in this section soc is taken into account .",
    "therefore the electronic structure depends on the magnetization direction and anisotropic effects appear . in a perfect monatomic wire of a transition metal , soc removes the degeneracy of the @xmath81 bands except when the magnetization is perpendicular to the wire ( @xmath92 ) @xcite . in iron , these bands lie around the fermi level and the splitting can be strong enough to bring one of the bands above it when @xmath91 varies .",
    "thus , the conductivity of the wire ( which is proportional to the number of bands crossing its fermi level ) decreases by @xmath93 as the magnetization orientation is switched from @xmath89 to @xmath94 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : amr - wire ] , black curve ) . this anisotropic magneto - resistance ( amr ) in @xmath95 transition metal wires",
    "has already been reported @xcite .",
    "note that here and in all the following calculations in which @xmath91 is varied , a penalization function has been added to the hamiltonian in order to keep a fixed value of @xmath91 during the self - consistent iteration process ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if a geometric defect is present in the wire , the channel transmission is no more equal to unity .",
    "the curve of the transmission as a function of the magnetization direction for the same type of defect as in sect.[sec : geom_defect ] is no longer a step between two integer values but becomes continuous with a maximum reached at @xmath92 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : amr - wire ] ) .",
    "the amr is softened by the presence of the defect as already reported by jacob et al .",
    "we have seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : geom_defect ] that the @xmath81 channel was the most affected by a geometric defect in a wire . since the amr in an iron wire is only due to electrons in these @xmath81 bands it is strongly affected by the presence of a defect ( note that the domain of stretching is different in fig .",

    "[ fig : geometric ] ) .",

    "[ sec : defect ] that the transmission of an iron atomic wire is affected by geometric or magnetic defects .",
    "another strong effect arises since in practice the wire is always connected to some leads .",
    "these contact effects can become very important for instance in break junction experiments where the leads are bulk - like while the scattering region is quasi one - dimensional . to have a better understanding of the role of the contacts in the landauer formalism applied to break junctions , we studied the transmission of some simple systems .",

    "the atoms @xmath93 and @xmath85 are in four - fold position relative to the surface .",
    "the distance between atoms in the wire , in the leads and at the contact is given by the bulk interatomic distance at equilibrium of the considered material . ]    the simplest way to model the contact is to consider a non - magnetic wire of @xmath85 atoms with a single @xmath0 orbital per site and an hopping integral @xmath98 between first nearest neighbours .",
    "this wire is connected to two semi - infinite wires which have a different hopping integral @xmath96 but the same atomic level . the contact is established by a hopping integral @xmath97 between the leads and the edge of the finite wire ( fig .",

    "when @xmath102 increases the peaks broaden and are shifted so that some of them disappear .",
    "thus , the number of oscillations in the transmission curve increase with the number of atoms in the wire and the strength of the contact @xmath97 controls the amplitude of these oscillations .",

    "furthermore this wire is necessarily finite and the contact between the two leads can not be ignored . in this work",
    "we have investigated , on the one hand , the influence of structural ( stretching of a bond ) and magnetic ( domain wall ) defects on the transport properties of an infinite wire . on the other hand ,",
    "we have studied the contact effect , both in a @xmath136 model and in a more elaborated geometry in which the leads are represented by semi - infinite @xmath137 crystals ( see fig . [",
