    "the ligo laboratory has constructed three long - baseline laser interferometers whose object is the direct detection and subsequent study of gravitational radiation from astrophysical sources @xcite .",
    "the ligo interferometers are located at two sites in the u.s.a .",
    ", two interferometers of arm lengths 2 km and 4 km at the department of energy hanford site near hanford , washington , and a single 4 km arm length interferometer located in livingston parish , louisiana .",
    "we refer to these two observatories subsequently as hanford and livingston .",
    "figure [ fig : schematic ] shows greatly simplified schematics of the interferometers .",
    "the ligo detectors have been described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "each detector consists of a michelson interferometer with the two interferometer arms at right angles .",
    "each arm consists of a 2 or 4 kilometer long fabry - perot resonant cavity .",
    "a laser beam is split into two components which coherently excite one resonant mode of each fabry - perot cavity . at resonance , where the cavity length @xmath0 is a multiple of half the laser wavelength @xmath1 , there is no phase shift between the beam incident on the near - end mirror of each cavity and the beam passing back towards the beam splitter from this same near - end mirror . for small deviations , @xmath2 , from the resonant length ,",
    "the phase shift is linear in @xmath2 , as long as @xmath2 is small compared with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the finesse of the cavity .",
    "the ligo interferometers have @xmath5 and @xmath6 , so @xmath7 .",
    "the detectors are designed to be sensitive to gravitational waves in the frequency range 50  hz to 7  khz .",
    "gravitational waves passing through the detectors would cause oscillatory perturbations in components of the metric . consider first a simplified case , where the mirrors are freely floating , initially at fixed separation .",
    "metric perturbations due to gravitational waves would cause the lengths of the two fabry - perot cavities in each interferometer to oscillate in antiphase .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations from anticipated sources of gravitational waves are not known , but they are not expected to exceed @xmath8 .",
    "these oscillations would give rise to phase modulations of opposite signs in the light beams reflected from the near end of the two fabry - perot cavities back towards the beam splitter . by recombining these beams coherently at the beam splitter",
    ", we can measure the phase difference between them .",
    "the response of the ligo interferometers to gravitational waves is more complex than for the ideal case discussed above .",
    "each mirror is supported against the earth s gravitational field .",
    "the reaction forces in this support system must be taken into account in calibrating the response of the ligo interferometers to gravitational waves .",
    "secondly , the ligo interferometers utilize multiple feedback @xcite and feedforward @xcite control systems to minimize residual fluctuations in the lengths of the fabry - perot cavities .",
    "these control systems utilize electromagnetic actuators to exert forces on the ligo mirrors to ensure that fluctuations in the arm lengths over the full interferometer bandwidth are sufficiently small to maintain linearity of the interferometer and readout electronics .",
    "the reaction of these control systems to gravitational waves must also be accounted for in calibration of the interferometers @xcite .",
    "there are more stringent constraints on the magnitude of interferometer arm length fluctuations than the @xmath9 required to ensure linearity in the response of the phase of the recombined signal at the beam splitter to length fluctuations .",
    "the interferometer optics are configured for a light intensity at the output photodetectors commensurate with high sensitivity to the small arm length fluctuations expected from gravitational waves . in this configuration ,",
    "the photodetectors saturate for arm length fluctuations exceeding @xmath10 . furthermore , length fluctuations approaching this photodiode limit can result in excess noise in the gravitational wave band through bilinear coupling of laser amplitude and frequency noise into the interferometer .",
    "fluctuations in the arm lengths are maintained to within these stringent limits by the servo controls described above .",
    "a problem of great practical importance is _ lock acquisition _ , the process of bringing the mirrors from initially unconstrained motion on their supports , into a state where their residual motions are sufficiently small that the interferometer outputs are linear in changes in the arm lengths due to mirror displacements , and control systems are operating to maintain the resonant , high sensitivity state of the instrument @xcite .",
    "we refer to loss of this sensitive instrument state as _ lock loss_. when lock loss occurs , the interferometers are unuseable as gravitiational wave detectors until lock is re - acquired .",
    "the operation of the ligo interferometers is largely concerned with maintaining lock for the largest possible percentage of the time .",
    "a significant noise source for ligo is seismic noise in the ground acting through the mirror supports and shaking the mirrors . in order to be sensitive to gravitational waves ,",
    "the amplitude spectral density of noise fluctuations on the mirrors due to seismic noise over the 507000  hz band should be significantly less than the expected signal amplitude of @xmath11 .",
    "secondly , the root mean square ( r.m.s . )",
    "noise amplitude at each mirror over all frequencies should be significantly less than the @xmath12  m required to maintain lock .",
    "as part of the ligo scheme to meet these displacement noise requirements , each mirror support incorporates a multi - stage vibration isolation system .",
    "this system consists of a passive isolation stack @xcite in series with a steel wire , single loop pendulum for which the mirror substrate forms the suspended mass .",
    "both of these systems have natural resonant frequencies below the gravitational wave detection band .",
    "the 0.74  hz pendulum resonance is damped using a local feedback control system .",
    "the passive isolation stack has several resonances between 1 and 15hz , characterized by qs of about 1030 .    in this paper we present results of a long term study of seismic noise at the two ligo sites .",
    "the seismometer data recorded for this study reflect motion of the concrete slabs under the ligo optic support structures .",
    "the results given here are not intended as a study of the seismic environment in the ground .",
    "to reflect this , we use the terms slab velocity and slab motion throughout this paper to denote the measured ground velocity on the concrete floors of the ligo lab buildings , as opposed to measurements of ground velocity in a seismic vault that would be used by a geologist or geophysicist to study the geophysical properties of the local earth s crust .",
    "the data for this analysis were taken over a 613 day period between april 2nd 2001 and december 10th 2002 .",
    "the analysis focuses on the frequency band 0.110  hz .",
    "a central goal of this type of analysis is to study periodicities in the seismic environment at the sites and any correlations they might have with performance of the interferometers .",
    "it became clear during this analysis that slab noise in different parts of this frequency band was a good predictor of interferometer functionality .",
    "furthermore , this analysis has demonstrated conclusively that the seismic environment at the livingston interferometer is more challenging to ground - based gravitational wave interferometry than that at the hanford site .",
    "herein follows a brief summary of the location of each of the two ligo interferometer sites and environmental information about the two sites which is relevant to our analysis of the seismic data .",
    "the hanford interferometers are located on semi - arid shrub and grassland east of the cascade mountains in washington state on the columbia plateau , 370  km from the nearest point on the pacific coast . the vertex latitude and longitude of the hanford laboratory are @xmath13 n , @xmath14 w , and the x arm orientation is @xmath15 ( nw ) .",
    "the plateau rests on a sequence of volcanic basalt flows called the columbia river basalt group .",
    "these basalt formations are folded and faulted , and the resulting basins have filled with alluvial sedimentary deposits",
    ". the hanford interferometers rest on the sediment of one of the larger basins known as the pasco basin .",
    "the sediment depth exceeds the depth of the water table , which is approximately 120  m below the surface @xcite .",
    "the nearest substantial population centers to the site are the cities of richland , pasco , and kennewick , which in 2002 had a combined population of 124,000 @xcite .",
    "the three cities are 20 , 33 , and 35 kilometers from the ligo site . the ligo hanford laboratory is also located 15  km from sites 200e and 200w , facilities run by the department of energy which are currently carrying out extensive environmental cleanup operations which involve use of heavy earth moving machinery . the hanford site climatology is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the average annual rainfall 18  cm . during the summer months , the site is subject to strong day - night air temperature fluctuations . in july and august the maximum daytime and minimum nighttime temperatures are typically @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "strong wind gusts , which can cause increased motion of the concrete slabs supporting the ligo instruments , are observed .",
    "peak wind gusts speeds in a one month period are typically between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "gusts above @xmath20 are more frequent in the months january to april .    the livingston site is located in managed pine forest and more general forested land in southeastern louisiana , 54  km from the nearest point on lake ponchatrain , and 130  km from the nearest point on the gulf of mexico . the vertex latitude and longitude of the livingston laboratory are @xmath21 n , @xmath22 w , and the x arm orientation is @xmath23 ( wsw ) .",
    "the geology local to the site consists of silt , sand , and mud alluvium , deposited by the mississippi river .",
    "the bulk of this material was deposited before 2 million years ago when the gulf coast moved south to approximately its present position along with the bulk of new mississippi silt deposits .",
    "the water table is less than a meter below the ground , so the interferometer buildings rest on earth banking , consisting of the local silt and sand , raised several meters above the natural ground level .",
    "the livingston interferometer corner station is 7  km from the center of the town of livingston , which in 2000 had a population of 1,342 @xcite .",
    "climatological data is available from @xcite .",
    "the average annual rainfall in livingston parish is 152  cm .",
    "violent rain and windstorms occur frequently , especially during august and september .",
    "winter minimum and summer maximum temperatures are around @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "a particularly important environmental factor for seismic noise is the use of local land for timber harvesting .",
    "the heavy machinery used for logging adjacent to the site is a significant source of seismic noise for the interferometer .",
    "a second important environmental factor affecting seismic noise at the instruments is the passage of cargo trains along the railroad track 7 km to the south of the interferometer corner station .",
    "large trains that run past the site twice every evening currently disrupt the operation of the interferometer for around 40 minutes out of every day . for this paper we do not attempt to separate data from the livingston site into that taken during the passage of trains and that without .",
    "we present instead a broad statistical overview of the seismic environment over a long time period",

    "a long tail in the cumulative statistics from hanford implies that 5 to 10 percent of the time the hanford site is at least 80% as noisy as the livingston site .",

    "love waves are linearly polarized parallel to the plane of the earth s surface and perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave .",
    "therefore love waves produce only horizontal motion .",
    "assuming that the site slab motion can be decomposed into two components , due to rayleigh waves and love waves , we conclude that differences in the sources and the geology through which the waves have travelled to reach the sites cause the ellipticity of the rayleigh waves , the relative intensities of rayleigh to love waves , or a combination of these factors , to differ between the sites .",

    "the resolution bandwidth of the power spectra are too low to resolve this peak from the zero frequency component , so accurate estimates of the amplitude of annual modulation of the microseism can not be made without more data .",
