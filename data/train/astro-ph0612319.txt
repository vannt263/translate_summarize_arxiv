    "the thin solid angle explains the rare sn - grb connection and for instance the apparent grb990123 extraordinary power ( billions of times the typical sn luminosity ) .",

    "the statistical selection favors ( in wider volumes and for a wider sample of sn - grb - jet ) the harder and more on - axis events .",
    "a huge ( million time ) unobserved population of far off - axis sn - grbs at cosmic distances are below the detection thresholds .",
    "this amati correlation remains unexplained for any isotropic or fountain cone fireball model and it is in contrast with the cosmic trend required by the hubble - friedmann law : the further the distances , the larger the redshifts , the smoother the time lag profile and the softer the expected grb event",
    ".             in our model to make grb - sn in nearly energy equipartition the jet must be very collimated @xmath35-@xmath36 ( @xcite ) explaining why apparent ( but beamed ) grb luminosity @xmath37-@xmath16 erg @xmath28 coexist on the same place and similar epochs with lower ( isotropic ) sn powers @xmath38 . in order to fit the statistics between grb - sn rates ,",
    "the jet must have a decaying activity ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) : it must survive not just for the observed grb duration but for a much longer timescale , possibly thousands of time longer @xmath41 .",
    "the late stages of the grbs ( within the same decaying power law ) would appear as a sgrs .",
    "indeed the puzzle ( for one shot popular magnetar - fireball model@xcite ) arises for the surprising giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 that occurred on 2004 december 27th : if it has been radiated isotropically ( as assumed by the magnetar model@xcite ) , most of - if not all - the magnetic energy stored in the neutron star ns , should have been consumed at once .",
    "this should have been reflected into sudden angular velocity loss ( and - or its derivative ) which was _ never observed_. on the contrary a thin collimated precessing jet @xmath42-@xmath43 erg @xmath28 , blazing on - axis , may be the source of such an apparently ( the inverse of the solid beam angle @xmath44-@xmath45 ) huge bursts @xmath46 erg @xmath28 with a moderate steady jet output power ( x - pulsar , ss433 ) .",
    "this explains the absence of any variation in the sgr1806 - 20 period and its time derivative , contrary to any obvious correlation with the dipole energy loss law .",
    "the nearby spiralling of the jet to us explains the later bumping oscillatory signal of the event ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .         in our model , the temporal evolution of the angle between the spinnng ( psrs ) , precessing ( binary , nutating ) jet direction and the rotational axis of the ns , can be expressed as @xmath47 where @xmath48 @xmath49 and a similar law express the @xmath50 evolution .",
    "the angular velocities and phase labels are self - explained@xcite .",
    "lorentz factor @xmath0 of the jet s relativistic particles , for the most powerful sgr1806 - 20 event , and other parameters adopted for the jet model represented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are shown in the following table [ tab1 ] ( @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest way to produce the @xmath0 emission would be by ic of gevs electron pairs onto thermal infra - red photons .",
    "also electromagnetic showering of pev electron pairs by synchrotron emission in galactic fields , ( @xmath24 from muon decay ) may be the progenitor of the @xmath0 blazing jet .",
    "however , the main difficulty for a jet of gev electrons is that their propagation through the sn radiation field is highly suppressed .",
    "uhe muons ( @xmath51  pev ) instead are characterized by a longer interaction length either with the circum - stellar matter and the radiation field , thus they have the advantage to avoid the opacity of the star and escape the dense grb - sn isotropic radiation field @xcite .",
    "we propose that also the emission of sgrs is due to a primary hadronic jet producing ultra relativistic @xmath24 ( 1 - 10 pev ) from hundreds pev pions , @xmath52 , ( as well as eev neutron decay in flight ) : primary protons can be accelerated by the large magnetic field of the ns up to eev energy .",
    "the protons could in principle emit directly soft gamma rays via synchrotron radiation with the galactic magnetic field ( @xmath53 kev ) , but the efficiency is poor because of the too small proton cross - section , too long timescale of proton synchrotron interactions . by interacting with the local galactic magnetic field",
    "relativistic pair electrons lose energy via synchrotron radiation : @xmath54 with a characteristic timescale @xmath55 .",
    "this mechanism would produce a few hundreds kev radiation as it is observed in the intense @xmath0-ray flare from sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "the larmor radius is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the synchrotron interaction length and this may imply that the aperture of the showering jet is spread in a fan structure @xcite by the magnetic field , @xmath56 .",
    "therefore the solid angle is here the inverse of the lorentz factor ( @xmath14 nsr ) .",
    "in particular a thin ( @xmath57-@xmath58 sr ) precessing jet from a pulsar may naturally explain the negligible variation of the spin frequency @xmath59 after the giant flare ( @xmath60 hz ) .",
    "indeed it seems quite unlucky that a huge ( @xmath61 erg ) explosive event , as the needed mini - fireball by a magnetar model@xcite , is not leaving any trace in the rotational energy of the sgr 1806 - 20 , @xmath62 erg .",
    "the consequent fraction of energy lost after the flare is severely bounded by observations : @xmath63 .",
    "more absurd in magnetar - explosive model is the evidence of a brief precursor event ( one - second sn output ) taking place with no disturbance on sgr1806 - 20 _ two minutes before _ the hugest flare of 2004 dec .",
    "27th . the thin precessing jet while being extremely collimated ( solid angle @xmath44-@xmath36 ( @xcite ) may blaze at different angles within a wide energy range ( inverse of @xmath44-@xmath36 ) .",
    "the output power may exceed @xmath64 , explaining the extreme low observed output in grb980425 -an off - axis event- , the long late off - axis gamma tail by grb060218@xcite ) , respect to the on - axis and more distant grb990123 ( as well as grb050904 ) . * in conclusion _ grbs are not the most powerful explosions , but just the most collimated ones ."
