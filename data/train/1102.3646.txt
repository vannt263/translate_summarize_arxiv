    "blazars , characterized by their highly polarized emission in the optical band and strong variability at almost all frequencies , are often interpreted as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with relativistic jets beamed toward us ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "bl lac objects , which are a sub - class of blazars , typically exhibit weak or no spectral features in emission or absorption at all wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the very few weak absorption features detected in the optical band are believed to originate in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy ( e.g. , see @xcite ) and have been used to determine the redshift of the bl lac object .",
    "therefore , unlike the typical warm absorbers seen in agns , optical absorption lines in bl lac objects offer no information about the immediate environment of the central black holes .",
    "however , in the x - ray band , @xcite reported the first detection of an absorption feature in the spectrum of the bl lac object pks  2155 - 304 , using the objective grating spectrometer on the _ einstein observatory_. since then a number of x - ray absorption features have been reported ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , leading to the conclusion that such x - ray absorption features are quite common in the spectra of bl lac objects .",
    "these features were typically broad ( with a width of a few tens of ev up to a few hundred ev ) in the soft x - ray band , and were often interpreted as resonant absorption from highly ionized oxygen originating in a high velocity outflow ( up to a few 10,000 @xmath5 ) intrinsic to the bl lac object ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these discoveries demonstrate that x - ray absorption features can provide an extremely valuable probe of the central region of bl lac objects .    since the launch of the _ chandra _  and _",
    "xmm_-newton  x - ray telescopes , a number of bl lac objects have been observed with unprecedented high spectral resolution .",
    "however , so far no _ intrinsic _ x - ray absorption lines have been detected .",
    "non - intrinsic _ x - ray absorption features have been reported in these bl lac observations .",
    "but unlike previously detected features , when observed with high - resolution these features are typically narrower ( width of a few ev or less ) and often attributed to the foreground galactic ( e.g. , @xcite ) or intergalactic origins ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite  b09 hereafter ; @xcite  f10 hereafter ) . @xcite and @xcite examined a number of bright bl lac objects with _ xmm_-newton .",
    "they did not detect any broad features and argued the previous detections were affected by poor spectral quality , calibration uncertainties , as well as the simplification of the continuum model .",
    "although in @xcite they found a few highly significant features ( more than expected from statistic fluctuations ) , they were not able to find plausible identification of them , casting doubt on the existence of any absorption lines intrinsic to bl lac objects .    in this paper , we report the serendipitous detection of a transient absorption feature during our multiple observations of the bl lac object h  2356 - 309 with gratings on board the _ chandra _  and _",
    "xmm_-newton  x - ray telescopes .",
    "the primary science goal was to study the narrow absorption features produced by the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) along the sight line toward the bl lac object .",
    "we clearly detected an absorption line produced by the whim in the sculptor wall , a superstructure along the sight line at @xmath6 ( b09 , f10 ) . during one of the exposures ( observation # 10498 ) ,",
    "a strong absorption feature was identified at @xmath7  .  none of the other 11 _ chandra _  and _",
    "xmm_-newton  observations showed this feature . in this paper",
    "we discuss several possibilities of the origin of this transient feature , and conclude it is unlikely an instrumental feature .",
    "the most likely explanation is an intrinsic , transient feature produced by hydrogen - like oxygen .",
    "we also discuss the constraints on the temperature and ionization structure .",
    "h  2356 - 309 is a bl lac object located at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "multi - wavelength observations of this target showed its broad - band spectrum can be well described by the synchrotron self - compton emission from the relativistic jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "secondly , to account for the high - order contributions of the letg - hrc , we built a combined response matrix to include the first to the sixth - order contributions ( see b09 and f10 for details ) .",
    "finally , we rebinned the spectrum so that we have at least 40 counts per bin to enhance the spectral signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we fitted the continuum with a model that includes a power law and the galactic neutral hydrogen absorption and found this simple model is adequate in describing the overall broadband spectrum . for the observation # 10498",

    "the absorption feature seen at @xmath12   is an k@xmath1 absorption line produced by the whim gas in the sculptor wall ( see b09 and f10 ) .",
    "there is no known instrumental feature near this feature ( _ chandra _  proposers observatory guide , or pog ) .",
    "we examined both plus and minus orders and this feature is present in both sides with similar strength .",
    "the total exposure time of this observation is @xmath9 77 ksec .",
    "we also checked the consistency by splitting the exposure into two 38 ksec exposures , and we found this feature is consistently present in both exposures .",
    "we also checked the background spectrum and did not find any anomaly at this location that may have caused such an absorption feature .",
    "considering also the transient nature of this feature , we conclude that it is not instrumental in origin .    with the assumption that this feature is intrinsic to h  2356 - 309",
    ", we examine the possible ion species based on a combination of chemical abundance and line strength ( the oscillator strength @xmath13 ) . giving the detected wavelength , and assuming a very generous velocity range ( @xmath14 @xmath5 ) , the likely line transitions are @xmath15 at @xmath16  ,   at @xmath17  ,   at @xmath18  ,   at @xmath19  ,  and at @xmath20  .  here",
    "we select ion species with @xmath21 only . considering that both calcium and argon are orders of magnitude less abundant than oxygen , and we did not detect the corresponding @xmath22 transition",
    ", the most likely candidate is an intrinsic @xmath22 absorber in an outflow .",
    "we fitted the spectrum of the sequence # 10498 with a model that includes the following components : ( 1 ) galactic neutral hydrogen absorption with a fixed column density of @xmath23 @xmath24  @xcite ; ( 2 ) a power law ; ( 3 ) the whim and galactic @xmath22 absorption lines at 21.6 and 22.3  , respectively ( b09 and f10 ) ;  and ( 4 ) an intrinsic absorption line at @xmath9 22.05  .",
    "we fixed the component ( 3 ) - the galactic and the whim absorption lines - at the values obtained in f10 .",
    "we chose the voigt - profile based model that was described in b09 and f10 to fit the absorption feature ( 4 ) ; however , the exact form of the absorption line model is not important here , as long as the model can provide an adequate description of this feature .",
    "we limited the redshift range of this feature to account for an outflow velocity within @xmath25 @xmath5 ,  since most observed outflows from agns have velocities in the range of a few hundred to a few thousand @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "we performed the fit by minimizing the @xmath26-statistic , which is identical to maximizing the poisson likelihood function @xcite , and yields less biased best - fitting parameters than the standard @xmath27 implementation ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "figure  [ f : abs ] shows the # 10498 spectrum ( black ) and the fitted model ( red ) .",
    "the 22.05   line has an equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath28 m .",
    "we are not able to constrain the upper limit on the @xmath22 column density , and obtain a best - fit value of @xmath29 , with a lower limit of @xmath30 .",
    "the absorption feature is at a redshift of @xmath31 relative to the observer system .",
    "we also found a doppler-@xmath32 parameter of @xmath33 @xmath5 .",
    "thermal broadening can at most provide a @xmath32 parameter of up to @xmath34 @xmath5  ( for hot gas with temperatures up to a few @xmath35 k ) , indicating velocity gradient along the sight line plays a significant role in line broadening . if let free , both the galactic line at 21.6   and the whim line at 22.3   are statistically insignificant due to low photon counts .",
    "this is consistent with what we found in the other chandra observations ( see figure  2 of f10 ) : both lines are weak in each individual spectrum and can only be detected when all the observations are analyzed simultaneously .",
    "an accurate measurement of the bl lac redshift is necessary to determine the outflow velocity .",
    "based on the measurement of the optical absorption lines produced by the interstellar medium in the host galaxy , @xcite determined the redshift of h  2356 - 309 is @xmath8 .",
    "we find the measured redshifted of the @xmath22 absorption line is very consistent with that of h  2356 - 309 , with an outflow velocity of at most @xmath36 @xmath5 .",
    "we used monte - carlo simulations to assess the significance of this transient line .",
    "we fitted the # 10498 spectrum with a model that does not include the intrinsic line .",
    "when comparing with the fit that includes the intrinsic line , we found a decrease in the @xmath26-statistic of @xmath37 .",
    "this intrinsic line was discovered when we studied the 21 to 22.5   spectral region of 12 observations ( 11 _ chandra _  and one _ xmm_-newton ) .",
    "for the monte - carlo simulation in each trial we made 12 mock spectra in this spectral region to mimic the 12 observations . specifically , each mock spectrum was made with the model obtained from the real observation ( see f10 for model parameters ) but without any intrinsic line , i.e. , we used the same power law index , normalization , exposure time , and two absorption lines ( the galactic and the whim ) for that observation .",
    "we then searched each mock spectrum between 21 and 22.5   to identify any negative feature that could give a decrease of @xmath38 equal or larger than @xmath39 .",
    "we ran a total of 40,000 trials , and found for 38 trials , there is at least one mock spectrum with a change in @xmath38 that is equal to , or greater than what was observed .",
    "this indicates a detection significance of @xmath0 , or 99.9% confidence level , accounting for the number of `` trials '' .    when evaluating the detection significance we also fixed the galactic and the whim absorption lines at the values obtained in f10 . in principle",
    ", the two line parameters should be determined by a joint fit of all the 12 observations . however , such joint fit in our monte - carlo simulation is extremely computationally intensive , and our estimate indicated that the change in @xmath38 is negligible .",
    "therefore , we decided to fix these two line parameters in our calculation .",
    "we reiterate that the 2122.5   range is the appropriate wavelength region over which to perform the random trials to assess the statistical significance of the 22.05   line , because it was only from examining this limited wavelength range that , by chance , we discovered this transient line while studying the sculptor whim in f10 .",
    "however , for illustrative purposes only , we also computed the significance of this line by performing random trials over the entire 140   range and obtained a significance of 2.5@xmath40 , or 99.0% confidence . for comparison ,",
    "it is worth noting that if we search the entire 140   range for other features in the 12 spectra , the strongest features we find are 5 candidate lines where the decrease in the c - statistic is greater than 10 , with a maximum change of 15 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "these candidates are even less significant than the 22.05   line and , importantly , none of them are associated with ion species ( with strong oscillator strength ) appropriate for the milky way , the blazar , or the sculpor wall whim absorber .              considering the redshift of the @xmath22 absorption line , photonization by the central black hole of the blazar h  2356 - 309 likely plays a major role in ionizing the absorber .",
    "therefore , we have used the photonization code cloudy to determine its physical condition .",
    "calculations were performed with version 06.02 of cloudy , last described by @xcite .",
    "in general , photo - ionized gas achieves thermal equilibrium by balancing heating with cooling , where the major heating source is the ionizing photons from the central black hole , and the major cooling mechanism is collisionally excited , atomic and ionic line emission . at high temperatures , heating by compton scattering and cooling by thermal bremsstrahlung radiation and inverse compton scattering",
    "will become important . taking all these processes into consideration , we calculated the thermal equilibrium temperature as a function of the ionization parameter @xmath42 , using cloudy ( see figure  [ ionpara_t ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , this ionization parameter is defined as    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the luminosity of ionizing photons , @xmath45 is the distance of the absorber to the central source , @xmath46 is the gas density , @xmath47 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath48 is the gas temperature .. the conversion between this two definitions ( in c.g.s unit ) is : @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is temperature in units of @xmath51 k. ] for simplicity , we adopted a power law spectrum with a photon index of @xmath52 , obtained from our _ chandra _  spectrum , and also solar metallicity .",
    "we will discuss the impact of these choices later .    in figure  [ ionpara_t ]",
    ", cooling dominates over heating above the thermal equilibrium curve , and heating exceeds cooling below the curve . along the equilibrium curve , the gas is thermally stable in the green parts , and unstable in the red parts where the gradient becomes negative . in the unstable states",
    "a small increase in temperature will lead to regions where heating exceeds cooling and therefore becomes unstable .",
    "the stable states include one `` cold '' ( @xmath53 k ) , one `` hot '' ( @xmath54 k ) , and one intermediate state ( @xmath55 k ) .",
    "we also calculate the ionization fraction of both and , following @xcite .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ frac ] shows the ionization fraction of ( black line ) and ( red line ) as a function of the ionization parameter @xmath42 ; and the bottom panel of figure  [ frac ] shows the ionization fraction as a function of temperature .",
    "we do not detect the intrinsic @xmath22 line , and estimate a 3@xmath40 upper limit of the line equivalent width of @xmath56 m .",
    "this puts a tight lower limit of @xmath57 , and @xmath58 k. on the other hand , the derived column density is about a few @xmath59 @xmath24 .",
    "it is therefore highly unlikely that the ionization fraction of is much smaller than @xmath60 as this would imply a hydrogen column density much higher than @xmath61 @xmath24  even for solar abundance .",
    "this puts a tight constraint on the upper limit of @xmath62 , and @xmath63 k. figure  [ ionpara_t ] shows this allowed region in grey .",
    "the exact shape of the thermal equilibrium curve depends on assumptions such as the photon index of the incident spectrum and the metal abundance ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . a steeper spectrum ( e.g. , @xmath64 ) will lower the compton temperature at which compton heating and cooling balance each other , therefore lowering the temperature of the `` hot '' stable state in figure  [ ionpara_t ] .",
    "on the other hand , a change in the metal abundance will also result in a change in the peak positions of the thermal equilibrium curve because of the metal line cooling mechanism .",
    "however , our estimates indicate unless these assumptions change dramatically , they do not have significant impact on the estimated parameters ( ionization parameter , temperature , ionization fractions , etc . ) here .      the observation # 10497 was taken immediately before this observation and ended on september 20th , 2008 at about 10 am ; and the observation # 10762 was taken immediately after this observation and started on september 25th , 2008 at about 2 am",
    "this suggests the transient feature lasts at most @xmath65 seconds , and at least @xmath66 seconds .",
    "line variability is fairly common in the soft x - ray spectrum of agns .",
    "in particular , recent observations of agns with high resolution spectroscopy indicate narrow absorption lines can appear and vanish in time scales less than a few 100 ksec ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are two likely scenarios that an absorption line can become transient : ( 1 ) the ionization structure of the absorber changes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; or ( 2 ) the absorbing material changes , e.g. , moving in and out of the sight line ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we consider both scenarios in the following discussion .",
    "to change the physical state of the absorber during such a short period , either the ionizing source varies rapidly , or the absorber is in a physically unstable state .",
    "the source flux is extremely stable during our 500 ksec _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations that span about four months ( it varied at most about 30% ; see f10 ) . furthermore , one _ chandra _  and one _ xmm_-newton  observation performed about one year before these _ chandra _  observations showed variations about a factor of less than 2 ( b09 ) .",
    "hence , the source variation is unlikely to be the cause of this transient feature .    considering the possibility that the absorber becomes thermally unstable ( the red parts in figure  [ ionpara_t ] )",
    ", this intrinsic instability can lead to the transient nature of the absorber . in this case",
    ", the ionization structure can change rapidly if the photonization timescale is longer than the time interval @xmath67 .",
    "this photonization timescale can be estimated as    @xmath68^{-1}.\\ ] ]    here @xmath69 ( @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the spectral index ) is the ionizing photon flux , @xmath40 is the photonization cross section and @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the photonization threshold frequency , and @xmath74 is the planck constant . adopting the numbers for @xcite , we found @xmath75 .",
    "here @xmath76 is the distance to the absorber in units of pc , and @xmath77 is the ionizing luminosity in units of @xmath78 . for h  2356 - 309 , @xmath79 , the luminosity of the ionizing photons , is @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath81 , we found the distance of the absorber must be @xmath82 pc .",
    "this distance would put the absorbing material somewhere between the typical broad line region ( blr , sub - pc ) and narrow line region ( nlr , 10 pc  1 kpc ) of an agn .",
    "the density of the absorber then is    @xmath83    where @xmath50 is the temperature in units of @xmath51 k , and @xmath84 is the ionization parameter in units of 30 . taking the typical values for h  2356 - 309 ,",
    "the density is @xmath85 . with this density ,",
    "the typical recombination time scale , @xmath86 seconds , is also longer than @xmath67 .",
    "if instead the absorber is stable but moves in and out of the sight line between observations , then all the time scales must be shorter than @xmath87 .",
    "the absorber then has an upper limit on the distance of @xmath88 pc ( from @xmath89 ) , and a lower limit on the density of @xmath90 ( from @xmath91 ) .",
    "the column density is @xmath92 . assuming solar metallicity and an ionization fraction of 0.5 , the size of the absorber along the sight line is @xmath93 .",
    "if the absorber has a similar size in the perpendicular direction , it implies a light crossing time of @xmath94 seconds if the velocity in that direction is @xmath95 .",
    "since this time is less than @xmath87 , this scenario is also consistent with the data .",
    "we can also estimate the mass loss rate assuming a uniform spherically symmetric outflow @xcite :    @xmath96    here @xmath97 is the hydrogen mass , @xmath98 is the outflow velocity in units of 1,000 @xmath5 , and @xmath13 is the covering fraction and is roughly @xmath99  the fraction of observational time showing the line .",
    "this value is higher than those of seyfert galaxies which typically have weak outflows ( @xmath100 , e.g. , @xcite ) , but comparable to those agns with energetic jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the mass loss rate is likely smaller if it is beamed .",
    "such a radial outflow can produce a p cygni - type line profile typically seen in a stellar wind @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we do obtain a marginal detection of an emission feature on the long - wavelength side of the absorption feature , as expected from the p cygni profile ( see discussion below . )",
    "the p cygni - type of line profile was originally discovered in the optical and ultraviolet spectra of stellar objects , and is often attributed to the stellar wind ( e.g. , @xcite ) . with _",
    "chandra _ , the x - ray p cygni line was first detected in the spectrum of circinus x-1 , a galactic x - ray binary ( @xcite ) and , subsequently , it was also found in the x - ray spectra of active galactic nuclei ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "a p cygni - type of line profile provides an important diagnostic tool of whether the outflow is beamed with a jet - like structure or is more spherically extended .    in the observation",
    "# 10498 , we find a possible emission feature right next to the absorption feature on the long - wavelength side , resembling a p cygni - type profile .",
    "we fit this emission feature with a gaussian profile , along with an absorption profile on the short - wavelength side ( see figure  [ pc ] , plotted in the observer s frame ) .",
    "we find this is sufficient for fitting the absorption - emission feature at @xmath101  .",
    "using monte - carlo simulations as described in   3.1 , we found this feature is detected at the @xmath102 level .",
    "if this transient emission feature is @xmath103 and can be associated with the absorber , we measured an line flux of @xmath104 .",
    "the line emissivity peaks at about @xmath105 k. assuming a peak emissivity , we obtained an upper limit of the emission measure of @xmath106 at the distance of the bl lac . here",
    "@xmath107 is the electron density and the integration is over the emission volume .",
    "however , we consider the p cygni scenario unlikely since if the @xmath108 as we estimated for the absorber , the linear size of the emission material ( @xmath9 0.4 pc ) would be far greater than that of the absorber . clearly , more sophisticated modeling is necessary to fully understand the structure and physical properties of this material as revealed by the emission / absorption profile .",
    "the transient nature of this absorption feature makes it very unlikely to be produced by the ism in the host galaxy , an intervening absorber , or a local absorber .",
    "we do notice that the observed wavelength of this feather is very close to the rest wavelength of the @xmath22 inner shell transition ( @xmath109  , see @xcite ) .",
    "this @xmath22 inner shell transition was first reported in @xcite in the x - ray spectrum of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "x - ray observations of narrow absorption features offer a unique opportunity to probe the inner region of bl lac objects . in this paper",
    "we report the detection of a transient absorption line during our h  2356 - 309 campaign with the _ chandra _  x - ray telescope .",
    "this line is most likely produced by in a photo - ionized outflow intrinsic to the bl lac object h  2356 - 309 . considering the transient nature of the absorber ,",
    "we obtain constrains on the absorber s ionization parameter , @xmath2 , temperature , @xmath3 k , and density , a few @xmath110 .",
