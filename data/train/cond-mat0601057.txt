    "the advent of microscopic solvability theory @xcite in the 1980s lead to the prediction that the anisotropy of the excess free - energy of the crystal - melt interface is a crucial parameter that determines the growth rate and morphology of dendrites , which shape the microstructures of many commercial metallic alloys .",
    "this prediction was largely validated by phase - field simulations @xcite of dendritic solidification during the 1990s .",
    "more recent work in the present decade has focused on the quantitative prediction of both the magnitude and the anisotropy of the interfacial free - energy @xmath0 using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . in parallel",
    ", experimental progress has been made to determine this anisotropy in metallic systems from accurate equilibrium shape measurements @xcite , which extend pioneering measurements of this anisotropy in transparent organic crystals @xcite .",
    "md - based methods , including the cleaving technique @xcite and the capillary fluctuation method ( cfm ) @xcite , have been successfully developed to compute @xmath0 and to accurately resolve its notoriously small anisotropy of the order of @xmath5 .",
    "these methods have been applied to a wide range of systems , including several elemental face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) @xcite , body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) @xcite , and hexagonal - close - packed @xcite metals , as well as one fcc metallic alloy @xcite modeled with interatomic potentials derived from the embedded - atom - method ( eam ) , the lennard - jones system @xcite , hard - sphere @xcite and repulsive power - law potentials @xcite , and , most recently , a bcc molecular organic succinonitrile @xcite used extensively in experimental studies of crystal growth patterns .    in systems with an underlying cubic symmetry ,",
    "the magnitude of the crystalline anisotropy has been traditionally characterized by comparing the values of @xmath0 corresponding to @xmath6 and @xmath3 crystal faces .",
    "md calculations have yielded anisotropy values @xmath7 , and experimental values extracted from equilibrium shape measurements fall generally within this range .",
    "what determines physically the positive sign and the magnitude of this anisotropy , however , remains unclear .",
    "one interesting clue is that md - calculated anisotropies generally depend more on the crystal structure than on the microscopic details of inter - molecular forces for the same crystal structure , and anisotropies tend to be consistently smaller for bcc than for fcc @xcite .",
    "a striking example of the former is the fact that md studies of fe @xcite and succninonitrile @xcite , with the same bcc structure but entirely different inter - molecular forces , have yielded comparable anisotropies around half a percent .",
    "the weaker anisotropy of @xmath0 for bcc compared to fcc is also consistent with experimental measurements of anisotropy values in the range of @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the bcc and fcc transparent organic crystals succinonitrile and pivalic acid , respectively @xcite .",
    "the fact that anisotropy appears to depend more strongly on crystal structure than inter - molecular forces suggests that it may be possible to predict this critical parameter from a continuum density wave description of the solid - liquid interface , which naturally incorporates anisotropy because of the broken symmetry of the solid .",
    "the simplest of such descriptions is the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory of the bcc - liquid interface developed by shih _",
    "the order parameters of this theory are the amplitudes of density waves corresponding to the set of principal reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath10 , and the free - energy functional is derived from density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite with certain simplifying assumptions .",
    "this theory has yielded predictions of @xmath0 for various bcc elements that are in reasonably good agreement with experiments .",
    "moreover , it has provided an elegant analytical derivation of the proportionality between @xmath0 and the latent heat of fusion , in agreement with the scaling relation @xmath11 proposed by turnbull @xcite and recently corroborated by md simulations @xcite , where @xmath12 is the solid atomic density and @xmath13 is the latent hear per atom .",
    "this theory , however , predicts the wrong ordering @xmath4 . this apparent failure could be due to the truncation of larger @xmath14 modes , i.e. density waves corresponding to reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "however , paradoxically , a strong dependence of the anisotropy on larger @xmath15 modes would be hard to reconcile with the weak dependence of this quantity on details of inter - molecular forces seen in md studies , since these forces dictate the amplitudes of these modes in the crystal where the density is sharply peaked around atomic positions .    to shed light on this paradox",
    ", we revisit the simplest gl theory of the bcc - liquid interface based on the minimal set of principal reciprocal lattice vectors .",

    "_ @xcite in the derivation of the coefficients of the gradient square terms in the gl free - energy functional .",

    "_ choose these coefficients to be proportional to the number of principal reciprocal lattice vectors in each subset .",
    "this procedure , however , turns out to yield an incorrect directional dependence ( i.e. dependence on @xmath18 ) of the rate of decay of density waves into the liquid .",
    "here we find that the inclusion of the correct directional dependence , as prescribed by dft , yields the correct ordering @xmath1 and a reasonable estimate of the magnitude of anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , we validate this directional dependence by md computations of density wave profiles .",
    "we review the derivation of the gl theory and compare our results to md simulations in the next section .",
    "the theory is derived in the dft framework where the free energy of an inhomogeneous system is expressed as a functional @xmath19 $ ] of its density distribution @xmath20 , which can be expanded in the form @xmath21 where the order parameters @xmath22 s are the amplitudes of density waves corresponding to principle lattice vectors @xmath23 of the reciprocal fcc lattice , and the contribution of larger @xmath15 mode denoted by @xmath24 is neglected .",
