    "as in other galaxy groups , also the dwarf galaxies inhabiting the local group can be broadly divided in two categories , late- and early - types , on the basis of the presence or absence of both gas and current star formation , respectively .",
    "it is still a question whether these morphological types share similar ancestors and owe their distinct properties at redshift zero to a different evolutionary path , or whether their `` destiny '' as a late- or early - type system was somewhat imprinted in the conditions at their formation .",
    "the fact that local group late- and early - type dwarfs share similar scaling relations ( see for a recent review ) , appear to follow the same stellar mass - metallicity relation ( ( * ? ? ? * kirby et al . 2013 ) ) but inhabit clearly different environments - with late - types found in isolation and early - types in general satellites of the large local group spirals - hints to environmental effects being relevant for the evolution of these galaxies .    on the basis of lifetime star formation histories from very deep colour - magnitude - diagrams , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gallart et al.(2015 ) ) propose the existence of two main types of dwarf galaxies : _ slow dwarfs _",
    ", i.e. those that have formed stars at a relatively low rate for the whole life of the system , and _ fast dwarfs _ ,",
    "i.e. those that have experienced most of their star formation activity in the first gyrs of evolution",
    ". late - type systems map into _ slow dwarfs _ , but this is not always the case for early - type and _ fast- _ dwarfs .",
    "gallart et al .",
    "propose that the two evolutionary paths are imprinted from the start and related to the environment in which the dwarfs were born .",
    "the spectroscopic study of the evolved stellar component of dwarf galaxies offers a complementary perspective , as for local group galaxies it is possible to determine metallicities and line - of - sight velocities for individual stars , and hence study their internal kinematics and metallicity properties in detail and out to large radii .",
    "red giant branch stars are particularly interesting targets , because they probe a very large range of ages , from @xmath01.5gyr to the early star formation episodes .",
    "being very luminous , they are within reach of current spectrographs on 8m-10 m telescopes for galaxies to within @xmath01 mpc .",
    "here we present preliminary results from our vlt / fors2 mxu spectroscopic survey of rgb stars in the phoenix transition type ( dt ) .",
    "this system is as luminous as a typical `` classical '' spheroidal , but found at a distance of @xmath0400kpc from the milky way , hence it can provide an interesting view of the properties of low mass dwarf galaxies that have mostly evolved in isolation .",
    "we obtained vlt / fors2 mxu spectroscopic data for the phoenix dt in service mode ( programme 083.b-0252 ; pi : battaglia ) .",
    "we used the 1028z grism in combination with the og590 + 32 order separation filter ( wavelength coverage 7730 - 9480 ) ; the slits were set to have a width=1  for a final resolving power of r@xmath02500 .",
    "we obtained 11 pointings in which we allocated slits to a total of @xmath1 pre - selected red giant branch ( rgb ; i@xmath2mag ) stars from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* battaglia et al.(2012 ) ) that cover a total area of roughly @xmath3 across the field of the galaxy .",
    "in addition to these data , we use vlt / fors2 mxu spectra for  30 stars in a central pointing ( programme 71.b-0516 ; pi : cole ) .",
    "the data reduction and extraction of the spectra was performed with standard iraf procedures , together with custom made idl scripts .",
    "we extracted line - of - sight velocities ( v@xmath4 ) and equivalent widths ( ews ) from the ca  ii triplet ( cat ) nir lines .",
    "line - of - sight velocities were obtained by cross - correlating the continuum normalized spectra with a synthetic spectrum derived from a stellar atmospheric model with similar parameters as expected for the phx targets .",
    "the ews were determined by fitting a voigt profile and transformed into [ fe / h ] using the calibration from .",
    "the cat [ fe / h ] was validated against two calibrating globular clusters ; these were also used to test the accuracy of the v@xmath4 determination , together to phx stars overlapping among different masks . the median error in v@xmath4",
    "is 8 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the sample of probable phoenix members among the two observing programmes consists of @xmath0190 stars , as indicated by the stars position on the colour - magnitude - diagram and radial velocity .",
    "we obtain a systemic l.o.s . velocity equal to -21.2@xmath61.0 km s@xmath5 and a dispersion of 9.3@xmath60.7 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the systemic velocity is consistent with the determination of -13@xmath69 km s@xmath5 obtained by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* irwin & tolstoy ( 2002 ) ) from a much smaller sample of 7 stars and in excellent agreement with the velocity of the hi cloud ( -23 km s@xmath5 ) proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* st - germain et al.(1999 ) ) as physically associated to phoenix .",
    "it is well - known that dwarf galaxies inhabiting dense environments such as within the virial radii of the milky way or m31 are devoid of gas , except for relatively massive systems such as e.g. for the magellanic clouds or ic  10 .",
    "the fact that such a small system as phoenix has been able to form stars until almost present day ( ( * ? ? ? * hidalgo et al . 2009 ) ) and still contains gas , together with its large distance and velocity direction approaching the milky way ( v@xmath7 km s@xmath5 ) , strongly suggests that phoenix is still to enter the milky way virial radius for the first time and has evolved undisturbed from interactions with large galaxies .",
    "interestingly , the metallicity properties of this system appear alike to those of similarly luminous dwarf spheroidal galaxies satellites of the milky way , which are devoid of gas and are found in a higher density environment . in particular we detect a clear negative , approximately linear [ fe / h ] gradient ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , whose slope compares well to those of milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* leaman et al . 2013 ) ) .",
    "this finding leads us to speculate that metallicity gradients in these small dwarf galaxies are likely to be driven by internal mechanisms rather than by environmental ones , although this conclusion needs to be put on a more secure foot by similar spectroscopic surveys of larger samples of local group dwarf galaxies inhabiting different environments .",
    "the detailed metallicity and kinematic properties of phoenix from the vlt / fors2 mxu sample here presented will be discussed in kacharov et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    "we are grateful to a.cole for useful discussions and for providing the reduced vlt / fors2 data from program 71.b-0516 ."
