    "the recognised convention for representing the overall galaxy population is the luminosity distribution or space density of galaxies ( see review by binggeli , sandage & tammann 1988 and more recently @xcite ) .",
    "this distribution is typically derived from a magnitude limited redshift survey which is corrected for malmquist bias ( e.g. , efstathiou , ellis & peterson 1988 ) and fitted with the three parameter schechter function @xcite .",
    "generally , the schechter function is found to be a formally good representation , although some surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) have hinted at an upturn at the faintest limits , where the statistics become poor ( typically @xmath25  mag , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the process of fitting a luminosity function ( lf ) reduces the galaxy population to three crucial numbers : the characteristic luminosity , @xmath10 ( or @xmath26 ) , the normalisation , @xmath27 , and the faint - end slope , @xmath28 .    since the pioneering work of @xcite numerous measurements of these three crucial parameters have been made ( see @xcite ) . among the most recent are those derived from the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss1&2 ; @xcite ; 2003a ) .",
    "however , although individual surveys yield schechter function parameters to high accuracy , a comparison between independently published values shows excessively large variations , indicative of strong systematic errors ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "discuss the impact of surface brightness selection effects on measurements of the lf ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) and find that such effects _ may _ provide an explanation for the variation seen .",
    "in @xcite we compared a number of recent @xmath24-band schechter function values and used the precision number counts of the millennium galaxy catalogue  with a uniform isophotal detection limit of @xmath29  mag  arcsec@xmath1  in the @xmath24-band  to revise the normalisation parameters .",
    "this resulted in a reasonably consistent global schechter function with : @xmath30  mag , @xmath31  mpc@xmath7 and @xmath32 ( taken from @xcite ) .    despite the apparent convergence brought about by @xcite there are two strong reasons to now go beyond the monovariate schechter function :    \\(1 ) numerical and semi - analytic simulations are sufficiently developed that it is now possible to predict not just the luminosity distribution but also the size distribution ( see e.g.  @xcite ; buchalter , jimenez & kamionkowski 2001 ; @xcite ) and hence the _ bivariate _ distribution of luminosity and size ( or luminosity and surface brightness , see e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this bivariate brightness distribution ( bbd ) can be fitted by a 6-parameter chooniewski function @xcite  essentially a schechter function with a luminosity dependent gaussian distribution in surface brightness ( see e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite )  or compared directly without confinement by any functional form .",
    "either way , a multivariate distribution provides a more stringent constraint than the monovariate schechter function ( see also @xcite ) ;    \\(2 ) @xcite essentially circumvent the surface brightness issues raised by @xcite by allowing the normalisation of the lfs to accommodate the missing flux from low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "this approximation succeeds because the galaxies that dominate the bright galaxy number counts are all around the @xmath26 value , where the surface brightness distribution appears well defined ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we also know from studies of giant ellipticals ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , disk galaxies ( @xcite ) , dwarf galaxies in the local group ( @xcite ) , rich clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and from early work on the global field bbd ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) that there exists a luminosity surface brightness relation ( see also @xcite for the near - ir relation and a discussion of its variation with wavelength ) .",
    "together these imply that the impact of surface brightness selection effects will be a function of luminosity . therefore recovering the full luminosity distribution",
    "can only be done by simultaneously considering luminosity _ and _ surface brightness ",
    "a conclusion reached many times over the past half - century ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "an additional motivation is that given the size of contemporary datasets , it becomes logical to start to explore multivariate distributions to quantify trends such as the luminosity - surface brightness relation @xcite or the colour - luminosity relation ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .    here",
    "we reconstruct the bivariate luminosity - surface brightness distribution with careful attention to the impact of surface brightness and size selection effects . in section  [ data ]",
    "we describe the imaging and redshift data . in section  [ cosmoke ]",
    "we describe the conversion of our catalogue from apparent to absolute properties , the various selection boundaries and our methodology for deriving the joint luminosity - surface brightness distribution .",
    "we apply it to our data in section  [ mgcbbd ] and compare our results to previous estimates of the bbd ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the lf ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the surface brightness or size distribution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we summarise our key results in section  [ conclusions ] . throughout",
    "we assume @xmath33 as defined in section  [ cosmology ] .",
    "the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc ) is a deep ( @xmath34  mag  arcsec@xmath1 ) , wide - field ( @xmath35  deg@xmath36 ) @xmath24-band imaging survey obtained with the wide field camera on the 2.5-m isaac newton telescope .",
    "the survey region is a long , 35-arcmin wide strip along the equator , covering from @xmath37 to @xmath38 ( j2000 ) , and is fully contained within the regions of both the 2dfgrs and sdss data release 1 ( dr1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite we gave a detailed description of the observations , reduction , object detection , galactic extinction correction and classification ( using sextractor ; @xcite ) and presented precision galaxy number counts over the range @xmath39  mag . all non - stellar sources to @xmath40  mag were visually inspected and if an object was found to be incorrectly deblended or if the object s parameters were obviously wrong , the object was re - extracted by manually changing the sextractor extraction parameters until a satisfactory result was achieved . in addition , all low - quality regions in the survey ( e.g.  near ccd defects ) were carefully masked out ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we demonstrated that the internal photometric accuracy of the mgc is @xmath41  mag and that the astrometric accuracy is @xmath42  arcsec .",
    "in @xcite we then compared the photometric accuracy , completeness and contamination of the mgc to the 2dfgrs and sdss - edr and dr1 datasets .",
    "being deeper and of higher resolution , we found that the mgc is both more accurate and more complete than either of these surveys .",
    "the mgc is currently the highest quality and most complete representation of the nearby galaxy population .",
    "[ mgcexamples ] shows images of three galaxies from the digital sky survey ( left ) , the sdss ( centre ) and the mgc ( right ) , illustrating the superior resolution and greater depth of the mgc data .",
    "the mgc - bright catalogue of @xcite was bounded at the bright end by @xmath43  mag , where stars begin to flood in our best seeing fields .",
    "we now extend this catalogue brightwards to @xmath44  mag by carefully examining all non - stellar objects in the range @xmath45  mag , repairing objects that had been over - deblended by sextractor and checking completeness with ned at @xmath46  mag , where sextractor ",
    "optimised for faint galaxy detection and photometry  may occasionally miss very large objects .",
    "a second change to mgc - bright with respect to @xcite is the deletion of some exclusion regions .",
    "liske et al .",
    "had placed exclusion regions around very bright objects ( @xmath47  mag ) to avoid spurious halo detections and problems with background estimation in their vicinity .",
    "@xmath48 such regions had been erroneously placed around galaxies fainter than @xmath49  mag and these have been deleted , resulting in an increase of the good - quality survey area from @xmath50 to @xmath35  deg@xmath36 .",
    "further minor changes were introduced to mgc - bright , each affecting @xmath51tens of objects : different deblending decisions ; spectroscopic identification of galaxies previously misclassified as stars ( compact emission line galaxies ) and vice versa ( stars which appear extended because of almost perfect alignment with small , faint background galaxies ) ; and identification of asteroids previously misclassified as galaxies ( discovered by comparison with sdss - dr1 imaging data ) .",
    "the final mgc - bright sample now comprises @xmath2 galaxies .        by design the mgc survey region",
    "is fully contained within the 2dfgrs and sdss survey regions .",
    "hence we first turned to these surveys in order to obtain redshifts for mgc - bright .",
    "in addition we obtained redshifts from the 2qz @xcite , ned ( excluding 2dfgrs and sdss objects ) and the smaller surveys of francis , nelson & cutri ( 2004 ) ( pf ) and @xcite ( lsbg ) . in turn each survey , @xmath52 , was matched against mgc galaxies and stars with @xmath53  mag .",
    "this magnitude limit and the following matching procedure were chosen in order to be able to account for every @xmath52 object and hence to verify the completeness of the mgc .     objects with multiple redshift measurements .",
    "the distribution has an rms dispersion of @xmath54  km  s@xmath55 .",
    "the solid line is a gaussian with the same median and rms as the data . ]",
    "first we found all pairs of @xmath52 and mgc objects where each is identified as the other s nearest neighbour in that catalogue .",
    "a pair with separation @xmath56 smaller than some @xmath57 is classified as a match unless one or more other mgc objects have also identified the @xmath52 object as their nearest neighbour in @xmath52 with a separation @xmath58 ( where @xmath56 refers to the separation of the closest pair ) .",
    "these @xmath52 objects as well as objects with @xmath59 and those which have not been identified as a nearest neighbour by any mgc objects are classified as initially unmatched .",
    "the value of @xmath60 is chosen as the separation where the invariably occurring tail in the distribution of separations begins to dominate .    the above definition of initially unmatched objects is designed to conservatively flag all possible mismatches .",
    "almost all mismatches fall into one of three categories , which are a priori difficult to distinguish from one another but for which one needs to proceed differently : ( i ) unusually large positional disagreement ; ( ii ) two ( or more ) objects in one catalogue where the other catalogue only has one object , because of different deblending choices or different resolution ; ( iii ) one object in @xmath52 but none in mgc because of inaccurate photometry in either @xmath52 or mgc , or because the @xmath52 object is an asteroid or a spurious noise detection , or because the object is genuinely missing from the mgc .",
    "all initially unmatched objects are visually inspected in order to reliably identify those objects that were in fact correctly matched .",
    "the few cases where the mismatch was due to poor object extraction in the mgc were fixed .",
    "each redshift of a matched object is assigned a redshift quality , @xmath61 , which has the same meaning as in the 2dfgrs @xcite : @xmath62 means no redshift could be measured ; @xmath63 means possible but doubtful redshift ; @xmath64 means probable redshift ; and @xmath65 or @xmath66 means good or very good redshift . @xmath62 and @xmath67 are considered failures and we will use only redshifts with @xmath68 in this paper .",
    "in addition to the 2dfgrs this system is also already used by pf .",
    "we translate the various quality parameters of the other surveys to our system in the following manner : sdss - dr1 redshifts are assigned @xmath65 unless the sdss zstatus or zwarning flags indicate a serious problem ; for the 2qz we use @xmath69 ; and ned and lsbg redshifts are assigned @xmath64 .    in total the public data provided good quality redshifts for @xmath70 mgc galaxies .      in order to complete the redshifts for the full mgc - bright sample we conducted our own redshift survey ( which we label mgcz ) , targeting those galaxies which did not already have publicly available redshifts .",
    "these observation were mainly carried out with the two degree field ( 2df ) facility on the anglo australian telescope .",
    "the data were collected , reduced and redshifted in an identical manner to that of the 2dfgrs ( see @xcite for full details ) . in particular",
    "we again used the same redshift quality parameter , @xmath61 , as the 2dfgrs ( see above ) .",
    "the redshift incompleteness of the 2df data showed a clear bias against low - surface brightness galaxies .",
    "hence we undertook additional single - object long - slit observations , targeting low - surface brightness galaxies ( @xmath71  mag  arcsec@xmath1 , where @xmath72 is the apparent effective surface brightness within the half - light radius , see section  [ mgcsb ] ) as well as gaps in our 2df coverage , with the double beam spectrograph ( dbs ) on the australian national university s @xmath73-m , the low resolution spectrograph ( lrs ) on the @xmath74-m telescopio nazionale galileo on la palma , the eso multi - mode instrument ( emmi ) on the new technology telescope in la silla and the gemini multiple object spectrograph ( gmos , long - slit nod & shuffle mode ) on gemini north . in all cases we observed between @xmath75 and @xmath76  s through a @xmath77 to @xmath67-arcsec wide slit , aligning the slit with the major axis of the object to collect as much flux as possible .",
    "all the data were reduced in a similar manner using standard iraf procedures .",
    "the resulting spectra are of similar resolution as our 2df data , but of higher quality : they increased our redshift completeness at @xmath78  mag and @xmath71  mag  arcsec@xmath1  from @xmath79 to @xmath80 per cent .",

    "however this appears to be a further manifestation of the sdss use of circular apertures .",
    "for example , if we derive the surface brightness distribution around the @xmath10-point for the mgc data using circular and major axis derived surface brightness measures we find a peak offset of @xmath302 ( slightly larger than our estimated median offset of @xmath262 ) with @xmath303 and @xmath304 .",
    "this latter value is now consistent with the recent sdss estimate ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that the dashed lines on fig .",
    "[ sbgauss ] indicated the sdss extrapolated data used to correct the faint - end of the luminosity function . to the mgc limit",
    "these extrapolated distributions appear to match our data well providing some vindication for the extrapolation process ( see @xcite , section [ llfe ] and fig .  [ guesstimate ] ) .",
    "the above two comparison between the mgc and the @xcite and @xcite studies must imply an inconsistency between the two sdss results .",
    "this is perhaps more obvious if one bypasses the mgc data and directly compare fig .  14 of shen et al with fig .  5 of blanton et al .",
    "the peaks of the late - type / low sersic index sb distributions ( both measured in @xmath240 ) are clearly distinct . given the consistency with the 2dfgrs and the traditional structural studies discussed earlier we conclude that the problem most likely lies with the shen et al . analysis .",
    "if we disregard the shen et al study , we can conclude that the ridge line of the effective surface brightness distribution is well constrained and consistent between the mgc , 2dfgrs and the most recent sdss results .",
    "however the mgc distribution is significantly broader than either the 2dfgrs or sdss results which is due to improvements in the analysis ( in comparison to the 2dfgrs ) and the use of elliptical as opposed to circular aperture photometry ( in comparison to the sdss ) .      in section [ evolution ]",
    "we described our adopted evolutionary parameter , @xmath142 , where the luminosity evolution follows the form : @xmath305 $ ] . in section [ sdssdiff ]",
    "we saw that this evolution differs from that adopted by the 2dfgrs and sdss2 and discussed the possible impact .",
    "[ beta ] ( upper panels ) highlights this dependency by showing the derived values for @xmath10 and @xmath28 for various values of @xmath142 . taking this one step",
    "further we can attempt to constrain @xmath142 directly by adopting the additional constraint that the recovered @xmath10 parameter should be invariant to redshift .",
    "we divide our sample into two redshift intervals : @xmath306 and @xmath307 ( with median redshifts of @xmath308 and @xmath309 respectively ) and redetermine the collapsed lf distributions using our bbd analysis for regular intervals of @xmath142 .",
    "we hold @xmath28 fixed to the value derived from the full redshift range for each @xmath142 ( i.e. , the value indicated in the middle panel of fig .  [ beta ] ) and",
    "solve for @xmath10 and @xmath27 .",
    "it is necessary to hold @xmath28 fixed because the high-@xmath102 sample has too few low - luminosity galaxies to adequately constrain it .",
    "[ beta ] ( main panel ) shows the resulting @xmath310 versus @xmath142 and we find the weak constraint : @xmath311 . while this is not particularly stringent , it is consistent with our adopted value of @xmath312 .",
    "this constraint on beta is marginally inconsistent ( @xmath313 ) with the evolution found by @xcite for the @xmath241-band ( @xmath314 ) , but consistent with the evolution adopted by the 2dfgrs ( @xmath315 ) .",
    "perhaps more importantly this range of @xmath142 implies a potential systematic uncertainty on the quoted @xmath10 ( @xmath28 ) values of @xmath316 ( @xmath317 ) . as noted at the start of section [ cosmoke ] , it is also equally plausible that this error does not actually reflect evolution per se but could instead be interpreted as a redshift dependent photometric error or similar .     from the variation of @xmath10 between low and high redshift samples .",

    "in this paper we have attempted to recover the space density and surface brightness distributions of galaxies , paying careful attention to surface brightness selection biases .",
    "we have used the millennium galaxy catalogue which , although smaller in size , has significantly higher resolution , greater depth and higher redshift completeness than either the 2dfgrs or sdss datasets , hence probing to fainter intrinsic luminosities . in comparison to most earlier studies this work includes the following enhancements .",
    "\\1 . imaging data which probes @xmath277@xmath67  mag  arcsec@xmath1  deeper than the 2dfgrs and sdss surveys",

    "\\7 . a joint luminosity - surface brightness step - wise maximum likelihood method which incorporates the selection boundaries .",
    "having incorporated these additional improvements to the classical measurement of galaxy luminosity functions , we generally find close agreement with previous results . in particular , our collapsed luminosity distribution is marginally higher in normalisation and marginally flatter than the 2dfgrs @xcite , esp @xcite and sdss1 ( @xcite ; after renormalisation by @xcite ) results .",
    "it is significantly brighter and steeper than the more recent sdss2 luminosity function @xcite .",
    "we infer that this discrepancy arises because of a colour - selection bias in the sdss .",
    "the mgc survey extends to lower luminosity than these previous surveys , providing more leverage and hence more reliability at the faint end .",
    "our final schechter function parameters are : @xmath319  mpc@xmath7 , @xmath320  mag and @xmath9 with a @xmath321 of @xmath322 indicating a respectable fit .",
    "overall we find that surface brightness selection effects do not play a significant role at bright luminosities .",
    "however , the combination of the luminosity - surface brightness relation and the broadening of the surface brightness distribution is likely to lead to the loss of both low surface brightness and compact dwarf systems in contemporary surveys  hence the variation in @xmath28 ( cf .",
    "[ lfcomp ] &  [ lfcomp2 ] and discussion in section [ spacedensity ] ) . at the very faint end",
    "we provide lower limits which suggest that the luminosity function must turn up at some point faintwards of @xmath323  mag .      the final mgc schechter function parameters , which include compensation for the effects of selection bias , imply a luminosity density of @xmath325  mpc@xmath7 ( adopting @xmath326 mag and @xmath327 , cf .",
    "this is fully consistent with the mgc revised values for the 2dfgrs , esp and sdss1 surveys ( see table 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that this value is also consistent with the original 2dfgrs ( @xcite ) and esp ( @xcite ) values .",
    "the more recent sdss2 result ( @xcite ) finds @xmath328  mpc@xmath7 and @xmath329  mpc@xmath7 .",
    "hence while the @xmath12 value is consistent the @xmath13 value is not ( @xmath330 ) .",
    "the sdss @xmath13 value is derived by adopting the evolutionary parameters derived by @xcite .",
    "if we use our evolution instead ( @xmath138 , see section  [ evolution ] ) the sdss @xmath13 luminosity density becomes @xmath331  mpc@xmath7 which although closer is also inconsistent with our result . from section  [ sdssdiff ]",
    "we concluded that a colour bias may have resulted in an underestimate of the sdss @xmath241-band lf and hence to an underestimate of the sdss luminosity densities .",
    "based on the consistency between the mgc , 2dfgrs and esp results we can also find that while the more sophisticated bbd analysis does recover some additional flux from the low surface brightness population , it does not constitute a significant change ( consistent with the findings of @xcite ) .",
    "our recovered bivariate brightness distribution exhibits a clear ` ridge ' of data well separated from the selection boundaries down to @xmath332  mag at which point both very compact and highly extended dwarf systems will be missed .",
    "this indicates that the recovered schechter function is generally robust to surface brightness selection effects for luminous galaxies but that the dwarf population(s ) remain elusive .",
    "we attempted to fit a chooniewski function @xcite , essentially a schechter function with a gaussian distribution in surface brightness , to the overall distribution .",
    "it introduces three additional parameters : a characteristic surface brightness ; a gaussian dispersion ; and a luminosity surface brightness relation .",
    "we find that this function fails to provide a satisfactory fit due to the broadening of the surface brightness distribution with decreasing luminosity and a distinct change in slope of the luminosity - surface brightness relation at @xmath333  mag .",
    "we find that the surface brightness distribution of galaxies exhibits interesting behaviour , with a well bounded gaussian - like distribution at @xmath26 , qualitatively consistent with the combination of the kormendy relation for spheroids and a @xmath334 broader freeman s law for bright disks . at @xmath26",
    "we find that the surface brightness distribution is well described by a gaussian with parameters : @xmath335  mpc@xmath7 , @xmath336  mag  arcsec@xmath1 , @xmath337  mag  arcsec@xmath1  with a @xmath321 of @xmath338 . at fainter luminosities the normalisation increases ,",
    "the characteristic surface brightness becomes fainter and the dispersion broadens until the distribution appears almost flat ( or possibly bimodal ) .",
    "the schechter function fit to the gaussian normalisations ( column 4 of table 3 ) provides a basic completeness correction and yields consistent schechter function parameters to those quoted in section [ lfresult ] , i.e.  @xmath339  mpc@xmath7 , @xmath340  mag and @xmath341 with a @xmath321 of @xmath342 .    in comparison to the 2dfgrs study of @xcite",
    "we find a consistent luminosity - surface brightness relation but with a significantly broader dispersion in surface brightness .",
    "this is predominantly due to the implementation of seeing corrected size , direct ( i.e. , profile - independent ) half - light radius measurements and improved completeness for extended systems .",
    "a comparison to the sdss results of @xcite and @xcite are complex because of the sdss standard of circular aperture photometry .",
    "however we find that our results can be reconciled with those of @xcite but not with those of @xcite .",
    "we also note that the sdss use of circular apertures also leads to significantly narrower surface brightness distributions .      various studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ) relate the gaussian dispersion of the surface brightness distribution , or equivalently of the @xmath174 is the half - light radius measured in kpc .",
    "it is related to surface brightness by @xmath343 and hence @xmath344 . ]",
    "distribution , to the dimensionless spin parameter of the dark matter halo , @xmath345 @xcite .",
    "the basic concept is that the baryons in the disk reflect the angular momentum state ( rotational or dispersive ) of the dark matter halo .",
    "while the luminosity relates to the mass , the disk scale - length relates to the specific angular momentum via the spin parameter .",
    "numerical simulations generally predict values for @xmath21 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is most consistent with our observations at fainter luminosities .",
    "however , at brighter luminosities we find a significantly narrower dispersion @xmath346 .",
    "this may imply that brighter , more mature galaxies have evolved via mechanisms currently beyond the standard numerical simulations ( i.e. , the baryons have decoupled from the dark matter halo and evolved away from the halo properties ) .",
    "alternatively it may argue for significant non - directional baryon infall onto the halo , muddying any coupling between the primordial baryons and the halo @xcite .",
    "further possibilities might also include the presence of bulges in high luminosity systems whose properties depend more critically on a central supermassive black hole @xcite .    one intriguing result of the simulations is the lack of variation of the surface brightness or size distribution with mass ( @xcite .",
    "however , the more detailed studies which actually follow individual halos _ do _ imply a greater variation in @xmath347 for low - mass systems .",
    "for example , @xcite trace the history of three halos through the merging process .",
    "they clearly show that @xmath347 initially varies significantly as the halos grow but that it becomes more resilient to mergers once the halos reach sufficient mass .",
    "ultimately all three halos converge towards a common value at high mass .",
    "this seems plausible as one would expect smaller systems to be more affected by mergers than more massive systems .",
    "the surface brightness distribution of galaxies has been hotly debated for over thirty years since the advent of freeman s law and the conjecture that it is wholly a selection bias @xcite . while in many minds",
    "the debate is resolved through deep hi studies ( e.g.@xcite ) and ly-@xmath28 absorption line studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , others remain loyal to disney s conjecture ( e.g.  oneil , andreon & culliandre 2003 ) and still argue for a flat surface brightness distribution at all luminosities ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) implying a significant amount of hidden mass . at least in oneil",
    "et al.s case this stance derives from neglecting the clear luminosity - surface brightness relation seen in their data .",
    "the global surface brightness distribution may indeed be flat but the low surface brightness systems are predominantly dwarfs , providing little enhancement to the global luminosity , baryon or mass densities .",
    "we have attempted to address this debate through careful consideration of _ most _ selection issues .",
    "we probe to depths where the distribution is clearly bounded and where we robustly demonstrate we could reliably recover giant low surface brightness galaxies were they to exist in significant numbers .",
    "they do not .",
    "while we address the selection bias in the redshift survey as a function of apparent magnitude and apparent surface brightness other potential selection effects remain unexplored .",
    "for example , the redshift completeness may well be a function of spectral type , in which case the assumption that all galaxies of similar apparent magnitude and surface brightness are drawn from the same redshift distribution will not be correct . in particular , inert low surface brightness galaxies which may have insufficient features to readily yield a redshift and may be missed entirely .",
    "we also do not at this stage decompose galaxies into bulge and disk components .",
    "this is clearly required by both the observations ( which show two , or possibly three , distinct luminosity - surface brightness relations for spheroid and disk components ) as well as by theory and simulations which argue for distinct formation mechanisms for these components ( merger and accretion respectively ; e.g.  pierani , mohayaee & de freitas pacheco 2004 ) .",
    "we hence intend to extend our analysis in three ways : @xmath214 per cent spectroscopic completeness ; bulge - disk decompositions ; and extension to longer wavelengths and in particular the near - ir which promises smoother , dust - free profiles .",
