    "( note that the original statement in @xcite is mistaken and would actually imply the existence of two common fixed points . )",
    "in this section we derive theorem 1 from the following two lemmata , which will be proved in subsections 2.1 and 2.2 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a lefschetz fibration with monodromy @xmath96 and let @xmath58 be a cohomology class whose restriction to @xmath97 has a preimage @xmath98 in @xmath99 .",
    "let @xmath100 and @xmath101 the restriction of @xmath98 to @xmath102 .",

    "a few remarks are in order about well - definedness of the involved homomorphisms .",
    "the second line is the long exact homotopy sequences of the surface bundle @xmath114 .",
    "inclusion maps @xmath115 to @xmath116 , hence @xmath117 clearly , the projection maps @xmath102 to @xmath118 .",
    "surjectivity of this homomorphism does not follow from the commutative diagram , but is easy to see geometrically .",
    "indeed , each simple loop @xmath34 surrounding a puncture can be lifted to an element @xmath119 , just working in coordinate charts . for @xmath120",
    ", we fix some lift @xmath121 .",
    "then @xmath122 is an element of @xmath102 , projecting to @xmath123 .",
    "since @xmath124 is generated by elements of the form @xmath123 , we have surjectivity .    to prove theorem 1 , assume that @xmath54 is bounded .",
    "the restriction of @xmath54 to @xmath97 is the euler class of the surface bundle @xmath114 with fiber of genus @xmath125 . as @xmath12 has genus @xmath125",
    ", @xmath126 is hyperbolic .",
    "so we have that the restriction of @xmath54 to @xmath97 is bounded .",
    "then @xmath104 , according to lemma 1 . letting @xmath127 be the restriction of @xmath101 to @xmath128 , we conclude in particular @xmath129 .",
    "however , as explained in the preliminaries , if we are given a hyperbolic metric on @xmath25 , then , for any @xmath130 , @xmath39 can be represented by a mapping which lifts to a hyperbolic isometry of @xmath131 .",
    "( the axis of the hyperbolic isometry projects to a loop representing @xmath77 . )",
    "this implies that @xmath132 has exactly two fixed points .",
    "hence @xmath132 is of rotation number zero and we may apply lemma 2 to conclude that there must exist a common fixed point @xmath109 for all @xmath132 , @xmath95 .    since @xmath25 is a compact hyperbolic surface ,",
    "@xmath133 consists only of hyperbolic isometries .",
    "but if @xmath134 and @xmath135 were hyperbolic isometries which had exactly one fixed point in common , then @xmath136 would be parabolic , contradicting the cocompactness of @xmath67 in @xmath137 .",
    "therefore all @xmath138 , are boundary maps of hyperbolic isometries with the same pairs of fixed points .",
    "these hyperbolic isometries belong to a 1-parameter group .",
    "hence , by discreteness , the image of @xmath7 must be cyclic .                by theorem 1",
    ", we conclude that all singular fibers would have the same vanishing cycle . if there were two singular fibers , the unique vanishing cycle would bound two disks , pasting together to a nontrivial element of @xmath148 after connecting the vanishing cycles by some cylinder .",
    "( to see that the union of the two disks is nontrivial in @xmath149 , consider the local handlebody decomposition of @xmath11 : it contains two 2-handles attached to tubular neighborhoods of the vanishing cycles , i.e. , to copies of @xmath150 , where @xmath60 corresponds to the vanishing cycle . if there where a 3-ball bounding the union of these two disks , it could be made transverse to @xmath150 , hence intersecting it in a surface bounded by the vanishing cycle .",
    "but the vanishing cycle is not 0-homologous in @xmath150 . )",
    "this follows from corollary 1 because a riemannian manifold @xmath11 with negative sectional curvature has word - hyperbolic fundamental group and moreover , from the cartan - hadamard theorem , @xmath151 for @xmath152 .",
    "lefschetz fibrations over a base of genus @xmath155 , with regular fiber of genus @xmath26 and exactly one singular fiber , exist if and only if there is some dehn twist in @xmath156 which can be written as a product of @xmath155 commutators , which according to @xcite is possible if and only if @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "recall that , for a lefschetz fibration @xmath9 with critical points @xmath48 , @xmath24 and @xmath159 , we have a monodromy map @xmath160 with euler class @xmath161 .",

    "+ we consider the exact sequence @xmath170 , with @xmath171 .",
    "bouarich s exact sequence ( a ) implies that @xmath172 if and only if the restriction of @xmath98 to @xmath102 is trivial in the _ bounded _ cohomology of @xmath102 .    using the exact sequence @xmath173 , stated at the beginning of the proof of theorem 1 ,",
    "one actually can apply bouarich s exact sequence @xmath174 and conclude that @xmath175 if and only if @xmath176 and the preimage of @xmath177 in @xmath178 ( which then exists by bouarich s sequence ) is zero .",

    "we denote @xmath181 the induced homomorphism for a fixed base point @xmath31 , and @xmath182 the induced homeomorphism of the gromov - boundary @xmath183 , as in chapter 1 .",
    "let @xmath184 be the set of fixed points on the gromov - boundary .            for @xmath186 let @xmath187 be the homomorphism such that @xmath188 .",
