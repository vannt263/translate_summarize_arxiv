    "the ccs molecule was first discovered toward tmc-1 by suzuki et al .",

    "1997 , hereafter wlg ) .",
    "ccs is also an excellent probe of kinematic structure of dark clouds because of its lack of hyperfine splittings and its moderate optical depth .",
    "moreover , the ccs structure is hund s case b and as such has a large zeeman splitting factor of 0.70  hz@xmath11g@xmath8 at 33 ghz ( shinnaga & yamamoto , 1999 ) , which provides an opportunity to explore the magnetic field structure in the early stage of star formation .",
    "several single - dish surveys of ccs have been done in the past 10 years .",
    "the survey done by fuente et al .",
    "( 1990 ) showed that n(ccs ) increases with n(18o ) and n(hc@xmath12n ) .",
    "however , this correlation is not so obvious for later observations (  4.2 ) .",
    "syo performed the largest single - dish survey toward 49 dark cores and concluded that ccs is more abundant in cold quiescent dark clouds while less abundant in star - forming regions .",
    "they also constructed a pseudo - time - dependent chemical evolution model , suggesting that ccs is more abundant in the early stage of chemical evolution whereas 3 is more abundant in the later stage .",
    "[ ccs]/[3 ] was proposed as an indicator of cloud evolution and star formation .",
    "based on this suggestion , scappini & codella ( 1996 ) observed 3 and ccs toward a sequence of objects in different evolutionary stages  dark clouds , inactive bok globules , active bok globules , and massive protostars .",
    "however , because of the large scatter , their data did not determine a trend .",
    "the most recent survey done by benson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) only showed a slight tendency for ccs to have a higher column density in starless cores , but their result was not statistically significant .",
    "ccs maps of dark clouds have been made toward b335 and l1498 .",
    "velusamy et al .  (",
    "1995 ) combined vla and dsn 70 m single - dish maps of the 22 ghz ccs @xmath13 transition toward b335 and showed that the distribution of ccs emission is non - spherical and clumpy with depletion in the central 10 .",
    "they concluded that ccs is characteristic of early astrochemical time ( t@xmath14 yr ) and more prominent in the region just outside the infall envelope .",
    "wlg showed that the ccs emission of l1498 has two peaks separated by 2   in the se - nw direction .",
    "however , the nh@xmath6 map ( @xcite ) only shows a single component between two ccs components .",
    "kuiper et al .  (",
    "1996 ) interpreted this as the ccs originating in a shell outside of the ammonia core , and concluded that l1498 may be about to collapse rapidly to form a protostar .    in this paper",
    ", we present a survey with largest number of ccs maps and spectra .",
    "these data with large field of view ( @xmath5 6 ) and adequate velocity and spatial resolutions provide a better foundation to examine the existent arguments . in ",
    "2 we describe our observation and data reduction procedure . in ",
    "3 we present the analysis for obtaining physical parameters and discuss the results in  4 . we summarize the conclusions in  5 .",
    "we used 1-cm receivers ( carlstrom 1996 ) on the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima , welch et al 1996 ) array to observe the ccs @xmath15 line toward 11 dark clouds or star - forming regions .",
    "the sources we observed are listed in table 1 .",
    "the frequency of this ccs transition is 33.75138 ghz ( wlg ) .",
    "most of the observations were carried out between 1997 aug 27 and sep 3 with one additional track for extended b1 emission on 1998 sep 7 . during the observations in 1997 ,",
    "bima was in the d configuration with 9 antennas .",
    "the range of the baselines of d configuration was 0.68.0 kilowavelength , and the synthesized beam was about 30@xmath330 , slightly different for different sources .",
    "the primary beam was about 6  at 33.75 ghz .",
    "all correlators to the most distant antenna from the center of array were unstable during the observations in 1997 .",
    "the corrupt baselines were carefully flagged out .",
    "the extra track on b1 was obtained in order to observe extended emission around the edge of the primary beam in the previous observation . in this track , a northern field , b1(n ) , and a southwestern field , b1(sw ) ,",
    "were observed for 15 min each sequentially .",
    "the distances from the phase centers of each field to the center of the previous observation were less than half of the primary beam .",
    "bima was in a special compact configuration for this observation .",
    "baseline range was about the same as d configuration , but because the compact array had more shorter baselines , it produced a 43@xmath336  beam for b1 .    in order to resolve the extremely narrow linewidth of the quiescent dark clouds ,",
    "the correlators were set in the mode with the highest resolution available on bima , 0.054 /s . in this mode , we only had one spectral window in each sideband .",
    "the total bandwidth of each spectral window was 6.25 mhz ( 55.3 /s ) .",
    "the 1-cm receivers operated from 27 to 36 ghz with a single sideband response at the bottom and top of the tuning range and with double sideband response in the center . because the lower sideband was 23 times more sensitive than the upper sideband , we set the observed line in the lower sideband and the upper sideband was out of the operating range . as a result , we obtained a single sideband system .",
    "the system temperatures ranged from 40k to 96k during the observations in 1997 and from 130k to 230k for the observation in 1998 .",
    "the much higher system temperature in the second year was due to worse weather .",
    "we chose the brightest quasars within 10@xmath16 of the sources as the phase calibrators .",
    "the phase calibrators were observed for 5 minutes every 30 minutes on the sources .",
    "we also observed a planet for 5 minutes for each source in order to calibrate flux . because the observed bandwidth was very narrow and the signal to noise ratios were not high for the short observation time for each source , passband calibration was unnecessary .",
    "all data reduction was carried out using the miriad software ( sault , teuben , & wright 1995 ) .",
    "bad visibility data were flagged , and data were phase calibrated and flux calibrated before being transformed into images . for those sources with line detections , the continuum was subtracted in the @xmath17 plane , although the continuum was within the noise level .",
    "natural weighting was used for constructing the images , and the clean algorithm was used to deconvolve the dirty beam from the image .",
    "the boundary of the regions for deconvolution were chosen approximately between -1 @xmath18 and 1 @xmath18 rms levels around the sources in dirty maps , which provided better images especially for sources with high - sidelobe dirty beams .",
    "the rms noise level of all sources in table 1 were estimated from a region in the clean map which did not contain signal .",
    "primary beam correction was applied to the three fields of b1 which were then combined linearly .",
    "taper was applied on the combined map of b1 to avoid excessive noise amplification at the edge of the mosaiced field and to achieve approximately uniform noise across the image .",
    "out of the 11 objects , 7 are detected with strong ccs emission and extremely narrow linewidthes ( 0.10.8 /s ) . among the 4 objects without ccs detection ( dr21 , omc - n4 , s106 , w3 ) , all except omc - n4 are active star - forming regions , which suggests that ccs could be destroyed in the later stage of star formation .",
    "omc - n4 is a dense ( @xmath19 @xmath10 ) region at the position north of the omc1 core without active star formation where n bearing molecules are especially abundant .",
    "the 7 clouds with ccs detection show tremendous clumpy structure .",
    "we identified the clumps in these ccs clouds and analyzed them separately .",
    "a clump is identified in channel maps if there is an isolated peak with intensity greater than 3 @xmath18 in the image - velocity data cube across more than 3 channels .",
    "we treat b335 and l63 as one clump each .",
    "b335 has double peaks , but it was previously modeled as a collapsing cloud ( zhou et al .",

    "the @xmath20 and linewidth of each clump are fitted with a gaussian at the peak position and are listed in table 2 .",
    "68% of clumps have total linewidths @xmath21 0.25 /s .",

    "the multiple - line ccs survey of syo determined @xmath27 = 5k for b1 , b335 , l63 , and l1544 , and @xmath27 = 5.2k for l1498 .",
    "we adopt @xmath27 = 5k for all our samples except l1498 . because of the high intensity of l1498 , its excitation temperature must be greater than 5.5k unless the optical depth is negative .",

    "( 1998 ) . therefore",
    ", the optical depth @xmath28 in column 5 of table 2 was obtained from the radiative transfer equation    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the plank function .",

    "the virial masses in column 7 of table 3 were determined by assuming a self - gravitating sphere with @xmath37 and a gaussian velocity distribution for each clump .",

    "if the density law is between @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the virial mass would only change from 0.6 to 1.1 @xmath44 as given in equation ( 4 ) .",
    "the slope of the ( ccs)@xmath2 correlation derived in  4.2 is independent of the assumed density law .",
    "the radii of the clumps r listed in columns 4 and 5 of table 3 are estimated from half of the geometric average of the fwhm of major and minor axes of the clumps . assuming the nonthermal part of the ccs and h@xmath41 linewidth are the same , @xmath40 can be calculated from @xmath45 and the difference between their thermal widths .",

    "large uncertainties for @xmath44 , h@xmath41 density , and the fractional abundance come from the unknown dimension along the line of sight .",
    "if the estimated dimension is larger by a factor of 2 , then the @xmath44 would be larger by the same factor , the h@xmath41 density would be smaller by a factor of 4 , and the fractional abundance of ccs would be larger by a factor of 2 .",

    "a systematic velocity field with a range from 6.0 /s to 7.1 /s is found along an arc formed by clumps a , b and f. this appears to be a rotational motion about iras 03301 + 3057 .",

    "they modeled the velocity structure with a simple two - layer collapsing model and concluded that the data are inconsistent with the inside - out collapse model .",

    "six clumps are identified in l1544 , which is elongated along the northwest to southeast direction .",

    "because the self - absorption toward the center has been observed with cs , the central hole of the ring should not indicate a physical hole in the center .",
    "instead it may be a further evidence that ccs only traces the outer envelope of dense cores .",
    "it has been widely suggested that ccs is more abundant in the early stage of protostellar cores .",
    "however , observationally it is difficult to determine a clear inverse correlation of ( ccs ) with h@xmath41 density as an indicator of the cloud age . except for the work done by fuente et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , observational data show that the correlation is fairly weak ( syo , wlg , benson et al .",
    "fuente et al .",
    "( 1990 ) show a positive correlation between ( ccs ) and ( 18o ) for seven dark clouds , which seems inconsistent with the prediction of chemical models unless the seven clouds are all in a very early stage .",
    "since ccs distributions are clumpy and may be shell - like around the higher density core whereas co apparently exists in a larger area , the depth of the ccs column should be a few factors smaller than that of the co column .",
    "therefore , the average densities obtained from co may not be able to represent the density of ccs clumps .",
    "in addition , based on the complex distributions and active chemical reactions ( formation in the outer lower density region and destruction in the central higher density region ) , it seems unsuitable to use a single average density to represent the chemical behavior of ccs in the whole cloud .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to analysis the ( ccs)@xmath64(h@xmath41 ) correlation at the clump level .    in order to have a systematic analysis at the clump level",
    ", we adopt the virial density to represent the h@xmath41 densities .",
    "if the clouds are not virialized , the h@xmath41 densities will be incorrect , but the statistical conclusion would still be valid if the virial densities were scaled from the actual densities with similar factors .",
    "we obtain a very weak correlation , @xmath65(ccs ) @xmath66 @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "this relation brackets the weak correlation , @xmath65(ccs ) @xmath68 @xmath67 obtained by wlg for one of the three velocity components of tmc-1d . in their study , the correlations for the other two components of tmc-1d are too weak to be distinguished from a flat distribution .",
    "therefore , we conclude that even though ccs is more abundant in the early stage of a contracting cloud , the abundance of ccs is not likely to trace the age of the contracting cores very sensitively .",
    "moreover , an almost flat distribution could imply that the time for creating and destroying ccs may be very short compared to the lifetime of ccs .",
    "we compare the average h@xmath41 column density obtained from c@xmath7o or nh@xmath6 observations ( myers et al .",
    "1983 , benson & myers 1989 ) to the average virial h@xmath41 column density of each cloud for our ccs data .",
    "the average virial column density of each cloud is calculated by averaging that of all clumps in the cloud .",
    "the comparison results are listed in table 4 . except for cloud b1 ,",
    "the observed column density is much smaller than the ccs virial column density , which suggests that the ccs clumps are not virialized . since the real densities of the ccs clumps should be smaller than the virial densities , x(ccs ) estimated in table 3",
    "can only provide lower limits .",
    "the channel maps of our sampled clouds ( fig .",
    "17(a ) ) show the remarkable clumpy structure of the ccs distribution . as suggested by velusamy et al .",
    "( 1995 ) from the observation of b335 , the clumpy structure may originate from the destruction of ccs in the densest region of the pre - protostellar cores . therefore , combined with our conclusion in  4.3 , we suggest that the clumps traced by ccs may not be self - contracting cores for protostars , but only higher density condensations in the envelope of a collapsing core .",
    "the above idea can be further supported by comparing the relative positions of ccs and higher density regions , traced by 3 emission or submillimeter continuum sources .",

    "we found that except for cloud b1 , ccs generally exists around the higher density regions .",
    "this can be seen obviously for b133 , l63 , and l183 , where the ccs emission exists asymmetrically around the submillimeter continuum sources . for l1498",
    ", the 3 peak appears between two ccs clumps , and for l1544 , the 3 peak might be in the center of the ring structure discussed in  4.1.7 .",
    "the 3 peak in b335 is close to the integrated intensity peak , and close to the place with central depletion reported by velusamy et al .",
    "although for the b1 main core ( clump a ",
    "f ) the ccs distribution is similar to the 3 distribution observed by bachiller et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , the ccs distribution appears to be more clumpy than the 3 distribution . also , the 3 peak is at the gap between clump b and e. therefore , the ccs distributions for all clouds are consistent with the idea that ccs traces the envelope of pre - protostellar cores rather than being individual self - gravitation cores themselves .",
    "almost 2 decades after larson ( 1981 ) discovered a clear correlation between the linewidths and the cloud sizes @xmath69 , the physical origin of this larson s law remains an important unsolved problem .",
    "it has been widely discussed that turbulence or magnetohydrodynamic turbulence may provide the large nonthermal component of linewidths and the scaling relation through energy dissipation , though a complete theory has not yet been established .",
    "a question has been asked : does the relation terminate at small scale ?",
    "goodman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) proposed a scenario that a transition to coherent linewidths takes place at the length scale @xmath5 0.1 pc based on their observations of 3 lines with spatial resolution 60 - 80 .",
    "the nonthermal components of linewidths in coherent cores are less than the thermal widths of h@xmath41 , but strictly non - zero .",
    "they suggest that the coherent length scale may come from the dissipation threshold of mhd waves",
    ".    the ccs clouds in our sample with physical sizes comparable to the coherent length scale can be a test ground of the existence of the coherent cores .",
    "the velocity dispersion of each pixel can be easily calculated from the second - order moment analysis .",
    "a cut - off level of 2 @xmath18 on the spectrum must be set when calculating the velocity dispersion in order to reduce the confusion from noise .",
    "however , this high cut - off level can significantly reduce the velocity dispersion if the signal - to - noise ratio is low . assuming an ideal gaussian profile",
    ", we calculated how the correction coefficient varies with the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "averaging the corrected linewidth maps , we found that the linewidth - radius relation for each cloud is very consistent with a flat distribution .",
    "the result is not sensitive to the center position we chose .",
    "an example of l1498 is shown in fig .  10 .",
    "since the linewidths are almost homogeneous everywhere for each cloud , the widths from the gaussian fitting listed in table 2 can represent the typical linewidth in the cloud .",
    "the total linewidth of ccs is almost contributed by the nonthermal width , since ccs is a heavy molecule .",
    "the thermal linewidth of h@xmath41 at t@xmath7010k is about 0.5 /s .",
    "therefore , the nonthermal linewidths of our sampled clouds are comparable or less than the thermal linewidth of h@xmath41 .    the observed facts seem to support the picture of coherent cores",
    ". however , as we discussed in  4.4 , we have to be cautious that ccs may only trace the envelope rather than the center of cores .",
    "therefore , the linewidth at small radius on the sky does not necessarily represent the linewidth at small distance from the center of the core .",
    "nevertheless , we can say at least the linewidths are very homogeneous in the narrow density regions traced by ccs .",
    "ccs is an abundant molecule in quiescent dark clouds and is not detectable in active star - forming regions .",
    "seven out of 25 clumps have extremely small nonthermal linewidths , @xmath1 0.1 /s .",
    "the distributions of ccs are very clumpy , and the ccs clumps are not necessarily symmetric around the higher density regions where protostars may be born .",
    "the ccs clumps themselves are not likely to collapse into protostars , but rather exist transiently in the regions with appropriate densities as the cloud evolves .",
    "therefore , we conclude that ccs traces pre - protostellar cores in the very early stage of star formation or traces the envelope of pre - protostellar cores in the later stage .",
    "homogeneous linewidths in ccs clouds may provide evidence that the nonthermal linewidths transition to coherence at the length scale @xmath5 0.1 pc , which is proposed by goodman et al .",
    "because ccs is a zeeman molecule and also an excellent kinematic probe , follow - up polarimetry and high velocity resolution studies could provide a good opportunity to understand the physical properties of star - forming regions in the early stage .",
    "l1544 , with a very systematic velocity field and strong ccs emission , is an excellent target to model the physical condition of a collapsing core .",
