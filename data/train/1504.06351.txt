    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the fundamental theory describing the strong interaction .",
    "it is well known that qcd has the rich phase structure at finite temperature and density @xcite . and",
    "yet , regions that we can access with the perturbation are limited .",
    "currently , the most promising method to explore the phase diagram is lattice qcd simulation which is first principle calculation of qcd .",
    "although the lattice qcd simulations are very successful to analyze the phase diagram of a finite temperature system , at finite density they have a severe problem , so - called sign problem , and outcomes of the first - principle calculation can be available only at small chemical potential range . in finite temperature and density systems , lots of physically interesting targets such as the early universe , neutron stars , quark matters are waited to be explored .",
    "therefore , it is quite desirable to explore methods for investigating finite density qcd systems from ab initio calculation ; this is the one of the urgent subjects in particle physics and nuclear physics .",
    "the canonical approach we study in this paper is a promising candidate for this purpose . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the fugacity expansion by a method of the hopping parameter expansion was constructed as a winding number expansion , and the chiral condensate as well as the thermodynamic quantities is studied .",
    "more detailed analyses were performed in ref.@xcite in a wide range of the temperature and chemical potential regions , and an indication of the transition was first observed below @xmath3 and finite baryon density . in this paper , we address two questions :    1 .   does the lattice canonical approach produce consistent results with the mpr ? 2 .   in obtaining the canonical partition functions for large baryon number ,",
    "what is a role of the multi precision calculations ?      in @xmath4 flavor qcd case with the degenerate quark masses , the grand canonical partition function at finite temperature @xmath2 and finite quark chemical potential @xmath5 is given in the path integral formalism as follows .",
    "@xmath6\\{\\det\\delta(\\mu_q)\\}^{n_f}e^{-s_\\mathrm{g}},\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the one flavor fermion determinant and @xmath8 is the gauge action .",
    "because the fermion determinant has the property @xmath9^\\ast=\\det\\delta(-\\mu_q^\\ast),\\ ] ] the monte carlo measure @xmath10 becomes complex number at finite real chemical potential and the standard monte carlo method breaks down .",
    "consequently , we can not study finite density thermodynamics with standard grand canonical method .",
    "this difficulty is called sign problem .    a system described by the grand canonical partition function @xmath11 is equivalent to a system described by the canonical partition function @xmath12 with fugacity @xmath13 in thermodynamic limit .",
    "the relation of two ensembles can be written as a fugacity expansion@xcite using eigen vectors of number operator @xmath14 ,    @xmath15    where @xmath13 is fugacity .",
    "if we have the canonical partition functions , @xmath16 , for all net quark numbers @xmath17 , we can construct the grand canonical partition function as a polynomial of fugacity with coefficients @xmath18 . from this formula ,",
    "one can obtain lee - yang zeros@xcite , which reflect the system s critical nature@xcite .",
    "the canonical partition functions are constructed through the fourier transformation of grand canonical partition function at pure imaginary chemical potential@xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "eq.([det ] ) tells us that the fermion determinant is real in the case of pure imaginary chemical potential .",
    "monte carlo simulations can then be performed and the canonical partition functions are obtained by eq.([fourier ] ) .",
    "eq.([fourier ] ) also insists that the canonical partition fuctions are real number because the grand canonical partition function is even function ( charge conjugation invariant ) in terms of chemical potential .",
    "considering this feature with eq.([canonical ] ) , one can find that canonical partition functions are real and positive also in the context of canonical approach .",
    "once @xmath18 are available , we can construct the grand partition function by eq.([canonical ] ) at any _ real _ quark chemical potential .",
    "this is because the chemical potential dependence of the grand canonical partition function appears only through fugacity , @xmath13 , which is the variable of the polynomial , and not in the coefficients , @xmath18 in eq.([canonical ] ) ; the effect of the chemical potential appears through the fugacity and the canonical partition function plays just a role of coefficients in the fugacity expansion of the grand canonical partition function .",
    "in this work , we employ the rg - improved gauge action @xmath21\\ ] ] with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and the clover improved wilson fermion action with the quark matrix @xmath24 \\notag \\\\ & -\\kappa\\big[e^{+\\mu_qa}(1-\\gamma_4)u_4(n)\\delta_{m , n+\\hat{4 } } \\notag \\\\ & \\hspace{17.5mm}+e^{-\\mu_qa}(1+\\gamma_4)u_4^\\dagger(m)\\delta_{m , n-\\hat{4}}\\big ]   \\notag \\\\ & \\equiv1-\\kappa q(\\mu_q).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath25 are space - time coordinates on a lattice , @xmath26 is hopping parameter and @xmath5 is the quark chemical potential which is introduced to the temporal part of link variables .    in order to obtain canonical partition functions ,",
    "we need to compute the grand canonical partition functions at various pure imaginary chemical potential values in fourier transformation eq.([fourier ] ) .",
    "we use the reweighting method to evaluate the grand canonical partition function , @xmath27^{n_f } \\left\\{\\det\\delta(\\mu_0)\\right\\}^{n_f}\\hspace{1mm}e^{-s_{g } } \\notag \\\\ & = \\left<\\left[\\frac{\\det\\delta(i\\mu_i)}{\\det\\delta(\\mu_0)}\\right]^{n_f}\\right>_{\\mu_0}z_{gc}(\\mu_0),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 or pure imaginary values .",
    "we can then evaluate the canonical partition function as @xmath29 we adopt , here , normalized canonical partition functions eq.([const ] ) in order to avoid the extra constant @xmath30 in eq.([zapi ] ) ; this step does not affect the physical result .",
    "now the evaluation of the grand canonical partition function is reduced to the calculation of ratios of fermion determinants in eq.([zapi ] ) .    performing the hopping parameter expansion in the logarithm",
    ", we write the fermion determinant as @xmath31 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "= \\exp\\bigg[-\\mathrm{tr}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\kappa^i}{j}q^j(i\\mu_i)\\bigg].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the trace is taken over space - time , spinor and color . here , we used the following identity for arbitrary matrix a : @xmath32 and @xmath33 is expanded assuming @xmath26 is small ( hopping parameter expansion ) .",
    "the contribution of the trace in eq.([hpe ] ) comes from all closed loops on a lattice , and the chemical potential dependence comes from specific closed loops winding along positive and negative time directions .",
    "we can thus classify the trace of the hopping parameter expansion in eq.([hpe ] ) according to the winding number which is the number of net windings along the time direction . as a result",
    ", we can reach following expression with coefficients @xmath34 and complex fugacity @xmath35 .",
    "here @xmath17 represents the winding number .",
    "@xmath36.\\ ] ] we call this expression as ` winding number expansion ' .",
    "the negative winding number appeared in eq.([wne ] ) stands for the winding along negative time direction .",
    "the coefficients @xmath34 has no chemical potential dependence ; the chemical potential dependence appears in the fugacity .",
    "consequently , we have only to calculate @xmath34 from given gauge configurations to obtain grand canonical partition functions at desired pure imaginary chemical potential .",
    "roberge and weiss pointed out that the qcd grand canonical partition at pure imaginary chemical potential has the following periodicity@xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 . using eq.([rws ] ) , we rewrite the grand canonical partition function as @xmath39 then , we get the following relation , @xmath40 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we obtain the following important constraint on the canonical partition functions , @xmath41 note that this holds both in the confinement and the deconfinement phases .",
    "now the grand partition function can be written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "because this quantum number @xmath44 can be interpreted as net baryon number , @xmath0 can be regarded as baryon chemical potential which is related to quark chemical potential as @xmath45 .      in a homogeneous system , the dimensionless equation of state at @xmath46",
    "is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 with a lattice spacing @xmath50 .",
    "the deviation of the pressure from @xmath51 is given by @xmath52    the dimensionless baryon number density @xmath53 and susceptibility @xmath54 are @xmath55 @xmath56",
    "we adopt @xmath57-flavor clover improved wilson fermion action with @xmath58 evaluated by one - loop perturbation theory and rg - improved gauge action .",
    "all simulations were performed on @xmath59 lattice .",
    "we considered @xmath60 = 2.00 , 1.95 , 1.90 , 1.85 , 1.80 , 1.70 which correspond to @xmath61 = 1.35(7 ) , 1.20(6 ) , 1.08(5 ) , 0.99(5 ) , 0.93(5 ) , 0.84(4)@xcite .",
    "the values of hopping parameter @xmath26 was determined for each @xmath60 by following the line of the consistent physics in case of @xmath62 in ref.@xcite .",
    "we generated gauge configurations at @xmath63 with the hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) method .",
    "the step size @xmath64 and number of steps @xmath65 of hmc were set to @xmath66 , @xmath67 so that the simulation time was @xmath68 .",
    "after the first @xmath69 trajectories for thermalization , we adopted @xmath70 configurations every 200 trajectories for each parameter set .      before proceeding to our numerical results",
    ", we refer to the instability of fourier transformation in canonical approach and then discuss our strategy to avoid it in this subsection .",
    "since the fugacity expansion of grand canonical partition function , eq.([canonical ] ) , converges at real baryon chemical potential , the canonical partition function @xmath71 must become smaller when the net baryon number @xmath72 becomes large .",
    "this means that we have to deal with quite small values as the results of fourier transformation .",
    "this step is quite difficult in the point of view of numerical calculation because the fourier transformation is an oscillatory integral .      in numerical calculation ,",
    "fourier transformation eq.([fourier ] ) is computed by discrete fourier transformation ( dft ) as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the interval number of dft . because dft is just a discretized version of fourier transformation in continuum theory , the instability of dft in canonical approach is simply caused by the numerical errors .",
    "they are classified into rounding error , truncation error , cancellation of significant digits and loss of trailing digits .",
    "the instability of dft does not come from truncation error since dft is not infinite series .",
    "accordingly , it is quite natural to consider that the instability originates from cancellation of significant digits or loss of trailing digits or both of them . in this work , we actually monitored the behavior of all variables in our dft program in order to study the effect of these two errors . as the result",
    ", we found that cancellation of significant digits is not negligible in dft program .",
    "fig.[drop ] represents cancelled digits in dft .",
    "for example , 80 digits are cancelled in case of @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "we also found that the appearance of the cancellation does not depend on temperature of a system .",
    "( color online ) cancelled significant digits in calculations of dft at over @xmath3 ( upper red points ) and below @xmath3 ( lower green points ) . ]",
    "cancellation of significant digits arises from the following types of calculation , @xmath77 in this case , six significant digits are lost .    in order to reduce the effect of this cancellation , we should increase significant digits as a solution .",
    "let us consider the next calculation with 22 significant digits .",
    "@xmath78 although six significant digits are definitely lost in this calculation , 16 significant digits survive in the final result .    summarizing above",
    ", the precision of the result can be kept by increasing significant digits of variables in this way .",
    "fig.[zndrop ] represents the cancelled digits in the calculation of @xmath79 with 16 , 32 , 48 , 64 precision calculation .",
    "according to this figure , for evaluating @xmath79 to larger @xmath17 , it is essential to increase significant digits of variables .",
    "first , we computed coefficients of winding number expansion @xmath34 up to @xmath80 with @xmath70 configurations in all temperature cases .",
    "we used @xmath81 ( above @xmath3 ) and @xmath82 ( below @xmath3 ) noise vectors to calculate the trace in the fermion determinant eq.([hpe ] ) .",
    "then , we evaluated the grand canonical partition functions at various pure imaginary chemical potentials using the winding number expansion with @xmath34 .",
    "after that , we evaluated the canonical partition function through fourier transformation and thermodynamic observables .",
    "we adopted multiple length precision calculation@xcite with @xmath70 significant digits in order to keep the sufficient precision except for the calculation of gauge configurations and @xmath34 .",
    "gauge configurations and @xmath34 were computed with double precision , i.e. , around 16 significant digits .",
    "note that canonical partition functions are complex number in numerical calculations because of numerical errors .",
    "therefore , we adopt the only real part of the canonical partiton function .",
    "if the real part of the canonical partition function is negative at some baryon number @xmath83 fo the first time , we adopt the result up to @xmath84 as canonical partiton functions .      in numerical calculation",
    ", we have to deal with the fugacity expansion of the grand canonical partition function as the finite series @xmath85 therefore , we have to judge the baryon chemical potential region where results are free from the truncation error",
    ". there may be several possible ways to analyze the effect of the truncation error ; in this work , we use the following analysis .",
    "first , we evaluate the expectation values of thermodynamic observables @xmath86 with eq.([trun ] ) .",
    "next , we calculate the expectation values @xmath87 by subtracting one from @xmath88 in eq.([trun ] ) .",
    "after that , we evaluate the relative error @xmath89 from these two expectation values ; and in this work we judge that the expectation value is reliable if the relative error is less than @xmath90 , @xmath91 in this way , we can ensure that expectation values of thermodynamic observables in the baryon chemical potential region determined by above analysis have two significant digits at least against the truncation error .      using the error estimation described in the previous subsection",
    ", we analyze the chemical potential dependence of thermodynamic observables and study the validity of canonical approach .",
    "first , we examine the pressure .",
    "fig.[pre - tdep ] shows that the results of pressure above @xmath3 do not suffer from large error up to around @xmath92 , and the results below @xmath3 are under control up to @xmath93 . on the other hand ,",
    "the result just below @xmath94 case is reliable only up to around @xmath95",
    ". this may be because we make configurations at @xmath63 and the configurations are suffered from the fluctuation caused by the phase transition at zero density .",
    "we may get clearer signals if we generate configurations at pure imaginary chemical potential because @xmath3 at pure imaginary chemical potential is higher than @xmath3 at zero chemical potential .",
    "( color online ) chemical potential dependence of pressure .",
    "red , green , blue , cyan , magenta and brown points are the results at @xmath96 .",
    "upper bound of baryon chemical potential is determined by eq.([oberror ] ) . ]",
    "( color online ) comparison of pressure calculated by canonical approach and multi parameter reweighting method",
    ". basically , color of data are same as fig.[pre - tdep ] .",
    "extra color : dark  red , dark  green , dark  blue , dark  cyan , dark  magenta and dark  brown points are the results at @xmath96 calculated by multi ",
    "parameter reweighting method .",
    "]    in fig.[pre - hikaku ] , we see that pressure calculated by canonical approach are consistent with results by mpr .",

    "color of data are same as fig.[pre - tdep ] .",

    "( color online ) comparison of the baryon number density calculated by canonical approach and multi parameter reweighting method .",
    "color of data are same as fig.[pre - hikaku ] . ]",
    "next , we consider the expectation value of the baryon number density . in fig.[nd - tdep ] , we find that the results are reliable up to around @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) above @xmath3 ( below @xmath3 ) . while , the reliable baryon chemical potential range of the result just below @xmath3 is limited up to @xmath99 .",
    "this may be caused by the same reason in the analysis of the pressure .",
    "fig.[nd - hikaku ] tells us that the canonical approach is consistent with mpr method also in the baryon number density case .",
    "moreover , we observe that the gradient of the baryon number density , @xmath83 , as a function of baryon chemical potential becomes smaller as the temperature decreases . in zero temperature case , @xmath83 is expected to be zero up to @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the lightest baryon mass of the system and it becomes a finite value at this point .",
    "indeed , the data at @xmath102 shows such a feature .",
    "( color online ) chemical potential dependence of susceptibility .",
    "color of data are same as fig.[pre - tdep ] .",
    "upper bound of baryon chemical potential is determined by eq.([oberror ] ) . ]        finally , we investigate the susceptibility .",
    "fig.[sus - tdep ] shows that the results above @xmath3 is reliable up to around @xmath103 , while the results below @xmath94 is reliable up to @xmath104 . from fig.[sus - hikaku ] , we find that canonical approach is very consistent with mpr method also in the susceptibility .",
    "the susceptibility as a function of the @xmath105 does not show a clear peak ; we do not see yet the signal of the phase transition between confined phase and deconfined phase .",
    "in this paper , we find that the canonical approach is consistent with mpr method .",
    "moreover , the canonical approach provides reliable results beyond @xmath95 in almost all observables .",
    "this is very encouraging for the first principle calculation of finite density qcd , because other methods such as mpr method , taylor expansion method and imaginary chemical potential method give reliable information practically only up to @xmath95 .",
    "the multiple precision calculation greatly contributes this conclusion .",
    "the canonical approach has been investigated several times @xcite ; we brush up the method here and find that it is a useful and promising method .",
    "but , we have to improve our method further to obtain results in more realistic condition , i.e. , lighter quark mass , large volume , finer lattice spacing and larger density .",
    "although the hopping parameter expansion gave very interesting results as we saw in this paper , the next step is to calculate the fermion determinant without this approximation ; we have learned in this paper that the key point is to calculate the determinant at imaginary chemical potential values that are fourier transformed with high accuracy in eq.([fourier ] ) .",
    "this requires more computational resource than the work reported here , but within scope of the next generation high performance era .",
