    "it is well known that the tsallis distribution gives excellent fits to the transverse momentum distributions observed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite and at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite with only three parameters , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( or , alternatively , a volume @xmath7  @xcite ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is referred as tsallis parameter and discussed elsewhere  @xcite in detail .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 obeys the standard thermodynamic relation , @xmath8 however , the entropy used in the above equation is the tsallis entropy  @xcite not the standard boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) entropy .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is not necessarily related to a volume deduced from other models like hbt calculations .",
    "it was recently shown that these fits extend to values  @xcite of @xmath0 up to 200 gev / c  @xcite .",
    "this is unexpected because in this kinematic range hard scattering processes become important  @xcite .",
    "a description of the high @xmath0 results has been discussed in @xcite where a model using a combination of tsallis at low @xmath0 and qcd hard scattering at high @xmath0 was considered .",
    "the present analysis shows that the tsallis distribution describes measurements up to the highest @xmath0 using the same tsallis parameters as those obtained at low @xmath0 .",
    "a power law based on the tsallis distribution  @xcite is used to fit the @xmath0 spectra of charged particles measured by the atlas and cms collaborations .",
    "the atlas collaboration has reported the transverse momentum in an inclusive phase space region taking into account at least two charged particles in the kinematic range @xmath9 < 2.5 and @xmath0 > 100 mev  @xcite . the cms collaboration has presented the differential transverse momentum distribution covering a @xmath0 range up to 200 gev / c , the largest range ever measured in a colliding beam experiment  @xcite .",
    "the results for the charged particle multiplicities are consistent with those of atlas measurements .",
    "moreover , the results are compared to those obtained in  @xcite where very good fits to transverse momentum distributions were presented .",
    "we confirm the quality of the fits but obtain different values of the parameters albeit using a different version of the tsallis model .",
    "power law distributions have been widely applied in high energy physics  @xcite to describe the transverse momentum spectra of secondary particles produced in proton - proton collisions . with the advent of the lhc , transverse momenta of hundreds of gev have been measured .",
    "it is of great interest to choose a distribution which describes such high @xmath0 measurements very well .",
    "a well suited form of the tsallis distribution is discussed in this paper and our main criterium for choosing such a distribution was thermodynamic consistency which has not always been implemented fully  @xcite .",
    "it is well established that there are numerous physical systems under which bg statistics encounters many difficulties . in particular , when analysing the @xmath0 spectra of hadrons it is found that spectra decrease far slower than predicted by bg statistics , and appear to follow some power law at high @xmath0 .",
    "the tsallis distribution was first proposed about twenty - seven years  @xcite ago as a generalization of the bg distribution .",
    "the tsallis form of the bg distribution is given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the energy and @xmath12 is the chemical potential and the function @xmath13 is usually defined as : @xmath14^{1/(q-1 ) }        & \\quad \\text{if }   x > 0\\\\      [ 1+(1-q)x]^{1/(1-q ) }        & \\quad \\text{if }   x \\le 0\\\\    \\end{cases}\\ ] ] in the limit where @xmath15 1 it reduces to the standard exponential : @xmath16    the expressions of the relevant thermodynamic quantities like entropy , @xmath17 , energy density , @xmath18 (= e / v ) , pressure , @xmath19 , and particle number , @xmath20 , are given below using the @xmath4-logarithm function , @xmath21 as integrals over the function defined in eq .",

    "it can be observed that the parameter @xmath50 @xmath51 4.5 fm and 5.0 fm for @xmath1 = 0.9 and 7 tev respectively for both atlas and cms data sets .",

    "an estimate of the charged particle multiplicity is presented for cms which can be verified by the cms collaboration .",
    "we find it quite remarkable that the transverse momentum distributions measured up to 200 gev / c in @xmath0 can be described consistently over 14 orders of magnitude by a straightforward tsallis distribution as presented in eq .",
