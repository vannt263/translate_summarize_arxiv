    "<S> strict classic 3-d dynamics theory reveals that arbitrarily high center frequency light source can be achieved by flexible application of not - too - strong static electric field and static magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitudes of the fields are not required to be high .    even though significant application value has promoted intensive investigation on short - wavelength  light source ( or x - ray or higher energy photons source ) for decades [ 1 - 14 ] , there are still considerable difficulty in making a satisfactory achievement on this issue . </S>",
    "<S> because @xmath0 @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) wavelength radiation means the time cycle being @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , we therefore wish the time cycle of electron motion to be @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) . clearly , the difficulty is just that so rapid electron oscillation , which can be finished hundreds ( or more ) times per @xmath5 , is unavailable . </S>",
    "<S> this limits the efficiency of generating x - ray . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the high - order harmonics generation ( hhg ) , if the driving laser is of @xmath0 @xmath1 wavelength , the driven atomic dipole moment oscillation is usually of a time cycle @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the hhg is only because the time shape of the driven atomic dipole moment oscillation differs from @xmath7greatly . </S>",
    "<S> this determines that low - order harmonics are dominant . according to most hhg experimental results [ 7 - 14 ] , low - order harmonics components whose orders are tens can be warranted but components at higher order hundreds are negligible . on the other hand , in free - electron - laser ( fel ) </S>",
    "<S> [ 2 - 5 ] , the efficiency of generating radiations at desired short wavelength is also far from satisfactory because sufficiently rapid electron velocity oscillation is unavailable .    </S>",
    "<S> clearly , if we can directly set up a sufficiently rapid electron velocity oscillation , we will obtain an efficient monocolor short - wavelength  light source at desired short wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath8 wavelength is desired , we should set up an electron velocity oscillation whose time cycle is @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> to drive so rapid oscillation usually demands , according to current knowledge , electromagnetic field of very short wavelength , which is unavailable because they are jsut what we are pursuing . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we are trying to get what we are pursuing by applying what we are pursuing .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a simple configuration containing merely static electric field ( along @xmath10-direction ) and static magnetic field ( along @xmath11-direction ) . </S>",

    "<S> .    there will be an elliptical trajectory for @xmath45 and a hyperbolic one for @xmath46 [ 15,16 ] . </S>",

    "<S> the equation can be written as a more general form    @xmath52    where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . </S>",

    "<S> it is easy to verify that for @xmath58 , there is @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> initially , @xmath60 and hence @xmath61 . from strict solution </S>",
    "<S> @xmath62 we can find the time for an electron travelling through an elliptical trajectory to meet @xmath63 $ ] and hence a time cycle @xmath64 namely , the oscillation along the elliptical trajectory will have a circular frequency @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is interest to note that @xmath66 will lead to @xmath67 } { 1-\\eta ^2}=0 $ ] and hence a straight - line trajectory @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> the motion on an ellipical trajectory is very inhomogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> the time for finishing the @xmath69 half might be very short while that for the @xmath70 half might be very long . </S>",
    "<S> we term two halves as fast - half and slow - half respectively . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath71 is fixed over whole space , a fast - half is always linked with a slow - half and hence makes the time cycle for finishing the whole trajectory being at considerable level .    for convenience , </S>",
    "<S> our discussion is based on the parameterized ellipse . </S>",
    "<S> for the case @xmath72 , ( where @xmath73 is small - valued positive ) , the starting position @xmath74 is the left extreme of the ellipse and hence corresponds to @xmath75 . the time required for an acute - angled rotation from @xmath75 to @xmath76 , ( where @xmath77 is small - valued positive ) , will be @xmath78 + \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\xi -\\xi ^2}$ ] , which is @xmath79 if @xmath80 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interest to note that if there is @xmath81 at the region @xmath82 , the electron will enter from @xmath83-region into @xmath84-region with an initial velocity whose @xmath10-component is @xmath85 and @xmath86-component @xmath87 is @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the electron will enter into the @xmath89-region a distance because of @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> after a time @xmath91 , the electron will return into the @xmath83-region and the returning velocity will have a @xmath10-component @xmath92 . during this stage , the electron will move @xmath93 along the @xmath86-direction . then </S>",
    "<S> , the motion in the @xmath94-region can be described by an acute - angled rotation along the ellipse @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a complete closed cycle along the @xmath10-direction is finished even though the motion along the @xmath86-direction is not closed . </S>",
    "<S> repeating this closed cycle will lead to an oscillation along the @xmath10-direction .    clearly , the time cycle of such an oscillation is @xmath96 + 2\\sigma \\sqrt{% 2\\xi -\\xi ^2}$ ] . under fixed values of @xmath73 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , the smaller </S>",
    "<S> @xmath77 is , the smaller @xmath99 is . </S>",
    "<S> there will be @xmath100 at @xmath80 . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , arbitrary value of @xmath101 can be achieved by choosing suitable value of @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> namely , arbitrary high center frequency ( @xmath103 ) oscillation can be achieved by choosing suitable value of @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> although the time history of @xmath104 might cause its fourier spectrum being of some spread , the center frequency will be @xmath105 .    </S>",
    "<S> this result implies a simple and universal method of setting up quasi - monocolor light source at any desirable center wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> that is , applying vertically static electric field @xmath106 and static magnetic field @xmath107 and on purpose letting a @xmath81 region existing and the ratio @xmath108 , then injecting electron along the @xmath86-axis with a velocity slightly above @xmath109 , and close to the boundary line between the @xmath110 region and the @xmath111 region . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig.1 , adjusting the distance @xmath112 can lead to a quasi - monocolor oscillation source with any desired center frequency up to @xmath113-ray level .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , we have described a simple and universal method of achieving quasi - monocolor light source at any desirable center wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> the kernel of this method is to utilize the motion of fast electron near the surface of magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> here , fast electron means its velocity being @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> actually , it is to adopt the fast - half of an ellipse and replace the time - consuming slow - half with a faster orbit governed by @xmath97 only . </S>"
