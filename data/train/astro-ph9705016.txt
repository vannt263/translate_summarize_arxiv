    "post - inflationary reheating in which the energy of a scalar field of the inflationary era is converted into the relativistic particles of the radiation era is of intrinsic interest , and there may prove to be tests of the mechanisms of inflation and reheating .",
    "a common scenario is that there is a period of inflation followed by reheating , consequently followed by the radiation era ; density and graviton perturbations are supposed to be of quantum origin arising in the inflaton field(s ) early in the inflationary era .",
    "it is an interesting question how the reheating affects the perturbations of various wavelengths , particularly the density perturbations . for those wavelengths @xmath0 observable in the variations of the cmbr the phase @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the reheat time , is extremely small .",
    "so the usual assumption is that for these wavelengths the effect of the transition on the perturbations can be well calculated by the sudden ( instantaneous ) approximation . in recent years",
    "there has been some discussion on this point @xcite.it is the main purpose of this paper to support the usual assumption by illustration using a well known inflationary scenario followed by a particular reheating mechanism .    the mechanism that we use",
    "is an old one @xcite , that of a friction term in the scalar field equation with the corresponding balancing term in the radiation fluid energy equation .",
    "we do not postulate this as a close representation of the actual physical process of reheating or defrosting , which is anyway not yet determined , but use it as a stand - in providing a balanced transfer of energy - momentum from one phase to another in a mixed phase state . in this latter respect",
    "it is more physically motivated than reheating representations which just interpolate the scale factor of the frw universe @xcite .",
    "the new feature is that the calculation of the transition from a universe of all scalar field to one of all radiation fluid is done explicitly for the perturbed as well as for the unperturbed case . in the former case",
    "the synchronous gauge is used for calculation .",
    "we find that the numerical results for the resulting perturbations in the radiation era are the same , to many significant figures , as those got in the sudden approximation by application of the lichnerowicz conditions @xcite on a hypersurface of constant energy density , as formulated by deruelle and mukhanov @xcite .",
    "this result serves to confirm the hypothesis ( and its implementation ) that the sudden phase transition happens on a hypersurface of constant energy density even where it is between entirely different types of physical states  in this case a scalar field and a standard type of perfect fluid .    in the following section we outline the model , setting out the scalar potential",
    "this is adjusted to give a period of power - law inflation , followed by a transition to zero scalar field , with the transition being mediated by a friction term . in section [ reheat ]",
    "we first derive the resulting equations for the reheating transition in which the scalar field matter of the universe is wholly converted into a radiation fluid and the universe enters the radiation era ; secondly we derive the equations for the development of the density perturbations , arisen by earlier quantum fluctuations , through the gradual reheating transition .",
    "section [ transitions ] is mainly on the numerical solution of these equations to give the resulting radiation era parameters ; for the perturbations we treat only wavelengths important for the observed fluctations of the cosmic microwave background . we also derive the corresponding radiation era perturbation for the sudden transition approximation , so as to compare this with the result of the gradual transition .",
    "we show that the two results are the same , to extremely good accuracy .",
    "the computations are done in the synchronous gauge , but the comparison of results for the sudden and gradual transitions are done using gauge invariant variables @xcite .",
    "we also include a discussion of the effect of our gradual transition mechanism on non - physical so called synchronous gauge modes - eliminable by a coordinate transformation using the residual gauge freedom of synchronous gauges @xcite .",
    "the metric tensor perturbations - gravitational waves - are a separate and much easier case and in [ transc ] we show analytically that the sudden transition approximation is valid also in this case .",
    "we choose a potential for the scalar field @xmath3 which gives constant power law inflation for large @xmath3 and which , in conjunction with a friction term , converts the scalar field energy into a perfect fluid as @xmath3 decreases .",
    "we take the fluid to be the usual one of the radiation era , so that the pressure and density are related by @xmath4 .",
    "the potential is given by @xmath5 @xmath6 ; \\phi < \\phi_{a}.   \\label{potenl2}\\ ] ] and is illustrated in the figure for the particular case where @xmath7,@xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the constants @xmath10 are adjusted so that @xmath11 are continuous at @xmath12 . the curvature , @xmath13 , changes sign at @xmath14 so that it is negative for @xmath15 where a friction term @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is an adjustable constant , is added to the equations as detailed below .    the scalar field decreases with time and in the power law inflation region,@xmath18 , the cosmic scale factor @xmath19 where @xmath20 is conformal and @xmath21 cosmic time .",
    "@xmath22 is a constant , @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 the field accelerates until some @xmath15 where the friction becomes large enough to slow it down ; finally the field energy is all converted into fluid energy .",
    "this model is just one realization of inflation followed by reheating and is designed to track coupled metric , scalar field and density perturbations through inflation to the end of reheating .",
    "these perturbations are supposed to arise from quantum fluctuations early in the inflationary era .",
    "they are accompanied by quantum fluctuations with graviton production giving rise to gravity waves which we shall likewise track through to the radiation era .",
    "we write the equations for the case where the radiation fluid and the scalar field are coexisting ; the pure scalar field era and the radiation era are just special cases of these equations . for @xmath18",
    "the model has an analytic solution but otherwise a numerically computed solution is necessary , even for this unperturbed case .",
    "the einstein equations are @xmath26 @xmath27    the right hand side being the sum of the energy - momentum tensors of the scalar field and of the fluid , with density @xmath28 and pressure @xmath29 and 4-velocity @xmath30 : @xmath31\\ ] ] @xmath32 to solve these equations the scalar field equation is also requisite . to the usual scalar equation",
    "we add a friction term so that it becomes @xmath33 where hubble , @xmath34 and we have used the notations @xmath35 @xmath36    from the einstein equations we obtain @xmath37.\\ ] ] the bianchi identities from the einstein equations combined with the scalar equation yield the fluid energy equation ; @xmath38 eqs .",
    "( [ scalareq],[hubble],[energyeq ] ) are sufficient to solve the model ; we note that as @xmath3 decreases kinetic energy is taken from the scalar field and given to the fluid .",
    "the einstein equations remain valid .    for calculation",
    "it is convenient to use @xmath39 as evolution parameter instead of @xmath20 and we use the notation @xmath40 .",
    "the equations of motion then become @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 where in the last equation we have used @xmath44 for the relativistic fluid . in these equations @xmath45 are given functions of @xmath3 only , and the solution of the equations gives @xmath46 as functions of @xmath47 only .",
    "we can find the value of @xmath20 as a function of @xmath48 and thus of @xmath49 by @xmath50    we note that the equations scale in the following sense : if we have a solution with a certain @xmath51 , eq.([potenl2 ] ) , with a certain @xmath52 and @xmath53 is any constant _ then _",
    "@xmath54 is also a solution .",
    "this is convenient because if we have a solution with a particular @xmath51 then , by adjustment of @xmath53 , we can get a solution appropriate to the era we wish to consider .      in this region @xmath55 and eqs.([scalareq2],[hubble2 ] ) yield @xmath56 the simplest solution is @xmath57 letting @xmath58 it follows that @xmath59,a \\propto ( \\tau -\\tau_{p})^{p } ,   p \\equiv 2/(\\lambda-2 ) , \\tau_{p } = constant$ ] . with @xmath60",
    "this is the well known power - law inflation due to an exponential potential .      in this region",
    "we need to use numerical compution to solve even the unperturbed equations whose solution we shall denote by @xmath61 . in our numerical computation the unperturbed solution and the perturbation to it are evolved simultaneously , and we proceed now to the formalism for this latter .",
    "perturbations to the energy - momentum tensor density are coupled to scalar perturbations of the metric tensor . for these",
    "we work in a synchronous coordinate system and follow in the main the formalism of grishchuk @xcite .",
    "the metric is @xmath62dx^{i}dx^{j}.\\ ] ] @xmath63 are the relevant perturbations which can be expressed as a linear superposition for the various wave numbers * k * of @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a superposition of the spatial wave function solutions @xmath66 so that @xmath67 . the total perturbation can be found by solving for @xmath68 and this we shall do .",
    "we write the * k*-components of the _ perturbation _ to the energy - momentum tensor as @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 , and where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are density and pressure perturbation components appropriate to * k*. then the perturbed einstein equations where the variables are functions of @xmath74 are @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 in what follows we shall denote the * k*-component perturbation to the scalar field by @xmath79 and the * k*-component fluid perturbations by @xmath80 and @xmath81 . for the perfect fluid ,",
    "which we assume , @xmath82 and the corresponding quantity vanishes for the scalar field ; so @xmath83 .",
    "the right hand sides of eqs.([perteinst1]-[perteinst4 ] ) are given by : @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 inserting these into the preceeding equations we have a set of differential equations capable of solution when we have added the following perturbed scalar field equation ; @xmath88 this equation combined with the ( perturbed ) bianchi identities yields the perturbed fluid energy equation as : @xmath89    as in the unperturbed case the physical assumption lies in the addition of the friction term to the scalar equation ; the einstein equations are preserved leading to the perturbed fluid energy equation , including the appropriate friction term which balances the one in the scalar equation .",
    "the initial conditions for solving the equations in the transition region , @xmath90 , are given by the solution at the end , @xmath91 , of the power law inflation in the region @xmath18 .",
    "in that region we already have the unperturbed solution in [ reheata1 ] and shall now use well - known analytic methods to get the perturbed solution .",
    "we shall use dotted quantities to denote differentiation with respect to @xmath20 ; for example @xmath92 from eqs.([perteinst2],[rhseinst2 ] ) @xmath93 it can be shown that for the scalar field only case @xcite @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 where , as defined in [ reheatb ] , @xmath97 .",
    "the scale factor is given by eq.([apowlaw ] ) so that @xmath98 .",
    "integration of eq.([eq.mu ] ) gives @xmath99 as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is an integration constant subsuming , when @xmath102 is constant , the lower limit of the integration .",
    "@xmath103 is a solution of @xmath104 which can be eliminated by a coordinate transformation allowed by the residual gauge freedom of the synchronous gauge @xcite ; it gives zero contribution to gauge invariant variables @xcite .",
    "we drop this term here but we shall revisit it later in conjunction with the results .",
    "all the above development was non - quantum mechanical .",
    "we shall now briefly remark on the quantum basis of the phenomena .",
    "we denote the corresponding quantum field theory quantities by a tilde : @xmath105 @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a quantum annihilation operator , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , is that solution of the bessel equation ( [ eq.ddotmu ] ) such that @xmath110 thus corresponding for large @xmath111 to the usual mode function of quantum mechanical plane waves .",
    "@xmath112 is a normalization factor whose determination gives the absolute magnitude of the observed density perturbations ( in terms of the model parameters ) given the assumption that these come from a primordial vacuum with zero quantum occupation number .",
    "n has been determined as @xcite @xmath113    for this paper , which is mainly about sudden transition versus gradual transition amplitudes , we do not need to discuss the quantum aspects further .",
    "we can now proceed with the evaluation of the metric scalar components at the end of inflation .",
    "the exact expression for the solution @xmath114 is , with @xmath115 , @xmath116 exact power - law inflation ends and the transition region begins at @xmath12 ; other variables at that surface,@xmath117 , we denote by the suffix @xmath117 . for example : @xmath118 . for small enough values of @xmath119",
    "we can expand @xmath120 given by eq.([eq.mu1 ] ) in an ascending power series and just consider the first one or two terms .",
    "our first interest is in values of @xmath111 of importance in cobe and other observations .",
    "these are of the order of magnitude ( the relevant meaning here is being within a few factors of ten ) of @xmath121 where @xmath122 denote the values of the scale factor and hubble at the time , @xmath123 , when the matter era begins .",
    "thus for such values of @xmath111 the values of @xmath119 are of order @xmath124",
    ". then we expand @xmath120 in a power series with leading terms @xmath125 @xmath126 the corresponding expansion of @xmath99 from eq.([eq.h ] ) , with @xmath127 , is @xmath128 we need these expressions at @xmath129 to find the initial values for the numerical solution of the coupled differential equations in @xmath130 .",

    "this and the initial conditions above lead us to rewrite the equations in terms of renormalized variables which are of order zero in @xmath141 .",
    "these are :    @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 .    except for @xmath147",

    "we shall omit the explicit @xmath151 terms because these are of order @xmath140 smaller than the other terms in the equation for both cases .",

    "it is necessary to know the unperturbed solutions @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 which enter the equations ; these are given by eqs.([scalareq2])- ( [ energyeq2 ] ) and their initial conditions at the beginning of reheating are given in [ reheata1 ] .",
    "we evolve all the variables , both the perturbed and the unperturbed , together as a set of coupled differential equations with evolution parameter @xmath74 .",
    "the end of the transition period and the beginning of the radiation era are signalled by @xmath154 arriving at a negligable value ; @xmath79 accompanies @xmath154 into oblivion .",
    "our objective is to compare the radiation era amplitudes resulting from this gradual transition to those resulting from a sudden transition .",
    "for this we use the matching conditions given by deruelle and mukhanov @xcite ; conditions ( their eqs .",
    "4.5a , b ) in the longitudinal gauge can equivalently be given in terms of the gauge invariant variable @xmath157 .",
    "they are that @xmath157 and @xmath158 are continuous across the matching surface @xmath159 : @xmath160 @xmath161 where @xmath162 @xmath163 additionally , more obviously , @xmath49 and @xmath164 must also be continuous across the surface .",
    "density perturbations can be described by the mode function @xmath165 , corresponding to the @xmath114 of the inflation era , such that @xcite @xmath166 in terms of the synchronous gauge variables @xmath167 and the gauge invariant variable @xmath157 is given by @xcite @xmath168 so that from eqs.([perteinst1]-[perteinst4 ] ) @xmath169 non - physical synchronous gauge modes ( that is of the form @xmath170 ) give zero contribution to both @xmath165 and @xmath157 .",
    "we write the solution of eq.([nu1 ] ) as @xmath171 so that @xmath172 @xmath173 from the continuity of @xmath157 and @xmath158 across the interface these expressions enable the determination of @xmath174 and thus the density perturbation in the radiation era .",
    "so we need the values of @xmath175 and @xmath176 from the inflationary era solutions . from eqs.([init1 ] , [ init3],[phih ] ) , interpreted now as being at the surface @xmath159 , we find that to lowest order in @xmath177 @xmath178 solving eqs.([cont1],[cont2 ] ) straightforwardly gives to lowest order @xmath179 for @xmath111 relevant to cmbr fluctuation observations @xmath180 is of order @xmath181 where @xmath182 and thus away from the interface the term in @xmath183 dominates the radiation era density perturbations .      for our reheating model , or any such continuous transition ,",
    "no question of sophisticated implementation of lichnerowicz conditions at an interface arises .",
    "there is no interface ; the physical variables arising from the solutions of the equations of motion are all continuous through space - time .",
    "we shall consider the case where the transition ends at the same surface , @xmath159 , as that of [ transb1 ] ; @xmath3 is negligable for @xmath184 and the system is in the radiation era .",
    "the transition begins at the end of pure power law inflation , @xmath185 .",
    "we note here that @xmath186 of eq.([sigma ] ) is a constant of the power - law inflation era .",
    "below we shall refer to a @xmath186 evaluated at @xmath187 at the end of power - law inflation at the beginning of the gradual transition ; while in [ transb1 ] we referred to @xmath186 evaluated at that appropriate ( sudden ) end of power - law inflation , @xmath188 ; these have the same name and are indeed the same numbers .",
    "the radiation era analysis is of course precisely the same as in [ transb1 ] , with eqs.([phih],[phinu ] ) giving @xmath189 so at the end of the transition , @xmath159 , which is the beginning of the radiation era @xmath190 @xmath191 putting into the rhs of the last two equations the computed values at the end of the transition we can find @xmath192 and @xmath183 . in fact , because of the very small magnitude of @xmath180 , the last equation implies that to lowest order in @xmath180 @xmath193 since otherwise @xmath194 would take a large value unattainable in the transition .",
    "the result we have arrived at is that for the continuous case the density perturbation in the radiation era is determined by the value of @xmath195 at the end of the gradual transition .    by numerical integration of eqs.([eq3]-[eq6 ] ) with the stated initial conditions we determine @xmath194 and @xmath196 in terms of @xmath186 using eq.([phih ] ) .",
    "we can then compare the results for @xmath183 and @xmath192 , determining the radiation era perturbations , from the sudden and gradual transitions .      for the sudden transition we have , eq.([cs1 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath197    for the gradual transition we denote @xmath198 so that @xmath199    thus if @xmath200 the two transitions agree .",
    "we have calculated the gradual transition for two values of the inflation power - law exponent , @xmath201 , each for a number of values of the friction coefficient , @xmath17 , with the results shown in the tables . it may be noted that for the larger values of @xmath17 , ( @xmath202 ) quoted the system grinds to a halt at the bottom of the potential well with no significant oscillations ; this of course does not resemble any usually envisaged reheat mechanisms @xcite . for smaller @xmath17 oscillations",
    "occur and it is found , as we would expect , that their number increases rapidly as @xmath17 decreases .",
    "our numerical computation methods fail for @xmath17 significantly smaller than the last value in the tables , @xmath203 .",
    "as stated previously the transition is deemed to have come to an end when the value of @xmath154 is sufficiently small .",
    "there is not a precise criterion and we display results for various values of @xmath204 .",
    "we see that always @xmath205 to very high accuracy , in agreement with the sudden transition .",
    "this establishes the agreement ( for appropriate wavelengths ) in the following sense : whether there is a sudden transition at red - shift @xmath206 or our type of gradual transition ending at @xmath206 , the resulting radiation era scalar perturbation is the same .      as set out in eqs.([eq.phi])-([eq.h ] ) there is in the inflationary era ( as in other eras ) a synchronous gauge mode given by @xmath207 where @xmath101 is a constant .",
    "this mode is non - physical as it contributes zero to the gauge invariant variable @xmath157 , given by eq.([phih ] ) , as well as to other gauge invariant variables , and also it can be eliminated by a coordinate transformation making use of the residual gauge freedom of synchronous gauges .",
    "whole these remarks justify our ommission of this term , we have investigated further so as to provide a comment on the mechanism of energy transfer inthe gradual transition of our model .",
    "our theory is a linear perturbation theory , so we can completely investigate the consequences of a synchronous gauge mode separately from the physical modes previously considered by inserting solely eq.([hsynch ] ) and its derivative and @xmath208 as the initial conditions in eqs.([eq3])-([eq6 ] ) .",
    "these correspond to zero @xmath157 in the inflation era . for a perfect , that is coordinate independent , perturbed transition mechanism in eqs.([eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] )",
    "the resulting @xmath157 in the radiation era would be zero .",
    "to give an idea of the magnitudes involved we can put , formally , @xmath209 at the beginning of the transition - that is as if this quantity began the transition with the same magnitude as the physical mode previously considered .",
    "we illustrate by giving two results , corresponding to the first and last lines of table i , for the value of @xmath157 at the end of the transition : @xmath210 @xmath211 the results for the physical mode were @xmath212 for whatever @xmath17 .",
    "( [ f4synch ] ) and ( [ f4synch ] ) illustrate firstly that there is a coordinate dependence in the transition mechanism when applied to the non - physical , coordinate dependent , perturbative mode and secondly that it decreases with @xmath17 .",
    "it is probable that other transition mechanisms expressible as terms in the lagrangian , such as some of those which have been invoked to investigate particle production in the reheat phase @xcite , would transmit only coordinate independent information into coordinate independent variables.however investigation of these would involve different formalisms and calculations .",
    "we would not expect any different answers for the physical modes .",
    "tensor perturbations are very much simpler to treat than scalar perturbations .",
    "after their generation by quantum fluctuations their development is governed solely by the cosmic scale factor @xmath49 .",
    "corresponding to eq.([eq.mutil ] ) we have in the power - law inflationary era @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the annihilation operator for the graviton with polarization @xmath0 and wave number @xmath215 , and the polarization tensor satisfies @xmath216 .",
    "@xmath114 given by eq.([eq.mu1y ] ) is a solution , appropriate to the quantum mechanics as in eq.([eq.limits ] ) , of the tensor mode equation @xmath217 this holds for any cosmic era , whatever may be the dynamics responsible for the particular form of @xmath218 and in the radiation era , beginning at @xmath219 , which defines @xmath159 , we can write its solution as @xmath220 where @xmath221 and @xmath222 are constants to be determined by continuity , as set out below .",
    "if we assume a sudden transition from inflation to the radiation era at @xmath219 the matching conditions that determine @xmath221 and @xmath222 are that @xmath120 and @xmath223 ( equivalently @xmath224 ) must be continuous across the interface ; the continuity of @xmath49 and @xmath225 is also a condition but we already hold these enforced as in [ reheatb ] @xcite . up to the second term of the power series expansion @xmath120",
    "is given by eq.([eq.mu1y ] ) and @xmath224 by @xmath226 and the required continuity gives @xmath227 @xmath228 due to the extreme smallness of @xmath229 for waves of observational interest @xmath222 dominates and to lowest order @xmath230 @xmath231      at the end of power - law inflation , beginning the gradual transition @xmath232 @xmath233 also we shall below use the fact ( see eq.([sigma ] ) ) that @xmath234 is a constant of the inflationary era .",
    "it is convenient to consider the function @xmath235 so that from eq.([eq.mugrav ] ) @xmath236 generally the solution is not trivial , but working to lowest order , putting @xmath237 , we get @xmath238 and , again to lowest order , at the end of the power - law inflation @xmath239 then @xmath0 is constant throughout the transition , @xmath240 , as it also is in the inflationary phase , though for different @xmath218 ; in both cases @xmath241 .",
    "this implies that , to lowest order , where @xmath120 and @xmath114 are the gradual transition and inflationary mode functions respectively : @xmath242 since @xmath243 .",
    "thus eqs.([g+0],[g-0 ] ) hold as in the sudden transition case .",
    "this establishes the same result for tensor perturbations as was established for scalar perturbations , and in the sense stated at the end of section [ transb3 ] . for scalar perturbations it was likewise justifiable to neglect terms of order @xmath177 in certain equations for waves with @xmath111 relevant to current observations .",
    "we may note that this easy way of finding the result in the tensor case is not only due to the relative simplicity of the governing equation ( [ eq.mugrav ] ) but also to the assumption that the inflation is power - law .",
    "however we would expect it to hold more generally .",
    "as the transition proceeds both the unperturbed , @xmath154 , and the perturbed , @xmath79 , scalar fields diminish so that at some sufficiently small value we can use the perfect fluid model of the radiation era . in the latter part of the radiation era , as the the matter era is approached , the amplitude of the density perturbation is specified by the single quantity @xmath244 , evaluated at the end of the transition .",
    "an extension of the length of the transition , specified in the tables by the number of e - foldings , can always give values of @xmath245 as small as we please until the computation runs out of numerical accuracy .",
    "we have chosen the varying examples in the tables to demonstrate that the lack of precision in the @xmath245 criterion is not important in the sense that @xmath246 is very near to 2 for many different end values of @xmath245 .",
    "though @xmath247 and @xmath248 vary in the third decimal place the @xmath249 is much more constant , and we can understand this : in the radiation era by eqs.([cs4],[nu3 ] ) @xmath250 and the first term is constant since @xmath251 and @xmath252 and an equivalent result would apply towards the end of the transition region .",
    "thus for the above calculations with small @xmath111 the value of @xmath253 is very constant over many e - foldings of the cosmic scale factor @xmath49 after the scalar field has decreased in magnitude by more than about 4 powers of 10 .",
    "this is a property of the early part of the radiation era and not a property of the particular transition mechanism adopted .",
    "having concurred with some other authors @xcite , through different considerations , that transition period detail has no influence on density perturbations important for the cmbr fluctations , we may ask for what wave numbers @xmath111 the detail is going to be important .",
