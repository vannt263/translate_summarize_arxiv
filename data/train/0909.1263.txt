    "the photometric and kinematic study of spiral galaxies provides a method to tackle the problems concerning their formation and evolution .",
    "a lot of observational data has been obtained in recent decades , especially with the advent of ccd arrays . over the last years",
    ", significant progress has been made in both observational and theoretical studies aimed at understanding the structure and evolution of galaxies .",
    "modern sky surveys ( 2mass , sdss , etc . ) provide information on the characteristics and spatial distribution of millions of galaxies . the large available amount of information has altered the face of modern extragalactic astronomy .",
    "many important tasks , including detailed photometric studies of the structure of nearby galaxies , can be now solved without additional observations by telescopes . here",
    "we focus on the surface photometry of spiral galaxies on the basis of the 2mass near - infrared survey .",
    "the parametrization of galaxies is a way to describe the multitude of normal galaxies without any peculiarities within their structure .",
    "various fitting functions are used to derive structural parameters of bulges and discs .",
    "traditional fitting functions for stellar discs include an exponential function ( de vaucouleurs 1959 , freeman 1970 ) and an inner - truncated exponential function ( kormendy 1977 ) .",
    "bulges are well described by the so - called srsic  profile that includes the de vaucouleurs profile as a special case ( srsic 1968 ) .",
    "the de vaucouleurs law , or @xmath13-law , was obtained empirically for elliptical galaxies ( de vaucouleurs 1948 ) and later for bulges of early - type galaxies ( de vaucouleurs 1959 ) .",
    "later it was shown that the srsic  law is preferable to fit spheroidal components of galaxies ( e.g. andredakis et al .",
    "the @xmath14-distribution of surface brightness of edge - on discs is exponential or the so called `` sech@xmath15-distribution '' ( van der kruit & searle 1981 ) .",
    "( all the mentioned functions are described in section  3 of this paper . )    in order to derive structural parameters of bulges and discs , we must perform photometric bulge / disc decomposition of galaxy images .",
    "there are numerous methods of such decomposition .",
    "the one - dimensional analysis of the surface - brightness distribution is the most commonly used method ( e.g. boroson 1981 ; kent 1985 ; baggett , baggett & anderson 1998 ; bizyaev & mitronova 2002 , hereafter bm02 ) .",
    "but as was shown by byun & freeman ( 1995 ) the one - dimensional decomposition procedure leads to strong systematic errors .",
    "the two - dimensional approach provides much better estimates of the structural parameters for each component of a galaxy .",
    "this method is powerful when we need to separate the non - axisymmetric structures ( bars , rings , spiral arms ) from axisymmetric components ( disc and bulge ) .    in recent decades",
    "a number of studies concerning structural properties of galaxies has been performed .",
    "the results of decompositions of near face - on disc dominated galaxies as well as of early - type galaxies were presented , for instance , by de jong ( 1996 ) .",
    "it was concluded that there is a correlation between structural parameters of discs and bulges .",
    "mllenhoff & heidt ( 2001 ) found similar correlations and speculated about the formation and evolution of spiral galaxies .",
    "graham ( 2001 ) performed a detailed analysis of low - inclination spiral galaxies and described many significant properties of their bulges and discs .",
    "other studies dealt with the correlation between the scalelengths of bulges and discs ( e.g. courteau et al .",
    "1996 ; de jong 1996 ) , the presence of additional morphological components such as bars , lenses , rings , inner bars and inner discs ( e.g. de souza , gadotti & dos anjos 2004 , sga04 hereafter ; castro - rodrguez & garzn 2003 ; laurikainen , salo & buta 2005 ; gadotti 2009 ) and the revision of morphological classification of galaxies ( sga04 ) .",
    "the fundamental plane ( fp ) of discs as well as the photometric plane of bulges were also widely discussed ( e.g. khosroshahi et al .",
    "2000a , b ; mllenhoff & heidt 2001 ; moriondo , giovanelli & haynes 1999 ) .    the main aim of our project is to perform decompositions of a large number of edge - on galaxies both of early and late types into bulges and discs .",
    "we chose this type of galaxies because they provide a unique possibility to obtain information about the vertical structure of galactic discs . in the edge - on view non - axisymmetric features such as bars , rings or spiral",
    "arms are not seen .",
    "on the other hand , the vertical distribution of light in edge - on galaxies allows us to study a thin disc , a thick disc and a stellar halo ( see e.g. yoachim & dalcanton 2005 ; seth , dalcanton & de jong 2005 ) .    unfortunately , there are some difficulties in studying edge - on galaxies . in the optical band",
    "we need to take into account the dust extinction in the plane of a disc .",
    "the distribution of dust is often unknown and it is hard to obtain true values of disc and bulge parameters .",
    "the advantage of nir observations is that the general extinction is drastically reduced , although we can not exclude it completely .",
    "nevertheless it is better to perform the decomposition of galaxies by using their images in red and infrared bands .",
    "using three ir bands for galaxy decomposition and subsequent statistical analysis of galaxy properties in all three bands encourages us in our suggestion that extinction problems are not very severe ( at least for general statistical correlations which are the subject of the present work ) . however , edge - on galaxies are rare in occurrence in contrast to face - on galaxies or galaxies with intermediate inclination angles . therefore , in order to create a large sample of edge - on galaxies it is necessary to use special catalogues which include a lot of edge - on spiral galaxies such as the revised flat galaxy catalog ( karachentsev et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "a detailed study of the disks of edge - on galaxies is described in many papers ( e.g. , van der kruit & searle 1981 ; reshetnikov & combes 1997 ; de grijs 1998 ) . in a more recent study ,",
    "dalcanton & bernstein ( 2000 , 2002 ) examined a sample of extremely late - type , edge - on spirals with no apparent bulges and concluded that thick disks are common around galaxy disks of all masses .",
    "bm02 also analyzed a sample of late - type edge - on galaxies in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2-bands to compare the mean ratios @xmath12 in these bands .",
    "they have noted a strong correlation between the central surface brightness of the disk and the @xmath12 ratio : the thinner the galaxy , the lower the central surface brightness reduced to the face - on inclination .",
    "kregel , van der kruit & de grijs ( 2002 ) , kregel ( 2003 ) , kregel , van der kruit & freeman ( 2005 ) and zasov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) presented a complex study ( dynamical properties of the stellar discs , three - dimensional disc structure , stellar kinematics , rotation curves ) of several dozens of edge - on spirals .",
    "unfortunately , there are no extended studies of structural parameters of edge - on galaxies both of early and late types which join analysis of their bulges and discs .",
    "our study is intended to fill this gap .",
    "we analyse the statistical properties of the sample edge - on galaxies and present correlations between the global structural parameters of _ bulges _ and _ discs _ , including those that describe their vertical structure , in the near - infrared bands .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we present the detailed description of our sample of spiral edge - on galaxies which includes the selection criteria and a brief description of the data sources .",
    "we also describe the completeness of the sample and its main properties . in section  3",
    "we use the two - dimensional least - squares algorithm to decompose the galaxy images into a bulge and a disc .",
    "we recall some aspects of the code budda ( sga04 ) which we used as the decomposition tool . in section  4 , we present the results of image decomposition in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2-bands .",
    "we compare our results with previous results from the literature and analyse the reliability of the results of the budda decompositions . in section  5",
    "we describe general properties of edge - on spiral galaxies and discuss some correlations between galactic subsystems .",
    "some of them are well - known but there are also some new results . in section  6",
    "we summarize our main conclusions . in the forthcoming papers we are going to discuss properties of edge - on galaxies in more detail .",
    "we intended to find edge - on galaxies with a wide range of bulges : from bulge - dominated spirals to galaxies with small bulges .",
    "we used the 2mass - selected flat galaxy catalog ( 2mfgc ) ( mitronova et al .",
    "2003 ) as a source of objects and the 2mass survey ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) as a source of image data .",
    "we also used the revised flat galaxies catalog ( rfgc ) by karachentsev et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to add late - type galaxies to our sample .",
    "the two micron all sky survey is one of the best known digital surveys in a wavelength range close to the optical one .",
    "this survey covers the whole sky in the filters @xmath0 ( 1.25 @xmath16 m ) , @xmath1 ( 1.65 @xmath16 m ) , and @xmath2 ( 2.16 @xmath16 m ) .",
    "unfortunately , the 2mass survey has a weak sensitivity to late - type galaxies , especially of low surface brightness ( jarrett 2000 ) .",
    "this is due to the high brightness of the night sky in the near - ir range and short exposures .",
    "for this reason the periphery of the discs of spiral galaxies is generally unseen beyond the isophotes fainter than @xmath17 mag arcsec@xmath18 .",
    "we did not study truncation radii for the 2mass - galaxies and did not take them into account performing the decomposition .",
    "the sample was selected mainly from the 2mfgc .",
    "this catalogue contains 18020 disc - like galaxies covering all the celestial sphere .",
    "the objects were taken from the extended source catalog of the 2mass ( xsc 2mass ) according to their 2mass axial ratio @xmath19 .",
    "the 2mfgc gives value of axial ratio @xmath20 , fiducial elliptical kron magnitude , position angle , the @xmath0-band concentration index ( @xmath21 ) and other useful information .",
    "concentration index is the ratio of the radii of circles that contain 3/4 and 1/4 of the measured flux in the same band , respectively . @xmath21",
    "together with @xmath20 are known to serve as dividing lines between early- and late - type galaxies ( see e.g. strateva et al .",
    "2001 ; nakamura et al .",
    "we decided to select galaxies both of early and late types in almost equal quantities .",
    "our criteria are    * axial ratio for the combined @xmath22 image , @xmath23 ; * @xmath24-band fiducial elliptical kron radius , @xmath25 ; * hubble type ranging from s0 to late types ; * non - interacting galaxies ; * concentration index @xmath26 .      from the set of 3167 objects which contains galaxies with pronounced bulges ( sa , sb types ) and galaxies with small bulges ( sc , scd types ) we selected a sufficient number of regular spiral galaxies to make statistical analysis of edge - on galaxies properties . we did not add to the sample galaxies that are clearly lopsided or warped ( with some exceptions below ) .",
    "in addition , on the basis of careful visual inspection we rejected non - edge - on and peculiar objects . also , we added 13 bright galaxies that were absent in the 2mfgc and several edge - on galaxies which were not selected according with foregoing criteria but were included in the sample of rfgc galaxies by bm02 .",
    "we chose them to compare the results of our decomposition with those obtained by bm02 .",
    "the final sample consists of 67 early - type galaxies ( s0-sab ) , 61 late - type galaxies ( sbc - sd ) and 47 galaxies of intermediate type sb .",
    "the absolute numbers of galaxies of various morphological types ( taken from the leda ) and their percentages are listed in the table  [ types ] .",
    "the full list of the sample galaxies studied here is presented in the appendix , where we provide the basic information about them . according to leda 23",
    "galaxies have bars , 6 galaxies have rings , and 3 objects are interacting galaxies .",
    "we did not take into account additional components like bars performing the decomposition , but checking all correlations between structural parameters , we did not find any strong deviation of the above - mentioned objects from derived trends .",
    "we also did not reject 3 interacting galaxies and several other galaxies with some unusual structural features ( double exponential discs , rings , etc . , which will be described in our resulting tables ) to have about 10 unusual spiral edge - on galaxies for further work .",
    "as can be seen in the table  [ types ] the sample contains a substantial percentage of lenticular galaxies .",
    "it is necessary to notice that hubble classification for edge - on galaxies is very subjective because the spiral arm structure is not seen in this case .",
    "the only way to classify edge - on galaxies according to morphological types is the estimation of the ratio of the total luminosities of a bulge and a disc ( hereafter @xmath29 ) .",
    "we assume that a large fraction of classified s0 galaxies are sa galaxies in fact . in fig .",
    "[ galexamples ] the images of typical sample galaxies are shown . according to the leda data , our sample galaxies are , on average , true highly - inclined galaxies with the mean inclination @xmath30 .",
    "of course , this estimate can be too optimistic but a moderate deviation from edge - on orientation does not significantly change the slope of the vertical surface brightness distribution ( barteldrees & dettmar 1994 ) ."

    "<S> the main conclusions of our general statistical analysis of the sample are :    \\(1 ) the distribution of the apparent bulge axis ratio @xmath6 for the subsample with @xmath3 can be attributed to triaxial , nearly prolate bulges that are seen from different projections , while @xmath4 bulges seem to be oblate spheroids with moderate flattening . </S>",
