    "hempel distance is a measure of complexity originally defined for heegaard splittings of @xmath2-manifolds @xcite .",
    "the definition can be extended to bridge decompositions of links and it has been successfully applied to knot theory .",
    "for example , extending hartshorn s @xcite study for heegaard splittings , bachman - schleimer @xcite showed that the distance of a bridge decomposition of a knot bounds from below the genus of any essential surface in the knot exterior . extending scharlemann - tomova s @xcite for heegaard splittings ,",
    "tomova @xcite showed that the distance of a bridge decomposition bounds from below the bridge number of the knot or the heegaard genus of the knot exterior .",
    "however , it is difficult to calculate the hempel distance of a general heegaard splitting or bridge decomposition . while estimating it from above is a simple task in principle , it is a hard problem to estimate the distance from below .    for a heegaard",
    "splitting , casson - gordon @xcite introduced the rectangle condition to ensure that the distance is at least two .",
    "lee @xcite gave a weak version of rectangle condition which guarantees the distance to be at least one .",
    "berge @xcite gave a criterion for a genus two heegaard splitting which guarantees the distance to be at least three .",
    "lustig - moriah @xcite also gave a criterion to estimate the distance of a heegaard splitting from below .",
    "on the other hand , we could not find corresponding results for bridge decompositions in literature . in this paper , we observe that a bridge decomposition of a link in @xmath1 can be described by a _ bridge diagram _ , and show that the _ well - mixed condition _ for a bridge diagram guarantees the distance to be at least two ( see section [ diagram ] for definitions ) .",
    "it may be regarded as a variation of the rectangle condition for heegaard diagrams .    [",
    "main ] suppose @xmath3 is an @xmath0-bridge decomposition of a link in @xmath1 for @xmath4 .",
    "if a bridge diagram of @xmath3 satisfies the well - mixed condition , the hempel distance @xmath5 is at least two .",
    "recently , masur - schleimer @xcite found an algorithm to calculate the hempel distance of a heegaard splitting with a bounded error term .",
    "the author imagine that their algorithm may also be appliable to bridge decompositions .",
    "however , the point of our result is its practicality : for any given bridge decomposition , we can easily obtain a bridge diagram and check whether it satisfies the well - mixed condition .",
    "suppose @xmath6 is a link in @xmath1 and @xmath7 is a @xmath8-sphere dividing @xmath1 into two @xmath2-balls @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "assume that @xmath6 intersects @xmath7 transversally and let @xmath11 be the intersection of @xmath6 with @xmath12 for each @xmath13 .",
    "that is to say , @xmath14 is decomposed into @xmath15 and @xmath16 by @xmath7 .",
    "we call the triple @xmath3 an _ @xmath0-bridge decomposition _ of @xmath6 if each @xmath17 is an @xmath0-string trivial tangle . here",

    "consider a properly embedded disk @xmath20 in @xmath12 .",
    "we call @xmath20 an _ essential disk _ of @xmath17 if @xmath21 is essential in the surface @xmath22 and @xmath20 is disjoint from @xmath11 . here",
    ", a simple closed curve on a surface is said to be _ essential _ if it neither bounds a disk nor is peripheral in the surface .",
    "note that essential disks of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are bounded by some essential simple closed curves on the @xmath25-punctured sphere @xmath26 .",
    "the essential simple closed curves on @xmath26 form a @xmath18-complex @xmath27 , called the _ curve graph _ of @xmath26 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath27 are the isotopy classes of essential simple closed curves on @xmath26 and a pair of vertices spans an edge of @xmath27 if the corresponding isotopy classes can be realized as disjoint curves . in the case of @xmath28 ,",
    "this definition makes the curve graph a discrete set of points and so a slightly different definition is used .",
    "the _ hempel distance _ ( or just the _ distance _ ) of @xmath3 is defined by @xmath29,[\\partial d_-])\\mid d_\\varepsilon \\text { is an essential disk of } t_\\varepsilon .\\",
    "( \\varepsilon = \\pm ) \\}\\ ] ] where @xmath30,[\\partial d_-])$ ] is the minimal distance between @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath32 $ ] measured in @xmath27 with the path metric . because the curve graph is connected @xcite ,",
    "the distance @xmath5 is a finite non - negative integer .    for @xmath8-bridge decompositions ,",
    "there is a unique essential disk for each of the @xmath8-string trivial tangles .",
    "moreover , the curve graph of a @xmath33-punctured sphere is well understood ( see sections 1.5 and 2.1 in @xcite for example ) and so we can calculate the exact distance .",
    "suppose @xmath3 is an @xmath0-bridge decomposition of a link @xmath6 for @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath34 , there are essential disks @xmath35 of @xmath36 , respectively , such that @xmath31=[\\partial d_-]$ ] .",
    "we can assume @xmath37 indeed and so @xmath38 is a @xmath8-sphere in @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 is separated by the sphere into an @xmath39-bridge decomposition and an @xmath40-bridge decomposition of sublinks of @xmath6 . by the definition of essential disks ,",
    "@xmath39 is more than @xmath41 and less than @xmath0 .",
    "conversely , we can conclude that the distance is at least one if @xmath3 is not a such one .",
    "suppose @xmath3 is an @xmath0-bridge decomposition of a link @xmath6 in @xmath1 and @xmath42 . for each @xmath13 ,",
    "the @xmath0 arcs of @xmath11 can be disjointly projected into @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath43 be such a projection .",

    "are the overpasses and the underpasses of @xmath6 .",
    "note that the boundary of a regular neighborhood of each arc of @xmath47 in @xmath7 bounds an essential disk of @xmath17 separating an arc of @xmath11 . in this sense",
    "a bridge diagram represents a family of essential disks of @xmath36 .",
    "so we can think of it as something like a heegaard diagram for a heegaard splitting .",
    "it is well known that a bridge decomposition is displayed as a  plat \" as in figure [ fig_braid ] ( see @xcite ) .",
