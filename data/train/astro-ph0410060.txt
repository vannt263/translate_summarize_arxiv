    "in the past several years great advances have been been made in revealing the nature of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) of relatively long duration , i.e. @xmath1 ( e.g. mszros 2002 ; zhang & mszros 2004 for recent reviews ) .",
    "however , another category of grbs , i.e. those with short durations ( i.e. @xmath2 ) , which comprise about 1/3 of the total grb population , have remained as mysterious as long grbs were before 1997 . this has been mainly due to the lack of afterglow detections for short grbs , until very recently .",
    "the leading progenitor model for short grbs invokes merger of two compact objects ( e.g. ns - ns merger or bh - ns merger , eichler et al .",
    "1989 ; paczyski 1991 ; narayan et al . 1992 ; mszros & rees 1992 ) , which has been found suitable to interpret many short grb properties ( ruffert et al . 1997 ; popham et al . 1999 ; perna & belczynski 2002 ; rosswog et al . 2003 ; aloy et al .",
    "2004 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the burst site is expected to have a large offset from the host galaxy due to asymetric kicks during the birth of nss ( bloom et al .",
    "1999 ; but see belczynski et al .",
    "2002 ) , so that the number density of the external medium in the grb environment is low , typically @xmath3 .",
    "alternatively , with the increasing evidence that long grb progenitors are collapsars , it has been suggested that short grbs may also be associated with collapsars , with either a less energetic jet ( i.e. short emerging model , zhang , woosley & macfadyen 2003 ) or a jet composed of many subjets seen by an off - axis observer looking into one or a few subjet(s ) ( subjets model , yamazaki , ioka & nakamura 2004 ) .",
    "if this is the case , the environment around the progenitor should be similar to that of long grbs , which is either a constant density medium ( e.g. panaitescu & kumar 2002 ; yost et al .",
    "2003 ) with ism number density @xmath4 or a prestellar wind ( e.g. chevalier & li 2000 ) .",
    "other possibilities for the origin of short grbs have been proposed within the cylindrical jet model ( wang et al .",
    "2004 ) and the poynting - flux dominated grb model ( lyutikov & blandford 2003 ) .    within the standard afterglow model and adopting a typical compact star merger environment ,",

    "we present a generic treatment of short grb optical afterglows which differs from the previous ones by including both the forward and the reverse shock emission , a crucial ingredient for characterizing the early afterglow light curve and the spectrum .",
    "the model is applied to various progenitor models and sample lightcurves are calculated which are compared against swift uvot sensitivity (  2 ) . lately , a short , soft burst grb 040924 was located by hete-2 , which led to the discovery of its optical afterglow ( fox & moon 2004 ) .",
    "we also apply the model to fit the afterglow data of this burst (  3 ) .",

    "swift uvot has a sensitivity of 24 mag during 1000s exposure time .",
    "scaling down with time , the sensitivity should be 19 mag for 10s exposure . unless the event is much closer or @xmath79 is larger , the rs emission is likely to be below the uvot sensitivity .",
    "the fs emission is quite similar to the numerical calculation of panaitescu , et al .",
    "because of a lower @xmath16 and a smaller @xmath13 , the r - band afterglow is much dimmer than that of typical long grbs , but it is still detectable by the uvot for at least a few hours . in the compact star merger scenario ,",

    "in the `` short emerging model '' ( zhang , woosley & macfadyen 2003 ) , physical parameters ( including the medium density @xmath16 and the jet opening angle @xmath81 ) are generally similar to the familiar long grbs , except that the isotropic energy is smaller .",

    "if an observer is far away from the jet axis and by chance is on the beam of one subjet , one detects a short burst .",
    "the global afterglow emission of this model could be then approximated by that of a gaussian structured jet superimposed on a uniform subjet .",
    "here we consider two emission components , one on - beam uniform less - energetic subjet with an opening angle @xmath94 ) , and another stronger and wider gaussian structured jet with typical gaussian angle @xmath95 with the line - of - sight angle @xmath96 off - axis . since the gaussian angular distribution is only of statistical sense in the subjet model ( yamazaki et al .",
    "2004 ) , around the subjet there could be a `` void '' where the emissivity is below the gaussian jet model in order to counterbalance the emissivity excess at the subjet .",
    "here we approximate this effect by adopting an annular void region of width @xmath97 around the subjet axis ( i.e. the emissivity is zero in the range from @xmath98 to @xmath99 . in view of the uncertainties ,",

    "for the subjet model , at the early times , the r - band emission is dominated by the on - beam subjet . as the subjet",
    "is decelerated so that the lorentz factor is of order @xmath98 , a very early jet break appears ( see fig [ fig : num ] for detail ) . on the other hand",
    ", the energetic gaussian core component contributes to the emission steadily , becomes progressively important at later times , and dominates the afterglow level after thousands of seconds . because of the progressively important core contribution , the afterglow decay in the subjet model is much slower than that in the short merging model .",

    "<S> short - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( @xmath0 ) have remained a mystery due to the lack of afterglow detection until recently . </S>",
    "<S> the models to interpret short grbs invoke distinct progenitor scenarios . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a generic analysis of short grb afterglows , and calculate the optical lightcurves of short grbs within the framework of different progenitor models . </S>",
    "<S> we show that all these optical afterglows are bright enough to be detected by the ultraviolet and optical telescope ( uvot ) on board the _ swift _ observatory , and that different models could be distinguished with a well - monitored lightcurve . </S>",
    "<S> we also model the afterglow data of the recently discovered short burst grb 040924 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the limited data are consistent with a low medium density environment which is consistent with the pre - concept of the compact - star merger progenitor model , although the models with a collapsar progenitor are not ruled out . </S>"
