    "x - ray binaries are the brightest x - ray sources in the sky . in these systems , a compact object which is either a white dwarf , a neutron star or a black hole , and a normal star which is in the process of evolution , revolve around the common centre of mass . depending on the mass of the binary companion",
    ", these systems are classified into two types such as ( a ) low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; mass of the companion @xmath0 m@xmath1 ) and ( b ) high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ; mass of the companion @xmath2 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "the hmxbs contain massive and early - type ( o or b - type ) companion stars where as in case of lmxbs , the spectral type of the binary companion is a - type or later .",
    "it is seen that the hmxbs are generally concentrated towards the galactic plane in contrast to the lmxbs which are found near the galactic centre , galactic bulge , in the galactic plane , and also in the globular clusters in the halo .",
    "mass - accretion takes place from the binary companion to the compact object through roche - lobe overflow ( in case of lmxbs ) or / and capture of stellar wind of the companion ( in case of hmxbs ) . as the binary companion evolves and fills the roche - lobe , mass transfer takes place from the companion star to the compact object through the inner lagrange point . in case of most hmxbs , however , the dominant process of mass accretion from the companion to the compact object is by the capture of the stellar wind of the companion .",
    "the accreted mass then spirals around the compact object forming a disk like structure , known as an accretion disk , before falling on to the compact object .",
    "the gravitational pull of the neutron star or black hole in the binary system accelerates the matter to extremely high velocities .",
    "the accelerated matter approaches the compact star , and if it has a stellar surface , most of the kinetic energy of the accreted material is converted to thermal energy which is radiated away primarily in the x - ray energy band . in some cases ,",
    "especially if the compact star does not have a strong magnetic field , there can also be a outflow in the form of a collimated jet from the compact star or a disk wind .",
    "the hmxb systems are strong x - ray emitters by the process of accretion of matter from the ob companion . based on the type of the companion star",
    ", these systems are further classified into be / x - ray binaries and supergiant x - ray binaries .",
    "the be / x - ray binaries represent the largest subclass of high mass x - ray binaries .",
    "about 2/3 of the identified systems fall into this category . in these systems ,",
    "the optical counterpart of the neutron star is either a dwarf , subgiant or a giant ob star ( luminosity class of iii , iv or v ) which shows spectral lines in emission .",
    "the mass donor in the be binary systems is generally a b star that is still on the main sequence and lying well inside the roche surface . in these",
    "be binary systems , the compact object ( almost always a neutron star ) is typically in a wide orbit with moderate eccentricity with orbital period in the range of 16400 days .",
    "evolutionary calculations show that be star and white dwarf or be star and black hole should also be common types of systems .",
    "however , no clear evidence of existence of such systems has been shown as yet ( zhang , li & wang 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "mass transfer from the be companion to the neutron star takes place through the equatorial circumstellar disc thought to be formed from the matter expelled from the rapidly rotating be star .",
    "the neutron star in these systems spends most of the time far away from the circumstellar disc surrounding the be companion .",
    "the x - ray spectra of these be / x - ray binaries are usually hard .",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum along with the transient nature are important characteristics of the be / x - ray binaries .    in case of supergiant x - ray binaries ,",
    "the optical counterpart is a star of luminosity class of i or ii . in these systems , the compact object orbits around the supergiant early - type star which is deep inside the highly supersonic wind .",
    "the optical companion emits a substantial stellar wind with a mass loss rate of 10@xmath310@xmath4 m@xmath1 yr@xmath5 with a terminal velocity up to 2000 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the supergiant x - ray binaries are further subdivided into two groups according to the dominant mode of mass transfer : ( a ) capture of the stellar wind of the optical companion and ( b ) roche lobe overflow . in some of these systems",
    ", both types of mass transfer may be taking place ( blondin , stevens & kallman 1991 ) .",
    "although capture from a high - velocity stellar wind is inefficient , the large mass - loss rate in the wind can result in an appreciable mass accretion rate onto the neutron star that is sufficient to emit radiation in x - ray band .",
    "vela  x-1 is the well known wind - fed supergiant x - ray binary pulsar . in case of roche lobe overflow",
    ", the mass donor fills its roche lobe and results in transfer of material from the companion to the neutron star through the first lagrange point and forms an accretion disk around the neutron star .",
    "this is a very efficient form of accretion and results in a mass transfer rate much larger than by capture of the wind alone .",
    "the x - ray photons emitted from the compact object through either of the accretion processes , must propagate through the stellar wind to the observer , which causes absorption , scattering and reprocessing of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "some of the supergiant x - ray binaries in which the roche lobe overflow is the dominant mode of mass accretion , are usually persistent x - ray sources .",
    "smc  x-1 , lmc  x-4 and cen  x-3 are amongst the best candidates for the disk - fed ( via roche lobe overflow ) supergiant x - ray binary pulsars .",
    "most of the high mass x - ray binaries are transient sources that are usually quiescent and occasionally become x - ray bright for a duration of a few days to several tens or hundreds of days . during the peak of the outburst , some of these sources are among the brightest x - ray sources in the sky . during the x - ray outbursts , the x - ray brightness / luminosity of some of the transient sources increases by up to four to five orders of magnitudes .",
    "the huge range of luminosity change makes these objects interesting to study in x - ray bands . while the x - ray bursts , outbursts , flares are generally transient and unpredictable , the be / x - ray transients often show regular and periodic outbursts on time scales in the range of tens of days to several hundreds of days , same as their orbital periods .",
    "the be / x - ray binaries display two types of x - ray outbursts such as type  i and type  ii outbursts .",
    "type  i outbursts are short and periodic outbursts of moderate luminosity ( @xmath6 erg  s@xmath5 ) which occur close to the time of periastron passage of the neutron star in the wide eccentric orbit .",
    "this suggests an enhanced accretion caused by the proximity of the neutron star to the be star companion at periastron .",
    "these outbursts last for a few days to tens of days and are different from the type  ii outbursts which are caused by enhanced episodic outflow of the be star .",
    "type  ii outbursts , are infrequent giant outbursts with peak luminosities reaching as high as @xmath7 erg  s@xmath5 or more . these outbursts last for several weeks to months .",
    "the timing of these outbursts is not related to any underlying orbital period of the system .",
    "these type  ii outbursts occur when a large fraction of the be star s disk is believed to be accreted .",
    "the type  i outbursts , though they occur only around the time of the periastron passages , do not occur in all the binary orbits and often a series of type  i outbursts are seen following a large type  ii outburst .",

    "the mechanism producing these short outbursts is still being debated .",
    "it is probably related to either the properties of the wind from the supergiant companion ( negueruela et al .",

    "we also briefly discuss the optical / ir properties of the transient hmxbs during the outbursts and mention the potential of the upcoming mission astrosat in furthering investigations of this important class of sources .",
    "the transient hmxbs show change of x - ray intensity by several orders of magnitudes during the outbursts , most likely due to changes in the mass accretion rate .",
    "this allows probe of several features like the pulse shape , accretion torque , quasi - periodic oscillations , energy spectrum , cyclotron absorption features in the spectrum over a large range of x - ray luminosity .",
    "changes in the mass accretion rate is expected to cause changes in the accretion process in a complex way , for example by changes in the inner disk radius , accretion torque , height of the accretion column , x - ray beaming pattern , and even temperature of the electrons that produce the hard x - rays by compton up - scattering . in the last few years , availability of several medium and hard x - ray transient monitors , several narrow field x - ray instruments with excellent timing and spectral capabilities and wide energy coverage , and intense observation programs have enabled very detailed investigations of transient hmxbs .",

    "accretion - powered x - ray pulsars , both transient and persistent sources , are known to show luminosity dependence of the pulse profile .",
    "differences in shape of x - ray pulse profiles are considered to be due to the differences in the geometrical configuration of the accretion column around the magnetic axis ( nagase 1989 ) .",
    "the structure of the accretion column near the magnetic poles of the neutron star determines the basic profile of the pulse pattern .",
    "a most remarkable example of pulse profile evolution was investigated in exo  2030@xmath8375 ( parmar , white & stella 1989 ) .",
    "the evolution of the pulse profile during the outbursts indicates changes in the accretion flow from the inner accretion disc to the neutron star . along with the luminosity dependence ,",
    "most of the accretion - powered pulsars also show strong energy dependence of the pulse profile , discussed in section 4 .",
    "luminosity dependence of pulse profiles are seen in several transient hmxb pulsars . in one of the nearby and brightest be / x - ray binary pulsar a0535@xmath8262",
    ", the pulse profile is known to be single peaked during the quiescent phase ( mukherjee & paul 2005 ) whereas it is double - peaked and complex during the x - ray outbursts ( naik et al .",

    "an extensive study of the pulse profiles of the recent outbursts of two transient pulsars gx  304@xmath131 and 1a  1118@xmath1361 showed significant evolution during the outburst ( devasia et al .",

    "apart from the energy and luminosity dependence of pulse profiles , dips or dip - like features in the pulse profiles are also seen in many transient x - ray pulsars .",
    "the presence of dips / dip - like structures in the pulse profiles of these x - ray pulsars is described as due to the obscuration of x - ray radiation from the region near the magnetic poles by dense matter in the accretion streams along which the matter flows from the inner accretion disk to the neutron star .",
    "the associated spectral signatures of this are discussed in section 4 .      in accretion powered binary x - ray pulsars ,",
    "the flow of material from the companion star to the neutron star is interrupted when the magnetic stress starts dominating over the material stresses at the magnetospheric radius @xmath16 .",
    "matter becomes attached to the magnetic field lines at @xmath16 and gets transported to the magnetic poles of the neutron star .",
    "the torque of the infalling material captured from the accretion disk and the torque transferred by the accretion disk to the neutron star through the magnetic field lines cause changes in the neutron star spin - rate . at high mass accretion rate , during the outbursts , the neutron stars experience an accretion torque which leads to spinning up of the neutron star . at low accretion rate , like during the quiescent period between the outbursts , the neutron stars often experience net negative torque ( bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ) . at very low accretion rates ,",
    "if the magnetospheric radius lies outside the corotation radius @xmath17 , where the keplerian orbital frequency equals the spin frequency of the neutron star , matter may be expelled from the system . in such cases ,",
    "accretion can be centrifugally inhibited which is called `` propeller effect '' . during this regime ,",
    "the neutron star spins down rapidly and pulsations may not even be detectable",
    ". in several cases , disappearance of pulses at low flux rate have been shown as evidence of the propeller effect ( cui 1997 and references therein ) . however , there are also counter examples ( mukherjee & paul 2005 ; naik , paul & callanan 2005 ) . due to this complex nature of the relation between the mass accretion and net torque onto the neutron star , the transient sources are very good candidates to study the interaction between material in the accretion disk and the magnetic field through measurements of rate of change of spin period and x - ray luminosity .",
    "the accretion torque theory predicts that the magnetospheric radius should decrease with increase in the rate of mass accretion as per the relation @xmath18 for @xmath19 ( ghosh & lamb 1979 ) .",
    "this implies that a neutron star spins up with a rate related to the mass accretion rate as @xmath20 .",
    "such a dependence was tested in several transient x - ray pulsars .",

    "the analytical form of the partially covering high energy cutoff power - law model is @xmath38 where @xmath39 @xmath40 is the measured spectrum , @xmath41 is the photon index , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the two equivalent hydrogen column densities , @xmath44 is the photo - electric cross - section , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the normalizations of the two power law components , @xmath47 is the cut - off energy and @xmath48 the @xmath49-folding energy .",
    "according to this model , a part of the continuum source is obscured , resulting in a harder spectrum .",
    "if the absorbing component is in the form of an accretion stream or is a part of the accretion column , it can be phase locked with the neutron star , resulting into a phase - dependent column density and covering fraction . at higher energy , however , the partial covering absorption model is the same as a simple power - law model . some results from pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of transient pulsars",

    "are required .",
    "spectral evolution during the outbursts has been detected in several transient sources , in the simple form of change in hardness ratio ( reig 2008 ) .",
    "detailed study of spectral evolution during the outbursts have recently been carried for a few sources .",
    "extensive _ rxte _",
    "observations of the transient hmxb pulsar gx  304 - 1 during an outburst in 2010 august was reported by devasia et al .",
    "( 2011b ) .",
    "they found that the 330 kev spectrum was well fitted with a partial covering power law model with a high energy cut - off and iron fluorescent line emission .",
    "significant spectral evolution was seen during the outburst . the ratio of the spectra during the entire outburst to the spectrum on one epoch ( close to the peak of the outburst ; as shown in fig .  [ gx304_sr ] )",
    ", showed the softening of the spectrum below @xmath50 kev and hardening beyond @xmath51 kev , during the decay of the outburst .",
    "similar spectral evolution during the transient outbursts in hmxb pulsars has also been studied in 1a  1118@xmath1361 ( devasia et al .",
    "the spectral changes indicate corresponding changes in the emission region with variations in the mass accretion rate .",
    "x - ray binary pulsars are known to have very strong surface magnetic fields in the range of 10@xmath5210@xmath53 gauss .",
    "the surface magnetic field strengths can be most accurately determined by measuring quantized electron cyclotron resonance features corresponding to transition between adjacent landau levels , which are separated by @xmath54 ( kev ) , where @xmath55 is the magnetic field strength in the unit of 10@xmath52 gauss and @xmath56 is the gravitational redshift . in case of pulsars with magnetic field strength @xmath55 in the range of 1 to 10 , @xmath57 falls in the hard x - ray energy ( 10100 kev ) range .",
    "therefore , detection of spectral absorption features at this resonance , called cyclotron resonant scattering feature ( crsf ) is a powerful tool to accurately determine the pulsar magnetic fields . using this spectral feature ,",
    "the surface magnetic fields of about 15 binary pulsars have been accurately measured with several x - ray observatories such as _ bepposax _ , _ rxte _ , _ suzaku _ and _ integral_. ( coburn et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the energy spectrum of be / x - ray binary pulsar a0535@xmath8262 showing the presence of crsf along with other model components is shown in fig .  [ a0535_spec ] .",
    "most of these pulsars are in transient hmxb systems .",
    "another very interesting phenomenon in accreting x - ray pulsars is that several pulsars show luminosity dependent changes in the cyclotron resonance energy .",
    "some are 4u  0115@xmath863 , a0535@xmath8262 , x0331@xmath853 , her  x-1 ( nakajima et al .",
    "2006 ; terada et al.2006 ; nakajima , mihara & makishima 2010 and references therein ) . in the case of transient pulsars 4u0115@xmath863 and x0331@xmath853 ( v0332@xmath853 ) ,",
    "the cyclotron resonance energy has been found to correlate negatively with the source luminosity .",
    "the anti correlation between the x - ray luminosity and the cyclotron resonance energy is understood as a result of a decrease in the accretion column height , in response to a decrease in the mass accretion rate .",
    "higher the luminosity , lower in energy is the crsf produced .",
    "this is because , higher luminosity implies higher accretion rate and a larger height of the accretion column .",
    "the crsf feature is thus produced further away from the surface of the neutron star ( nakajima et al .",
    "2006 ) where the local dipole magnetic field is smaller .",
    "however , the anti - correlation is not seen in all the sources and the reason for this is not yet very clear .",
    "several of the x - ray observatories provide very good coverage in observation of the transient sources during their outbursts , either due to very flexible planning and maneuvering ( _ rxte_-pca , _",
    "swift_-xrt ) or due to the wide angle coverage ( _ integral_-ibis , _ swift_-bat ) .",
    "this has enabled detailed studies of the timing and spectral properties over the long outburst periods of the hmxb transients .",
    "the large photon collection area of the _ rxte _ and _ suzaku _ also allow detailed pulse phase resolved spectroscopy or energy resolved pulse profile studies and some important results obtained in the recent years are briefly discussed here .      in transient accreting x - ray binary pulsars which show large variation in the rate of mass accretion during the x - ray outburst , it is found that the pds break frequency follows the variations of the x - ray flux .",
    "this represents the changes of the magnetospheric radius with the mass accretion rate ( revnivstev et al .",
    "the increase in the mass accretion rate results in decreasing the size of the magnetosphere and hence the inner radius of the disk which brings the system away from the corotation , so that the characteristic frequency at the inner edge of the disk / flow increase .",
    "this has been verified by examining the pds of transient x - ray binary pulsars such as a0535@xmath8262 , 4u  0115@xmath863 , v0332@xmath853 , ks  1947@xmath8300 ( revnistev et al .",
    "2009 ; reig 2008 ) .",
    "it was found in these systems that the break frequency in the pds changes with the x - ray luminosity as @xmath58 which agrees with the standard theory of accretion onto magnetized compact objects .",
    "investigation of the timing and spectral variability of accreting be / x - ray binary pulsars during major outbursts inferred that the transient be binaries exhibit two branches in the colour - colour and colour - intensity diagrams .",
    "these are the horizontal branch corresponding to a low - intensity state showing the highest fractional rms , and the diagonal branch that corresponds to a high - intensity state during which the source stays for about 75% of the total duration of the outburst .",
    "though the power density spectra of be / x - ray binary pulsars are complex due to the peaks of the pulse period and its harmonics , the aperiodic variability can generally be described with low number of lorentzian components ( reig 2008 ) . analyzing the colour - colour diagram and power density spectra of 4u  0115@xmath863 , ks  1947@xmath8300 , exo  2030@xmath8375 and v0332@xmath853 , it was found that the spectral - timing behaviour in be / x - ray binaries shows the existence of spectral branches in the colour - colour and colour - intensity diagrams . at high and intermediate flux , the sources move along the diagonal branch ; at very low count rate the soft colour decreases , while the hard colour remains fairly constant defining a horizontal branch .",
    "the low - intensity states are found to be more variable in terms of fractional rms .",
    "luminosity and energy dependence of pulse profiles are seen in several transient hmxb pulsars .",
    "the pulse profiles of many transient sources show very strong energy dependence , often a multiple - peaked profile at soft x - ray energy bands ( @xmath59 kev ) and a single - peaked or double - peaked smooth profile at hard x - rays ( for example gro  j1008@xmath1357 ; fig .",
    "[ j1008_pp ] ; naik et al.2011a ) . among some of the recent transients , the pulse profiles of gx  304@xmath131 ( fig .",
    "[ gx304 - 1 ] ) , 1a  1118@xmath1361 , and a0535@xmath8262 were found to be strongly energy dependent .",
    "sometimes , the energy dependence also evolves during the outbursts .",
    "an interesting feature that appeared from the energy resolved pulse profiles of many pulsars is dip - like features in the pulse profiles . from pulse phase",
    "resolved spectroscopy , the dips are found to be due to a partial obscuration of the x - rays by matter that is phase locked to the neutron star .",
    "it has been found that the broad - band spectrum of transient hmxbs which show dip - like features in the pulse profiles , is well described by partial covering absorption model .",
    "there are cases where the phase averaged broad - band spectrum of pulsars was well described by several continuum models .",
    "however , a partial covering absorption model was found to be more suited over the power - law with high energy cut - off or npex model to fit the pulse - phase resolved spectra . as it is already described , in many cases , the power law with high energy cut - off , npex and/or partial covering absorption models were all statistically fitting well to the broad - band continuum spectra of transient pulsars such as gro  j1008@xmath1357 ( naik et al .",

    "2011b ) . while investigating the characteristics of the above pulsar at certain phases where dips or dip - like features were present in the energy dependent pulse profiles , pulse phase resolved spectroscopy showed that partial covering absorption model described the pulsar spectrum well at almost entire pulse phase ranges . considering these results ,",
    "the partial covering absorption model was preferred while interpreting the results from pulse averaged spectroscopy .",
    "pulse phase resolved spectral analysis showed an increase in the value of absorption column density of the partial covering component and variation in the covering fraction during the dips or dip - like features in the pulse profile of the pulsars .",
    "the changes in the values of column density ( @xmath60 ) and the covering fraction during the dips in the pulse profiles naturally explain the energy dependence of the pulse profiles in transient hmxb pulsars .",
    "the changes in other spectral parameters such as iron emission line parameters , power law photon index are also seen in dip pulse phases compared to other pulse phases of the pulsars .",

    "phase resolved spectroscopy of crsfs in x - ray pulsars , sufficiently long observations with detectors of excellent capability at hard x - rays are required . pulse phase dependence of the crsf is known in a few sources ( e.g. vela x-1 : kreykenbohm et al .",
    "2002 , 4u 1907@xmath809 : rivers et al .  2010 ; gx 301@xmath132 : heindl et al .",
    "recently , pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of the crsf in 1a  1118@xmath1361 was carried out using the _ suzaku _ observation of this pulsar during its 2009 january outburst ( maitra et al .",
    "a remarkable dependence of cyclotron energy and depth with pulse phase has been found in 1a  1118@xmath1361 . in this source ,",
    "the cyclotron energy and depth show a variation of about 10 kev and by a factor 3 , respectively , over the entire pulse phase .",
    "a pulse phase dependence of the crsf is expected because of the simple fact that at different pulse phases the dipole geometry is being viewed at different angles .",
    "this has importance in understanding the emission pattern , both spectroscopic and geometric , from the accretion columns at the magnetic poles .",
    "however , some deep and sharp pulse phase dependent features in the crsf may also imply a more complex underlying magnetic field structure .",
    "a new class of hmxbs has emerged in the last several years , which consists of a compact star and a supergiant companion star . the remarkable feature of the sfxts is their fast transient nature and several models",
    "have been proposed to explain this feature .",
    "most of these binaries have wide orbits , very low x - ray luminosity during the quiescent period , and x - ray pulsations have been detected in few of these sources .",
    "one sfxt that stands out among all others is , igr  j16479@xmath134514 ( jain , paul & dutta 2009a ) with the smallest known orbital period of 3.32 d among the sfxts and quiescent x - ray luminosity of @xmath61 erg s@xmath5 , about two orders of magnitude brighter than the other sfxts in quiescence .",
    "however , igr j16479@xmath134514 is much fainter than the persistent hmxbs with similar orbital period and is thus thought to be a link between the persistent hmxbs and the sfxts while the sfxts themselves are a link between the systems with supergiant companions and the be x - ray binaries . regarding the nature of the outbursts in the sfxts , their duty cycle of the active period has been measured in several systems using extensive monitoring programs ( sidoli et al .",
    "there is evidence that the outbursts take place more frequently in certain orbital phases compared to the rest of the binary periods ( jain , paul & dutta 2009b ) and this has implication for understanding of the sfxt mechanism .",
    "the optical companion of transient hmxb pulsars , specifically be / x - ray pulsars are b - emission ( be ) spectral - type stars and are characterized by high rotational velocities .",
    "these stars rotate at a speed close to critical limit so that the surface gravity mostly balances with the centrifugal force around the equator .",
    "the episodic equatorial mass loss in this type of stars forms a circumstellar envelope , called a be disk , that orbits around the star .",
    "the be stars show complicated line profiles containing an absorption component from the photosphere and an emission component from the circumstellar disk .",
    "the emission line profiles which reflect the nature of the circumstellar disk , show many kinds of variabilities on the time scales from days to several years viz .",
    "complete disappearance or truncation , evolution of the circumstellar disk , changes in line profiles ",
    "double peaked profiles etc .",
    "the change in line profiles in be / x - ray binaries was explained due to the change in electron density in a region close to the be star , triggered by uneven mass loss from the optical companion .    during x - ray outbursts in transient be / x - ray binary systems , there are several occasions when",
    "extreme changes in line profiles of be stars have been reported .",
    "the disappearance of the h@xmath62 emission line is generally used as a strong indicator for disk loss in be stars .",
    "corbet , smale & menzies ( 1986 ) found the h@xmath62 profile to change from a shell profile to an absorption profile over a period of four years in the be / x - ray binary source 4u  1258 - 61 ( gx  304 - 1 ) . in case of",

    "july ( negueruela et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this was associated with a low photometric state in infrared magnitudes .",
    "the circumstellar disk formed again after the disk loss episode within a period of about 6 months .",
    "disk loss in another transient hmxb pulsar a0535@xmath8262 was inferred from a change in h@xmath62 emission profile to absorption during 1997 october  1998 august ( haigh et al .",
    "it was also found that the hydrogen lines like br@xmath63 in absorption on 1998 november , which is associated with disk loss event . the h@xmath62 line profile was found to show remarkable variability during the giant x - ray outburst of a0535@xmath8262 in 2009 november  december indicating the existence of a warped component ( moritani et al .",

    "be / x - ray binaries , the circumstellar disk loss phenomenon , related changes in the emission line features in optical and near - infrared spectra and the re - formation of the disk can occur over a period of a few days / weeks to months / years .",

    "<S> high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) are interesting objects that provide a wide range of observational probes to the nature of the two stellar components , accretion process , stellar wind and orbital parameters of the systems . </S>",
    "<S> a large fraction of the transient hmxbs are found to be be / x - ray binaries in which the companion be star with its circumstellar disk governs the outburst . </S>",
    "<S> these outbursts are understood to be due to the sudden enhanced mass accretion to the neutron star and is likely to be associated with changes in the circumstellar disk of the companion . in the recent years , another class of transient hmxbs have been found which have supergiant companions and show shorter bursts . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray , infrared and optical observations of these objects provide vital information regarding these systems . here </S>",
    "<S> we review some key observational properties of the transient hmxbs and also discuss some important recent developments from studies of this class of sources . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray properties of these objects are discussed in some detail whereas the optical and infrared properties are briefly discussed .    </S>",
