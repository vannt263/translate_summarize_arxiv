    "in supersymmetric models , the scalar sector of the theory features multiple higgs bosons . in the minimal susy scenario , which requires two higgs doublets ,",
    "the phenomenology features three neutral higgs bosons and one charged higgs boson pair .",
    "however , if multiple higgs particles are discovered in the absence of evidence of squarks or other susy partners , it will not be immediately apparent what symmetries govern these phenomena .",
    "because a generic two - higgs - doublet - model ( 2hdm ) produces unrealistically large flavor - changing neutral currents , naturalness arguments would lead one to expect that some of symmetry is present in the higgs sector , but the symmetry need not be associated with susy . in this paper we examine a generic 2hdm in a formalism that does not impose symmetries on the scalar sector , as in .",
    "absent such symmetries , all physical observables must be basis - independent ( invariant with respect to transformation in higgs - flavor space ) .    in the case that the scale of the new physics is not too much larger than the z boson mass , the 2hdm produces non - zero shifts of the oblique parameters s , t , and u as well as the higher - order parameters v , w , and x. in this paper we calculate the six parameters in the 2hdm and randomly sample the 2hdm parameter space to compare the predictions of the model to the experimental results .",
    "the goal of this work is to present basis - independent formulae for the extended parameters ( v , w , and x ) and to answer the following questions : how do the values generated in the 2hdm for the oblique parameters compare with the experimental values ? does the 2hdm predict significant shifts in the higher - order parameters ?",
    "( ie , is any additional information provided by going beyond s , t , and u ? ) what do these results for the oblique parameters reveal about the phenomenology ( neutral and charged scalar masses ) of the 2hdm ?",
    "we also examine factors that may affect the validity of our results , such as the differences between the various definitions of the oblique parameters appearing in the literature , the effect of our choice of @xmath5 ( an unconstrained parameter in the scalar potential ) on the size of the scalar masses , the errors inherent in using experimental limits from the pdg that use a fixed reference mass , and the extent to which taking the cp - conserving limit changes the numerical results .",
    "the theory of a basis - independent cp - violating 2hdm has been developed in .",
    "what follows is a brief summary of the elements of the theory that will be relevant for the calculations in this paper .",
    "the most generic scalar potential for a model of two higgs doublets is [ genericpot ] = y_a_^_b + z_ac(_^_b ) ( _ ^_d ) , where the higgs doublet fields are written as @xmath6 , with @xmath7 ; complex conjugation converts a barred index to unbarred and vice versa .",
    "the fields @xmath8 can be redefined by an arbitary u(2 ) transformation which rotates them to a different basis in higgs flavor space .",
    "the coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 in are likewise basis - dependent .",
    "any measurable parameters of the 2hdm must be invariant with respect to such a transformation .",
    "invariants can be constructed by summing over all higgs flavor indices , pairing unbarred and barred indices , as is done in the covariant equation [ genericpot ] .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of the higgs doublets are [ emvev ] _ a = (    c 0 + v_a    ) , where @xmath11  gev and @xmath12 is a vector of unit norm .",
    "one can define new doublet fields as follows : [ hbasisdef ] h_1=(h_1^+,h_1 ^ 0)v_^*_a , h_2=(h_2^+,h_2 ^ 0 ) _ v_b_a .",
    "this basis choice is known as the higgs basis . in this basis , the 2hdm scalar potential becomes [ hbasispot ] & = & y_1 h_1^h_1 + y_2 h_2^h_2 + [ y_3 h_1^h_2+h.c . ]",
    "+ & & + z_1(h_1^h_1)^2 + z_2(h_2^h_2)^2 + z_3(h_1^h_1)(h_2^h_2 ) + z_4 ( h_1^h_2)(h_2^h_1 ) + & & + \\{z_5 ( h_1^h_2)^2 + h_1^h_2+h.c.}. from the scalar potential in one can extract the squared - mass matrix for the three neutral states , [ matrix33 ] = v^2 (    ccc z_1 & re(z_6 ) & -im(z_6 ) + re(z_6 ) & + y_2/v^2 & - im(z_5 ) + -im(z_6 ) & - im(z_5 ) & + y_2/v^2    ) .",
    "the field @xmath13 and the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 depend on the choice of basis , and thus are not physically meaningful by themselves unless a symmetry ( such as susy ) is selecting a preferred basis .",
    "thus , the mass matrix in is not invariant .",
    "this matrix is diagonalized with the transformation [ rmrt ] r r^t=_d  ( m_1 ^ 2,m_2 ^ 2,m_3 ^ 2 ) , with @xmath16 defined as follows : [ rmatrix ] r = r_12r_13r_23 & = & (    ccc c_12 & -s_12&0 + s_12 & c_12&0 + 0 & 0&1    ) (    ccc c_13&0 & -s_13 + 0 & 1&0 + s_13&0 & c_13    ) (    ccc 1&0 & 0 + 0&c_23 & -s_23 + 0&s_23 & c_23    ) + & = & (    ccc c_13c_12&-c_23s_12-c_12s_13s_23&-c_12c_23s_13 + s_12s_23 + c_13s_12&c_12c_23-s_12s_13s_23 & -c_23s_12s_13-c_12s_23 + s_13&c_13s_23&c_13c_23    ) , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the angles @xmath19 and @xmath20 are invariant ; the third angle @xmath21 depends on the basis choice . however , the product @xmath22 is invariant .",
    "thus , one can express the squared - mass matrix entirely in terms of invariants : [ mtilmatrix ] r_23r_23^t= v^2 (    ccc z_1 & re(z_6 e^-i_23 ) & -im(z_6 e^-i_23 ) + re(z_6",
    "e^-i_23 ) & re(z_5 e^-2i_23)+ a^2/v^2 & - im(z_5 e^-2i_23 ) + -im(z_6",
    "e^-i_23 ) & - im(z_5 e^-2i_23 ) & a^2/v^2    ) , where @xmath23 is defined by [ madef ] a^2y_2+v^2 . in this paper",
    "we use a mass ordering of the neutral fields such that @xmath24 .",
    "the remaining higgs particle has the mass = [ mch ] .    in calculating the oblique parameters ,",
    "certain invariant combinations of the mixing angles appear .",
    "these combinations are presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    ".the u(2)-invariant quantities @xmath25 are functions of the the neutral higgs mixing angles @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath26 and @xmath18.[tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the differences between the cp - violating and cp - conserving results were in all cases much smaller than the width of the distributions , confirming that the numerical findings in this paper apply to the cp - conserving 2hdm as well .",
    "unfortunately , this result precludes the possibility of predicting from experimental values of the oblique parameters whether the 2hdm would have cp - violation in the scalar sector .",
    "this numerical analysis of the cp - violating 2hdm shows that the model generically predicts large scalar masses , with average masses in the 400 - 600 gev range .",
    "it is unsurprising , then , that a random sampling of the parameter space produces values of the extended oblique parameters w , v , and x that are at least an order of magnitude smaller than those of the traditional oblique parameters s , t , and u , since the extended oblique parameters are expected to be small except where the mass scale of the new physics is very close to the z boson mass .",
    "larger values of w , v , and x are consistent with the 2hdm , but are not characteristic of the model .",
    "we also find that the 2hdm produces values of u within .01 of zero , suggesting that the behavior of s and t is best compared to the experimental values where u has been fixed to be zero .",
    "the @xmath27 parameter , for which the 2hdm produces a wide range of values , puts constraints on the possible values of the charged higgs mass and even more so on the splitting between the heaviest neutral scalar mass and the charged higgs mass .",
    "the 2hdm favors large @xmath28 values , of at least 250 gev , and even larger values of @xmath29 , the heaviest neutral higgs boson .",
    "in particular , we find @xmath30 gev .",
    "this suggests that if a light scalar particle ( say @xmath4 gev ) is discovered at the lhc , the possibility remains of heavier scalars being found closer to the tev scale , with the charged higgs particle expected to be lower in mass than the heaviest neutral state .",
    "these numerical results are not significantly affected by altering the definitions used for the oblique parameters , nor by going to the cp - conserving limit .",
