    "<S> we study the natural excitation of molecular systems , applicable to , for example , photosynthetic light - harvesting complexes , by natural incoherent light . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with the conventional classical models , we show that the light need not have random character to properly represent the resultant linear excitation . </S>",
    "<S> rather , thermal excitation can be interpreted as a collection of individual events resulting from the system s interaction with individual , deterministic pulsed realizations that constitute the field . </S>",
    "<S> the derived expressions for the individual field realizations and excitation events allow for a wave function formalism , and therefore constitute a useful calculational tool to study dynamics following thermal - light excitation . </S>",
    "<S> further , they provide a route to the experimental determination of natural incoherent excitation using pulsed laser techniques .    </S>",
    "<S> the process of light - matter interaction can initiate fundamental dynamics in systems as diverse as semiconductors , quantum dots , and living organisms . of particular interest </S>",
    "<S> is the linear interaction of sunlight with molecules such as photosynthetic light - harvesting complexes @xcite , which is the foremost step responsible for primary energy production on earth .    </S>",
    "<S> while the development of advanced experiments such as non - linear spectroscopy @xcite allows characterization of the system s dynamical properties upon photo - excitation , the measured molecular dynamics can differ from that resulting from natural excitation conditions @xcite , mainly because of significant differences between the exciting lights @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although in theory , it is possible to measure molecular dynamics directly from incoherent excitation @xcite , technical difficulties are such that , in practice , no experimental data are yet available . at present , the dynamics of a system excited by thermal light can only be inferred from appropriate theoretical models , which require a proper description of thermal excitation . </S>",
    "<S> two different approaches are available : ( i ) a full quantum - mechanical treatment , using a quantum description of the light ( well - known for thermal light , e.g. the @xmath0-representation , representing the light state by direct products of incoherent mixtures of coherent states associated with a single frequency  typically plane waves @xcite ) , or ( ii ) a semi - classical approach  based on a classical description of the radiation field .    </S>",
    "<S> thermal light can only be represented statistically by a probability distribution function or , alternatively , as a set of all possible realizations . </S>",
    "<S> the most conventional classical representation  collision - broadening model @xcite  relies on realizations with stochastic phase jumps to reproduce the random character of thermal light , with the average time interval between jumps reproducing the ( short ) coherence time . here we show that no random parameter is needed for the proper representation of _ linear _ excitation , i.e. weak excitation , and that , in first - order perturbation theory , an ensemble of _ deterministic _ realizations can reproduce the result of thermal - light excitation . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , even pulses are possible . in studying the interaction of a molecule with an ensemble of fields ( representing the individual realizations ) </S>",
    "<S> , we provide answers to the following question : what field characteristics provide a proper description such that the ensemble of individual realizations yield the correct molecular density matrix ?    </S>",
    "<S> we address this question within the framework of a molecule , applicable to , e.g. , photosynthetic pigment - protein complexes such as the fenna - matthew - olson ( fmo ) complex @xcite , or the lh2 light - harvesting complex @xcite . because we focus on the molecular response to the light , the relevance and interpretation of our results are independent of the effects of the protein environment , and we assume a closed molecular system .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the hamiltonian @xmath1 where the system hamiltonian ( first term on the r.h.s . ) </S>",
    "<S> is written in the basis of eigenstates @xmath2 with eigenenergies @xmath3 , and the second term describes the interaction with the field in the semi - classical approach . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the molecular ground state , is the transition dipole moment operator , oriented along the unit vector @xmath6 ; @xmath7 denotes the positive frequency part of one individual field realization . </S>",
    "<S> the superscript @xmath8 is used throughout the paper to label a particular realization , either of the field , or of the corresponding molecular excited state . </S>",
    "<S> this hamiltonian characterizes the molecular dynamics upon interaction with one of the field realizations .    in the rotating wave approximation and in the limit of weak - field interaction </S>",
    "<S> , first - order perturbation theory provides a solution for the wave function resulting from the @xmath5 state excitation as a superposition of eigenstates : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of molecular eigenstates and @xmath11 denotes the eigenfrequencies . here , we assume the excited - state level splitting to be larger than their spontaneous decay widths and neglect effects from radiative decay @xcite . for the sake of clarity </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a one - dimensional field , and assume it lies along the orientation of the transition dipole moment @xmath6 , taken identical for all eigenstates .    </S>",
    "<S> considering that the molecule s response to a stochastic field is composed by an ensemble of individual excitation events , we define the density matrix : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes averaging over the ensemble of realizations . from ( [ </S>",
    "<S> eq : psi_alpha_def ] ) , the elements of this density matrix are : @xmath14 with @xmath15 .    now we require that this density matrix be representative of thermal - light excitation , and obtain the restrictions on the fields @xmath16 and ensemble @xmath13 . for the molecule considered in ( [ eq : h ] ) , interaction with thermal light would lead to the excited state described by the density matrix @xmath17 with elements : @xmath18 where the first - order correlation function between the @xmath19 and @xmath20 cartesian components of the field , for thermal light , is @xcite : @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the average photon number at temperature @xmath23 and @xmath24 the boltzmann s constant .    requiring that ( [ eq : rho_tot ] ) </S>",
    "<S> describes the same molecular dynamics as that after thermal - light excitation implies a matching of first - order correlation functions according to : @xmath25    to calculate the ensemble - averaged auto - correlation function of the field , we use the fourier representation for the individual realizations : @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the fourier components . </S>",
    "<S> we choose all individual fields with identical spectral distribution @xmath28 and only allow differences in the phase factor . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier coefficients can therefore be written as the product of a real function @xmath29 defining the spectral distribution ( independent of @xmath8 ) and a phase factor @xmath30 ( dependent on @xmath8 ) : @xmath31 the field auto - correlation function averaged over the ensemble of realizations then becomes : @xmath32 we choose the phase factor with a linear dependence on frequency , and interpret the ensemble averaging as a continuous sum over the phases , i.e.    [ eq : phase ] @xmath33    so that the last line in ( [ eq : g1_def ] ) yields a delta function and reduces the two frequency integrals to a single one . asking that ( [ eq : g1_def ] ) matches the thermal - light first - order correlation function ( [ eq : g1_th ] ) restricts the lineshape @xmath29 so that the electric field for each individual realization ( [ eq : e_ind_def ] ) becomes : @xmath34    using this field as the individual field realizations , the individual excitation events ( [ eq : psi_alpha_def ] ) become @xmath35 where the complex constant @xmath36 and coefficients @xmath37 are detailed in the supplementary information ( si ) . </S>",
    "<S> the state @xmath38 represents a contribution to the total density matrix following excitation from one single realization of the field . the total density matrix ( [ eq : rho_tot_def ] ) is then obtained by averaging over the ensemble according to our definition ( [ eq : avg_def ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to analytically show that , with our definition of the field realizations ( [ eq : e_ind ] ) and using ( [ eq : avg_def ] ) , the density matrix ( [ eq : rho_tot_def ] ) built from the ensemble of individual excitation events recovers that obtained directly from thermal light excitation ( [ eq : rho_known ] ) , i.e. @xmath39 specifically , ( [ eq : rho_tot ] ) becomes @xmath40 sample responses are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : rho_tot ] ) , showing the perfect match and equivalence between methods . as in @xcite , where the incoherent radiation is modeled as white - noise </S>",
    "<S> , we find that sudden turn - on incoherent excitation can still lead to coherent excitation , with the amplitude of the coherence inversely proportional to the energy splitting between eigenstates . in our approach , </S>",
    "<S> the coherence survives destructive interference between the individual excitation events with primary contribution from realizations with @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> although non - zero , the coherences are of constant amplitude and quickly , i.e. after a few femtoseconds , become negligible compared to linearly growing populations .     and ( b ) coherence @xmath42 : the total response , calculated from the sum over the single excitation events ( [ eq : rho_tot_sol])@xmath43 lines , matches the response to thermal - light excitation ( [ eq : rho_known])@xmath44 dots . note the different scales and amplitudes of coherence _ vs. _ population . </S>",
    "<S> parameters used are representative of a photosynthetic light - harvesting complex : @xmath45  ev , @xmath46  ev , @xmath47  e. . </S>",
    "<S> convergence of @xmath43 is obtained using @xmath48 realizations , where @xmath49 is the time in femtoseconds . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rho_tot ] ]    _ interpretations _  by construction , the spectral density of each field realization ( [ eq : e_ind ] ) is identical to that of planck s radiation law because of the matched correlation functions ( [ eq : match_g1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> . hence the field realizations s coherence time matches that of thermal light ( about 1.3 fs)since , we recall , the coherence time is defined as the inverse of the spectral density fwhm and therefore independent of the phase factor , _ cf . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : e_omega ] ) . as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : e_ind ] ) , the linear dependence of the phase on frequency ( [ eq : phase_def ] ) localizes the individual realizations , forming pulses . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the @xmath50 phase factor acts such that the field realizations only differ from one another by a time translation  also evident from the time representation in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : e_ind ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the averaging process over all realizations ( [ eq : avg_def ] ) becomes equivalent to averaging over all times , what recovers the classical time average .    ) representing a sample of field realizations  for @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> all fields have the same spectral distribution and coherence time , matching that of blackbody radiation . the linear phase ( [ eq : phase_def ] ) results in localized pulses , with a duration of @xmath525  fs , and acts such that the field realizations only differ from one another by a translation in time . [ fig : e_ind ] ]    fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : rho_ind ] ) shows the individual excitation events ( [ eq : psi_ind ] ) corresponding to the particular field realizations sampled in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : e_ind ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> each event corresponds to a response from an impulsive driving force , i.e. with coherent evolution and constant population after excitation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the field realizations are all identical to within a time factor , the individual molecular responses are more complex . specifically , the field realizations differ by a phase factor , reflected in a time shift of the individual diagonal elements contributing to the total populations @xmath53 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> coherence - wise , the individual molecular contributions @xmath54 present , in addition to the time translation , variations in amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , although the individual molecular responses are not phase related ( because of different onsets ) , for sudden turn - on , the total contribution can still exhibit some non - zero oscillatory coherences surviving destructive interferences .    ): </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) population @xmath55 and ( b ) coherence @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rho_ind ] ]    _ discussion _  the pure states ( [ eq : psi_ind ] ) correspond to excitation by the field realizations ( [ eq : e_ind ] ) and it is possible to build , from these individual responses , a molecular density matrix equivalent to that resulting from thermal - light excitation . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , this would require recording the molecular response after excitation at all times and averaging over the ensemble of these individual responses .    </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that the ensemble average can be performed in many ways . </S>",
    "<S> similar results fulfilling ( [ eq : rho_equal ] ) can be obtained with individual realizations that differ from ( [ eq : e_ind])e.g . </S>",
    "<S> non - pulsed light could be used instead . more generally , the only requirement to achieve the thermal result is to match the thermal - light first - order correlation function , which requires : ( i ) matching the spectral distribution ( and hence the coherence time ) , and ( ii ) that the ensemble of field realizations fulfills @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions will reproduce the stochastic character of the first - order correlation of thermal - light . </S>",
    "<S> the latter requirement resembles the condition that the fourier components of a stationary random process belonging to different frequencies are uncorrelated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the fourier components of the derived fields ( [ eq : e_ind ] ) are correlated at the level of the individual realizations , this correlation is lost upon averaging over an infinity of independent realizations . </S>",
    "<S> this is in accordance with the fact that , for a stationary and ergodic ensemble of random functions , one can replace the auto - correlation function defined by the time average by that defined as an ensemble average @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that this not only holds at the level of the field , but also applies to describe linear excitation of molecules .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that our results apply to _ linear _ interaction , relevant to natural incoherent light . </S>",
    "<S> in general , retrieving the state of thermal light ( i.e. its full density matrix and match all its properties ) from an ensemble of single broadband coherent states ( representative of pulses ) is not possible and already fails for the simplest second - order correlation describing broadband delayed excitation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , we emphasize that the individual realizations have no physical meaning . </S>",
    "<S> it is only the ensemble average that relates to the natural incoherent excitation process .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the implications of our results are two - fold for the modelling of linear light - matter interaction : conceptually , we showed that linear excitation by thermal light can be represented by an ensemble average of deterministic pulse realizations , with no random character  all effects of incoherence are recast in the post excitation averaging . </S>",
    "<S> practically , we provide , with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : psi_ind ] ) , an alternative description of the molecular excitation that allows one to study the dynamics of a molecule at the wave function level , which presents great simplifications over the conventional density matrix formalism . </S>",
    "<S> further , the results motivate experimental studies of natural incoherent excitation using pulsed laser techniques . as such , our findings </S>",
    "<S> are expected to facilitate the study of the molecular dynamics after thermal - light excitation , such as photosynthetic light - harvesting complexes under natural excitation conditions .    </S>",
