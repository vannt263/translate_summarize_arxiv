    "neutron transmutation doped ( ntd ) ge sensors are commonly used as low temperature sensors in the rare decay events like neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite and dark matter search  @xcite .",
    "thermal neutron capture by ge atom leads to the production of dopants  @xcite like ga , as and se .",
    "this doping method is preferred over the melt growth method due to its homogeneity  @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity of a ntd ge sensor is given by  @xcite -0.6 cm @xmath3 where the parameters @xmath4 depends on intrinsic properties of ge , t@xmath5 depends on the doping level and the constant @xmath6 is close to 0.5  @xcite .",
    "it is important to achieve a high sensitivity ( dr / dt ) keeping resistance r of the sensor within the measurable range at mk temperature .",
    "the desired neutron fluence will depend on the actual isotopic composition of the ge wafer .",
    "since the reactor neutrons are not monoenergetic , samples are exposed to neutrons having a broad range of energies ( @xmath7  0.625  ev to 10  mev ) during the irradiation . in particular , high energy neutrons can cause damage to the lattice structure of the crystal . even for thermal neutrons ,",
    "the average recoil energy ( @xmath8  182  ev ) of ge(n,@xmath9 ) reaction is sufficiently high to drive the recoiling ge atom into the interstitial position  @xcite . the dopant atom in interstitial positions can not contribute to the total number of carrier concentration  @xcite .",
    "thus , defects created during the irradiation can significantly affect the performance of the sensor at low temperature .",
    "it should be mentioned that defect formation may depend on irradiation conditions , since both the flux and energy of fast neutrons are responsible factors . the performance of ntd ge sensors over a wide range of carrier concentration 3  x  10@xmath10 to 1.8  x  10@xmath11 was studied in detail by itoh  _ et al . _",
    "generally high temperature annealing is employed to cure the crystal defects and annealing conditions need to be optimized depending on the defect type and the density .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have reported that 30  min annealing in the ar gas at 600@xmath1  c for a hole concentration of 3.5  x  10@xmath12 was sufficient to recover damages , while pasca  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have employed annealing at 400@xmath1  c for 6  hours for carrier concentration in the range of 5    6.8  x  10@xmath13 .",
    "palaio  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have also discussed effects of thermal annealing in the ar gas and have reported that annealing at higher temperatures ( 500@xmath1  c ) resulted in contamination of samples due to rapidly diffusing impurities .",
    "they further observed that the ntd ge samples left at ambient temperature for eight months after irradiation showed improvements similar to thermal annealing .",
    "this is desirable for rare decay studies as annealing can introduce trace impurities in the sensors .",
    "development of ntd ge sensors for mk thermometry in cryogenic bolometer detector tin.tin ( the india - based tin detector ) to search for neutrinoless double beta decay in @xmath14sn has been initiated  @xcite .",
    "ntd ge sensors are prepared , by neutron irradiation of device grade ge samples at dhruva reactor , bhabha atomic research centre ( barc ) , mumbai , for the first time .",
    "initial results for a ntd ge sensor performance at 100  mk have been reported in ref .",
    "a systematic study of the fast neutron induced damage in the ntd ge samples for neutron fluence in the range of 2  x  @xmath15 to 1.4  x  @xmath16 which corresponds to the carrier concentration of ( 0.5 - 3.3 )  x  10@xmath11 is presented in this paper .",
    "the neutron induced damage is investigated using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy ( pals ) and channeling in irradiated samples before and after annealing . in this paper section",
    "ii describes the experimental details , data analysis and results are presented in section iii .",
    "conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "for sensor development two sets of semiconductor grade ge samples from university wafers with @xmath17 ( 0.4  mm thick , @xmath18 , 5n purity , n - type ) and @xmath19 ( 1 mm thick , @xmath20 , 5n purity , n - type ) cleavage plane were used .",
    "the ge samples were single side mirror polished .",
    "the cleavage plane @xmath19 is preferred over the @xmath17 in terms of clean cutting of smaller sensors from the irradiated sample .",
    "actual isotopic abundances of both @xmath19 and @xmath17 samples were obtained with the secondary ion mass spectrometry ( sims )  @xcite .",
    "it was observed that @xmath21ge and @xmath22ge , which produce @xmath23ga and @xmath24as , respectively , are fractionally more in @xmath19 compared to that in @xmath17 and hence , the net carrier concentration for a given neutron flunece is expected to be similar .",
    "the production rate of dopants are estimated from the measured isotopic abundance and n - capture cross section taken from ref  @xcite .",
    "these estimated production rates per unit neutron fluence and the expected net carrier concentration values are tabulated in table  [ table5 ] .",
    "the scanning electron microscope ( sem ) and energy dispersive x - ray analysis ( edax ) studies of the ge wafer prior to irradiation showed no surface impurities other than traces of oxygen .",
    "the neutron irradiation was carried out at dhruva reactor , barc , mumbai ( india ) for samples of different sizes ( 10  x  30  mm@xmath25 or 10  x  10  mm@xmath25 ) in different batches . required neutron fluence was estimated based on measured isotopic abundances but actual neutron fluence varied depending on the reactor power .",
    "typically , samples were irradiated for 4  -  6 days and the estimated thermal as well as fast neutron fluence are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "a minimum cooldown period of 45 days was required before the irradiated samples could be handled for measurements .",
    "although the samples were cleaned with electronic grade alcohol prior to irradiation ( as described in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the irradiated samples showed lack of lustre . hence",
    ", the irradiated samples were etched with hf ( 40@xmath26 ) to clean the surface .",
    "it should be mentioned that all measurements have been carried out 4 to 8 months after the irradiation .",
    "[ table5 ]    . estimated production rate of dopants ( @xmath27 ) per neutron , obtained by multiplying measured isotopic abundance of ge  @xcite with n - capture cross section ( taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ) . net carrier concentration ( p - type ) = @xmath23ga - ( @xmath24as + 2 @xmath28 @xmath29se ) is given in the last column .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the estimated defect densities for samples b and d , where measurable change in @xmath30 was observed for unannealed samples with respect to virgin samples are tabulated in table [ table4 ] . the defect concentration from the channeling experiment",
    "is estimated to be 1.6  @xmath26 and is consistent with pals measurement  ( @xmath31  0.1  @xmath26 ) .",
    "it may be added that the estimated @xmath32 values for 50  kev and 100  kev energy window below the surface peak defined depth are similar within error , indicating no significant dechanneling effects in near surface region .",
    "the development of ntd ge sensors has been initiated for mk thermometry in tin.tin detector . ntd ge sensors are prepared , by thermal neutron irradiation of device grade ge samples at dhruva reactor , barc , mumbai , for the first time .",
    "the carrier concentration in irradiated , annealed samples was estimated from the hall effect measurement at 77  k and is found to be in good agreement with that estimated from the neutron fluence .",
    "fast neutron induced defects have been studied using pals and channeling .",
    "the pals measurements indicated monovacant type defects for all irradiated samples , whereas the channeling studies revealed no significant defects for fast neutron fluence upto @xmath33x  10@xmath34 .",
    "these fast neutron induced defects were observed in the irradiated samples even after about 4  -  8 months of irradiation .",
    "thus unlike in ref .",
    "@xcite , for neutron fluences @xmath31  10@xmath35 studied in the present work leaving the samples at ambient temperature is not sufficient .",
    "it is shown that vacuum annealing at 600  @xmath1c for @xmath2 hours is sufficient to recover the damage in the irradiated samples , as verified from both pals and channeling .",
    "the annealed samples with carrier concentration in the range @xmath36  x  10@xmath11 are found to be suitable for the sensor development .",
    "the sensor made from the annealed ntd ge sample was tested in the temperature range 75 - 250 mk and the results are reported in the ref .",
