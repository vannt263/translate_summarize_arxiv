    "it has been a long time for us to search the exotic hadrons such as the glueballs and hybrids .",
    "no candidate that has been found confirmedly so far .",
    "recently , there are some evidences for the existence of hybrids resonance however .",
    "the e852 collaboration at bnl@xcite has reported a @xmath8 isovector resonance @xmath9 in the reaction @xmath10 with the mass @xmath11 mev and width @xmath12 mev .",
    "since the normal @xmath13 meson only has even spin in the channel ( @xmath14 ) , the state @xmath1 must be beyond the quark model .",
    "the crystal barrel collaboration has also claimed to find an evidence in @xmath15 annihilation which may be an resonance with a mass of @xmath16 mev and a width of @xmath17 mev@xcite .",
    "recently , the e852 collaboration put forth evidence for another @xmath8 exotic meson @xmath18@xcite , decaying to @xmath19 , in the reaction @xmath20 , with a mass and width of @xmath21 mev and @xmath22 mev respectively .",
    "if these experiments have been confirmed in the future , they will provide a very strong evidence for the existence of the constituent gluon .",
    "theoretically , the hybrids have been studied widely by various methods such as bag model@xcite , flux - tube model@xcite , qcd sum rules@xcite , lattice @xcite and some other models@xcite . however , there are few works about the heavy - light hybrids except for qcd sum rules@xcite in which the spectrum of the heavy - light hybrid was given . compared with @xmath23 and @xmath24 hybrid ,",
    "the heavy - light hybrid is easier to be dealt with since the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) may work in such a system .",
    "as we know , hqet has led to much progress in the theoretical understanding of the properties of hadrons@xcite .",
    "in such a framework , many phenomenology methods become easier to be controlled . for instance , qcd sum rule in hqet has been applied to various calculations of physical parameters , such as the decay constants , form factors and decay widths@xcite .    in the heavy - light hybrids case , the calculation in full qcd theory in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the constituent of gluon gives a contribution more than @xmath25 to the mass , so the `` light freedom '' is too heavy and the availability of @xmath7 expansion seems problematic .",
    "let s consider this problem . in the framework of @xmath7 expansion",
    ", the mass of heavy hadron can be expressed as @xmath26    where the @xmath27 have the dimension of mass and can be estimated by the mass split of the doublet such as ( @xmath28,@xmath29),(@xmath30,@xmath31 ) because of the heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "for instance , @xmath32 gev , then @xmath33 , which is roughly equal to @xmath34 gev if we choose @xmath35 , therefore , the next - leading correction is around @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , one can obtain @xmath37 if one chooses @xmath38 , and @xmath39 for doublet ( @xmath30,@xmath31 ) . from the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mass split of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is @xmath40 for @xmath41 hybrid , so @xmath42 and the next - leading correction is around @xmath43 . for the @xmath44 hybrid , the mass split from ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath45 , @xmath46 , which deviates a little more from @xmath47(it is also a little smaller than @xmath48 gev ) , and the next - leading correction @xmath49 . comparing with b and d mesons",
    ", we can think it is still safe to use @xmath7 expansion in @xmath41 hybrid system while it should be very careful to apply hqet to @xmath44 hybrids .    as to the decay property of hybrids , the results given by the qcd sum rules @xcite gave a strong disfavor to the experiments .",
    "the decay width for some individual channel calculated by them is much lower than the reported experimental results . as we know",
    ", all the predictions in sum rules before is dependent on the three - point correlation function , so the uncontrolled ambiguity resulted from the double borel transformation will be brought in and the infrared divergence in the soft pion limit will appear too .",
    "to avoid these disadvantages , we make use of the two - point correlation function between the pion and vacuum in our derivation instead of the normal three - point correlation function . besides",
    ", it simplifies our calculation .    in this paper",
    ", we employ the hqet sum rules to calculate the decay width of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 hybrids to @xmath50 meson and pion .",
    "for convenience , we keep only the leading order of @xmath7 expansion in our calculation , which may make some deviation in the @xmath44 hybrid case .",
    "our numerical results show that the decay width of @xmath51 is about @xmath4 mev while the decay width of @xmath5 is only @xmath6 mev .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the analytic formalism of hqet sum rules for the decay of hybrid is given in sec .",
    "2 . in sec . 3",
    ", we calculate some pion s matrix element which is necessary in the sum rules for the calculation of decay width .",
    "the numerical results of the decay width were obtained in sec .",
    "we give the conclusion and discussion in the last section .",
    "in this paper , we consider the following processes @xmath52 where the @xmath53 represents the hybrid with @xmath41 quark and momentum @xmath54 , which has @xmath55 , @xmath56 represents the hybrid with @xmath41 quark and momentum @xmath54 , which has @xmath8 . here , the electric charges of the mesons except for pion have not been written out explicitly .",
    "the cases of @xmath57 and @xmath58 are completely analogous . to calculate the decay widths of these processes , we consider the following two - point correlator @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61",
    ", @xmath62 is the heavy quark effective field with four velocity @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are scalar functions of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are defined as @xmath68    @xmath64 and @xmath65 are determined through the spectral density saturated by the mesons corresponding to the interpolated currents , respectively .",
    "here we mention that the interpolated current for the hybrid with a fixed @xmath69 is not unique , different interpolated current corresponds to different state@xcite .    before carrying out the operator product expansion , we can simplize the correlation function eq .",
    "( [ correlation ] ) firstly .",
    "since the free heavy quark propagator in @xmath70 representation in hqet is @xmath71 and the interaction of the heavy quark with the gluon field @xmath72 in the leading order of @xmath7 expansion is @xmath73 .",
    "then in the fixed - point gauge @xmath74(which will be used throughout this paper ) , the full propagator of the heavy quark @xmath75 in the leading order of @xmath7 expansion is the same as the free one .",
    "then the correlator ( [ correlation ] ) reduces to the one including only light quarks .    performing the ope in @xmath76 , we get @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in deriving the last equation in ( [ cor ] ) , the quark field @xmath80",
    "is expanded around zero and only the first two terms are kept , the numerical results in section .",
    "4 assure it a good expansion .",
    "we stress here that , since the perturbative theory does not break chiral symmetry @xmath81 , there is no perturbative contribution to the sum rules in ( [ cor ] ) in the chiral limit .",
    "the two matrix elements in ( [ cor ] ) will be obtained through another suitable sum rules with the method used in ref .",
    "their detailed expressions will be given in the next section .",
    "on the other side , @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be represented with the spectral density through the dispersion relations . because the perturbative contribution vanish",
    ", we suppose that the contribution of continuum states vanishes too .    from the definition of eq .",
    "( [ var ] ) , we have @xmath82 and one has to make the double borel transformation on the two variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the soft pion approximation was used in the spectral density in ref .",
    "@xcite , which deduced functions of single variable .",
    "however , in the case of heavy - light hybrid s decay , the soft pion approximation is not good since the pion momentum may be large .",
    "here we make a more reasonable approximation @xmath83 in the infinite heavy quark mass limit , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "( [ app ] ) can be obtained from @xmath86 as @xmath87 .",
    "we find that the difference between @xmath66 and @xmath67 is around @xmath88 gev in the case of heavy - light hybrid .",
    "with the single pole terms and double pole term included in the spectral density , then @xmath64 and @xmath65 are expressed as functions of the single variable @xmath67 , respectively @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the mass of the hybrid , meson , and heavy quark , respectively . @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the above equations are constants .",
    "@xmath95 are decay constants and @xmath96 refers to decay amplitudes . for convenience ,",
    "they are defined in full qcd theory as below @xmath97    therefore , only one variable borel transformation is needed .",
    "taking the borel transformation @xmath98 on both sides of the sum rules and differentiate the results in the variable @xmath99 , we get the expression for the decay amplitudes @xmath100e^{2\\lambda'/\\tau},\\\\ g_{h^-m\\pi } = { m^3_q\\over f_{h^-}f_mm^4_{h^-}m^2_m}[2\\lambda ' b'(\\tau)+b_0]e^{2\\lambda'/\\tau}\\label{am2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the borel transformed function of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "their expressions are obtained @xmath105+[(m_h - m_m)f_1/4+f_3/16]{1\\over\\tau}\\},\\\\ b'(\\tau)&=&4\\sqrt{2}[2(m_h - m_m)d_2+f_1/(12\\tau)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath106,\\\\ b_0&=&{\\sqrt{2}f_1 \\over 3 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath107,@xmath108 and @xmath109 will be given in the next section .",
    "once the decay amplitudes are determined , it s straightforward to obtain the decay widths of the processes ( [ processa ] ) and ( [ processb ] ) .",
    "the key to the sum rules is the determination of the two pion s matrix elements in ( [ cor ] ) .",
    "the first pion s matrix element @xmath110 has already been given in ref .",

    "we can obtain the following equations about @xmath95 @xmath114 and @xmath115 vanishes .",
    "where @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 are some constants defined as @xmath119    in order to get the numerical results of the constants @xmath109 , we take advantage of some other suitable sum rules , through which the constants @xmath109 can be obtained by the following correlation functions , respectively @xmath120 where the @xmath121 or @xmath122 refer to the u , d quark or antiquark corresponding to which in the @xmath123 .    keeping the matrix elements of ope up to dimension six and omiting the radiative correction , we obtain the borel transformed functions @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the borel transform parameter of the sum rules .    to obtain the numerical results ,",
    "the constants and condensates are chosen as @xmath126 and where the @xmath127 .",

    ". 2 , where one can find stable platforms in the region @xmath128 gev .",
    "they read @xmath129",
    "before going on the numerical calculation of the decay width , there are still some parameters necessary to be fixed .",
    "the heavy quark and meson masses are given as those in ref .",
    "@xcite and the decay constants of b and d mesons are chosen as ref .",
    "the masses of the heavy - light hybrids have been computed in ref.@xcite in the full qcd theory though the b quark mass(@xmath130 gev ) and some other parameters were chosen unsuitablely , we just recite the results of their calculation in this paper .",
    "the decay constants of hybrids had nt been determined in ref .",
    "@xcite yet , so we fix them through the parameters and formulae given in it as @xmath131 where @xmath132 refer to the functions corresponding to the @xmath55 and @xmath8 states @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the mass of the hybrids , the borel parameter @xmath125 is chosen in the region where both the masses and the decay constants have platform and the scale of the @xmath135 is set at the borel variable .",
    "their results are given in the table 1 too .",
    "with the help of eq .",
    "( [ am1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ am2 ] ) , the numerical results of the decay amplitudes are shown as fig . 3 and fig .",
    "the platform is not good , we choose the value around the region @xmath136 gev , which is the suitable region in sum rules analysis , as our results .",
    "the numerical result shows that the next - leading contribution is less than @xmath137 of the leading term at this region , so the ope is well performed .",
    "all the parameters and some results calculated are collected in table .",
    "1 .    .[tab1 ] _ parameters input and the decay amplitudes . _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    as to the processes ( [ processa ] ) and ( [ processb ] ) we considered , with the help of the formulae for two body decay , the decay widths in the leading order of @xmath7 expansion are given as @xmath138    when all the numerical results are put in , the decay width corresponding to processes ( [ processa ] ) and ( [ processb ] ) are obtained @xmath139    as we know , the decay of hybrids appears to follow the almost universal selection rule that gluonic excitations can not transfer angular momentum to the final states as relative angular momentum , that is to say , the decay of hybrids to @xmath140 final pairs of mesons are preferred , while the decay of hybrids to two s - wave mesons are suppressed @xcite .",
    "but the selection rule is not absolute , in the flux tube and constituent glue models , it can be broken by wave function and relativistic effects , and the bag model predict that it is also possible that the excited quark loses its angular momentum to orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "though the results obtained here are much larger than those calculated for the similar decay modes in the light hybrids case @xcite , which depended on the construction of three point correlation function , these results could nt be excluded by theory .",
    "the reason that the decay widths of the @xmath1 hybrids are much smaller than those of the @xmath0 hybrids results from the additional factor @xmath141 in the width formulae([de ] ) compared with that of the @xmath0 s , since in the decay channel @xmath142 , the final states are in a relative p - wave .",
    "in this paper , we discuss the decay of the heavy - light hybrids @xmath143 and @xmath144 to @xmath145 by qcd sum rule approach in the framework of heqt . with the help of the spectrum of the heavy - light hybrids@xcite , we argue , in the @xmath41 hybrid case , convergence of @xmath7 expansion is similar as that in the @xmath30 meson case , while it is not so good for the @xmath44 hybrid .",
    "the two - point correlation function instead of the normal three - point correlation function is employed for the derivation , and the heavy quark freedom is extracted out of the correlation functions in the @xmath70 representation , which leads to the estimate of some pion s matrix elements and facilitates the calculation . in the leading order of @xmath7 expansion ,",
    "the process of the calculation becomes much easier .    to find the hybrids ,",
    "one approach is to look for an excess of observed state over the number predicted by the quark model , the other is to search for quantum numbers which can not be accommodated in the quark model , so the experiments place main efforts on the exotic mesons searching and the current experiments concern mainly the light hybrids sector , however , it s necessary to extend the search to the heavy - light hybrids sector .",
    "the calculation shows that the decay width of @xmath146 is around @xmath4 mev , while the decay width @xmath147 is only @xmath6 mev .",
    "if people think the total width of hybrid is around 200 mev , the channel @xmath148 may not be dominant in hybrid s decay , for instance , the channels @xmath149 may be larger because of qcd anomaly .",
    "the calculation of these and other channels is beyond this paper .",
    "there are some uncertainties unavoidable in this paper , which result from such as pole approximation , @xmath7 expansion(we keep only the leading order term ) and ope(we keep only the first two terms of ope in ( [ cor ] ) ) , omitting the higher orders would give some uncertainties .",
    "besides , the calculation is dependent on the numerical results of the masses and decay constants of the hybrids taken from the ref .",
    "@xcite , which were determined by some unpopular parameters . to follow the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite with the new values of the parameters is beyond the goal of this paper .",
    "certainly , it s necessary to identify the spectrum and decay width of heavy - light hybrids through other models and other sum rules , for example , light cone sum rules .",
    "only when most of the models give detailed research on hybrids , can we declaim that we have a good understanding about the hybrids .",
