    "the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) , which is a phase transition driven purely by quantum fluctuations and which occurs at zero temperature , is believed to be an important concept in condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "it is defined as the nonanalytic behavior of the ground - state properties , and thus reflects quantum fluctuations , which differentiates it from the temperature - driven thermal phase transition that reflects thermal fluctuations .",
    "most qpts can be described within the traditional symmetry - breaking formalism ; however , there are also exceptions which can only be characterized by topological order@xcite . in these topological quantum phase transitions ( tqpts ) ,",
    "the local perturbation effects may be exponentially suppressed , as was observed in fractional quantum hall phases@xcite .",
    "this qpt has appeared in a number of unrealistic models and is also related to many realistic systems such as high temperature superconductors@xcite . despite many theoretical examples that show the existence of the qpt , there is still no definite way to mark it in terms of a local - order parameter .",
    "recently , much attention@xcite has been drawn to the use of fidelity to mark the qpt ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for example",
    ", the fidelity approach to the tpqt occurring in the kitaev toric model have been used in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the fidelity between two states in the kitaev honeycomb model@xcite has been studied in refs .",
    "e. eriksson and h. johannesson proposed that several tqpts were accurately signaled by a singularity in the second - order derivative of the reduced fidelity@xcite .",
    "fidelity is suggested to be particularly suited for revealing a qpt in the bose - hubbard model@xcite .",
    "moreover , the ground - state fidelity and various correlations to gauge the competition between different orders in strong correlated system were also discussed@xcite .",
    "fidelity is a concept borrowed from quantum - information theory and is defined as a measure of similarity between two quantum states .",
    "intuitively , it would be a good marker , since the structure of the ground state should suffer a dramatic change through the phase transition point . as fidelity is purely a quantum - information concept ,",
    "the advantage of using fidelity is that no @xmath0 @xmath1 knowledge of any order parameter and changes of symmetry of the system need to be assumed .",
    "this idea has been used to analyze the qpt , and its validity has been confirmed in many systems@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the role of the leading term of fidelity was explored pzanardi0701061,wlyou07 .",
    "the fidelity susceptibility , which is the second derivative of the fidelity with respect to the driving parameter , was introduced to study the qpt@xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that the fidelity susceptibility is actually equivalent to the structure factor ( fluctuation ) of the driving term in the hamiltonian on the perturbation level . in this case , if the temperature is chosen as the driving parameter of thermal phase transitions , the fidelity susceptibility , which is extracted from the mixed - state fidelity between two thermal states@xcite , is simply the specific heat .",
    "from this point of view , using the fidelity to deal with the qpt seems still to be within the framework of the correlation function approach , which is intrinsically related to the local order parameter .",
    "except for the global fidelity , which measures the difference between ground states differing slightly in the driving parameter , the reduced fidelity , which describes the difference of the mix - state of only a local region of the system of interest , was also introduced .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the reduced fidelity should be useful in many ordinary symmetry - breaking qpts as well as some tqpts@xcite .",
    "the reduced fidelity reveals information about a change in the inner structure for a system undergoes a qpt , and it is significant to investigate the behavior of the reduced fidelity susceptibility in both critical and noncritical regions .",
    "recently , it was shown that the tqpt in the kitaev spin model can be characterized by nonlocal - string order parameters@xcite , so it would be interesting to see whether it is able to mark this tqpt with a local quantity ; namely , the reduced fidelity .    in this work",
    ", we study the reduced fidelity and reduced fidelity susceptibility in the kitaev honeycomb model . because of its potential application in topological quantum computation",
    ", such a model has been the focus of research in recent years , despite its being rather artificial@xcite .",
    "we show that the reduced fidelity susceptibility of two nearest sites manifest itself as a peak at the qpt point , although the one - site reduced fidelity susceptibility vanishes .",
    "our results directly reveal that the reduced fidelity susceptibility can be used to characterize the qpt in the kitaev honeycomb model , and thus suggest that the reduced fidelity susceptibility is an accurate marker of the tqpt when it is properly chosen , despite its local nature .",
    "this article is organized as follows . the model and the calculation of reduced fidelity are presented in sec .",
    "the results of the reduced fidelity and fidelity susceptibility are discussed in sec .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "the kitaev honeycomb model was first introduced by kitaev to study the topological order and anyonic statistics , which describe a honeycomb lattice system with a spin 1/2 located at each site .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of an anisotropic nearest - site interaction with three types of bonds : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "the model hamiltonian is @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the two ends of the corresponding bond , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are dimensionless coupling constants and pauli matrices respectively .",
    "bellow , we solve this model within the method developed by kitaev@xcite . here",
    ", we would like to mention that z. nussinov and g. ortiz have also illustrated how kitaev s honeycomb model may be solved directly@xcite . within this approach ,",
    "the above hamiltonian can be rewritten using fermionic operators as @xmath10with @xmath11 the momenta take the values @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an odd integer ; then the system size is @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , we have the ground state @xmath15with the ground - state energy @xmath16the two - site reduced density matrix can be expressed as @xcite @xmath17where @xmath18@xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 are pauli matrices @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 for @xmath25 @xmath19@xmath26@xmath21@xmath27 to 3 , and the unit matrix for @xmath25 @xmath19@xmath28@xmath21@xmath29",
    ".    now we consider the nearest - two - site reduced density matrix , ( i.e. , the reduced density matrix of an @xmath30-bond .",

    "now we calculate the reduced fidelity susceptibility @xmath48 . for diagonal density matrices ,",
    "the fidelity susceptibility is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the driving parameter .    with this expression , we first set @xmath51 and select @xmath52 as the driving parameter , and then we have @xmath53and @xmath54 \\notag \\\\ \\partial _ { j_{z}}c_{y}&=&\\frac{1}{l^{2}}\\sum_{\\mathbf{q}}\\frac{1}{e_{\\mathbf{q}}^{2 } }   \\notag \\\\ & & \\lbrack ( e_{\\mathbf{q}}\\epsilon _ { \\mathbf{q}}^{\\prime } -e_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\prime } \\epsilon _ { \\mathbf{q}})\\cos q_{y}+(e_{\\mathbf{q}}\\delta _ { \\mathbf{q}}^{\\prime } -e_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\prime } \\delta _ { \\mathbf{q}})\\sin q_{y } ] \\notag \\\\ \\partial _ { j_{z}}c_{z}&=&\\frac{1}{l^{2}}\\sum_{\\mathbf{q}}\\frac{e_{\\mathbf{q}}\\epsilon _ { \\mathbf{q}}^{\\prime } -e_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\prime } \\epsilon _ { \\mathbf{q}}}{e_{\\mathbf{q}}^{2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    also , we can set @xmath55 and make @xmath2 the driving parameter , and the formula can be achieved in a similar way .",
    "then , we can study the reduced fidelity and reduced fidelity susceptibility depending on which parameters we are interested in .",

    ", this plane is divided into a gapped phase and a gapless phase .",
    "these two phases are separated by the triangle line connecting the @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 points .",

    "it is quite clear that the two - site reduced fidelity can serve as a signature for the tqpt in the kitaev honeycomb model .     along the dashed line shown in the triangle for the @xmath30 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 bonds.,width=283 ]    in order to illustrate the ability of reduced fidelity to mark the tqpt in kitaev honeycomb model , we calculate the reduced fidelity susceptibility and present the results of the reduced fidelity susceptibility for a system size @xmath13=3001 and for different bonds along @xmath62 and @xmath55 in fig .",
