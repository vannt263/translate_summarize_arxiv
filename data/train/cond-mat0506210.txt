    "we consider delta interacting bose gas in a 1d box .",
    "its experimental realization is possible due to recent experimental progress in trapping of small samples of ultracold bosonic atoms in a box - like optical trap @xcite .",
    "another exciting experimental setup may come from a paper of gupta _ et al _ @xcite , where successful realization of a ring shaped magnetic trap filled with a bec was recently reported .",
    "the hamiltonian of our system in dimensionless quantities ( see appendix [ a2 ] for units ) reads : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the interaction coupling @xcite .",
    "it turns out that there is only one parameter that determines system static properties : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is atomic density normalized to @xmath4 . in the limit of @xmath5",
    "our system is a bose - einstein condensate , while when @xmath6 it is a tonks gas , whose properties are captured by the fermi - bose mapping theorem ( fbmt ) @xcite . to see how big is a bec - tonks crossover",
    "one can look at sound velocity and compare it to bec and tonks predictions .",
    "exact expression for sound velocity @xcite ( see also appendix [ a2 ] ) is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is defined by lieb and liniger in @xcite . the @xmath9 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  notice how slowly the system enters a tonks regime .",
    "a large bec - tonks crossover , @xmath10 , provides us motivation for studies of shock waves outside bec @xcite and tonks @xcite limits .",
    "many - body solutions of ( [ manybody ] ) at zero absolute temperature have been analyzed in classic papers @xcite .",
    "these solutions are based on the bethe ansatz and allow for analytical extraction of different static system properties .",
    "unfortunately , they are too complicated for description of system dynamics .    to simplify the problem a proper hydrodynamical approach",
    "can be worked out @xcite and leads to the following set of equations @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is an external potential acting on atoms .",
    "a nice property of these equations is that they exactly reproduce sound velocity ( [ exact ] ) , while the problems with their usage for description of shock propagation ( not formation ) come from their derivation valid in the long - wavelength limit , where the quantum pressure ( qp ) term , @xmath15 is negligible .    to get more insight into physics described by ( [ euler ] ) and validity of a qp term we look at bec and tonks limits . in the bec case , @xmath16 and eqs .",
    "( [ cont],[euler ] ) can be obtained by time - dependent variational principle applied to a product wave function @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "it results in time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ gp ] )",
    ". then substitution of @xmath19 and @xmath20 into ( [ gp ] ) gives a bec version of ( [ cont],[euler ] ) .",
    "in other terms , @xmath3 in ( [ cont],[euler ] ) is a single particle density defined in a many - body theory as @xmath21 which equals @xmath22 in the bec limit . a quantum pressure term in this limit",
    "is rigorously derived @xcite .    in the tonks regime one",
    "has @xmath23 , which was first found by renormalization group approach in @xcite , and then used in a number of papers , e.g. , @xcite",
    ". now derivation of ( [ euler ] ) , do not involve any sort of product simplification ( [ spwf ] ) of a wave - function .",
    "indeed , a fermi - bose mapping theorem @xcite implies , e.g. , that if @xmath24 is a ground state wave - function of noninteracting fermions placed in the same potential as a tonks gas , then a ground state tonks wave - function is @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , even a simple description of a tonks gas based on the single particle density ( [ spd ] ) involves @xmath26 orthogonal single particle orbitals instead of a single one , @xmath27 , used in the bec case .    in tonks",
    "limit the qp term was shown to lead to unphysical density oscillations @xcite . from knowledge that the quantum pressure term is present in the bec limit @xmath5 and absent in tonks regime @xmath6 it is clear that eqs .",
    "( [ cont],[euler ] ) can not describe shock propagation for arbitrary @xmath28 .",
    "nonetheless , shock formation from density perturbations that are initially wide can be successfully done , and will be described below . in this case",
    "the qp term is unimportant roughly up to shock formation .",
    "due to lack of theoretical concepts for getting exact time - dependent solutions for the system of interest , we consider future experimental results as the best verification of our calculations based on hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the quantum pressure term ( [ qpressure ] ) is important only when density changes occur on length scales smaller then the characteristic length given by @xmath29 in a bec limit @xmath30 is called a healing length , and we propose to use the same name regardless of @xmath28 .",
    "now we want to solve eqs .",
    "( [ cont],[euler],[muuu ] ) . assuming that the perturbation under consideration is , at least initially , broad compared to @xmath31 , the quantum pressure term in ( [ euler ] ) can be neglected . following standard methods @xcite one",
    "gets @xmath32 @xmath33    to proceed further with analytical calculations we use the following relations : @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 from the requirement that both expansions match at @xmath37 . expression ( [ bec ] ) is extracted from lieb s observation @xcite that for @xmath38 @xmath39 since ( [ obs ] ) complicates further calculations , we expanded it into a series around @xmath40 equal to zero . expression ( [ tonks ] ) is taken directly from lieb and liniger paper @xcite  see eqs .",
    "( 3.32 ) and appendix [ a2 ] .    to test above approximations we compare the shock wave solutions that neglect the qp term and use approximate expression for @xmath41 , to the full numerical solution of hydrodynamic equations ( [ cont],[euler],[muuu ] ) .",
    "initially we determine velocity field from ( [ velocity ] ) and choose @xmath42 with @xmath43 ( calculations for @xmath44 can be easily repeated ) .",
    "the background density @xmath45 is found from the normalization condition : @xmath46 , where we have assumed that periodic box has boundaries at @xmath47 . for well localized perturbations being of interest from now on one gets @xmath48 . finally , it is convenient to define relative density @xmath49 now we consider separately @xmath50 and @xmath51 cases .",

    "first of all , impulse amplitude , @xmath59 , is constant in time .",
    "second , speed of impulse maximum for any @xmath60 equals @xmath61 and applicability of this expression is not limited to @xmath62 perturbations only  sec . [ sec4 ] .",
    "third , the width of the impulse at given density is constant during propagation- a property that we missed in earlier papers @xcite .",
    "fourth , impulse tails propagate roughly with the background sound velocity equal to @xmath63 , while the impulse maximum moves with the speed @xmath64 . since @xmath65 monotonically increases with @xmath66 ,",
    "the impulse deforms its shape so that a shock wave front forms , i. e. , @xmath67 at one point .",
    "time and position of shock - wave creation can be extracted from equations @xcite : @xmath68 their solution gives : density @xmath69 at which density profile becomes locally vertical , and time @xmath70 at which this occurs : @xmath71 @xmath72 these expressions close to a tonks gas limit take a simple form : @xmath73    comparison of analytical solution ( [ hypimpl ] ) and full numerical one based on hydrodynamic equations ( [ cont],[euler],[muuu ] ) is presented in fig .",
    "as easily seen , there is a good agreement between hydrodynamical solution and a shock - wave one until the moment of shock creation .",
    "then discrepancy increases due to appearance of density oscillations triggered by the qp term ( [ qpressure ] ) neglected in derivation of ( [ hypimpl ] ) .",
    "since presence of the qp term for large @xmath28 , e.g. , @xmath52 , is questionable , it is an interesting open question whether density oscillations in the form presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] survive or not for any @xmath52 considered here .",
    "the healing length reads @xmath74 derived by extraction of @xmath75 from ( [ obs ] ) and subsequent taylor expansion of ( [ healing ] ) .",
    "naturally , the first term in ( [ healing_bec ] ) corresponds to the bec healing length .",
    "the implicit shock - wave solution has the form : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the background speed of sound in the limit of @xmath5 .",
    "combining ( [ nonlin ] ) and ( [ bec ] ) one gets @xmath78 to verify accuracy of ( [ i ] ) we have simulated dynamics for the system with @xmath79 , i. e. , for @xmath80 outside the bec mean - field regime ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , but small enough to stay clearly within @xmath51 parameter range .",
    "agreement between full numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( [ cont],[euler ] ) and implicit shock solution is good before shock formation .",
    "close to time of shock creation discrepancies show up in the oscillatory region missed in ( [ i ] ) .",
    "qualitatively , the plot that presents these results is the same as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "since dynamics of initial density profile is qualitatively the same as in the @xmath52 case , we notice that impulse maximum moves now for any @xmath60 with velocity @xmath81    the explicit solution of shock equations ( [ shock ] ) can be found in the limit of @xmath82 , but still arbitrary @xmath60 : @xmath83 @xmath84 interestingly , for a gaussian like initial impulse discussed in @xcite explicit expressions for @xmath69 and @xmath70 in this limit were beyond the reach . finally , we note that the qp term for @xmath5 is certainly present , but it is hard to say whether it survives in ( [ euler ] ) for any @xmath51 . since the qp term affects shock dynamics strongly , an experiment should clarify this uncertainty .",
    "in this section we describe some general properties of shock - wave solutions ( [ nonlin],[velocity ] ) . to this aim",
    "we consider density profiles satisfying @xmath85 suppose that there are @xmath86 extrema ( minima , maxima ) , placed on a background density @xmath45 , in the initial density profile @xmath87 .",
    "let us denote positions of these extrema at @xmath88 as @xmath89 and set @xmath90 .",
    "it means that @xmath91 and @xmath92 . at @xmath93",
    "one gets from ( [ impl ] ) @xmath94 which obviously equals zero iff @xmath95 .",
    "it implies that @xmath96 .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath97 , which proves that extrema do not change into saddle points in the course of time evolution .",
    "this means that velocity of impulse extrema equals @xmath98 , where @xmath99 .",
    "since @xmath100 is shape independent , we conclude that for any @xmath28 density extrema propagate with constant amplitude and speed equal to @xmath98 .",
    "this speed is well approximated as @xmath101 @xmath102 for @xmath28 s a little off @xmath37 .    finally , it is important to stress that above statements concerning the amplitude and velocity of density extrema are valid at least as long as the implicit solution works , i. e. , up to the time of shock creation .",
    "after that time , they are valid in regions far enough from shock structures .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , experimental creation of matter - wave packets undergoing shock - wave dynamics is straightforward .",
    "the idea is to cool atoms in an additional external potential created by a well - detuned laser beam , and then suddenly turn the beam off .",
    "the term suddenly , means on time scale much smaller than time of sound propagation through the perturbation .",
    "the initial density of atoms resulting from an external laser potential @xmath14 is determined as follows . combining density @xmath3 and velocity field @xmath20 into @xmath19 the eqs .",
    "( [ cont],[euler ] ) can be rewritten to the standard form @xmath103 which time - independent version reads @xmath104 with @xmath105 being a chemical potential .",
    "assuming that the laser potential induces density changes on length scales larger than the healing length ( [ healing ] ) , one determines an initial density profile from @xmath106 with @xmath105 found from @xmath107 .",
    "naturally , velocity field equals zero in an initial state considered here .",
    "a straightforward generalization of results from @xcite shows that if the initial density profile is @xmath108 with @xmath109 then @xmath110 , with @xmath111 being background sound velocity ( [ exact ] ) .",
    "therefore , there are left and right moving perturbations .",
    "due to mirror symmetry , we can forget about the left moving one once the pulses are well separated .",
    "the right - moving pulse is described by @xmath112 as long as @xmath113 , since even arbitrarily small density perturbations experience a shock deformation after long enough evolution .    in bec and",
    "tonks limits qualitatively the same splitting process takes place even when @xmath114 @xcite . when the initial density profile is @xmath108 , the right moving pulse is described by @xmath115 with @xmath100 being the same as in ( [ impl ] ) and @xmath116 .",
    "we checked by solving hydrodynamic equations ( [ cont],[euler ] ) that above described splitting process works qualitatively the same way for any @xmath28 , as it works for @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "this observation explains how we imagine practical generation of matter - wave pulses described in previous sections .",
    "in the bec limit system dynamics in the mean - field approximation ( [ spwf ] ) is described by the following version of eq .",
    "( [ gp_general ] ) @xmath118 where @xmath18 .",
    "this is the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , which can be rigorously derived by different means ",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .    to go beyond the mean - field approximation we employ a second quantization formalism , i. e. , we transform hamiltonian ( [ manybody ] ) with an additional potential term , @xmath119 , into the form @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a field operator . in the number conserving bogolubov approach @xcite it reads @xmath122 with @xmath123 annihilating a particle from a condensate , and @xmath124 annihilating a particle from modes orthogonal to the condensate one . naturally , @xmath125 is a condensate mode , i. e. , it is an eigenstate of a single particle density matrix , @xmath126 , to the highest eigenvalue ( @xmath127 ) : @xmath128 the single particle density of atoms , @xmath129 , equals @xmath130 and @xmath131 , e. g. , for finite temperature calculations .",
    "indeed , density of atoms at sufficiently low temperature @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) equals @xcite @xmath134 where @xmath135^{-1}$ ] . to get @xmath136 , @xmath131 and @xmath137 one",
    "first finds a condensate mode from the time - independent gp equation , @xmath138 , and then constructs the matrix @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a projector to space orthogonal to a condensate mode : @xmath141 .",
    "the modes and frequencies are found from the eigen equation @xmath142 while their dynamics is captured by @xmath143 where @xmath105 is set to zero in @xmath144 , and the calculation of operator @xmath144 at every time step requires simultaneous solution of the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "expressions for densities of atoms ( [ ddensity0 ] ) and ( [ ddensityt ] ) are unchanged in a time dependent case . for a list of @xmath145 ,",
    "@xmath146 modes properties , and details of the number - conserving bogolubov approach see @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize what are limitations of the bogolubov approach . to simplify notation we discuss @xmath147 case now ( the results for @xmath148 can be easily obtained ) .",
    "the bogolubov method fails in the following two situations .",
    "first , the global breakdown , shows up when total number of depleted atoms , i. e. , @xmath149 , becomes comparable to number of atoms in the system .",
    "this limitation comes directly from derivation of bogolubov hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "second , local breakdown , happens when density of depleted atoms becomes comparable to condensate density on a length scale of the order of the healing length : @xmath150 with @xmath151 . to clarify ( [ instability ] ) , we notice that in the bogolubov approach an impact of noncondensed atoms on condensed ones is neglected . indeed ,",
    "to get bogolubov dynamics one solves a time - dependent gp equation and then puts this solution into equations of motion of noncondensed atoms . in this way",
    "noncondensed particles are influenced by condensed ones but not other way round .",
    "next order corrections take into account change of condensate density as a result of repulsive interactions between condensed and noncondensed clouds , and lead to modifications of the gp equation .",
    "the correction to the right hand side of ( [ gp ] ) is qualitatively of the form @xmath152 ( eqs .",
    "( 95,96 ) in @xcite ) , where @xmath153 so that @xmath154 can be regarded as an external potential acting on a condensate .",
    "extension of changes of condensate density induced by an external , localized potential , is given by the healing length @xcite .",
    "therefore , impact of depleted atoms on a condensate is best given by comparison of the new term , @xmath155 averaged over a few healing lengths , to previously dominating term in the gp equation , @xmath156 , averaged on the same set of points .",
    "it gives the condition ( [ instability ] ) .",
    "appearance of such a local breakdown of bogolubov approach will be shown after breaking of a dark shock density profile resulting in soliton production .",
    "finally , let us comment when condensate depletion might affect mean - field predictions .",
    "since density of depleted atoms depends on the product of @xmath157 and @xmath26 only , it is unaffected by the limit @xmath158 while the condensed part in total atomic density grows as @xmath159 ( [ ddensity0],[ddensityt ] ) .",
    "it means that in this limit , being to some extent possible with the help of feshbach resonances @xcite , density of depleted atoms does not affect density measurements .",
    "the exception might happen when there is dynamical instability leading to fast increase of depleted fraction . then sooner or later density of depleted atoms will start to have an important impact on condensate dynamics .    in a generic experimental situation , however , a fraction of depleted atoms is non - negligible . to compare a mean - field prediction to quantum many - body dynamics ,",
    "we have chosen a particular set of experimentally accessible parameters  see appendix [ a1 ] for details .    in the following we discuss evolution of shock structures resulting from white ( @xmath60 ) and dark ( @xmath44 ) initial density profiles , where @xmath160 stands for relative perturbation amplitude : as in eq .",
    "( [ hyperbolicus ] ) .",
    "since corrections to mean field equations are very different in these two cases we discuss them separately .",
    "+    * white shock waves : * we have done different calculations changing not only the size of an initial perturbation but also @xmath161 , @xmath26 , etc . in all cases we observe that total depletion of a condensate negligibly increases from beginning of time evolution to appearance of well developed shock structures .",
    "density of depleted atoms around shocks becomes at most @xmath162 larger than depletion density far away from perturbations .",
    "therefore , if density and distribution of depleted atoms was such that the bogolubov approach was initially applicable , it will also work during shock creation and propagation .",
    "the results for experimentally relevant choice of parameters are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . as easily seen from differences in scales between figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , ( c ) and figs .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , ( d ) , the corrections to the mean - field result are minor . repulsion between condensed and depleted atoms , results in localization of depleted atoms around condensate density minima : fig .",
    "[ fig3](e ) .",
    "this was predicted by us in @xcite , however , the amount of depleted atoms , turns out to be insufficient to fill condensate ripples .",
    "we have also done finite temperature calculations according to ( [ ddensityt ] ) . at @xmath148 not only quantum depletion but also thermal",
    "one shows up , which leads to increase of total number of depleted atoms in comparison to the @xmath147 situation .",
    "we have considered low temperatures , i. e. , @xmath163nk ( see appendix [ a1 ] ) , to see whether thermal effects qualitatively affect shock dynamics .",
    "the only difference with respect to @xmath147 case is that total depletion is larger by a factor of @xmath164 for @xmath165nk , which is still not enough for getting significant corrections to bec shocks from depleted atoms .",
    "these calculations suggest that the gross - pitaevskii equation captures correctly physics of white shock waves in a bec .",
    "finite temperature effects does not seem to destroy the qualitative picture of shock formation and propagation given by the mean - field approach .",
    "* dark shock waves : * dark density profiles undergo two distinct stages of evolution . in the first one ,",
    "shock waves form , while in the second one shock density profile breaks into a train of solitons that move , according to the mean - field approach , with constant velocity and without changes of shape .",
    "the same was independently observed numerically in @xcite and theoretically in @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions in both papers are based solely on the basis of mean - field equations .",
    "as in white shocks calculations , we have fixed the parameters to those experimentally relevant see appendix [ a1 ] .",
    "the formation of shock wave structures is depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) .",
    "now a rear impulse edge self - steepens instead of a front one .",
    "this comes from the fact that now impulse tail moves faster than impulse center , i. e. , density minimum . in the case considered in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , a shock profile breaks before complete separation . obviously , if the impulse would be more shallow the breakdown would happen later .",
    "as easily seen , the correction to total density coming from depleted atoms can be neglected at this stage of time evolution .",
    "after shock breakdown , solitons are produced as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig4](e )",
    ". then density of depleted atoms increases by orders of magnitude .",
    "it results in significant corrections to total density of atoms and causes local , i. e. , around soliton minima , breakdown of the bogolubov approach according to ( [ instability ] ) .",
    "notice that still fraction of depleted atoms , less than @xmath166 in fig .",
    "[ fig4](f ) , is so small that the global condition of bogolubov approach applicability is well satisfied . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] both peak density of depleted atoms at soliton minimum ( dots ) and total depletion of a condensate ( squares ) follow approximately power law increase from the moment of soliton train formation .",
    "it is easy to predict qualitatively what are corrections to a bogolubov result coming from depleted atoms .",
    "the next order corrections to the bogolubov approach come from inclusion of repulsive interactions between condensed and non - condensed atoms .",
    "it is qualitatively accounted for by introducing a new potential term , eq .",
    "( [ vdepl ] ) , into the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "it means that soliton structures in condensate density will become wider , so that depleted atoms will have more space to distribute themselves inside solitons .",
    "therefore , increase of peak density of depleted atoms will certainly slow down .",
    "this observation is supported by nonperturbative calculation of dziarmaga @xcite , who found that total density of atoms at soliton minimum approaches background density for large times .",
    "+    such a fast increase in density of depleted atoms around soliton minima is rather a generic phenomenon .",
    "indeed , it was first theoretically discussed for phase - imprinted solitons in harmonic traps @xcite as a mechanism for fast disappearance of solitons in the hannover experiment @xcite .",
    "the experimental time scale for soliton disappearance was found both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite to be @xmath167 .",
    "our calculation , based on the same value of nonlinear parameter @xmath168 , gives the same estimation for instant when corrections to dynamics of dark - shock - originated solitons become important .",
    "indeed , the time instant @xmath169 in fig . [ fig4](e ) , corresponds to @xmath170ms see appendix [ a1 ] for a unit of time .    to end this section",
    "we recall that predictions presented here apply to a 1d bec system .",
    "there was recently an attempt to experimentally verify applicability of the mean - field approach to shock phenomena @xcite .",
    "the conclusion was that the ripples in a white shock wave front are not filled with depleted atoms .",
    "our present work supports this observation assuming that 1d results are qualitatively correct in 2d rapidly rotating array of vortices on top of which a white shock wave front propagates .",
    "this paper presents a complete hydrodynamical description of basic properties of shock - waves in a delta interacting 1d bose gas .",
    "our predictions can be directly verified experimentally . in principle",
    ", a proper experimental setup should answer at what lieb - liniger parameter @xmath28 the quantum pressure term starts to lead to unphysical results .",
    "notice that density oscillations in front of a shock wave are present due to this term for small enough @xmath28 , while for large @xmath28 they are absent in exact solution and shocks propagate in a very different way @xcite .",
    "in fact , a change of this kind in shock dynamics can be a nice experimental signature of a bec - tonks crossover .",
    "we also discussed quantum many - body corrections to gross - pitaevskii shock - wave solutions .",
    "this way we clarified the role of depleted atoms in shock dynamics .",
    "this important point was missed in previous studies of bec shock waves @xcite .    from experimental point of view",
    ", tools for verification of our predictions seem to be available either right now or in the nearest future .",
    "indeed , a first experiment on sound propagation in a bec was done years ago @xcite . since we do not discuss time - of - flight measurements",
    "the best comparison between our theory and experiment should rely on _ in situ _",
    "measurements @xcite . the most prospective experimental setup for observation of shock dynamics in different @xmath28 parameter ranges",
    "is probably provided by a box - like optical trap @xcite , where values of @xmath171 approaching the bec - tonks crossover ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , have been already achieved .",
    "other interesting experimental setups include atom chips @xcite and circular atom waveguides @xcite .",
    "the latter one , being best suited for studies of shock collisions .    from theoretical side , there are at least two possible interesting extensions of this work .",
    "first of all , one can analyze shock dynamics in quasi-1d trapping geometries , where the system is a 3d waveguide with adjustable harmonic transverse confinement .",
    "this can be easily done using results from @xcite . indeed , instead of eq .",
    "( [ muuu ] ) one can consider eq .",
    "( 5 ) of @xcite and repeat subsequent calculations . in the limit of tight transversal confinement , i. e. , for a 1d bose gas , both expressions for @xmath75 lead to physically identical results .",
    "the second interesting extension of this work includes studies of possible outcomes of a single shot density measurement .",
    "in fact , it should be stressed that predictions based on hydrodynamical and bogolubov approaches apply to averages over different experimental measurements done on the system prepared many times in the same quantum state .",
    "needless to say , averages may differ from a single shot outcomes  see @xcite for an illustrative example .",

    "the eigen equation of a 1d hamiltonian expressed in terms of dimensional quantities denoted by primes is @xmath172 to get dimensionless hamiltonian ( [ manybody ] ) one introduces : @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is an arbitrary length scale .",

    "first , we rescale all quantities using the harmonic oscillator units in the @xmath190 direction . denoting by symbols without primes dimensionless quantities , @xmath191 we arrive at the following 3d gp equation @xmath192 where @xmath193 is trap aspect ratio @xmath194 while @xmath195 .",
