    "quasars and microquasars - their galactic analogs - are relativistic jet sources thought to be powered by super - massive and stellar - mass black holes , respectively ( see mirabel & rodrguez @xcite for a review ) . although the radio emission of microquasars tends to show a greater variety of behaviours , during some activity periods their radio variability pattern resembles that of quasars , but on much shorter timescales ( hours or days instead of years ) .",
    "it is now rather well established for quasars that outbursts identified in their radio lightcurves are related to moving structures in the jet imaged with radio interferometric techniques .",
    "there is also growing evidence that these structures emitting synchrotron radiation are propagating shock waves along the jet flow rather than discrete ejected plasma clouds ( kaiser  @xcite ; trler  @xcite ) .",
    "based on these facts , a natural step forward is to confront theoretical predictions of shock wave models with the observed evolution of the outbursts .",
    "the approach we developed since several years is to try to fit a series of self - similar model outbursts to the multi - wavelength monitoring observations of some of the best studied objects . until now",
    ", we studied data sets of four objects : the quasar 3c  273 ( trler  @xcite ; @xcite ) , the blazar 3c  279 ( lindfors  @xcite ) and the microquasars grs  1915 + 105 ( trler  @xcite ) and cyg  x-3 ( lindfors  in prep . ) . in this short contribution",
    ", we try to compare and discuss the jet properties derived for these four sources as one of the first attempts to sketch out a more global picture of black hole jets across the range of mass .",
    "a description of the data sets and the method can be found in our previous publications listed above .",
    "we just recall here that for 3c  279 and 3c  273 we use data spanning one and two decades , respectively , whereas for grs 1915 + 105 we use the data of 15 may 1997 in the plateau / state c / class @xmath0 state ( mirabel & rodrguez @xcite ) and for cyg  x-3 the outbursts of feb.mar .",
    "1994 ( fender  @xcite ) .",
    "the main change with respect to previous studies is that we use here consistently for all sources the modification proposed by bjrnsson & aslaksen ( @xcite ) for the initial compton stage of the marscher & gear ( @xcite ) shock model in the case of only first - order compton cooling .",
    "this flattens the initial rise of the spectral turnover with decreasing frequency , as shown schematically in fig .  1 .",
    "in the case of 3c  273 the jet parameters are such that this modification made the compton stage completely flat or even inverted ( decreasing turnover flux with time ) , which would make the model incompatible with infrared data .",
    "this problem could however be solved by assuming that the shocked material is viewed sideways ( marscher  @xcite ) .",
    "such an assumption is not unreasonable in sources with highly superluminal jets , as the jet angle @xmath1 to the line of sight for this to happen is defined by @xmath2 , which is the same condition that maximizes the apparent transverse velocity @xmath3 for a given bulk velocity @xmath4 .",
    "we therefore use here a sideways orientation of the jet for both extra - galactic sources and a face - on orientation for both microquasars .",
    ".physical jet properties of the four objects derived for the average model outburst at the time when it reaches a maximum flux ( i.e. around the transition to the final decay stage ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath5 @xmath6 from paltani & trler ( @xcite ) and with @xmath3=10 & @xmath1=10@xmath7 ( savolainen  @xcite ) + @xmath8 @xmath6 from wang  ( @xcite ) and with @xmath3=10 ( jorstad  @xcite ) & @xmath1=5@xmath7 ( see text ) + @xmath9 @xmath6 from stark & saia ( @xcite ) and @xmath10=0.81 , @xmath1=14@xmath7 & @xmath11=10kpc ( mioduszewski  @xcite ) + @xmath12 @xmath6 from greiner  ( @xcite ) and @xmath10=0.6 , @xmath1=61@xmath7 & @xmath11=9kpc ( trler  @xcite ) + @xmath13 alternative with @xmath10=0.9 , @xmath1=55@xmath7 & @xmath11=7kpc ( uncertainty on @xmath11 , see fender  @xcite ) +    due to lack of space we can not present here the derived evolution of the average outburst in the four sources .",
    "the main differences we obtain with the changes to the model described above , is that in general we do not obtain an almost flat synchrotron stage , but one with a much steeper increase of flux with turnover frequency , which becomes more difficult to distinguish from the now shallower compton stage .",
    "there is therefore some uncertainty whether the synchrotron stage exists at all or whether there is a direct transition from the compton to the adiabatic stage .",
    "another interesting point is that for the initial phases of the outburst evolution we suspect the spectral turnover @xmath14 not to be due to synchrotron self - absorption as assumed , but to a low energy cut - off of the electron energy distribution .",
    "evidence for this is the shallow spectral slope we find below the turnover frequency and which we describe in our modelling by an inhomogeneous synchrotron source .",
    "however , one would rather expect the source to become more inhomogeneous with time as the source increases in size , whereas we observe the opposite behaviour .",
    "an alternative explanation is that this flatter spectral index mimics the characteristic @xmath15 slope expected when self - absorption becomes important at a lower frequency than the synchrotron frequency associated to the electrons with minimal energy ( see e.g. the spectral shape in the upper panel of fig .  1 of granot & sari @xcite ) .",
    "this interpretation could also explain the too rapid evolution of the turnover frequency with time that we observe in both galactic sources .",
    "currently , this is described in our modelling by a non - conical jet with an opening angle increasing with time , but the physical justification for such a trumpet - like shape is not clear .",
    "more quantitatively , we made a first attempt to derive the physical properties of the jets , which we summarize in table  1 .",
    "these values have been derived for the particular point when the synchrotron spectrum of the average outburst reaches its maximum flux , which happens here for all sources at the transition to the final adiabatic cooling phase .",
    "a critical parameter is the angular size @xmath16 of the source of synchrotron emission , which we assume to be equal to the width of the jet . by assuming a same jet opening half - angle of 2@xmath7 for all sources",
    ", @xmath16 can thus be calculated from the length along the jet @xmath17 traveled by the shock during the observed time interval @xmath18 needed for the outburst to reach a maximal flux .",
    "this length itself depends on good estimates of the object s distance @xmath11 , the jet angle @xmath1 to the line of sight , and the apparent @xmath19 or real @xmath4 jet speed .",
    "we can then simply use eqs .",
    "( 3 ) to ( 5 ) of marscher ( @xcite ) to calculate the magnetic field strength @xmath20 , the normalization @xmath21 of the electron energy distribution @xmath22 and the energy density @xmath23 of relativistic electrons . for the latter we use a ratio @xmath24 of 10@xmath12 between the highest @xmath25 and the lowest @xmath26 frequency considered for integration .",
    "although these formula apply strictly to a homogeneous and spherical synchrotron source , we do not expect the emitting material in the jet to depart a lot from this ideal case at the start of the final decay stage .",
    "finally , we calculate the energy density of the magnetic field @xmath27 and the ratio @xmath28 , which is extremely sensitive to the source size as : @xmath29 .",
    "it is thus quite surprising to get values close to equipartition ( i.e. @xmath30 ) for all objects when assuming a same jet opening half - angle of 2@xmath7 and realistic values for the jet orientation and speed as given in the footnotes of table  1 .",
    "for grs  1915 + 105 there is an important uncertainty on the distance @xmath11 and jet velocity @xmath10 ( fender  @xcite ) and actually we find that higher jet speeds and smaller distances favor equipartition . for 3c  279",
    "we note that taking a viewing angle @xmath1 of 1@xmath7 ( jorstad  @xcite ) instead of 5@xmath7 results in extreme values of @xmath31 g and @xmath32erg@xmath33 leading to a ratio @xmath28 of @xmath34 , which seems very unrealistic .",
    "the observed properties of synchrotron outbursts in microquasars appears to be quite similar , at least during some period of activity , with the behaviour of quasars .",
    "we find that timescales and physical sizes of the jet do scale with the black hole mass , but not strictly linearly as expected ( e.g. mirabel & rodrguez @xcite ) .",
    "for the observed timescales we find very roughly a square root dependence @xmath35 , becoming more linear for the intrinsic lengthscale @xmath17 of the jet , which is corrected for orientation and relativistic effects .",
    "appart from this scaling the physical properties of the jets , like the magnetic field and the electron energy density , are found to be very similar in all sources except grs  1915 + 105 , which has significantly higher values .",
    "the only clear difference we find between galactic and extra - galactic jets is a harder electron energy distribution in microquasars , with an index @xmath36 being clearly below 2 in cyg  x-3 and grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "our method of fitting multi - wavelength lightcurves with model outbursts is getting to the point where we can test different models and constrain the physics of relativistic jets .",
    "there are indications that the standard shock model of marscher & gear ( @xcite ) has to be modified to describe the observed evolution of synchrotron outbursts .",
    "apart from the modifications proposed by bjrnsson & aslaksen ( @xcite ) , we find evidence that the spectral turnover might rather be due to a low energy cut - off of the electron energy distribution than to synchrotron self - absorption during the initial phases of the outburst ."
