    "in the paper @xcite was shown that a relativistic gas under the influence of a magnetic field @xmath1 of order of the quantum electrodynamics limit of @xmath2 gauss and for densities @xmath3 @xmath4 becomes unstable and collapses , since the pressure perpendicular to the field vanishes .",
    "physically , the system , infinitely degenerate with regard to the orbit s center quantum number , becomes otherwise one dimensional , with all the electrons falling on the landau ground state @xmath5 . the magnetic  bohr radius \" being of order @xmath6 .",
    "its spectrum looks equivalent to that of a free unidimensional particle moving along the external field . under these conditions the system is unable to exert any transverse pressure .",
    "looking at the problem from another side , in a recent paper @xcite has been shown that an electron gas confined to the landau ground state can not be in @xmath7-decay equilibrium in a neutron star due to an incompatibility among the spin orientation of the particles involved .",
    "the suggestion is given in @xcite that a bosonization of the electron gas may take place , which would mean a solution to the above - mentioned problem .",
    "we will discuss here the behavior of the bosonic gas whose constituent particles are relativistic bosons , which we suggest may represent the electron pairs , under such extreme conditions of confinement to the @xmath5 landau ground state . as is known in normal superconductors ,",
    "scalar pairing condensates occur in absence of a magnetic field ( cooper pairs ) .",
    "the pairing leading to bosonization is mediated by some interaction as is the coulomb exchange interaction among electrons , for instance , in the ferromagnetic pairing in atoms .",
    "in addition to bosonization , another effect could be associated with a small change in the new particle mass , that is , the final particle would have a mass smaller than twice that of the initial unpaired particles since the whole relativistic energy is reduced due to inertial effects . in view of this , we shall assume that this binding energy is not significant .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied , the superconductivity ( condensate ) is distroyed at some critical magnetic field , ( the schafroth critical field ) .",
    "but if the magnetic field increases largely enough to have a significant fraction of its density in the landau ground state , it has been suggested that the condensate reappears as a consequence of some interaction compatible with a spin - one vector pairing @xcite .",
    "this would lead to a superconductive - ferromagnetic behavior .",
    "such particles would carry twice the charge of the electron and an effective mass which in principle we take of order twice of that of the electron ,",
    "although some corrections must be introduced however , due to effects coming from the large density and the magnetic field . then the system may be treated by following the same formalism used in previous references @xcite . as a consequence of condensation",
    "the system would behave as ferromagnetic and under the action of an external field @xmath8 , a magnetization @xmath9 arises , leading us to define a microscopic magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "the interesting point here is that , due to the positive character of @xmath9 it may occur that @xmath11 , or @xmath12 i.e. , the microscopic magnetic field be produced by self - magnetization .",
    "we shall propose that the relativistic paired electron system behaves as a vector particle with energy eigenvalues @xcite @xmath13 , for the landau ground state @xmath5 ( where we take @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the electron mass ) , and @xmath16 for the excited states @xmath17 we observe that the magnetic field introduces an effective mass for vector bosons @xmath18 in the ground state such that as @xmath1 increases , @xmath19 decreases .",
    "this leads to an effective magnetic moment in the ground state @xmath20 .",
    "the magnetic mass is @xmath21 for the excited states , which increases with @xmath1 and @xmath22 .    in ref.@xcite",
    "we have shown that bose - einstein condensation , in the sense of a large population in the landau ground state having its momentum along the magnetic field equal to zero or very small , occurs for scalar and vector particles in presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "we name @xmath23^{-1}$ ] the density of particles and antiparticles , respectively , in the ground state .",
    "we expect then most of the population of particles to be around the ground state , since for small temperatures @xmath24 is vanishing small and @xmath25 is a bell - shaped curve with its maximum at @xmath26 .",
    "we will define @xmath27 and recall the procedure followed in @xcite .",
    "we call @xmath28 some characteristic momentum . taking by symmetry the density of particles minus antiparticles ( the latter will vanish as @xmath29 ) we have in a small neighborhood of @xmath26 ,    @xmath30 & & \\mbox{}\\simeq \\frac{2e b",

    "we get then    @xmath36    we observe that @xmath37 is a decreasing function of @xmath38 and vanishes for @xmath39 , where the `` critical '' condition @xmath40 is reached . as shown in @xcite in that limit the bose - einstein distribution degenerate in a dirac @xmath41-function , which means to have all the system in the ground state @xmath26 . from ( [ 5 ] ) we may write the thermodynamic potential as    @xmath42    while the magnetization is given approximately by @xmath43    @xmath44    one can then state the condition for self - magnetization by writing the equation @xmath45 . first , let us assume that @xmath46 . then @xmath47 and @xmath48  g. therefore , the condition for self - magnetization is satisfied . the system becomes a giant magnet whose stability is determined by the transverse pressure condition @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "however , the estimate value of @xmath51 would depend on the fraction of electrons paired .",
    "let us name @xmath52 , @xmath53 the density of unpaired and paired electrons , respectively .",
    "if @xmath54 . then the dominating pressure comes from the ( unpaired ) electron gas contribution , @xmath55 , which is very close to @xmath56 .",
    "thus , one can affirm that in the region @xmath57 , the condition @xmath58 holds and the bosonized ferromagnetic white dwarf star destabilizes and collapses .",
    "if @xmath59 so that te dominant pressure comes from the paired gas the collapse is also unavoidable since @xmath60 .",
    "as @xmath51 is positive , its contribution to pressure is negative .",
    "the stability requires from a fermion background .",
    "there is still another point to be considered when @xmath61 approaches to @xmath62 .",
    "as @xmath19 decreases with increasing @xmath1 , the magnetization @xmath9 increases with @xmath1 , and would diverge for @xmath63 . for @xmath64",
    "close enough to @xmath62 one expects the main contribution to @xmath1 be produced by @xmath9 .",
    "we get an equation similar to the one discussed in @xcite for the @xmath65 condensate .",
    "let us write @xmath66 where @xmath67 . for @xmath68",
    ", we have the critical field @xmath69 g. then we can write @xmath70 .",
    "we easily get @xmath71    by simple inspection we find that it has real solutions only for @xmath72 .",
    "this means that @xmath73 . by solving the cubic equation ( [ cub ] )",
    "we find that for @xmath74 these real solutions are @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the first solution means that @xmath1 increases with increasing @xmath77 , up to the value @xmath78 . in the second solution",
    "@xmath1 decreases for growing @xmath77 , and its limit for @xmath79 being @xmath80 .",
    "the last result has only meaning if interpreted as indicating that the expression for the magnetization ( [ mag ] ) is incomplete .",
    "actually , it must include the contribution from landau states other than the ground state , which lead to a diamagnetic response to the field .",
    "the decreasing in population of the ground state is compensated by the increasing of the number of particles in landau states with @xmath81 .",
    "their contribution would compensate the increasing of the self - consistent field with increasing @xmath77 to keep @xmath82 .",
    "from all the previous reasoning we conclude that an electron system , as a white dwarf , can be hardly stable at fields of order @xmath83 . in principle , such fields can be maintained self - consistently , but the possibility of a collapse is highly increased : the one - dimensional world created by the magnetic field is completely unstable .",
    "the previous results , if applied to the condensation of @xmath84 and @xmath85 mesons ( for instance , in neutron stars ) , would be compatible with the self - magnetization condition for densities of order @xmath86  @xmath4 if the resulting magnetic fields are in the interval @xmath87  g. instabilities would lead to a collapse .",
    "this point deserves further research , as it provides additional arguments to those given in @xcite against the claimed existence of the so - called magnetars , because those objects seem to be unstable under such @xmath84 and @xmath1 conditions .",
