    "controlling quantum phenomena in atomic and molecular systems is an active area of research today .",
    "persistent theoretical and experimental efforts have led to the formulation of several ingenious control schemes@xcite for both atomic and molecular systems .",
    "recently researchers have been interested in determining the  control landscape \" for specific systems @xcite .",
    "the motivation for undertaking such extensive studies is atleast twofold .",
    "firstly , several optimal control efforts@xcite seem to succeed despite employing local search algorithms in a prohibitively high dimensional control parameter space .",
    "rabitz and coworkers@xcite reason that the topology of the control landscape can shed light on the robustness of the control strategies . secondly",
    ", many control schemes@xcite involve few , carefully chosen , levels which provide valuable insights into the control process .",
    "however , such few - level schemes might be compromised due to several reasons@xcite and one hopes that identifying the features of the control landscape associated with the deviations might lead to better control techniques .    in order to set the stage for our work we briefly discuss the concept of a control landscape . consider a hamiltonian of the form @xmath0 with @xmath1 being the dipole operator and @xmath2 being the control field .",
    "there are two perspectives on the control problem which are of interest to the present work .",
    "the first one involves using a given field @xmath3 characterized by one or more control variables @xmath4 .",
    "the objective in this case is to study the variation of , say , the transition probability @xmath5 between an initial state @xmath6 and a final state @xmath7 at some target time @xmath8 .",
    "the control landscape is constructed by viewing the transition probability as a functional of the field parameters _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath9 $ ] .",
    "regions on the landscape with high values for @xmath10 yield the best possible choice of the control variables in the presupposed @xmath3 .",
    "note that it is quite possible to have several distinct choices for the control variables which yield the same value for @xmath10 .",
    "several such examples of control landscapes can be found in the literature@xcite    the second perspective on the control problem comes from the optimal control theory ( oct ) approach@xcite . in oct a cost ( landscape ) function of the form @xmath11",
    "\\equiv \\langle \\theta \\rangle$ ] , with @xmath12 being the initial density matrix and an arbitrary observable @xmath13 , is extremized with respect to the field @xmath2 .",
    "the optimal fields correspond to the solutions of the variational condition @xmath14 wherein the unitary time evolution operator @xmath15 $ ] is naturally considered as a functional of the field . the transition probability @xmath10 is a special case of @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 . again , the set of optimal fields that yield the same @xmath19 constitutes a control level set whose topology is of considerable interest since one can imagine ` morphing ' an experimentally undesirable optimal field to a more desirable field . in order to be able to carry out such a morphing it is essential to have full control of the system .",
    "assuming full controllability rabitz and coworkers have explored the topology of the oct landscapes in great detail@xcite .",
    "a particularly striking result is that the full quantum control landscape is devoid of false traps or suboptimal extrema@xcite .",
    "however , in practice one is invariably forced to impose constraints on @xmath16 in various forms .",
    "examples include specification of target time @xmath8 , minimizing the field fluence , and reduced or restricted parametrizations of the control field .    among the two perspectives on control outlined above we",
    "adopt the first one in this work _",
    "i.e. , _ the nature of the control landscape with a given form of the field .",
    "although we do not undertake an oct calculation in the present work , it is nevertheless useful to think of the field used herein as a result of a reduced dimensional parametrization of an optimal field coming out of a oct calculation .",
    "the reason being that restricted parametrizations of the optimal @xmath2 typically projects the full oct control space to a lower dimensional space which can exhibit suboptimal features@xcite .",
    "` suboptimal ' features on the control landscape are , therefore , expected in our analysis . clearly , in the oct context , suboptimal features can be avoided if the restricted parametrization is done carefully by preserving the overall intrinsic topology of the control landscape and level sets .",
    "discovering such appropriate parametrizations might not be easy but a recent combined experimental and theoretical work by roslund _",
    "_ provides a clear example@xcite . in certain instances , as in the work by bartelt _",
    "et al . _ , a systematic study of simple parametrizations of the optimal field can provide mechanistic insights into the control process@xcite .",
    "based on the discussion above , one can interpret the suboptimal features as artificial due to inappropriate field parametrization or as genuine due to the unavoidable constraints imposed on the system .",
    "consequently , the model study presented in this work incorporates two of the constraints that are expected to result in a complicated control landscape - strong fields and simple forms of the control field .",
    "it has been suggested that in strong field regimes local traps may appear more readily .",
    "however , even in the strong field regimes recent studies indicate that interpreting the various features of the constrained field control landscape is far from being straightforward@xcite . in this context",
    ", it is well known that the classical phase space of strongly driven systems exhibits widespread chaos .",
    "could it be that local traps on the strong field control landscapes arise due to the chaos ?",
    "unfortunately , not much is known about the impact of chaotic or delocalized quantum states on the topology of control landscapes and level sets .",
    "such an analysis for the full oct landscape is far from being simple .",
    "therefore , in this work we make a beginning , within the perspective discussed above , to understand the nature and origins of the suboptimal features from a classical - quantum correspondence viewpoint .    in most physical systems",
    "the phase space is mixed regular - chaotic and there is sufficient evidence in the literature to indicate that quantum states delocalized in the chaotic regions can significantly influence the control of initial states localized in the regular regions .",
    "for instance , na and reichl@xcite have shown that adiabatic passage mechanisms are modified due to the presence of chaotic states leading to chaos - assisted passage .",
    "gong and brumer@xcite have recently reviewed the subject of coherent control of quantum phenomenon in the presence of chaos .",
    "their studies , especially using the ( modified ) kicked rotor , have highlighted several intriguing features like faster - than - classical quantum anomalous diffusion and the nontrivial influence of classical phase space structures with area much smaller than the effective planck constant . as a last example we mention the work by takami and fujisaki@xcite on optimal control of random matrix systems .",
    "random matrix systems correspond to strongly chaotic classical phase space with no regular regions . in such cases it is possible , using oct , to obtain an analytic expression for the optimal field which controls the transition between two random states .",
    "the aforementioned studies , and other earlier investigations , concerned with the control of quantum processes in classically chaotic systems have raised many interesting issues .",
    "however , there are very few attempts to analyze the various features on the control landscape in terms of the phase space nature of the quantum states .",
    "controllability of quantum dynamics despite the strong chaos is surprising and calls for a careful study of the control landscape from a classical - quantum correspondence perspective .",
    "we begin in section  [ model ] with a brief description of the model system , driven double well , which has served as a paradigm for many coherent control studies .",
    "the controllability of the dynamics using a bichromatic field is studied as a function of field parameters .",
    "the role of chaotic ( delocalized ) floquet states in attempting to control the decay of an initial state localized in the regular region of the phase space is highlighted .",
    "section  [ corr ] introduces a measure which involves correlating the response of the floquet states to the control field with the overlap intensities between the initial state and the floquet states .",
    "we show that the correlator is related to generic landscape functionals and can therefore yield useful insights into the features of the control landscape from a classical - quantum correspondence point of view . in section  [ results ]",
    "we show that the proposed correlator is very sensitive to the underlying phase space structure and clearly identifies regions of no control involving delocalized ( chaotic ) floquet states .",
    "section  [ summary ] concludes with comments on the role of the chaotic states in the process of control and future studies .",
    "the model of choice to illustrate our approach is the driven double well system .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath20 with @xmath2 being the field .",
    "the driven double well model is an ideal testbed for several schemes that have been suggested for controlling coherent superposition of quantum states@xcite .",
    "apart from being used to elucidate phenomena like chaos - assisted tunneling@xcite and coherent destruction of tunneling@xcite , the model above is also relevant in research areas like quantum computing@xcite and quantum dots@xcite . in this context",
    "we also note an early study@xcite by schwieters and rabitz on the above system with the aim of designing an optimal @xmath2 to reduce the difference between quantum observables and their classical analogs . in the present work ,",
    "as alluded to in the introduction , our goal is to study control using a presupposed field and the resulting influence on the control landscape .",
    "a variety of choices can be made for @xmath2 and in this work we choose a bichromatic form @xmath21 the above choice for @xmath2 is motivated by a large number of studies@xcite that have shown the utility of such fields in controlling the dynamics with the possibility of using the relative phase @xmath22 as an extra control knob .",
    "moreover , due to the periodicity of eq .",
    "[ bichromham ] , @xmath23 , with period @xmath24 , the dynamics can be conveniently analyzed@xcite using floquet theory@xcite in terms of the floquet states @xmath25 and the associated quasienergies @xmath26 .    throughout this work @xmath27 and we fix the parameter values@xcite @xmath28 and , @xmath29 .",
    "the double well supports about eight tunneling doublets and @xmath30 nearly corresponds to the energy separation between the ground and first excited states , neglecting the tunnel splittings .",

    "the parameter values have been chosen to make contact with an earlier work by farrelly and milligan@xcite which explored the possibility of controlling the tunneling using bichromatic fields .",

    "[ fig3 ] that the landscape is highly convoluted - a consequence of the simple bichromatic choice for @xmath2 and the nonlinear nature of the classical dynamics .",

    "therefore it is reasonable to expect that the lack of control , signalled by plateaus in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a and the valleys in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , is due to the dominant participation by chaotic states _ i.e. , _ chaos - assisted tunneling@xcite .",
    "the plateaus arise due to the fact that the coupling between the localized states and the delocalized states vary very little with increasing control field strength @xmath41 - something that is evident from the floquet level motions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a and established earlier by tomsovic and ullmo in their seminal work@xcite on chaos - assisted tunneling in coupled quartic oscillators .",
    "it is important to note that for @xmath32 the chaotic states , as opposed to the regular states , do not have a definite parity .",
    "consequently , presence of the @xmath37-field does not have a major influence on the chaotic states@xcite .",
    "thus , if one or more chaotic states are already influencing the dynamics of @xmath59 at @xmath32 then the bichromatic control is expected to be difficult .",
    "similar conclusions were arrived at in a previous study@xcite involving bichromatically driven pendulum . however ,",
    "several questions , not addressed by the previous studies , arise at this juncture . what is the precise role of the chaotic states for control ? are the plateaus robust for varying @xmath41 and @xmath22 ? is there a suitable measure , generalizable to systems with higher degrees of freedom , that can identify regions on the control landscape with little or no control ?",
    "in order to address the questions raised above we first suggest a measure , different from @xmath62 or @xmath74 , to map out the control landscape .",
    "note that the floquet states and quasienergies of eq .",
    "[ bichromham ] are parametrically dependent on the field strengths _ i.e. , _ @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "thus the response of a floquet state to the @xmath37-field , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a , is measured by the parametric derivative @xmath82 which is also called as the level  velocity \" . at the same time",
    "the decay dynamics of a coherent state @xmath59 is dominated by floquet states that have appreciable overlap with @xmath59 ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ survprob ] )",
    ". therefore , floquet states @xmath83 with substantial overlap @xmath76 and finite @xmath82 are expected to be important in controlling the dynamics of @xmath59 .",
    "the qualitative argument can be made quantitative by introducing the overlap intensity - level velocity correlator @xmath84 @xmath85 was first proposed by tomsovic@xcite as a sensitive measure for deviations from ergodicity in strongly chaotic systems and has been studied in detail in subsequent works@xcite . in eq .",

[ fig5 ]",
    "we give one example of the sensitivity in the present context . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we place coherent states at different phase space points on the phase space and obtain a correlator map .",

    "we remind the reader that these parameter values correspond to the two exemplary cases denoted as ( b ) and ( c ) in fig .  [",
    "fig1](a ) .",
    "several observations can be made by inspecting the figure and we mention a few important ones .",
    "firstly , the inhomogeneous nature of the phase spaces is reflected by the correlator .",
    "specifically , the large values of @xmath90 in the regular islands on the periphery of the phase space imply participation of  fast moving \" floquet states in the dynamics . examples of such floquet states can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) as states with large level velocities .",
    "secondly , the correlator takes on different values even in the chaotic regions and therefore points to the different nature of the dynamics _",
    "i.e. , _ different groups of floquet states that influence the dynamics . finally , despite the similar looking phase spaces ,",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] that the correlator maps are different . in particular , note that the correlator values in fig .  [ fig5]a about the left and the symmetry related right regular islands have the same sign .",

    "this indicates a break in symmetry and hence provides some hints to the fact that one obtains control in this case as opposed to in case a.    before proceeding further we note that the correlator is related to the generic landscape functionals employed in oct studies@xcite . in order to see this",

    "[ intvelcor ] .",

    "[ fig4 ] at a single point on the control landscape , it is worth mentioning that the correlator identifies such regions on the landscape with remarkable ease .",

    "[ fig6]d and one observes that @xmath114 over most of the landscape which indicates very little control .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the combined driving field is symmetric about the time axis for @xmath119 .",
    "the control landscape for @xmath120 , and @xmath121 are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6]c and b respectively .",
    "note that decreasing @xmath22 from the symmetric value of @xmath122 gradually leads to regions of control .",
    "further confirmation comes from the survival probability data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for two points on each of the control landscapes with @xmath123 .",
    "it is intriguing to see that the wall of no control seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a for @xmath75 is present for all the values of @xmath22 shown here .",
    "the reasons for such robustness is not clear at the moment .",
    "note that such regions in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for @xmath123 are characterized by large negative values of @xmath113 .",
    "this seems to contradict the earlier works@xcite which associated a large value for @xmath111 with extensive localization in phase space .",
    "however , as stated earlier , in the present case the interpretations are subtle with the sign of the chaotic level - velocity playing a key role .",
    "our preliminary studies indicate that in such regions the assumption @xmath124 is weakened presumably due to an increased fraction of chaotic states .",
    "further work is needed to understand this aspect .",
    "nevertheless , the numerical results presented in fig .  [ fig6 ] indicate that regions of no control are signalled by @xmath125 whereas @xmath126 implies control .",
    "in summary , the strong field control landscapes in fig .  [ fig6 ] show that nearly perfect control is obtained as long as there is no involvement of chaotic states in the dynamics .",
    "however , involvement of the chaotic states leads to lack of control and such regions on the control landscape are interspersed among controllable regions in a complicated fashion giving rise to a highly convoluted landscape topology .",
    "some of these regions are particularly robust under field amplitude and relative phase variations ( cf .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) . given that convoluted landscapes are expected in oct studies@xcite on classically chaotic systems , it is reasonable to expect that chaotic states can be associated with certain suboptimal features on quantum control landscapes . for systems with effective @xmath127 one expects@xcite several such plateau regions and the effectiveness of the control would depend sensitively on the initial state and field parameters .",
    "we emphasize that the association of uncontrollable regions on the landscape with influence of the chaotic floquet states is made possible solely due to the highly sensitive nature of the intensity - velocity correlator @xmath113 ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ intvelcor ] ) .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath113 to the underlying phase space structures is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and makes it an ideal candidate to understand the origins of suboptimal structures on the control landscape from a classical - quantum correspondence perspective .",
    "moreover , @xmath113 can be obtained with a few floquet calculations or via the parametric equations of motion@xcite and hence applicable to multidimensional driven systems .",
    "a further attractive feature , from the point of multidimensional systems , is that the correlator is capable of establishing the influence of the chaotic states on the control landscape without the need for visualizing / classifying the states in the underlying phase space .",
    "although the present work deals explicitly with a tunneling system , many of our observations are valid in other contexts as well . in general , controlling the decay ( dissociation , ionization ) of a state is expected to be complicated if one or several chaotic states participate in the dynamics .",
    "the complications will be reflected in the form of the optimal fields .",
    "this does not contradict the recent work@xcite by takami and fujisaki since they are concerned with controlling the transition between two random states in a completely chaotic system .",
    "it is the mixed regular - chaotic phase space scenario , a generic one for molecular systems , which is expected to exhibit some of the features seen in the current study .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to see if the influence of chaotic states are indeed reflected in the topology of the quantum control level sets in an oct calculation . in this regard",
    "the present work suggests that the intensity - velocity correlator could prove to be a useful tool .",
    "we are currently exploring the usefulness of the correlator in other systems and as a tool in formulating local control strategies .",
