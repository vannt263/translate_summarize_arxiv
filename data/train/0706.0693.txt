    "<S> correspondingly , in the presence of an external magnetic field , a photon of energy @xmath7 may oscillate into an alp of small mass @xmath8 , and vice versa  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the exploitation of this mechanism is the basic idea behind alp - photon regeneration  </S>",
    "<S> sometimes also called `` light shining through a wall ''  experiments  @xcite ( cf . fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> namely , if a beam of photons is shone across a magnetic field , a fraction of these photons will turn into alps . </S>",
    "<S> this alp beam could then propagate freely through an optical barrier without being absorbed , and finally another magnetic field located on the other side of the wall could transform some of these alps into photons  apparently regenerating these photons out of nothing .    </S>",
    "<S> a pioneering experiment of this type was carried out in brookhaven by the brookhaven - fermilab - rochester - trieste ( bfrt ) collaboration , using two prototype magnets for the colliding beam accelerator  @xcite . presently , there are worldwide several second generation alp - photon regeneration experiments under construction or serious consideration ( cf . </S>",

    "<S> these efforts are partially motivated by the report from the pvlas collaboration of evidence for a non - zero apparent rotation of the polarization plane of a laser beam after passage through a magnetic field  @xcite . while the size of the observed effect greatly exceeds the expectations from quantum electrodynamics  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it is compatible with the expectations  @xcite arising in the context of a photon - alp oscillation hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the rotation observed by pvlas can be reconciled with the non - observation of a signal by bfrt , if there exists an alp with a mass @xmath9  mev and a coupling @xmath10  gev@xmath11  @xcite . although these parameter values seem to be in serious conflict with bounds coming from astrophysical considerations , there are various ways to evade them  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is extremely important to check the alp interpretation of pvlas by purely laboratory experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it would be nice if in this way one might ultimately extend the laboratory search for alps to previously unexplored parameter values ( see also ref .  </S>",

    "<S> [ regprop_short ] , this possibility enables to extend the mass region probed by the experiment , however at the expense of sensitivity : one looses about one order of magnitude in the light shining through a wall probability .    , but with reduced lengths of the magnetic field region . </S>",
    "<S> note , that the regeneration probability is reduced by a factor of @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> [ regprop_short ] ]    another idea to extend the sensitivity towards larger alp masses was introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there , it was shown that a segmentation of the magnetic field into regions of alternating polarity gives a form factor @xmath48 that peaks at a nonzero value of @xmath46 , thereby giving sensitivity to higher - mass pseudoscalars . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the conversion probability  ( [ prop_stan ] ) reads  @xcite , in a magnet with @xmath49 segments of alternating field direction ( but the same magnitude @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 \\nonumber & = & \\frac{g^2\\,b_0 ^ 2}{q^2 } \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{clc } \\sin^2\\left ( q\\ell/2 \\right ) \\tan^2\\left ( q\\ell/(2n ) \\right ) & { \\rm for } & n\\ { \\rm even } \\\\ \\cos^2\\left ( q\\ell/2 \\right ) \\tan^2\\left ( q\\ell/(2n ) \\right ) & { \\rm for } & n\\ { \\rm odd } \\end{array } \\right . </S>",

    "<S> this indeed gives rise to more sensitivity at non - zero values of @xmath46 .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we will introduce a similar , but more practical possibility based on the use of phase shift plates . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is very simple . from our starting point , </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ onedimensional ] ) , we can see that what counts is actually @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the configuration based on @xmath49 alternating magnetic fields is therefore equivalent to a configuration with non - alternating magnetic field , however with @xmath55 retardation plates with phase shift @xmath56 ( `` @xmath57 '' plates ) inverting the sign of the electric field , placed equidistantly over the length @xmath21 of the magnet . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we have alternating signs of @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the angle between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , instead of alternating signs of the magnetic field . but both cases have an identical profile of @xmath54 . in fig .  [ regprop_ret ] </S>",
    "<S> , we show that with a proper choice of the number and positions of such phase shifters , alps should easily cover the region of parameter space suggested by pvlas + bfrt + q&a . </S>",
    "<S> the same applies for osqar .    . here </S>",
    "<S> , we used one phase shift ( `` @xmath57 '' ) plate each in the middle of the generation and the regeneration sides . </S>",
    "<S> [ regprop_ret ] ]    let us now get a more intuitive understanding of how this works and see how we can do even better . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial part in eq . is the integral @xmath62    for a constant magnetic field of length @xmath21 the oscillating factor @xmath63 suppresses the integral compared to the massless case with @xmath64 , where the integral is simply @xmath65 this suppression arises because coherent production of alps works only if the alp and the photon are in phase . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath66 accounts for the phase difference between alp and photon .    </S>",
    "<S> to improve the situation one would want to bring photon and alp back into phase with each other . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved in a simple way by the introduction of phase shift plates . a simplified picture of the phase correction process is given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ illu ] . at the beginning , </S>",
    "<S> photon ( red ) and alp ( black ) are in phase . however , due to its mass , the alp has a slightly larger wavelength than the photon . </S>",
    "<S> after a few oscillations photon and alp are more and more out of phase </S>",
    "<S> . then we insert the phase shift plate ( turquoise ) . with refractive indices @xmath67 we can not make the wavelength larger . </S>",
    "<S> so it is not possible to `` delay '' the photon until the alp has caught up . </S>",
    "<S> what we can do , however , is to is to _ increase _ the phase difference between alp and photon such that it is exactly @xmath68 ( the photon does an extra wiggle in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ illu ] . ) . </S>",
    "<S> now , a phase shift of @xmath68 is exactly equivalent to a phase shift of @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> photon and alp are in phase again . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can keep photon and alp in phase over quite long distances simply by inserting a suitable phase shift plate whenever the phase difference becomes too large , and we get coherent production over the whole length of the magnet .    . </S>",
    "<S> this is corrected by introduction of a phase shift plate that causes the photon to get an extra phase @xmath70 . in other words </S>",
    "<S> the plate causes the photon to complete the extra wiggle . </S>",
    "<S> [ illu ] ]    let us now understand more quantitatively how this works . </S>",
    "<S> to derive eqs . </S>",
    "<S> and we have assumed that the photon is a plane wave . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can identify @xmath71 as the phase difference between the photon wave and the alp wave at the point @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> in general we should write ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq . ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the phases of the photon and the alp fields , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> let us imagine a situation where we insert @xmath55 thin , the mixing between photon and alp is effectively switched off compared to the mixing in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> photon and alp simply propagate through the plate without changing their amplitudes ( the phases change , of course ) . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the thickness of the plates has to be subtracted from the total length of the production or regeneration region . </S>",
    "<S> that is why we require thin plates . for practical purposes , </S>",
    "<S> this is a rather mild constraint . for @xmath75 , the thickness of the plates required for a phase shift of </S>",
    "<S> the order of @xmath68 is only @xmath76 , which is tiny compared to the typical lengths of the production / regeneration regions which are of the order of a few  m. ] , non - reflective plates that accelerate the photon phase by @xmath77 at equidistant places @xmath78 , @xmath79 , in a constant magnetic field of length @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the plates affect only the photon . </S>",
    "<S> the alp phase remains unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have , @xmath80 inserting this into eq . , we find @xmath81 we can now choose the number of plates @xmath49 and the phase shift @xmath77 according to the recipe described above . </S>",
    "<S> first we choose @xmath49 large enough such that @xmath82 and then we choose @xmath77 such that the phase difference that has accumulated over @xmath83 is `` completed '' to @xmath68 , @xmath84 evaluating eq . in the limit </S>",
    "<S> @xmath85 one finds @xmath86 and we have coherent production over the whole length @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> .    the potential of this approach is demonstrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ optim1 ] for the example of the alps experiment . in the optimized mass region </S>",
    "<S> we get more than ten times as many regenerated photons as we would get if the length of the magnet is reduced as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ regprop_short ] .    . </S>",
    "<S> in the left figure , we have used no phase correction ( red ) , one plate with @xmath87 ( green ) , and one plate with the optimal choice of @xmath77 according to eq . for @xmath88 ( blue ) . </S>",
    "<S> the black curve is for 20 plates with the optimal choice of @xmath77 . in the right figure </S>",

    "<S> an infinite number of plates this would allow to extend the mass range all the way to the frequency @xmath7 of the photons becomes imaginary . ] . in practice </S>",
    "<S> , we can insert only a finite number of phase shift plates and eq .   </S>",
    "<S> can not be fulfilled for too large masses . </S>",
    "<S> but , already a small number of plates leads to a remarkable increase of the sensitivity for higher masses , as we can see from fig . </S>",

    "<S> change the plates to a slightly different value of @xmath77 and measure again . </S>",
    "<S> this is repeated for all values of @xmath77 in the range  @xmath92 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> [ optim2 ] ]    _ in summary : _ so called `` light shining through a wall '' experiments are a promising tool to search for light particles coupled to photons . in this note we have shown how the reach of such an experiment can be extended towards larger masses by inserting properly chosen phase shift plates . although our explicit discussion is for the case of spin-0 axion - like particles the method works in general for particles exhibiting photon - particle - photon oscillations . </S>"
