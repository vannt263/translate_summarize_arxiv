    "in a recent paper @xcite , the @xmath1-distributions for the _ dimuon _ production at the lhc were calculated in the framework of the randall - sundrum - like scenario with the small curvature ( _ rssc model _",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the lhc discovery limits on 5-dimensional gravity scale @xmath4 were obtained for both 7 tev and 14 tev .",
    "in contrast to the rs1 model @xcite , in the rssc model the masses of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations @xmath9 are proportional to the curvature parameter @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 are zeros of the bessel function @xmath12 .",
    "the interaction of the gravitons with the sm fields is described by the lagrangian @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the energy - momentum tensor of the sm matter , @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the goal of this paper is to estimate gravity effects in the _ dielectron _ production , @xmath17 at lhc energies in the rssc model .",
    "the differential cross section of the process is given by @xmath18 with the transverse energy of the electron pair equals to @xmath19 . in eq .",
    "two dimensionless quantities are introduced @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the momentum fraction of the parton @xmath22 in . without cuts , integration variables in vary within the following limits",
    "@xmath23 after imposing kinematical cut on electron rapidity , the integration region becomes more complicated ( see appendix  a in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the sm contribution to the @xmath1-distribution looks like @xmath24 \\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath25 here @xmath26 , and @xmath27 with @xmath28 being third component of the quark isospin , @xmath29 being quark electric charge ( in units of @xmath30 ) .",
    "the graviton contribution comes from both quark - antiquark annihilation and gluon - gluon fusion subprocesses ( see , for instance , @xcite ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the invariant part of the partonic matrix elements , with @xmath33 being total width of the graviton with the kk number @xmath34 and mass @xmath35  @xcite : @xmath36 let us note that @xmath37 is a universal function for processes mediated by @xmath38-channel virtual gravitons .    in the rssc model ,",
    "an explicit expression for the sum ( [ kk_summation ] ) was obtained in @xcite , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the reduced 5-dimensional gravity scale , and @xmath41    let us underline that the magnitude of @xmath37 is defined by the scale @xmath42 , not by the coupling @xmath43 in the lagrangian . in general , this property is valid in the rssc model for both real and virtual production of the kk gravitons @xcite .",
    "taking into account that the transition region @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) between the ecal barrel and endcap calorimeters is usually excluded in the cms ( atlas ) experiment , we impose the cms cut on the electron pseudorapidity , @xmath47 is assumed for the dielectron events @xcite .",
    "we use the mstw nnlo parton distributions  @xcite , and convolute them with the partonic cross sections .",
    "the pdf scale is taken to be equal to the invariant mass of the electron pair , @xmath48 . in order to take into account sm higher order corrections ,",
    "the @xmath49-factor 1.5 is used for the sm background , while a conservative value of @xmath50 is taken for the signal .",
    "the differential cross section of the process under consideration has three terms @xmath51 where the last one comes from the interference between the sm and graviton interactions . since the sm amplitude is pure real ,",
    "while the real part of each graviton resonance is antisymmetric with respect to its central point , the interference term has appeared to be negligible in comparison with the pure gravity and sm terms after integration in partonic momenta .",
    "the account of the _ graviton widths _ is a crucial point for both analytical calculations and numerical estimations . as it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite , an ignorance of the graviton widths is a _ rough _ approximation , since it results in very large suppression of the cross sections .",
    "the reason lies partially in the fact that @xmath52 while in zero width approximation one gets @xmath53    let us stress that in the rssc model the gravity cross sections _ do not depend _ on the curvature @xmath0 ( up to small power corrections ) , provided @xmath54 , in contrast to the rs1 model  @xcite in which all bounds on @xmath42 depend on the ratio @xmath55 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_3_8tev ] the results of our calculations of gravity cross sections for the dielectron production at 8 tev lhc are presented .",
    "the differential cross sections for 13 tev are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_3_13tev ] .",
    "note that the gravity mediated contributions to the cross sections do not include the sm contribution ( i.e. solid lines in the figures correspond to pure gravity contributions ) .",
    "let @xmath56(@xmath57 ) be a number of signal ( background ) dielectron events with @xmath58 , @xmath59    then we define the statistical significance @xmath60 , and require a @xmath61 effect . in figure",
    "[ fig : s_7 + 8tev_5 + 20fb ] the statistical significance is shown for total number of `` events '' with @xmath62 tev and @xmath63 tev as a function of the transverse momentum cut @xmath64 and _ reduced _ 5-dimensional gravity scale @xmath42 .",
    "the integrated luminosity was taken to be 5 fb@xmath7 and 20 fb@xmath7 for @xmath62 tev and @xmath65 tev , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : s_13tev_30fb ] represents the significance @xmath66 for the dielectron events with @xmath6 tev and 30 fb@xmath7 .",
    "previously , calculations of dilepton cross sections were done in @xcite _ without _ taking into account finite widths of the kk gravitons . as was shown in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , in zero width approximation the gravity cross sections are very small in comparison with the background cross section at low and moderate values of @xmath1 .",
    "that is why , a high cut @xmath64 is needed in order to get @xmath56 comparable with @xmath57 .",
    "correspondingly , lhc search limits in @xcite are significantly smaller than in non - zero approximation for the graviton widths .",
    "in the present paper the rssc model  @xcite , @xcite is considered in which the reduced 5-dimensional planck scale @xmath42 is much larger that the curvature @xmath0 . in such a model the mass spectrum and experimental signaturesare similar to those in the add model  @xcite with one flat extra dimension .",
    "the @xmath1-distributions for the electron pairs production with high @xmath1 at the lhc are calculated for the collision energies 7 tev , 8 tev and 13 tev , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_3_8tev ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_3_13tev ] ( figures for 7 tev are not shown ) .",

    "the statistical significance as a function of the _ reduced _ 5-dimensional planck scale @xmath42 and cut on the lepton transverse momentum @xmath64 is calculated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : s_7 + 8tev_5 + 20fb ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : s_13tev_30fb ] ) .",
    "no significant deviations from the sm prediction were seen in the dielectron events at ( 7 + 8 ) tev lhc with the integrated luminosity ( 5 + 20 ) fb@xmath7 . by using our calculations , we come to the conclusion that the region @xmath67 is excluded by experimental data",
    ". we also obtain the discovery limit for the 13 tev lhc with the integrated luminosity 30 fb@xmath7 , @xmath68    let us stress that these bounds on @xmath4 do not depend on the curvature @xmath0 ( up to small power - like corrections ) , contrary to the rs1 model  @xcite in which estimated bounds on @xmath4 significantly depend on the ratio @xmath55",
