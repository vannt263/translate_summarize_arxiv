    "recently there has been a spurt in the study of multilayered heterostructures , fabricated out of strongly correlated materials . a wide range of systems have been studied experimentally and theoretically@xcite .",
    "the interface of a band insulator and a mott insulators can show metallic behavior @xcite or can even become superconducting @xcite . as shown by thiel et al .",
    ", such interfaces can be manipulated by gate voltages thereby opening the prospect for interesting novel devices .    in this letter , we investigate the interface of a metal and a system with finite onsite correlation . for onsite correlation greater than a certain value",
    "the system opens a gap , which mimics the mott insulator .",
    "what happens when we sandwich this system between two metallic planes ?",
    "we find that the overall system behaves as an insulator not only in the region where there is a gap but also in the region where the system is gapless .",
    "the introduction of metallic planes induces multiple gaps in the energy spectrum for high values of onsite correlation @xmath0 .",
    "this can be understood to be due to the emergence of vastly different types of sites both in plane and perpendicular to it .",
    "the gapless region behaves as a disordered insulator , with the disorder coming from the induced inhomogenity in the underlying coulomb landscape .",
    "there is a charge reconstruction across the planes for such a system as we vary @xmath0 . in the region of parameters where a gap opens up ,",
    "this reconstruction is more vigorous .",
    "the interface that we have studied has been studied by others@xcite using inhomogeneous dynamical mean field theory@xcite . however , in the idmft approach used above all sites in each of the planes are treated as identical(spatial variation is taken only along the z direction ) , and thus misses out on crucial in plane modulations , which is one of the crucial reasons for the opening up of multiple gaps in the spectrum .",
    "it also considers a paramagnetic solution for the magnetic sector , which is not the correct solution for an underlying cubic lattice that we study .",
    "we employ the method of unrestricted hartree fock to solve the problem .",
    "it can capture the physics arising due to spatial variations both in and perpendicular to planes .",
    "it can handle the charge and magnetic sector on the same footing and treats correlations in a self consistent fashion .",
    "recently we have shown the utility of this method in describing the metallic phase that arises in two dimensions as a result of competition between correlation and disorder@xcite .",
    "the barrier planes are described by the single orbital hubbard model and the metallic planes by the non interacting tight - binding model .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system is @xmath1\\nonumber\\\\   & -&\\mu\\sum_{i\\alpha\\sigma}c^\\dagger_{i\\alpha\\sigma}c^{}_{i\\alpha\\sigma }   + \\sum_{i\\alpha}u_\\alpha(n_{i\\alpha\\uparrow }   -\\frac{1}{2})(n_{i\\alpha\\downarrow}-\\frac{1}{2}).\\ ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the label @xmath2 indexes the planes , and the label @xmath3 indexes sites of the two - dimensional square lattice in each plane .",
    "the operator @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron of spin @xmath6 at site @xmath3 on the plane @xmath2 .",
    "we set the in - plane hopping @xmath7 to be nearest neighbor only , and equal to @xmath8 , the hopping between planes , so that the lattice structure is that of a simple cubic lattice .",
    "we take @xmath9 for the barrier planes , and zero for the metallic planes .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath10 is calculated by demanding that there be exactly n electrons in the problem .",
    "this is done by taking the average of the n/2 th and the n/2 + 1 th energy level .",
    "we make no further assumption about the magnetic regime , and thus retain all spin indices in the formulas below .",
    "we label the barrier planes with @xmath2 values from 1 to m. thus @xmath11 correspond to the metallic layers and all the other @xmath2 values correspond to the barrier planes .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig 3d we show the plot of @xmath12 and @xmath13 vs @xmath0 for @xmath14 system .",
    "we have gone from @xmath0 = 0 to @xmath0 = 10 in integral steps .",
    "it clearly shows the emergence of three grossly different types of planes as we increase @xmath0 .",
    "the three different types of planes are a ) the two metallic planes , b ) the two mott planes adjacent to the metallic planes and c ) the remaining mott plane / s .",
    "we can see that as we increase @xmath0 , more charge accumulates on the metallic planes and there is acute charge depletion from mott planes adjacent to the metallic planes .",
    "there is charge depletion from central mott plane / s also initially , but as we increase @xmath0 further , the charge at the central mott plane / planes increases slightly .",
    "this is accompanied by a large anti ferromagnetic ordering in the central planes / s .",
    "thus the charges in the central mott plane / s are unable to delocalize as it faces strong coulomb repulsion on all sides and thus it piles up .    in fig .",
    "4a we show the plots of dc conductivity against temperature @xmath15 for @xmath0 = 0,0.5,1 and 2 for a @xmath16 system , which is the largest system size that we have considered .",
    "the @xmath17 has been chosen to be twice the finite size spacing between energy levels for each of the system size that we have considered .",
    "the dc conductivity curve for @xmath18 , shows metallic behaviour as expected with a sharply falling profile with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "we note that the value of conductivity obtained for the metal is severely suppressed .",
    "this is because , the highest contribution for the metal is at @xmath19 , which can not be sampled in our finite size simulation .",
    "thus we are able to sample the @xmath20 at some low but finite @xmath17 where the conductivity has already fallen very sharply .",
    "as we increase @xmath0 the dc conductivity for low @xmath15 gets severely suppressed by several orders of magnitude and the system is an insulator even for @xmath21 .",
    "this is due to the emergence of significant amount of inhomogeneity in the charge density landscape at @xmath21 .",
    "as we increase @xmath0 further , the amount of induced disorder increases further , suppressing conductivity even further . for @xmath22 ,",
    "a small gap at half filling opens up , which seperates the occupied and unoccupied states .",
    "fig 4b shows the finite size scaling effect on the @xmath23 vs @xmath15 curves for @xmath22 , where we have taken @xmath24 = 26,28,30 , all of which show insulating behaviour .",
    "we have convinced ourselves that the result of finite size scaling on the gap at half filling , converges to a fixed value for @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "we find very high thermally activated conductivity which increases by several orders of magnitude .",
    "a heterostructure system arising due to the sandwich of a barrier with finite width and onsite correlations between two metallic planes is studied .",
    "there are multiple gaps in the spectrum , with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "an inhomogeneous spin and charge profile develops in the system . dc",
    "conductivity calculations have been performed showing that the system is an insulator both in the gapped and gapless region .",
