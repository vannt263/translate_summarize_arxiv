    "a branch of the solid state physics and electronics called `` spintronics ''  @xcite developed rapidly last years .",
    "the name is due to the decisive role which the electron spin and related magnetic moment play in the transport phenomena studied .",
    "the most important phenomena appear in magnetic junctions containing ferromagnetic layers .",
    "disturbance of spin equilibrium occurs when spin - polarized current flows through the interfaces of the layers .",
    "the disturbance leads to a number of new spin dependent contact phenomena , which are of interest for a theory development and for using under interpretation of experimental data .    to solve equations of motion for the junctions",
    ", we should have true boundary conditions at the interfaces .",
    "the problem of boundary conditions appears here by a natural way .",
    "the most of the published works consider either a contact between ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic materials  @xcite@xcite or between two ferromagnets with collinear magnetic moments such as a domain wall  @xcite . in the both cases , there is a single quantization axis .",
    "meanwhile , the boundary conditions determining spin current through a contact of two noncollinear ferromagnets are significant for a number of problems concerning spin - polarized current induced spin switching  @xcite .",
    "such type of boundary conditions are treated in the present work .    using the boundary conditions derived",
    ", we calculated further the following contact phenomena : magnetization distribution , spin accumulation shift of the contact potential drop and spin accumulation contribution to contact resistance .",
    "the electron magnetization distribution @xmath0 is described by the continuity equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is equilibrium value of the electron magnetization , @xmath3 is spin relaxation time , @xmath4 is the electron magnetization flux density ( the first index determines the magnetization vector direction in the flux , the second one indicates the flux propagation direction ) .    basing on the well known derivation of the quantum mechanical formula for the particle ( electron ) current density  @xcite , we obtain the electron magnetization flux density in the following form : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is electron wavefunction with momentum @xmath7 and spin state @xmath8 , @xmath9 is bohr magneton , @xmath10 are pauli matrices .",
    "let us see how the magnetization flux transforms under rotation of the quantization axis .",
    "such a rotation can be due to electron transfer from one to another magnetic layer of the junction with different direction of the quantization axis as well as rotation of a homogeneous medium quantization axis ( by an external magnetic field , for example ) .",
    "let electric current flow along @xmath11 axis with quantization axis parallel to @xmath12 axis .",
    "the magnetization flux density has single component @xmath13 .",
    "then the electron current goes into another layer with quantization axis parallel to @xmath14 axis that makes an angle @xmath15 with @xmath12 axis .",
    "the quantization axis rotation is described by a spin wave function transformation matrix  @xcite @xmath16    such a transformation of the wave functions leads to transformation of the magnetization flux density , so that a longitudinal component @xmath17 appears with polarization along the new quantization axis @xmath14 as well as a transverse component @xmath18 with perpendicular polarization .",
    "very different spin relaxation times correspond to the longitudinal and transverse polarizations , so only the longitudinal component @xmath17 survives beyond a thin layer of fermi wavelength thickness ( the so called berger ",
    "slonczewski layer , see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "this gives a boundary condition for the electron magnetization flux density at the interface between the ferromagnets @xmath19 : @xmath20    let us see how the partial spin - polarized current densities for spin - up and spin - down electrons transform under changing the quantization axis .",

    "the other boundary condition is imposed on the partial chemical potentials @xmath27 corresponding to spin - up and spin - down electrons . in its derivation , we start from the energy flux continuity condition at the interface between two ferromagnets .",
    "the boltzmann equation for spin - up and spin - down electron distribution functions @xmath28 takes the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is electric potential , @xmath31 is electron velocity , @xmath32 is the electron energy with momentum @xmath7 , @xmath33 is collision integral .",
