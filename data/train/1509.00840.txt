    "the fit and the corresponding residuals , using the @xmath186 statistic , are shown in the top and bottom panels in figure  [ fig : srcspec ] , respectively .",
    "for this model , we checked the possible presence of a pl component and found it to improve the fit only at the 90% confidence level and contribute @xmath194% and @xmath214% ( @xmath195 upper limit ) of the rest - frame 0.2411.8 kev unabsorbed luminosity , if we fixed @xmath192 at 2.0 and 3.0 , respectively .",
    "ultrasoft x - ray spectra are also often fitted with a single - temperature blackbody ( bb , _ bbodyrad _ in xspec ) , and our fits with this model are given in table  [ tbl : spfit ] . because the residuals in 0.51 kev seen in the mcd fit are also present in the bb fit , we also tried a gaussian line , an edge and a warm absorber to account for them .",
    "generally , the fits using a bb have a @xmath186 value higher by 48 than those using a mcd .",
    "the bb temperatures inferred are in the range between 0.100.13 kev .    finally , we roughly estimated the bh mass with the agn spectral model _ optxagnf _ ( in xspec ) by @xcite , assuming that the x1 spectrum is due to pure thermal disk emission ( subject to a warm absorber ) .",

    "the source is clearly brighter at the end of the observation than at the beginning .",
    "the probability that the count rate is constant ( excluding the high background flaring period ) is @xmath220 , from the @xmath186 test",

    "we extracted a low - state spectrum from the first 28 ks of the observation and a high - state spectrum from the last 14 ks of the observation , excluding data in the high background intervals , and obtained the 0.61.2 kev to 0.20.6 kev pn count rate ratio to be @xmath223 and @xmath224 , respectively .",
    "therefore the spectrum is softer at lower flux , at the @xmath225 significance level .",
    "we fitted these low - state and high - state spectra with the mcd model subject to a fast - moving warm absorber ( section  [ sec : spmodel ] ) .",
    "the chance probability of improving the fit by adding the warm absorber is still low , 0.0003 and 0.001 for the low - state and high - state spectra , respectively , based on the posterior predictive @xmath206-value method using 10,000 simulations for each spectrum .",
    "the parameters of the neutral and ionized absorption were consistent with and thus fixed at values inferred from the fit to the average spectrum of the whole observation .",
    "we obtained the disk parameters @xmath226 kev and @xmath227 for the low - state spectrum and @xmath228 kev and @xmath229 for the high - state spectrum .",
    "the disk temperatures differ by 33 ev at the 4.3@xmath230 confidence level , while the inner disk radii differ by 24% at the 2.2@xmath230 confidence level .",

    "therefore one explanation for the short - term variability in x1 is fast change of the inner disk radius at an approximately constant mass accretion rate into the disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : srclc ] shows that the change occurred within @xmath510 ks .",
    "j1521 + 0749 is an ultrasoft x - ray transient consistent with the center of a galaxy at @xmath0 .",
    "this galaxy is consistent with an old ( @xmath156gyr ) , passive stellar population , based on our modeling of its sdss spectrum , which shows no clear emission lines .",
    "the @xmath146 upper limit of the bolometric luminosity of the persistent nuclear activity estimated from the [ ] upper limit is nearly three orders of magnitude lower than the peak x - ray luminosity in x1 .",
    "therefore we disfavor agn activity as the explanation for the x - ray flare . instead , it is a good soft tde candidate .",
    "we only have one x - ray detection ( x1 ) , which does not allow us to formally test whether the event follows a @xmath6 decline .",
    "however , we have a deep observation c1 relatively close to x1 ( i.e. , 4.7 months before x1 ) , and the non - detection of the source in that observation allows us to constrain the disruption time @xmath172 to be close to or after c1 . in figure",
    "[ fig : lumlc ] , we plot a possible @xmath171 decay curve , with @xmath172 assumed to be at the time of c1 .",
    "the non - detection limits of our source in s1 and x2 , the latter of which is relatively deep , are consistent with this curve .",
    "we fortunately caught the x - ray flare in a deep observation ( x1 ) .",
    "we detected short - term flux and spectral variability in x1 , with the x - ray spectrum being softer at lower flux . based on our spectral modeling",
    ", the variability could be due to change in the inner disk truncation radius , by 24% within @xmath510 ks , at a constant mass accretion rate .",
    "the variation timescale is thus 40 ks , close to the viscosity timescale at the innermost stable circular orbit , which is @xmath570 ks , assuming a viscosity parameter of 0.1 , a ratio of the disk thickness to the inner disk radius of 0.1 , and a bh mass of @xmath170  ( see equation 5.69 in * ? ? ?",
    "therefore the short - term variability in x1 could be due to viscosity instability of the disk .",
    "another soft tde candidate that we discovered in @xcite also showed strong short - term variability in two deep _ xmm - newton _ observations in the flare peak .",
    "we suggested the cause of its short - term variability to be the fast change in the mass accretion rate , considering the increase of the inner disk temperature with the flux as inferred from the fits to a low - state spectrum and a high - state spectrum in the second ( brighter ) _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "we revisit this problem using the procedure as we adopted for j1521 + 0749 , by calculating the mass accretion rate directly through @xmath234 for the mcd when fitting the low - state and high - state spectra of the second _ xmm - newton _ observation and fixing the absorption column density at the value inferred from the fit to the average spectrum from the whole observation ( in @xcite , we allowed the column density to be free but tied between the two spectra in fits ; fixing the column density instead allows to obtain better constraints on the mcd parameters and thus more accurate comparison between the two spectra ) . in this way the disk temperatures of the low - state and high - state spectra were found to differ by 10 ev at the 7.9@xmath230 confidence level , the inner disk radii by 17% at the 3.3@xmath230 confidence level , and the mass accretion rates by 1% , less than 1@xmath230 uncertainty .",
    "therefore the short - term variability in could also be due to change in the inner disk truncation radius at a constant mass accretion rate caused by disk instability , as we suggest for j1521 + 0749 .",
    "the tde candidate also showed short - term variability , but its cause is not clear @xcite .",
    "galactic stellar - mass bh x - ray binaries in the thermal disk dominated state tend to show very weak short - term variability @xcite .",
    "the short - term variability could be a unique phenomenon for soft tdes .",
    "we also detected some edge residuals in 0.51 kev when fitting the x1 spectrum with a mcd .",
    "one explanation for them is the presence of a fast - moving warm absorber .",
    "this absorber could be the radiation - driven outflow expected when the stellar debris fallbacks and accretes onto the bh at a super - eddington rate @xcite .",
    "in , @xcite also detected an edge , at @xmath50.66 kev , whose cause is not clear .",
    "we did not detect uv or optical variability between x1 and x2 .",
    "although we expect strong uv / optical emission from the disk and the outflow in the flare peak , such emission could be still too faint to be detected , maybe because our om observations are not very deep and/or the galactic stellar emission is too strong .",
    "based on @xcite , the peak @xmath235-band ( close to the om @xmath236 filter ) emission has the ab magnitude about 22.3 mag for a tde of @xmath127 within @xmath169@xmath170  at the distance of j1521 + 0749 ( i.e. , @xmath145 mpc ) , while the galaxy has a @xmath236-band magnitude of @xmath49 based on the x2 observation ( table  [ tbl : xmmom ] ) .",
    "the disk uv / optical emission can also be estimated from modeling the x - ray spectrum of x1 .",
    "for this , it is very important to take into account the irradiation of the outer disk by the inner disk emission .",
    "therefore we adopted the irradiated disk model _",
    "diskir _ in xspec @xcite .",
    "we assumed pure thermal disk emission , as the compton tail was found to be very weak .",
    "the reddening relation @xmath237 was adopted .",
    "the warm absorber was also required in the fit , but it was assumed to be dust - free .",
    "the outer disk radius was set to be 1000 times of the inner disk radius , which corresponds to @xmath5100 times of the tidal disruption radius for a bh of @xmath170  @xcite .",
    "the fraction of bolometric flux thermalized in the outer disk @xmath238 is assumed to be 0.1 , which is unfeasibly large ( @xmath238 is typically @xmath5@xmath239 in stellar - mass bh x - ray binaries , * ? ? ?",
    "even adopting the above assumptions that favor the uv / optical emission , we still found that such emission is about one order of magnitude fainter than the galaxy emission ( or the detection limit ) in the om filters used in x1 ( table  [ tbl : xmmom ] ) .",
    "because of the super - eddington accretion in tdes , relativistic outflows could be launched and interact with interstellar medium , resulting in transient radio synchrotron emission that peaks at @xmath50.11 mjy ( if the source is within gpc distances ) in @xmath51 yr after the disruption @xcite . however , despite discovery of two jetted hard tde candidates , there is no clear evidence that soft tdes also launch relativistic jets , because , thus far , there is no radio detection that can be unambiguously ascribed to a relativistic jet in soft tdes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "we searched the very large array ( vla ) archival images and found only one after 2000 april when our event occurred .",
    "it was taken on 2000 august 8 ( close to x1 in time ) in the l band ( 1.4 ghz ) .",
    "our source was not detected , with 3@xmath230 upper limit about 0.8 mjy ( three times the rms value at the location of our source ) .",
    "the non - detection is not constraining because the radio emission from the jet , even if it was launched , should be still weak at the beginning of the flare @xcite .",
    "the relatively large positional uncertainty of j1521 + 0749 does not rule out that it resulted from disruption of a main - sequence star by a massive bh residing in an off - nuclear ( projected offset @xmath2402 kpc ) globular cluster in sdss j152130.72 + 074916.5 .",
    "however , this explanation should not be very promising because if the bh mass is @xmath5@xmath169@xmath170  as inferred from the x - ray spectral fit ( section  [ sec : spmodel ] ) the cluster might have a much higher mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and thus would be very rare , especially for a host that is not very massive .",
    "the rate of disrupting a normal star by a massive bh in a globular cluster is also predicted to be extremely low ( @xmath13@xmath241 yr@xmath3 per globular cluster ) , especially at late times ( @xmath42 gyr , * ? ? ?",
    "the bh inferred for our source is relatively small but might still be a little too large for the white dwarf ( wd ) tidal disruption , which requires the bh mass to be @xmath13@xmath242  if the disruption needs to be outside the event horizon or smaller if the disruption is desired to be outside the innermost stable circular orbit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the wd tde is more prone to produce an energetic jet , thus hard x - ray emission , than the main - sequence star tde , because the high density of wds can support a strong magnetic field on the bh @xcite . even in the case of a slow jet",
    "when the emission could be dominated by the jet photospheric thermal emission , the spectrum is unlikely to be as soft as in j1521 + 0749 , due to comptonization and broadening with pair production @xcite .",
    "based on the above considerations , we disfavor the wd tde explanation for j1521 + 0749 .",
    "the supersoft x1 spectrum of j1521 + 0749 is hardly seen in grbs , even for the small ultralong class .",
    "only the ultralong grb 060218 showed a similarly soft spectrum ( photon index @xmath55.5 , * ? ? ?",
    "the main problem of associating j1521 + 0749 with an ultralong grb is that its host is consistent with an early - type galaxy , while most ultralong grbs have hosts showing intensive star forming activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our source is unlikely to be a sn , because sne hardly have @xmath243 erg  s@xmath3 and supersoft x - ray spectra .",
    "while the shock breakout in sn 2008d had peak @xmath8 similar to j1521 + 0749 and showed relatively soft spectra ( maximum photon index @xmath53.2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the event was short ( @xmath244 s ) and had a fast rise , exponential decay profile .",
    "in contrast , the x1 observation of j1521 + 0749 was long ( @xmath513 hrs ) and had much more steady count rates ( the second half of the observation had 0.22 kev pn count rates higher by 60% than those in the first half only ) . although the shock breakout in a massive star exposion might last for hours @xcite , the x1 observation of j1521 + 0749 was still too long and had too steady count rates to be part of such an event ; the old stellar environment of j1521 + 0749 also argues against the explanation of a massive star explosion .",
    "j1521 + 0749 appears in the direction of the cluster of galaxies ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "its candidate host galaxy is not a member of this cluster .",
    "j1521 + 0749 is relatively close to , but still too far away to be in , two galaxies in the cluster , ( @xmath246 or @xmath247 mpc ) and ( @xmath248 or @xmath249 mpc , see figure  [ fig : cfhtimg ] ) .",
    "we can rule out j1521 + 0749 as a coronally active star based on the ratio of the 0.2 - 12 kev maximum flux to the @xmath165-band flux , which is @xmath250 for j1521 + 0749 , much higher than seen in coronally active stars ( @xmath251 , * ? ? ?",
    "the ultrasoft spectrum makes j1521 + 0749 similar to supersoft x - ray sources ( sss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are mostly cooling white dwarfs ( wds ; * ? ? ? * ) or nuclear burning of the hydrogen - rich matter on the surface of a wd in the so - called close binary supersoft sources or supersoft novae @xcite .",
    "j1521 + 0749 is unlikely to be a cooling wd due to its large variability @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely to be a close binary supersoft source or a supersoft novae either , because such objects are uncommon ( only a few tens found in our galaxy , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the chance to find one consistent with the center of a bright galaxy is essentially zero .",
    "therefore j1521 + 0749 is best explained as a soft tde .",
    "its high - quality x - ray data in x1 have allowed us to search for short - term variability and carry out detailed spectral modeling , which revealed rich information of the accretion process in the event .",
    "few tde candidates have such high - quality x - ray data .",
    "more soft tdes of similar quality are needed to check whether the short - term variability and the edge that we detected in j1521 + 0749 are common in such events and to understand their origins .",
