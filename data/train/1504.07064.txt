    "the orr  sommerfeld  squire equation for a generic single - phase problem in the hydrodynamic stability of a parallel flow can be written down in generic form as follows : @xmath0 the stability problem is solved at a particular set of wavenumbers @xmath1 , and the orr  sommerfeld  squire matrices @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the eigenvalue @xmath4 all depend on the wavenumbers .",
    "the extension to the two - phase case is carried out below in section  [ sec : twophase ] .",
    "recall , the state vector @xmath5 is obtained by writing the wall - normal velocity and vorticity in a finite chebyshev approximation : @xmath6 such that @xmath7    in our previous work  @xcite , we have demonstrated how the matrices in equation   can be used to solve the corresponding initial - value problem .",
    "the initial - value problem is formulated as follows :    @xmath8    with initial condition @xmath9[eq : os_ivp_all ]    and where    @xmath10      in reference  @xcite , we have shown how the solution to equation   can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , keeping @xmath13 finite .",

    "previously ( e.g. in reference  @xcite ) we used a trapezoidal rule .",
    "however , in the present calculations , we have found by trial and error that the backward euler method is the most accurate one for our purposes , and a particular advantage of the backward euler method is its large domain of stability .",
    "an obvious solution to equation   ( yet equivalent to the one in equation  ) is    @xmath16    where @xmath17 are an eigenvector - eigenvalue pair : @xmath18 where @xmath19 for the problem in equation  .",
    "this solution is a complete solution provided the eigenvectors form a complete basis , that is , the matrix @xmath20 [ eq : os_sln_eigs ]    is invertible .",
    "we work with the assumption that @xmath21 is indeed invertible , but that @xmath22 is not a diagonal matrix because the eigenvalue problem is non - normal .",
    "the problem here is to relate the @xmath23-coefficients to the initial data in equation  .",
    "we define @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the usual basis in @xmath26 , @xmath27 denotes the usual scalar product on the same , and @xmath28 . from equation",
    "we have @xmath29 hence @xmath30 also from equation   we have @xmath31 hence @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 it therefore follows from these calculations and from equation   that @xmath15^p = v{\\mathrm{e}}^{\\lambda t}v^{-1 } \\label{eq : evolop_all}\\ ] ] where again the limit @xmath12 is taken in equation  , keeping @xmath35 finite . throughout this work ,",
    "both methods have been used with identical results , although using the eigenvalue / eigenvector method has proved more expedient in certain situations .",
    "the idea of the transient - growth calculation is to start with the energy norm @xmath36 and at each point in time to optimize the energy norm subject to the constraint that @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting maximum energy is called the _ maximum amplification factor _ , @xmath38 .",
    "these calculations can be done within the framework of section  [ sec : background ] as follows .",
    "first , the energy norm in equation   is identified with a scalar product on the space of admissible @xmath5-vectors : @xmath39,\\qquad e_x=\\frac{dx}{dz}=2,\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2k^2}\\sum_{i , j}a_i^ * a_j   \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}e_x^2\\int_{-1}^1 t_i'(x)t_j'(x){\\mathrm{d}}x\\right ) + \\frac{1}{2k^2}\\sum_{i , j}a_i^",

    "however , we have @xmath44 hence @xmath45 thus , the optimization to be performed can be recast as an optimization of the functional @xmath46=\\frac{1}{2k^2}\\langle { \\bm{\\chi}}_0 , { \\mathcal{e}}_t^\\dagger{\\mathbb{t}}{\\mathcal{e}}_t{\\bm{\\chi}}_0\\rangle,\\ ] ] subject to the constraint that @xmath47 in other words , we have the following lagrange - multiplier problem : @xmath46=\\frac{1}{2k^2}\\langle { \\bm{\\chi}}_0 , { \\mathcal{e}}_t^\\dagger{\\mathbb{t}}{\\mathcal{e}}_t{\\bm{\\chi}}_0\\rangle-\\lambda\\left(\\frac{1}{2k^2}\\langle { \\bm{\\chi}}_0 , { \\mathbb{t}}{\\bm{\\chi}}_0\\rangle-1\\right).\\ ] ] the optimum vector is obtained by setting @xmath48 in other words , @xmath49 equation   is a generalized eigenvalue problem , and it is readily checked that the eigenvalues are real ( both matrices appearing in the problem are hermitian ) and moreover , that the eigenvalues are non - negative .",
    "it can be further shown by a straightforward calculation ( backsubstitution into the constrained functional ) that @xmath50-\\lambda\\left(\\frac{1}{2k^2}\\langle { \\bm{\\chi}}_0 , { \\mathbb{t}}{\\bm{\\chi}}_0\\rangle-1\\right)\\right]=\\max \\lambda,\\ ] ] where the maximum is taken over the spectrum of the generalized eigenvalue problem  .",
    "thus , at each point in time , the maximum amplification factor is @xmath51      we have validated this procedure against the known test case of poiseuille flow .",
    "we work in the units used by orzag and other later researchers for their stability calculations of single - phase poiseuille flow  @xcite .",
    "thus , we take @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and two cases for the reynolds number : @xmath54 ( asymptotically stable ) and @xmath55 ( asymptotically unstable ) . a comparison between known results for @xmath38 in this instance and the results from our own calculations",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : validate ] .",
    "it is now of interest to examine the behavior demonstrated in figure  [ fig : validate ] a little further .",
    "we go back over to our own units based on the full channel height and the friction velocity and examine the features of the transient growth in the supercritical case @xmath55 , @xmath56 , for various times @xmath57 $ ] ( corresponding to times @xmath58re_*/2 $ ] in figure  [ fig : validate ] ) .",
    "the resulting study is presented in figure  [ fig : validate ] where it should be noticed that it is the square root of the energy of the most - amplified disturbance that is plotted in a wavenumber space , for different @xmath59-values .",
    "for very short times ( @xmath60 ) the transiently most - amplified mode has a wavevector with components in both the streamwise and spanwise directions ( at @xmath60 , @xmath61 occurs at @xmath62 ) .",
    "as time goes by , the most - amplified mode moves to a more spanwise wavenumber such that by @xmath63 the maximum value @xmath61 occurs at @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "thereafter , there is a slow evolution of the trajectory of the most - amplified disturbance through the wavenumber space away from spanwise wavenumbers towards streamwise ones ( the eigenvalue theory predicts that as @xmath66 the most - amplified disturbance is a streamwise - only mode  figure  [ fig : eigs ] ) .",
    "by @xmath67 the asymptotic state is reached and the most - amplified disturbance is indeed streamwise - only .     and to be read in conjunction with figure  [ fig : alphabeta ] : eigenvalue of most - dangerous mode of the orr ",
    "sommerfeld  squire equations , with @xmath54 .",
    "the most - dangerous mode according to eigenvalue analysis ( valid as @xmath66 ) is a streamwise one.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "application of the basic method described above to two - phase flows with surface tension has produced significant quantitative differences between the present method and the existing test cases in the literature ( e.g. reference  @xcite ) , albeit that the qualitative trends are the same .",
    "we have investigated this , and the discrepancy can be reduced ( in many cases eliminated entirely ) by projecting out the most _ stable _ eigenmodes from the transient - growth calculations . the methodology for doing this",
    "is described below .",
    "first , in more detail , the evolution operator @xmath68 involves all eigenmodes that arise in the truncated chebyshev expansion of the full problem .",
    "it is well known that only the most unstable eigenmodes are computed accurately in the chebyshev collocation method .",
    "therefore , contributions to the evolution operator coming from highly _ stable _ modes will lead to numerical error .",
    "although such stable modes are of no interest an an eigemode analysis ( or more generally , in any kind of analysis wherein the limit @xmath66 is taken ) , they could interfere with transient - growth calculations at finite time .",
    "therefore , as in the standard literature on transient growth , the proposal here is to project such modes out of the evolution operator .    to do this , an approximate solution to the initial value problem",
    "is proposed involving only the first @xmath69 modes : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 label the phases .",
    "the solution   is substituted into our calculation for the energy norm , which for a two - phase flow experiencing surface tension but no gravity , reads @xmath73+\\frac{k^4}{we}|f_0|^2\\bigg\\ } , \\label{eq : et_twophase}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the weber number and @xmath75 represents the interface disturbance . in order to do this calculation ,",
    "we need for example expressions such as the following , valid for either one of the phases : @xmath76 which can be done in the chebyshev expansion as follows : @xmath77 similarly , @xmath78 for either phase . in this way , it is clear that @xmath79\\\\ + \\frac{1}{2k^2}\\sum_{q , q'}\\kappa_q\\kappa_{q'}\\left[\\sum_{l , g}\\left(\\sum_{jj'}a_{j(q)}\\mathbb{t}_{jj'}^{(1)}a_{j'(q')}^ * + k^2\\sum_{jj'}a_{j(q)}\\mathbb{t}_{jj'}^{(0)}a_{j'(q')}^ * + \\sum_{jj'}b_{j(q)}\\mathbb{t}_{jj'}^{(0)}b_{j'(q')}^*\\right ) \\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : et_twophase1}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] clearly , this is a grotesque expression but it can be ameliorated .",
    "let us momentarily revert to an eigenvalue with a single component , with @xmath80=\\mathrm{eig}\\left(\\mathcal{l},\\mathcal{m}\\right)$ ] say , where the @xmath81 column of the matrix @xmath21 corresponds to the @xmath82 eigenvector , with @xmath83 ( say ) .",
    "then , for any @xmath84 _ symmetric _ matrix @xmath85 , we have @xmath86 hence , by introducing the matrix @xmath87 it should be clear from equation   that equation   can be rewritten as @xmath88 where now @xmath89 is an @xmath90 matrix where each column is an eigenvector of the full problem , where @xmath91 ; in other words , the @xmath82 column of @xmath89 is the eigenvector @xmath92 we consider again equation  . because the @xmath93 s are weights in an eigenfunction expansion of the solution of a linear evolutionary equation , we have @xmath94 , where @xmath23 is a constant .",
    "thus , @xmath95 where the last line makes use of an obvious notation .",
    "the relation @xmath96 is our final expression for the energy of a disturbance involving only the first @xmath69 eigenmodes : a subscript @xmath69 has been introduced ( with @xmath97 ) to remind ourselves that only @xmath69 eigenmodes are used in the expansions .",
    "we carry out several consistency checks on our calculations .",
    "the first one involves checking that the matrix multiplication @xmath98 makes sense .",
    "we first of all note the size of the various matrices : @xmath89 is a @xmath90 matrix and @xmath99 is a matrix of size @xmath84 .",
    "hence , doing the ` cross multiplication ' check to see if the product @xmath98 is defined , we have @xmath100 and the matrix multiplication is therefore consistent .",
    "next , we would also like to check that @xmath101 agrees with our earlier expressions for the energy , recalled here from section  [ sec : basic ] as @xmath102 clearly , if we set @xmath103 in equation   and @xmath104 in equation   we have @xmath105 and the two approaches are identical ( and hence consistent ) when @xmath106 . however , even when @xmath107 , we can identify @xmath108 in equation  , which will be helpful in what follows .    we obtain the maximum growth @xmath38 in the usual way by maximizing the constrained problem",
    "@xmath109=\\frac{1}{2k^2 } \\langle\\vec{\\mu},\\left({\\mathrm{e}}^{\\lambda_q^*t}v_q^\\dagger\\mathbb{t}v_q{\\mathrm{e}}^{\\lambda_q t}\\right)\\vec{\\mu}\\rangle -\\lambda\\left[\\frac{1}{2k^2 } \\langle\\vec{\\mu},\\left(v_q^\\dagger\\mathbb{t}v_q\\right)\\vec{\\mu}\\rangle-1\\right],\\ ] ] as before , the maximum growth rate is obtained by setting @xmath110 hence @xmath111 and hence @xmath112=\\max \\lambda = g(t).\\ ] ] the optimal vector is the corresponding eigenvector of the problem . in the usual basis ,",
    "the optimal vector is given by the transformation @xmath113 .",
    "we have validated these calculations with respect to figures  4 and  5 in reference  @xcite and the results are shown below in figure  [ fig : xcompare4 ] and  [ fig : xcompare5 ] . in our calculations , we used @xmath114 chebyshev collocation points in each phase , and carried out the transient - growth calculations using only the first 10 eigenmodes .",
    "these choices were made on a trial - and - error basis : @xmath115 were varied to obtain numerical convergence , and the cutoff of number of eigenmodes was varied so as to find maximum agreement between the present calculations and those in the reference text .",
    "there are some discrepancies between the two approaches in figure  [ fig : xcompare4 ] while no such discrepancies are in evidence in figure  [ fig : xcompare5 ] .",
    "the small discrepancies are not concerning , since the results depend slightly on the cutoff number of eigenmodes in the calculations , and this is not stated explicitly in the reference text .",
    "however , the excellent agreement between the two approaches in figure  [ fig : xcompare5 ] reinforces our confidence in our own implementation of the transient - growth calculation .",
