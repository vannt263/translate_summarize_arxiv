    "the last candidate for the fundamental theory of hadronic force is the quark model .",
    "the interaction between quarks is described by the exchange of the non - abelian gauge fields called gluons .",
    "quarks were introduced by gellman and zweig for the first time in 1964 . besides the successfulness of the quark model , no free quark has been observed yet .",
    "however , the particles in the lagrangian of any theory must exist in the physical spectrum .",
    "now that the quarks appear in the qcd lagrangian , the main question is as follows : where are the quarks ?",
    "are they permanently confined ?",
    "in fact , these are not the quarks which are not found in the nature but it is the color which is confined and quarks are confined because of their colors . in other words , particles with color degrees of freedom are confined .",
    "therefore , all free particles are colorless , and colored particles can not be found in the particle spectrum .",
    "also gluons , particles in the adjoint representation of the gauge group of qcd have colors , and are absent in the particle spectrum , as well .",
    "let us define confinement from the point of view of the potential in a quark - antiquark pair . at short distances",
    "the potential in a quark - antiquark pair is coulombic and can be explained by the gluon exchange between quarks .",
    "since the coupling constant is small , perturbative methods work very well in this region . as the distances between quarks",
    "increase , the coupling constant increases as well and perturbative techniques do not work anymore .",
    "this happens at an intermediate regime where the potential between quarks rises linearly until the energy reaches a point where it is large enough to create a quark - antiquark pair in the vacuum .",
    "then , these secondary pairs couple to the initial ones and screen them .",
    "however , by removing the dynamical quarks from the theory , the creation of the secondary quarks does not happen and the potential between the initial quarks rises linearly with distance .",
    "figure ( [ pot ] ) shows a typical behavior of the potential between static quark s , a coulombic potential at short distances , and a linear potential for intermediate and large distances . for this figure , dynamical quarks are removed from the theory .",
    "the linear behavior is confirmed by regge trajectories in the particle spectrum @xcite .",
    "the flux tube created at this linear regime has nonlinear nature , and it is not possible to use ordinary perturbation methods to study its characteristics .",
    "therefore , to investigate the quark confinement phenomena , one should use nonperturbative methods .",
    "lattice gauge theory has been very successful to reproduce the potential between pairs of colored particles like quarks and gluons .",
    "other approaches used to study confinement include phenomenological models . in these models ,",
    "the qcd vacuum is filled with some topological configurations confining colored objects .",
    "the most popular candidates among these topological fields are monopoles and vortices .",
    "other candidates include merons , calorons,@xmath3 .",
    "there are very strong correlations between these various objects , though .",
    "therefore , the mechanism of confinement has not been understood by a unique procedure yet , and it is one of the unsolved mysteries of quantum chromodynamics .    in this paper , we study the center vortex model within the g(2 ) gauge group .",
    "the center vortex model was initially introduced by t hooft @xcite .",
    "it was able to explain the confinement of quark pairs , but it was not able to explain the intermediate linear potential , especially for higher representations.the model has been improved to the thick center vortex model by m. faber @xmath4 @xcite . even though it is a simple model , the thick center vortex model reproduces the intermediate linear potential qualitatively , in agreement with casimir scaling and the asymptotic large distance potential which is proportional to the @xmath5-ality of the gauge group .",
    "for intermediate distances , one expects to see a linear potential proportional to the distance between quarks , in agreement with lattice calculations . based on lattice results @xcite ,",
    "the coefficient of the linear part which is called the string tension , is proportional to the eigenvalue of t he quadratic casimir operator of the corresponding representation .",
    "this is called casimir scaling .",
    "the casimir scaling regime is expected to extend roughly from the onset of confinement to the onset of screening .",
    "the @xmath5-ality of each representation is given by mod(@xmath6 ) , where @xmath7 is the number of quarks and @xmath8 is the number of antiquarks constructing the representation . at large distances , where the distance between the quark and antiquark increases , the energy stored in the string increases and gluon pairs are created from the vacuum .",
    "these gluons screen the initial sources to the lowest dimension with the same @xmath5-ality . in this regime ,",
    "sources with the same @xmath5-ality obtain the same string tensions .",
    "those with zero @xmath5-ality are completely screened .    in the vortex model the qcd vacuum is filled with linelike ( in three dimensions ) or surfacelike ( in four dimensions ) objects , which carry magnetic flux quantized in terms of the center elements of the gauge group . at large distances between color sources ,",
    "the interactions between wilson loops and center vortices lead to a linear potential proportional to the @xmath5-ality of the given representation .",
    "besides the successes of the center vortex model , the relation between confinement and center symmetry has not been understood very well , yet . to study the role of center elements , one of the attractive methods is studying confinement in gauge groups without nontrivial center elements , like g(@xmath0 ) .",
    "lattice calculations in g(@xmath0 ) @xcite show color screening for large distances and a linear potential for intermediate distances .",
    "since the center is trivial , the center vortex model predicts color screening .",
    "it is not so clear why a linear potential can be expected at intermediate distances .",
    "because of these two features confinement at intermediate distances and screening at large distances g(2 ) gauge theory resembles su(@xmath5 ) gauge theories with dynamical quarks .",
    "these screen static quarks at large distances .",
    "therefore , g(@xmath0 ) is considered as a mathematical laboratory to examine the properties of su(@xmath5 ) gauge theories , even the ones which can not be understood in su(@xmath5 ) gauge theories themselves .    in the next section",
    ", we give a brief review of the thin and thick center vortex models . in sec.iii , some general features of the g(2 ) gauge group are discussed , and in sec.iv we apply the improved thick center vortex model , called the domain structure model , to the g(@xmath0 ) gauge group .",
    "we study the possible reasons why confinement is observed in the g(@xmath0 ) gauge group based on its su(3 ) subgroups .",
    "potentials between static sources of higher representations , @xmath9 and @xmath1 , are calculated in sec.v , and casimir scaling is discussed .",
    "we end the paper with a conclusion .",
    "the idea of describing confinement using vortices goes back to t hooft @xcite . in four dimensions vortices are topological field configurations of the vacuum forming closed surfaces which can be linked to wilson loops .",
    "wilson loops are gauge - invariant observables obtained from the holonomy of the gauge connection around given loops .",
    "confinement is obtained from random fluctuations in the linking number .",
    "a vortex piercing a wilson loop contributes with a center element @xmath10 somewhere between the group elements @xmath11 of the gauge group @xmath12\\longrightarrow \\mathrm{tr}[uuu\\ldots(z)\\ldots u].\\ ] ] because center elements commute with all the members of the group , the location of @xmath10 in eq.([wilson ] ) is arbitrary .",
    "the effect of piercings on wilson loops can be well understood in the gauge group su(@xmath0 ) , which has @xmath13 as the only nontrivial center element .",
    "@xmath14 is the @xmath15 unit matrix .",
    "vortices piercing the loop an even number of times or not piercing it at all , do not have any effect on @xmath16 .",
    "odd linking numbers change the sign of @xmath16 .",
    "one can derive a formula for the string tension @xmath17 assuming that vortices are thin and pierce wilson loops in single plaquettes with independent probabilities @xmath18 .",
    "we get @xmath19\\langle w_0(c)\\rangle\\ ] ] assuming that @xmath20 is the expectation value of the loop when no vortex pierces this loop and the string tension is @xmath21 the vortex model works very well for the fundamental representation , and it gives the asymptotic string tension correctly .",
    "it also works well for the adjoint representation at large distances , where one expects a screened potential .",
    "since we have a trivial center element for the adjoint representation , the string tension must be zero according to eq.([wilson ] ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath10 is unity and it does not change the wilson loop .",
    "however , lattice calculations show an intermediate string tension for higher representations @xcite , which can not be predicted by the thin center vortex model or eq.([wilson ] ) . m. faber @xmath22 @xcite have improved the model to the thick center vortex model to be able to reproduce the intermediate string tensions .",

    "( [ cartan ] ) that the weight diagram of the g(@xmath0 ) fundamental representation can be obtained by fig .",
    "( [ weight7 ] ) .",
    "this is because the fundamental representation of g(@xmath0 ) can be decomposed into its su(@xmath2 ) subgroup representations @xmath146 where @xmath2 and @xmath97 show the fundamental representations of the su(@xmath2 ) group .    for the adjoint representation of g(@xmath0 ) with dimension @xmath9 , the decomposition is as follows : @xmath147 the @xmath148 indicates the adjoint representation of su(@xmath2 ) .",
    "thus , the cartan subalgebra of the adjoint representation can be calculated from the weight diagrams of fig .",
    "( [ weight14 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ 3comb ] ) , @xmath149 where @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 are the cartan subgroups of su(@xmath2 ) for the representations @xmath2 , @xmath153 , and @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "representation @xmath1 of the g(@xmath0 ) gauge group is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ rep27 ] ) .",
    "but like the fundamental and adjoint representations of g(@xmath0 ) , the weight diagram of representation @xmath1 can be obtained by decomposition to its su(@xmath2 ) subgroups .",
    "figure ( [ weight27 ] ) shows this decomposition , where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the six dimensional representations of su(@xmath2 ) . in fact , @xmath156 therefore , the cartan subalgebra of representation @xmath1 is @xmath157 we recall that for all representations of g(@xmath0 ) we use the normalization condition @xmath158=\\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{ab}.\\ ] ]    the next step is to find the normalization factors in eq .",
    "( [ alpha0 ] ) for these two new representations .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ expalpha ] ) , with @xmath159 the cartan subgroups of representations @xmath9 and @xmath1 . for both representations @xmath160 and @xmath161 is equal to @xmath162 for the adjoint and @xmath163 for the @xmath1 representation .",
    "now , we are ready to calculate the potentials from eq .",
    "( [ g2potential ] ) with the profile function of eq .",
    "( [ alpha0 ] ) .",
    "( [ all ] ) plots the potentials for the fundamental , adjoint , and @xmath1 representations .",
    "the free parameters @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath18 are chosen to be @xmath122 , @xmath74 , and @xmath123 , respectively . the potentials are screened at large distances , as expected from the fact that g(@xmath0 ) has only a trivial center .",
    "in fact , the representations @xmath9 and @xmath1 lead to a singlet after they combine with gluons that popped out of the vacuum .",
    "this happens when the distance between static sources is large enough and the potential between sources is big enough to create a pair of heavy gluons .",
    "@xmath164 @xmath165 @xmath166 one of the interesting points of the figure is that the sources in the fundamental representation are screened at higher energy than the adjoint sources .",
    "this can be explained by the above equations which indicate that a fundamental quark interacting with three gluons leads to a singlet , while adjoint sources are screened by interacting with one gluon .",
    "therefore , screening happens at higher energies for the fundamental representation compared to the adjoint representation .",
    "the sources of the @xmath1-dimensional representation do not give a singlet after combining with a pair of gluons .",
    "screening happens if the adjoint sources produced from eq .",
    "( [ 27singlet ] ) interact with the adjoint sources again and a singlet is produced according to eq .",
    "( [ 14singlet ] ) .",
    "it is observed from fig.([all ] ) that the potentials are concave at intermediate distances .",
    "it is worse for representation @xmath9 . to get a nonconcave potential and to be able to calculate the string tensions more accurately ,",
    "we use the method of ref .",
    "@xcite which considers some random fluctuations for the vortex profiles .",
    "figure ( [ short - dist ] ) shows the potentials at intermediate distances .",
    "a linear regime is observed for all three representations .",
    "however , the length of this area is very small .",
    "the casimir scaling regime is expected to extend roughly from the onset of confinement to the onset of screening .",
    "string tensions are calculated for @xmath61 between @xmath167 and @xmath168 . from fig .",
    "( [ short - dist ] ) , the string tension ratios are @xmath169 while the casimir ratios are @xmath170 the string tension ratios are qualitatively in rough agreement with casimir ratios .",
    "the agreement between casimir ratios and string tension ratios obtained from the lattice calculations is very good @xcite .",
    "however , we recall that the thick center vortex model predictions for proportionality with casimir scaling for su(@xmath0 ) , su(@xmath2 ) , and su(@xmath74 ) have also been very rough @xcite",
    ". the casimir ratios of representations @xmath1 to @xmath9 is @xmath171 , which is in good agreement with the string tension ratios obtained from the model , about @xmath172 , in eq .",
    "( [ string ratio ] ) .",
    "it is also possible to find the potentials between static sources in other higher representations of the g(@xmath0 ) gauge group , but finding the cartan subalgebra from the weight diagrams would be a little bit harder .",
    "however , studying these three representations of the g(@xmath0 ) gauge group shows that the thick center vortex model , with the idea of the domain structure , works rather w ell even in the g(@xmath0 ) gauge group which has only a trivial center .",
    "studying confinement in gauge groups without nontrivial center elements is an attractive subject .",
    "g(@xmath0 ) is one of these exceptional groups which has only a trivial center .",
    "lattice calculations show some evidence for the confinement of quarks at intermediate distances . on the other hand ,",
    "the thick center vortex model is a phenomenological model which gives potentials between quarks in gauge groups with nontrivial center elements . in this paper , to reproduce the lattice results , the idea of the vacuum domain structure has been used in the thick center vortex model .",
    "a flux has been assigned to the trivial center of the g(@xmath0 ) , gauge group and the potential between two static g(@xmath0 ) quarks is obtained .",
    "the potential is screened at large distances , as expected from the thick center vortex model .",
    "in other words , the trivial center does not affect the wilson loop , where a complete link is established between them at large distances . in this regime ,",
    "the vortex ( domain ) is located completely inside the minimal area of the loop . a linear potential at intermediate distances is observed .",
    "the thickness of the domains and possibly the su(@xmath2 ) subgroups of the g(@xmath0 ) gauge group are responsible for this linear behavior at intermediate distances .",
    "in addition , potentials between static sources of the adjoint and the @xmath1 -dimensional representations are calculated by the model . in both cases ,",
    "the potentials are linear at intermediate distances , and the string tensions are qualitatively in rough agreement with casimir scaling .",
