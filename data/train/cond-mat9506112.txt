    "currently , there is a great deal of discussion about the nature of the superconducting heavy - fermion compunds , especially upt@xmath0 .",
    "much of this discussion has centered on the unusual nature of the superconducting state .",
    "experiments to map out the phase diagram of upt@xmath0 in the field - temperature ( @xmath4 ) plane using both specific heat @xcite and longitudinal sound absorption @xcite and velocity @xcite have revealed multiple superconducting phases . in particular these measurements",
    "show that two superconducting phases exist even at zero field , as was predicted @xcite by an analysis of the free energy for a two - component order parameter in the presence of antiferromagnetism . @xcite the resulting ginzburg - landau (",
    "g - l ) theory makes additional predictions - e.g. the kink in the upper critical field when the field is in the basal plane .",
    "@xcite in these theories , the order parameter transforms as one of the irreducible representations of the @xmath2 point group of the crystal .",
    "either @xmath5 or @xmath6.@xcite    further evidence about the superconducting state of upt@xmath0 comes from measurements of ultrasound @xcite and heat conduction .",
    "@xcite these experiments suggest that there are point nodes in the superconducting gap function where the fermi surface intersects the line @xmath7 and line nodes where the fermi surface intersects the @xmath8 or @xmath9 planes .",
    "this is evidence for a d - wave @xmath1 order parameter which transforms like @xmath10 .",
    "the theorem of blount @xcite states that triplet states can not have lines of nodes when spin - orbit coupling is taken into account .",
    "the theorem assumes that no symmetries are present other than the crystal point group symmetries .",
    "it has been argued that other symmetries may be present in upt@xmath0 @xcite and thus lines of nodes may be present even if the cooper pair is a triplet .",
    "thus the nodal pattern may not prove singlet pairing .    in spite of the success of the @xmath1 model in explaining the nodal structure of the gap function and the existence of multiple superconducting phases ,",
    "certain objections have been raised regarding its suitability as a description of upt@xmath0 .",
    "one objection is that the @xmath1 theory fails to explain the isotropy of the phase diagram , or , in other words , why the phase diagram when the field is parallel to the c - axis of the crystal appears to be similar to the phase diagram when the field is perpendicular to the c - axis .",
    "@xcite we shall argue that there are similarities but also important differences and that the @xmath1 theory does in fact explain the phase diagram for both orientations of @xmath11 .",
    "the other common objection to the @xmath1 theory is that because it is a singlet theory it can not explain why the upper critical field curve for @xmath11 along the c - axis and the curve for @xmath11 in the basal plane cross .",
    "@xcite this crossing is maintained to be a characteristic of triplet theories alone .",
    "@xcite by a careful analysis of the magnetic properties of upt@xmath0 and their contributions to the g - l free energy we will show that pseudo - spin singlet states can also produce this effect .",
    "the plan for the rest of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ math ] the overall mathematical approach to the phase diagram problem is discussed .",
    "it is necessary to go into the method in some detail : only a very careful analysis brings out the nature of the inner phase transition . in sec .",
    "[ basal ] we will take the free energy and use it to obtain the phase diagram when @xmath11 is in the basal plane .",
    "the observed tetracritical point comes out in a natural way . by fitting the theory to the longitudinal velocity data we will obtain values for all the relevant parameters of our theory . then in sec .",
    "[ caxis ] we will obtain the phase diagram for the case when @xmath11 is parallel to the c - axis .",
    "we will show that our theory can be fit to the data for the case when @xmath11 is parallel to the c - axis with the same set of parameters used for the case when @xmath11 is in the basal plane .",
    "the near - crossing of the phase boundaries when @xmath11 is along the c - axis is a consequence of approximate particle - hole symmetry . in sec.[magnetic ] we will discuss the magnetic properties , in particular the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "we will show the effect the susceptibility of upt@xmath0 has on the g - l free energy and how this leads to properties such as the crossing of the upper critical field curves for different directions of the field . in sec .",
    "[ press ] the phase diagram is extended to finite pressure . finally in sec .  [ ending ]",
    "we make some concluding remarks .",
    "this section will be devoted to explaining the mathematical method used to obtain the phase diagram for upt@xmath0 in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the full problem is very complicated .",
    "we give first a simple example to orient the reader to the case of competing order parameters .",
    "the reader who is mainly interested in the overall concept , not the details , may read the first subsection and consult the summary figures in the other subsections .",
    "a simple system with a multicomponent order parameter and competition among the components is a magnet with uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "the free energy is :    @xmath12    suppose that @xmath13",
    ". then at @xmath14 , the system develops a nonzero @xmath15 in the @xmath16-@xmath17 plane , its direction otherwise not determined by @xmath18 .",
    "let us say @xmath19 with @xmath20 given by @xmath21 .",
    "the angle brackets indicate equilibrium values .",
    "the question we face ( which adumbrates the whole theme of this paper ) is : how do @xmath22 and @xmath23 behave below @xmath14",
    "? the first question has a simple answer .",
    "@xmath22 will remain zero below @xmath14 .",
    "one way to see this is to write an effective free energy for @xmath22 below @xmath14 by simply taking the terms in @xmath18 which involve @xmath22 and writing the equilibrium value for @xmath24 and @xmath23 : @xmath25 there will be a temperature range below @xmath14 where @xmath26 .",
    "the fact that the effective free energy is then quartic in @xmath22 is the sign that @xmath24 and @xmath22 are degenerate , and the fact that the minimum of @xmath27 is at @xmath28 indicates that rotation of @xmath29 in the @xmath16-@xmath17 plane will take place only if a magnetic field ( which could be infinitesimal ) is applied .",
    "now do the same for @xmath23 : @xmath30 m_z^2   + \\beta_{z } m_z^4\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there are evidently two possibilities . either the expression in square brackets vanishes at positive @xmath31 , in which case there is a second - order phase transition where @xmath23 appears so that the magnetization rotates in the @xmath16-@xmath32 plane , or it vanishes at negative @xmath31 , which implies that there is no further transition and @xmath33 at all @xmath31 . the rotational phase transition , which is second - order , takes place at a lower critical temperature given by @xmath34 an important point is that @xmath35 , the _ bare _ critical temperature for @xmath23 may be positive but @xmath36 still negative",
    "this would be an example of the effective field suppressing a transition .",
    "if there is a transition ( @xmath37 ) , then the effective free energy is not valid for @xmath38 - it neglects the feedback of @xmath23 on @xmath24 .    of interest",
    "below will be the question of artificial terms such as @xmath39 in the original free energy .",
    "this would add a term @xmath40^{3/2 } m_z$ ] to the effective free energy for @xmath23 .",
    "this means that @xmath23 becomes nonzero already at @xmath14 and the lower transition is converted to a crossover , just as if an external field in the @xmath32-direction were applied .    for finding out whether there is a transition , whether it is second order , and computing",
    "the lower transition temperature , analysis of the effective free energy is all that is required . to find the behavior of the system below @xmath36 , one must minimize of the full free energy .",
    "we now apply the effective field method to the well - known problem of an isotropic s - wave superconductor to show how it works in a case which is actually quite non - trivial , but whose phase diagram is well understood .",
    "this system has a single complex order parameter . in the presence of a field , however , there are , in a certain sense , an infinite number of order parameters , and interesting competition among them .",
    "the free energy density for the system is @xmath41 here @xmath42 ( @xmath43 is the charge on an electron ) and if we take take @xmath11 in the @xmath32-direction , then the gauge @xmath44 is appropriate .",
    "we have @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "our problem is to minimize the free energy @xmath47 for arbitrary @xmath48 and @xmath31 .",
    "the method we will use is to expand the function @xmath49 in a complete set of normalized eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath50 which are @xmath51^{1/4 } e^{-iky}\\exp[-(x - k\\ell^2)^2/2\\ell^2 ] h_n((x - k\\ell^2)/\\ell),\\ ] ] where @xmath52 , @xmath53 are the hermite polynomials , and @xmath54 is the size of the system in the @xmath17-direction .",

    "we have re - expressed @xmath18 as a fourth - order polynomial in an infinite number of variables @xmath63 , which may be thought of formally as competing order parameters .",
    "we must minimize this polynomial .",
    "the upper critical field curve is given by noticing when the coefficient of the quadratic term _ first _ changes sign : @xmath64 the highest value of @xmath48 for which this equation holds corresponds to @xmath65 and the curve @xmath66 defines the normal superconducting phase boundary .",
    "below this boundary , some _ but not all _ of the @xmath63 are nonzero and @xmath67^{1/2 } = \\delta^{1/2}.\\ ] ] this equation defines @xmath68 , which serves as a small quantity in the analysis below , the validity of which is thereby limited to the neighborhood of the phase boundary . @xmath69 in the ordered phase .",
    "the periodicity of the flux lattice shows that @xmath70 if and only if @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is any integer and @xmath73 .",
    "we shall denote this condition by @xmath74 , i.e. @xmath60 belongs to the discrete set which constitutes the flux lattice .",
    "the discreteness reflects the fact that magnetic translation symmetry as well as gauge symmetry are broken in the low-@xmath31 , low-@xmath48 phase .",
    "thus , sufficiently close to the phase boundary , only these coefficients need be computed and we get the familiar theory of the hexagonal flux lattice . as is well known , no further phase transitions take place as the field is lowered until the meissner state takes over at @xmath75 .    in upt@xmath0 ,",
    "on the other hand , there is another transition when the field is reduced .",
    "why does this not occur in the s - wave case ?",
    "the answer is not obvious .",
    "for example , we may consider the landau level @xmath76 .",
    "setting the eigenvalue equal to zero as we did for @xmath65 would give a critical field line with the same @xmath14 but with a slope only 1/3 of the slope of the @xmath77 curve .",
    "why does no transition take place on this line in the @xmath78 plane ? that is , why is there no nonalytic behavior of the @xmath79 on this line ?",
    "what about @xmath80 for @xmath81 ?    to answer these questions , we must develop a picture of the effective fields present in the system when the symmetry has been broken .",
    "this is done by classifying different terms of the polynomial in eq .",
    "[ eq : poly ] .",
    "these are the simplest of all ; the free energy is @xmath83 \\mid c_{0k } \\mid^2 + { \\cal o } ( c_{0k}^4 ) + \\ldots , \\label{eq : p0k}\\ ] ] where only the terms relevant to the behavior of terms in class 1 have been written explicitly .    for small @xmath68 ,",
    "these terms give the simple result @xmath84 where @xmath85 denote collectively the @xmath63 which belong to class 1 . for our considerations which are simply a matter of power counting ,",
    "the indices on @xmath86 are not required at this point .",

    "the @xmath89 builds a hexagonal lattice which interpenetrates the original one , as we shall see below in section [ basal ] .",
    "when @xmath92 these variables are degenerate with the @xmath85 - these are the ones not chosen because of the breaking of the magnetic translation symmetry .",
    "the @xmath93 should be compared to @xmath22 in the previous subsection . as @xmath68 increases",
    ", they become less favored because they feel an effective repulsion from the @xmath85 .",

    "@xcite .",
    "let us briefly review the reasons for this expectation .",
    "if we apply a magnetic field , there will be both a pauli ( intraband ) and a van vleck ( interband ) contribution to the susceptibility .",
    "the former is of order @xmath362 , while the latter is of order @xmath363 . here",
    "@xmath364 is an effective g - factor for the coupling of the field to the total angular momentum of the band or bands involved .",
    "it is a dimensionless number of order unity .",
    "the land factor for @xmath365=3 , s=1/2 , and @xmath366=5/2 is 6/7 .",
    "@xmath367 is the separation between the bands and @xmath368 is the density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "the van vleck susceptibility is given by @xmath369 here @xmath370 , @xmath371 , @xmath372 , @xmath373 are occupation factors and energies of the states @xmath374 and @xmath375 .",
    "in view of the greater multiplicity of the interband transitions , we expect the van vleck susceptibility to be very important - indeed it very likely dominates the total . a band calculation which explicitly computes the two components reckons the pauli contribution at 15 - 20% , @xcite in rough agreement with this multiplicity argument .",
    "if @xmath11 is along the c - axis , then the relevant matrix element ( with @xmath376 ) is : @xmath377 at the @xmath358 point , states of different @xmath378 do not mix and the perturbation introduced by @xmath11 is diagonal . the occupation factors then imply that the van vleck susceptibility is zero for this direction .",
    "if @xmath11 is in the @xmath16-direction , the corresponding expression for the square of the matrix element is @xmath379 if the states @xmath374 and @xmath375 differ by one unit of @xmath378 and is zero otherwise .",
    "the van vleck susceptibility comes from four distinct pairs of states:(@xmath380 ) , ( @xmath381 ) , ( @xmath382 ) and ( @xmath383 ) , whenever one of the pair is occupied and the other unoccupied .",
    "the pauli contribution to @xmath384 , on the other hand , comes only from the pair ( @xmath385 ) when this state is occupied .",
    "a sheet of the fermi surface will have an isotropic partial pauli susceptibility ( @xmath386 ) if different @xmath378 values are well mixed in the wavefunction , but will be anisotropic otherwise : @xmath378=1/2 implies @xmath387 , and @xmath378=3/2 or @xmath378=5/2 implies @xmath388 . as we shall see below , it is the anisotropy of the pauli contribution which is critical for understanding the phase diagram .",
    "this means that the central question is : what is the @xmath378 content of the fermi surface , and how much mixing of different @xmath378 s is there ?",
    "band calculations give a clear answer to this question .",
    "they show that the parts of the fermi surface near the @xmath358 point and k point are predominantly @xmath378=3/2 or 5/2 , @xcite while the parts near the a point are well mixed .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : band ] .",
    "hence we expect a contribution to the pauli susceptibility which satisfies @xmath389 from the parts near @xmath358 and k , representing roughly half the total density of states at the fermi surface , and a contribution satisfying @xmath386 for the rest of the fermi surface . in treatments which go beyond band theory to discuss many - body renormalizations",
    ", it is found that the pauli and van vleck parts are enhanced by similar factors @xcite .",
    "summing up these theoretical considerations , the magnetic susceptibility of upt@xmath0 is likely to be dominated by interband ( van vleck ) contributions .",
    "this is particularly true for @xmath384 , which means that the anisotropy in the oberved susceptibility ( @xmath390 ) most likely stems from interband contributions .",
    "the pauli susceptibility , on the other hand , is more likely to satisfy the opposite inequality @xmath391    experimentally , it is not easy to distinguish the pauli and van vleck contributions to the susceptibility . the most straightforward way , in principle , is to measure the imaginary part of the susceptibility with neutron scattering .",
    "the van vleck contribution has a gap at low frequencies , while the pauli part does not .",
    "for the present case , however , we also need to distinguish the different components of the susceptibility tensor .",
    "this means that polarized beam experiments are required , with the associated lower counting rates .",
    "finally , we are interested here in the uniform susceptibility , which means small - angle scattering .",
    "thus this definitive experiment may be difficult to perform .",
    "a more indirect but still informative test arises from the observation that the pauli susceptibility depends on the density of states at the fermi energy whereas the van vleck susceptibility depends on a joint density of states .",
    "the pauli part is therefore directly comparable to @xmath392 , where @xmath393 is the specific heat . in this regard the peak in @xmath352 at t=15 k @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : chi ] ) is of interest .",
    "this peak is absent in the smooth curve for @xmath353 , and in the the specific heat @xmath394 , @xcite this is consistent with the idea that the physical origins of @xmath395 and @xmath384 are different , and that the density of states at the fermi level largely determines @xmath395 but not @xmath384 .",
    "thus experiments , to the exent that we have them , confirm the theoretical picture .",
    "the importance of these considerations for the superconducting state is simple .",
    "@xcite superconductivity affects the pauli susceptibility in a drastic fashion . for a singlet state such as @xmath1 , the pauli term @xmath396",
    "is reduced to zero at zero temperature because it takes a finite amount of energy to break a pair and magnetize the system .",
    "superconductivity should have no effect at all on the van vleck term , and conversely .",
    "the difference in free energies between the normal and superconducting states in a field is @xmath397 here @xmath398 where @xmath399 and @xmath400 are the pauli susceptibilities in the superconducting and normal states , respectively .",
    "just below the superconducting transition we know that the change in the susceptibility is quadratic in @xmath210 .",
    "hence we add to the usual superconducting free energy the last three terms of eq .",
    "[ fulleng ] which are quadratic in both @xmath210 and @xmath48 .    from the arguments above we expect that @xmath206 and @xmath208 will be smaller than @xmath207 since we anticipate that @xmath391 . from our fits to the phase diagrams for the two directions of the field",
    "we find that @xmath207 is slightly more than twice @xmath401 , in agreement with the physical picture of the susceptibility .",
    "the differences in the sizes of the @xmath212 terms affect what happens to the upper critical field curves for the two directions of the field at high fields . at high fields",
    "the pauli limiting terms in the free energy , which are proportional to @xmath402 , dominate over the rest of the free energy , which gives a contribution to @xmath77 proportional to @xmath48 . because @xmath403 , @xmath77 when the field is along the c - axis curves down more than @xmath77 when the field is in the basal plane .",
    "consequently , the two upper critical field curves for the two directions cross .",
    "this crossing is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossing ] .",
    "we have therefore shown that the objection to the @xmath1 model on the grounds that it can not explain the crossing of the upper critical field curves is invalid .",
    "we have offered a comprehensive description of the phase diagram of upt@xmath0 in the @xmath78 plane . however , because of the rather large number of parameters in the ginzburg - landau free energy , this analysis is not yet sufficient to distinguish the @xmath1 picture from competing pictures such as the @xmath404 picture and mixed representation pictures .",
    "consideration of pressure effects will allow us to do this .",
    "we will show that only @xmath1 is consistent with these experiments .",
    "the analysis in this section is an elaboration of earlier work .",
    "@xcite it is somewhat surprising that pressure experiments are so crucial for understanding the symmetry of the order parameter . under normal circumstances ,",
    "accessible pressures have only a small effect on superconducting parameters and qualitative conclusions are difficult to draw . in the present case , however , moderate pressures destroy antiferromagnetism , which restores the full hexagonal symmetry of the crystal structure . it is this singularly fortunate circumstance which makes pressure such a very powerful tool in unraveling the order parameter symmetry .    qualitatively , the facts are these .",
    "the magnetization disappears at a critical pressure of about 3 kbar .",
    "the splitting in @xmath14 also disappears at the same pressure .",
    "this shows that it is indeed the magnetization which splits the transition , as originally predicted @xcite .",
    "the coincidence of the pressures at which these events take place rules out mixed representation theories such as the a - b theory @xcite . in such theories",
    "the original splitting is due to an accidental degeneracy and is not related to the magnetization .",
    "our aim is to understand quantitatively the phases of upt@xmath0 in the entire ( @xmath405 ) space .",
    "however , in order to understand the restoration of crystal symmetry , we first focus on the ( @xmath406 ) plane , so that complications due to the gradient terms can be treated separately .",
    "the expression for the free energy density of the coupled magnetic - superconducting system is then @xmath407 , where @xmath408 @xmath409 @xmath410 we have assumed , as is conventional , that the presure dependence of fourth - order coefficients is weak and can be neglected .",
    "@xmath411 , the magnetic part of the free energy , entirely determines the behavior of the magnetization above @xmath146 .",
    "( recall that @xmath146 is the higher of the two observed transition temperatures . ) the experimental data from neutron scattering measurements of @xmath412 ( proportional to the magnetic bragg scattering at the @xmath413 point ) are sufficient to determine the parameters . at @xmath414 and @xmath415",

    "<S> the phase diagram of superconducting upt@xmath0 is explained in a ginzburg - landau theory starting from the hypothesis that the order parameter is a pseudo - spin singlet which transforms according to the @xmath1 representation of the @xmath2 point group . </S>",
    "<S> we show how to compute the positions of the phase boundaries both when the applied field is in the basal plane and when it is along the c - axis . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental phase diagrams as determined by longitudinal sound velocity data can be fit using a single set of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the crossing of the upper critical field curves for the two field directions and the apparent isotropy of the phase diagram are reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> the former is a result of the magnetic properties of upt@xmath0 and their contribution to the free energy in the superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is a consequence of an approximate particle - hole symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> finally we extend the theory to finite pressure and show that , in contrast to other models , the @xmath1 model explains the observed pressure dependence of the phase boundaries .    </S>",
