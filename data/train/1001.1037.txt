    "theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies of the raman scattering and photoluminescence in quantum dots ( qd ) are of great interest because the understanding of the scattering mechanisms is of fundamental importance for the applications .",
    "raman scattering can provide the direct information on the electronic structure , phonon spectrum , and optical properties of qds @xcite .",
    "the most part of papers is devoted to studying the _ interband _ raman scattering .",
    "however , we suppose that the _ intraband _ resonance raman scattering is also of great interest because the distance between discrete levels in qds can be done of order the optical phonon energy with help of the magnetic field . it is important to note that the optical phonon emission is known to play a dominant role in qds among the scattering mechanisms present in polar semiconductors .",
    "modern nanotechnology enables one to fabricate quantum dots of different shapes . in the past years",
    "the significant interest has been given to quantum wells and qds that are characterized by an asymmetric confining potential @xcite . in this work we present a theoretical study of the intraband resonance raman scattering of an anisotropic quantum dot subjected to a uniform magnetic field arbitrarily directed with respect to the potential symmetry axes .",
    "the applied magnetic field gives us the possibility to change the distance between levels and to adjust the energy levels of qds on the various phonon modes .",
    "the study of the different polarization for the incident and emitted radiation yields the additional information about the phonon spectrum . note that the study of intraband raman scattering lets us to obtain the simple analytic formulae for the cross - section in the case of anisotropic qds .",
    "resonance intraband raman scattering in our case can be qualitatively described in the following way : the absorption of quantum @xmath0 of the high - frequency field ( laser pump ) , emission of optical phonon @xmath1 ( photon @xmath2 ) in an intermediate state and emission of photon @xmath2 ( optical phonon @xmath1 ) in the initial state ( figure [ fig1 ] ) . in this approach ,",
    "the raman cross section is calculated from third order time - dependent perturbation theory .",

    "a direct calculation of the matrix elements of electron - photon and electron - phonon interactions is a complicate problem in our case .",

    "in conclusion , we have investigated theoretically the resonance raman scattering in the anisotropic quantum dots in the presence of arbitrarily directed magnetic field and polarization vector .",
    "raman scattering lets us to detect phonon modes in qd using the tunable laser and changing magnetic field .",

    "the cross section is equal to zero but in a small neighborhood of this point cross section has symmetrically positioned ( to the left and right ) peaks .",
