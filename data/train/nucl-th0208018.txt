    "within the framework of the qcd sum rule proposed by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov  [ [ svz ] ] , much work has been done for the meson - baryon - baryon coupling constants  [ [ rry]-[dko ] ] .",
    "sum rules have been constructed in two formulations : one is to start from the vacuum - to - vacuum matrix element of the correlation function of the interpolating fields of two baryons and one meson and the other is to start from the vacuum - to - pion matrix element of the correlation function of the interpolating fields of two baryons . in the pionnering work by reinders , rubinstein and",
    "yazaki the former approach was taken but in the following works including the one by the same authors the latter approach was employed since some difficulties seem to exist in the former approach  [ [ maltman ] ] .",
    "therefore , we discuss only the formulation with the vacuum - to - pion matrix element of the correlation function of the interpolating fields of two nucleons : @xmath8|\\pi(k)\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the interpolating field for the nucleon , @xmath10 is the pion state with momentum @xmath11 normalized as @xmath12 and the isospin is neglected for simplicity .",
    "the correlation function can be split into four dirac structures , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the coefficients of the dirac structures are functions of lorentz invariants , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and are called invariant correlation functions .",
    "reinders , rubinstein and yazaki constructed a sum rule for the pion - nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) coupling constant in the chiral limit with vanishing pion momentum from the invariant correlation function with the dirac structure @xmath13 in the leading order of the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "they showed that if the sum rule is divided by the odd - dimensional sum rule for the nucleon mass , the result is consistent with the goldberger - treiman relation with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the axial charge of the nucleon  [ [ rry ] ] .",
    "shiomi and hatsuda improved the sum rule by taking into account higher dimensional terms and @xmath21 corrections of the ope and also the continuum contributions  [ [ s&h ] ] .",
    "they showed that even after these corrections are taken into account , the goldberger - treiman relation with @xmath19 holds as long as the same continuum threshold is taken in the sum rule for the @xmath0 coupling constant and the odd - dimensional sum rule for the nucleon mass . in ref .",
    "[ [ b&k ] ] birse and krippa pointed out that in the chiral limit the vacuum - to - pion correlation function is obtained just by chirally rotating the vacuum - to - vacuum correlation function and therefore it is obvious that the ratio of the two sum rules is consistent with the goldberger - treiman relation , which is just a consequence of the chiral symmetry .",
    "then , they tried to obtain a new sum rule for the @xmath0 coupling constant which is not just a consequence of the chiral symmetry .",
    "they considered the invariant correlation function with the structure @xmath22 and obtained a sum rule by taking the limit , @xmath23 , after removing @xmath22 . in all of these works",
    "the sum rule is constructed by making an ansatz for the absorptive part of the correlation function based on the effective lagrangian with the pseudoscalar coupling scheme . in ref .",
    "[ [ klo ] ] kim , lee and oka examined how the choices of the effective lagrangian , i.e. the pseudoscalar and pseudovector coupling schemes make differences in the sum rules for all the four dirac structures .",
    "they concluded that only the invariant correlation function with the dirac structure @xmath16 , is independent of the two coupling schemes and obtained a sum rule by taking the limit , @xmath23 , after removing @xmath16 .",
    "they also claimed that their sum rule suffers from less uncertainties due to qcd parameters .    in a recent work ,",
    "we have studied in detail the physical content of the invariant correlation functions without referring to the effective lagrangian  [ [ recentkm ] ] .",
    "we have shown that the coefficients of the double poles are proportional to the @xmath0 coupling constant but that the coefficients of the single poles are not determined by the @xmath0 coupling constant . in the chiral limit",
    "the double - pole terms survive only for the dirac structures @xmath22 and @xmath16 . for these structures",
    "the single - pole terms as well as the continuum terms turn out to be ill defined in the dispersion integral .",
    "therefore , the use of naive qcd sum rules for these structures in the chiral limit is not justified .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new approach , a projrcted correlation function approach .",
    "we investigate the qcd sum rule for the @xmath0 coupling constant derived from a projrcted correlation function by applying the procedure of ref .",
    "[ [ k&m ] ] . an advantage of the new approach",
    "is that the discontinuity of the projected correlation function does not include ill - defined terms even in the chiral limit in contrast to the previous approaches .",
    "another point is that we obtain sum rules not only in the chiral limit but also with consistently including @xmath6 corrections .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we summarize the physical content of the correlation function without referring to the effective lagrangian .",
    "we introduce the projected correlation function and study its physical content in sec .",

    "iv we construct qcd sum rules for the projected correlation function and investigate the numerical results of the obtained sum rules .",

    "in this section , we summarize the physical content of the correlation function defined by .pi without referring to the effective theory  [ [ recentkm ] ] .",
    "the correlation function @xmath24 in .pi has a pole at @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , become on - shell momenta for the nucleon where @xmath29 denotes the nucleon mass .",
    "the @xmath0 coupling constant , @xmath1 , is defined through the coefficient of the pole as @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is a dirac spinor with momentum @xmath27 , spin @xmath33 and is normalized as @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is the coupling strength of the interpolating field to the nucleon .",
    "in addition to the pole singularity , @xmath24 has a branch cut singularity starting from the threshold of the pion - nucleon channel , @xmath36 , to infinity where @xmath5 is the pion mass . we restrict ourselves to the positive energy region , @xmath37 , for simplicity .    in order to classify the singularity of @xmath24",

    "is determined from that of the absorptive part by analytic continuation . from .imvf",
    "one sees that @xmath59 we found in ref.[[recentkm ] ] that in the chiral limit the double - pole terms survive only for the invariant correlation function with the dirac structures @xmath22 and @xmath16 .",
    "the coefficients of the single poles for the structures @xmath22 and @xmath16 involve the derivatives of the vertex functions with respect to @xmath17 and are therefore ill defined due to .revf .",
    "therefore , the use of naive qcd sum rules for these structures in the chiral limit is not justified .    a reasonable procedure to make an ansatz for",
    "the absorptive part of the invariant correlation function to be used in the sum rule would be first to transform it , for instance by multiplying by @xmath60 , to a form which does not include ill - defined terms .",
    "however as pionted out in refs.[[b&k],[klo ] ] one is unable to find a reasonable result using this proceedure . in this paper",
    ", we will propose a different way to construct a sum rule .",
    "we define the projected correlation function , @xmath0 vertex function and pion - nucleon t - matrix by @xmath61 the projected vertex function is related to the projected correlation function as @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath65 has poles at @xmath66 and @xmath67 but not at @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "then the absorptive part of the projected correlation function , @xmath70 , can be written as @xmath71 let us now consider the last term of .discpi .",
    "when the center - of - mass energy , @xmath44 , is above the threshold of the pion - nucleon channel , @xmath49 , but below that of the next channel , @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are on - shell momenta for the nucleon and the pion , respectively , and @xmath74 is defined by @xmath75 since @xmath76 as @xmath77 , @xmath78 behaves in the vicinity of the pion - nucleon threshold as @xmath79 which is in contrast to .imvf .",
    "here we should discuss the behaviour of @xmath80 in the chiral limit with @xmath81 : we obtain @xmath82 the coefficient of the single pole term vanishes since @xmath83 behave as @xmath84 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "the last term behaves as @xmath88 since @xmath89 behaves as @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the second term and third term on the right - hand side of .impi are well defined in the dispersion integral .",
    "for the sake of completeness we first summarize the derivation of the borel sum rule for the projected correlation function .",

    "we calculate the wilson coefficients of the short - distance expansion in two steps : we perform the light - cone expansion of the correlation function first and the short - distance expansion of the light - cone operators second .",

    "the coupling constant changes almost 40% from @xmath157=1  gev@xmath165 to 2  gev@xmath165 .",
    "thus , the second sum rule does not satisfy the borel stability .",
    "in contrast the first sum rule has a very stable plateau .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the first sum rule is the best for extracting the @xmath0 coupling constant . comparing the solid line in fig .  4 and in fig .",
    "1 we find the @xmath6 correction for the coupling constant in the first sum rule is about 5% .    finally , we disscuss the errors due to uncertainties of the parameters . we found that the coupling constant is most sensitive to the quark condensate , typically quoted error , @xmath171 , changes @xmath1 by @xmath172 . the errors of @xmath173 are expected to be irrelevant since the contribution from the gluon condensate is well known to be small in the nucleon sum rule .",
    "we next study the errors due to @xmath174 and @xmath115 .",
    "the parameter , @xmath174 , lies in the range between @xmath175 and @xmath176 according to ref .",
    "[ [ m02 ] ] .",
    "the numerical estimation , @xmath177 , was performed by novikov et al . through the qcd sum rules in ref .",
    "[ [ novikov ] ] .",
    "the errors due to uncertainty of @xmath174 and @xmath115 turn out to be less than 1% and 5% , respectively .",
    "we expect that the uncertainty of @xmath118 is also unimportant , since from .sreven its contribution is too small .",
    "we finally investigate the errors due to the uncertainties of the effective continuum thresholds . from the borel stability analysis we determined the errors of the effective continuum thresholds as @xmath178",
    "gev and @xmath179  gev.these errors change @xmath1 by @xmath180 and @xmath181 , respectively .",
    "taking account of all these uncertainties , we conclude @xmath182 which is in reasonable agreement with the emprical value .    a comment for the choice of @xmath115 is in order here .",
    "birse and krippa estimated the uncertainty of @xmath115 as @xmath183 and took @xmath184 in the calculation of @xmath1  [ [ b&k ] ] .",
    "if we take @xmath184 , from .l_eq we obtain @xmath185 thus the prediction of our sum rule does not become bad even if we take @xmath115 much larger than the typical value @xmath186 .",
    "we have proposed a new approach in order to construct qcd sum rules for the @xmath0 coupling constant , @xmath1 , starting from the vacuum - to - pion correlation function of the interpolating fields of two nucleons and taking its matrix element with respect to nucleon spinors .",
    "this is based on the detailed study of the physical content of the correlation function without referring to the effective lagrangian . in the chiral limit",
    "either the double - pole term vanishes or the single - pole term as well as the continuum term is not separately well defined under the dispersion integral in previous approaches using invariant correlation functions , while the double - pole term survives but the single - pole term and the continuum term give well - defined contributions in our new approach with projected correlation functions . in this respect",
    "the use of the projected correlation function seems advantageous .",
    "another advantage of our approach is that unwanted pole contribution is projected out .    calculating the wilson coefficients of the ope of the correlation function up to @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the borel mass and the pion mass ,",
    "respectively , we have constructed new qcd sum rules for the @xmath0 coupling constant from the projected correlation function with consistently including @xmath6 corrections . since there are even and odd terms both for the vacuum - to - pion and the vacuum - to - vacuum sum rules , by dividing former by the latter in order to eliminate the coupling strength of the interpolating field to the nucleon we have derived four sum rules .",
    "we examined if the pole contribution dominates the continuum contribution , if @xmath6 correction is reasonably small and if the result is stable in the sense of borel stability .",
    "we concluded that among four sum rules the one obtained by dividing the even vacuum - to - pion sum rule by the even vacuum - to - vacuum sum rule is most pertinent . after roughly estimating errors we obtaind , @xmath7 , as a result of this sum rule , which is in reasonable agreement with the empirical value . .",
    "we also found that the @xmath6 correction is about 5% .",
    "the present approach can be used for other interesting applications .",
    "first of all , if we keep the pion momentum finite in the present formalism , we will obtain the information on the @xmath187 form factors .",
    "it is also possible to calculate not only the coupling constants of meson and two same baryons like @xmath188 and @xmath189 but also the coupling constants of meson and two different baryons like @xmath190 and @xmath191 without taking the flavor su(3 ) limit .",
