    "galaxies observed with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the hubble space telescope become increasingly clumpy and irregular beyond redshift @xmath8 , partly because star - forming regions get intrinsically more massive at higher redshifts , partly because of bandshifting of uv - bright regions into the optical bands , and partly because of an increased importance of interactions in the young universe ( e.g. , abraham et al .",

    "the most irregular systems are clump - clusters , which are oval collections of bright clumps , and chain galaxies ( cowie , hu , & songaila 1995 ) , which are linear alignments of bright clumps .",
    "the distribution of the ratio of axes among clump cluster and chain galaxies suggests that the chains are edge - on clump - clusters ( elmegreen , elmegreen & hirst 2004 ; elmegreen & elmegreen 2005 ) .",

    "clump - clusters and chains that avoid destructive mergers presumably evolve into modern disk galaxies .",
    "we would like to understand the time sequence for their evolution and the processes that convert such irregular systems into smooth disks with bulges and exponential profiles .",
    "numerical simulations of gas - rich , turbulent disks resembling clump clusters suggest that clumps form by gravitational instabilities and have the local jeans mass ( bournaud , elmegreen & elmegreen 2007 ) , which can exceed @xmath2 at the high level of turbulence that is observed ( frster schreiber et al .",
    "2006 ; genzel et al .",
    "if the clumps are massive enough , they interact gravitationally , causing a redistribution of angular momentum outward and an accretion of clump and other disk mass inward .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to look for young bulges in clump cluster and chain galaxies , and to try to understand how these galaxies fit into an evolutionary sequence of disk systems . to do this , we measure and model the magnitudes of all the prominent clumps in the clump - cluster , chain , and spiral galaxies in the udf .",
    "the models then give the clump ages , the star formation decay times in each clump , the extinctions , and the masses .",
    "section [ sect : data ] describes the data and photometry , section [ sect : morph ] considers the morphologies of bulges in clump cluster and chain galaxies , section [ sect : color ] discusses the colors and magnitudes of the galaxies , bulges and clumps , section [ sect : models ] presents models for intrinsic properties of the bulges and clumps , and section [ sect : disc ] discusses the results .",
    "a conclusion is in section [ sect : conc ] .",
    "the definition of a bulge is subjective for highly irregular galaxies like chains and clump clusters .",
    "this contrasts to the case for spiral galaxies at high redshift , which have clear bulges that are centralized and relatively red .",
    "most of the irregular galaxies considered here either have nothing that could be identified as a bulge , even in near infrared camera multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) images where bulges should be seen , or they have one clump that is slightly redder , brighter , or more centrally positioned than the others and could conceivably be a young bulge .",
    "we can not place a quantitative measure on what is considered to be a bulge because then our mass and age results would reflect this initial selection .",
    "instead we view the images and select the clump that is reddest , however red that is , or brightest , and then examine the age and mass differences compared to the other clumps .",
    "nicmos is essential for this because by definition , chain and clump cluster galaxies have no centralized bulges in optical images  if they did , they would be classified as spirals .",
    "if there are no particularly red clumps , or no particularly bright centralized clumps , i.e. , if all of the clumps look about the same in both optical and nicmos bands , and none are particularly concentrated toward the center , then we conclude that there is no `` bulge - like clump '' ( blc ) in that galaxy .",
    "in fact , we find that either clump cluster and chain galaxies have no blcs , or , if they do , then those blcs are generally more similar to the other clumps in the same galaxies than are the bulges in spiral galaxies compared to their clumps . this comparison is made on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis to minimize uncertainties in redshift and metallicity , which should be more uniform within a galaxy than between galaxies .",
    "we conclude below that the bulges in clump clusters and chains are morphologically younger than the bulges in spirals .",
    "this agrees with our direct age measurements in many cases , but because galaxy formation may be spread out somewhat over redshift , and because some spiral bulges may form late while some clump cluster galaxies may form relatively early , there is no obvious one - to - one correspondence between bulge age and bulge morphology at the redshifts of interest here . with our definition of blcs , there is at most one blc per chain or clump cluster galaxy , and this is the most massive of the red clumps seen in the nicmos images .",
    "we use acs images for the whole udf field and nicmos images in the portion of the udf covered by that instrument .",
    "the nicmos images are three times poorer resolution than the acs images , but nicmos allows us to assess whether a galaxy contains an evolved bulge , which should be red in restframe colors and prominent in nicmos .",
    "while all of the spiral galaxies contain an obvious central bulge in the acs image ( this defines them as spiral types ) , none of the clump - clusters and chain galaxies do .",
    "still , we find blcs in nicmos for one - third of the well - resolved chains and one - half of the well - resolved clump clusters . in most cases ,",
    "these blcs are also seen as clumps in the acs images , although the overall structures of these galaxies are irregular ( e.g. , about 20% of the blcs in each irregular type are significantly offset from the center ) , and the blcs are bluer in clump clusters and chains ( compared to the rest of the galaxy ) than are the bulges in spirals .",
    "we also find prominent nicmos emission from inner red disks that are not likely to be bulges in the usual sense ; we call this diffuse red emission .",
    "we also use the spitzer irac images that are available for a portion of the udf field .",
    "the ab magnitudes were determined for all of the clumps , blcs , and bulges studied here using the four acs passbands , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath9 , and @xmath15 , and the two nicmos passbands , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "magnitudes were determined for all clumps , blcs , and bulges by defining boxes around the objects using the iraf task @xmath18 .",
    "their clump boundaries are defined at a level about 10@xmath19 above the noise .",
    "zeropoint conversions for each filter are available through the online handbooks .",
    "magnitude measurement errors are estimated to be about 0.1 mag .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 magnitudes of the bulges and diffuse inner concentrations in 47 clump clusters , 27 chains , and 131 spiral galaxies were measured from the nicmos images , and the bviz magnitudes of the bulges were measured for the same regions using the acs images that are degraded to the resolution of nicmos .",
    "the bviz magnitudes of all the prominent clumps , blcs , and bulges in 184 clump clusters , 112 chains , and 118 spiral galaxies were also measured from the acs images .",
    "there are 898 , 406 , and 845 such objects in the three galaxy types , respectively .",
    "boxes rather than circles were used to define magnitudes because the clumps are small and pixelated ; a typical clump has a diameter of 3 to 5 pixels .",
    "no background was subtracted because the surrounding fields are irregular and because the clumps are much brighter than the background ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : bulge - jennafig1copy ] - [ fig : bulge - jennafig4b-6108 ] , discussed below ) .",
    "the sky value in each image is essentially zero counts .",
    "examples of boxes used for clump measurements are shown in figure [ fig : udf2510,1666,3372linear ] . in order from left to right , the galaxies in figure [ fig : udf2510,1666,3372linear ] correspond to the color images in figure [ fig : bulge - jennafig4b-6108 ] ( top right ) , and figure [ fig : bulge - jennafig1copy ] ( lower left and lower right , resp . ) .",
    "the images in figure [ fig : udf2510,1666,3372linear ] are in the @xmath9 band and have a grayscale with a linear stretch . for clump clusters ,",
    "the clumps are typically more than 3 times brighter than the surrounding field in @xmath9 band . for spirals and chains ,",
    "the clumps are 2 to 4 times brighter than the surrounding field in @xmath9 band .",
    "these contrasts are larger at shorter wavelengths",
    ". the uncertainty in a given clump brightness can be as much as a factor of two depending on the box size . because the same box is used for each passband , the clump color is much less variable than the clump magnitude .",
    "colors typically vary by less than 0.05 mag for different box placements or sizes .",
    "bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) model spectra were used to determine model colors for comparison with the colors of the clumps , blcs , and bulges .",
    "problems with tp - agb stars ( e.g. , maraston 2005 ) affect mostly the restframe passbands beyond r , which are not generally included in our acs measurements for typical redshifts .",
    "such stars could contribute to the interpretation of nicmos observations of bulges / blcs for @xmath22 , but comparisons between acs+nicmos fits at low angular resolution and acs - only fits at high resolution ( shown in figs . [",
    "fig : nicmos_bulgeandclumps_mass_vs_z_alltypes ] -[fig : nicmos_bulgeandclumps_ext_vs_z_alltypes ] ) do not show significant trends , suggesting that tp - agb contamination is less important than other uncertainties , such as that resulting from low nicmos resolution .",
    "for the models , we considered a decaying star formation history with separate start times and decay rates for each clump , intervening cosmological hydrogen absorption ( madau 1995 ) , and internal dust absorption . a @xmath23cdm cosmology was assumed ( spergel et al .",
    "photometric redshifts were determined by elmegreen et al .",
    "( 2007a ) , using the method of coe et al .",
    "they are accurate to @xmath24 .",
    "the galaxies identified in the hubble acs images were located in the spitzer images using the online cutout feature . if a galaxy showed up in the irac images , its integrated light was measured in a 5x5 pixel box ; if it was significantly larger or smaller than this , boxes were drawn for photometry at the appropriate size .",
    "zeropoints from the online handbook were used for the conversion of irac counts into magnitudes for comparison with the acs photometry .",
    "approximately half of the sample was contaminated in the irac images due to blending with nearby neighbors because of the poor resolution .",
    "these cases were not considered .",
    "the spitzer magnitudes were not used for any derived clump or bulge properties because these subcomponents were unresolved .",
    "figures [ fig : bulge - jennafig1copy]-[fig : bulge - jennafig4b-6108 ] show examples of chains , clump clusters , and spirals having various acs and nicmos blc or bulge types .",

    "the nicmos online catalog gives integrated bvizjh magnitudes for each galaxy .",
    "these were used in the top panels of figure [ fig : nicmos_i - zvszwithclumps ] to plot ( i@xmath25-z@xmath26 ) versus redshift for whole clump cluster , chain , and spiral galaxies .",

    "the pluses represent centralized bulges or blcs and the circles are significantly off - center blcs .",
    "the small blue dots in the middle row of panels are nicmos observations of bright central regions that are diffuse like a disk , and not clumpy like a bulge ( these are considered to be non - bulge galaxies , along with other cases where there are neither diffuse nor clumpy bright nicmos features ) .",
    "blue symbols in this middle row ( pluses , circles , dots ) use the online acs images that are blurred by a factor of 3 to match the nicmos resolution .",
    "the red crosses in the middle row of panels are the colors for the red clumps in the acs images , presumed to be blcs because they are at the same positions as the nicmos blcs ; they were measured with the full resolution of the acs whenever they could be detected there .",

    "each panel in figure [ fig : nicmos_i - zvszwithclumps ] has a peak near @xmath27 , where i@xmath25 and z@xmath26 correspond to restframe wavelengths of 336 nm and 370 nm .",
    "these approximately straddle the balmer jump at @xmath28 nm , so this peak is from that jump .",
    "evidently the bulge / blc population is young enough to have a balmer jump , but not as young as the clumps , which are typically bluer than the bulges / blcs and the whole galaxies .",
    "this relative clump blueness is also evident from the color images , although some bright central regions , presumably bulges , are as blue as the clumps in the rest of those galaxies .",
    "comparison with the evolutionary models in conselice ( 2008 ) shows that the bulges and blcs have the same @xmath29 colors as integrated scd galaxies .",
    "we compared our udf bulges to those measured in the hubble deep fields north and south by ellis , abraham , & dickinson ( 2001 ) out to @xmath30 .",
    "they showed that bulges in early and late type spirals are significantly bluer than the centers of elliptical and s0 galaxies at a given redshift , as measured by their v@xmath31-i@xmath32 colors .",
    "ellis et al . also included nicmos measurements of their galaxy centers and integrated galaxies . in order to compare our results for bulges in udf clump cluster and chain galaxies with their hdf measurements",

    "we selected their non - peculiar , non - blended galaxies , which they classified automatically based on central concentration and asymmetry as well as visually . at redshifts out to @xmath30 , which encompasses the bulk of the ellis et al .",
    "sample , our clumpy galaxy bulge - like objects have about the same or slightly bluer colors as their hdf intermediate type spiral bulges .",
    "the integrated galaxy colors are also correspondingly slightly bluer for the clumpy galaxies than for the hdf elliptical and spiral galaxies .",
    "the apparent @xmath15 magnitudes for the same galaxies , bulges or blcs , and clumps are shown versus redshift in figure [ fig : nicmos_appmag_vs_z ] , using the same symbol notation .",
    "a fixed magnitude of 26 is shown in each panel as a dotted red line to facilitate comparisons ; the clumps are typically 1 to 2 magnitudes fainter than the bulges / blcs , which are 2 to 3 magnitudes fainter than the whole galaxies . at high redshift ,",
    "the bulges in spirals are somewhat brighter in @xmath15 than the blcs in clump clusters and chains ( the same is true for h band , discussed below ) .    in the top right panel of figure [ fig : nicmos_appmag_vs_z ] ,",
    "the distance modulus is plotted as a curve with its scale on the right .",
    "the absolute magnitude is equal to the difference between the apparent magnitude of the plotted point and the distance modulus at the same redshift .",
    "absolute magnitudes of @xmath34 mag and @xmath35 mag are indicated by dotted lines in the lower two rows .",
    "these values bracket the range of absolute magnitudes for the brightest blcs and clumps in clump clusters and chains .",
    "bulge / blc @xmath15 magnitudes increase slightly with redshift , following the green dashed lines .",
    "this is also observed in h - band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nicmos_appmagh_vs_z ] below ) . the bulge / blc masses are relatively constant with @xmath36 ( sect .",
    "[ sect : results ] ) , so the change in @xmath15 is probably a bandshifting effect ; i.e. , the restframe blue colors of the bulges / blcs are fainter than the restframe red colors .",
    "the distribution of clumps in the bottom row of figure [ fig : nicmos_appmag_vs_z ] is more horizontal ; i.e. , the apparent magnitude is about constant with redshift for clumps .",
    "this is partly a selection effect because star - forming objects as faint as those seen locally can not be observed at higher redshifts .",
    "it is also partly a bandshifting effect : typical clump masses and ages are about constant with redshift , so the brightening in the observed @xmath15 band is the result of an increasing shift of blue emission from intense star formation into this filter with higher redshift .",
    "this is opposite to the shift for bulges / blcs because of the intrinsic color difference .",
    "restframe apparent magnitudes , @xmath13 , were determined for each galaxy , bulge , blc , and clump by interpolation between the four acs passbands and plotted in the same way as in figure [ fig : nicmos_appmag_vs_z ] .",
    "the restframe distributions were very similar to the observer - frame distributions in figure [ fig : nicmos_appmag_vs_z ] , so the results are not shown here .",
    "the similarity arises because the magnitude range for all the points ( from the diverse galaxy brightnesses ) is much larger than the magnitude range for any one galaxy among the different passbands .",
    "the restframe absolute magnitudes , @xmath37 , are shown in figure [ fig : nicmos_absmag_vs_z ] using the same symbol notation as in figure [ fig : nicmos_appmag_vs_z ] .",
    "the constant value of @xmath38 mag is drawn for comparison ; this value is typically considered to be a dividing point between local dwarf and spiral galaxies .",
    "evidently , most clumps at intermediate to high redshifts are brighter than local dwarf galaxies . for the determination of restframe magnitudes ,",
    "the high redshift points have no acs observations for interpolation , so the acs @xmath15 absolute magnitude is plotted instead , as an estimate .",
    "figure [ fig : nicmos_j - hvsz ] shows nicmos j - h colors versus redshift for whole galaxies ( top ) and bulges or blcs ( bottom ) using the nicmos catalog in the first case and iraf measurements on the nicmos images in the second case .",
    "infrared colors are not available for the clumps because they are usually not present in nicmos images or they are not resolved by nicmos .",
    "the j - h colors straddle the balmer jump at a redshift of 2.6 but no features are observed in the figure there .",
    "figure [ fig : nicmos_appmagh_vs_z ] shows the nicmos apparent h - band magnitudes versus redshift for whole galaxies ( top ) and bulges ( middle ) . a fiducial magnitude of 26 is shown as a dotted red line to aid comparisons .",
    "the apparent magnitudes of the bulges and blcs tend to increase with redshift parallel to the dashed line of constant absolute magnitude ; this is probably a result of bandshifting because the bulge / blc masses do not vary like this ( sect .",
    "[ sect : results ] ) and because the ir colors , @xmath29 , @xmath39 , etc .",
    ", are positive by several tenths each .",
    "thus higher redshifts show more restframe blue light in h - band , and this is fainter than the restframe red light for the bulges .",
    "a similar increase in @xmath15 magnitude with redshift was seen in figure [ fig : nicmos_appmag_vs_z ] .",
    "figure [ fig : nicmos_appmagh_vs_z ] indicates that spiral bulges at high redshift are @xmath40 mag brighter than the blcs in clump cluster and chain galaxies at high redshift , just as whole spiral galaxies are brighter in h - band than the others .",
    "the relative brightness of spiral bulges ( also in @xmath15 band , shown above ) is explained in section [ sect : results ] to be a result of their larger bulge masses compared to clump cluster and chain blc masses .",
    "the bottom row in figure [ fig : nicmos_appmagh_vs_z ] shows the differences between the bulge / blc and the galaxy h - band magnitudes .",
    "the average values of these differences are shown by dotted red lines .",
    "for clump clusters , chains , and spirals , the average magnitude differences are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , respectively . to the extent that the h band is a reasonable tracer of stellar mass , these magnitude differences correspond to a relative bulge / blc mass compared to the galaxy mass of @xmath44 .",
    "figure [ fig : nicmos_spitzer ] shows the ( @xmath45 ) colors as a function of redshift for the clump cluster and chain galaxies , sorted by bulge type as before , and also for spiral galaxies in the udf for comparison .",
    "there is no clear difference among the different types of galaxies , although most of the galaxies with bulges or blcs are redder than non - bulge galaxies .",
    "the photometric colors were compared with colors obtained from redshifted low - resolution spectral templates of stellar populations with a chabrier initial mass function , as tabulated by bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) .",
    "we confined our detailed study to the bruzual & charlot models with metallicities of 0.008 ( equal to 0.4 solar ) because metallicities for these types of objects are not commonly observed yet and this level of metallicity seems reasonable for partially developed galaxies .",
    "we note that the metallicity determined for the clump cluster galaxy udf  6462 from high resolution spectral observations is @xmath46 solar on average , and about 20% higher than this in a reddish object that resembles a bulge ( bournaud et al .",
    "the value we choose is comparable to this measurement .",
    "results for lower metallicities of 0.004 and 0.0004 will be discussed in section [ sect : results ] .",
    "corrections to the model spectra were made to account for intervening hydrogen absorption , taking the lyman series up to order 20 and including continuum ( madau 1995 ) , and for dust in the high redshift galaxy .",
    "photometric redshifts are from elmegreen et al .",
    "( 2007a ) .    the procedure for fitting the stellar population was as follows",
    "( see also elmegreen & elmegreen 2005 ) .",
    "we considered three parameters for each clump and bulge / blc fit : the starting time of star formation in that clump or bulge / blc ( i.e. , the `` age , '' @xmath47 , of the region in the galaxy s restframe ) , the exponential decay rate of star formation in that region ( @xmath48 ) , and the extinction in that region .",
    "the possible starting times ranged from zero in the galaxy s restframe , back to the relative time corresponding to a redshift of @xmath49 .",
    "the decay times were @xmath50 and @xmath51 years . with these two parameters , the star formation history in the clump under consideration",
    "was assumed to begin at a time in the past equal to the `` age '' and then decay exponentially over time with a timescale @xmath48 until the current restframe time of the galaxy .",
    "dust absorption was included as a third parameter of the fit using the wavelength dependence in calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with the short - wavelength modification in leitherer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and using discrete multiples of @xmath52 times the redshift dependence for galaxy intrinsic @xmath53 in rowan - robinson ( 2003 ) .",
    "these multiples were @xmath54 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 times the rowan - robinson extinctions for the redshift of each galaxy . for each fit of these three parameters , there are 4 passbands and 3 colors from the acs observations , and in the case of bulges or blcs , there are two more colors from nicmos . thus the fits are mathematically well determined , although the uncertainties can be large for individual values , particularly for age and extinction .",
    "we discuss the fit uncertainties for clump masses and ages in section [ sect : results ] . for clumps or bulges / blcs with acs observations ,",
    "4 passbands were fit to the models .",
    "for bulges / blcs with nicmos observations in @xmath20 and @xmath21 bands , six passbands were fit to the models , two from nicmos and four more from the @xmath55 blurred acs images that match the resolution of nicmos .",
    "we note that the colors of these galaxies were also used to determine photometric redshifts , and along with the redshifts , galactic spectral types @xmath56 ( elmegreen 2007a ) .",
    "the colors used for redshifts are for whole galaxies and not for clumps , while the new fits given here are for the clump colors alone .",
    "thus the same observations are not used for both redshift and clump properties , and the clump 3-parameter fits , for @xmath57 , are not degenerate with the fit for redshift .",
    "for example , we find young clumps in spirals with a wide range of redshifts , even though spirals tend to have low @xmath56 ( old average ages ) at low redshift ( elmegreen 2007a ) .",
    "for each age @xmath47 and decay time @xmath48 , we determined the model spectrum of the stellar population by integrating over the product of the time - dependent spectra from tables in bruzual & charlot and the time - dependent star formation rate , @xmath58/\\tau\\right)dt$ ] , for time @xmath59 in the range @xmath60 .",
    "these tables are normalized to 1 @xmath61 of stars for each spectrum , so we also integrated over the product of the star formation rate and the time - dependent remaining stellar mass ( the remaining stellar mass is what remains from the original 1 @xmath61 after stellar evolution for the time @xmath62 ) .",
    "we then corrected the integrated model for intrinsic dust absorption , assuming one of the absorption multipliers , @xmath52 , redshifted the corrected spectrum to the redshift of the galaxy , and corrected it again for intervening hydrogen absorption lines .",
    "this redshifted population spectrum was then multiplied by the normalized , hst filter / throughput functions ( downloaded from the hst website ) to get the model absolute magnitudes per unit solar mass of stars formed , and from these , the model colors for the assumed @xmath57 combination .",
    "the absolute ab magnitude in @xmath9 band was converted to an apparent magnitude using the distance modulus at the galaxy redshift for a @xmath23cdm cosmology ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ; carroll , press , & turner 1992 ) , and the ratio of the observed apparent flux to the model apparent flux in the @xmath9 band was multiplied by the model mass to get the total stellar mass for that @xmath57 combination .    to determine how well each @xmath57 combination fits the observed clump or bulge / blc ,",
    "the rms differences between the model colors and the observed colors were determined for each @xmath63 at a particular @xmath52 .",

    "a higher value of extinction leads to a fit with a lower value of age ( fig .",

    "these objects also emit at relatively long restframe optical wavelengths , observed here as redshifted emission in the nicmos and irac bands . because the @xmath39 and @xmath98 colors are fairly uniform among clump clusters and chains , and also comparable to the colors of spirals ( figs .",
    "[ fig : nicmos_j - hvsz ] and [ fig : nicmos_spitzer ] ) , most clump clusters and chains can not be random assemblies of young star formation clumps or young separate galaxies ; they are whole galaxies with relatively old populations of stars and superposed star formation regions .",

    "considering that some spirals may be too red to see in the acs , we can only say that the clumpy types appear to dominate the spirals by up to a factor of @xmath40 in number density .",
    "still , clump clusters and chains can be observed out to @xmath100 in the acs , which is the expected limit from bandshifting .",

    "it follows that clump clusters and chains appear to represent an early phase of disk formation that a high fraction of spirals go through .",
    "our results in section [ sect : results ] confirm this : the ratio of individual clump mass to galaxy mass is @xmath40% for clump clusters and chains .",

    "moreover , only @xmath110% of the chains and @xmath64% of the clump clusters have obvious blcs on infrared images .",

    "this supports a model where the disk forms by the dissolution of clumps ( elmegreen et al .",

    "they probably contain unresolved subclusters . in local spirals ,",

    "using half the corresponding wavelength , @xmath117 as a measure of clump radius , and @xmath118 as a measure of clump mass , we see that the scale up in mass by a factor @xmath119 and the scale up in size by a factor of @xmath120 correspond to an increase in @xmath121 by @xmath122 and an increase in @xmath123 by @xmath124 .",
