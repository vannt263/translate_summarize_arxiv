    "homogeneous markov processes with jumps .",
    "these processes , referred to as @xmath0 below , can be viewed as ornstein  uhlenbeck processes satisfying @xmath1 driven by a compound poisson process @xmath2 .",
    "the ruin time , @xmath3 , is defined as the time to passage below @xmath4 for an initial state @xmath5 .",
    "the passage below @xmath4 can be a result of a downward jump , and in some cases a continuous passage through @xmath4 is is also possible .",
    "the main results give asymptotic descriptions of @xmath6 , when @xmath7 in the limits @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , the limit distribution of the undershoot in case of passage by jump is determined for @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "it will be assumed that the driving compound poisson process has a special jump structure .",
    "both the downward and upward jumps are assumed to have a density ( not the same ) that is a linear  not necessarily convex  combination of exponential densities    it is important to distinguish between two different scenarios : whether the drift @xmath11 is positive , hence @xmath0 is transient , or the drift is negative , in which case the process @xmath0 is recurrent . in the negative drift case",
    "the probability @xmath6 ( with @xmath3 denoting the time of passage ) of ever crossing below @xmath4 when starting at @xmath12 is always 1 .",
    "when the drift @xmath11 is positive we have that @xmath13 , and this probability decreases when either @xmath8 or @xmath9",
    ".    the distribution of the passage time ( and by that also the ruin probability ) is determined through the laplace transform .",
    "this is found by exploiting certain stopped martingales derived from using bounded partial eigenfunctions for the infinitesimal generator for @xmath0 .",
    "an explicit expression for the laplace transform is determined in @xcite . here",
    "the partial eigenfunctions are found as linear combinations of functions given by contour integrals in the complex plane .",
    "also the laplace transform ends up being a linear combination of these integrals .",
    "it is the resulting laplace transform from @xcite that we shall investigate in this paper .    in the present paper the asymptotics of @xmath6",
    "is explored in both of the situations @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this becomes a question about finding the asymptotics for the complex contour integrals mentioned above .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath9 problem is the far most complicated because the dependence of @xmath4 in the construction of the partial eigenfunctions is more involved .",
    "nevertheless , the need of exploring the asymptotic behaviour of the integrals is similar .",
    "when @xmath8 we see that @xmath6 decreases exponentially ( adjusted by some specified power function ) with the exponential parameter from the leading exponential part of the downward jumps .",
    "the technique of using partial eigenfunctions for the infinitesimal generator has appeared before .",
    "paulsen and gjessing , @xcite , considers a model like the present , but in the more general ( and also different ) setup @xmath14 here both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are compound poisson processes of the form @xmath17 . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that a partial eigenfunction for the corresponding infinitesimal generator for ( [ stormodel ] ) will lead to the ruin probability and also the laplace transform for the ruin time .",
    "@xcite shows in a model without @xmath18 and @xmath16 the existence of this partial eigenfunction under some smoothness assumptions about the jump distributions in @xmath15 .",
    "this result is extended to weaker assumptions in @xcite .    in the case of @xmath19 , without @xmath16 , and assuming exponential negative jump and no positive jumps , an explicit formula for the laplace transform is determined in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the exponential decrease in @xmath6 is derived in the @xmath8 asymptotic situation for some fixed @xmath20 . for the case of exponential negative jumps",
    "also see asmussen @xcite , chapter vii .    in the present paper",
    "the jump distributions are assumed to be light tailed .",
    "the existing literature does not contain very explicit results for the asymptotic ruin probability with that kind of jump distributions . in @xcite and",
    "@xcite it is proved in the @xmath21 case with @xmath22<\\infty\\}$ ] that for any @xmath23 @xmath24 in the case of heavy tailed jump distributions there are more explicit results for the asymptotic behaviour of the ruin probability . in @xcite results are obtained for the asymptotics of the finite horizon ruin probability @xmath25 in a fairly general model with @xmath21 and subexpontial jump distributions .",
    "similar results are reached in @xcite in the infinite horizon case . here",
    "the jumps belong to a less general class of heavy tailed distributions .    in @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite the following model class of certain markov modulated lvy processes @xmath26 is studied . the same partial eigenfunction technique is applied , and it is showed that the partial eigenfunctions ( and thereby also the ruin probabilities ) can be expressed as a linear combination of exponential functions ( evaluated in the starting point @xmath12 ) . hence , the asymptotic behaviour of the probability when @xmath8 reduces to finding the exponential function with the slowest decrease . since the model is additive , the level @xmath4 that is to be crossed at the time of ruin , enters into the setup symmetric to @xmath12 .",
    "hence , the asymptotics when @xmath9 are just as easy to derive . in novikov et .",
    "al , @xcite , the laplace transform is determined for a shot  noise model with exponentially distributed downward jumps ( and no positive jumps allowed ) for a process with negative drift .",
    "the laplace transform was also derived in the case of uniformly distributed downward jumps . in @xcite",
    "these results are extended to a more general driving lvy process instead of a compound poisson process . in @xcite some asymptotic results for the distribution of @xmath3 are carried out . here the limit distribution of @xmath3 is expressed when @xmath9 for some fixed starting point @xmath12 and negative drift .",
