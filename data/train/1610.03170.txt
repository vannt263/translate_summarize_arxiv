    "the problem of dissociation of bound states in a hot qcd medium is of great importance in heavy ion collisions as it provides evidence for the creation of the quark - gluon plasma there  @xcite .",
    "matsui and satz  @xcite , proposed @xmath0 suppression caused by the debye screening by the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) as an important signature to reaffirm its formation in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the physical understanding of the quarkonium dissociation within a deconfined medium has undergone some definite refinements in the last couple of years  @xcite . as the heavy quark and anti - quark in a quarkonia state",
    "are bound together by almost static ( off - shell ) gluons , therefore , the issue of their dissociation boils down to how the gluon self - energy behaves at high temperatures .",
    "it has been noticed that the gluon self - energy has both real and imaginary parts  @xcite .",
    "note that the real part lead to the debye screening , while the imaginary part leads to landau damping and give rise the thermal width to the quarkonia .",
    "the fate of quarkonia , at zero temperature can be understood in terms of non - relativistic potential models ( as the velocity of the quarks in the bound state is small , @xmath1 ) @xcite using the cornell potential @xcite .",
    "further , the physics of the fate of a given quarkonium state in the qgp medium , is encoded in its spectral function   @xcite .",
    "therefore , following the temperature behavior of the spectral function , theoretical insight to the quarkonium properties at finite temperature can be made .",
    "there are mainly two lines of theoretical approaches to determine quarkonium spectral functions , _ viz .",
    "_ , the potential models  @xcite which have been widely used to study quarkonia states ( their applicability at finite temperature is still under scrutiny ) , and the lattice qcd studies  @xcite which provides the reliable way to determine spectral functions , but the results suffer from discretization effects and statistical errors , and thus are still inconclusive .",
    "these two approaches show poor matching as far as their predictions are concerned .",
    "none of these two approaches leads towards a complete framework to study the properties of quarkonia states at finite temperature .",
    "however , some degree of qualitative agreement had still been achieved for the s - wave correlaters .",
    "in contrast , the finding was somehow ambiguous for the p - wave correlaters . additionally , the temperature dependence of the potential model was even qualitatively different from the lattice one .",
    "refinement in the computations of the spectral functions have recently been done ( including the zero modes both in the s- and p - channels )   @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that , these contributions cure most of the previously observed discrepancies with lattice calculations .",
    "this supports the fact that the employment of potential models at finite temperature can serve as an important tool to complement lattice studies .",
    "the potential model can actually be derived directly from qcd as an effective field theory ( potential non - relativistic qcd - pnrqcd ) by integrating out modes above the scales @xmath2 and then @xmath3 , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that the potential models have been served as useful approach while exploring the physics of heavy quarkonia since the discovery of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it indeed provides a useful way to examine quarkonium binding energies , quarkonium wave functions , reaction rates , transition rates and decay widths .",
    "it further allows the extrapolation to the region of high temperatures by expressing screening effects reflecting on the temperature dependence of the potential .",
    "the effects of dynamics of quarks on the stability of quarkonia can be studied by using potential models extracted from thermodynamic quantities that are computed in full qcd . at high temperatures , the deconfined phase of qcd exhibits screening of static color - electric fields  @xcite ; it is , therefore , expected that the screening will lead to the dissociation of quarkonium states .",
    "after the success at zero temperature while predicting hadronic mass spectra , potential model descriptions have also been applied to understand quarkonium properties at finite temperature .",
    "note that , the production of @xmath0 and @xmath4 mesons in hadronic reactions occurs in part via the production of higher excited @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) states and their decay into respective ground state . since the lifetime of different quarkonium state is much larger than the typical life - time of the medium produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions ; their decay occur almost completely outside the produced medium  @xcite .",
    "this is crucial due to the fact that the produced medium can be probed not only by the ground state quarkonium but also by different excited quarkonium states . since",
    ", different quarkonia states have different sizes and binding energies , hence , one expects that higher excited states will dissolve at smaller temperature as compared to the smaller and more tightly bound ground state .",
    "these facts may lead to a sequential suppression pattern in @xmath0 and @xmath4 yield in nucleus - nucleus collision as the function of the energy density .",
    "the potential model in this context could be helpful in predicting for the binding energies of various quarkonia states by setting up and solving appropriate schrdinger equation in the hot qcd medium .",
    "the first step towards this is to model an appropriate medium dependent interquark interaction potential at finite temperature .",
    "the dissociation of heavy quarkonium derived by the presence of screening of static color fields in hot qcd medium has long been proposed as a signature of a deconfined medium , and qgp formation  @xcite . since then",
    ", this has been an area of active research  @xcite . however , a precise definition of the dissociation temperature is still elusive and is a matter of intense theoretical and phenomenological investigations either from the perspective of lattice spectral function studies  @xcite or potential inspired models  @xcite or effective quarkonia field theories  @xcite .",
    "the heavy quarks / antiquarks , such as @xmath7 are bound together by almost static gluons  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the gluon self - energy in the static limit can be helpful in understanding the fate of such states in the hot qcd medium .",
    "while modeling the medium modified potential the non - perturbative effects coming from the non - zero string tension between the quark - antiquark pair in the qgp phase is not an unreasonable consideration .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the hadronic to the qgp transition is a crossover .",
    "therefore the string - tension will not vanishes abruptly at or closer to @xmath8 .",
    "one should certainly study its effect on the behavior of quarkonia even above the deconfinement temperature .",
    "this fact has been exploited in the recent past in refs .",
    "@xcite , where a medium - modified form of the heavy quark potential has been obtained by correcting the full cornell potential , not only its coulomb part alone , as usually done in the literature , with a dielectric function encoding the effects of the deconfined medium .",
    "the medium modified potential , thus obtained has a long - range coulomb tail with an ( reduced ) effective charge  @xcite along with the usual debye - screened form employed in most of the literature .",
    "we subsequently used this form to determine the binding energies and the dissociation temperatures of the ground and the first excited states of charmonium and bottomonium spectra .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall consider an isotropic qgp medium which is described in terms of quasi - particle degrees of freedom based on a recently proposed quasi - particle model for hot qcd equations of state based on improved perturbative techniques at weak coupling  @xcite .",
    "we further implement the similar description for the lattice qcd based equations of state  @xcite .",
    "we first obtain the medium modified heavy quark potential ( both real and imaginary parts ) and estimate the dissociation temperatures for 2- , and 3-flavor hot qcd medium . as an intermediate step ,",
    "the binding energies of the different quarkonia state and their respective thermal width have been obtained in the hot qcd / qgp medium .",
    "our predictions have been found to be consistent to the results obtained from other approaches .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "the real part of the heavy - quark potential is discussed in section ii along with debye mass obtained from a quasi - particle model of hot qcd equation of state along with binding energies of various quarkonia bound state by solving the schrdinger equation ( numerically ) . in section iii ,",
    "computations on the imaginary part of the potential and thereby thermal width of the quarkonium has been presented .",
    "section iv , deals with results and discussions .",
    "finally , the conclusions and future prospects of the work has been presented in section v.",
    "the interaction potential between a heavy quark and antiquark gets modified in the presence of a medium .",
    "the static interquark potential plays vital role in understanding the fate of quark - antiquark bound states in the hot qcd / qgp medium .",
    "these aspects have been well studied in the literature and in this direction several excellent reviews exist  @xcite that covers potential model based phenomenology as well as on the lattice qcd based approaches . in all these studies , the form of the potential in the deconfined phase is of yukawa form ( screening coulomb ) .",
    "the prime assumption is that the melting of the string between the quark - antiquark pairs in the deconfined phase is motivated by the fact that there is a phase transition from a hadronic matter to a qgp phase . in the present analysis",
    ", we incorporate the modification to both the coulomb part and confining part in the deconfined medium  @xcite .",
    "this is based on the fact that the transition between the hadronic to the qgp phase is a cross - over as shown by the recent lattice studies  @xcite . in the case of finite - temperature qcd",
    "we here employ the ansatz that the medium modification enters in the fourier transform of heavy quark potential , @xmath9 as  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the dielectric permittivity which is obtained from the static limit of the longitudinal part of gluon self - energy@xcite @xmath12    in our case , @xmath9 in eq.([eq3 ] ) is the fourier transform ( ft ) of the cornell potential ( to compute the ft we need to introduce a modulator of the form @xmath13 and finally let the @xmath14 tends to zero ) , which is obtained as   @xmath15 next , substituting eq.([eqn4 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqn5 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and evaluating the inverse ft , we obtain r - dependence of the medium modified potential  @xcite : @xmath16 interestingly , this potential has a long range coulombic tail in addition to the standard yukawa term .",
    "the constant terms are introduced to yield correct limit of @xmath17 as @xmath18 ( it reduces to the cornell form ) .",
    "note that such terms could appear naturally while performing the basic computations of real time static potential in hot qcd  @xcite and from the real and imaginary time correlators in a thermal qcd medium  @xcite .",
    "the three dimensional form is motivated from the fact that at finite temperature , the flux tube structure may expand in more than one dimension  @xcite . in the limiting case @xmath19 ,",
    "the dominant terms in the potential are the long range coulombic tail and @xmath20 .",
    "the potential will look as , @xmath21 , and can be tackled analytically while solving for the binding energies and the dissociation temperatures for the ground and first excited states of @xmath5 and @xmath22 . in general , one require to set the schrdinger equation with the full potential and solve it numerically for the binding energy . here , we consider the full potential and estimate the binding energies and the dissociation temperatures for heavy quarkonia .",
    "we analyze the spatial dependence of the heavy quark potential later and compare it against the other known forms of the potentials in the forthcoming sections . to that end",
    ", we employ the debye mass computed from the effective fugacity quasi - particle model ( eqpm )  @xcite and compare all the predictions with debye mass obtained in htl and lattice qcd computations .",
    "let us now proceed to discuss the eqpm and debye mass below .",
    "the debye mass , @xmath23 , in qcd is generically non - perturbative and gauge invariant  @xcite unlike qed .",
    "the debye mass in leading - order in qcd coupling at high temperature has been known from long time and is perturbative in nature @xcite . in a work in the past , rebhan  @xcite defined @xmath23 by seeing the relevant pole of the static quark propagator instead of the zero momentum limit of the time - time component of the gluon self - energy .",
    "the @xmath23 thus obtained is seen to be gauge independent .",
    "this follows from the fact that the pole of the self - energy is independent of choice of gauge . in their work ,",
    "braaten and nieto  @xcite calculated the @xmath23 for the qgp at high temperature to the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) in qcd coupling from the correlator of two polyakov loops ( this agrees to the htl result  @xcite ) . arnold and yaffe  @xcite pointed out that the contribution of @xmath24 to the debye mass in qcd needs the knowledge of the non - perturbative physics of confinement of magnetic charge .",
    "they further argued that a perturbative definition of the debye mass as a pole of gluon propagator no longer holds .",
    "importantly , in lattice qcd , the definition of @xmath23 itself , encounters difficulty due to the fact that unlike qed the electric field correlators are not gauge invariant in qcd  @xcite . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "the approaches based on effective theories obtained by dimensional reduction  @xcite , spatial correlation functions of gauge invariant meson correlators  @xcite , and the behavior of the color singlet free energies  @xcite have been proposed . in the concern , in a very recent attemp t by burnier and rothkopf  @xcite",
    "a gauge invariant mass has been defined from a complex static in medium heavy - quark potential obtained from lattice qcd .    to capture all the interaction effects present in hot qcd equations of state in terms of non - interacting quasi - partons ( quasi - gluons and quasi - quarks ) ,",
    "several attempts have been made .",
    "these quasi - partons are nothing but the thermal excitations of the interacting quarks and gluons .",
    "we can categerize them as , ( i ) effective mass models@xcite , ( ii ) effective mass models with polykov loop  @xcite , ( iii ) models based on pnjl and njl  @xciteand ( iv ) effective fugacity model  @xcite . in qcd ,",
    "the quasiparticle model is a phenomenological model which is widely used to describe the non - ideal bahavior of qgp near the phase transition point . the system of interacting massless quarks and gluons can be effectively described as an ideal gas of massive noninteracting quasiparticles in quasiparticle model .",
    "the mass of these quasiparticles is temperature - dependent and arises because of the interactions of quarks and gluons with the surrounding matter in the medium .",
    "these quasiparticles retain the quantum numbers of the real particles i.e. , the quarks and gluons  @xcite .         here , we consider the quasi - particle description @xcite of @xmath25 hot qcd @xcite and @xmath26 hot qcd eoss @xcite , we call them eos1 and eos2 respectively .",
    "we further consider the lattice qcd eos  @xcite in terms of its quasi - particle description , we denote it as leos . although there are more recent lattice results with improved lattice actions and more refined lattice  @xcite , but to update the current model requires pure glue results for the trace anomaly with the same lattice set - up . therefore ,",
    "such attempts are beyond the scope of the present work .",

    "as stated earlier ( on the basis of temperature dependence of the be ) @xmath124 is seen to dissociate at lower temperatures as compared to @xmath77 for both the equations of state .",
    "similarly , for @xmath4 and @xmath79 dissociation temperatures are recorded in table iii and table iv .",
    "the @xmath4 state is seen to dissociate at @xmath128 for @xmath119 , @xmath129 for @xmath121 and for @xmath122 at @xmath130 while employing eos1 through the quasi - particle picture . on the other hand , @xmath79 is seen to dissociate at @xmath131 for @xmath119 , @xmath130 for @xmath121 and for @xmath122 at @xmath131 for the same eos . with eos2 , @xmath4",

    "again , we can see ( on the basis of temperature dependence of the be ) that @xmath4 is seen to dissociate at higher temperatures as compared to @xmath79 for both the equations of state .",
    "the estimates for various quarkonia states under consideration with leos are quoted in table v. the first row records the estimates for the case while the quarkonia dissociation has been led by the average thermal energy of the @xmath135 . on the other hand",
    "the second row captures estimates while the bes are overcomed by the thermal width of quarkonia due to complex nature of the potential(inter - quark ) .",
    "the upper bound obtained in row1 are closer to those with the latter criterion . on comparing the estimate only slightly different .    comparing the numbers for the @xmath116 for various quarkonia states , quoted in table i and table iii , we observe that the quantitative estimates in table iii are quite closer to the upper bound(nr ) criteria .",
    "note that the former estimates are based on the dissolution of a given quarkonia state by the mean thermal energy of the quasi - partons in the hot qcd / qgp medium , the latter one is based on equating the thermal width to the real part of the binding energy ( twice ) .",
    "similar observations are obtained while comparing the estimates from table ii and table iv .",
    "interesting , the numbers obtained by employing eos1 and eos2 with the latter criterion of quarkonia dissociation , the estimates are not very different from each other .",
    "the hot qcd equations of state corresponding to interactions up to @xmath136 and @xmath137 in the improved perturbative qcd can significantly impact the fate of quarkonia in the qgp medium .",
    "the medium modified form of the heavy quark - potential in which the medium modification causes the debye screening of color charges , have been obtained by employing the debye mass obtained by utilizing the quasi - particle understanding of these equations of state .",
    "this , in turn , leads to the temperature dependent binding energies for the @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the binding energies are seen to decreases less sharply for pure gluonic case in comparison to full qcd medium .",
    "similar pattern have been observed for the case of @xmath4 and @xmath79 states .    to estimate the dissociation temperature , we consider two criteria _ viz . _ the dissociation by mean thermal energy of the quasi - particles in the qgp medium and , the binding energy overcoming the thermal width of the quakonia bound state .",
    "the upper and lower bound within the first criterion were obtained by thermal energy @xmath74 and @xmath138 , respectively . in numbers for the dissociation temperatures from both the criteria",
    "are seen to be consistent with the recent predictions from the recent quarkonium spectral function studies using a potential model .",
    "the effects of realistic eos for the qgp have significant impact on the binding energies and the dissociation temperatures for the various quarkonia states .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the quarkonia dissociation in qgp in the isotropic case employing quasi - parton equilibrium distribution functions obtained from @xmath136 and @xmath137 hot qcd equations of state and leos and medium modification to a heavy quark potential .",
    "we have found that medium modification causes a dynamical screening of color charge which , in turn , leads to a temperature dependent of binding energy .",
    "we have systematically studied the temperature dependence of binding energy for the ground and first excited states of charmonium and bottomonium spectra in pure gluonic and full qcd medium .",
    "we have then determined the dissociation of heavy quarkonium in hot qcd medium by employing the medium modification to a heavy quark potential and explore how the pattern changes for pure gluonic case and full qcd in the debye mass .",
    "we intend to look for extensions of the present work in the case of hydrodynamically expanding viscous qgp medium .",
    "another , interesting direction would be to couple the analysis to the physics of momentum anisotropy and instabilities in the early stages of the heavy - ion collisions and its impact on the physics of heavy quarkonia dissociation and yields in heavy - ion collisions .",
