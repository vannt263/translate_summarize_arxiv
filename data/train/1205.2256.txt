    "@xmath6 in the hypercube we get a homomorphism between the exterior algebras at the boundary points of @xmath6 : at @xmath6 we get one of the two pictures in figure [ 1dim ] and each of these pictures gives us a homomorphism which we multiply with @xmath7 .",
    "the homomorphisms at the edges give us the differential for the odd khovanov complex and the properties that @xmath4 has to fulfill guarantee that we have @xmath8 .",
    "if we choose for a given link diagram two different orientations of the arcs of the 0-resolution and two different edge assignments of the same type ( x or y ) , then the two resulting chain complexes are isomorphic .",
