    "the network approach has contributed significantly to our understanding of the structure , function , and response of various complex systems , from genetic transcriptions to human societies  @xcite . in the case of human social systems , this approach was introduced by social scientists and they established important concepts and tools to study them  @xcite . according to the social network paradigm _ social life consists of the flow and exchange of norms , values , ideas , and other social and cultural resources channeled through a network _ @xcite . hence the networks serve as substrates for various collective social phenomena such as diffusion and spreading processes ( of e.g. news and epidemics ) , opinion formation , language evolution , etc .    until recently the studied empirical data sets of social systems remained rather limited",
    "since the basic source of data were questionnaires , thus the focus had been on small scale properties .",
    "however , the most recent development in information - communication technology has opened the possibility to collect much larger data sets from internet , emails , phone records , etc . @xcite . while the scope of these records is narrow as compared to detailed questionnaires , their huge amount and objective quantifiability enable us to study problems , which were impossible to treat before , including the investigation of the structure and dynamics of entire populations @xcite .",
    "much has been learned from these studies such as the broad distributions of network characteristics , the small world properties , the modular organization of the social network , and the relationship between the network topology and the intensity of the ties in the net .",
    "one of the key problems in studying society and social dynamics falls under the term of  opinion formation \" , which deals with a ( measurable ) response of the society to an issue , such as an answer to a political question or the acceptance of innovation .",
    "this problem has attracted a lot of interest and a number of models of competing options have been introduced to study it  @xcite .",
    "the simplest one is the so - called voter model  @xcite , which has a binary opinion variable with the opinion alignment proceeding by a random choice of neighbors .",
    "other discrete opinion formation models include those by weidlich  @xcite and sznajd  @xcite , where more than just a pair of spins is associated with the decision making procedure .",
    "these models are reminiscent to the ising model and in the noiseless ( @xmath0 ) case they usually approach an asymptotic state of consensus ( ferromagnetic state ) .",
    "if these models are studied on complex networks instead of regular lattices  @xcite , the temporal dynamics of the phase transition from one type of consensus to the other one may change significantly . introducing noise or ",
    "social temperature \" makes the analogy with physics even closer and leads to a number of new phenomena from paramagnetic phase to stochastic resonance .",
    "in addition the introduction of an external field as the carrier of the influence of mass media is a natural and widely considered generalization ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also systems with more than two possible opinions have been considered @xcite , which have found natural extension in models where the opinion of individuals is represented by a continuous variable @xcite . by introducing a parameter of bounded confidence or tolerance that describes the situation where",
    "opinions close enough approach each other , the asymptotic state can be quite rich in allowing the coexistence of a number of different opinions .",
    "we also note that opinion dynamics is closely related to problems of competing cultures @xcite or languages @xcite .",
    "opinion formation in a human society is mediated by social interactions between individuals , consequently it takes place on a network of relationships and at the same time it influences the network itself .",
    "such behavior was analyzed in a seminal paper by holme and newman @xcite .",
    "recently this problem of coevolving opinion formation networks was considered for discrete @xcite and continuous @xcite opinion dynamics . in these",
    "the separation of the time scales was controlled by the relative frequency of the opinion updating and rewiring processes , which is an important parameter of the problem .",
    "it was found that the adjustment of the network has a major effect both on the opinion dynamics and on the resulting topology and that minor changes in the updating rules have dramatic consequences . in the case of discrete models it turned out that the self - adaptation of the network resulted in the symmetry breaking of the asymptotic state with respect to the direction of the information transfer . in the case of continuous opinion formation dynamics",
    "rewiring tends on one hand to hinder the consensus formation for large tolerance since it breaks the clusters .",
    "on the other hand there is a tendency to decrease the number of different clusters for small tolerance . in all these investigations agents",
    "were considered to be uniform .",
    "here we also consider the continuous opinion formation in a coevolving network but with the addition that the individuals need not to be uniform . in particular",
    "we examine a situation in which these non - identical individuals form their opinions in information - transferring interactions with others .",
    "this could happen directly through discussions between individuals constituting the network structure or indirectly by sensing the overall mood or opinion of all the other individuals , the effect of which would depend on their personal attitude towards the overall opinion .",
    "we expect that in general the time scale for detectable changes in the network structure is considerably slower than the time scale for the direct social exchanges to take place . in order to describe this situation",
    "we have developed a dynamic network model , where we take into account short range interactions for direct discussions between pairs of individuals , long range interactions for sensing the overall opinion modulated by the attitude of an individual , and external field for outside influence .",
    "the opinion formation dynamics is assumed to take place with a fast time scale well separated from the slow time scale network topology coevolution included by opinion dependent link - rewiring processes of the kind introduced as the basic mechanisms of network sociology @xcite .",
    "note that unlike the model introduced in @xcite our model does not contain any parameter for bounded confidence , which could alter the time scale of network coevolution , as we discuss later .",
    "this paper is organized such that next we describe our model , followed by presenting the numerical results and then by finding analytical solutions to the dynamical equation with mean field approximation .",
    "finally we discuss the results and draw conclusions .",
    "let us consider an opinion formation in a network of a fixed number of individuals or agents ( @xmath1 ) to whom a simple question is posed .",
    "we assume that the agents are unbiased but they have initial opinions concerning the issue of the question .",
    "the process of opinion formation is started by letting the agents to discuss or exchange their views with their acquaintances or friends for some time .",
    "after this some discussions are interrupted at regular intervals to let discussions with new agents to start . at any time an agent may decide to fix its opinion to either total agreement or disagreement , after which the decision is considered irrevocable and no longer modifiable , although the agent continues to discuss and influence others .",
    "the whole process stops when everyone has balloted .",
    "it should be noted that here the aim is not to reach a consensus of opinion , but to give every agent a chance to use its social network to form a point of view through exchange of information .",
    "this kind of a social system can be described by a network where the nodes correspond to the agents and the edges to the links or interactions between them .",
    "each individual agent @xmath2 is described with the time dependent state variable @xmath3}$ ] measuring the agent s instantaneous inclination towards the posed question .",
    "the agent s interactions with other agents are described with the adjacency matrix elements @xmath4 that represent the presence or absence of discussions between the pair of agents related to the question at hand .",
    "thus the initial topology of the network defined by the adjacency matrix @xmath5 changes when the agents are allowed to stop discussions .    as for the evolution dynamics of this system we assume that the state variable @xmath6 of node @xmath2 depends on the links of the network , and likewise the links of the network change according to the values of the state variable of each node .",
    "these mutually dependent processes can be described in general with a dynamical equation of the following form @xmath7 which is based on the assumption of two separate time scales . here",
    "we assume that many discussions take place before a change in the network structure occurs , that is , the time scale for each discussion or exchange of information ( `` transaction '' ) is @xmath8 , while the time scale for a change of connections in the network (  generation \" ) is @xmath9 .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 defines the number of transactions per generation and describes the separation between the fast transaction and slow generation time scales . in this equation",
    "@xmath11 stands for an operator that changes the entries and/or the size of the adjacency matrix .",
    "the actions of the operator @xmath11 are necessarily discrete and limited to few processes . in general",
    "there are only four basic ways to modify a simple network : either one deletes / creates links or deletes / creates nodes .",
    "then a common operation of rewiring can be regarded as a composed operator with one deletion followed by one creation of a link .",
    "an important point in modeling a particular system is that the operator @xmath11 should contain rules for link deletion or creation reflecting all the additional information about the system .    for large @xmath10 or @xmath12 the effect of discreteness of network evolution events on the agent s state variable @xmath6",
    "can be treated separately and the dynamics between such updates is essentially continuous .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) can be approximated as follows @xmath13 where the first term on the right hand side represents the combined effect of an agent @xmath2 sensing the overall opinion of all the other agents ( @xmath14 ) but modulated by the agent s own attitude towards overall or public opinion .",
    "we denote this personal attitude by @xmath15 and assume it being random and uniformly distributed between -1 and 1 , where the former corresponds to completely opposing and the latter to completely agreeing attitude of the agent @xmath2 towards the overall opinion .",
    "the second term on the right hand side represents the direct discussions of the agent @xmath2 with the agents @xmath16 it is linked to .",
    "note that the agents could be different also in their attitudes towards direct discussions , which would introduce another attitude parameter in the second term .",
    "instead @xmath15 should be considered as the relative attitude parameter .",
    "the third term on the right hand side , @xmath17 , is an external field representing the personal bias towards either opinion ( -1 or + 1 ) due to e.g. mass media ( newspapers , tv , radio ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) @xmath18 and @xmath19 standing for the dynamic long and short range interaction terms are defined as follows @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 means the set of nodes that are @xmath23 steps away from node @xmath2 ( or @xmath24 neighbors of @xmath2 ) and @xmath25 is the number of steps needed to reach the most distant neighbors of @xmath2 ( or the maximum range of interactions for @xmath2 ) .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) allows changes of sign in the state variable but also its exponential decay or growth such that @xmath26 could eventually become larger than one , which carries no meaning in our model .",
    "thus we need first to detect the totally convinced agents and stop their dynamics , which can simply be done by a line of computer program  if @xmath27 , then @xmath28 \" , that is , these agents can not modify their state in subsequent times , but they are still linked to the network and taken into account in the dynamical evolution of the undecided agents .    in order to consider the other dynamical process ( and the corresponding time scale ) contained in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , namely network connection topology changes at generation time intervals @xmath12 , we have here adopted the scheme of rewiring .",
    "there are basically two possibilities , either _ global _ or _ local _ rewiring , which we will perform with probability @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "these rewiring schemes are rooted to the fundamental link formation mechanisms of network sociology proposed by kossinet and watts @xcite : _ focal closure _ independently of distance thus being global and _ triadic closure _ between close network neighbors thus being local in nature . in both these schemes , first the agent @xmath2 can choose to cut an existing link with an agent @xmath16 , i.e. end a discussion if their opinions are incompatible . in order to perform this process",
    ", the quantity @xmath31 is calculated and all the links are put in ranking order . then links with larger weights @xmath32 are deleted first since they correspond to divergence of opinion . after this link deletion step follows the link creation step using either local or global rewiring scheme .    in the local rewiring scheme ,",
    "an agent @xmath2 can create a link with a second neighbor by starting a discussion with the  friend of a friend \" if this new link can help the agent in reaching a state of total conviction ( @xmath33 ) . in order to determine this we calculate the quantity @xmath34 \\frac{|x_i + x_j|}{2},\\ ] ] where the first two factors including the adjacency matrix ( with @xmath35 $ ] being the discrete step function @xmath36 = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-2 } \\delta_{k , x}$ ] ) , test the existence of a link to the second neighbor and the third factor",
    "@xmath37 is the measure of similarity of opinions between the agents .",
    "then all the potential local rewiring links are put to ranking order , of which the links with larger weights @xmath38 are created first .    in the global rewiring scheme ,",
    "an agent @xmath2 can create a link with further neighbors ( @xmath39 ) provided their opinions are similar . in order to determine this we follow a similar procedure as above by calculating instead the following quantity @xmath40\\right ) \\left(1 - \\frac{|x_i - x_j|}{2}\\right),\\ ] ] where once again the first two factors test the far link existence and the third the similarity of opinions between agents , followed by putting the potential links to ranking order and creating links with larger weights first .",
    "the rewiring of _ each _ node @xmath2 is done in such a fashion that the number of links deleted is equal to the number of links created .",
    "therefore , the total number of links should be conserved .",
    "this is clearly the case when the rewiring is performed sequentially , but in case of parallel rewiring ( as we do ) it could happen that if both agents @xmath2 and @xmath16 are performing rewiring simultaneously , their mutual actions could lead to the net creation or deletion of a link .",
    "then the total number of links would not be conserved .",
    "next we will present the numerical results of our model followed by the analytical mean field theory treatment of the dynamical equation .",
    "for computer simulations we have first initialized our model system to a random network configuration of @xmath1 nodes and average degree @xmath41 .",
    "this is done in the beginning of each simulation run to secure a different random configuration for the initial network and good statistics for the averaged quantities of interest . as other initial conditions we chose the fixed constant @xmath15 for the personal attitude and the state variable @xmath42 of agent @xmath2 randomly from a uniform distribution between -1 and 1 and from a gaussian distribution with unit standard deviation , respectively .",
    "in addition we chose all the external bias field terms to be @xmath43 .    with these initial choices",
    "we are left with only two parameters to vary , namely @xmath29 and @xmath10 , upon which the average properties of the final network should depend and scale with the initial conditions @xmath41 and @xmath1 . for the sake of simplicity we here set @xmath44 in all our numerical simulations , which means that we take into account only the local rewiring to study the effect of the parameter @xmath10 alone .    since",
    "our model includes fast transaction dynamics and slower generation dynamics for network rewiring the simulations have been carried out by using the following two - step process . in the first step the dynamics of transactions described with eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) is realized by numerical integration using a simple euler method , in which the time step was set to @xmath45 as found to guarantee the stability and reliability of the numerical calculations . by keeping the parameters fixed the system",
    "is driven until the specified time ( @xmath46 ) or @xmath10 time steps to then do the second step , namely the network rewiring with the procedure described in the previous section .",
    "this two - step process is iterated until the system reaches its final state , where no more changes in the @xmath6 s and in the network connections take place .",
    "we have found that the way the system approaches its final state consists of two regimes , which can be analyzed by controlling the number of changed links per cycle .",
    "the first regime shows a rapid roughly exponential decay where both the number of agents that change opinions and the number of rewired links is high .",
    "this fast decay crosses over to a very slow regime after most of the agents have reached either opinion @xmath47 or @xmath48 . during this slow decay ,",
    "when frustrated links try to get optimal positions and the remaining few undecided agents converge their opinions to @xmath47 or @xmath48 , the network structure is found not to change significantly .",
    "these few `` non - conformists '' that take extremely long time to get fully convinced may serve as kind of nucleation centers if an external field ( media effect ) is switched on , which is an issue we will investigate in the future .    from the simulation results we calculated the following averaged single site properties : the degree @xmath49 , the shortest path @xmath50 , the average clustering coefficient @xmath51 ,",
    "the mean number of second neighbors @xmath52 , and the average cluster size or susceptibility @xmath53 that is the second moment of the number of @xmath54-size clusters , see e.g.  @xcite . according to percolation theory",
    "the sums run over all the cluster sizes excluding the giant component , as identified in finite samples with the largest cluster .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the various properties of the final network as a function of @xmath10 , averaged over 100 realizations for the initial average degree @xmath55 and for the system size @xmath56 .",
    "=    here one can visually distinguish three regions of behaviour .",
    "for small @xmath57 the dynamics of the state variable is practically irrelevant and accordingly , the rewiring of the network is random and favours the formation of triangles .",
    "the final network appears divided into two large cliques of about @xmath58 nodes with almost no connections between them , as expected from models without dynamics .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath10 is larger than the mean number of iterations ( i.e. @xmath59 ) needed for the state variable to reach either of its extreme values at all sites , no rewiring of the network is seen to occur .",
    "thus the resulting network shows the properties of an erds - renyi graph , i.e. @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , since the initial network is random no apparent clustering of the two opposite opinions is seen to develop .",
    "=    for the intermediate @xmath10 values both dynamical processes , slow and fast , are at play and the net result is that the final configuration of the network shows a segregation of several well - connected communities of roughly similar size and of uniform opinion , as the ones shown in the middle top of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "such result makes this model of opinion formation suitable to describe the complex community structure often found in human societies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is relevant to mention that mandr _",
    "@xcite have studied rewiring in the ising - glauber dynamics with tunable thresholds and identified the emergent domains of spins with communities .",
    "such an emergence of medium size communities is clearly seen in the susceptibility @xmath62 , which peaks strongly ( by two orders of magnitude ) for the range of @xmath10 from about 10 to more than @xmath63 .",
    "it should be noted here that computationally the algorithm to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) in a rewiring network goes roughly as @xmath64 , which makes the simulation of systems with more than 1000 nodes very time - consuming .",
    "however , as it is seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the system size dependence of all quantities is monotonic and can thus be extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "hence a subject of further study would be to investigate the nature of the transitions between the observed morphological phases .",
    "in addition , we would like to point out that all the other quantities show gradual behavior as a function of @xmath10 . in the models of opinion formation without network dynamics ,",
    "the resulting network is either a single cluster of consensus or two clusters of about the same size with opposite opinions .",
    "( as stated before we do not have bounded confidence in our model , which could be another source of the creation of many communities @xcite . )",
    "note that to produce the graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we have used a visualization software  @xcite that tends to group agents according to their topological properties , and consequently communities are distinguishable by the eye .",
    "it is worth pointing out that within each community all its agents share the same opinion . in most previous studies",
    "the similarity of attributes between agents has not been considered to define communities ( see for instance the recent comprehensive review by fortunato @xcite ) .    in order to find out whether the communities formed by agents of the same opinion match the ones formed by topological similarities",
    ", we have used the community detection algorithm based on the local fitness concept described by lancichinetti _",
    "_ @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we show the results for the network configuration at the middle top of fig .  [ fig:1 ] by using eq .",
    "( 1 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , with the resolution parameter set to @xmath65 .",
    "observe that in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] the color coding for the opinions allows the eye to distinguish four well - defined communities , while in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] the algorithm based on the local fitness separates the network into _ seven _ communities .",
    "note that although there is in general good correspondence between these two partitions , the community detection algorithm reveals sub - structure that the eye does not capture .",
    "the key point is to investigate what are the circumstances that drive the system to form many communities of approximately the same size . here",
    "the role of the personal attitude parameter @xmath15 is very important , since a network with agents having all positive @xmath66 s should reach consensus quite rapidly without community structure forming , while a network with only negative @xmath66 s should separate into two clusters of different opinions .",
    "however , in case of @xmath66 s being randomly distributed ( as is assumed in this study ) frustration is introduced to the system , making the network structured .",
    "it is instructive to look at the distribution of the @xmath66 s and how it relates to the cluster structure . for small values of @xmath10 , where the rewiring process is very rapid and",
    "only two clusters eventually develop , the attitude parameters have a minor role , so the @xmath66 distributions in the two clusters are broad and similar .",
    "however , for the intermediate @xmath10 values the situation is different . here",
    "the smaller clusters have a rather narrow distribution with mostly negative @xmath66 values , while the distributions for larger clusters are broad and shifted toward positive @xmath66 values .",
    "naturally , the agents with negative @xmath66 s do not feel comfortable in a large homogenous cluster , thus they tend to build smaller communities .",
    "it is interesting that the personal attitude of an agent has such an important effect on the clustering properties of the system in spite of the fact that it is not defined as a bias towards a certain opinion but rather as an agent s ability or intention to adjust or not to any kind of opinion of the other agents .",
    "the high connectivity and clustering coefficient of the final network configuration is the result of the appearance of communities : if there are @xmath67 communities of size @xmath68 , then @xmath69 and if the clusters continue to be random , then @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the region of values of @xmath10 for which @xmath71 is constant is where there are communities of size @xmath72 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we show this ratio as a function of @xmath10 for networks of different size .",
    "notice that the region where communities are formed is wider for larger networks and that as the network size is increased the number of clusters @xmath67 increases as well . in the inset",
    "we show the value of @xmath67 for networks of various sizes , averaged over 1000 realizations and keeping @xmath73 constant .",
    "it is worth noticing that the mean field prediction for a network of size @xmath74 is that the system contains about eight communities on average , which agrees well with the seven communities found by the local fitness approach used in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "= +    in addition we have calculated the average neighborhood degree as a function of node degree and found that our final networks show _ assortative mixing _ , i.e. high degree nodes are connected to other high degree nodes , as is common in other social networks . as a kind of hypothetical exercise",

    "( [ eq:6 ] ) by substituting @xmath76 with @xmath75 thus favouring similar opinions in link deletion and opposite opinions in local rewiring , respectively , the final networks shows _ dissortative mixing _ instead .    furthermore , though not reported in detail in this paper",

    "we have performed calculations in networks of size @xmath74 , keeping @xmath77 and @xmath78 constant , and varying @xmath29 from 0 to 1 .",
    "the main result is that the clustering coefficient remains practically constant , except when @xmath79 , where it decays .",
    "the average shortest path is reduced when @xmath29 increases , which is to be expected , since focal closure offers the opening of long jumps in the network in the same manner as disorder produces small world properties in a ring .",
    "finally , the average degree increases slightly with @xmath29 , also explainable by the same token .",
    "more studies in this direction will be made in the future .",
    "in order to understand better the numerical results we analyze our model by using a mean field approach . with this one can investigate , for instance , how rapidly the agents reach an irrevocable opinion , that is , how the mean number of decided ( or undecided ) agents behaves as a function of time in early stages of the dynamics , or when @xmath80 .",

    "indeed , the difference between the mean field prediction and the numerical value can be used as a measure of the amount of frustration , which can become important in subsequent rewirings .",
    "so far we have analyzed the fast dynamics of the state variable but have not considered the rewiring processes .",
    "an interesting thing to do is to compare the deviations of our model results from the known properties of a random network , for instance @xmath110 notice that in our model @xmath49 should be constant to first order , since the network changes are such that every time a link is deleted another one must be created . therefore , a change of degree @xmath111 is due to simultaneous actions of both agents connected by a link in the parallel rewiring scheme .    in each rewiring event",
    "every agent deletes and creates the same number of links , so the agent s degree does not change .",

    "similarly , if two agents independently decide to create a link between them and both have deleted different links , the average degree decreases .",

    "however , this holds only in a tree , where all the second neighbors are different , but in a general network there should be cyclic closures , like triangles ( @xmath120 ) and squares ( @xmath121 )",
    ". then one may write @xmath122 where the summation runs over the first neighbors of @xmath2 .",
    "the factor of 2 in the second term is due to the fact that there are two triangles associated with a single triad . the exact count of links , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) is @xmath123 .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] the number of triangles is related to the clustering coefficient as @xmath124    so far we have not made any approximations .",
    "the factors @xmath114 and @xmath125 are time dependent through the dynamics of the state variables @xmath6 .",
    "it is clear that these factors are non - zero only if the two sites involved in the same rewiring process are still undecided , that is , the probability of having one of these correlated rewirings should be proportional to @xmath126 , and can be calculated numerically by keeping track of the rewiring matrices @xmath127 and @xmath128 defined as @xmath129 and @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are subsets of the first and second neighbors of agent @xmath2 , such that their cardinalities are the same because rewiring is the only operation allowed ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) ) .",
    "then it is clear that @xmath133    the normalization factor comes from the fact that only operations taking place by both agents @xmath2 and @xmath16 simultaneously contribute to the count in @xmath2 .",
    "this is proportional to @xmath134 where @xmath135 .",
    "then @xmath136 .",
    "one can neglect the term @xmath137 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) because the number of squares should be small as compared with the number of triangles .",
    "also , we may assume that @xmath138 is very similar in all sites and near to 1/2 .",
    "in fact one can trace the mean value of @xmath138 as a function of time in the numerical calculations and see that it converges very rapidly to the value 1/2 . performing the average over @xmath2 and assuming the degree , the fraction of nodes , and the clustering coefficient statistically independent we obtain @xmath139,\\ ] ] where we have suppressed the brackets indicating averages and dropped the subindex in all the quantities .",
    "therefore , we find a fixed point when @xmath140    in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we plot the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq:20 ] ) with @xmath141 ( continuous line ) and compare it with the numerical results ( open circles ) and the linear dependence predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) for a random network ( dashed line ) .",
    "note that for any given average degree @xmath142 the clustering coefficient for the mean field and numerical results is larger than for a random network , and for @xmath143 all the clustering coefficients meet at value 1/2 .",
    "also we would like to point out that although in the mean field approximation we have taken only a part of the second order effects into account , it behaves qualitatively the same as the numerical result .",
    "in this paper we present a general approach to the problem of opinion formation on an adaptive network , which can be considered as a basic problem of social network formation and communication . the dynamical equation eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and its modification eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) contain several aspects of this problem , which to our knowledge have not been considered or addressed before .",
    "first , the role of general opinion of all the agents in the system representing the overall mood sensed by each individual with his / her own attitude towards it .",
    "second , the effect of the media as a kind of external field term , not as a constant field as suggested before ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) but as an agent dependent reaction term corresponding to a personal attitude towards the `` manipulation '' attempts by the media .",
    "this makes the system reminiscent to a random field model .",
    "third , in our model the two time scales of the basic dynamical processes are clearly separated and deterministically controlled , unlike in other studies where an additional parameter like bounded confidence controls the range within which different opinions act on each other @xcite , thus affecting the time scale at which opinions change .",
    "we note that also in our model the bounded confidence parameter could be included , but we chose not to do so in the interest of not increasing the number of adjustable parameters in the model .",
    "fourth , in our model the rewiring has been done deterministically favoring the triadic closure mechanism rather than random rewiring mechanisms used in other studies @xcite . in our model both the basic link - rewiring mechanisms of network sociology , namely focal and triadic closure , have been included but in this paper we have mainly focused on the effects of the latter rewiring mechanism .    in this study rather than exploring the entire richness of our model , we have concentrated on the effect of the separation of time scales for comparison with previous results .",
    "we have shown that the important feature of coevolution is the separation of the two basic time scales , namely , the rapid dynamics of the state variable , and the slow dynamics of the network rewiring .",
    "the only parameter of our model has been @xmath10 , serving as a measure of this separation .    as one of the key results we have found that for intermediate values of the time scale variable @xmath10 the network turns out to organize in well - connected small communities of agents with the same opinion .",
    "this is in accordance with the earlier study @xcite , where it was found that communities could form when the tolerance or bounded confidence parameter was varied , which could be understood to be due this parameter changing the effective time scale for rewiring .",
    "in addition we have studied further the role of the difference in time scales for fast and slow dynamics analytically by devising a mean field treatment . using random network as a reference , we have found that the mean field results compare quite well with the numerical results and both of them differ significantly from the random network results .    in the future",
    "we plan to investigate our model systematically and in detail for the effects of personal attitude parameter @xmath15 and the personal random field term of an agent @xmath17 , as well as the relative importance parameter @xmath29 between local rewiring with triadic closure and global rewiring with focal closure mechanisms .",
    "furthermore , another interesting point to investigate in our model would be the relative importance of short and long range interactions .    as a final remark",
    "we believe that our fully dynamical approach and the kind of coevolving network model could be applied to various other situations , not only in social networks but in other fields , like symbiotic relations between two species sharing an ecological environment .",
    "some of these applications are currently a matter of further explorations .",
