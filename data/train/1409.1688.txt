    "in the insulating transition - metal ( tm ) oxides , superexchange ( se ) coupling of neighboring magnetic ions via intermediate oxygen , according to the goodenough - kanamori - anderson rules  @xcite , commonly plays a leading role in their magnetic order .",
    "one simple but useful rule is that for a linear @xmath7-o-@xmath8 exchange path , the se would be antiferromagnetic ( af ) [ ferromagnetic ( fm ) ] when the active orbitals of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are same [ different ] .",
    "1(a ) shows two @xmath9 ions each having two orthogonal a - b levels and the same a - level occupation . taking into account an effective hopping @xmath10 between two ions associated with the charge fluctuation ( @xmath11 ) where the electron correlation hubbard @xmath12 is involved ,",

    "this is the reason why a fm mott insulator is often associated with orbital physics ( e.g. , an orbital ordering ) and its @xmath18 is much lower ( due to the factor @xmath17/@xmath12 @xmath19 1/5 ) than the @xmath20 of many af mott insulators .    in practice ,",
    "it is often sufficient to consider the se between the nearest neighboring ( nn ) magnetic ions only .",
    "this approach applies with much success to numerous insulating @xmath21 tm oxides , where the @xmath21 electrons are quite localized due to the strong correlation effect . in recent years , @xmath6 tm oxides have received considerable attention due to their significant spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) effect and possibly exotic properties  @xcite .",
    "the hybrid @xmath21-@xmath6 tm oxides are also of current great interest for exploration of novel magnetic and electronic properties in this material system , in which new soc effects add to the common charge - spin - orbital physics appearing in the @xmath21 tm oxides . among them , the double perovskites @xmath22o@xmath1 ( @xmath23 = alkaline earth metal , @xmath24 = @xmath21 tm , and @xmath25 = @xmath6 tm ) are an important material platform  @xcite : sr@xmath0fereo@xmath1 is an above room temperature ( rt ) ferrimagnetic half metal  @xcite , and sr@xmath0croso@xmath26 is a ferrimagnetic insulator with a seemingly highest @xmath18 in the perovskite oxides  @xcite , etc .",

    "the corresponding energy difference of 19 mev / fu for la@xmath0nisio@xmath1 gives af @xmath49 = 19/8 @xmath47 2.4 mev , see table i.    as the magnetic ir@xmath4 and ni@xmath2 ions have closed subshells , the se interactions naturally explain the af @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "note that the ni@xmath2 @xmath21 electrons are confined but the ir@xmath4 @xmath6 electrons are delocalized , it is therefore not surprising that @xmath48 is about four times as big as @xmath49 .",
    "however , it is a bit surprising that the 2nn af @xmath48 is even bigger than the 1nn fm @xmath46 , thus giving rise to a magnetic frustration in sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1 .",
    "this vital role of the strong 2nn af ir - ir coupling is also manifested in the real double perovskite sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 , see below .",
    "sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 has a very similar crystal structure and magnetic property to sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1 , and it has af interactions at @xmath20 = 46 k.  @xcite we have also calculated different magnetic states of sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 and find the 2nn af @xmath48 = 75/8 @xmath47 9.4 mev ( see table i ) , being close to @xmath48 = 10.5 mev in sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1 . as the delocalized ir @xmath6 electrons produce a long - range magnetic interaction , we also estimate the 3nn af @xmath53 ( the exchange path along the linear ir - o - ni - o - ir bonds with the ir - ir distance of 7.8  ) by calculating the bilayered af state of sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 .",
    "the bilayered af state has fm @xmath50 planes but af alternation every bilayer along the @xmath51 axis , and it is more stable than the fm state by 42 mev / fu . the exchange energy per formula unit can be expressed as 6@xmath48 + 3@xmath53 for the fm state and 2@xmath48 + @xmath53 for the bilayered af state .",
    "therefore , the af @xmath53 is estimated to be ( 42  4 @xmath38 9.4 ) / 2 = 2.2 mev .    as seen from the above results ,",
    "apparently the ir - ir magnetic interactions are long - ranged and have a non - negligible strength even at a distance of about 8  .",
    "it is the long - range af interactions of the ir@xmath4 sublattice which make sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 magnetically frustrated .",
    "it is the strongest 2nn af @xmath48 which overwhelms the 1nn fm @xmath46 and also makes sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1 magnetically frustrated . in a word",
    ", the long - range magnetic interactions and frustration would make the cubic double perovskites sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1 and sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 distorted , and this would partially relieve the magnetic frustration and eventually stabilize them into a very similar low - temperature antiferromagnet as experimentally observed  @xcite .",
    "@xmath37 dos projected onto the soc basis set , the @xmath54 = 3/2 quartet ( solid red curves ) and the @xmath54 = 1/2 doublet ( dashed blue curves ) .",
    "( a ) in sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 , the overall mixing of the @xmath54 = 3/2 and @xmath54 = 1/2 states is due to the band formation of the delocalized ir @xmath6 electrons in the fcc ir sublattice with twelve ir - ir coordination .",
    "( b ) the soc splitting of about 0.5 ev between the @xmath54 = 3/2 and the @xmath54 = 1/2 states is restored upon the reduction of the ir - ir coordination to four , which is modeled in the artificial system sr@xmath0gair@xmath55si@xmath55o@xmath1 ( in sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 structure ) with alternating gair and siga planes . , width=264 ]    finally , we check if the soc is important or not in the present materials .",
    "normally , soc is important in heavy @xmath6 tms , and particularly , iridates recently receive great interest  @xcite . owing to a large crystal - field splitting , iridates are in a low - spin state with only the @xmath37 occupation ( e.g. , in a cubic crystal field )",
    ". then the soc splits the @xmath37 triplet ( with 2-fold spin degeneracy ) into the lower @xmath54 = 3/2 quartet and the higher @xmath54 = 1/2 doublet  @xcite .",
    "we have used this soc basis set to project the ir@xmath4 @xmath37 dos of sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 calculated by lda+soc , but we find that the @xmath54 = 3/2 and the @xmath54 = 1/2 states are completely mixed , see fig .",
    "therefore , the @xmath54 = 3/2 and the @xmath54 = 1/2 states are not at all eigen orbitals in sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 ( and in sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1 with the same fcc ir@xmath4 sublattice ) .",
    "this is because the delocalized ir @xmath6 electrons form , with the intersite electron hoppings in the fcc sublattice ( the high coordination of twelve ) , a ` broad ' band with its bandwidth being more than 1 ev . then the soc effect is ` killed ' .",
    "in contrast , if the ir - ir coordination number is reduced as in the low - dimensional iridates , the soc effect would be manifested . to check this",
    ", we also calculate the artificial system sr@xmath0gair@xmath55si@xmath55o@xmath1 ( in sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 structure ) with alternating gair and siga planes .",
    "the ga@xmath32 , ir@xmath4 and si@xmath56 ions have well comparable ionic sizes , and they make charge balanced and the ir@xmath4-ir@xmath4 ions only four - coordinated . in this case , the soc splitting of about 0.5 ev between the @xmath54 = 3/2 and the @xmath54 = 1/2 states is well restored as seen in fig .",
    "5(b ) , and thus the @xmath54 = 3/2 and the @xmath54 = 1/2 states would serve as eigen orbitals in a good approximation  @xcite .",
    "the above results show that in sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 and sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1 , the delocalized ir@xmath4 @xmath6 electrons have an insignificant soc effect due to the band formation in the fcc sublattice . moreover , the half filled @xmath5 subshell of the high - valence ir@xmath4 ion has an intrinsic exchange splitting of about 1 ev , see fig .",
    "both the band effect and the exchange splitting are stronger than the soc strength , making the soc ineffective in sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1 and sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 .",
    "our lsda+@xmath12+soc test calculations indeed show that the ir@xmath4 ion has only a small orbital moment of 0.07 @xmath43 , being antiparallel to the spin moment of about 1.3 @xmath43 reduced from the formal @xmath42 = 3/2 . therefore",

    "in summary , using density functional calculations , we find that the newly synthesized isostructural double perovskites sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1 and sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 are insulating and have the formal ir@xmath4 @xmath42 = 3/2 fcc sublattice , in addition to the ni@xmath2 @xmath42 = 1 sublattice in the former .",
