    "in the primary visual area ( v1 ) of many mammals , most neurons respond to the stimulation of two eyes unevenly : they are either right or left eye dominated . in some species ,",
    "right / left eye dominated neurons are segregated and form a system of alternating monocular regions known as the ocular dominance pattern ( odp ) ( wiesel and hubel , 1965 , 1969 ) . in others ,",
    "odp is not observed ( see horton and hocking , 1996b for a comprehensive list of species ) .",
    "odps , when observed , vary significantly between different species and even between different parts of v1 in the same animal .",
    "most modeling studies of odp ( erwin et al . , 1995 ;",
    "swindale , 1996 ) have addressed its development .",
    "they succeeded in generating odps of realistic appearance .",
    "however , several _ why _ rather than _ how _ questions remained unanswered .",
    "for instance , ( 1 ) why , from functional point of view , do the odps exist ? ( 2 ) why do some mammalian species exhibit odps while others do not ( horton and hocking , 1996b ; livingstone , 1996 ) ? ( 3 ) why do the monocular regions have different appearance ( stripes as opposed to patches ) between different parts of v1 within the same animal ( levay et al . , 1985 ) ?",
    "the question of functional significance of odps has been addressed theoretically using the wiring economy principle ( mitchison , 1991 ; chklovskii , 2000 ) .",
    "the idea is that evolutionary pressure to keep the brain volume to a minimum requires making the wiring ( axons and dendrites ) as short as possible , while maintaining neuronal functional properties ( cajal , 1995 ; allman and kaas , 1974 ; cowey , 1979 ; cherniak , 1992 ; young , 1992 ; chklovskii et al .",
    ", 2001 ; koulakov and chklovskii , 2001 )",
    ". in many cases these functional properties are specified by the rules of establishing connections between neurons , or wiring rules .",
    "the problem presented by the wiring economy principle is therefore to find , for given wiring rules , the spatial neuronal layout that minimizes the total connection length .",
    "this approach allows to understand many features in cortical maps , such as orientation preference maps ( koulakov and chklovskii , 2001 ) , as evolutionary adaptations , which minimize the total cortical volume .",
    "the goal of this study is to find the simplest model , which on one hand is supported by experimental evidence , and on the other encompasses most of od phenomenology .",
    "the use of the simple model allows us to explore its parameter space completely and to give answers to the set of questions above .",
    "we also evaluate the dependence of the odp period on the parameters of our model and compare it to the odp periodicity observed in macaque monkey .",
    "we find that the experimentally observed variation of the period is in agreement with the wiring economy theory .",
    "for the purposes of minimizing the cortical wiring we consider only intra - cortical connections since they constitute the majority of gray matter wiring ( levay and gilbert , 1976 ; peters and payne , 1993 ; ahmed et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "we therefore disregard the thalamic afferents and other extra - cortical projections . in an attempt to make wiring economy argument",
    "more quantitative , we propose a model describing the component of intracortical circuitry sensitive to od .",
    "the principal elements of our model are therefore the connection rules between cortical neurons . to assess the sensitivity of the intracortical wiring to od we examine the connections in the cortical layer @xmath1 , where od is most strongly pronounced .",
    "such sensitivity has been studied by katz et al .",
    "they made three observations regarding the wiring rules :    _ i ) _ neurons in the layer @xmath1 near the interface between two od columns arborize more in home rather than in the opposite eye column .",
    "therefore neurons establish more connections with the neurons dominated by the same rather than by the opposite eye .",
    "_ ii ) _ axons and dendrites of these neurons have a tendency to bend away from the interface between od columns .",
    "this implies that not only they avoid penetration to the opposite od column but also they attempt to maintain sufficiently high number of connections in the home column .    _",
    "iii ) _ axons or dendrites penetrating through the opposite eye column to the next same eye column are _ never _ observed .",
    "this means that retinotopy has little effect on connections in layer @xmath1 .",
    "indeed the neurons on the edges of two same eye columns separated by one opposite eye column have on average receptive fields centered next to each other . if connections in @xmath1 were sensitive to the retinotopic coordinates , these two edges should be connected ( mitchison , 1991 ) .",
    "however out of 21 cells examined katz et al .",
    "( 1989 ) observed _ none _ producing axons reaching the next same eye domain .",
    "the only possibility for such cells to be connected is due to the overlap between dendritic and axonic arbors of two cells separated by more than @xmath2 @xmath3 m .",
    "such possibility is small because of the strong repulsion of the connections by the opposite eye column located between two cells ( observation _ i ) _ ) .",
    "these three observations lay the basis of our model which we now describe .",
    "the elementary unit of our model mimics the columnar organization of the cortex ( mountcastle , 1957 ) and uniformity of odp along the direction normal to the slab .",
    "the elementary unit is therefore a microcolumn , which is defined as a box , spanning the cortex perpendicular to its surface , whose other two dimensions are smaller than the characteristic scale of odp ( @xmath4 ) , and yet large enough to include many neurons .",
    "a possible choice of dimensions for such a microcolumn is _ thickness of cortex _",
    "@xmath5 mm @xmath6 @xmath7 , in which case it includes about 310 cells in v1 ( rockel et al . , 1980 ) .",
    "the microcolumn units are therefore arranged on a square lattice with 30@xmath3 period .",
    "although the choice of the elementary unit size may seem arbitrary , the results of our calculation are independent of the choice .",
    "the size of the unit is analogous to the integration step , which does not affect the value of an integral significantly if chosen to be small enough .     ,",
    "width=144 ]    motivated by the second observation in layer @xmath1 listed above , i.e. that neurons maintain a fixed number of connections in the home od column , we make the following assumption about the connection rules",
    ". each microcolumn unit must establish connections with @xmath8 distinct units dominated by the same eye and @xmath9 units dominated by the opposite eye .",
    "these connection rules are illustrated in fig .",
    ".    only the relative values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( rather than absolute ) are important because of the arbitrariness in the definition of microcolumn .",
    "thus , if a @xmath10 microcolumn receives @xmath11 projections from the same od column and @xmath12 projections from the opposite od column , a @xmath13 microcolumn receives four times less projections respectively , or @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this is because with coarser units each projection is more effective : connecting to one @xmath13 unit implies connecting to four @xmath10 units .",
    "both these implementations of the model produce the same od pattern , discretized in `` pixels '' of different size .",
    "the important quantity , which is invariant with respect to the change of `` pixel''/microcolumn size , is the ratio between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( equal to 10 in this example ) .",
    "this is the first parameter of our model .",
    "the second parameter of our model is the filling fraction of the units ( microcolumns ) dominated by the left eye afferents @xmath16 with respect to the total number of units , averaged over several odp periods .",
    "this parameter is the fraction of the left eye dominated units @xmath16 by @xmath17 . for the majority of important cases",
    "@xmath18 , however on the periphery of visual field one of the eyes ( ipsilateral ) is underrepresented .",
    "therefore , its filling fraction is less than @xmath19 .",
    "the third observation above implies that the component of connections sensitive to od is not sensitive to the retinotopy , and both numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 do not depend on the position of the receptive field of the unit .",
    "this may be due to significant scatter of the receptive field of the cells within cortical column on the scales of about 1 mm ( hubel and wiesel , 1974 ) .",
    "the position of the receptive field of the microcolumn is therefore vaguely defined and can not affect od sensitive connections significantly .      given these wiring rules",
    "we look for an optimal layout of the microcolumn units which minimizes the total length of connections . to find the layout minimizing the total wirelength",
    "we employ a combination of computational and analytical techniques . to make our choice of methods clear we first comment on the expected properties of the solution .",
    "a possible solution of our model is the _ salt and pepper _ layout in which the units dominated by right and left eyes are uniformly intermixed . in this layout the units belonging to different eyes are not segregated , odp is not formed , and the local values of the filling fraction are equal to @xmath19 ( by local value we understand an average over a domain including many units yet small compared to the period of odp ) . it should be contrasted to the case when units dominated by the same eye fill in large domains i.e. form the odp . in the latter case the local values of the filling factor of each eye vary from 0 to 1 .",
    "however one can imagine an intermediate situation when the local filling fraction varies from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , where the amplitude of variation @xmath22 .",
    "this corresponds to the case of _ weak segregation _ into odp .",
    "the weak segregation is found in squirrel monkey where odp has fuzzy appearance and until recently was suspected not to be formed ( horton and hocking , 1996 ) .",
    "if @xmath23 , i.e. the local filling fraction varies from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , the odp s have sharp appearance .",
    "using the general terminology from binary mixtures ( cite diblock copolimer paper ) we call this regime the _ strong segregation _ limit .",
    "the methods useful in the strong segregation limit are not good in the weak segregation case and vice versa .",
    "we use the simulated annealing to find the optimum phases for the strong and nearly strong segregation cases . having found the optimum phase in the strong segregation case to assess the period of odp we use the exact enumeration technique , which compares layouts belonging to the same phase with different periods .",
    "the treatment of the weak segregation case requires the use of continuous variables and is done employing the perturbation theory .",
    "below we describe these methods in more detail .      the parameters of metropolis monte - carlo method ( metropolis et al . , 1953 )",
    "are optimized to render most consistent results for multiple restarts .",
    "we use square @xmath26 array of units with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the units are either left or right eye dominated . at each step",
    "the algorithm attempts to change the dominance of one unit to the opposite .",
    "the value of the average filling fraction @xmath27 is enforced by adding the following term to the total connection length : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath16 are the current values of the total wirelength and average filling fraction . such term in",
    "the functional keeps the current value @xmath16 close to the required value @xmath27 .    to map out the phase diagram the values of @xmath16 change from @xmath30 to @xmath31 in @xmath32 increments .",
    "the values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 satisfy the condition @xmath33 and are changed in unit increments , i.e. have the following values : 12 , 18 ; 13 , 17 ; 14 , 16 ; 15 , 15 ; 16 , 14 ; etc .",
    "the phases at the intermediate points are taken from the nearest points , where result is available .    the monte - carlo temperature is gradually annealed from @xmath34 to @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is the total number of units ) in 5000 sweeps through the entire system ( @xmath37 steps ) .",
    "the resulting layout is then examined and the phases visually identified .      _ salt and pepper _ layout is relatively easy to study due to its uniformity , and can be solved exactly ( chklovskii and koulakov , 2000 ) . if a layout does not deviate significantly from _ salt and pepper _ ,",
    "i.e. the weak segregation case takes place , it can also be solved exactly .",
    "this implies that the wire length can be written as an explicit functional of density distribution of the units .",
    "such functional was evaluated and optimized with respect to the density variations by chklovskii and koulakov ( 2000 ) .",
    "the optimization shows that odps are formed for the values of parameter @xmath38 .",
    "however the simulated annealing method can not distinguish weak segregated odp from _ salt and pepper _ for @xmath39 .",
    "there are two reasons for the failure of simulated annealing to do so :    * simulated annealing is performed at small but finite temperature that destroys weakly segregated odp .",
    "* the units can be either completely right or left eye dominated .",
    "this implies that od can change only sharply in the described annealing version .",
    "this is useful for obtaining the strongly segregated phases , which occupy major part of the parameter space .",
    "however , in the weak segregation limit the local od changes smoothly .",
    "thus used version of simulated annealing performs poorly at @xmath40 .",
    "we therefore replace the simulated annealing results by those from chklovskii and koulakov ( 2000 ) at small values of parameter @xmath41 ( see the phase diagram below ) .      to evaluate the period of odp precisely , we first determine the phase ( _ salt and pepper _ , _ stripes _ , or _ patches _ ) for the given set of parameters @xmath42 and @xmath16 , using methods described above .",
    "we then take a lattice containing a large number of units , which exceeds sufficiently the lattice used in simulated annealing .",
    "this is possible because the method of determining period described below is much less time consuming than simulated annealing .",
    "we then arrange the two types of units on the lattice , using odp determined by the simulated annealing , and vary the period of the pattern to find the period producing the minimum of the wire length .",
    "below we describe the procedure for both _",
    "stripes _ and _ patches _ in more details .    _",
    "i ) stripes _    to find the optimum period for stripes we use an array containing 300 by 300 units .",
    "this array includes three periods of the stripes , which run parallel to one of the sides of the region .",
    "each period therefore includes 100 units , containing @xmath43 left and @xmath44 right eye units , @xmath45 . by varying @xmath43",
    "we accomplish the change in the filling fraction of the left ( ipsilateral ) eye , according to the formula : @xmath46 .",
    "we consider a string of 100 units at the center of the array , which is representative of all the units in the configuration .",
    "for each of the central units the computer program establishes connections , according to the connection rules .",
    "most of the calculations are done for @xmath47 .",
    "we check that results change for different @xmath48 in a predictable fashion ( see below , results , subsection  [ sp ] ) .",
    "stripes therefore have a fixed period in terms of number of units ( 100 ) . to find the optimal spatial period of the stripes we vary the shape of each elementary cell in the 300 by 300 array . thus , if the rectangular cell dimensions are @xmath49 perpendicular and @xmath50 parallel to the stripes , we vary both @xmath49 and @xmath50 , keeping the area of elementary cell @xmath51 constant . by doing",
    "so we do not change the density of units , but vary the spatial od period , according to the formula @xmath52 . for each value of @xmath49 the cells are reconnected according to the connection rules .",
    "special care is taken about exclusion of the boundary effects by making sure that none of the units on the edges of the array is connected to .",
    "after the optimum period is found the period in terms of number of units is changed from 100 to another value , closer to the value of spatial period , to check for the absence of geometric artifacts , associated with distortions of elementary cells .",
    "the change of the spatial period after this procedure is typically absent but in extreme cases does not exceed 3% .    _ ii ) patches _    since our results indicate that a triangular crystal of _ patches _ is formed ( see fig .",
    "[ phases]j ) , we consider an array in the shape of parallelogram commensurate with the triangular arrangement of _ patches_. the lattice sites in the array , representing units , are also arranged on a triangular lattice .",
    "their positions are given by @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are integers varying between 1 and @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath58 is the period of odp to be optimized .",
    "the centers of _ patches _ are located at points @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "each patch includes lattice sites at the distance from a center determined by the filling fraction of the ipsilateral eye : @xmath61 .",
    "the units within / outside the patch are left / right eye dominated .",
    "the units in the configuration are then represented by the central parallelogram : @xmath62 . for each of the units connections",
    "are made according to the connection rules with @xmath47 .",
    "the optimum period is obtained by varying parameter @xmath58 .      to determine the experimental dependence of the odp period on the filling factor , the image of odp in macaque monkey ( horton and hocking , 1996a )",
    "is converted into a digital format . in this format the image is represented by a set of pixels .",
    "a pixel with coordinates @xmath63 and @xmath64 is represented by a number @xmath65 , equal to @xmath24 for the right eye dominated and @xmath25 for the left eye dominated area . for each position in the image",
    "we then determine the local value of the average filling fraction of the ipsilateral eye and the value of local od period .",
    "both these calculations are similar . to do the calculation at a certain point in the map , given by coordinates @xmath66 , we surround the corresponding pixel by a square , containing @xmath67 pixels ( black square in fig .  [ monkey1 ] , @xmath68 mm ) .",
    "the dimensions of the square are such that one hand it contains a few odp periods ( about 3 ) , which is needed for averaging , and on the other hand it is small compared to the characteristic dimensions over which the properties of odp change ( @xmath69 1 cm , see fig .  [ monkey1 ] ) . to determine the filling fraction we average the scanned image over the square : for position @xmath66 in the map the local value of the average filling fraction is given by @xmath70     , width=297 ]    to determine the local value of odp period we perform the fourier transform of the @xmath71 in the square . as a result",
    "we obtain a set of numbers @xmath72 , representing the fourier transform amplitudes , defined on a @xmath67 set of wave vectors @xmath73 .",
    "the spectral power , represented by @xmath74 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ tf ] for one of the points in the pattern , corresponding to _",
    "stripes_. it clearly has a bimodal appearance , indicating the average in the square direction of the stripes .",
    "we then determine the average value of the wave vector , using the formula : @xmath75    ) .",
    "the spectral power in the scale bar is in arbitrary units .",
    "[ tf ] , width=297 ]    the value of the mean odp period is then defined as @xmath76 this value for each pixel in the shaded area in fig .",
    "[ monkey1 ] is shown in fig .",
    "we start by finding optimal layouts for three illustrative examples of wiring rules with small numbers of connections , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we caution the reader that because of the small numbers of connections phase assignments may seem arbitrary .",
    "these examples are chosen to illustrate our main results which will be confirmed both in the lattice model with large @xmath8 and @xmath9 later in this section and in the continuous model ( chklovskii and koulakov , 2001 ) .",
    "for the first two examples we set equal numbers of left and right dominated neurons , @xmath18 . in the first example each neuron connects with equal numbers of the same - eye and other - eye neurons , @xmath77 . then the optimal layout is the `` chess board '' of left / right neurons , fig.[lat1]a .",
    "this layout is a realization of the _ salt and pepper _ phase , fig.[phases]a , because each neuron has an equal number of left and right neurons among its immediate neighbors . to calculate the length of connections per neuron , @xmath58",
    ", we notice that in this layout all neurons have the same pattern of connections . by considering one of them ,",
    "fig.[lat1]a , we find that @xmath78 .",
    "this layout is optimal because each neuron makes all of its connections with immediate neighbors .     and @xmath77 .",
    "( a ) a realization of the _ salt and pepper _ phase gives minimal wire length ( lattice constants per neuron ) .",
    "( b ) a realization of the _ stripe _ phase is suboptimal ( ) .",
    "[ lat1 ] , width=297 ]    a suboptimal layout for the same wiring rules is illustrated by a realization of the _ stripe _ phase , fig.[lat1]b . in this layout",
    "each neuron has the same pattern of connections up to a mirror reflection . by considering one of them ,",
    "fig.[lat1]b , we find @xmath79 , greater than @xmath80 for the _ salt and pepper _ phase . here",
    "each neuron has among its immediate neighbors only three other - eye neurons , while the wiring rules require connecting with four other - eye neurons .",
    "a connection to a more distant neighbor is longer making the layout suboptimal .",
    "we confirm the optimality of the _ salt and pepper _ phase for @xmath81 for large @xmath8 , @xmath9 both numerically and analytically .     and",
    "@xmath82 , @xmath83 . ( a ) a realization of the _ salt and pepper _ is suboptimal ( ) .",
    "( b ) a realization of the _ stripe _ phase gives minimal wire length ( ) .",
    "[ lat2 ] , width=297 ]    in the second example each neuron connects with more same - eye than other - eye neurons : @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "then a realization of the _ salt and pepper _ phase , fig.[lat2]a is not optimal anymore .",
    "the length of connections per neuron is @xmath84 , while the _ stripe _ phase , fig.[lat2]b gives @xmath80 .",
    "the _ salt and pepper _ phase loses in wiring efficiency because there are not enough same - eye neurons among immediate neighbors and connections with more distant neighbors are needed .",
    "the _ stripe _",
    "phase , fig.[lat2]b rectifies this inefficiency by having each neuron make connections only with immediate neighbors . thus , clustering of same - eye neurons is advantageous if each neuron connects more with the same - eye than with the other - eye neurons .     and",
    "@xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "realizations of the ( a ) _ salt and pepper _ ( ) and ( b ) _ stripes _ ( ) are suboptimal .",
    "( c ) a realization of the _ l - patch _ phase gives minimal wire length ( ) .",
    "[ lat3 ] , width=297 ]    in the third example we use the same wiring rules ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) but take different numbers of left / right neurons , @xmath85 , @xmath86 . the realizations of the _ salt and pepper _ phase is shown in fig.[lat3]a and of the _ stripe _ phase in fig.[lat3]b . in these layouts ,",
    "different neurons have different patterns of connections . to find the wiring length per neuron we average over different patterns and find for the _ salt and pepper _ phase @xmath87 and for the _ stripe _ phase @xmath88 .",
    "a more efficient layout is the _",
    "l - patch _",
    "phase , fig.[lat3]c , where @xmath89 .",
    "although we can not prove that the _ l - patch _ phase is optimal , this seems likely .",
    "thus , the optimal shape of monocular regions depends on the relative numbers of left / right neurons .      after giving some examples of odps with small numbers of connections @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "we discuss the opposite case of large numbers . as we show below in section [ sp ] , the shape of od columns in this case",
    "does not depend on the absolute values of parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it is determined by the ratio @xmath42 and by the relative amount of ipsilateral neurons @xmath16 ( assuming that the left eye is ipsilateral ) .",
    "depending on the values of parameters @xmath42 , and @xmath16 , optimal layout belongs to the one of the eight phases shown in fig .",
    "[ phases ] , where ipsilateral and contralateral - eye dominated neurons are shown by black and white regions respectively .",
    "these phases can be divided into three major classes . the first class is represented by the unsegregated _ salt and pepper _ layout , in which two types of neurons are uniformly intermixed ( figure  [ phases]a ) .",

    "first , it is the sharp _ stripes _ ( figure  [ phases]i ) , which consists of alternating lamellar monocular regions .",
    "second , it is the weakly segregated _ stripes _ ( figure  [ phases]c , e ) . in this odp",
    "the variation of density of left / right eye dominated neurons is small .",
    "this is an intermediate pattern between the unsegregated _ salt an pepper _ and the sharp _ stripe _ layouts .",
    "this phase is therefore fragile and difficult to obtain numerically . in some cases",
    "simulated annealing can produce such a phase , figure  [ phases]e . in the other cases the weak segregated phase",
    "can only be obtained by the perturbation theory , which can carefully account for a weak variation of neuronal density .",
    "such case is shown in figure  [ phases]c .",
    "third , we also obtain _ stripy _ phases that show a tendency to become _ patches _",
    ", by e.g. their longitudinal modulation , such as shown in figure  [ phases]g .",
    "similar subclasses exist among _ patchy _ layouts .",
    "we obtain sharp , weakly segregated ( obtained from simulated annealing or perturbation theory ) , and elongated _ patches _ , which are shown in figures  [ phases]j , f , d , and h respectively . finally , there are mixed phases containing both _ stripes _ and _ patches _ , such as in figure  [ phases]b .",
    "these odp s are shown on the phase diagram ( pd ) in figure  [ phd ] .",
    "the phase diagram shows the optimum phase ( minimizing the total wire length ) for given values of parameters @xmath42 and @xmath16 .    the important feature of the pd is its left - right eye symmetry .",
    "it is apparent from the symmetry of figure  [ phd ] with respect to the line @xmath90 .",
    "this is a consequence of the left - right eye symmetry of our model , implying that the connection rules , defined by numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 are independent on whether a neuron is left or right - eye dominated . for this reason",
    "the phase for @xmath91 can be obtained from the point with the same @xmath42 and the value of the filling fraction equal to @xmath92 .",
    "this corresponds to the replacement of the white regions in figure  [ phases ] by black and vice versa .",
    "a similar correspondence takes place when one compares odp s in left and right hemisphere .     and @xmath42 .",
    "for the color key see figure  [ phases ] .",
    "[ phd ] , width=297 ]    another important feature of the pd is the existence of the _ salt and pepper _ region around the line @xmath93 .",
    "this implies that the difference between @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the driving force of segregation into odp .",
    "the larger the difference , the sharper the odp becomes .",
    "the area of the pd adjacent to @xmath18 is occupied by _",
    "odps . at small values of the filling",
    "fraction the phases are _",
    "patchy_. a transition from _ stripes _ to _ patches _ occurs at @xmath94 almost independently on parameter @xmath42 .",
    "an example of such transition for @xmath95 is shown in figure  [ transition ] .",
    ", width=297 ]    the reasons for the transition for _ small _ values of @xmath96 are discussed in koulakov and chklovskii , 1999 . for _",
    "larger_differences , when odp becomes sharp , the transition occurs due to the presence of surface contribution to the wire length . to demonstrate this we present the following argument , which is rigorously valid in the asymptotic limit of large number of connections to the same - eye neurons , i.e. @xmath97 . in this",
    "limit connections to the same - eye neurons are the most abundant and therefore most costly , from wire length prospective .",
    "hence , we can disregard connections to the opposite - eye neurons in the first approximation .",
    "consider a unit near the interface between two od columns ( top unit in fig .",
    "[ connections ] ) .",
    "the connection arbor of this unit to the same od units , shown by empty circles in fig .",

    "hence , the presence of the interface between the od columns implies an increase in the wirelength , and is therefore associated with a surface cost ( similar to malsburg , 1979 ) .",
    "this surface cost drives the transition from _ stripes _ to _ patches_. indeed if @xmath98 the patchy phases have much shorter length of the surface compared to _ stripes_. this is because _ patches _ shrink when @xmath99 reducing their surface length , whereas _ stripes _ become narrower , keeping their surface length the same .",

    "the conclusion that the _ patch _ phase becomes optimal when contralateral eye dominates is , indeed , non - trivial , because there may be a system of alternating wide and narrow monocular stripes instead .",
    "we test our conclusion on the data from macaque monkey first ( horton and hocking , 1996a ) .",

    "imagine now a geometric transformation , in which the dimensions of the connection arbors of all of the neurons , as well as the od pattern itself , are blown up by the same scaling factor @xmath112 .",

    "the obtained new od pattern and the new connection arbors are shown schematically in fig .",

    "in this work we propose a model which can account for most of experimentally observed features of odps .",
    "our model has two principal parameters .",
    "the first parameter characterizes the intracortical circuitry .",
    "it is the difference between the number of connections to the same and to the opposite od neurons .",
    "our results suggest that this difference is the driving force of segregation into odps .",
    "we argue therefore that the sensitivity of the intra - cortical connectivity to od provides a reason to formation of od columns ( see below ) . the second parameter is the fraction of neurons dominated by the ipsilateral eye .",
    "this parameter determines the shape of monocular regions in odp . in the majority of the primary visual area of macaque and _",
    "cebus _ monkeys this parameter is close to @xmath160 , which implies that both ipsi- and contralateral eyes are equally represented .",
    "however , in the proximity of monocular crescent the ipsilateral eye becomes underrepresented .",
    "this is because the inputs into the eye are blocked by the nose of the animal .",
    "our theory suggests that the decrease in the filling fraction of the ipsilateral eye drives the transition in the odp structure from stripy ( zebra skin like ) to patchy ( similar to leopard skin ) . the transition occurs when the fraction of the ipsilateral eye dominated neurons approaches @xmath0 in both macaque and _ cebus _ monkeys ( see below ) .",
    "we also analyze the dependence of od period on the parameters of our model and find satisfactory agreement with experimental data .",
    "each neuron in our model establishes certain number of intra - cortical connections with neurons dominated by the same and the opposite eye . as suggested by experimental studies in macaque striate cortex",
    ", neurons in layer @xmath1 typically make more connections with neurons of the same od ( katz et al . , 1989 ) .",
    "thus , from wiring economy prospective , connections with neurons of the same od are more important than the opposite eye connections .",
    "therefore , it is advantageous to form od columns , since they provide environment rich with the same od neurons , which results in shortening connections to the same eye neurons .",
    "the wiring economy principle thus provides a natural reason for the existence of od patterns , i.e. answers the first question in the program listed in the introduction .",
    "our model suggests that in primates with weakly defined od columns , such as squirrel monkey ( hubel et al . , 1976 ; livingstone , 1996 ; horton and hocking , 1996b ) and owl monkey ( livingstone , 1996 ) , the difference between these two components of intracortical connectivity is not large .",
    "such difference may be increased in these animals by experimentally induced strabismus . indeed , strabismus reduces correlated activity between opposite od cortical neurons , therefore reducing their connectivity @xmath9 .",
    "reduction in @xmath9 unbalanced by the corresponding reduction in @xmath8 increases the parameter @xmath42 and leads to sharpening of od columns , according to our phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ phd ] . such sharpening",
    "is indeed observed experimentally ( shatz et al . , 1977 ; lowel , 1994 ; livingstone , 1996 ) .",
    "this phenomenon was also predicted theoretically by goodhill ( 1993 ) .",
    "the two parameters of intra - cortical circuitry , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , represent in our model the interplay between two classes of processing performed by the visual cortex .",
    "the first class includes the processing of the monocular image , for which connections to the same od neurons are necessary .",
    "the second class includes various tasks related to stereopsis , which require comparison of two monocular images , relying on the connections between the opposite od neurons .",
    "we proposed above that the function of od columns is to shorten the connections between the same eye neurons",
    ". the impact of stereoscopic vision should therefore be the opposite : strong stereoscopy should make odp weaker .",
    "inversely , weak stereoscopy induces sharp odps .",
    "the latter statement is justified by the observations in animals with experimental strabismus .",
    "however , one should be careful about this statement , since the relation between functional and anatomical properties may not be direct .",
    "the situation in the animals with lateral eye positioning , such as mice , rats , tree shrews , etc . , is different . in such animals",
    "the visual pathway is almost completely crossed , i.e. v1 in each hemisphere is strongly dominated by the contralateral eye [ drager , 1974 , 1975 , 1978 ; drager and olsen , 1980 ; gordon and stryker , 1996 ( mouse ) ; hubel , 1977 ( rat ) ; casagrande and harting , 1975 ; mully and fitzpatrick , 1992 ( tree shrew ) ; horton and hocking , 1996b ( other species ) ] . as suggested by antonini et al .",
    "this implies that the odp contains only two large monocular columns , each spanning the whole hemisphere .",
    "this can be interpreted as an od having very large period , spanning both striate cortices .",
    "this picture can be fitted into the framework of our model .",
    "indeed , we predict that if the number of connections to the other od neurons ( @xmath9 ) is very small the od has a very large period ( fig.[fs ] ) .",
    "thus our model predicts that the number of connections received by each neuron from the neurons of the same od ( @xmath8 ) is much larger than the number of opposite eye connections ( @xmath9 ) in the species with lateral eye positioning .",
    "this should include the cross - hemispheric projections .",
    "this statement should have functional consequences . since @xmath9 is small , synthesis of images from two eyes is weaker .",
    "therefore the animals have to find another strategy to implement stereopsis .",
    "hooded rats for example use vertical head movements to estimate distances ( legg and lambert , 1990 ) .",
    "our conclusion about small @xmath9 should also apply to the superior colliculus in these animals ( colonnese and constantine - paton , 2001 ) , as well as to the tectum in lower vertebrates ( schmidt and tieman , 1985 ) , in which cases the visual inputs cross over almost completely too .",
    "to summarize , our model encompasses most of the phenomena related to the sharpness and observability of odp .",
    "it relates the interspecies variability in the odp to the relative amount of binocular interaction occurring in different species .",
    "thus , we predict , that in the animals with weakly segregated columns ( squirrel monkey ) @xmath40 ; in the animals with sharp columns ( macaque ) @xmath8 is much larger than @xmath9 [ confirmed by katz et al . , ( 1989 ) ] ; and , finally , in the animals with lateral eye positioning , @xmath9 should have a value , whose contribution to the wirelength can be neglected .",
    "another consequence of a decreasing @xmath16 in macaque is a decrease in the odp period ( levay et al . , 1985 ) .",
    "in fig .  [ fp ]",
    "we compare the result of our theory to the data from macaque monkey ( fourier transform applied to data from horton and hocking , 1996a ) . from this comparison",
    "we conclude that , according to the wiring economy principle , parameter @xmath161 , or cells establish much more connection with the same od cells , than with the opposite .",
    "this result of is consistent with the observations of od sensitive circuitry in the striate cortex of macaque by katz et al .",
    "( 1989 ) .",
    "we chose the regions proximal to the horizontal meridian for this comparison .",
    "this is based on the assumption that cortical properties , such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , change little along this meridian .",
    "this assumption is in part supported by the fact that od periodicity changes little on the large segment of the meridian occupied by stripes , spanning the region between about 2 and 25 degree eccentricity ( notice very little scatter in fig .",
    "[ fp ] around the point @xmath90 ) .",
    "the changes in the period begin to occur when @xmath16 deviates from @xmath19 .",

    "such variation can not be accounted for by a decrease in parameter @xmath16 alone , since @xmath16 is about @xmath19 on both meridians in close proximity to parafoveal region ( < 20 degrees of eccentricity ) .",
    "our model suggests two possibilities based on the variation in the intracortical circuitry , described by @xmath8 and @xmath9 . since such differences in the circuitry",
    "may also be responsible for variability of the od period between different animals , we discuss this possibility in the next subsection .",
    "studies in macaque monkeys ( horton and hocking , 1996a ) reveal large inter - individual variability of the stripe period .",
    "the stripe period is @xmath162 along the v1 border , after comparison of 6 animals .",
    "two factors may contribute to this phenomenon in the framework of our model .",
    "( 1 ) the basic diameter of axonal and dendritic arbors @xmath123 varies from animal to animal .",
    "this could be due to changes in @xmath8 , @xmath9 , or neuronal density .",
    "( 2 ) the ratio between monocular and binocular interactions @xmath42 varies .",
    "the former reason is justified by eq .  ( [ scalab_form ] ) .",
    "the latter can be understood from fig .",
    "simply speaking , monocular interactions ( @xmath8 ) favor formation of od columns , making them wider , in an effort to provide same od rich environment for all the neurons .",
    "binocular interactions ( @xmath9 ) favor interfaces between columns , since interfaces bring opposite od neurons closer to each other .",
    "they therefore decrease od period .",
    "when @xmath42 increases the od period increases too ( fig .",
    "this may occur when comparing different individuals .",
    "similar consideration may apply to the experiments in strabismic animals ( lowel , 1994 ; livingstone , 1996 ) . since strabismus reduces correlations between eyes , its effect in our model",
    "is to reduce parameter @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the ratio @xmath42 is increased . according to our model ( fig .",
    "[ fs ] ) this generally leads to an increase in the relative od period ( ratio of the basic od periodicity to the connection range @xmath123 ) .",
    "this result is understood from the interplay between affinity between the same eye neurons ( @xmath8 ) , increasing the period , and the affinity between opposite od neurons ( @xmath9 ) , reducing od period . since the latter is reduced by strabismus",
    ", the od period grows .",
    "the degree of the period change depends on the decrease in the number of interocular connection , and is difficult to estimate .",
    "a curious feature displayed by od period in our model is an abrupt increase at @xmath163 by a factor of about @xmath136 , cf .",
    "this implies that close to point @xmath164 the od period may be very sensitive to developmental manipulations .",
    "this finding may have correlate in squirrel monkey , for which the observed increase in period is by a factor @xmath165 ( horton and hocking , 1996b ) .",
    "these data are obtained from comparison to a single strabismic animal .",
    "the following scenario is possible , comparing squirrel monkey to the strabismus experiments in owl monkey ( livingstone , 1996 ) , in which no significant increase in periodicity is observed .",
    "parameter @xmath42 in squirrel monkey passes the point @xmath164 due to strabismus , leading to the substantial increase in period . in owl monkey parameter",
    "@xmath42 is above @xmath166 in normal animal .",
    "strabismus therefore has little effect .",
    "this scenario is consistent with sharper od columns in normal owl monkeys ( @xmath167 ) than in normal squirrel monkeys ( @xmath168 ) ( livingstone , 1996 ; horton and hocking , 1996b ) .",
    "experimentally induced strabismus in cat leads to an increase in the od period by a factor of @xmath169 ( lowel , 1994 ; goodhill , 1993 ; see however jones et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "our model suggests that parameter @xmath167 in cat , and the increase in the period is due to the smooth part of the dependence in fig .",
    "[ fs ] , which may not be so substantial as in squirrel monkey .",
    "the relevance of wiring economy principle to the neuronal spatial organization can be illustrated by the following thought experiment ( koulakov and chklovskii , 2001 ) .",
    "imagine taking a cortical area and scrambling neurons in that area , while keeping all the connections between neurons the same .",
    "since the circuit is unchanged , the functional properties of the neurons remain intact .",
    "therefore , from the functional point of view , the scrambled region is identical to the original one .",
    "in fact , the only difference caused by scrambling is in the length of neuronal connections .",
    "therefore , it is hard ( if not impossible ) to justify the existence of systematic cortical maps , such as od pattern , without invoking the cost of making long neuronal connections .",
    "although some theories of map formation may not explicitly mention the wiring optimization principle , it is present implicitly , usually in requiring the locality of intra - cortical connections .",
    "how important is the constraint imposed by wiring minimization ? in principle",
    "one can imagine development of an organism , which has 30% excess of wire with respect to the existing ones .",
    "it turns out that the existence of such an organism is close to impossible .",
    "indeed , imagine that an external object , such as a blood vessel , is introduced in certain area of the gray matter .",
    "in this case some of the neuronal connection have to go around the vessel , therefore increasing in length .",
    "if the nerve pulses are to be delivered at the original speed and/or intensity , the elongated axons and dendrites have to be made thicker , to increase the pulse propagation speed and decrease dendritic attenuation .",
    "this leads to more obstacles on the way of other neuronal connections and so on .",
    "thus , introduction of a new blood vessel leads to an infinite series of axonal and dendritic reconstructions .",
    "the same is true about the extra connection volume , resulting from wasteful neuronal positioning .",
    "such infinite series of reconstructions can diverge , which implies that the connection volume resulting from more and more reconstructions increases indefinitely . in this case",
    "the new blood vessel can never be inserted without sacrificing significantly the brain function .",
    "it turns out that mammalian brain has reached the verge of this so called _ wiring catastrophe _ ( chklovskii and stevens , 2001 ) , so that it gets increasingly more difficult to accommodate excess volume in the nerve tissues .",
    "the wiring catastrophe occurs when the fraction of axons and dendrites in the cortical volume reaches @xmath170 .",
    "electron microscopy studies of cortical slices show that the actual volume occupied by neuronal processes is about @xmath171 ( chklovskii and stevens , 2001 ) .",
    "the brain therefore has approached the barrier imposed by wiring catastrophe .",
    "further increase of the volume fraction of neuronal processed may deteriorate the brain function .      as discussed in the previous subsection ,",
    "wiring optimization is the only known way to relate neuronal layout ( as manifested in the odp ) to the statistics of neuronal connectivity .",
    "models of the odp development that do not explicitly rely on wiring optimization invoke it implicitly , usually requiring the locality of intra - cortical connections .      in his pioneering work ,",
    "mitchison ( 1991 ) studied a question whether odp minimize the wiring volume relative to the _ salt and pepper _ layout .",
    "he assumed that the inter- neuronal connectivity is determined both by ocular dominance and retinotopy with all neurons having the same connectivity rules .",
    "he found that the answer to this question depends on the detailed assumptions about axonal branching rules .",
    "in particular it depends on the value of axonal branching exponent @xmath157 .",
    "he has shown that if all axonal segments have the same caliber ( @xmath172 ) , than odp s are indeed advantageous for certain range of ratios of same - eye to opposite - eye connections .",
    "he also showed that if @xmath173 than the odp do not save wiring volume relative to _ salt and pepper_. however , existing data seems to suggest that axonal caliber branches with @xmath173 ( deschenes and landry 1980 , adal and barker , 1965 ) .",
    "the case of axonal branching with the cross - sectional area conservation corresponds closely to our model because we require a separate connection for each neuron . the reason we find that odp minimize wiring length is because we drop the retinotopy requirement on inter - neuronal connection rules , an assumption supported by the experimental data ( katz ) .",
    "although , effectively connections are roughly retinotopic , connection rules may vary from neuron to neuron thus providing some flexibility .",
    "the advantage of our approach is its simplicity allowing us to map out a complete phase diagram and make experimentally testable predictions .",
    "the full theory of the odp will require a detailed analysis of axonal branching which must rely on better knowledge of axonal branching rules .",
    "jones et al .",
    "( 1991 ) proposed an explanation for why odp have either stripy or patchy appearance .",
    "they assumed that neurons are already segregated into the odp ( by considering units whose size equals the width of monocular regions ) and found that the difference between stripy and patchy appearances of the odp could be due to the boundary conditions , i.e. different shape of v1 in different species .",
    "although the correlation between the shape of v1 and the odp layout is observed , the model of jones et al .",
    "does not explain why peripheral representation of macaque v1 has patchy odp or why ocular dominance stripes run perpendicular to the long axis of v1 in some parts of v1 but not in others .",
    "moreover , it is the local structure of odp that is likely to determine the shape of v1 and not the other way around .",
    "therefore , unlike jones et al .",
    ", our work proposes a unified theory of odp including _ salt and pepper _ , stripy and patchy layouts , and is based on local inter - neuronal connectivity rules .    another model related to wiring length minimization is the elastic net model studied by goodhill and coworkers ( 1993 ) .",
    "the original formulation of the model minimized the cost function which penalized for placing nearby neurons whose activity is not correlated , a choice justified by computational convenience .",
    "later the elastic model was generalized by the introduction of a c measure .",
    "maximization of c measure effectively corresponds to penalizing for placing correlated neurons far apart . unlike wiring optimization",
    "the penalty does not increase beyond a distance called cortical interaction . because of this , elastic net often yields solutions where left and right eye neurons are completely segregated into left and right eye maps .",
    "our wiring optimization models can be viewed as a sub - set of models described by c measure .",
    "the advantage of our wiring optimization approach is that it has a transparent biological justification for the cost of placing neurons far from each other - the cost of wiring . because of this , wiring optimization is a natural choice for questions related to the anatomy of intra - cortical connections .",
    "wiring optimization provides a link between neuronal connectivity and spatial layout .",
    "thus , it leaves open the connection between connectivity and computational function . unlike most other models , which assume that neurons should be connected only if they are correlated , wiring optimization makes other assumptions about connectivity possible , for example connecting neurons with anti - correlated firing .",
    "our theory relates functional requirements on the neuronal circuits to its structural properties . in particular",
    ", our model relates the amounts of the neuronal intraocular and interocular interactions , and the filling fraction of ipsilateral neurons , to the structure of the ocular dominance pattern .",
    "we conclude that the interspecies variability in the ocular dominance patterns may be explained by differences in the underlying cortical circuitry .",
