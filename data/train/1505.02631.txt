    "pars experimental station is planned on the soon - to - be - built vela / clara beam line in the daresbury laboratories as shown in fig.[fig : layout ] @xcite .",
    "pars will receive an @xmath0mev electron beam with a flexible parameter range .",
    "this will allow the station to conduct wide range systematic studies on electron driven plasma wakefield acceleration .",
    "program aims to explore single and two - beam operation .",
    "the former aims to study maximum achievable accelerating gradient and head - to - tail acceleration with a single electron bunch . whereas the latter aims to demonstrate the acceleration of a witness or trailing bunch .",
    "numerical studies reported in this paper were performed by using vsim @xcite .",
    "the maximum achievable accelerating gradient was studied for different bunch length and radius values between @xmath1 m and @xmath2 m , respectively , considering a @xmath0mev electron bunch with a charge of @xmath0pc .",
    "higher wakefields of @xmath3gv / m for a tightly focused drive beam ( @xmath4 m ) , and @xmath5mv / m for more realistic beam sizes are possible within the bunch length range between @xmath1 m ( fig.[fig : density_scan ] ) .",
    "the achieved field gradient is proportional to the plasma density and after a certain density it scales inversely proportional to the squared bunch length as predicted by the linear theory eq.[eqn : linear_theory ] , @xmath6 where n is the density of background plasma electrons and @xmath7 is the bunch length .",
    "mm propagation.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    a realistic case of @xmath8 m bunch length and @xmath9 m bunch radius which yields @xmath10mv / m gradient for single bunch propagated @xmath11 mm at a plasma density of @xmath12 was selected for further studies in this paper .",
    "a two - beam scenario was simulated using the baseline case detailed above . a second bunch of same sizes but with a certain fraction of the drive bunch charge",
    "was initially placed half a plasma wavelength ( @xmath13 ) behind the centre of the driver bunch . the maximum energy gain and the minimum energy spread of the trailing bunch",
    "was found to occur between @xmath14 m and @xmath15 m behind the driver bunch as shown in fig.[fig : energy_distance ] .",
    ".,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the initial two beam configuration shown in fig.[fig : beam_profiles]-(a ) was tracked along a @xmath16 m long plasma column .",
    "fig.[fig : beam_profiles]-(b ) shows the beam profiles evolved after @xmath17 m reaching an energy of @xmath18 with a @xmath19 energy spread .",
    "energy spread control is under study through beam loading and bunch profile manipulation .",
    "a `` fish - bone '' structure starts forming in the driver bunch and both bunches are transversely focused where there is no significant bunch length change .",
    "2d field distribution for the two - beam case is given in fig.[fig:2d_field ] with accelerating blue region and decelerating red region .",
    "+         +    m propagation with the hint of beam loading .",
    "oval shapes represent bunches of different species on their respective locations with the same colour code as the curves.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    plasma wakefields consist of co - existing transverse and longitudinal fields as they are induced due to the motion of the plasma electrons in both directions .",
    "the transverse field accompanying the above longitudinal field is shown in fig.[fig : foc_field]-(a ) as a 2d intensity map .",
    "the transverse fields generally have a comparable field strength to the longitudinal fields ( fig.[fig : foc_field]-(b ) ) and they might act as focusing fields depending on the phase of the trailing bunch .",
    "it has been observed that in the presence of a second bunch the resulting field in the region is modified by the self electromagnetic field of this bunch .",
    "this phenomena is similar to the `` beam loading '' in the rf cavities .",
    "the position of the second beam can be adjusted so that the beam loading effect can be used , in favour of the scheme , in a way to reduce the energy spread on the second bunch by adjusting the field gradient across it . such a scan was performed by moving the trailing bunch around its initial location at @xmath13 .",
    "effect of the beam loading on controlling the energy spread is shown in fig.[fig : energy_distance ] previously .",
    "this phenomenon was demonstrated in fig.[fig : beam_loading ] in more detail for the trailing bunch locations providing the highest final energies for each case .",
    "longitudinal plasma wakefield components in the presence of a single bunch and two bunch cases with different trailing beam charges are presented .    as seen in the figure ,",
    "the absolute values and the shape of the first bucket located about @xmath20 m are modified for different charges of the trailing bunch .",
    "beam loading is larger for a trailing bunch carrying @xmath21 of the drive bunch and the a plateau is formed leading to a @xmath22 smaller energy spread compared to the case where the trailing bunch has @xmath23 of the drive beam charge . the cause of the modification is both the charge difference and the fact that the locations of trailing bunches are @xmath24 m apart from each other for presented cases .",
    "this effect is under further optimisation .",
    "the novelty of the experimental study of plasma wakefields brings the necessity of employing and developing the novel measurement techniques for both plasma and the beam .    in pars",
    "experimental station we aim to implement various measurement techniques such as optical transmission radiation interference ( otri ) technique @xcite , coherent diffraction radiation ( cdr ) monitoring @xcite , electro - optical sampling ( eos ) @xcite etc . for the electron beams and plasma diagnostics to measure beam sizes and densities . a double - magnet magnetic spectrometer with a segmented beam dump",
    "is being studied to demonstrate the feasibility to measure a wide range of energies with an adequate energy resolution @xcite .",
    "a summary of feasibility studies for an electron driven plasma wakefield acceleration test facility is given in this paper . given the realistic beam parameters , primarily an acceleration gradient of @xmath5mv / m is aimed to be experimentally demonstrated .",
    "the beam loading effect was studied and promising results were obtained towards the control of the energy spread of the trailing bunch . a @xmath22 improvement is shown in this paper , further studies considering different drive and trailing bunch profiles are in progress in order to optimise the transformer ratio and energy spread .    alongside with plasma acceleration studies , plasma lensing effect will be tested as well , which is reported elsewhere @xcite .",
