    "carbone et al .",
    "determined that the scaling relations can better fit the data if the relations are phenomenologically modified to account for compressibility .",
    "the incorporation of weakly compressional density fluctuations was partially addressed by so - called nearly incompressible models , which expand the compressible equations with respect to small sonic mach number ( matthaeus and brown @xcite , zank and matthaeus @xcite ) and which were recently formulated in the presence of a static large - scale inhomogeneous background ( hunana and zank @xcite , hunana et al .",
    "@xcite , see also bhattacharjee et al .",
    "these models however specifically assume , and can not explain , why the solar wind is only weakly compressible .",
    "the theoretical compressible mhd models developed in the wave turbulence formalism ( e.g. kuznetsov @xcite , chandran @xcite ) also can not address this issue .    describing the solar wind with fully compressible mhd or hall - mhd formalisms yields several problems .",
    "most importantly , these compressible descriptions introduce sound waves and slow magnetosonic waves .",
    "as elaborated by howes @xcite , slow magnetosonic waves are strongly damped by landau damping in the kinetic maxwell - vlasov description .",
    "the presence of fast and slow magnetosonic waves naturally implies higher level of compressibility and overestimates the parallel energy transfer . also , numerical simulations of compressible hall - mhd performed by servidio et al .",
    "@xcite in the context of the magnetopause boundary layer showed that compared to the usual turbulence in compressible mhd simulations , which consists of alfvn waves , the hall term is responsible for decoupling of magnetic and velocity field fluctuations . in compressible hall - mhd regime ,",
    "servidio et al . observed spontaneous generation of magnetosonic waves which transform to a regime of quasi perpendicular `` magnetosonic turbulence '' .",
    "this is in contrast with observational studies which typically show that turbulence in the solar wind predominantly consists of quasi perpendicular ( kinetic ) alfvn waves ( e.g. , bale et al .",
    "@xcite , sahraoui et al .",
    "@xcite ) . finally , all usual mhd or hall - mhd models can not address how the energy is actually dissipated at small scales .",
    "it is well known that solar wind plasma is almost collisionless and therefore the classical von karman picture of energy being dissipated via viscosity is not applicable to the solar wind .",
    "it is evident that new and more realistic models have to be introduced which can overcome some of these drawbacks .",
    "the most realistic approach is of course the fully kinetic vlasov - maxwell description .",
    "it is however analytically intractable , and even the biggest kinetic simulations can not resolve the large - scale turbulence dynamics .",
    "two leading approaches appear to be promising to substitute mhd in describing solar wind turbulence : gyrokinetics and landau fluids .",
    "gyrokinetics ( e.g. schekochihin et al .",
    "@xcite , howes et al .",
    "@xcite ) was originally developed for simulations of fusion in tokamaks .",
    "it is a kinetic - like description , which averages out the gyro - rotation of particles around a mean magnetic field and therefore makes the kinetic description more tractable , mostly by eliminating fast time scales .",
    "derived directly from the kinetic theory , gyrokinetics has a crucial advantage of being asymptotically correct .",
    "landau fluid description , on the other hand , is a fluid - like extension of compressible hall - mhd , in which wave dissipation is incorporated kinetically by the modeling of linear landau damping , thus retaining a realistic sink of energy .",
    "other linear kinetic effects such as finite larmor radius corrections are also incorporated .",
    "the simplest landau fluid closure was considered by hammett and perkins @xcite and the associated dispersion relations were numerically explored by jayanti , goldstein and vias @xcite .",
    "the landau fluid model was further advanced by snyder , hammett and dorland @xcite , who considered the largest mhd scales , starting from the guiding center kinetic equation .",
    "the approach was reconsidered and refined to its present form with incorporation of hall term and finite larmor radius ( flr ) corrections by passot , sulem , goswami and bugnon @xcite .",
    "this landau fluid approach starts with the vlasov - maxwell equations and derives nonlinear evolution equations for density , velocity and gyrotropic pressures . in the simplest formulation",
    "the model is closed at the level of heat fluxes by matching with the linear kinetic theory in the low frequency limit .",
    "kinetic expressions usually contain the plasma dispersion function which is not suitable for fluid - like simulations .",
    "landau fluid closure is therefore performed in a way as to minimize occurrences of this plasma dispersion function and , where not possible , this function is replaced by a pad approximant .",
    "this eliminates the time non - locality and also results in the presence of a hilbert transform with respect to the longitudinal coordinate ( in the direction of the ambient magnetic field ) which in the fluid formalism is associated with linear landau damping .",
    "further details about the development of landau fluid models are thoroughly discussed in the papers cited above .",
    "the landau fluid approach should however be contrasted with the more classical gyrofluid models ( e.g. dorland and hammett @xcite , brizard @xcite , scott @xcite ) , which are derived by taking fluid moments of the gyrokinetic equation and for which a similar closure scheme is applied afterwards .",
    "the landau fluid approach has the following advantages .",
    "in contrast with hall - mhd , it contains separate equations for parallel and perpendicular pressures and heat fluxes .",
    "it therefore allows for the development of temperature anisotropy , which is observed in the solar wind .",
    "noticeably , in contrast with gyrokinetics or gyrofluid models , the landau fluid model does not average out the fast waves . compared with these approaches , it also has an advantage in that the final equations including the flr corrections are written for the usual quantities measured in the laboratory frame .",
    "existing spectral mhd and hall - mhd codes can therefore be modified to landau fluid description relatively easily . also importantly , even though gyrokinetics is a reduced kinetic description , it is still 5-dimensional and therefore naturally quite difficult to compute . while current largest numerical simulations of gyrokinetics ( howes et al .",
    "@xcite ) require thousands cpu - cores for a fluid - like @xmath0 resolution , the flr - landau fluid model requires computational power only slightly larger than the usual hall - mhd simulations .",
    "the results presented here , which employ a resolution of @xmath1 grid points in all three directions , were calculated using 32 cpu - cores .",
    "landau fluid models can be developed with several levels of complexity .",
    "for these first landau fluid simulations of three dimensional turbulence , we use a simplified version of the most general landau fluid model @xcite , where we constrain ourselves to isothermal electrons and leading order corrections in terms of the ratio of the ion larmor radius to the considered scales .",
    "a similar model was used by borgogno et al .",
    "@xcite , who studied the dynamics of parallel propagating alfvn waves in a medium with an inhomogeneous density profile .",
    "they numerically showed that the observed alfvn wave filamentation and later transition to the regime of dispersive phase mixing is consistent with particle - in - cell simulations . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on freely decaying turbulence and compare these to simulations of compressible hall - mhd .",
    "numerical integration of the full landau fluid model in one space dimension was presented by borgogno et al .",
    "@xcite , who investigated the dynamics very close to the mirror instability threshold and showed the presence of magnetic holes .",
    "results considering quasi - transverse one - dimensional propagation in the full landau fluid model are presented in @xcite .",

    "the model used for the simulations presented here has several limitations .",
    "first of all , it contains electrons which are assumed isothermal , a regime in fact often assumed in hybrid simulations which provide a kinetic description of the ions and a fluid description of the electrons . in the future , more realistic simulations will be performed with inclusion of independent evolution equations for parallel and perpendicular electron pressures and heat fluxes .",
    "this will also result in the presence of electron landau damping , which is absent in the model presented here and which seems to play an important role in solar wind turbulence .",

    "to clearly understand how the landau damping acts in the present system ( 1)-(12 ) , it is useful to solve dispersion relations for linear waves propagating in parallel direction to the ambient magnetic field .",

    "naturally collapses to the solution ( [ eq : zeroalfven ] ) .",
