    "a 2.5 l batch of ndls based on nd carboxilate ( nd - cbx ) having a nd concentration ( [ nd ] ) of 6.5",
    "g / l has been prepared in spring 2008 starting from a concentrated master solution ( [ nd ] @xmath3 50 g / l ) prepared in december 2007 .",
    "the adopted nd concentration is the result of a trade - off between the nd target mass , the light yield and the attenuation length of the doped ls .",
    "the choice of the carboxylic acid , the proper reagent purification procedures as well as the nd - cbx solid salt synthesis and drying recipe , are the results of a r&d activity carried on in the years 2006 - 2007 and are a follow - up of the know - how developed in our working group to produce large quantities of stable and highly performing metal ( gd and in ) loaded liquid scintillators . the ability in producing highly nd concentrated master solution allows to easily produce ndls batches of several tens of liters in a chemical research laboratory environment .    the light yield ( ly ) of the prepared ndls and of the reference ls ( pseudocumene based ) , both using ppo as primary fluor at concentration of 1.5",
    "g / l , was measured in small cylindrical vials ( 5 ml ) , optically coupled to a pmt window by silicon grease .",
    "the vials were wrapped by teflon tape to improve the light collection . as reference",
    "the ly of pc with the same fluor concentration , measured in the same vial , is adopted ( @xmath3 10000 ph / mev ) .",
    "the vial is irradiated by a @xmath4cs source ( e@xmath5 = 662 kev ) .",
    "the measured ly values come from the comparison of the ndls to the reference ls compton spectra as shown in fig.[ly small vial ] .",

    "the optical characterization of the 2.5 l ndls batch is completed by a spectrophotometric measurement of the light absorption spectra in the relevant wavelength range ( 300450 nm ) and by fluorimetric measurement of the light emission spectra .",
    "a challenge is the presence of nd characteristic absorption bands , and of other colored rare earths that usually come with nd , in the wavelength region where pmts quantum efficiency is maximal ; this cause scintillation light loss .",
    "for this reason , particular attention has been put on the purification from optically active and from radioactive contaminants in view of the specific scientific application ( 0@xmath6 decay search ) . adopting our reagent purification procedure , we are able to obtain a transparent region around 400  nm as shown in fig.[assorbanza e emissione ] . in the same figure ,",
    "the emission spectra of ndls prepared with the same concentrations of either ppo or bpo as primary fluors , are superimposed ; the emission spectra match quite well the ndls transparent region .",
    "besides the measurements described above we have also performed , starting in spring 2008 , tests with a 1-m long rectangular quartz cell filled with scintillator",
    ". the cell has been filled first with undoped pc - based ( ls ) scintillator ( pc , [ ppo]=1.5 g / l ) as reference , then with ndls ( nd - cbx in pc , [ nd]=6.5 g / l , [ ppo]=1.5 g / l,[msb]= 30",
    "the goal is to measure on a few liters scale :    * the light yield to be compared to the value obtained from several milliliters samples * to measure the attenuation length which is a fundamental parameter for any application of the ndls .",
    "the cell is equipped with two 3-inch photomultipliers ( pmts ) optically coupled to the quartz by silicon grease at the two end sides .",
    "the cell is wrapped with a vm2000 sheet to increase the light collection .",
    "the two pmts are put in coincidence and their charge values are stored .",
    "the cell is irradiated , scanning it along its main axis , by a collimated 100  kbq @xmath4cs source . for each source position",
    ", we build up the compton spectrum for each pmt ; the half - height of the compton shoulder , @xmath7 , is used to compare data with and without the nd .",
    "the scintillator light attenuation length is then estimated , plotting the quantity @xmath7 against the relative distance to one pmt and fitting with the function : @xmath8 the first term reproduces the direct light collection , relevant close to the pmts , while the second the light collection attenuated by the ndls . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are unknowns and determined from the data . in fig .",

    "[ pc2008 ] and [ nd2008 ] we show the results of measurements performed in 2008 with and without nd , respectively . when fitting the data sets with the function ( [ funzione fit ] ) , we determine :    @xmath11    @xmath12    distribution of @xmath7 for both pmts against the relative distance to pmt2 ( see text for detailes ) for ls wiht nd .",

    "as the borexino grade pc ls attenuation length is known to be of the order of @xmath38 m  @xcite , and we measure it to be @xmath38 m when measuring by spectrophotometry in 10 cm long cell prior the 1 m cell pc filling , it is evident that the value obtained from the 1 m cell measurements is affected by geometric effects related to light propagation .",
    "therefore to extract the ndls light attenuation length from our data we adopt the following procedure :    1 .",
    "we normalize the ndls @xmath7 to the pc @xmath7 and we plot it as a function of the pmt to source distance .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fitpcnorm ] .",
    "the exponential decay trend can now be attributed to the light absorbance of the ndls .",
    "we determine the effective cell optical path taking into account the light reflection at the external quartz surface : after equalizing in timing and in amplitude the pmt signals when the source is placed at the cell central position , we then move the source at one end . from pmt signal timing measurements we can evaluate the effective optical path which turns out to be 1.56 m. 3 .",
    "we correct the geometrical pmt to source distance for the actual optical path .    when doing this , the data scale as shown in fig .",

    "the fitting of the rescaled data set leads to an attenuation length of @xmath13  cm for our ndls at [ nd]= 6.5",

    "[ fitndls2009 ] we plot the quantity @xmath7 evaluated in 2009 spectra as a function of the source distance from each pmt ; the only operation done on the ndls prior to the measurements was nitrogen sparging to remove the oxygen that unavoidably entered in the cell , as the cell sealing is not guaranteed along such a long time .",
    "it is relevant to add that the laboratory where the cell was stored along the year was not air conditioned , therefore the temperature reached quite high values ( @xmath335@xmath14c along the summer months ) .",
    "the fitted uncorrected , for actual optical cell path and light propagation effects , @xmath15 value is found to be 87@xmath163 cm to be compared with 74@xmath163 cm fitted from the may 2008 data set ; therefore we can state that the scintillator is stable along the observation period .     for both pmts against the relative distance to pmt2 ( see text for detailes ) .",
    "2009 data .",
    "[ fitndls2009],scaledwidth=60.0% ]    to determine the light yield , we compute the quantity : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the charge of an event , @xmath19 is the light yield ( p.e./mev ) , @xmath20 the length of the cell and @xmath15 effective attenuation length for the 1-m cell .",
    "then we plot it as a function of the source position taking as reference pmt2 as shown in fig .",
    "[ pcndls ] .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the ratio : @xmath21 the ratio in eq  ( [ eqno2 ] ) allows to determine the ly in the ndls relative to that of the undoped ls , that is by how much the nd reduces the scintillation light .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ pcndls ] , where it can be seen that the ndls reduces by @xmath325% the light yield of the pure ls .",
