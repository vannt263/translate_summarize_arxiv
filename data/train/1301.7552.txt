    "intracules are two - particle density distributions obtained from the spinless second - order reduced density matrix @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the @xmath4-particle position wave function",
    ". intracules are usually normalized to the number of particle pairs @xmath5 .",
    "the seminal intracule is the position intracule @xmath6 which was introduced long ago by coulson and neilson @xcite to study correlation effects in the helium atom . in , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the angular part of @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 gives the probability density for finding two particles separated by a distance @xmath12 and has been widely studied @xcite .    the corresponding momentum intracule @xcite is @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the angular part of @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 gives the probability density for finding two particles moving with a relative momentum @xmath19 .",
    "starting with the wigner distribution @xcite , one can construct a family of intracules @xcite , which provide two - electron position and/or momentum information . within this family ,",
    "the patriarch is the omega intracule @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dynamical angle between the vector @xmath10 and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath22 can be interpreted as the _",
    "joint quasi_-probability density for @xmath12 , @xmath19 and @xmath23 .",
    "the _ quasi _ prefix emphasizes that @xmath22 is not a rigorous probability density and , indeed , it may take negative values @xcite .",
    "based on the observation of rassolov @xcite that both relative position and relative momentum are important to describe the correlation between pairs of electrons , and because the omega intracule contains information on both quantities , @xmath22 has been extensively used in intracule functional theory ( ift ) @xcite .",
    "appropriate integrations @xcite reduce the omega intracule to lower - order intracules such as @xmath11 , @xmath18 and the angle intracule @xcite @xmath24 which provides information on the angle @xmath23 between @xmath10 and @xmath17 .",
    "a similar reduction yields the dot intracule @xcite @xmath25 the variable @xmath26 combines information on the relative position and momentum of the particles , and it is easy to show that it gives the rate of change of @xmath27 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath28 in this way , @xmath29 sheds light on the motion of the electrons .",
    "for example , @xmath30 implies that the electrons are moving in such a way that their separation is constant .",
    "this could arise , for example , if they were in a circular orbit around their centre of mass .",
    "although @xmath31 is usually a non - negative function and has proven useful for understanding electronic behaviour @xcite and for estimating electron correlation energies in atomic and molecular systems @xcite , its connection to the omega suggests that it is not a rigorous probability density .",
    "however , in the following section , we show how to derive the _ exact _",
    "probability distribution of @xmath29 .",
    "we define the posmom intracule @xmath0 to be the exact probability density for the variable @xmath32 .",
    "it is the two - particle version of the posmom density @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xcite and , as we have argued that @xmath35 describes particle trajectories , we now propose that @xmath29 likewise characterizes pair trajectories .    the quantum mechanical operator @xmath36 is known to be an unbounded self - adjoint operator @xcite and its two - particle equivalent is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the gradient operator .",
    "both @xmath39 and @xmath40 correspond to quantum mechanical observables .",
    "following the same approach used in  @xcite to obtain @xmath33 from @xmath39 , one can show that the posmom intracule can be expressed as the fourier transform @xmath41 of the two - particle hyperbolic autocorrelation function @xmath42 this expression can be simplified after defining the intracule density matrix @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the extracule vector , and yields @xmath45    in an entirely analogous way , the dot intracule can be expressed as the fourier transform @xmath46 of the @xmath47-dot function @xcite @xmath48 and the latter can be reduced to @xmath49    comparing with and the taylor expansion of the exponential function @xmath50 reveals that the probability density @xmath31 derived from the wigner distribution is a first - order approximation to the exact density @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the quasi - intracule is correct to @xmath51 and becomes exact in the classical limit @xmath52 .",
    "remarkably , one can construct the exact density from the approximate density using the mapping @xmath53    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]      posmom intracule for states of the he atom : @xmath54 (  ) , @xmath55 ( - - - ) , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 ( - @xmath59 - ) , @xmath60 ( - @xmath59 @xmath59 -).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we have calculated the hf posmom intracule for several excited states of the he atom using a gaussian basis of 36 @xmath35-type functions with exponents @xmath61 and 31 @xmath62-type functions with exponents @xmath63 . the maximum overlap method ( mom ) has been employed for finding excited - state solutions to the hf self - consistent field equations @xcite .",
    "the intracules in the ground state ( @xmath54 ) and four excited states ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath58 and @xmath60 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hees ] . table [ tab : x0he ] lists the values of @xmath64 for these and other excited states .",
    "when the electron pair occupies a more diffuse orbital , @xmath0 becomes broader and @xmath64 drops from 0.206 in the @xmath65 state to @xmath66 in the @xmath67 state , and to @xmath68 for the @xmath69 state .",
    "the decrease is even more marked when the electrons occupy orbitals in different shells , such as in the @xmath55 state where @xmath70 .",
    "however , if the two orbitals have the same principal quantum number , such as in the @xmath71 state , the decrease is smaller .",
    "the dot intracule has been calculated for the first excited state @xmath56 @xcite and shows a small dip in @xmath31 around @xmath30 , which we have previously attributed to the fermi hole .",
    "we now believe that that explanation was incorrect and that the dip is a failure of @xmath31 to capture the behaviour of @xmath0 .",
    "hf posmom intracules of the @xmath72-dimensional he atom : @xmath73 (  ) , @xmath74 ( - - - ) , @xmath75 ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath76 ( - @xmath59 -).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    following the pioneering work of loeser and herschbach on the effect of dimensionality on the hf @xcite and exact energies @xcite of he - like ions , several other two - electron systems have recently been studied in @xmath72 dimensions @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the posmom intracule for a @xmath72-dimensional space is straightforward .",

    "our energies for @xmath82 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 agree within a microhartree with the benchmark values of herschbach and co - workers @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : dhexx ] shows how @xmath0 changes with @xmath72 .",
    "the observation that the intracule broadens as @xmath72 increases is consistent with the conclusion of herrick and stillinger @xcite that the electrons in @xmath72-helium can avoid each other more easily when @xmath72 is large .",
    "furthermore , they have shown that the binding energy of the ground state in @xmath76 corresponds exactly to the binding energy of the @xmath83 state in @xmath74 .",
    "this feature is due to interdimensional degeneracies , first noticed by van vleck @xcite , and observed for various systems @xcite .",
    "we observe likewise that @xmath0 for the @xmath65 state in @xmath84 is identical to @xmath0 for the @xmath83 state in @xmath85 .",
    "we have introduced a new two - particle density distribution , the posmom intracule , which condenses information about both the relative position and relative momentum of the particles .",
    "we have shown how to construct this distribution from the many - particle wave function and we have shown that the dot intracule @xmath31 in a first - order approximation of the posmom intracule @xmath0 . we have applied our new formalism to two - electron quantum dots and the the he - like ions . a comparison between various intracules ( position , momentum , angle ,",
    "dot and posmom ) has been carried out , showing the interrelated information conveyed by these two - particle probability distributions .",
