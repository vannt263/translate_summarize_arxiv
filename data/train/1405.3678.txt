    "residual symmetries in the mass matrices are a means to determine rows and columns in the mixing matrix @xmath1 as pure numbers , independent of the values of the masses , by assuming finiteness of the underlying flavour symmetry group @xmath2for recent reviews on group theory see for instance  @xcite .",
    "this model - independent approach contrasts , for instance , with the idea of texture zeros , where mass ratios are related to mixing angles and cp phases . in recent years , assuming neutrinos are majorana particles , much effort has gone into the discussion of the lepton mixing matrices @xmath1 from residual symmetries . though a lot of results have been achieved  @xcite , the present status has not been reached in a systematic way .",
    "guts  @xcite . ]",
    "thus it is by no means clear if the cases existing in the literature encompass all relevant mixing matrices . in the present paper we close this gap by accomplishing a complete classification of all possible @xmath1 completely determined by residual symmetries .",
    "it turns out that indeed all relevant mixing matrices can already be found in the literature .",
    "before we delve into the advertised classification , we shortly review the idea of residual symmetries , which also allows us to introduce our notation . the mass lagrangian  obtained through flavour symmetry breaking  has the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the charge - conjugation matrix , @xmath5 and @xmath6 contain the three left and right - handed charged - lepton fields , respectively , and @xmath7 consists of the three left - handed neutrino fields .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix @xmath8 is symmetric , due to the assumed majorana nature of the neutrinos , but complex in general .",
    "residual symmetries in the mass matrices are defined via @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are unitary matrices . in the standard model , the fields @xmath7 and @xmath5 are together in a weak doublet , and we assume that this is also true for any extension of it .",
    "therefore , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are given in the same weak basis .",
    "the idea of residual symmetries is that any matrix @xmath10 and any matrix @xmath11 of equation  ( [ residual ] ) contributes to the complete flavour symmetry group @xmath2 of some unknown extension of the standard model .",
    "the group @xmath2 is broken in the charged - lepton sector to the group @xmath12 with @xmath13 and in the neutrino sector to @xmath14 with @xmath15 . because of the specific form of the mass term in the case of majorana neutrinos , @xmath14 must be a subgroup of @xmath16  @xcite , or @xmath17 the klein four - group , if we confine ourselves to matrices @xmath11 with @xmath18 .",
    "in this paper we want to discuss all possibilities such that the residual symmetry groups @xmath12 and @xmath14 fully determine the lepton mixing matrix @xmath1 .",
    "thus we identify @xmath14 with the klein four - group : @xmath19 with three commuting matrices @xmath20 with the properties @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23",
    ". as we will see in the following , in most cases @xmath12 is generated by a single matrix @xmath10 . in some cases , however , one needs two matrices @xmath24 , @xmath25 in order to fully determine @xmath1 ; in such instances , one of these matrices alone fixes only a row in @xmath1 .    how can the residual symmetries determine the mixing matrix @xmath1 ?",
    "let us denote the diagonalising matrices of @xmath26 and @xmath8 by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "then @xmath29 and the lepton mixing matrix is given by @xmath30 since @xmath31 one can show that @xmath28 not only diagonalises @xmath8 , but also the matrices @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the requirement that @xmath32 is diagonal for @xmath33 already determines @xmath28 and no knowledge of @xmath8 is necessary in this framework .",
    "the same argument applies to @xmath26 and @xmath10 .",
    "the diagonalisation of @xmath10 determines @xmath27 , if @xmath10 has non - degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "the only other non - trivial case , differing from the previous one , is that of two commuting @xmath24 , @xmath25 , which after diagonalisation have the form @xmath34 or permutations thereof . in a nutshell , in the framework of residual symmetries , @xmath28 and @xmath27 are determined by @xmath14 and @xmath12 , respectively , whence one gets a handle on the lepton mixing matrix @xmath1 .",
    "is only partially determined by the residual symmetries , then either a column or a row is fixed  @xcite . ]    however , the framework set forth above is still too general to be treatable .",
    "an important extra ingredient is that the group @xmath2 generated by @xmath14 and @xmath12 is _",
    "finite_. this is an _",
    "ad hoc _ assumption , but it has the important consequence that the eigenvalues of all @xmath13 , the eigenvalues of all products of the generators of @xmath2 , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath35 , and the eigenvalues of all multiple products of the generators are roots of unity .",
    "are @xmath36 , thus they are trivially roots of unity . ] by taking traces of these matrices we obtain sums of roots of unity , and therefore known mathematical results concerning these type of sums are applicable  for a previous application see  @xcite , which form the basis for our classification of all cases of @xmath1 . note that in order for the group @xmath2 to be finite it is necessary but in general not sufficient that the eigenvalues of its generators are roots of unity .",
    "nevertheless , in the cases discussed in this paper , it turns out that , if the group generators and some of their products have finite order , then @xmath2 is finite .    in summary , the classification of possible mixing matrices @xmath1",
    "is based on the following premises :    1 .",
    "the standard model with three families of leptons is the low - energy model of some theory of lepton flavour .",
    "neutrinos have majorana nature .",
    "the residual group @xmath14 is the klein four - group , _",
    "i.e. _   @xmath37 .",
    "the group @xmath2 , generated by the elements of @xmath12 and @xmath14 , is finite .",
    "the mixing matrix @xmath1 is completely determined by the residual symmetries .    in the following",
    ", we will always work in a basis where the @xmath20 are diagonal : @xmath38 in this convenient basis , @xmath28 is an unknown diagonal matrix of phase factors .",
    "therefore , in the framework of residual symmetries , the majorana phases in @xmath1 are indeterminate and the lepton mixing matrix @xmath1 is simply given by @xmath39 up to rephasings . moreover , since in our framework the order of the charged - lepton and neutrino masses is undefined , it is only possible to determine @xmath1 up to independent row and column permutations .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ tools ]",
    "we discuss some mathematical results .",
    "these are used later , in section  [ basic forms ] , to determine the possible forms of @xmath40 which is defined as the matrix of absolute values of @xmath10 : @xmath41 it turns out that there are only five such basic forms ( later on reduced to three by additional considerations ) , modulo independent permutations of rows and columns .",
    "then , in section  [ equivalent ] , we perform a general discussion of equivalent forms of @xmath10 , which are those forms which lead to trivial variations of the mixing matrix @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we investigate the freedom of permutations and argue that , without loss of generality , we can confine ourselves to matrices @xmath10 which can be written as @xmath42 in this formula , @xmath43 contains the `` internal '' or ckm - type phase of a unitary matrix and @xmath44 is a diagonal matrix of phase factors .",
    "we identify in section  [ permutations ] the genuinely different forms of @xmath40 which emerge from the five basic forms by permutations .",
    "it remains to investigate the phases of @xmath10 .",
    "we first determine in section  [ internal ] the `` internal '' phase of @xmath10 for each form of @xmath40 . in section",
    "[ not finite ] we demonstrate that forms  1 and  4 do not lead to finite groups .",
    "the extensive section  [ external ] is devoted to the computation of @xmath44 or `` external '' phases in @xmath10 for the basics forms  2 , 3 and  5 . at this point",
    "we have completely determined @xmath10 up to equivalent forms , so in this section we also provide our main result , the possible cases of @xmath1 . in section  [ combining ] we discuss the remaining solutions where @xmath12 has two generators , each with a twofold degenerate eigenvalue ",
    "see equation  ( [ t1t2 ] ) .",
    "we conclude with section  [ concl ] .",

    "it is expedient to reflect on the ambiguities in the determination of @xmath1 with the method used here .",
    "the first observation is that the choice of basis for the @xmath20 in equation  ( [ sss ] ) leaves still some freedom for basis transformations .",
    "the reason is that @xmath129 where @xmath130 is a @xmath131 permutation matrix and @xmath132 is a diagonal matrix of phase factors , may transform one @xmath20 into another , but the set of matrices of equation  ( [ sss ] ) is invariant under this similarity transformation . on the other hand , the transformation  ( [ v ] ) acts also on @xmath10 as @xmath133 and we can use this freedom to fix some conventions for @xmath10 .",
    "this is an important issue because it prevents us from over - counting the number of cases and from studying equivalent cases twice .",

    "for each of the five basic forms of equation  ( [ basic ] ) , we take the matrix displayed there as the starting point and indicate it by the subscript @xmath136 .",
    "2 .   due to equation  ( [ tv ] )",
    "we are allowed to confine ourselves to permutations from the right in order to find inequivalent matrices @xmath137 with @xmath138 3 .",
    "in general there will be less than six inequivalent matrices @xmath40 for each of the basics forms , as some matrices which emerge from each other by a permutation from the right might still be equivalent due to the equality of some matrix elements or , in the case of form  5 , because it is possible to make the exchange @xmath139 .",
    "4 .   after having found , for each basic form , the inequivalent matrices @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is a permutation matrix , we determine the internal phase associated with each @xmath137 . denoting the resulting matrix by @xmath142 , we can choose phase conventions such that @xmath143 for all @xmath144 .",
    "the matrix @xmath10 will also have external phases . applying again equation  ( [ tv ] )",
    ", we can assume that these phases are taken care of by multiplying @xmath43 by a diagonal matrix of phase factors @xmath44 from the right .",
    "in essence , the @xmath44 will be determined by the requirement that @xmath10 has finite order .",
    "note , however , that , given a basic form and one of its possible @xmath142 , there can be several solutions of @xmath44",
    ". 6 .   finally ,",
    "since the matrices @xmath20 are real , for every solution @xmath10 there is the complex conjugate solution @xmath145 .",
    "eventually we are not interested in the possible @xmath10 but in the possible mixing matrices @xmath1 . according to equation  ( [ u1 ] )",
    "the two matrices are linked via @xmath146 the order of the eigenvalues is indeterminate and @xmath147 is invariant under phase transformations .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 can undergo rephasing and permutations from the left .",
    "equation  ( [ tv ] ) implies that the same holds from the right , with rephasings and permutations independent from those on the left .",
    "to this indeterminacy one has to add the possibility of complex conjugation of @xmath1 . given these trivial phase variations of the mixing matrix and the need to factor them out , we will be focusing on @xmath148 .",
    "the group @xmath2 , determined by the three @xmath20 and by one or two matrices @xmath10 which generate @xmath12 , is not changed by the above manipulations of @xmath10 . actually , what we have at hand is not directly the group @xmath2 but its representation on the three leptonic gauge doublets . in this sense , the change @xmath149 for the @xmath13 corresponds to switching from one representation to its complex conjugate . we can also remove an overall phase factor @xmath150 from a @xmath10 , if @xmath150 is root of unity",
    "this will , in general , change the group , but the group will remain finite .",
    "in order to investigate the inequivalent permutations of the columns of @xmath151 , it is appropriate to use the representation of the permutations @xmath152 as permutation matrices : @xmath153 it is easy to check that the representation property @xmath154 is fulfilled for any two @xmath155 .",

    "concerning form  3 , equation  ( [ basic3 ] ) , we find that it is invariant under cyclic permutations .",

    "since in form  5 , equation  ( [ basic5 ] ) , the angle @xmath57 is free apart from being rational , the exchange @xmath139 relates equivalent forms .",
    "so in effect we are lead back to the argumentation applied to form  2 .",
    "for definiteness , we choose @xmath176 $ ] .    in summary ,",
    "the inequivalent forms obtained by the above discussion are given by    [ basic5-permutations ] @xmath177",
    "in order to compute the internal phase of @xmath10 , we can use the formulas provided in  @xcite : @xmath178 it is well known that the existence of an internal phase of a unitary matrix is independent of the phase convention  @xcite .",
    "this can also be seen from the above equations for @xmath179 and @xmath180 . however , where to place the internal phase in @xmath10 is , of course , convention - dependent .",
    "it suffices to find the internal phase for subform  a in equation  ( [ basic5-permutations ] ) for each of the five basic forms , since the other subforms emerge from  a by permutation of the columns .    for each form",

    "since these procedures are standard methods in linear algebra , we only display the results :    @xmath182    of the phase factors occurring in these formulas , @xmath183 is defined in equation  ( [ obg ] ) and @xmath184 as discussed in section  [ equivalent ] , @xmath43 only needs to be computed modulo complex conjugation .",
    "we begin with @xmath185 theorem  [ troots ] requires that the phase factors of @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 are roots of unity .",
    "therefore , these phases are @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively , with roots of unity @xmath192 ( @xmath193 ) . from these equations",
    "we derive @xmath194 , etc .",
    "hence it follows that @xmath195 with roots of unity @xmath196 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath197 since @xmath10 has finite order , @xmath198 has to be a root of unity .",
    "but one can easily check that @xmath198 fulfills @xmath199 therefore , according to theorem  [ roots1 ] , @xmath198 is not a root of unity and @xmath10 of equation  ( [ 1a ] ) does not belong to a finite group .",
    "next we consider @xmath200 applying again theorem  [ troots ] , we find that the phase factors of @xmath186 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 are roots of unity . from this",

    "thus there are more than five non - zero elements in @xmath574 , which excludes the basic form  5 .",
    "thus only the basic forms  2 and  3 with all possible permutations come into question , with the boundary condition @xmath578 .",
    "first of all , this gives @xmath579 secondly , there are eight possible forms of @xmath574 which are @xmath580 considering these matrices , we see that always one of the following two equalities holds : @xmath581 exploiting these equations , we obtain @xmath582 defining @xmath583 , the external phases are given by @xmath584 however , the first relation leads to @xmath585 or @xmath586 , which can not occur in the basic forms  2 and  3 .",
    "this leaves us with @xmath587 finally , we are in a position to determine @xmath198 for all cases of @xmath136 : @xmath588 the phase factors @xmath268 and @xmath269 are defined in equation  ( [ phi - rho0 ] ) . of course , for every @xmath198 also @xmath589 is a solution of equation  ( [ ax ] ) , but in the light of the discussion in section  [ equivalent ] this is a trivial variation .",

    "another observation is that phase factors can not be `` aligned , '' _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath592 ( @xmath593 ) , because otherwise one or more entries at the diagonal of @xmath566 would be @xmath594 which is forbidden for all basic forms except form  5 which we have excluded before .",

    "if @xmath566 is if form  2 which has one zero , this zero can only be on the diagonal . however , @xmath634 rules out this possibility .",
    "so it remains to consider @xmath566 being of form  3 and of form  5 .",
    "if @xmath566 is of form  3 , then the elements on the diagonal are either all the same or all different .",
    "since the first option leads to a non - symmetric matrix , we are left with the second option , namely having @xmath75 , @xmath635 and @xmath636 on the diagonal .",

    "but then , with a further basis change , one can remove the phases from @xmath701 and @xmath702 : @xmath703 and @xmath704    in this final basis , our group @xmath2 has the generators @xmath353 , @xmath700 , @xmath698 and @xmath568 .",
    "clearly , @xmath698 and @xmath568 are generators of permutations , so @xmath2 has the structure  @xcite @xmath705 , where @xmath706 is the normal subgroup consisting of all diagonal matrices and @xmath163 consists of all @xmath131 permutations matrices .",
    "this @xmath706 is generated by @xmath353 , @xmath700 , and matrices where the elements on the diagonal of @xmath353 and @xmath700 are permuted .",
    "we can write @xmath249 as @xmath707 with integers @xmath453 and @xmath69 , and @xmath453 coprime to @xmath69 . if @xmath69 is",
    "even , we define @xmath708 if @xmath69 is odd , we consider @xmath709 instead for the definition of @xmath710 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath711 thus it is useful to define @xmath712 and @xmath713 , where @xmath714 for @xmath69 even and @xmath715 for @xmath69 odd .",
    "note that @xmath713 is coprime to @xmath716 . since @xmath717",
    "we can dispense with the generator @xmath353 .    according to theorem  1 in  @xcite ,",
    "there is a procedure to find two generators which reveal the structure of @xmath706 and , as a consequence , the structure of @xmath2 .",
    "we first need to find the element with the highest order in @xmath706 .",
    "since @xmath713 is coprime to @xmath716 , there must be a positive integer @xmath631 such that @xmath718 this matrix has the highest possible order in @xmath706 .",
    "in the next step we have to find the generator of the subgroup of @xmath706 which has  1 as the first entry .",
    "it is easy to see that in our case every element in this subgroup is a power of @xmath719 if @xmath720 , there is a positive integer @xmath632 such that @xmath721 and we obviously arrive at the conclusion that the flavour group is @xmath722 .    for the remaining cases we use again the results of",
    "if @xmath723 divides @xmath69 , the flavour group is given by @xmath724 .",
    "finally , we have to consider @xmath725 but @xmath456 . in this case we put @xmath726 with @xmath727 .",
    "note that @xmath728 or @xmath729 .",
    "now we proceed as before , but with the replacements @xmath730 in equation  ( [ te ] ) and , due to equation  ( [ ee ] ) , @xmath731 next we have a closer look at @xmath732 given that @xmath69 is divisible by @xmath733 but not by @xmath723 , we find that @xmath734 is divisible by @xmath733 .",
    "so we end up with @xmath735/3}{n/3 } \\right).\\ ] ] this should be compared to @xmath707 defined before equation  ( [ f1 ] ) . in effect , we replace @xmath69 by @xmath736 and we proceed as before , starting from equation  ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "eventually , we arrive at the group @xmath737 , with @xmath716 being defined above .",
    "we are dealing here with @xmath738 where @xmath57 is a rational angle , _",
    "i.e. _   @xmath350 is a root of unity .",
    "this case clearly involves only two - family mixing and we present it here only for completeness . because it is physically irrelevant",
    ", we do not discuss all the details .",
    "the phase factor @xmath250 and the product @xmath739 must be roots of unity . the only non - trivial part of @xmath10 is the 23-sector , so we focus exclusively on this sector .",
    "there we have the two generators @xmath740 where @xmath46 is the 23-block of the generator @xmath741 of equation  ( [ sss ] ) .",
    "we search for possible values of the pair @xmath742 which lead to a finite group .",
    "let us denote the eigenvalues of @xmath743 by @xmath744 , @xmath745 and those of @xmath746 by @xmath747 , @xmath748 .",
    "then we find @xmath749 or @xmath750 taking the square of the absolute values of these relations , we obtain consistency only if @xmath751 is purely imaginary .",
    "finally , we can express @xmath752 and @xmath753 as @xmath754    we can use equation  ( [ cos ] ) to constrain the possible values @xmath755 and @xmath756 . using @xmath757 ,",
    "we get the following vanishing sum of roots of unity : @xmath758 this sum is exactly of the form of equation  ( [ lambda2 ] ) of section  [ basic forms ] , with its solutions given in equation  ( [ abc ] ) .",
    "these solutions imply @xmath759 up to conjugations and permutations , where @xmath524 is some arbitrary root of unity . with this",
    "we obtain the seven cases @xmath760 or the reversed order .",
    "note that @xmath761 preserves @xmath762see equation  ( [ cos])and @xmath763 is transformed to @xmath764see equation  ( [ kappa23 ] ) . while the conjugation of this phase is irrelevant , in general this is not true for the sign reversal .",
    "so , for each of the seven cases in equation  ( [ st ] ) , one has to take into account the two signs of @xmath763 .      in the following",
