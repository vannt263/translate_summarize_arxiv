    "these studies relied primarily upon spatially integrated line profiles to understand the dynamics of the nlr @xcite , but the problem arose that the emission - line profiles of the nlr can be explained by many different types of dynamical models , such as infall , rotation and outflows @xcite .    with the launch of _ hst_and its high angular resolution ( @xmath0 0@xmath21 ) , the nlrs of seyfert galaxies have received considerable attention . with the limited long - slit capability of the faint object camera ( foc ) , and later the expanded capability of stis , detailed constraints on the kinematics of the nlrs in seyfert and",
    "other galaxies became possible . in turn , these kinematic studies provided good diagnostics upon which dynamical analyses can be based .",
    "the structure of the nlr resembles a bicone as expected from a simple unified model of seyfert galaxies , due to collimation by a thick torus @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite have modeled the nlr of ngc  4151 and found it to be consistent with a biconical geometry . in an _",
    "hst_study done on a sample of seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies , @xcite compared both seyfert types to study their nlr morphologies , and found triangular structures in most of their seyfert 2s , and circular structures in most of their seyfert 1s , consistent with the unified model and biconical structure for the nlr ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite modeled the inner regions of the seyfert galaxy ngc 2992 , and found that the ionized gas can be fitted with a biconical structure .",
    "we have recently completed a study of the kinematics of the nlrs in two seyfert galaxies ( @xcite 2005 , hereafter paper i , and @xcite 2006 , hereafter paper ii ) . since",
    "our dynamical work in this paper is a direct extension of the works of those two papers , we summarize our results below . in paper",
    "i , kinematic models were developed to match the emission - line velocities from high - resolution stis spectra within @xmath0 400 pc of the central black hole of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  4151 .",
    "the nlr gas showed strong evidence of acceleration from @xmath0 0 pc out to @xmath0 100 pc , then showed deceleration back to systemic velocity at @xmath0 400 pc with velocity roughly proportional to distance in each case .",
    "the maximum velocity of the outflowing gas at the turnover point ( 96 pc ) was @xmath0 800  km s@xmath3relative to the black hole .",
    "based on our kinematic model , the nlr could be represented by a bicone , with inner and outer half opening angles of 15 and 33  respectively , and inclination of @xmath0 45  with respect to the plane of the sky , consistent with previous kinematic work done on ngc  4151 with different slit positions @xcite .",
    "some of the fainter nlr clouds showed evidence of backflow at the point where the clouds turnover in their velocities .",
    "the radio jet was found to have little effect on the kinematics of the nlr clouds , however there was some evidence of radial velocity splitting of the fainter nlr clouds near bright knots in the radio jet .",
    "the brighter clouds were not accelerated by the jet .    in paper ii , we developed a similar model for the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc  1068 again with high - resolution spectra taken with the stis aboard _",
    "hst_. with seven parallel slit positions covering the entire nlr , we extracted radial velocity profiles and matched them with our newly developed 3-d biconical models .",
    "our kinematical models showed that the nlr gas accelerated out to @xmath0 140 pc ( the turnover point ) , then decelerated back to systemic velocity at a distance of @xmath0 400 pc from the central black hole .",
    "the maximum velocity of outflow of the gas was @xmath0 2000  km s@xmath3 , with respect to the black hole , and the model predicted and inner and outer half opening angles of the bicone of 20 and 40  respectively , and an inclination of 5  out of the plane of the sky .",
    "we used high resolution radio maps of the nlr obtained from @xcite to search for jet / cloud interactions .",
    "evidence showed that , similar to ngc  4151 , the fainter nlr clouds were split near bright knots in the radio jets , whereas the brighter nlr clouds remained unaffected by the jet .",
    "other seyfert galaxies show similar flow patterns to ngc  4151 and ngc  1068 , such as the seyfert 2 galaxy mrk 3 @xcite .",
    "the radial velocities of these galaxies were matched with a common kinematic model with little variation in the parameter space , which begs the question , what are the physical processes involve that would cause such a similar flow pattern in both types of seyfert galaxies ?",
    "it is this question that motivated us to carry out this dynamical study .      in the first truly dynamical model of the nlr based on _",
    "hst_kinematics , @xcite attempted to fit the nlr velocities in ngc  4151 , based on measurements done by @xcite .",
    "they tested an isothermal parker wind model which assumes thermally expanding winds @xcite . by assuming a spherical cloud geometry",
    ", they let the parker wind drag along the embedded nlr clouds .",
    "as the parker wind accelerates by thermal expansion and slowly loses heat by adiabatic cooling , the clouds are also accelerated to high speeds .",
    "they then let the parker wind run into a low density ambient medium to slow the velocity of the wind , and hence the clouds , to the systemic velocity .",
    "the model explains the velocity profile of the nlr of ngc  4151 , but suffers from the fact that an isothermal wind can not be sustained out to large distances .",
    "also , the mass profile of the smbh plus galaxy , which determines the temperature profile for their model , is not exactly known for ngc  4151 .",
    "hence while their model was not successful on physical grounds , it is worth noting its relative success in matching the nlr kinematics .    in this paper ,",
    "the main question we want address is : how can we constrain the dynamics of the nlr in seyfert galaxies with the detailed knowledge that we have gained from our kinematic studies ? here , we concentrate on the dynamics of the nlr in ngc  1068 , since it has the best constraints",
    ". we will start with a simple construction of the enclosed mass function based on data from previous studies and eventually formulate a radiation pressure - gravity tug - of - war on the nlr clouds .",
    "the questions we will attempt to answer include the following : 1 ) if the nlr gas is in outflow , is radiation pressure really the best driving mechanism ?",
    "2 ) if the nlr gas is turning over its velocity and decelerating back to systemic , is gravity responsible for stopping the gas ?",
    "3 ) can we fit the velocity profile of the data with a simple radiation - gravity law , or do we need to include another force ( such as drag ) ?    our analysis applies to ngc  1068 in particular , but has relevance to all seyferts in general that show signs of gas outflow and subsequent deceleration @xcite . to test whether gravity is playing any role in stopping and turning back the gas velocity , we will construct a mass profile within @xmath4 10,000 pc from the nucleus of ngc  1068 . with the mass profile in hand , we will test whether the gas kinematics are dominated by rotation .",
    "such a test might prove fruitful for rotation in ngc  4151 , which shows redshifts northeast and blueshifts southwest of the nucleus , but from a geometrical point of view , rotation of the gas will prove difficult to match the velocity field of ngc  1068 , which shows blueshifts and redshifts on each side of the nucleus .",
    "next we plot the escape velocity with distance to see if the gas should escape or not , given the velocities seen in the data , and whether or not the kinematics of the nlr can be dominated by gravitational infall .",
    "then we concentrate on outflow assuming spherical symmetry and pure radial motion .",
    "first we determine if the deceleration of the gas can be attributed to the enclosed mass , regardless of the outward accelerating force .",
    "we then apply radiative line driving plus gravitational forces and compare the results to the observed velocity law of ngc  1068 derived from the kinematic models .",
    "finally , we introduce a drag force due to an ambient medium on the nlr clouds , in addition to radiation pressure and gravity , to determine if it can improve the fit to either the accelerating or decelerating portions of the observed velocity curve .",
    "in building a model of the enclosed mass as a function of distance from the central smbh , we incorporate various subsystems into our mass profile . these include contributions from the smbh , the nuclear stellar cluster , and the bulge . for all these systems ,",
    "we assume spherical symmetry for simplicity .",
    "we have assumed that the stellar cluster and bulge extend all the way inward to the smbh , which may overestimate the mass close in .",
    "the size of the stellar cluster was estimated to be @xmath0 140 pc based on a study by @xcite and the bulge was assumed to extend up to 10000 pc .",
    "mass contribution from the galactic disk of ngc  1068 was neglected because the galactic potential is dominated by the large bulge to at least 1000 pc , which is well beyond the extent of the nlr .",
    "ngc  1068 is one of only a few agn that shows an edge - on disk of h@xmath50maser emission close to the smbh .",
    "the disk shows the signature of a rotational velocity curve , which can be used to determine the mass of the smbh .",
    "@xcite estimated the mass of ngc  1068 to be 1.5@xmath610@xmath7within 0.65 pc , based on the velocity field of the h@xmath50maser emission observed with the vlba and the vla .",
    "we will therefore use this estimate for the mass of the smbh .",
    "since we are going out to @xmath4 10,000 pc , which encloses the nlr and the enlr clouds , we need an accurate assessment of the total mass within this region . at small distances ( @xmath8 1 pc ) , the smbh is dominant , although in the case of ngc  1068 , a concentrated stellar cluster is also providing substantial gravity close in . for an estimate of the bulge mass in ngc  1068 , we rely on the work of @xcite .",
    "they found a tight correlation between black - hole mass and bulge mass for a sample of 30 galaxies , including ngc  1068 .",
    "they determined the bulge mass by modeling the bulge with the jeans equation in spherical form .",
    "they assumed the bulge to be isotropic and spherically symmetric , which might lead to an overestimation of the bulge mass ; however they also neglect any contribution from dark matter , which would tend to underestimate the bulge mass .",
    "their value for the bulge mass in ngc  1068 is 2.3@xmath610@xmath9within a radius @xmath10 = 3r@xmath11 ( 3 effective radii ) , where r@xmath11 = 3.1 @xmath12 0.8 kpc , a value taken from the surface brightness deconvolution of @xcite .",
    "the effective radius r@xmath11 is defined to be such that half of the total light from the galaxy is predicted to be contained within the isophotal ellipse that has area @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "elliptical galaxies and bulges surface brightnesses can be well described by the empirical formula developed by @xcite @xmath14},\\ ] ] where @xmath15 = i(@xmath16 ) . in the 1980s1990s",
    ", a family of stellar density curves emerged that modeled both elliptical galaxies and bulges well .",
    "these curves are of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( in pc ) is a scaling radius and m is the total mass of the bulge @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 determines different types of models , where the @xmath19 = 2 cases corresponds to previous density models by @xcite and the @xmath19 = 1 cases to models by @xcite .",
    "these models , when integrated over a spherical volume , yield the following enclosed mass profile : @xmath20 for the special case when @xmath19 = 1.5 , the density profile of equation  [ dp ] yields a surface density distribution that closely matches the de vaucouleurs surface brightness profile of equation  [ sbp ] to within 15% over nearly 4 decades in radius @xcite .",
    "therefore we adopt the following form of the mass function as the bulge profile @xmath21 we find a suitable value for @xmath18 in equation  [ mf ] by first defining the ` half - mass radius ' @xmath22 : @xmath23 which yields the following relation for @xmath18 @xmath24 @xcite has found a simple approximation for @xmath25 that depends only slightly on @xmath19 . for a @xmath26 , he found that @xmath27 therefore we can find a value for @xmath18 by using @xmath19 = 1.5 , @xmath16 given above , and equation  [ cona ] .",
    "we find that @xmath28 pc .",
    "we also know that m(3r@xmath11 ) = 2.3@xmath610@xmath9 , so that @xmath29^{1.5}\\\\    & = 3.2\\times10^{10}{\\mbox{\\ m\\ensuremath{_{\\odot}}}\\xspace}.\\tag{8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the bulge mass distribution can finally be written as @xmath30      it is known that ngc  1068 has a compact nuclear stellar cluster @xmath31 140 pc in radius @xcite , which contributes significant mass to the total mass profile of the nlr of ngc  1068 . therefore this mass must be taken into account when deriving the mass profile .",
    "@xcite found a mass of 6.8@xmath610@xmath32within 1  of the smbh of ngc  1068 , assuming a virialized , isotropic , and isothermal distribution of the stars .",
    "they used the stellar velocity distribution ( @xmath33 ) found in @xcite , a value of 143 @xmath12 5  km s@xmath3at @xmath4 1 , to calculate the total dynamical mass within 1  of the nucleus of ngc  1068 .",
    "@xmath34 where @xmath35 pc for ngc  1068 .",
    "this mass includes contributions from the stellar cluster , the nucleus , and the bulge within a radius of 72 pc . therefore to find just the mass from the stellar cluster @xmath36 , we took out the rest of the mass contribution from the total mass .",
    "@xmath37 making the various substitutions we have @xmath38    based on the radial surface brightness profile presented in figure  4 of @xcite , @xcite computed a power law consistent with the form @xmath39 to fit the data .",
    "they claim that if the profile traces the stellar mass distribution , then they would expect that the mass profile would have the form m@xmath40 , given a spherical , isothermal distribution of stars in the cluster . using their distribution",
    "we can estimate the stellar mass function based on the condition @xmath41= @xmath42 , so that @xmath43pc@xmath3 .",
    "the stellar cluster mass function is therefore @xmath44 beyond the observed extent of the stellar cluster , we assumed that @xmath45 is a constant .",
    "finally the total enclosed mass function for the nlr of ngc  1068 is given by @xmath46 or @xmath47",
    "a figure representing the total mass enclosed within @xmath48 is shown in the top panel of figure  [ mass_rot_esc_vel_pro ] .",
    "the mass profiles for each contribution , the smbh , bulge , and cluster are also shown in the figure .",
    "close in toward the nucleus , the nuclear stellar cluster dominates up to its entire extent , while the bulge takes over from there .",
    "the black hole mass dominates at @xmath8 2 pc .",
    "the kink in the total mass curve at @xmath4 140 pc is because the stellar cluster was cut off abruptly at this location .",
    "we could have modeled the cluster to assume an exponential drop - off after 140 pc , but this would not have contributed much to the gravitational force exerted by the total mass .      with the total mass profile",
    "we calculate the circular rotational velocity and plot it as a function of distance as shown in the middle panel of figure  [ mass_rot_esc_vel_pro ] .",
    "the rotation velocity only depends on the enclosed mass at radius @xmath48 , and is given by the formula below @xmath49 for demonstration purposes , we show the rotational velocities as if only each mass component was present , as well as the velocity for the total mass profile .",
    "the rotational velocity profile indicates to us that rotation can not dominate the kinematics of the nlr of ngc  1068 because many observed data points exhibit large velocities ( @xmath1 1000  km s@xmath3 ) , whereas the rotation curve never exceeds @xmath0 220  km s@xmath3at large distances ( 100 pc ) .",
    "again the stellar cluster dominates the velocities up to @xmath4 300 pc .",
    "the escape velocity at a given distance @xmath48 is calculated numerically from the formula @xmath50 based on the enclosed mass function , and is plotted in the bottom panel of figure  [ mass_rot_esc_vel_pro ] . according to our kinematic model , the maximum velocity at the turnover radius @xmath51 = 140 pc is 2000  km s@xmath3(paper ii ) ; therefore figure  [ mass_rot_esc_vel_pro ] tells us that the nlr clouds should have escaped after 140 pc , where the escape velocity is only @xmath4 500  km s@xmath3 . in the data however , clouds at 140 pc are at much higher velocity than escape velocity ; yet after the turnover point , the clouds start to decrease their velocity and return to systemic .",
    "thus , some force other than gravity is causing the clouds to decelerate at r @xmath1 140 pc .",
    "the infall velocity profile is equivalent to the escape velocity profile , except that the velocity vector is now directed inward .",
    "therefore gravitational infall also can not account for the faster moving clouds at 140 pc , and in general does not match the observed velocity profile ( paper ii ) .      to test the importance of the force of gravity alone on slowing down the outflowing nlr clouds , we give the clouds a maximum velocity at the turnover point and let gravity do the rest .",
    "in other words , we assume that there is no outward driving force after the turnover point and let the clouds coast under the force of gravity .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ coasting_velocity_profiles ]    ( top ) and 400  km s@xmath3(bottom ) shown in solid lines for the clouds in ngc  1068 .",
    "the other mass components effect are shown in different linestyles represented by the key above the curves .",
    "the clouds barely slow down out to 10,000 pc when launch with 1000  km s@xmath3 .",
    "however , gravity was able to slow down the clouds down when they were launched with 300  km s@xmath3.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    shows that with a maximum velocity @xmath1 1000  km s@xmath3at 140 pc , there is little deceleration with radius .",
    "however , with maximum velocities @xmath8 300  km s@xmath3gravity can slow the clouds down to rest , as seen in the bottom panel of figure  [ coasting_velocity_profiles ] .",
    "the maximum velocities in the nlrs of some seyfert galaxies are on the order of @xmath4 400  km s@xmath3@xcite , and gravitational deceleration may be important in these cases .",
    "the kinematic model of ngc  1068 , however , shows maximum velocities of up to @xmath4 2000  km s@xmath3 , clearly out of the reach of gravitational deceleration .",
    "gravity alone can not slow down the outflowing clouds in this case and there must be some other force or forces involved .    to compound the problem ,",
    "suppose we let radiation or some other force push on the gas while gravity is trying to pull it back",
    ". in this case the gravitational deceleration will be even less .",
    "however , to further explore this issue , we generate a line - driven radiation model , with gravity competing to slow the gas down .",
    "this will eventually lead us in the direction of including a drag force to complete the analysis .",
    "the various mechanisms to push the gas out from close to the nucleus include a radiation pressure driven wind , a thermally driven wind , or a magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) wind @xcite .",
    "the latter two methods are discussed in more detail in @xcite and @xcite , and were summarized in  [ flow ] .",
    "however , no dynamical model to date has led to a satisfactory description of the kinematics in ngc  1068 or ngc  4151 .",
    "the radiation driven wind mechanism is most efficient when the momentum imparted to the gas is due to line - driving ( bound - bound transitions ) , although bound - free and free - free electron transitions ( thomson scattering ) also contribute to driving the gas out @xcite .",
    "the radiation force is dependent on the ionization state of the gas , with lower ionization states more efficient due to the greater availability of electrons in the bound states .",
    "if dust is mixed in with the nlr gas , then it will compete with the gas in absorbing ionizing photons and hence radiation pressure on the dust can become an important contributor to the velocities of the outflowing gas in the nlr @xcite .",
    "if the dust grains are electrically charged , they can drag the ionized gas along to similar velocities as the dust . in this section",
    "we ignore the effects of dust , which would only increase the radiative acceleration .",
    "thus we consider a radiation driving mechanism coupled with the effects of gravity to find the velocity profile of the nlr gas .",
    "we start with the acceleration due to radiation on a point mass , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the acceleration , @xmath54 is the bolometric luminosity of ngc  1068 , @xmath55 is the thomson scattering cross section for the electron , @xmath10 is the distance , @xmath56 is the speed of light , @xmath57 is the mass of the proton , and @xmath58 is the force multiplier . as mentioned above , to really drive the gas out efficiently , we need to incorporate other sources of opacity such as bound - bound and bound - free opacity in addition to those from thomson scattering .",
    "these additional opacities are included via the force multiplier , @xmath58 in equation  [ acc ] , which is primarily a function of ionization parameter is defined as @xmath59 = @xmath60 at the ionized face of the clouds , where @xmath61 = 13.6 ev and @xmath62 is the hydrogen number density . ]",
    "@xmath63 for a given spectral energy distribution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the acceleration due to gravity per mass is simply given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the total enclosed mass within @xmath10 parsecs , and @xmath66 is the universal gravitational constant .",
    "putting equations  [ acc ] and [ acc2 ] together we have @xmath67 now we will have to rewrite the acceleration in terms of velocity as a function of radius , and then solve for @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 therefore we can now write equation  [ acc3 ] as a simple separable differential equation @xmath70 substituting for the constants in equation  [ vel2 ] and converting to appropriate units of  km s@xmath3and pc , then integrating and setting the initial velocity to zero yields the following form for @xmath68 @xmath71dt},\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is luminosity in units of @xmath73 ergs s@xmath3 and @xmath65 is in units of @xmath74 .",
    "the constraints on the luminosity and the force multiplier are presented in the next section .",
    "since ngc  1068 is a seyfert 2 galaxy , we can not measure its luminosity directly . from @xcite , the total luminosity of ngc  1068",
    "is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the fraction of nuclear flux observed as scattered radiation , @xmath77 is the distance to ngc  1068 , and @xmath78 is the solar luminosity .",
    "the most uncertain term in equation  [ lum ] is @xmath76 . @xcite",
    "have summarized a range of values for @xmath76 that have been determined previously by several authors .",
    "the range in @xmath76 spans a few orders of magnitude , from 0.0010.05 .",
    "they claim that the best estimate comes from @xcite , who had determined a value for @xmath76 to be 0.015 , based on observations of [ oiii]and broad @xmath79 luminosity and their ratio .",
    "@xcite concluded that @xmath76 is probably within a factor of a few of 0.01 , hence we have adopted a value for @xmath76 of 0.015 because it is the `` best '' estimate and close to the average value adopted by @xcite .",
    "we already know the distance to ngc  1068 as 14.4 mpc @xcite so the bolometric luminosity of ngc  1068 is given by @xmath80 a value which could be uncertain by a factor of 0.315 , depending on @xmath76 .",
    "the emission lines arising from the nlr gas are best fitted with a two component photoionization model at each position , based on _ hst_/stis long - slit spectra @xcite . according to @xcite",
    ", the ionization state of the gas ranges from @xmath81@xmath82 for the two components but seems to vary little with distance .",
    "using @xmath63 and the sed for ngc  1068 , we found the force multiplier to vary from @xmath83 5006000 for the front face ( ionized face ) of the clouds , based on cloudy models @xcite .",
    "the mass function was derived in previous sections , and @xmath72 = 2.4 , so we can now numerically solve equation  [ finvel ] for @xmath68 , assuming @xmath58 is constant with distance .",
    "the results are presented in the next section .",
    "equation  [ finvel ] has only two parameters that we can vary to find the velocity @xmath84 as a function of distance @xmath10 : the launch radius @xmath85 , and the force multiplier @xmath58 .",

    "the maximum velocity and maximum distance reached for these curves do not fit the data.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    shows that with a launch radius of @xmath85 = 1 pc , the velocity of the gas increases with force multiplier , but quickly reaches a terminal velocity and does not slow down significantly , even out to @xmath4 10,000 pc .",
    "this is not a surprise , as previous plots had shown that the mass is not enough to slow down the high - velocity clouds .",
    "in addition , the maximum velocities for @xmath87 500 are too high compared to the observations , indicating that we must increase the launch radius @xmath85 .",
    "the physical constraints on the nlr gas suggested that the force multiplier is larger than 500 .",
    "however , we generated plots for @xmath58 smaller than 500 to see whether or not gravity can slow the clouds down , if the clouds are launched from 1 pc .",
    "in the middle panel of figure  [ fm_high_low_ro_velocity_profiles ] , we see that with force multipliers @xmath8 40 , gravity does slow the clouds down , but that the maximum velocities are too low to fit the data of ngc  1068 .",
    "such models may prove useful for seyferts with lower outflow velocities in their nlrs , such as ngc  4151 and mkn  3 @xcite .",
    "we next fix the force multiplier to the lowest value of 500 ( because higher values of @xmath58 will be even more problematic to slow down the clouds ) and vary the launch radius .",
    "these plots are presented in the bottom panel of figure  [ fm_high_low_ro_velocity_profiles ] .",
    "the maximum velocity falls below the observed values at @xmath88 2 pc , and the final velocity does not return to zero until we reach large launch radii . as the launch radius increases to @xmath4 32 pc , the maximum attainable velocity of the outflowing clouds decreases , and",
    "the enclosed mass is finally able to turn the velocity around .",
    "however by that time , the maximum velocity is much lower than predicted by the kinematic model .",
    "also , the launch radius and the maximum distance of outflow become too large to fit the data , since the nlr clouds generally launch from close in and drop in radial velocity within 400 pc ( paper ii ) .",
    "clearly these curves can not fit the observed nlr velocities of ngc  1068 .",
    "the radiation - gravity interaction on the nlr clouds of ngc  1068 fails to reproduce its velocity profile . for reasonable parameters ,",
    "the velocity increases quickly close to the nucleus and mostly remains constant over large distances regardless of launch radius .",
    "the maximum outflow velocity is rather sensitive to launch radius and decreases with increasing @xmath85 but the clouds velocities never turn over and decrease .",
    "fine - tuning @xmath85 and @xmath58 outside of the range of reasonable parameters can lead to a deceleration profile , but the resulting velocity profile and amplitude does not match the observed trend . therefore we conclude that there must be additional forces at play in the nlr to account for the velocity profile that we see in the data .",
    "one such force that could explain the trend in the data is drag , whereby the clouds are slowing down in a more diffuse , hotter , and higher ionization medium @xcite .",
    "the drag force exerted on a cloud by an ambient medium is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the mass density of the ambient medium , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the velocities of the cloud and medium respectively , and @xmath93 represents the cross sectional area of a cloud @xcite .",
    "following everett & murray , we assume the clouds to be spherical with mass @xmath94 = @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the radius of a cloud , and @xmath97 is its mass density .",
    "the acceleration on the clouds due to drag is then @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the hydrogen number density and @xmath57 is the mass of the proton . in our case ,",
    "we assume that the velocity of the ambient medium is zero and the radius of the cloud remains constant . therefore with @xmath100 we can write @xmath101 where @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) is the hydrogen column density of the cloud , and the minus sign represents deceleration .",
    "combined with the radiative and gravitational acceleration of equation  [ acc3 ] , the total acceleration on the clouds becomes @xmath104 and in differential form is @xmath105 substituting the various constants and converting to units of pc and  km s@xmath3 , we have the following inseparable differential equation to solve @xmath106 where @xmath107 .      both ngc  1068 and ngc  4151 show evidence for highly ionized gas extended throughout their nlrs , based on chandra x - ray observatory images @xcite",
    "thus , we assume an ambient medium that is highly ionized , with ionization parameter @xmath108 10 .",
    "the ionization parameter , which is inversely related to the density and radius , can be written as follows @xmath109 therefore if the ambient and the nlr clouds see the same ionizing luminosity ( l@xmath110 ) at a particular distance @xmath10 from the source , we can write @xmath111 @xcite provided good constraints on the parameters on the right side of equation  [ ratio ] .",
    "the densities of the nlr clouds are almost constant out to large distances from the nucleus with a typical value of @xmath112 10@xmath113 @xmath114for clouds with @xmath115 10@xmath116",
    ". if we substitute these estimates in equation  [ ratio ] , we will have a typical estimate for @xmath117 as follows @xmath118 @xcite found column densities for the nlr clouds in the range @xmath119 = 10@xmath12010@xmath121 @xmath122 , which corresponds to @xmath123 = 0.110 . since we are interested in the ratio @xmath124 , varying either parameter while keeping the other constant will result in the same curves . in this paper",
    ", we choose to keep @xmath123 constant at the average value of 1 and vary @xmath117 , because @xmath117 is the most unknown quantity .",
    "we already know that @xmath58 can take values from 5006000 , so equation  [ diff ] can now be solved numerically for @xmath68 with various values of the launch radius ( @xmath85 ) , force multiplier ( @xmath125 ) , and the ratio @xmath124 .",
    "we used mathematica v5.2 , which employs the most efficient choices among various flavors of runge - kutta algorithms , to solve for @xmath68 .",
    "the results are presented in the next section .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fm_500_r_1_fm_6000_r_20 ]     shown by the numbers .",
    "+ bottom : the velocity profiles for a force multiplier of 6000 , a launch radius of 20 pc , and varying medium densities similar to the top panel.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    represents several plots with a force multiplier of 500 , a launch radius of 1 pc , a column density of @xmath123 = 1 , and various densities of the ambient medium .",
    "the figure shows that when launched at 1 pc , the gas accelerates to a maximum velocity inside 10 pc , then slows down again .",
    "the velocity slows down faster with increasing drag forces , as measured by increasing densities of the ambient medium .",
    "however the point of maximum velocity is too close in to match the data , which has a turnover velocity at @xmath4 140 pc .",
    "the curve with medium density @xmath117 = 0.33 shows gradual deceleration out to @xmath4 500 pc , but its maximum velocity is slightly too high .",
    "any other curve has either too high velocity at turnover or the velocity drops too quickly .",
    "note that the velocity of the data we are trying to match has @xmath4 2000  km s@xmath3at a turnover of @xmath4 140 pc for ngc  1068 . with force multipliers higher than 500 , the same trend as in figure  [ fm_500_r_1_fm_6000_r_20 ]",
    "is seen in the velocity model , except that the velocities are much higher ( @xmath1 6000  km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "again , the curve that seems best to match the deceleration part in the data is with medium density @xmath117 = 0.333 .",
    "the rest of the curves decelerate too quickly or too slowly .",
    "the major problem with all of these curves is that the velocity turnover point is much closer to the nucleus than 140 pc .",
    "another way to decrease the overall velocity is to increase the launch radius , and tweak the force multiplier and ambient density .",
    "we tried a launch radius of 10 pc with force multiplier ranging from 5006000 .",
    "the maximum velocity drops as expected , reaching @xmath0 700  km s@xmath3for a force multiplier of 500 and climbs to @xmath0 2500  km s@xmath3when we increase the force multiplier to 6000 .",
    "we noticed that the turning point increases by a factor of 5 as we increase the launch radius from 1 to 10 pc .",
    "however the turnover point is still too low to fit the data well . in order to have a good fit ,",
    "we first need to maximize the launch radius and then tweak the force multiplier and medium density to get the closest match to the data as possible .",
    "the resolution in our data is @xmath4 10 pc and we should not launch much beyond this distance since we see clouds close to the smbh with near zero velocity .",
    "therefore , in the bottom panel of figure  [ fm_500_r_1_fm_6000_r_20 ] , we present a plot with a launch radius of @xmath85 = 20 pc , a force multiplier of 6000 , and a column density of @xmath123 = 1 .",
    "the maximum velocity reached is @xmath4 1700  km s@xmath3with @xmath117 = 10 .",
    "the best curve to represent the data seems to be the one with @xmath117 = 0.33 , whose maximum velocity is @xmath4 1500  km s@xmath3 , although the turnover point at @xmath4 60 pc is still too low according to our kinematic model .",
    "furthermore , we have had to tweak the launch radius and force multiplier to very specific values , such that only a narrow range of the observed values gives a reasonably decent fit . however ,",
    "to directly test this velocity profile , we generate biconical models similar to our previous kinematic models ( paper ii ) , to determine whether a more dynamical velocity law , rather than the simple linear law , can reasonably match the data .",
    "we applied our kinematic models of paper ii with our dynamical velocity law to the data .",
    "previously we had used a simple kinematic velocity law , which is based on the relation @xmath126 .",
    "now instead we substitute the velocity relation based on equation  [ diff ] , which represented a more physical situation . a model with the new velocity law of equation  [ diff ]",
    "is presented in figure  [ r20fm6000nh3model ] ,    , and the best - fit velocity profile from the bottom panel of figure  [ fm_500_r_1_fm_6000_r_20 ] with @xmath117 = 0.33 .",
    "clearly this model is a poor match to the data.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    using the input parameters from table  [ tabsevena ] ,    cccccr 450 & 10 & 40 & 5 & 57.8 & equation  [ diff ] +    and using the best - fit curve from the bottom panel of figure  [ fm_500_r_1_fm_6000_r_20 ] , with @xmath123 = 1 and @xmath117 = 0.33 .",
    "our biconical model was constructed with an inner and outer half opening angle of 10@xmath127 and 40@xmath127 respectively , and inclination of 5@xmath127 , and position angle of 57.8@xmath127 , and a half - size of 450 pc .",
    "points on the bicone were assigned velocities according to equation  [ diff ] .",
    "the center slit ( slit 4 , see paper ii ) is used here for comparison .",
    "we extracted the velocities from the model at a position equivalent to slit 4 and those are shown in the shaded regions in figure  [ r20fm6000nh3model ] .",
    "the data from slit 4 are shown in small triangles .",
    "the model represents a poor fit to the data from slit 4 ( the center slit ) of ngc  1068 .",
    "this was expected from looking at the previous velocity plots , as the turnover point was too low , the launch radius was a bit large , and the velocity profile did not resemble our kinematically derived linear profiles .",
    "we have varied the input parameters from table  [ tabsevena ] , but this makes very little improvement .",
    "the turnover point , starting distance , and maximum velocity of the bicone can not be varied without changing the drag parameters , as these are implicitly defined in equation  [ diff ] .",
    "the thickness of the bicone can be increased to accommodate more data points , but the bicone will show lots of unnecessary shaded regions . changing the maximum extent of the bicone @xmath128 will have absolutely no effect on the shaded region , except interrupting the shaded regions before or continuing them beyond @xmath12 6 . that leaves us with only two parameters to vary , the inclination of the bicone axis , and its position angle in the sky , and varying these two alone did not fix the model .",
    "with radiation pressure driving the nlr clouds , their velocities will accelerate very quickly , within a few parsecs of the nucleus , assuming the clouds are indeed launched close in . with the introduction of the drag forces , the overall velocities are lowered , but even so the velocities reach maximum too quickly .",
    "the data suggest that the clouds are gradually increasing their velocities to a maximum at about 140 pc .",
    "this gradient in the velocity can not be simply accounted for by radiative forces driving the clouds .",
    "it seems therefore , that radiation pressure may not be the only driving mechanism for the nlr clouds , or that other forces are involved to steer the clouds to that particular gradient .",
    "the velocity profile shown in the data resembles one with a linear or ` hubble flow ' law .",
    "the inclusion of a drag force only serves to reduce the overall high velocities due to radiation driving , but the maximum velocities are reached very close to the nucleus , too close to match the data effectively .",
    "gravitational forces alone can not stop the fast moving clouds observed in the nlr of ngc  1068 . with velocities as high as 1500",
    "km s@xmath3at 140 pc , the clouds should have escaped the nlr . to compound the problem , when radiation forces are added , the cloud velocities are boosted even more . yet",
    "we see clouds that are slowing down and gradually reaching systemic velocity .",
    "therefore , the data suggest that there is a powerful force dragging on the clouds to slow their velocity .",
    "the drag force that we introduce can have a significant effect on the clouds velocities .",
    "we can conclude therefore that the drag forces are a strong competitor to the radiative forces , strong enough to bring the clouds to a halt even close to the nucleus , depending on the column densities of the outflowing clouds and the densities of the ambient medium .",
    "however the overall velocity profiles generated with radiative , gravitational , and drag forces do not match the data for ngc  1068 .",
    "assuming that the mass profile of ngc  4151 is similar to the one for ngc  1068 , it will prove difficult to match its observed velocity profile , because the same linear trends are seen in the velocity of the outflowing clouds .",
    "the same can be said for mkn 3 @xcite .",
