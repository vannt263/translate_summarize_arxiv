    "<S> the ferrimagnetic spinel mn@xmath0o@xmath1 exhibits large and anisotropic changes in electronic and structural properties in response to an applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> these changes are thought to result from the field - dependent tuning  via strong spin - lattice coupling  between two nearly degenerate magnetostructural phases . </S>",
    "<S> recent variable - magnetic - field studies of mn@xmath0o@xmath1 have been performed on melt - grown crystals , which can exhibit twin domains due to a jahn - teller structural transition below the melting temperature . </S>",
    "<S> because of the near degeneracy of the magnetostructural phases , however , strain associated with the twin domains likely affects the magnetic responses of mn@xmath0o@xmath1 . in this report </S>",
    "<S> , we present a variable - magnetic - field raman scattering study of untwinned mn@xmath0o@xmath1 crystals grown out of a flux below the jahn - teller structural transition . </S>",
    "<S> we measure distinct @xmath2 magnetic and vibrational excitation spectra for each isolated magnetostructural phase of untwinned mn@xmath0o@xmath1 crystals and determine the symmetries of the observed excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we determine how the magnetostructural phase mixture changes in response to magnetic fields applied in the magnetic easy plane . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , by comparing results on flux- and melt - grown mn@xmath0o@xmath1 crystals , we show that the intrinsic mixture of the two magnetostructural phases is indeed strongly influenced by the presence of twin domains . </S>"
