    "control over spin relaxation is essential to the operational capabilities of spin - based semiconductor devices  @xcite .",

    "the latter could be identified by means of optical experiments  @xcite in two - dimensional electronic systems with linear - in - momentum bychkov - rashba  @xcite and dresselhaus  @xcite type spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) ( here depending on the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively ) of equal magnitude . as had already been suggested in refs .",

    "recent experiments confirmed theoretical predictions that the wl signature persists for n - doped systems even in the presence of non - negligible intrinsic soi that scales with the cubic power of the wavenumber @xmath3",
    "the question naturally arises whether spin relaxation is also suppressed in p - doped semiconductors .",
    "therefore , in the present work we investigate the generalization of the psh symmetry arguments in the context of structurally confined heavy - hole ( hh ) states in iii - v semiconductors forming a two - dimensional hole gas ( 2dhg ) . in these materials",
    "the spin is subject to strong soi which typically enhance spin relaxation .",
    "this feature is mainly attributed to the carrier density dependence of the spin splitting , that has been investigated analytically by means of diagrammatic perturbation theory within the spherical approximation for one or more subbands  @xcite .",
    "other works consider weak ( anti- ) localization in hole gases based on a semianalytical  @xcite as well as a semiclassical and numerical  @xcite treatment of @xmath4 luttinger - kohn models  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on strong confinement described by an effective @xmath5 model of the hh ground state .",
    "our treatment is not restricted to the spherical or axial approximations , which significantly widens the range of observable phenomena compared to prior models .",
    "the low dimensionality allows for the identification of relevant symmetries that are used to deduce optimum parameter regimes for controlling spin relaxation .",

    "this does not hold for the dominant contribution by rashba soi , because the origin of the soi , which is connected with the coefficient @xmath27 , changes : in presence of the confinement , the contribution due to rashba soi in the effective hh system is dominated by the subband splitting between hh and lh .",
    "this dominant contribution is proportional to the term which is denoted here by @xmath27 .",

    "is closely connected with broken axial symmetry , since here a conserved quantity related to the spin degree of freedom can only be constructed in the presence of terms with both two- and threefold rotational symmetry in the extrinsic and the intrinsic soi .",
