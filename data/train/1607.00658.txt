    "zero forcing is an iterative graph coloring process where at each time step , a colored vertex with a single uncolored neighbor forces that neighbor to be colored ; the zero forcing number of a graph is the cardinality of the smallest set of initially colored vertices which causes the entire graph to be colored .",
    "zero forcing was introduced in an aim workshop on linear algebra and graph theory in 2006 @xcite and was used to bound the maximum nullity ( equivalently , the minimum rank ) of the family of symmetric matrices described by a graph . despite being np - hard to compute @xcite , the zero forcing number is generally more attainable than the maximum nullity , which makes it a valuable tool in the study of this algebraic parameter .",
    "in addition to its original linear algebraic application , zero forcing has found a variety of uses in physics , logic circuits , coding theory , power network monitoring , and in modeling the spread of diseases and information in social networks ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "the zero forcing number has also been used to bound or approximate various other graph parameters @xcite .",
    "closed formulas , characterizations , and bounds for the zero forcing number have been derived for graphs with special structure ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    a natural graph theoretic variant of zero forcing is obtained by requiring every set of initially colored vertices to induce a connected subgraph .",
    "this extension of zero forcing , called connected zero forcing , was introduced by brimkov and davila in @xcite ; that paper explored the differences and similarities between zero forcing and connected zero forcing , established several structural results about connected zero forcing sets , and characterized the connected zero forcing numbers of several families of graphs . a concurrent paper by davila et al .",
    "@xcite explored bounds on the connected zero forcing number in terms of other graph parameters .",
    "studying connected zero forcing can further the understanding of the forcing process and the underlying structure of forcing sets in general .",
    "moreover , in a connected graph @xmath0 , the connected zero forcing number is a sharp upper bound to the maximum nullity , path cover number , chromatic number minus one , and power domination number of @xmath0 @xcite . requiring a zero forcing set to be connected",
    "also has meaningful interpretations in many of the physical phenomena modeled by zero forcing .",
    "for example , it is often the case that ideas or diseases originate from a single connected source in a social network or geographic region ; thus , connected zero forcing may be better suited to model propagation in those scenarios .",
    "as another example , in the application of zero forcing to power network monitoring , one could imagine a scenario where in addition to the production cost of the phase measurement units , there is a significant cost to dispatch a technician to install and maintain the units .",
    "thus , an electric power company may seek to place all measurement devices in a compact , connected region in the network so that a technician can be sent on a single trip to install or maintain the devices , in addition to installing the smallest number of devices necessary to monitor the entire system .",
    "other variants of zero forcing , such as positive semidefinite zero forcing and signed zero forcing , have also been studied .",
    "these are typically obtained by modifying the color change rule or adding certain restrictions to zero forcing , and are often designed to bound different linear algebraic parameters . for example , in the positive semidefinite variant , the zero forcing color change rule acts separately on certain induced subgraphs ; the minimum cardinality sets which force a graph using this modified rule are used to study the maximum nullity of the positive semidefinite matrices described by the graph ( cf .",
    "similarly , the signed variant can be used to bound the maximum nullity of a matrix with a given sign pattern @xcite .",
    "another related graph parameter whose connected variant has been investigated is the domination number  the minimum cardinality of a vertex set @xmath1 which contains or is adjacent to every vertex in the graph ; requiring @xmath1 to be connected results in the connected domination number , which has distinct properties and applications .",
    "connected domination has been extensively studied , e.g. , in @xcite ; both domination and connected domination are np - complete @xcite , with the latter generally being harder to solve exactly",
    ". nevertheless , there are some strategies to improve on a brute force enumeration algorithm despite the non - locality of the connected domination problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    as one of the main results of this paper , we establish the np - completeness of connected zero forcing .",
    "thus , as with zero forcing , this problem can not be solved efficiently in general , but there can be bounds in terms of other graph parameters and characterizations for specific graphs . to this end , we give two lower bounds on the connected zero forcing number in terms of certain vertices and induced subgraphs in the graph .",
    "we also characterize the connected zero forcing numbers of unicyclic graphs and some variants of cactus and block graphs .",
    "related parameters of such graphs have been investigated in the past ( and sometimes rediscovered ) : for example , @xcite and @xcite give polynomial time algorithms for the path cover number of trees ; @xcite and @xcite respectively show that for trees , the path cover number equals the maximum nullity and the zero forcing number ; @xcite gives a linear time algorithm for the connected zero forcing number of trees and characterizes graphs in which it equals the zero forcing number ; @xcite and @xcite show that in block graphs , the maximum nullity equals the zero forcing number ; @xcite surveys several characterizations and gives polynomial time algorithms for the maximum nullity and path cover number of unicyclic graphs ; @xcite and @xcite show that the zero forcing number of unicyclic graphs and cactus graphs equals the path cover number ; @xcite characterizes the power domination number of block graphs .    in general , since connectivity is a global property , non - local problems like connected zero forcing are typically much harder to solve exactly than their non - connected analogues . however , there are some other simple cases where efficient computation is possible .",
    "if the connected zero forcing number @xmath2 is known to be very small or very large , an enumeration approach can be used to find a minimum connected zero forcing set in polynomial time .",
    "for example , if @xmath3 , it can be checked whether each of the @xmath4 sets of vertices of appropriate size is connected and forcing in @xmath5 time , so @xmath2 can be computed in @xmath6 time .",
    "an enumeration approach can also be used to efficiently compute the connected zero forcing number of graphs with polynomially many connected induced subgraphs ; see @xcite for another dynamic graph coloring process which can be solved efficiently in such graphs . in the last part of the paper , we identify some graphs in which even a greedy algorithm can be used to obtain a minimum connected zero forcing set ; for some of these graphs , the collection of all connected zero forcing sets can be used to define greedoids and matroids .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we recall some graph theoretic notions , specifically those related to zero forcing . in section 3",
    ", we obtain some novel structural results about connected zero forcing , and recall some results from @xcite which are used in the sequel . in section 4 , we prove that connected zero forcing is np - complete . in section 5 , we give closed formulas for the connected zero forcing numbers of unicyclic graphs , and variants of cactus graphs and block graphs . in section 6 , we establish a connection between connected zero forcing sets and accessible set systems .",
    "we conclude with some final remarks and open questions in section 7 .",

    "dictates that at each integer - valued time step , a colored vertex @xmath29 with a single uncolored neighbor @xmath14 _ forces _ that neighbor to become colored ; such a _ force _ is denoted @xmath30 .",
    "the _ derived set _ of @xmath1 is the set of colored vertices obtained after the color change rule is applied until no new vertex can be forced ; it can be shown that the derived set of @xmath1 is uniquely determined by @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "a _ chronological list of forces _ of @xmath1 is a sequence of forces applied to obtain the derived set of @xmath1 in the order they are applied ; there can also be initially colored vertices which do not force any vertex .",
    "generally , the chronological list of forces is not uniquely determined by @xmath1 ; for example , it may be possible for several colored vertices to force an uncolored vertex at a given step .",

    "thus , each forcing chain induces a distinct path in @xmath0 , one of whose endpoints is an initially colored vertex , and all other vertices are uncolored at the initial time step ; we will say the initially colored vertex _ initiates _ the forcing chain .",

    ", we may refer to these as _ connected forcing set _ and _ connected forcing number_. note that a disconnected graph can never have a connected forcing set .",
    "an important concept to studying and understanding the zero forcing process is that of _ zero forcing spread _ of a vertex @xmath14 and edge @xmath35 in graph @xmath0 ; these parameters , defined as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , describe the effects of deleting a vertex or edge from the graph on the zero forcing number of the graph .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the zero forcing spread of any vertex or edge is bounded by 1 ; more precisely , for any graph @xmath0 , vertex @xmath14 , and edge @xmath35 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in @xcite , the analogous concept of _ connected forcing spread _ of a non - articulation vertex @xmath14",
    "was defined as @xmath40 , and it was shown that unlike the zero forcing spread , the connected forcing spread of a vertex can be arbitrarily large :    _ @xcite _ for any @xmath41 and @xmath42 , there exist graphs @xmath26 and @xmath27 and vertices @xmath43 and @xmath44 such that @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "<S> zero forcing is an iterative graph coloring process whereby a colored vertex with a single uncolored neighbor forces that neighbor to be colored . </S>",
    "<S> it is np - hard to find a minimum zero forcing set  a smallest set of initially colored vertices which forces the entire graph to be colored . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the problem remains np - hard when the initially colored set induces a connected subgraph . </S>",
    "<S> we also give structural results about the connected zero forcing sets of a graph related to the graph s density , separating sets , and certain induced subgraphs , and we characterize the cardinality of the minimum connected zero forcing sets of unicyclic graphs and variants of cactus and block graphs . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we identify several families of graphs whose connected zero forcing sets define greedoids and matroids .    </S>",
