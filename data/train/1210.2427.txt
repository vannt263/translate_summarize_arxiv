    "the attitude of physicists towards singular solutions of classical field theories , in particular theories of gravitation , has changed along time . in the case of general relativity ( gr ) this change went from plain rejection to _ reification_. after significant advances in the understanding of singular space - time models during the 1990s , made by both physicists and philosophers ( clarke 1993 , earman 1995 ) , an attitude of caution , even skepticism , has emerged .",
    "this paper is a plea for intolerance about singularities .",
    "i shall argue that einstein s attitude towards singular solutions of gr was well - motivated and essentially correct .",
    "my thesis can be simply stated : _ there are no singularities_. there are only singular space - time models , and they are defective representations of reality .    my _ blitz _ against singularities will follow a simple plan .",
    "i start in the next section briefly discussing the relation between conceptual ways of representation and reality .",
    "then , i formulate a simple ontological basis of gr . in the subsequent sections i review the standard definitions of singular space - times , and i discuss the ontological import of such models . if there are no singularities in gr , what are its main referents ?",
    "a final section is devoted to this issue .",
    "i close reviewing the highlights and prospects .",
    "we all make a basic assumption when doing science : there is a reality to be known . without the postulate of the independent existence of a real world",
    "the scientific enterprise would be vain .",
    "i shall not discuss this primary assumption here .",
    "rather , i want to focus on how we represent reality in our attempts to understand it .    in order to build representations of the world we use conceptual systems called _ languages_. in ordinary life natural languages such as english , german or spanish are , or",
    "seem to be , enough . if we want to penetrate deeper into the structure of reality , however , we need formal and less vague languages like those provided by logic and mathematics .    essentially , a formal language is a system of signs with a set of explicit rules to generate valid combinations of symbols ( see , for instance , the treatises by bunge 1974a , b and martin 1978 ) .",
    "these rules give instructions about how valid arrangements of symbols ( called _ formulas _ ) are formed ( _ syntactic rules _ ) , or they relate symbols and formulas with extra - linguistic objects ( _ semantic rules _ ) .",
    "the operation of _ deduction _ allows to obtain valid formulas from valid formulas .",
    "if a set of formulas is closed under deduction , we call it a _ theory_. any _ interpreted _ theory , with the help of auxiliary conditions , should produce _ statements _ about states of affairs that occur in the world .",
    "if a state of affairs can be used to validate a statement and this statement satisfies truth conditions in the theory , we say that the theory ( actually one of its models ) _ represents _ some aspect of the world .",
    "the use of formal languages in science brings many advantages , to the point that those specific scientific disciplines that do not make intensive use of formal methods are generally underdeveloped . clarity and precision",
    "are gained through formalization .",
    "this results in a significant reduction of the vagueness that is inherent to natural languages .",
    "the extensive use of formalized languages , besides , enables us to elicit in a systematic way the consequences of our assumptions .",
    "the adoption of the special class of formalized languages of mathematics makes possible to introduce quantitative and complex representations of the properties and changes we detect in the world .",
    "a basic assumption of factual science is that a property can be represented by some mathematical function .",
    "reality is not mathematical , but certainly our more accurate representations of it are mathematical .",
    "physical systems , in general , are described by models where properties and processes are represented by mathematical constructs .",
    "models , in this way , are representations of the mechanisms we assume occur in physical systems .",
    "this is so to the extent that _ to explain _ a thing is to unveil the mechanisms that operate in it , i.e. to faithfully represent the manifold of physical processes with a coherent system of mathematical functions and constructs ( bunge 2006 )    sometimes , in highly elaborated theories , however , formalization can reach such a degree of complexity that the semantics of the language might be difficult to elucidate .",
    "this results in problems of interpretation and is a source of confusion .",
    "quantum mechanics and quantum field theories , for instance , are highly formal theories whose interpretations are still matter of strong controversy .",
    "there is no agreement even on what the referents of these theories are .",
    "this is an unfortunate situation that should be settled by logic , semantical analysis , and even experiment ( see , e.g. , bunge 1967 ; perez - bergliaffa et al .",
    "1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "general relativity is not free of this sort of problems .",
    "the complexity of the field equations , which are non - linear , and the interpretation of the metric tensor field have resulted in concerns on the ontological assumptions of the theory .",
    "general relativity is one of the several , and certainly the most important , theories of the geometrization program of physics launched in the second decade of the 20th century ( for a review of the program see vizgin 1994 ) .",
    "although several first - rate theoreticians , such as weyl , considered gr as a theory of space - time , susceptible , in principle , to be expanded to encompass also electromagnetic phenomena , einstein initial attitude from 1915 and up to 1919 was more cautious . in a letter to sommerfeld written towards the end of 1915 ,",
    "einstein said ( cited in vizgin 1994 ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ gr ] essentially gives a law of the gravitational field , doing this , moreover , completely uniquely if the requirement of general covariance is satisfied .",

    "he even noticed that ( einstein 1916 ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ an atom must , because of the intra - atomic motion of the electron , emit not only electromagnetic but also gravitational energy , albeit in a negligible amount .",
    "since nothing like this occurs in reality , it is evident that quantum theory must modify not only maxwellian electrodynamics but also the new theory of gravitation [ gr ] .",

    "although at the end of the decade of 1910 einstein thought of the metric of space - time as a tensor field whose role in gr was to represent the gravitational potential , as time went by he shifted towards a full geometrization of physics .",
    "he started then to look for suitable generalizations of gr that could accommodate electrodynamics .",
    "he also searched for particle - like solutions of different field equations in order to accomplish the incorporation of the discreteness required by the quantum aspects of reality ( van dongen 2010 ) .",
    "his intolerance to space - time singularities remained , nonetheless , unshakable .",
    "general relativity is said sometimes to be a ` a theory of space and time ' .",
    "we read , for instance , in the classic textbook by misner , thorne , and wheeler ( 1973 ) :  space acts on matter , telling it how to move . in turn",
    ", matter reacts back on space , telling it how to curve\". the concept of space - time , however , is presupposed by all classical field theories .",
    "the concept was introduced by minkowski ( 1908 ) , and belongs more to ontology than to physics ( romero 2012a ) .",
    "a formal construction of space - time can be obtained starting from an ontological basis of either things ( perez - bergliaffa et al .",
    "1998 ) or events ( romero 2012b ) . in",
    "what follows i provide a simple outline of the relation between space - time and gr .",
    "the basic ontological assumption is : + p0 - ontological .",
    "_ space - time is the ontological composition of all events_. + events can be considered as primitives or can be derived from things as changes in their properties if things are taken as ontologically prior .",
    "both representations are equivalent since things can be construed as bundles of events ( romero 2012b ) .",
    "since composition is not a formal operation but an ontological one , space - time is not a concept nor an abstraction , but an emergent entity . as any entity , space - time can be represented by a concept .",
    "the usual representation of space - time is given by a 4-dimensional manifold @xmath0 equipped with a metric field @xmath1 :    @xmath2    i insist : space - time is not a manifold ( i.e. a mathematical construct ) but the `` totality '' of all events .",
    "a specific model of space - time requires the specification of the source of the metric field .",
    "this is done through another field , called the `` energy - momentum '' tensor field @xmath3 .",
    "hence , a model of space - time can be denoted by the following triplet :    @xmath4    the relation between both tensor fields is given by einstein s field equations .",
    "the metric field represents the gravitational potential .",
    "the energy - momentum field , the potential of change in space - time .",

    "we need three additional semantical postulates of physical nature .",

    "+ @xmath24 the energy - momentum tensor field @xmath3 represents the energy - momentum distribution of the physical systems other than the gravitational field .",
    "+ @xmath25 the constant @xmath26 gives the strength of the coupling between the gravitational and non - gravitational fields .",
    "its value is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the gravitational and vacuum speed of light constant , respectively . + some comments are in order . first , with the interpretation given by the last 3 postulates , eqs .",
    "( [ eq - einstein ] ) express a law of nature : the law of gravitational field .",
    "the equations , just a formal constraint so far , become einstein s field equations .",
    "second , the energy - momentum tensor expresses the potential of a physical system to change .",
    "the more a system can change , the more energy it has .",
    "energy , then , is not a thing , but a property : the most general of all properties , shared by all things .",
    "it is the capability of changing ( bunge 1977 ) .",
    "changes are events , so energy reflects the structure of space - time ( the composition of all events ) . finally , singularities are features of some solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq - einstein ] ) .",
    "hence , they appear in our representations of st and not in space - time itself .",
    "a space - time model is said to be _ singular _ if the manifold @xmath0 defined in the previous section is _",
    "incomplete_. a manifold is incomplete if it contains at least one _ inextendible _ curve .",

    "an outline of the proof of the theorem is given in the appendix .",
    "singularity theorems are not theorems that imply physical existence , under some conditions , of space - time singularities . material existence can not be formally implied .",
    "existence theorems imply that under certain assumptions there are functions that satisfy a given equation , or that some concepts can be formed in accordance with some explicit syntactic rules .",
    "theorems of this kind state the possibilities and limits of some formal system or language .",
    "the conclusion of the theorems , although not obvious in many occasions , are always a necessary consequence of the assumptions made .    in the case of singularity theorems of classical field theories like gr , what is implied is that under some assumptions the solutions of the equations of the theory are defective beyond repair .",
    "the correct interpretation of these theorems is that they point out the _ incompleteness _ of the theory : there are statements that can not be made within the theory . in this sense ( and only in this sense ) , the theorems are like gdel s famous theorems of mathematical logic .",
    "to interpret the singularity theorems as theorems about the existence of certain space - time models is wrong .",
