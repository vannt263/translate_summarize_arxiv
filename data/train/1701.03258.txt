    "since the iron - based superconductors were discovered  @xcite , the families of iron pnictides and chalcogenides display very rich phase diagrams , including antiferromagnetism or spin - density wave  @xcite , superconductivity  @xcite , structural / magnetic phase transitions  @xcite , orbital ordering  @xcite and nematic ordered phase  @xcite , _ etc._. the proximity of magnetism and superconductivity suggests the spin degree of freedom plays a key role in understanding the basic low - energy physics of the iron - based superconductors . and",
    "spin fluctuations have been proposed as the unconventional superconducting mechanism of iron - based superconductors  @xcite .",
    "thus , to understand the magnetic properties is a primary task in uncovering the microscopic mechanism of the iron - based superconductivity .    through many magnetic measurements , mainly with the help of the neutron scattering techniques , various antiferromagnetic ( afm ) structures in different ironpnictide compounds",
    "have been determined ; the 1111 ( rfeaso with r = rare - earth ions ) , the 111 ( afeas with a = alkali metal ions , _",
    "e.g. _ na ) and the 122 phases ( afe@xmath0as@xmath0 with a = alkaline earth metal ions , _ e.g. _ ba , and rfe@xmath0as@xmath0 with r = rare - earth ions , _",
    "e.g. _ eu ) , possess striped afm ( safm ) order  @xcite , while fete is bi - collinear afm ( bafm )  @xcite , _ etc._. among these compounds , the parent compounds with magnetic rare - earth ions , such as rfeaso ( r = ce , pr , nd , sm , gd and tb ) and eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 , have demonstrated particular interesting .",
    "smfeaso@xmath1f@xmath2 shows the maximum t@xmath3 with about 55 k  @xcite , in other iron - pnictides with magnetic rare - earth ions , the t@xmath3 is about 41 k for ce  @xcite , 52 k for pr  @xcite , and 51 k for nd  @xcite .",
    "however , in eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 , the t@xmath3 is only about 29.5 k  @xcite .",
    "since the basic feas units are very similar in these systems , the superconducting transition temperatures t@xmath3 are very different , indicating a possibly distinct magnetic interaction between rare - earth and fe layers in different compounds , and these distinct magnetic coupling is crucial in promoting the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "especially , these magnetic rare - earth ions exhibit different magnetic interactions , resulting in a more complicated magnetic behaviors .",
    "for example , in 1111 system , the rare earth ions of rfeaso are afm , and undergo an afm - paramagnetic phase transition at t@xmath4  @xcite . while in 122 system , such as in eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 , eu@xmath5 ions display a ferromagnetic ( fm ) ordering  @xcite , _ etc._. a series of experiments had been performed to investigate the role of the magnetic rare - earth ions on the fe-3@xmath6 magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "meanwhile , the influence of magnetic field on these complicated magnetic ordering are also investigated using static and pulsed field techniques .",
    "it is found when a magnetic field is applied in eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 , a spin flop transition occurs in rear - earth eu layer observed experimentally at a very low magnetic field  @xcite . in addition , in smfeaso , at a high pulsed magnetic field , a spin - flop like transition is also observed  @xcite .",
    "these experiments have demonstrated that in ironpnictide superconductors the magnetic structures under magnetic field display a complex phenomenon .",
    "thus , a question naturally arises : what role do the magnetic rare - earth ions and magnetic field play on the magnetism and superconductivity of the feas layers in these rare - earth compounds ? to address this question , a detail theoretical investigation is expected . in this paper",
    ", we present the effect of magnetic rare - earth ions and magnetic field on the magnetism of iron pnictide compounds and investigate the interplay of magnetic rear - earth and fe ions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : a model hamiltonian and the cluster self - consistent field ( cluster - scf ) method are described in sec.ii ; then the results and discussions are presented in sec .",
    "iii ; the last section is devoted to the remarks and conclusions .",
    "it has been shown that the effective heisenberg models provide a reasonable description for the magnetic structure and spin wave behaviors in the iron - based superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7-@xmath8 frustrated heisenberg model was firstly proposed to describe the magnetic properties of the iron - based superconductors . while , the inelastic neutron scattering experiments found a large in - plane anisotropy in the magnetic interactions  @xcite , suggesting the magnetic exchange constants @xmath9 with @xmath10 denoting the afm direction and @xmath11 the fm direction .",
    "thus an effective @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath8 model could well describe the striped afm ( safm ) order in iron - based compounds  @xcite . here",
    "we start from the @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath8 heisenberg model .",
    "+    an effective @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath8 heisenberg model for iron - based compounds is described as , @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) magnetic exchange constants with spin @xmath18 of fe ions , respectively ; @xmath19 is the interlayer coupling along the @xmath20-axis and @xmath21 is the single - ion anisotropy energy of fe ions .",
    "notice that @xmath22 is given according to the experimental results , @xmath22=@xmath23 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath10 direction ) for fe spins in both eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 and smfeaso compounds .",
    "we consider the magnetic couplings in the rare - earth layer as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the rare - earth spin , @xmath26 is the nn magnetic exchange constants of intralayer rare - earth spins , @xmath27 is the interlayer coupling along the @xmath20-axis , @xmath28 is the single - ion anisotropy energy of rare - earth ions , and @xmath22=@xmath23 for eu spins in eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 and @xmath22=@xmath29 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath20 direction ) for sm spins in smfeaso . and",
    "we also consider the interlayer coupling between the rare - earth ( r ) and feas layers : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the coupling between r and fe ions .",
    "it is known that the external magnetic field is an effective tool to modulate the spin degree of freedom . in this paper",
    "we mainly consider two kinds of magnetic field , one ( @xmath32 ) is applied along the direction of @xmath10 or @xmath11 axis of the magnetic unit cell , and another ( @xmath33 ) is perpendicular to it ( _ i.e. _ along the direction of @xmath20 axis ) . in general ,",
    "the external magnetic field is described as @xmath34 where @xmath35 depends on the direction of the magnetic field , where @xmath23 ( @xmath29 ) along @xmath10 ( @xmath20 ) axis of the magnetic unit cell .",
    "thus the total hamiltonian of the system is @xmath36 .    in order to treat with the spin correlations and fluctuations including short - range ones accurately , we adopt the cluster self - consistent field ( cluster - scf ) method developed by us to solve this anisotropic heisenberg model .",
    "the main idea of this method as follows : we divide the lattice into a central cluster plus surrounding spins , treat the magnetic interactions of the spins inside the cluster exactly , and the couplings of surrounding spins outside the cluster is treated as self - consistent `` molecular '' fields . the details could be found in refs .  @xcite . here",
    "we extend our method to deal with the heisenberg model including the nnn interaction , such as @xmath7-@xmath8 and @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath8 models , _ etc._. as an example to verify our approach , we calculated the phase diagram of @xmath7-@xmath8 heisenberg model with spin @xmath37 on a square lattice , and the result is shown in fig .",
    "it is clearly shown that our phase diagram is good agreement with these obtained by other methods , such as series expansions  @xcite and coupled cluster  @xcite methods , demonstrating the effectiveness and validity of our cluster - scf method .    to solve this heisenberg model ,",
    "the magnetic exchange parameters should be given firstly . in order to compare the different rare - earth layers",
    ", we use the same parameters for fe layers in both rfe@xmath0as@xmath0 and rfeaso systems . here",
    "we adopt the parameters for fe layers with @xmath38=59.9 mev , @xmath39=@xmath409.2 mev , @xmath41=13.6 mev and @xmath42=1.8 mev according to the inelastic neutron scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "and we estimate the single - ion anisotropy energy parameter @xmath21=0.07 mev . note",
    "that we estimate the single - ion anisotropy energy parameters within spin - wave theory with a relationship @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is spin gap  @xcite in this paper . for rfe@xmath0as@xmath0 case , considering n@xmath45el transition temperature t@xmath46=19 k for eu layer in eufe@xmath0as@xmath0  @xcite , we choose @xmath47=@xmath400.8 mev , @xmath27=0.4 mev and @xmath28=0.2 mev . due to the large magnetic moment",
    "@xmath48=6.9 @xmath49  @xcite , the spin @xmath50 for eu ion is treated in a classical level .",
    "meanwhile the spin @xmath51 for fe ion is considered in a quantum level .",

    "the spin for r = ce , pr , nd , sm , gd and tb ions is also calculated with a classical value @xmath54  @xcite due to a small magnetic moment ( _ e.g. _ about 0.83 @xmath49 for cefeaso ) for rear - earth ions in rfeaso compounds  @xcite . the clusters and magnetic exchange couplings of rfe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( r = eu ) and rfeaso ( r = ce , pr , nd , sm , gd and tb ) compounds are shown in fig .",
    "utilizing the cluster - scf method , we study the influence of magnetic field and the coupling between fe and rare - earth spins on the magnetic ground states and magnetic phase transition both in rfe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( r = eu ) and in rfeaso ( r = ce , pr , nd , sm , gd and tb ) systems . in the following ,",
    "we address the detailed results for these two systems for comparison .",
    "we find that in the stable magnetic ground state of rfe@xmath0as@xmath0 with r = eu , the fe spins in feas layer are safm with interlayer afm ; meanwhile , the eu@xmath5 spins in the rare - earth layers are ferromagnetic ( fm ) with the interlayer afm .",
    "notice that the spin directions of both eu@xmath5 and fe@xmath5 ions align in the @xmath10-@xmath11 plane . according to the analysis of the symmetry of the magnetic structure ,",
    "the influence of rare - earth ions on fe ions is canceled in the absence of magnetic field within the present mean field approximation .",
    "once the magnetic field is applied , the magnetic rare - earth ions would contribute an effective molecular field on fe spins .",
    "our results show that when a magnetic field ( @xmath55 or @xmath56 ) is applied , the system undergoes a series of complicated magnetic phase transitions . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and ( b ) , the magnetic field dependence of total magnetization per formula ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) globally displays similar behavior for @xmath55 and @xmath56 . with the increase of the magnetic field , @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "first undergo a lift steeply , and then almost linearly increase to a saturated value .",
    "however , the detail of @xmath57 displays a lot of difference from that of @xmath58 .",
    "the total magnetization @xmath57 of eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 displays two sharp phase transitions under the parallel magnetic filed @xmath55 : the first one corresponds to the spin flop transition of eu@xmath5 spins and the second one to that of fe@xmath5 spins , as seen in the two insets of fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "the critical magnetic field of the spin - flop transition for eu@xmath5 ions , @xmath59(eu ) , is about 0.02@xmath12 ( @xmath609 t ) .",
    "in fact , due to the low critical magnetic field , the spin - flop transition for eu@xmath5 ions is observed in the experiments  @xcite . while for a perpendicular magnetic field ( @xmath56 ) , no spin - flop transition is observed , only a successive afm - fm transition corresponds a canted magnetism of rare - earth ions .",
    "when the magnetic field becomes strong enough , the total magnetization ferromagnetically saturates in both cases .",
    "the atom - resolved magnetization contributed from eu@xmath5 and fe@xmath5 ions are plotted for @xmath55 and @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , one can see that when applied parallel magnetic field ( @xmath55 ) becomes larger than a critical field @xmath61 , the magnetization components @xmath62 and @xmath63 of eu ions suffer a sharp change , corresponding to a spin flop transition . with the further increase of @xmath64 ,",
    "the magnetic eu ions enter into a canted phase , until into a saturated fm phase .",
    "in contrast , for a perpendicular magnetic field ( @xmath56 ) , once the magnetic field is applied , the system gradually transits to a canted phase , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "one notices that at @xmath61 , there is no influence of fe ions on the rare - earth ions due to the cancellation of the afm molecular fields within the present mean field approximation .    as a comparison with rare - earth 4@xmath65 spins , the magnetic phase transitions of fe-3@xmath6 magnetism are similar , but occurs at a relatively large magnetic field . from fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) with @xmath66a , it is clearly found that the critical parallel magnetic field of spin - flop for fe@xmath5 ion ( @xmath59(fe ) ) is about 0.288@xmath12 ( @xmath60130 t ) , which is not observed experimentally due to its large @xmath59(fe ) .",
    "thus fe - spin flop phenomenon may only be observed experimentally in a strong pulsed magnetic field .",
    "in fact , the effect of r ions on fe ions is equivalent to an effective molecular field , about 0.11@xmath12 at @xmath67 .",
    "this shows that the 4@xmath65-magnetism could considerably affect the fe-3@xmath6 magnetic properties under magnetic field .    to further uncover the influence of magnetic field on the magnetic structures in eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 , we display the evolution of magnetic structure on the magnetic field @xmath64 in fig .",

    "[ fig5](a ) , from which one observes that the spin - flop transitions of eu spins and fe spins occur at the second and fifth stage , respectively ; and under perpendicular field @xmath56 , the system evolves from ( 1 ) eu(fm - af)-af - fe(safm - af ) , ( 2 ) eu(fm - canted)-af - fe(canted - canted ) , ( 3 ) eu(fm - fm)-af - fe(canted - canted ) , to ( 4 ) eu(fm - fm)-f - fe(fm - fm ) , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) .    in simple systems , it is known that the critical magnetic field of the spin - flop transition is proportional to the single - ion anisotropy energy . in the present complicated magnetic systems , however , due to the interlayer coupling between eu@xmath5 and fe@xmath5 ions , the variation of the critical magnetic field is very complex , as seen in fig .",
    "it shows that the fm interlayer coupling between rare - earth and fe ions ( @xmath680 ) favors the occurrence of the fe - spin flop transition ; however , the afm interlayer coupling ( @xmath690 ) is unfavorable of the transition .",
    "furthermore , the interlayer coupling between rare - earth ions , @xmath27 , also strongly affects the spin - flop transition ; for the fm ( afm ) interlayer coupling between rare - earth and fe ions , @xmath27 , _ i.e. _ the afm coupling between magnetic rare - earth ions , unfavors ( favors ) the occurrence of the fe spin - flop transition .",
    "in addition , the intralayer coupling of rare - earth ions , @xmath47 , does not affect this transition .",
    "actually , the magnetism of 4@xmath65 electrons in rfeaso ( r = ce , pr , nd , sm gd and tb ) is very different from that in rfe@xmath0as@xmath0 . in order to investigate the magnetic interplay between 4@xmath65 and 3@xmath6 electrons",
    ", we also calculate the magnetic properties of rfeaso ( r = sm ) . for rfeaso ( r = sm )",

    "the spin directions of sm@xmath5 and fe@xmath5 ions align along the @xmath20 axis and in the @xmath10-@xmath11 plane , respectively . as a consequence , when a magnetic field ( @xmath55 or @xmath56 ) is applied , the system undergoes a complex magnetic phase transition and is different from eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 . as shown in fig .",

    "this is very different from the eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 shown above .",
    "the atom - resolved magnetizations of sm@xmath5 and fe@xmath5 ions in smfeaso are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) , it is obviously found that the critical magnetic field of spin - flop for sm@xmath5 ions ( @xmath59(sm ) ) is about 0.08@xmath12 ( @xmath6036 t ) , considerably larger than the critical value in eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "in fact , this spin - flop transition of sm@xmath5 ions was observed in a strong pulsed magnetic field in a recent experiment  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to eu ions in 122 system , the influence of the molecular field of fe spins on sm spins is significant due to different magnetic polarized axis of fe and sm ions , which contributes to a weak effective field about 0.0007@xmath12 on sm spins .",
    "meanwhile , we find that the critical magnetic field of spin - flop for fe@xmath5 ions ( @xmath59(fe ) ) is relatively large , about 0.364@xmath12 ( @xmath60164 t ) .",
    "this critical value is slightly larger than that of eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "the reason is that the magnetic field should firstly overcome the intralayer afm coupling between sm ions before the spin - flop transition occurs .",
    "and the effective field contributed from sm ions on fe ions is about 0.035@xmath12 .    the evolution of magnetic structure in smfeaso on applied magnetic field @xmath64 is displayed in fig .",
    "with the same definition to last section , one finds that with the increase of the magnetic field , the system undergoes the following stages : under @xmath55 case , the system undergoes from ( 1 ) r(nafm - af)-af - fe(safm - af ) , ( 2 ) r(canted - canted)-af - fe(safm - af ) , ( 3 ) r(canted - canted)-af - fe(spin - flop - safm - af ) , ( 4 ) r(fm - fm)-af - fe(canted - canted ) , to ( 5 ) r(fm - fm)-f - fe(fm - fm ) ; and under @xmath56 case , the system undergoes from ( 1 ) r(nafm - af)-af - fe(safm - af ) , ( 2 ) r(nafm - af)-af - fe(canted - canted ) , ( 3 ) r(spin - flop - nafm - af)-af - fe(canted - canted ) , ( 4 ) r(canted - canted)-af - fe(canted - canted ) , ( 5 ) r(fm - fm)-af - fe(canted - canted ) , to ( 6 ) r(fm - fm)-f - fe(fm - fm ) , obviously different from these in eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 compounds .    in smfeaso ,",
    "the dependence of critical magnetic field of the fe - spin flop ( @xmath59(fe ) ) on the interlayer coupling @xmath31 and @xmath27 under @xmath55 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10](a ) , which exhibits similar tendency of eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 case .",
    "the only difference is that no an effective magnetic field like fm of eu ions is needed to overcome due to the afm configuration in the rare - earth layers .",
    "in contrast to the case of eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 , the intralayer coupling of rare - earth ions @xmath47 also significantly affects the critical magnetic field value of the fe spin - flop transition , since additional magnetic field is needed to overcome the afm coupling between r spins . in the case of cefeaso",

    "meanwhile , the neutron scattering experiments find that the interlayer magnetic coupling between r and fe spins ( _ i.e. _ @xmath31 ) in cefeaso is stronger than those in smfeaso , showing that the weak interlayer coupling in smfeaso favors the spin fluctuations in feas layers , hence more high superconducting transition temperature . also we expect that a small magnetic anisotropic energy of rare - earth spins , @xmath28 , favors the spin fluctuations of fe spins , thus enhances the pairing force and t@xmath3 .",
    "in summary , we investigate the magnetic phase transition behavior in both 1111 and 122 systems with 4@xmath65-electrons .",
    "our results demonstrate that the interplay of 3@xmath6 and 4@xmath65 spins plays a key role in the magnetic field dependence of these iron - based superconductors with magnetic rare - earth ions .",
    "the magnetic rare - earth layers , like magnetic intercalated layers , can tune the spin flop transition of the square fe lattice in iron - based compounds .",
