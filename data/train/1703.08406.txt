    "the _ bitcoin network _ is a payment system where all transactions between participants are carried out in the digital bitcoin currency .",
    "these transactions are stored in a database called _",
    "blockchain_. in fact , every bitcoin user maintains a blockchain version , thus keeping track of the global bitcoin transaction history .",
    "this ensures transparency  one of the advertized bitcoin features .",
    "information spreads across the network via peer - to - peer communication .",
    "all transactions get broadcast , and certain users arrange them into blocks suitable to add to the blockchain .",
    "the blocks get broadcast , too , and other users update their blockchain versions as soon as they hear of new blocks .",
    "it is vital for the network to synchronize as soon as possible because the bitcoin payment system is trustworthy to the degree it is synchronized .",
    "this explains the need for models that capture the desyncronization caused by communication delays .",
    "due to such delays , some bitcoin users are not up to date compared to others , meaning that their blockchain versions lack some blocks compared to the blockchain versions of others .",
    "this desynchronization effect motivates the model analyzed in the present paper .",
    "it can be seen as a seemingly minor modification of a conventional queueing system , but this modification gives rise to various unexpected features and , overall , intrinsically different behavior .",
    "in our model we assume bitcoin - like communication between two parties , where party  a generates pieces of information and sends them off to party b , and b receives these information pieces with delay , i.e.  b is not up to date compared to a. such communication can be described by an infinite - server model where newly generated information pieces correspond to arrivals and their transmission corresponds to receiving service at parallel servers .",
    "an unconventional feature of this model is that customers do interact here ( usually , in infinite - server models , customers do not interfere and act independently , which often facilitates explicit analysis ) .",
    "this interaction is inspired by the following mechanism in the blockchain dynamics .",
    "in the blockchain , each next block contains a reference to the previous one .",
    "suppose participant b receives a block from participant a who knows more than b , and this new block does not directly link to b s last block .",
    "then b requests from a the new block s predecessors using the references to the previous blocks .",
    "once all the missing blocks have been retrieved , b adds the entire batch to his blockchain . on a somewhat stylized level ,",
    "such update in batches translates to the following service discipline : whenever there is a service completion , then _ all earlier arrivals _ that are still in the system complete service and depart as well . that is",
    ", departures occur in batches , which we refer to as fifo - batches .",
    "this departure mechanism leads to crucial differences compared to the conventional infinite - server model where customers depart one by one upon their own service completion .    in the above model , we assume a renewal arrival process and exponentially distributed service times .",
    "our first contribution concerns a number of closed - form characteristics , in particular for the busy period distribution .",
    "remarkably , this distribution turns out to _ not _ depend on the inter - arrival distribution or the arrival rate , contradicting the intuition that a large arrival rates should result in a longer busy period .",
    "this seeming paradox is resolved relying on an equivalent service discipline  lifo - batch departures .",
    "distributionally , the model s evolution is the same under either discipline .",
    "this equivalence also makes it possible to identify the corresponding stationary distribution ( in the generalized sense , since the underlying process is not markov due to renewal arrivals ) .",
    "it is unclear whether this result could be obtained analytically under the original fifo - batch departures discipline .",
    "other closed - form results are obtained under the additional assumption of poisson arrivals ( such that the queue - length process is a continuous - time markov chain ) : by direct methods , we derive moments of the stationary distribution and the queue - size distribution at any given time instant .",
    "the second strand of results that we obtain is of an asymptotic nature . we develop a fluid limit for the queue - length process in presence of service delays . as fluid limits arise under law - of - large - numbers scalings , they are typically deterministic",
    "; this is for instance the case for the conventional infinite - server model . in our model , however , the fluid limit is radically different : rather than being deterministic , in the fluid limit some randomness is retained .",
    "more specifically , the fluid limit corresponds to a growth - collapse process : it grows linearly between randomly occurring downward jumps , where the jump rate is proportional to the current position . at each jump",
    ", the state undergoes a uniform cut - off ( that is , the position drops to a level that is uniformly distributed between 0 and the pre - jump position ) .",
    "growth - collapse processes have been studied in the literature and are used to describe a wide range of phenomena ranging from seismic to neuronal activity ; see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "interestingly , growth - collapse processes similar to the the fluid limit in our paper arise as scaling limits of markovian aimd ( additive - increase / multiplicative - decrease ) congestion control schemes analysed by dumas et al .",
    "@xcite and guillemin et al .",
    "however , the generator approach that quickly yields the fluid limits in @xcite is non - applicable to our non - markovian model . in this regard",
    ", this paper suggests a non - markovian counterpart for the fluid limit analysis in @xcite .",
    "we present the proof of the fluid limit theorem under fifo-/lifo - batch departures , which correspond to the uniform cut - offs in the fluid limit .",
    "however , the proof is sufficiently flexible to allow for more general service disciplines that result in generally distributed multiplicative cut - offs in the fluid limit .    in more detail",
    ", the following techniques are used in the proof of the fluid - limit theorem .",
    "first , we identify an embedded markov chain that converges to the post- and pre - jump fluid limit levels .",
    "this part of the proof builds on the embedded markov chain analysis in @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the weibullian increments between the jumps in the fluid limit ( which yield the jump rate proportional to the state ) is similar to the corresponding derivation in @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the uniform cut - offs in the fluid limit is more involved than the corresponding conclusion in @xcite , where the multiplicative - decrease factor is fixed throughout the pre - limit models and is directly inherited by the fluid limit . in our case ,",
    "the downward jumps of the embedded markov chain only become uniform in the limit , which we additionally prove . in the second part of the proof ,",
    "we establish convergence of the continuous - time queue - length process based on the convergence of the embedded markov chain .",
    "we follow the conventional approach : first we show convergence of finite - dimensional distributions and then verify a compact - containment and oscillation - control conditions , which imply the relative - compactness of the pre - limit processes . as a final note on the proof techniques , we emphasize the following methodological difference with earlier work . in @xcite ,",
    "the embedded markov chain is used to find ( the fluid limit of ) the stationary distribution of the full markov chain .",
    "the fluid limit of the full markov chain itself is obtained via generators . in this paper ,",
    "( the fluid limit of ) the stationary distribution of the queue - length process is known directly .",
    "we use the embedded markov chain to derive the fluid limit of the non - markov queue - length process .",
    "besides the mentioned connection with the aimd and growth - collapse literature , our paper also relates , on the modelling level , to the bitcoin study by gbel et al .",
    "@xcite on whether it could be profitable to abuse the bitcoin protocol by hiding information instead of propagating it .",
    "the model that is the starting point for the analysis in  @xcite and our model are complementary in the following sense .",
    "gbel et al .",
    "@xcite consider bitcoin - like communication between two parties that both generate new information and communicate it to each other , while we consider one - sided communication . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite omits some communication transitions to ensure analytical tractability of the model , whereas those are taken into account in the present paper .",
    "more specifically , @xcite assumes complete synchronization whenever communication takes place . however , unless the latest information has been communicated , the two parties only partially synchronize , i.e. , remain desynchronized ; we succeed to include this aspect in our model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : stationary_analysis ] , we introduce the model , discuss the insensitivity of the busy period distribution with respect to the arrival rate , present formulae for the stationary distribution and its moments ( under poisson arrivals ) . in section  [ sec : transient_analysis ] , we characterize the transient behavior : give a formula for the queue - length distribution at a fixed time ( under poisson arrivals ) and present the fluid limit theorem . in section",

    "the complement of an event @xmath19 is denoted by @xmath20 . finally , the following types of notation are used for vectors : @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "in this section , we introduce the model under study and discuss a number of its properties .",
    "first , we argue that two different service disciplines are equivalent .",
    "this equivalence provides insights into the results that we discuss next : an insensitivity property of the busy period and stationary characteristics of the model .",
    "the model we analyze is a variant of one of the classical queueing models  the @xmath23 queue  where the service discipline is modified .",
    "* @xmath23-queue with fifo - batch departures . *",
    "the following aspects are the same in the conventional @xmath23 model and the variant @xmath23 under study .",
    "there are infinitely many servers that provide service at a unit rate .",
    "an arriving customer immediately starts service at one of the non - occupied servers .",
    "customers arrive according to a renewal process of rate @xmath24 , and their service requirements are exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath25 , mutually independent and also independent from the arrival process .",
    "what is different in the two models is the departure mechanism . in the conventional @xmath23 queue , a customer leaves the system upon service completion , and hence customers depart one by one . in the model",
    "we analyze , departures occur in batches .",
    "we assume additionally that customers line up in the queue in the order of arrival .",
    "( this assumption is not restrictive but convenient when referring to departure events . )",
    "suppose the service of a particular customer has finished .",
    "then it is not this customer only who leaves the system but those _ in front of _ him in the queue leave as well .",
    "we refer to a customer together with those in front of him in the queue as _ a  fifo ( first - in - first - out ) batch _ , and to the modified @xmath23 model described above  as the _ @xmath23 queue with fifo - batch departures_.    * alternative interpretation : @xmath23 queue with lifo - batch departures .",
    "* assume now that , instead of fifo batches , _ lifo ( last - in - first - out ) batches _ are formed upon departures .",
    "that is , if there is a service completion , the freshly served customer leaves together with those _ behind _ him in the queue .",
    "note that the two departure policies are symmetric .",
    "a fifo - batch departure  cuts off \" a front part of the queue , and a lifo - batch departure  the tail of the queue .",
    "but , in both scenarios , the post - departure queue size is a uniform sample of the queue size prior to the departure .",
    "this equivalence , in combination with the memorylessness of the exponential service times , implies that the queue dynamics is distributionally the same under either discipline .    more formally , between two consecutive arrivals , both the @xmath23 queue with fifo - batch departures and that with lifo - batch departures evolve like a continuous - time markov chain on @xmath26 with transition rates @xmath27 and absorption at the zero state .",
    "respectively , overall , the two models evolve like the markov chain   that gets interrupted according to a renewal process that is independent from the chain , and every interruption ( i.e. , arrival ) increases the state of the chain by one . in particular",
    ", this coupling implies that the two queue - length processes viewed as random elements of the skorokhod space @xmath8 have the same distribution .    _",
    "as discussed in the introduction , fifo - batch departures align with the initial motivation for the model that comes from the blockchain update mechanism .",
    "lifo - batch departures , on the other hand , are a more convenient assumption in some of the proofs ( in the rest of the proofs , a particular interpretation does not matter ) . under lifo - batch departures ,",
    "a customer is affected by those in front of him in the queue only but not by those who arrive after him , which turns out to simplify the analysis .",
    "although some of the results , for example the insensitivity of the busy period distribution , are not intuitively clear under fifo - batch departures , all results of the paper are valid for both fifo- and lifo - batch departures by the coupling discussed above . _    _ borst et al .",
    "@xcite , too , employ a probabilistic coupling to show the equivalence of two service disciplines , processor sharing and random order of service , in the @xmath28 queue . in  @xcite , each customer of one queue is coupled with a customer in the other queue . in this paper",
    ", we do not couple the two models directly but through a third model .",
    "note that a straightforward modification of the coupling used here provides an alternative to the coupling used in  @xcite .",

    "note that the (  stationary \" ) distribution of the queue - length process does not depend on the particular interpretation of fifo- or lifo - batch departures .    by @xmath35",
    "we denote the generic service time of a customer ( distributed exponentially with parameter @xmath25 ) .",
    "more generally , @xmath36 stands for a random variable that is distributed exponentially with parameter @xmath37 , @xmath38 .    the generic inter - arrival time is denoted by @xmath39 , its i.i.d",

    "a _ busy period _ is a period of time between an arrival into the empty system and the first instant since this arrival when the system becomes empty again .",
    "intuitively , a larger arrival rate should result in a longer busy period .",
    "remarkably , in the model under study , the busy period distribution does not depend on the inter - arrival distribution ( and in particular , it does not depend on the arrival rate ) .    [ lem : busy_period ] both under fifo- and lifo - batch departures , the busy period of the @xmath23 queue is distributed exponentially with parameter @xmath25 .    under fifo - batch departures ,",
    "the result seems counter - intuitive but it does admit an analytical proof , which we provide here for completeness .",
    "denote by @xmath47 the service time of the customer that initiates the busy period , by @xmath48 @xmath49 the service times of the newly arriving customers , and by @xmath40 their inter - arrival times .",

    "hence , the busy period lasts for @xmath50 where @xmath51 but the memoryless property of the exponential distribution implies that @xmath52 and hence @xmath53 .",
    "however , the coupling of fifo- and lifo - batch departures discussed in section  [ sec : coupling ] allows for a more elegant proof .",
    "it ensures that the busy period distribution is the same under either discipline . under lifo - batch departures , in contrast to the analytical proof above , the lemma follows directly from the way customers interact .",
    "indeed , a  customer leaves as soon as his own service time expires or the service time of someone in front of him in the queue .",
    "hence , the customer who initiates the busy period leaves exactly when his own service time expires .",
    "but if he leaves , the queue empties . that is , the busy period lasts for exactly the service time of the initial customer .      in this paper , by the _",

    "first , note that the queue - length process @xmath54 is regenerative with the initiation instants of busy periods as regeneration points . respectively , a cycle is a period of time between the initiation instants of two successive busy periods .",
    "in particular , if the inter - arrival time distribution is non - lattice , then the cycle distribution is non - lattice , too , and then the limit queue - length distribution exists ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem vi.1.2 ) ) and   necessarily holds .",
    "now we discuss why the limits   exist and satisfy the formula  .",
    "the idea behind   for @xmath62 is that the queue is non - empty when it is in busy periods , which are distributed exponentially with parameter @xmath25 and are parts of i.i.d",

    "denote by @xmath63 the generic cycle length .",
    "then the law of large numbers implies that @xmath64    to derive   for @xmath65 , we assume lifo - batch departures and classify customers into levels : a customer is of level @xmath38 if he arrives into the system with @xmath66 other customers .",
    "the point of this classification is that the queue size is at least @xmath67 during the sojourn times of level @xmath67 customers .",
    "note that the sojourn time ( from arrival until departure ) of a level @xmath67 customer is distributed exponentially with parameter @xmath68 since it is the minimum of his own service time and the service times of the @xmath66 customers in front of him .",
