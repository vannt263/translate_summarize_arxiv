    "eta photo- and electroproduction on the nucleon , @xmath8 , provide an alternative tool to study @xmath9 besides @xmath10 scattering and pion photoproduction .",
    "there are fewer resonances involved since the @xmath11 state couples to nucleon resonances with isospin @xmath12 only .",
    "therefore , this process is cleaner and more selective to distinguish certain resonances than other processes , e.g. , pion photoproduction .",
    "this provides opportunities to access less studied resonances and possibly the `` missing resonances '' .    during the last decade eta photo- and electroproduction",
    "has been studied in very different frameworks .",
    "common in most approaches is the dominance of the @xmath0 resonance , which seems to be the natural mechanism to describe the almost constant angular distributions of the differential cross sections from threshold at @xmath13 up to energies around @xmath14 .",
    "early coupled channel approaches predicted eta photoproduction on the basis of elastic and inelastic pion nucleon scattering and pion photoproduction amplitudes  @xcite , more recent developments included the eta photoproduction data in their fits  @xcite .",
    "field theoretical lagrangian models  @xcite and applications of chiral perturbation theory  @xcite derive covariant eta production amplitudes from born terms , vector meson exchange , and resonance excitations . in these approaches",
    "the spin 3/2 resonances such as @xmath5 are treated in a rarita - schwinger formalism but higher spin resonances have not yet been introduced .",
    "relativistic quark models have been successful in describing the general behavior of the cross sections  @xcite , and in a very recent approach a very good fit of the existing data has been obtained by introducing a third @xmath1 resonance around 1700 mev  @xcite in addition to the well - known resonances @xmath0 and @xmath2 . the role of polarization observables has been studied in an isobar model  @xcite based on early experiments from bonn  @xcite and mainz  @xcite .    apart from the @xmath0 dominated approaches , alternative ways have been discussed within the lee model as well as in chiral meson - baryon lagrangian theory . in these approaches",
    "the @xmath7-wave production is either described by a nonresonant background  @xcite or by a molecule like @xmath15 intermediate state .",
    "as was pointed out by hhler  @xcite , the existence of the @xmath0 can not be unambiguously proven by the standard technique of pion nucleon speed - plots . a pole position of @xmath16 as given by pdg  @xcite is too close to threshold with a width larger than the distance from threshold in order to show a peak in the speed - plot .",
    "the only signature that appears is the sharp spike due to the @xmath17 cusp . on the other hand",
    "the resonance is strongly supported by the quark model and even the large @xmath11 branching ratio of almost 50% can be understood by color hyperfine mixing  @xcite .",
    "the same resonance also makes a significant contribution in pion photo- and electroproduction .",
    "there , however , it usually causes the problem of a photon resonance coupling @xmath18 of only @xmath19 times the value obtained in eta photoproduction analyses  @xcite . in order to shed more light on the underlying nature of the very pronounced @xmath7-wave amplitude , a precise study of the @xmath20 dependence of both transverse and longitudinal couplings",
    "is needed for both pion and eta electroproduction .",
    "in addition the same mechanism also has to describe the eta production off neutrons that has been investigated in coherent and incoherent eta photoproduction experiments on the deuteron . only by introducing a strong background in the @xmath7-wave amplitude both reactions",
    "could be described simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "the situation of higher resonances is somewhat different .",
    "their existence is well established but the decay in the @xmath11 channel is mostly very vague .",
    "branching ratios listed in pdg92 were later removed for being too uncertain . only very recently ,",
    "due to precise photon asymmetry data from graal , a branching ratio of @xmath21 could be determined for the @xmath5 resonance  @xcite .",
    "this result has also been confirmed by other analyses of the same data set . in these analyses",
    "another discrepancy in comparison to pion photoproduction was observed yielding a much smaller @xmath22 ratio for the @xmath5 resonance @xcite .    unlike pion production for which born terms give large background contributions to all partial waves due to the large pion nucleon coupling constant , in @xmath17 production the coupling of the eta meson to the nucleon is very small .",
    "already in the su(3 ) limit the coupling @xmath23 is much smaller than for pions ( @xmath24 ) , but in an analysis of the angular distributions of eta photoproduction an even smaller value of @xmath25 was determined  @xcite .",
    "such a small value was later also explained within a chiral lagrangian approach  @xcite , and in a very recent fit within a chiral constituent quark model a value of only @xmath26 has been obtained  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the only sizeable background contribution remains in the @xmath27-channel vector meson amplitudes , mainly due to @xmath28 exchange .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend an earlier version of an isobar model by knchlein _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and to continue the work on the unitary isobar model maid  @xcite . in the same way as in maid for pions we will describe the eta photo- and electroproduction in terms of nucleon born terms , vector meson exchange contributions and resonance excitations parameterized with breit - wigner shapes directly connected to the conventional resonance parameters listed in the particle data tables : masses , widths , branching ratios and photon couplings . by use of the world data on photo- and electroproduction , all free or uncertain parameters of the model will be fixed by least squares fitting .",

    "we have also looked for a possible  missing \" @xmath1 resonance in the region around 1700  mev .",
    "however , in our isobar model such an additional state is not supported by the fits to the data .    finally , the only data that we can not sufficiently describe are the target polarization data in the threshold region . as already found in the model independent analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , the structure found in the target polarization goes beyond the scope of an isobar model and would require a very large  background \" from another mechanism , not considered in our model , nor in any other model so far .",
    "further measurements of this and other target polarization observables with double polarization would be very useful to track down the underlying mechanism of the threshold @xmath7-wave production if it should not be given by the @xmath0 resonance alone .",
