    "<S> the scheme exploits the fact that postselecting the weak measurement of an ancilla can produce a linear detector response with an anomalously high sensitivity to small changes in an interaction parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity arises from coherent `` super - oscillatory '' interference in the ancilla @xcite , which is controlled by the choice of preparation and postselection of the ancilla . </S>",

    "<S> we show that these improvements scale optimally as the number of entangled ancillas increases ; however , using even a small number of entangled ancillas provides a notable improvement . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that nearly all the quantum fisher information about the estimated parameter can be preserved in the rarely postselected state , which allows the parameter estimation to nearly saturate the quantum cramr - rao bound in the weak value regime .    as a concrete proposal that demonstrates this optimal scaling , we consider using @xmath0 entangled ancilla qubits @xcite to estimate a small controlled phase applied to a meter qubit . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments with optical @xcite , solid - state @xcite and nmr @xcite systems have already verified the weak value effect using one or two qubits . as such , we provide a simple set of similar quantum circuits that can be implemented experimentally in a straightforward way using only three physical qubits .    _ </S>",

    "<S> the ability to improve the postselection efficiency hinges upon the fact that there can be different choices of @xmath7 and @xmath8 that will produce the same weak value @xmath49 . </S>",

    "<S> this improvement in postselection efficiency addresses a practical shortcoming of weak value amplification , and achieves the optimal scaling with @xmath0 that can be expected from quantum metrology . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we have shown that weak value amplification can nearly saturate the quantum cramr - rao bound , despite the low efficiency of postselection . </S>",
    "<S> we have also provided simple quantum circuits for the protocol that are readily implementable by existing quantum computing architectures that possess three qubits .    _ </S>",
