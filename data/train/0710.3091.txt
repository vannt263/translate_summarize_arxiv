    "since the discovery of the @xmath0 at brookhaven  @xcite and slac  @xcite in 1974 , more than one hundred exclusive decay modes of the @xmath0 have been reported . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , direct hadronic , electromagnetic and radiative decays make up roughly 65% , 14% , and 7% of the total @xmath0 decay width , respectively . however , the measured hadronic decay channels sum up to less than 35 % .",
    "the besii data sample of 5.8 @xmath8 @xmath0 events provides a good opportunity to search for missing @xmath9 hadronic decays .    in 2004 , besii reported the observation of an enhancement @xmath10 near the threshold of the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath11 in @xmath12 decays .",
    "the mass , width , and product branching fraction of this enhancement are @xmath13 mev/@xmath14 , @xmath15 mev/@xmath14  @xcite , and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the study of the isospin conjugate channel @xmath17 is therefore important not only in exploring new decay modes of @xmath9 but also in understanding the @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath3 @xmath0 and @xmath4 @xmath1 events at besii also offer a unique opportunity to search for new decay modes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 and test the `` 12% rule '' in hadronic decays . in perturbative",
    "qcd , hadronic decays of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are expected to proceed dominantly via three gluons or a single direct photon with widths proportional to the square of the @xmath18 wave function at the origin , which is well determined from dilepton decays .",
    "thus for any hadronic final state @xmath19 , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay branching fractions should satisfy the so called `` 12% rule ''  @xcite . @xmath20",
    "the leptonic branching fractions are taken from the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite tables .",
    "it is roughly obeyed for a number of exclusive hadronic decay channels except some @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 channels  @xcite@xcite@xcite , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote members of the pseudoscalar , vector and tensor nonets , respectively .    in this paper , the first observation and measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to @xmath2 , as well as a test of the perturbative qcd 12% rule",
    "are presented .",

    "events must have four good charged tracks with zero net charge .",
    "a good charged track is a track that is well fitted to a three - dimensional helix , originates from the interaction region and has a polar angle @xmath44 in the range @xmath45 0.8 . because of the long decay lengths before @xmath46 and @xmath47 decay to @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the interaction region",
