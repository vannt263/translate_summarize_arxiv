    "studies of complex networks have recently attracted much attention in diverse areas of science @xcite .",
    "many real - world complex systems can be usefully described in the language of networks or graphs , as sets of nodes connected by edges @xcite .",
    "although different in nature many networks are found to possess common properties .",
    "many networks are known to have a `` small - world '' property @xcite : despite their large size , the shortest path between any two nodes is very small .",
    "in addition , many real networks are scale - free ( sf ) @xcite , well approximated by a power - law tail in degree distribution , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of links per node .",
    "many networks , such as the www and biological networks have self - similar properties and are fractals @xcite . the box - counting algorithm @xcite allows to calculate their fractal dimensions @xmath4 from the box - counting relation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the minimum number of boxes of size @xmath17 needed to cover the entire network ( appendix b ) .",
    "structural analysis of fractal networks shows that the emergence of sf fractal networks is mainly due to disassortativity or repulsion between hubs @xcite .",
    "that is , nodes of large degree ( hubs ) tend to connect to nodes of small degree , giving life to the paradigm `` the rich get richer but at the expense of the poor . ''",
    "to incorporate this feature , a growth model of sf fractal networks that combines a renormalization growth approach with repulsion between hubs has been introduced @xcite .",
    "it has also been noted @xcite that the traditional measure of assortativity of networks , the pearson coefficient @xmath18 @xcite does not distinguish between fractal and non - fractal network since it is not invariant under renormalization .    here , we study properties of fractal and non - fractal networks , including both models and real networks .",
    "we focus on one important characteristic of networks , the _ betweenness centrality _",
    "( c ) , @xcite , defined as , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of shortest paths between nodes @xmath21 and @xmath14 that pass node @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the total number of shortest paths between nodes @xmath21 and @xmath14 .",
    "the betweenness centrality of a node is proportional to the number of shortest paths that go through it .",
    "since transport is more efficient along shortest paths , nodes of high betweenness centrality @xmath0 are important for transport .",
    "if they are blocked , transport becomes less efficient . on the other hand ,",
    "if the capacitance of high @xmath0 nodes is improved , transport becomes significantly better @xcite .",
    "here we show that fractal networks possess much lower correlation between betweenness centrality and degree of a node compared to non - fractal networks .",
    "we find that in fractal networks even small degree nodes can have very large betweenness centrality while in non - fractal networks large betweenness centrality is mainly attributed to large degree nodes .",
    "we also show that the betweenness centrality distribution in sf fractal networks obeys a power law .",
    "we study the effect of adding random edges to fractal networks .",
    "we find that adding a small number of random edges to fractal networks significantly decreases the betweenness centrality of small degree nodes .",
    "however , adding random edges to non - fractal networks has a significantly smaller effect on the betweenness centrality .",
    "we also analyze the transition from fractal to non - fractal networks by adding random edges and show both analytically and numerically that there exists a crossover length @xmath10 such that for length scales @xmath24 the topology of the network is fractal while for @xmath25 it is non - fractal .",
    "the crossover length scales as @xmath26 , where @xmath12 is the number of random edges per node . we analyze seven sf model networks and four real networks .",
    "the four real networks we analyze are the network of pharmaceutical firms @xcite , an internet network at the as level obtained from the dimes project @xcite , pin network of yeast @xcite and www network of university of western sydney @xcite .",
    "pharmaceutical network is the network of nodes representing firms in the worldwide pharmaceutical industry and the links are collaborative agreements among them .",
    "the internet network represents a sample of the internet structure at the autonomous systems(as ) level .",
    "the protein interaction network ( pin ) of yeast represents proteins as nodes and interactions between them as links between nodes . the www network of university of western sydney represents web pages ( nodes ) targeted by links from the uws.edu.au domain .",
    "basic properties of the considered networks are summarized in table .",
    "i.    the manuscript is organized as follows : in section ii , we study correlation between the betweenness centrality and degree of nodes , and we compare fractal and non - fractal networks . we analyze the betweenness centrality variance @xmath27 of nodes of the same degree @xmath14 and introduce a correlation coefficient @xmath28 that describes the strength of betweenness centrality degree correlation .",
    "we also analyze the betweenness centrality distribution @xmath29 of several model and real networks . in section",
    "iii we study the transition from fractal to non - fractal networks with randomly added edges .",
    "appendix a provides a short summary of the fractal growth model introduced in @xcite .",
    "appendix b discusses the box covering method and its approximations .",
    "it is generally accepted @xcite that in many networks nodes having a larger degree also have a larger betweenness centrality .",
    "indeed , the larger the degree of a node , the larger the chance that many of the shortest paths will pass through this node ; the chance of many shortest paths passing a low degree node is presumably small . here",
    "we show that this is not the case for fractal sf networks . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_centr_vs_degree](a ) small degree nodes in fractal sf networks have a broad range of betweenness centrality values .",
    "the betweenness centrality of many small degree nodes can be comparable to that of the largest hubs of the network . for non - fractal networks , on the other hand , degree and betweenness centrality of nodes",
    "are strongly correlated .    to demonstrate the difference in the relation between degree and betweenness centrality in real networks we compare original networks with their random ( uncorrelated ) counterparts .",
    "we construct the random counterpart network by rewiring the edges of the original network , yet preserving the degrees of the nodes and enforcing its connectivity . as a result",
    "we obtain a random network with the same degree distribution which is _ always _ non - fractal regardless of the original network . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_centr_vs_degree](b),the betweenness centrality - degree correlation of a random network obtained by rewiring edges of the www network is much stronger compared to that of the original network .",
    "ranges of betweenness centrality values for a given degree decrease significantly as we randomly rewire edges of a fractal sf network .",
    "the quantitative description of the betweenness centrality - degree correlation can be given by the analysis of the betweenness centrality variance @xmath27 attributed to nodes of specific degree @xmath14 .",
    "larger values of the variance @xmath27 mean weaker correlations between degree and betweenness centrality of a node since nodes of the same degree have larger variations in betweenness centrality values . as seen in fig .",
    "[ variance profiles ] , in a region of small degree , betweenness centrality variance @xmath27 of fractal networks is significantly bigger than that of their respective randomly rewired counterparts which are not fractals . at the same time betweenness centrality variance of non - fractal networks is comparable or even smaller than that of the corresponding randomly rewired networks .",
    "thus , the betweenness centrality of nodes of fractal networks is significantly less correlated with degree than in non - fractal networks .",
    "this can be understood as a result of the repulsion between hubs found in fractals @xcite : large degree nodes prefer to connect to nodes of small degree and not to each other .",
    "therefore , the shortest path between two nodes must necessarily pass small degree nodes which are found at all scales of a network .",
    "thus , in fractal networks small degree nodes have a broad range of values of betweenness centrality while in non - fractal networks nodes of small degree generally have small betweenness centrality .",
    "betweenness centralities of small degree nodes in fractal networks significantly decrease after random rewiring since the rewired network is no longer fractal . on the other hand , centralities of nodes in non - fractal networks either do not change or increase after rewiring of edges .    as seen in fig.[fig_centr_vs_degree](b ) , the main difference in the betweenness centrality - degree correlation between fractal and non - fractal sf networks reveals itself in the dispersion of betweenness centrality values attributed to nodes of given degree , rather than in the average betweenness centrality values .",
    "so , in order to characterize and quantify the overall betweenness centrality - degree correlation we propose a correlation dispersion coefficient : @xmath30 where @xmath27 and @xmath31 are the betweenness centrality variances of the original and randomly rewired networks respectively and @xmath32 is the degree distribution of both networks .",
    "the dispersion coefficient @xmath28 is the ratio between the mean variance @xmath33 of the original network and @xmath34 , the mean variance of the randomly rewired network .",
    "we note that fractal sf networks have bigger values of the betweenness centrality variance than their randomly rewired counterparts and therefore , have correlation dispersion coefficient @xmath35 . on the other hand @xmath27 of the non - fractal sf networks",
    "is close or smaller than that of their random counterparts @xmath31 which result in values of the correlation dispersion coefficient @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "the calculated values of the correlation dispersion coefficient @xmath28 for the networks we considered in the paper are summarized in table .",
    "i.    the probability density function ( pdf ) of betweenness centrality has been studied for both erds rnyi @xcite and sf @xcite networks .",
    "it was found that for sf networks the betweenness centrality distribution satisfies a power law @xmath38 with typical values of @xmath39 between 1 and 2 @xcite .",
    "our studies of the betweenness centrality distribution support these earlier results ( fig .  [ fig_centr_distr ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath39 increases with dimension @xmath4 of analyzed fractal networks . in the case of non - fractal networks , where @xmath40 , estimated values of @xmath39 seem to be close to @xmath41 .",
    "an analytic expression for @xmath39 can be derived for sf fractal tree networks by using arguments similar to those used in @xcite to find @xmath39 for the minimum spanning tree ( mst ) .",
    "consider a fractal tree network of dimension @xmath4 .",
    "a small region of the network consisting of @xmath42 nodes will have a typical diameter @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "nodes in this region will be connected to the rest of the network via @xmath44 nodes .",
    "thus , the betweenness centrality of those nodes is at least @xmath42 . since the number of regions of size @xmath42 is @xmath45 , the total number of nodes with betweenness centrality @xmath46 in the network is    @xmath47    thus , the number of links with betweenness centrality @xmath42 is @xmath48 using eq .",
    "( [ centr_distr ] ) we immediately obtain @xmath49 thus , eq .  ( [ centr_delta ] ) shows that @xmath39 increases with @xmath4 in agreement with fig .",
    "[ fig_centr_distr ] . for non - fractal networks @xmath50 and @xmath2 .",
    "so non - fractal networks consist of relatively small number of central nodes and a large number of leaves connected to them . on the other hand in fractal networks , especially in those of small dimensionality , due to the repulsion between hubs ,",
    "betweenness centrality is distributed among all nodes of a network .",
    "analysis of the box covering method as a fractal test for some fractal and non - fractal networks studied here is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_nw_dims ] .",
    "we now study the behavior of fractal and non - fractal networks upon adding random edges .",
    "we analyze the crossover from fractal to non - fractal structure when random edges are added . to this end",
    ", we study the minimal number of boxes @xmath16 of size @xmath17 needed to cover the network as a function of @xmath17 as we add random edges to the network . fig .",
    "[ fig_scaling](a ) and  [ fig_scaling](b ) show that the dimension @xmath4 of the networks does not change .",
    "however , the network remains fractal with a power law regime @xmath51 only at length scales @xmath52 below @xmath10 , a characteristic length which depends on @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath53 , the network with added random edges behaves as non - fractal with exponential decay @xmath54 .",
    "the crossover length @xmath10 separating the fractal and non - fractal regions decreases as we add more edges [ see figs .",
    "[ fig_scaling](a ) and [ fig_scaling](b ) ] .",
    "we employ a scaling approach to deduce the functional dependence of the crossover length on the density of added shortcuts @xmath12 .",
    "we propose for @xmath16 the scaling ansatz @xmath55 where @xmath56 with appropriate rescaling we can collapse all the values of @xmath57 onto a single curve [ see figs .",
    "[ fig_scaling](c ) and [ fig_scaling](d ) ] .",
    "the crossover length @xmath58 exhibits a clear power law dependence on the density of random shortcuts [ fig .",
    "[ fig_scaling](e ) ] , @xmath59    we next argue that asymptotically for large @xmath9 , @xmath60 when a fractal network with @xmath9 nodes and @xmath61 edges has additional @xmath62 random edges , the probability of a given node @xmath22 to have a random link is @xmath63 .",
    "the mass of the cluster within a size @xmath52 in a fractal network is @xmath64 .",
    "the probability of @xmath65 possessing a random edge is @xmath66 .",
    "thus , at distances @xmath52 for which @xmath67 we are in the _ fractal _ regime . on the other hand , large distances @xmath52 for which @xmath68 correspond to the _ non - fractal _ regime .",
    "thus , the crossover length @xmath10 corresponds to @xmath69 , which implies @xmath70 or @xmath71 , where @xmath72 .",
    "note that the values measured for the two fractal networks , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_scaling](e ) , @xmath73  @xmath74 and @xmath75  @xmath76 , are slightly smaller then the expected asymptotic values , which we attribute as likely to be due to finite size effects .",
    "we have shown that node betweenness centrality and node degree are significantly less correlated in fractal sf networks compared to non - fractal sf networks due to the effect of repulsion between the hubs .",
    "betweenness centrality distribution in sf networks obeys a power law @xmath77 .",
    "we derived an analytic expression for the betweenness centrality distribution exponent @xmath78 for sf fractal trees .",

    "a growth model of fractal sf networks was first introduced by song et al . @xcite . in the core of the growth model lies the network renormalization technique @xcite : a network is covered with @xmath16 boxes of size @xmath17 .",
    "subsequently , each of the boxes is replaced by a node to construct the renormalized network .",
    "the process is repeated until the network is reduced to a single node .",
