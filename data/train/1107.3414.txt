    "we introduced the concept of @xmath0-schemes in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate further properties of @xmath0-schemes , mainly focusing on zariski - riemann spaces .",
    "first , we will show that there is a normalization of @xmath0-schemes , just as for ordinary schemes .",
    "this is important , since we are aiming for an analog of zariski s main theorem .",
    "one of the advantage of introducing @xmath0-schemes is that we can simplify the proof of nagata embedding theorem ; it can be proven intuitively , as in the original paper of nagata @xcite .",
    "note that the essential part is already proven in corollary 4.4.6 of @xcite .",
    "compare with the proof of conrad @xcite , which only uses ordinary schemes , but is long ( approximately 50 pages ) .",
    "also , we introduce the notion of approximable @xmath0-schemes : an @xmath0-scheme is approximable if it is a ( filtered ) projective limit of ordinary schemes .",
    "this notion is convenient , since locally free sheaves on approximable schemes always come from a pull back of a localy free sheaves on ordinary schemes . at the same time , we see that the zariski - riemann space defined in @xcite is identified with the conventional one , namely the limit space of @xmath1-admissible blow ups along the exceptional locus @xmath2 where @xmath1 is an open subscheme of a scheme @xmath3 .",
    "this shows that the conventional zariski - riemann space has the desirable universal property in the category of @xmath0-schemes , not only with schemes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 1",
    ", we quickly review the definitions and properties of @xmath0-schemes , which plays the central role in this paper . in section 2",
    ", we construct the normalization functor of @xmath0-schemes . in section 3 , we give a notion of approximable @xmath0-schemes .",
    "this actually determines the complete hull of the category @xmath4 of ordinary schemes in the category @xmath5 of @xmath0-schemes , namely the smallest complete full subcategory of @xmath5 containing @xmath4 . in section 4",
    ", we will give a proof of the original version of nagata embedding , which says that any separated scheme of finite type can be embedded as an open subscheme of a proper scheme .",
    "* notation and conventions . * in this paper , the algebraic type @xmath0 is always that of rings when we talk of @xmath0-schemes .",
    "when we say ordinary schemes , we treat only coherent schemes and quasi - compact morphisms between them ; to emphasize this assumption and to distinguish ordinary coherent schemes from @xmath0-schemes , we will say @xmath6-schemes instead of coherent schemes .    for an @xmath0-scheme @xmath3 , the description @xmath7 stands for the underlying topological space , which is coherent .",
