    "quantum entanglement has attracted intensive attention due to its intriguing properties and potential applications in quantum information processing @xcite , @xcite ( chapter 8) .",
    "some geometrically motivated entanglement measures have been providing us new insights on quantum entanglement , e.g. entanglement of formation @xcite , relative entropy of entanglement ( ree ) @xcite , geometric measure of entanglement ( gm ) @xcite , global robustness ( gr ) @xcite , and squashed entanglement @xcite . besides providing a simple geometric picture ,",
    "they are closely related to some operationally motivated entanglement measures , e.g. entanglement of distillation @xcite and entanglement cost @xcite .",
    "their additivity property for the bipartite case has been studied by many researchers as a central issue in quantum information theory , because this property is closely related to operational meanings @xcite . however , concerning the multipartite setting , only the additivity of squashed entanglement has been proved @xcite , while the additivity problem on other measures has largely remained open .    in this paper , we focus on the additivity property of three main entanglement measures in the multipartite case , i.e. ree , gm , and logarithmic global robustness ( lgr ) . these entanglement measures and their additivity property are closely related to operational concepts in the multipartite case as mentioned below .",
    "our results may improve the understanding on multipartite entanglement and stimulate more research work on the three entanglement measures as well as others , such as the tangle @xcite and generalized concurrence @xcite .",
    "ree is a lower bound for entanglement of formation and an upper bound for entanglement of distillation in the bipartite case .",
    "it has a clear statistical meaning as the minimal error rate of mistaking an entangled state for a closest separable state @xcite .",
    "it has also been employed by linden _",
    "et al _ @xcite to study the conditions for reversible state transformation , and by acn _",
    "et al _ @xcite to study the structure of reversible entanglement generating sets  @xcite in the tripartite scenario .",
    "in addition , brando and plenio @xcite have shown that the asymptotic ree equals an asymptotic smooth modification of lgr and a modified version of entanglement of distillation and entanglement cost , which means that the asymptotic ree quantifies the entanglement resources under asymptotic non - entangling operations . in condensed matter physics ,",
    "ree is also useful for characterizing multipartite thermal correlations @xcite and macroscopic entanglement , such as that in high - temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "gm is closely related to the construction of optimal entanglement witnesses @xcite , and discrimination of quantum states under locc @xcite .",
    "gm of tripartite pure states is closely related to the maximum output purity of the quantum channels corresponding to these states @xcite .",
    "recently , gm has been utilized to determine the universality of resource states for one - way quantum computation @xcite .",
    "it has also been applied to show that most entangled states are too entangled to be useful as computational resources @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the connection between gm defined via the convex roof and a distance like measure has also been pointed out @xcite . in condensed matter physics , gm is useful for studying quantum many - body systems , such as characterizing ground state properties and detecting phase transitions @xcite .",
    "gr is closely related to state discrimination under locc @xcite and entanglement quantification with witness operators @xcite .",
    "it is best suited to study the survival of entanglement in thermal states , and to determine the noise thresholds in the generation of resource states for measurement - based quantum computation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the additivity property of the three measures ree , gm and lgr greatly affect the utility of multipartite states .",
    "for example , in state discrimination under locc @xcite , the additivity property of these measures may affect the advantage offered by joint measurements on multiple copies of input states over separate measurements .",
    "the additivity property of gm of generic multipartite states is closely related to their universality as resource states for one - way quantum computation , as we shall see in .",
    "the additivity property of the three measures ree , gm and lgr is also closely related to the calculation of their asymptotic or regularized entanglement measures , which are the asymptotic limits of the regularized quantities with the @xmath0-copy state .",
    "these asymptotic measures will be referred to as asymptotic gm , ree and lgr , and are abbreviated to agm , aree and algr respectively .",
    "they are useful in the study of classical capacity of quantum multi - terminal channels @xcite .",
    "the aree can be used as an invariant when we build the minimal reversible entanglement generating set ( mregs ) under asymptotic locc .",
    "the mregs is a finite set of pure entangled states from which all pure entangled states can be produced reversibly in the asymptotic sense , which is an essential open problem in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "the aree also determines the rate of state transformation under asymptotic non - entangling operations @xcite . in the bipartite case",
    ", the aree provides a lower bound for entanglement cost and an upper bound for entanglement of distillation .",
    "so it is essential to compute the regularized entanglement measures .",
    "however , the problem is generally very difficult .",
    "one main approach for computing these asymptotic measures is to prove their additivity , which is another focus of the present paper . in this case , the asymptotic measures equal to the respective one - shot measures .",
    "our main approach is the following . under some group theoretical conditions , hayashi _ et al _ @xcite showed a relation among ree , lgr and gm . due to this relation",
    ", we can treat the additivity problem of ree and lgr from that of gm in this special case .",
    "hence we can concentrate on the additivity problem of gm .",
    "first , we derive a novel and general additivity theorem for gm of multipartite states with real and non - negative entries in the computational basis . applying this theorem",
    ", we show the additivity of gm of many multipartite states of either practical or theoretical interests , such as ( 1 ) two - qubit bell diagonal states ; ( 2 ) maximally correlated generalized bell diagonal states , which is closely related to local copying @xcite ; ( 3 ) isotropic states , which is closely related to depolarization channel @xcite ; ( 4 ) generalized dicke states @xcite , which is useful for quantum communication and quantum networking , and can already be realized using current technologies @xcite ; ( 5 ) the smolin state @xcite , which is useful for remote information concentration @xcite , super activation @xcite and quantum secret sharing @xcite etc ; and ( 6 ) dr s multipartite entangled states , which include bound entangled states that can violate the bell inequality @xcite . by means of the relation among the three measures",
    "gm , ree and lgr , we also show the additivity of ree of these examples , and the additivity of lgr of the generalized dicke states and the smolin state . as a direct application",
    ", we obtain agm and aree of the above - mentioned examples , and algr of the generalized dicke states and the smolin state .",
    "our approach is also able to provide a lower bound for aree and algr for generic multipartite states with non - negative entries in the computational basis , such as isotropic states @xcite , mixtures of generalized dicke states . in the bipartite scenario , our lower bound for aree is also a lower bound for entanglement cost . for non - negative tripartite pure states ,",
    "the additivity of gm implies the multiplicativity of the maximum output purity of the quantum channels related to these states according to the werner - holevo recipe @xcite .",
    "second , we show the non - additivity of gm of antisymmetric states shared over three or more parties and many bipartite antisymmetric states . we also quantify how additivity of gm is violated in the case of antisymmetric projector states , which include antisymmetric basis states and antisymmetric werner states as special examples , and treat the same problem for ree and lgr .",
    "for the antisymmetric projector states , while the three one - shot entanglement measures are generally non - additive , we obtain a relation among aree , agm and algr .",
    "generalized antisymmetric states @xcite are also treated as further counterexamples to the additivity of gm .",
    "third , we show , with a statistical approach , that almost all multipartite pure states are nearly maximally entangled with respect to gm and ree",
    ". however their gm is not strong additive ; what s more surprising , for generic pure states with real entries in the computational basis , gm of one copy and two copies , respectively , are almost equal .",
    "our discovery has a great implication for the universality of resource states for one - way quantum computation , and for asymptotic state transformation . as a twist to the assertion of gross _",
    "et al _ @xcite that most quantum states are too entangled to be useful as computational resources ,",
    "we show that more states may be suitable for universal quantum computation , if measurements can be performed on two copies of the resource states .",
    "in addition , we show that almost all multipartite pure states can not be prepared reversibly with multipartite ghz states ( with various numbers of parties ) under locc even in the asymptotic sense , unless ree is non - additive for generic multipartite pure states .    for the convenience of the readers , we summarize the main results on gm , ree and lgr of the states studied in this paper in and .",

    "we then discuss the implications of these results for the universality of resource states in one - way quantum computation and for asymptotic state transformation .",
    "we conclude with a summary and some open problems .",
    "in this section , we recall the definitions and basic properties of the three main multipartite entanglement measures , that is , the _ relative entropy of entanglement _ , the _ geometric measure of entanglement _ and the _ global robustness of entanglement _ , and introduce the additivity problem on these entanglement measures .",
    "we also present a few known results concerning the relations among these measures , which will play an important role later .",
    "the impact of permutation symmetry on gm and the connection between gm of tripartite pure states and the maximum output purity of quantum channels are also discussed briefly .",
    "consider an @xmath27-partite state @xmath28 shared over the parties @xmath29 with joint hilbert space @xmath30 .",
    "ree measures the minimum distance in terms of relative entropy between the given state @xmath28 and the set of separable states , and is defined as @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the quantum relative entropy , and the logarithm has base 2 throughout this paper .",

    "any state @xmath39 minimizing is a _ closest separable state _ of @xmath40 . as",
    "its definition involves the minimization over all separable states , ree is known only for a few examples , such as bipartite pure states @xcite , bell diagonal states @xcite , some two - qubit states @xcite , werner states @xcite , maximally correlated states , isotropic states @xcite , generalized dicke states @xcite , antisymmetric basis states @xcite , some graph states @xcite , the smolin state , and dr s multipartite entangled states @xcite . a numeric method for computing ree of bipartite states has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "ree with respect to the set of states with positive partial transpose ( ppt ) @xmath41 , which is obtained by replacing the set of separable states in with the set of ppt states , has also received much attention @xcite . however , in this paper , we shall follow the definition in .",

    "it should be emphasized that , for mixed states , the gm defined in is not an entanglement measure proper , and there are alternative definitions of gm through the convex roof construction @xcite .",
    "however , gm of @xmath40 defined in is closely related to gm of the purification of @xmath40 @xcite , and also to ree and lgr of @xmath40 , as we shall see later",
    ". meanwhile , this definition is useful in the construction of optimal entanglement witnesses @xcite , and in the study of state discrimination under locc @xcite . thus we shall follow the definition in in this paper .",
    "gm is known only for a few examples too , such as bipartite pure states , ghz type states , generalized dicke states @xcite , antisymmetric basis states @xcite , pure symmetric three - qubit states @xcite , some other pure three - qubit states @xcite , and some graph states @xcite .",
    "several numerical methods for computing gm of multipartite states have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "different from the above two entanglement measures , gr @xcite measures how sensitive an entangled state is to the mixture of noise , and is defined as follows , @xmath43 the logarithmic global robustness of entanglement ( lgr ) is defined as @xmath44 lgr is known for even fewer examples , such as bipartite pure states @xcite , generalized dicke states , antisymmetric basis states @xcite , some graph states @xcite .",
    "a numerical method for computing lgr has been proposed in @xcite .      in quantum information processing ,",
    "it is generally more efficient to process a family of quantum states together rather than process each one individually . in this case",
    ", entanglement measures can still serve as invariants under reversible locc transformation , provided that we consider the family of states as a whole .",
    "a fundamental problem in entanglement theory is whether the entanglement of the tensor product of states is the sum of that of each individual .",
    "first we need to make it clear what the entanglement of the tensor product of states means .",
    "take two states as an example , let @xmath40 be an @xmath27-partite sate shared over the parties @xmath45 , and @xmath39 be another @xmath27-partite state shared over the parties @xmath46 , where we have added superscripts to the names of the parties to distinguish the two states .",
    "now there are @xmath47 parties involved in the tensor product state @xmath48 , however , in most scenarios that we are concerned , the pair of parties @xmath49 for each @xmath50 are in the same lab , and can be taken as a single party @xmath51 . in this sense ,",
    "@xmath48 can be seen as an @xmath27-partite state shared over the parties @xmath52 .",
    "the definition of any entanglement measure , such as gm , ree and lgr of the tensor product state @xmath53 follows this convention throughout this paper ; similarly for the tensor product of more than two states , except when stated otherwise .",
    "a particularly important case is the entanglement of the tensor product of multiple copies of the same state . in the limit of large number of copies",
    ", we obtain the regularized or asymptotic entanglement measure , which reads @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the entanglement measure under consideration .",
    "when @xmath55 is taken as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , the resulting regularized measures are referred to as asymptotic ree ( aree ) @xmath58 , asymptotic gm ( agm ) @xmath59 , and asymptotic lgr ( algr ) @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the entanglement @xmath55 of an @xmath27-partite state @xmath40 is called _ additive _ if @xmath61 , and _ strong additive _ if the equality @xmath62 holds for any @xmath27-partite state @xmath39 .",
    "obviously , strong additivity implies additivity .",
    "an entanglement measure itself is called ( strong ) additive if it is ( strong ) additive for any state .",
    "similarly , the entanglement of the two states @xmath63 is called additive if the equality @xmath64 holds .",
    "historically , both gm and ree had been conjectured to be additive , until counterexamples were found .",
    "the first counterexample to the additivity of ree is the antisymmetric werner state found by vollbrecht and werner @xcite .",
    "the first counterexample to the additivity of gm is the tripartite antisymmetric basis state found by werner and holevo @xcite .",
    "coincidentally , the two counterexamples are both antisymmetric states , and the tripartite antisymmetric basis state is exactly a purification of the two - qutrit antisymmetric werner state .",
    "we shall reveal the reason behind this coincidence in .    for bipartite pure states ,",
    "ree is equal to the von neumann entropy of each reduced density matrix @xcite ; gm is equal to the logarithm of the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of each reduced density matrix @xcite ; and lgr is equal to one half the logarithm of the trace of the positive square root of each reduced density matrix @xcite ; thus ree , gm and lgr are all additive .",
    "gm and ree are also additive for any multipartite pure states with generalized schmidt decomposition , such as the ghz state .",
    "more generally , ree ( gm , lgr ) of a multipartite pure state is additive if it is equal to the same measure under some bipartite cut . for example",
    ", some graph states have additive ree , gm and lgr for this reason @xcite . in general",
    ", it is very difficult to prove the additivity or non - additivity of gm , ree and lgr of a given state , or to compute agm , aree and algr .",
    "the additivity of ree is known to hold for a few other examples , such as maximally correlated states , isotropic states @xcite , two - qubit werner states @xcite , and some other two - qubit states @xcite .",
    "little is known about the additivity property of gm and lgr .",
    "there is a simple inequality among the three measures ree , gm and lgr @xcite , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the von neumann entropy . so the inequality @xmath67 holds when @xmath40 is a pure state .",
    "the same is true if the three measures are replaced by their respective regularized measures .",
    "this inequality and its equality condition are crucial in translating our results on gm to that on ree and lgr in the later sections .",
    "a sufficient condition for the equality is given as lemma 9 in appendix c of @xcite .",
    "for convenience , we reproduce it in the following proposition ,    [ proh ] assume that a projector state @xmath68 satisfies the following .",
    "there exist a compact group @xmath69 , its unitary representation @xmath70 , and a product state @xmath71 such that ( 1 ) @xmath72 is a local unitary for all @xmath73 .",

    "for example , generalized dicke states , antisymmetric basis states @xcite , and some graph states @xcite satisfy the conditions ( 1)-(4 ) , so they satisfy . in this case , if gm is additive , then both lgr and ree are additive , which follows from proposition  [ proh2 ] below .",

    "this satisfies the conditions ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) of proposition  [ proh ] concerning the projector state @xmath95 , which implies .",
    "next , we present two known results concerning the relation between a given entanglement measure of a pure multipartite state and that of its reduced states after tracing out one party .",

    "permutation symmetry plays an important role in the study of multipartite entanglement .",
    "a multipartite state is called ( permutation ) _ symmetric _ ( _ antisymmetric _ ) if its support is contained in the symmetric ( antisymmetric ) subspace , and _",

    "one of the key ingredient in their proof is the observation that almost all pure multiqubit states are nearly maximally entangled with respect to gm .",
    "however , their arguments would break down , if measurements are allowed on the tensor product of the resource states , since @xmath590 is just moderate entangled ( gm is nearly one half of the maximal possible value ) for a generic pure multiqudit states @xmath40 , according to theorem  [ thm : gmnonadd ] . in particular , two copies of @xmath40",
    "is moderate entangled if @xmath40 is a real state .",
    "hence , it is conceivable that we may realize universal quantum computation on certain family of multiqudit states if they come in pairs , even if this is impossible on a single copy .",

    "according to the result of linden _ et al _ @xcite , reversible transformation between two pure states under asymptotic locc would mean that the ratio of the bipartite aree @xmath591 to the @xmath27-partite aree @xmath228 is conserved , for @xmath592 , where @xmath593 denotes all the parties except @xmath51 .",

    "the same is true for @xmath8 with @xmath102 , since @xmath602 @xcite ( see also in ) .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the additivity property of three main multipartite entanglement measures , namely gm , ree and lgr .",
    "firstly , we proved the strong additivity of gm of non - negative states , thus simplifying the computation of gm and agm of a large family of states of either experimental or theoretical interest .",
    "thanks to the connection among the three measures , gm of non - negative states provides a lower bound for aree and algr , and a new approach for proving the additivity of ree and lgr for states with certain group symmetry . in particular , we proved the strong additivity of gm and the additivity of ree of bell diagonal states , maximally correlated generalized bell diagonal states , generalized dicke states and their reduced states after tracing out one party , the smolin state and dr s multipartite entangled states etc .",
    "the additivity of lgr of generalized dicke states and the smolin state was also shown .",
    "these results can be applied to studying state discrimination under locc @xcite , the classical capacity of quantum multi - terminal channels .",
    "the result on aree is also useful in studying state transformation either under asymptotic locc or under asymptotic non - entangling operations . for non - negative bipartite states ,",
    "the result on aree also leads to a new lower bound for entanglement of formation and entanglement cost .",
    "the result on gm and agm may find applications in the study of quantum channels due to the connection between pure tripartite states and quantum channels @xcite .",
    "secondly , we established a simple connection between the permutation symmetry and the additivity property of multipartite entanglement measures .",
    "in particular , we showed that gm is non - additive for antisymmetric states shared over three or more parties .",
    "also , we gave a unified explanation of the non - additivity of the three measures gm , ree and lgr of the antisymmetric projector states , and derive analytical formulae of the three measures for one copy and tow copies of such states .",
    "our results on antisymmetric states are expected to be useful in the study of fermion systems , which are described by antisymmetric states due to the super - selection rule .",
    "thirdly , we showed that almost all multipartite pure states are maximally entangled with respect to gm and ree .",
    "however , their gm is not strong additive ; moreover , for generic pure states with real entries in the computational basis , gm of one copy and two copies , respectively , are almost equal . based on these observations",
    ", we showed that more states may be suitable for universal quantum computation , if measurements can be performed on two copies of the resource states .",
    "we also showed that , for almost all multipartite pure states , the additivity of their ree implies the irreversibility in generating them from ghz type states under locc , even in the asymptotic sense .",
