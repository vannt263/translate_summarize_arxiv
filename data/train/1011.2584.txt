    "the calculation of the volume of an arbitrary tetrahedron in a 3-space of non - zero constant curvature is rather hard , and the first result is given by @xcite in 1999 for hyperbolic tetrahedra .",
    "the papers @xcite and @xcite gave another formulas for hyperbolic tetrahedra , which are implicitly based on the quantum @xmath1-symbol .",
    "moreover , it was stated in @xcite that an adequate analytic continuation of the obtained formula also applicable for a spherical tetrahedron .",
    "but , the formula is given by multi - valued functions , and it is not described which stratum we should select for actual computation . on the other hand , volumes of spherical tetrahedra of special shapes",
    "are given by many people from old times , and the most recent work is @xcite , which gives a formula for a spherical tetrahedron having a small symmetry .    in the present paper , volume formulas for a spherical tetrahedron @xmath2 of general shape",
    "are given in theorems 1.1 and 1.2 .",
    "the formula in theorem 1.1 is given in terms of dihedral angles , and the formula in theorem 1.2 is given in terms of edge lengths .",
    "these formulas are obtained by improving those in @xcite , @xcite , and , by using the schlfli differential equality , it is shown that the new formulas actually give the volume of @xmath2 modulo @xmath3 .",
    "please note that @xmath4 is the volume of @xmath5 with radius 1 , which is the universal cover of any 3-dimensional spherical space of constant curvature @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath2 can be included in a 3-dimensional hemisphere , the volume of @xmath2 is less than @xmath6 and so we can compute the volume of @xmath2 actually from the formulas in theorems 1.1 and 1.2 .",
