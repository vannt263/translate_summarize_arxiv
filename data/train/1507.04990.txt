    "financial time series exhibit various non - trivial properties .",
    "the distribution of returns deviates from a normal distribution and shows heavy tails  @xcite .",
    "this behavior was first observed by  @xcite . in stochastic volatility models",
    "the normal distribution is combined with a distribution for the variances .",
    "the resulting return distribution shows non - normality , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , simply drawing volatilities from a distribution does not account for the empirically observed volatility clustering , _ i.e. _ , temporal inhomogeneity . to achieve this",
    "the description by stochastic processes is essential . in his groundbreaking work",
    "engle made great strides towards this goal by introducing the arch process , see  @xcite .",
    "the autocorrelation of the return time series is zero  @xcite .",
    "however , the autocorrelation of the time series for absolute or squared returns is non - zero and slowly decays to zero for larger lags  @xcite .",
    "this effect can be traced back to volatility clustering  @xcite . in",
    "high volatility phases the probability that a large ( absolute ) return is followed by another large return is higher than normal .",
    "the same holds true for phases of small volatility , where small returns are followed by small returns with higher probability .",
    "closely related is the so called `` leverage effect '' .",
    "it is empirically known that volatilities and returns show a negative correlation .",
    "this was first observed by  @xcite and attributed to the fact that stocks with falling prices are riskier and therefore have a higher volatility .",
    "the reduced market capitalization relative to the debt of the company makes it more leveraged , hence the name .",
    "this explanation is often challenged in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the studies of these effects typically focuses on the autocorrelation of return time series or cross correlations between returns and historical or implied volatilities .",
    "a common tool to analyze temporal dependencies in time series is the @xmath0-periodogram , which is intrinsically connected to mean values and covariances and has several optimality properties for the analysis of gaussian series .",
    "on the other hand it is well known that this periodogram has difficulties to detect nonlinear dynamics such as changes in the conditional shape ( skewness , kurtosis ) or heavy tails , and several modifications have been proposed to address these problems .",
    "laplace periodograms have been investigated as an alternative to the ordinary periodogram by  @xcite for analyzing heart rate variability and sun spot data , in the frequency domain .",
    "these peridograms are based on quantile regression methodology , see  @xcite and extensions , which are independent with respect to monotone transformation of the data have been developed by  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors propose a different periodogram , which is defined as the discrete fourier transform of quantile - based correlations , see  @xcite and develop a corresponding statistical theory .    here , we want to show that even the direct use of quantile - based correlations provides a very powerful tool to investigate nonlinear dynamics of financial series in the time domain . for this purpose",
    "we conduct an empirical study on intraday data from stocks in the standard & poor s 500-index ( s&p500 ) during the years 2007 and 2008 .",
    "in addition , we show that quantile - based correlation is able to uncover subtle differences between stochastic processes and empirical data . as an example , we study the return time series from garch  @xcite , egarch  @xcite and gjr - garch  @xcite processes .",
    "given a time series @xmath1 of length @xmath2 we calculate the quantile - based correlation in the following way .",
    "let @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] be probability levels .",
    "then , let @xmath5 be the value at the @xmath6-quantile for the time series @xmath7 .",
    "we first map the time series @xmath7 to a filtered time series @xmath8 according to a filter rule @xmath9 for example , if the time series is @xmath10 we have @xmath11 for the 0.5-quantile and the filtered time series is @xmath12 analogously , we construct a second filtered time series @xmath13 based on a second @xmath14-quantile .",
    "we then calculate the lagged cross - correlation of the filtered time series for each lag @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the mean value of the filtered time series @xmath8 .",
    "the standard deviation of the filtered time series is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "the basic idea of quantile - based filtered binary time series was first put forward by  @xcite .",
    "the case of equal probability levels in the time domain is discussed in  @xcite and @xcite who proposed a discrete fourier transform of the correlations in ( [ eq : qcf2 ] ) with fixed @xmath19 in order to develop robust spectral analysis . for",
    "an alternative estimate and the case @xmath20 see  @xcite .",
    "+ we calculate 95% confidence intervals for the quantile correlation functions by taking the standard deviation of the fluctuations of the @xmath21 quantiles around zero and multiply them with the standard score of 1.96 corresponding to a @xmath22 confidence level .",
    "this mitigates problems which would be introduced using the standard approach for confidence intervals , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath23 divided by the square root of the sample size , which assumes that the elements of the time series are _ i.i.d_. this assumption is not valid for the financial data we consider in the following .    from the setup of the quantile correlation function",
    "we immediately see that for equal probabilities @xmath24 eq .  ( [ eq : qcf2 ] ) yields the autocorrelation of the filtered time series . in this case",
    "the quantile correlation function is symmetric , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath25 .",
    "if the probabilities differ , @xmath26 , the quantile correlation function is not necessarily symmetric .",
    "we now clarify the meaning of possible combinations for @xmath6 and @xmath14 .",
    "we denote the combination of probabilities with @xmath27 .",
    "for example , if we choose the @xmath28 quantiles , the filtered time series will each contain 5% ones , which correspond to the smallest 5% of values in the time series @xmath7 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcf ] ) . in this case , we correlate the smallest values of the time series in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcf2 ] ) . on the other hand , consider the @xmath29 quantiles . here , we correlate the 95% of the smallest values of the time series @xmath7 . however , in the case of financial time series it is more interesting to know how the largest 5% of values are correlated . the @xmath29",
    "quantiles also indicate this .",
    "we notice that if we change the less - than or equal to sign in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcf ] ) to a greater - than sign for both filtered time series @xmath8 and @xmath13 we get the complement of the filtered time series , _",
    "i.e. _ , ones become zeroes and zeroes become ones . readers with a background in computer science",
    "will notice that this is equivalent to a binary not operation on each filtered time series . as long as this operation is performed on both filtered time series the sign of the quantile correlation function will not change , compare eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcf2 ] ) .",
    "this leads us to the interesting case where we want to know how the smallest 5% values are correlated to the largest 5% .",
    "we choose the @xmath30 quantiles and effectively correlate the smallest 5% of the values with the smallest 95% . to answer the question",
    ", we have to change the lesser - than or equal to sign only for the second filtered time series @xmath31 .",
    "this results in a change of sign for the quantile correlation function .",
    "suppose we find a negative correlation for the @xmath30 quantiles .",
    "this means that the smallest 5% and 95% of the time series are negatively correlated . at the same time it implies that the smallest 5% and the largest 5% of the time series are positively correlated . to keep the notation simple",
    ", we will always calculate the filtered time series according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcf ] ) and mention how to interpret the quantile correlation function in the given context .",
    "we conduct an empirical study using intraday data from the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) from 2007 and 2008 .",
    "we restrain ourselves to stocks from the s&p 500 index , which consists mostly of the largest corporations in the usa .",
    "these stocks are traded frequently , giving us enough trades per day for meaningful statistics .",
    "the time series for the trades are accurate to the second .",
    "we discard the first and last ten minutes of each trading day to minimize effects due to the closing and opening auction .",
    "this leads to a time series of @xmath32 seconds per day , ensuring that the studied time series are solely the result of the continuous trading , which uses the double auction order book mechanism . if no trade takes place during a given second we use the previous price for this second .",
    "the nyse data set contains a huge amount of data which needs some preparation before using it .",
    "we only take into account regular orders and require that at least in @xmath33 different seconds trades have taken place on a day for a given stock .",
    "otherwise we do not use the trades of this day .",
    "the quantile - based correlation is always calculated on these intraday time series of @xmath32 seconds .",
    "this is necessary due to the interday gap between the closing price and the opening price of the next trading day .",
    "we average the quantile - based correlation functions over all available trading days of roughly @xmath34 days for each year . from the price series @xmath35 of each stock @xmath36",
    ", we calculate the return time series @xmath37 for one - minute returns @xmath38s . for the following study we only take the return time series into account .",
    "we notice that the quantile correlation function is invariant under monotone transforms .",
    "therefore the binary time series are unaffected by the choice of returns , _",
    "i.e. _ , non - logarithmic or logarithmic .",
    "we study the quantile - based correlation for six different quantile pairs @xmath27 .",
    "figure  [ fig : single ] shows the quantile - based correlation for abercrombie & fitch co. ( anf ) .",
    "the @xmath28 quantiles correlate only the largest negative returns , while the @xmath29 quantiles indirectly correlate the largest positive returns .",
    "this requires further explanation . in principle , the @xmath29 quantiles correlate , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcf ] ) , all returns which are smaller than the @xmath22-quantile .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement that the largest @xmath39% of returns are correlated , because if we switch both lesser signs in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcf ] ) to greater signs the quantile correlation function will not change as discussed in section  [ ch : qcf ] . in both cases",
    "the correlation is non - zero and decays up to lags of roughly one hour to zero .",
    "we notice that the absolute values of the correlation are smaller to what is usually observed by using the autocorrelation of absolute or squared returns .",
    "this is due to the filtered time series which contain only zeroes and ones .",
    "hence , the absolute correlation of these reduced time series is smaller .",
    "the @xmath21 quantiles correspond to the correlation of the sign of the returns if the distribution of returns has zero mean and is symmetric . as for",
    "the autocorrelation of returns this function should be zero , which is the case , _",
    "i.e. _ , all values are within the confidence interval and therefore not significant . otherwise there would be arbitrage opportunities .",
    "for empirical return distributions , we can not assume that the distribution of returns is perfectly symmetric .",
    "hence , the shape of the correlation function for the @xmath21 quantiles differs within the confidence interval . for stochastic processes with symmetric return distributions",
    "we find zero correlation in section  [ ch : garch ]    if the probabilities for the quantiles are chosen equally , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath40 , the quantile - based correlation functions must be symmetric for positive and negative lags .",
    "in contrast , for different quantiles , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath41 , we observe significant asymmetries . at first glance",
    "the asymmetry in the @xmath30 quantiles may be hard to spot , but a close look reveals that the area under the curve is smaller for positive lags .",
    "we calculate the normalized difference @xmath42 between the areas under the curve for negative and positive lags , where @xmath43 is @xmath44 the measure lies in the interval @xmath45 $ ] . for example , if the area under the curve is zero for negative lags and greater than zero for positive lags the measure is minus one .",
    "if the area under the curve is equally distributed between positive and negative lags , the normalized difference is zero .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : diff ] .",
    "we find that the area under the curve for negative lags of the quantile correlation function is 8% ( 2007 ) and 5% ( 2008 ) larger compared to the area under the curve for positive lags .",
    "[ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     here , we have to be careful with the interpretation of the probabilities @xmath6 and @xmath14 .",
    "what we see in figure  [ fig : single ] is the correlation of the smallest @xmath39% of returns with the smallest @xmath46% of returns .",
    "this correlation is negative . if we want to correlate the smallest @xmath39% with the largest @xmath39% of returns we have to flip the sign of the quantile - based correlation function , because this is equal to change the second lesser sign in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcf ] ) to a greater sign .",
    "doing so will invert only the second filtered time series , which leads to a change of the sign of the quantile - based correlation function .",
    "therefore , we observe an asymmetry in the positive correlation of the smallest and largest returns .",
    "the slowly decaying correlation is reminiscent of the volatility clustering observed for equal probabilities @xmath40 .",
    "however , the asymmetry indicates the appearance of the leverage effect .",
    "figure  [ fig : all ] shows the average quantile - based correlation function for all stocks from the s&p-500 index in the year 2007 ( black ) and 2008 ( grey ) .",
    "the basic features remain the same compared to a single stock .",
    "another way to visualize the quantile correlation function is to look at a probability - probability plot for a fixed lag .",
    "the advantage is that it gives a more complete picture for different probability pairs with the caveat of only showing one lag .",
    "the result for all stocks from the s&p 500 index in 2007 , which corresponds to figure  [ fig : all ] , are shown in figure  [ fig : qcf ] for lags of 120 , 600 , 1200 and 3600 seconds .",
    "importantly the plots also contain the information for the corresponding negative lags , because if we swap the probabilities @xmath47 in equation  ( [ eq : qcf2 ] ) the lag axis also changes its sign @xmath48 .",
    "the peaks for small probabilities around @xmath28 and large probabilities around @xmath29 are clearly visible and decay for larger lags .",
    "we also observe the asymmetries for probabilities @xmath41 on the left and right hand side of the plot . around the positive and negative peaks at the edges of the plot",
    "we observe plateau like areas .    for figure  [ fig : index ] we calculated a homogeneously weighted index from all stocks .",
    "we observe that the asymmetry for the @xmath30 quantiles becomes more pronounced .",
    "this behavior is connected to the `` correlation leverage effect '' studied by  @xcite .",
    "the authors find that the volatility of the index is comprised of the volatility of the single stocks and the average correlation between these stocks , which leads to stronger leverage effect for indices .",
    "however , the absolute values of the anti - correlation are smaller compared to figure  [ fig : all ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : garch ] shows the quantile - based correlation function for three exemplary processes of the garch family .",
    "for all three cases we use garch processes of the order ( 1,1 ) , see  @xcite for a review .",
    "the garch returns are modeled by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the stochastic part , _",
    "i.e. _ , a random variable drawn from a strong white noise process and the conditional variances @xmath51 are @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are coefficients .",
    "the egarch(1,1 ) models the logarithmic variances according to @xmath55 with the asymmetry parameter @xmath56 .",
    "finally , the gjr - garch(1,1 ) uses @xmath57 with the indicator function @xmath58 for the conditional variances .",
    "we choose the same parameters for all processes as far as possible with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and drift @xmath62 . for the egarch and gjr - garch we choose an asymmetry parameter of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the different sign for the asymmetry parameter is due to the construction of the egarch and gjr - garch .",
    "we emphasize that the parameters are chosen to receive pronounced characteristics for the quantile correlation .",
    "fitting the process to empirical data will be investigated in the following sections . in accordance with the literature and the ` rugarch `  package  @xcite for r , we denote the garch parameters with @xmath65 and @xmath54 and do not confuse them with the probabilities for the @xmath27 quantiles .",
    "the classic garch process ( grey ) is symmetric by design .",
    "unsurprisingly , we observe no significant asymmetries .",
    "we picked two common modifications to the classic garch , the egarch ( black ) and gjr - garch ( dashed ) , which have an additional asymmetry parameter .",
    "the egarch process only shows a clustering of large positive returns and no correlation for small negative returns . for the @xmath30 quantiles",
    "only positive lags show a negative correlation , while negative lags have zero correlation .",
    "the gjr - garch shows clustering of large negative and positive returns and asymmetric non - zero correlations for the @xmath30 quantiles .",
    "this asymmetry is also observable in the absolute height of the quantile - based correlation function for the @xmath28 and @xmath29 quantiles .    here",
    ", the quantile - based correlation of the @xmath21 quantiles is really the correlation of the return sign , because the innovations for the garch processes are drawn from a normal distribution .",
    "therefore , the distribution of returns is symmetric and the quantile - based correlation function is zero .    in figure  [ fig : qcf2 ] , we present the probability - probability plot for the gjr - garch and egarch for two fixed lags . while the gjr - garch qualitatively captures the overall shape quite good , we find striking differences for the egarch",
    ". however , the gjr - garch does not reveal the plateau like structure we have seen for the average of the s&p 500 stocks .",
    "the plot for gjr - garch shows the peaks around the @xmath28 and @xmath29 probabilities and also the asymmetries around the @xmath30 probabilities .",
    "in contrast the egarch has a positive peak around the @xmath66 probabilities and a negative peak round the @xmath28 probabilities .",
    "while the asymmetric garch processes indeed show an asymmetric behavior in the correlation of very small and large returns the quantile correlation function uncovers differences to empirical data . for the @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    "the gjr - garch and egarch show only non - zero behavior for the positive and negative lags , respectively .",
    "in addition , the egarch only shows non - zero correlations for positive lags for the @xmath30 quantiles .          from the discussion in the previous section",
    "we believe that the gjr - garch is the best candidate of the three processes to describe the empirical data .",
    "therefore , we fit the gjr - garch model to the equally weighted index of the s&p 500 stocks for 2007 and 2008 for each trading day .",
    "this yields @xmath34 individual parameter sets @xmath69 per year . for each parameter set ,",
    "we simulate a time series and calculate the quantile correlation function .",
    "the average for the years 2007 and 2008 is shown in figure  [ fig : gjrgarch1 ] . however , this approach does not yield results which agree with the empirical results for the index , see figure  [ fig : index ] .",
    "we observe a much slower decay of the quantile correlation function for the @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 probabilities .",
    "the asymmetries are smaller for 2007 , where the normalized difference for the area under the curve differs by @xmath70% in contrast to @xmath71% for the index and for 2008 it is negligible ( 1% ) . for the @xmath67 and @xmath68 probabilities we find a speed of the decay which is similar to the empirical data at least for 2007 . however , the qualitative shape of the quantile correlation function does not agree with the empirical data .",
    "the fit is performed on the non - overlapping one - minute returns , which shortens the time series from 22200 to 370 entries .",
    "we conjecture that the intraday time series are too short , which leads to poor fits and unrealistic parameter sets on some days which are biasing the results .",
    "the first approach where we use @xmath34 time series generated from individual parameter sets obtained by fitting each day does not provide a satisfying accordance with the empirical data . here , we generate one parameter set for each year by averaging the @xmath34 parameter sets from the previous section and than simulate @xmath34 time series for both sets each .",
    "we calculate the quantile correlation function for each time series and average the results . for 2007",
    "we find @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . in 2008",
    "we find @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "at least for 2007 we are able to receive results which on an absolute scale reproduce the empirical data rather well .",
    "however , we still observe the qualitative discrepancies especially for the @xmath67 and @xmath68 probabilities .",
    "the asymmetry is clearly visible and we find a normalized difference between positive and negative lags of @xmath82 . for 2008",
    "we obtain a ten times smaller asymmetry parameter @xmath56 in comparison to 2007 .",
    "as the asymmetry parameter can be negative or positive between the trading days they can compensate to nearly zero .",
    "thus , we observe no significant asymmetries for 2008 .    both approaches to fit the gjr - garch to the empirical intraday data fail to deliver satisfying results .",
    "the quantile correlation function gives a detailed picture of the temporal dependencies in the underlying time series .",
    "it provides information which goes beyond the autocorrelation of the absolute or squared returns and uncovers asymmetries in the lagged correlations , which are connected to the leverage effect .    beyond its usefulness for analyzing empirical time series",
    "it is a powerful tool to find subtle differences in time series obtained from stochastic processes which are designed to reproduce certain features . as an example we studied two stochastic processes of the garch family with asymmetry parameters and found differences compared to empirical data . replicating all temporal features of return time series",
    "is crucial to achieve improved volatility forecasting .",
    "@xcite find that taking the leverage effect into account significantly improves the out - of - sample volatility forecast .",
    "@xcite analyze among others a variation of the gjr - garch and further support the importance of including asymmetries .",
    "@xcite notice that a garch(1,1 ) process is clearly inferior to models which account for the leverage effect with regard to the volatility forecast for stocks . in case of exchange rates they find no evidence that the garch(1,1 ) model is outperformed by more complex models .",
    "numerous studies indicate that there is no definite answer to the question which stochastic process yields the best volatility forecast for financial data , see @xcite for an extensive review . in particular",
    ", there is no consensus whether egarch or gjr - garch performs best , see for example @xcite .",
    "the results largely depend on the data set under consideration , the time horizon , the test procedure and the stability of the fit .",
    "the quantile correlation function provides a means to further investigate why these deviating results occur for different data sets .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate every stochastic process , see  @xcite for an overview of garch type processes .",
    "however , we advertize the reader to use the quantile correlation function to study his favorite stochastic process and its temporal dependencies in more detail . in general the quantile correlation function",
    "can serve as a sensitive tool to examine the agreement between stochastic processes and empirical time series .",
