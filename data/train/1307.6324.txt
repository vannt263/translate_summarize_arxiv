    "<S> we propose a promising two - dimensional nano - sheet of sic@xmath0 ( sic@xmath0-pentagon ) consisting of tetrahedral silicon atoms and triple - linked carbon atoms in a fully - pentagon network . </S>",
    "<S> the sic@xmath0-pentagon with buckled configuration is more favorable than its planar counterpart and previously proposed sic@xmath0-silagraphene with tetra - coordinate silicon atoms ; and its dynamical stability is confirmed through phonon analyzing . buckled sic@xmath0-pentagon is an indirect - band - gap semiconductor with a gap of 1.388 ev . </S>",
    "<S> however , its one - dimensional nanoribbons can be metals or semiconductors depending on the edge type , shape , and decoration . finally , we propose a method to produce the buckled sic@xmath0@xmath1pentagon through chemical exfoliation on the @xmath2@xmath1sic(001)-c@xmath3 sdb surface . </S>"
