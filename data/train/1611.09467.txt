    "developing efficient algorithms to simulate strongly correlated quantum many - body systems is in the center of the modern condensed matter physics . in the context of strongly interacting systems , where the conventional perturbation theory fails ,",
    "revealing their physical nature is mainly dependent on the numerical simulation methods , such as , exact diagonalization ( ed ) , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite .",
    "these numerical methods have been widely used in studying strongly correlated quantum systems and have achieved great success . however , developing new efficient algorithms is still urgent , because of the limitations of the previous methods : e.g. , ed encounters the so - called `` exponential wall '' ; qmc suffers from the notorious sign problem for fermionic and frustrated systems@xcite ; and dmrg is limited to 1d or quasi-1d systems and does not work well for higher dimension systems@xcite .",
    "recently , inspired by the insight of quantum entanglement in the perspective of quantum information theory , the algorithms based on the tensor network states ( tns ) , particularly , matrix product states ( mps)@xcite and projected entangled pair states ( peps)@xcite , which is a natural extension of mps to higher dimensions that satisfies both area law@xcite and size consistency@xcite , have been proved to be powerful simulation methods to exploit the strongly correlated systems . the algorithms based on tns offer great opportunities to solve some long standing two - dimensional problems .    nevertheless , there are still some difficulties hindering the power of the simulation due to the complexity of peps and our limited computing capability",
    ". one of the major difficulties is how to efficiently obtain the optimal peps with large bond dimension @xmath0 . generally , to make the obtained peps converge to the exact ground state of the system , the virtual bond dimension @xmath0 should be as large as possible . however , the computational cost increases fast with the increasing @xmath0 .",
    "originally , an imaginary time evolution method was implemented to optimize the peps wave functions with the computational cost scales as o@xmath3 for square lattice with open boundary condition ( obc )  @xcite , because one needs to contract the whole tensor network to calculate the environment of the local tensors .",
    "such high computational cost limits the bond dimension @xmath0 to quite small values ( such as @xmath0=4 in ref [ ] ) , and as a result , the application of the method is limited . to reduce the calculation cost , an imaginary time evolution with simple update ( su ) algorithm",
    "was proposed  @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the environment of a tensor is approximated by products of some diagonal matrices , and therefore it substantially reduces the calculation cost in the update process to o@xmath4 by combining qr / lq decompositions when dealing with nearest neighbor ( nn ) interactions  @xcite .",
    "however , the su imaginary time evolution is a local optimization method , where the environment of the local tensor may be over simplified .",
    "consequently , the optimized peps may not converge to the real ground state of the system with desired precision , especially for finite systems  @xcite .",
    "great effort has been made to improve the results of su  @xcite . recently",
    "a cluster update method@xcite , allowing a tradeoff between computation cost and precision , is proposed to improve the accuracy systematically by approximating the environment of local tensors with different clusters of sizes .",
    "based on the cluster update method , a full update ( fu ) method @xcite , meaning taking the whole lattice into account , can significantly improve the accuracy from that of the su .",
    "unfortunately , the computational scaling of the fu is still o@xmath3 , which prevents one from using larger @xmath0 in peps .    besides the difficulty to efficiently find the ground state of a system , how to efficiently calculate the correlation functions is another one .",
    "a direct contraction method has a high computation scaling of o@xmath3 for obc systems ( the same as the cost to get the environment of local tensors ) , so even if an accurate ground state with large @xmath0 is obtained , the time cost for computing correlation functions may be still beyond our current capability .",
    "to extend the ability to investigate tns of larger @xmath0 , monte carlo ( mc ) sampling techniques have been introduced by sandvik et.al  @xcite , based on one dimensional mps , and schuch et.al  @xcite , based on string - bond states@xcite in two - dimension systems , which reduce dramatically the scaling of computational cost to the bond dimension @xmath0 , compared to the standard contraction method . however , even though the mc sampling method has been used to calculate some physical quantities for a given peps  @xcite , it has not been applied to optimize peps wave functions themselves .    in this work , we demonstrate a global gradient optimization ( go ) method combined with the mc sampling technique to optimize the peps ground state . during the process , the energy and energy gradients are calculated through the mc sampling technique which dramatically reduces the scaling of the calculation to o@xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the sampling sweeps , significantly less than that of the variational method and time evolution fu method with o@xmath3 .",
    "after we obtain the optimized peps , we may calculate the correlation functions through the mc sampling technique , with the same computational scaling .",
    "this methods may further take the advantages of massive parallelization , and therefore allow us to investigate strongly correlated quantum systems using peps with much larger @xmath0 .",
    "we benchmark the method using the heisenberg model and the @xmath1-@xmath2 model on a square lattice .",
    "we calculate the ground state using the peps with bond dimension up to @xmath0=10 .",
    "our results show that the method can give impressive accuracy that is significantly better than the su , and even fu .",
    "and ket @xmath7 is needed to be contracted to obtain physical quantities by summing over the physical index in the standard contraction scheme .",
    "( b ) boundary - mpo method is used to contract a double - layer tensor network with computational scaling o@xmath8.(c ) a single - layer tensor network @xmath7 with some give spin configuration @xmath9 is needed to be contracted to obtain physical quantities in the mc scheme .",

[",
    "fig : contract](c),where @xmath17=@xmath18 is a five - index tensor located on site ( @xmath14,@xmath15 ) .",
    "it has one physical index @xmath19 whose value is from @xmath20 to @xmath12 and four virtual indices @xmath21 corresponding to four nearest neighbors .",
    "the dimension of each virtual bond is @xmath0 , except for those on open edges , whose dimensions are set to one .",
    "the `` @xmath22 '' denotes the contraction over all the virtual indices of the tensor network .",
    "the number of the parameters in the peps is determined by the bond dimension @xmath0 .",
    "some tricky many - body states ( e.g. , spin liquid ) require large @xmath0 to give an accurate description .",
    "peps provide systematically improvable variational wave functions to approximate the exact many - particle states .",
    "our goal is to optimize the peps wave functions and obtain the physical quantities of the corresponding many - body ground states .",
    "the contraction of the peps plays the central role and costs the dominant resource in our calculation . to calculate the environment of the local tensor during the optimization and the physical quantities for a given peps wave function , we need to contract the peps",
    "however , exactly contracting peps is np - hard .",
    "@xcite the bond dimensions will grow exponentially with the number of the lines contracted during the process .",
    "therefore a truncation of the bond dimension is necessary during the contraction  @xcite . in the standard contraction methods to calculate energy or correlation functions ,",
    "one has to contract a double - layer tensor network with bond dimension @xmath23 composed of both bra @xmath24 and ket @xmath7 by summing over the physical index , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contract](a ) . a boundary - mpo with bond dimension @xmath25 approximation is introduced to avoid exponential growth of the bond dimension of the tensor network during contracting process@xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contract](b )",
    ". therefore , even with this approximation , the computational scaling of the whole contraction is still o@xmath8 for obc .",
    "it has been shown , to get enough precision the cut - off bond dimension @xmath25 should be proportional to @xmath23 independent of the system size @xcite , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the computational scaling to contract the whole peps is as high as o@xmath3 for obc .",
    "the computational scaling for pbc is even higher with o@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "to reduce the high scaling of the methods , monte carlo sampling techniques have been introduced by several groups  @xcite in which the contraction over physical indices is replaced by the mc sampling over the `` spin configurations '' . in this algorithm ,",
    "the energy is reexpressed as follows , @xmath28 with @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the spin configuration and @xmath31 is the weight of the spin configuration .",
    "@xmath32 is the normalization factor .",
    "the energy is evaluated through mc sampling according to the configuration weight @xmath33 . unlike the standard contraction method , in the mc scheme",
    ", the most time consuming part is to calculate @xmath34 , which is obtained by contracting a single - layer ( instead of two layers in the original methods ) peps with bond dimension @xmath0 with fixed spin configurations , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contract](c ) .",
    "similar with boundary - mpo method , a boundary - mps method is used to approximately contract the single - layer tensor network , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contract](d)@xcite .",
    "the scaling of this process is o@xmath10 .",
    "usually , @xmath35 is enough for most problems , therefore total computational scaling to calculate the energy is o@xmath36 .",
    "we note that the cut - off bond dimension @xmath37@xmath38@xmath0 of the single - layer tns in the mc sampling method is corresponding to the cut - off bond dimension @xmath25@xmath38@xmath23 in the double - layer peps in the original contraction methods .",
    "the energy derivation with respect to the tensor element @xmath39 can also be evaluated by mc sampling as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the physical index of tensor @xmath42 located on site @xmath43 , and @xmath44 denotes the mc average .",
    "@xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is @xmath48 @xmath49 is nothing but a tensor summing over all the indices except those linked with site @xmath43 on the fixed configuration @xmath50 .",
    "the scaling of calculating the energy gradient is also o@xmath36 .",
    "once we have the energy gradients , we can adopt the go methods to calculate the peps ground state .",
    "the peps energy function can be mapped to a classical mechanic system by treating tensor elements as generalized coordinates .",
    "the total energy can then be optimized via the steepest decent methods , or molecular dynamic methods,@xcite making full use of the energy gradients . by combining with the replica exchange method",
    ", local minima can be escaped efficiently,@xcite making it a powerful scheme to simulate the ground state of complex systems @xcite . another efficient way of optimizing the tensor is proposed by sandvik et.al ,  @xcite which uses only the sign of energy gradients .",
    "this is very useful when mc sampling sweeps is not very large , and the energy gradients are not very accurately calculated .",
    "there are several advantages of the go method .",
    "firstly , unlike the local optimization methods , the go is a global optimization method . in principle , one can potentially approach the true global ground state if the simulation runs long enough .",
    "secondly , the mc sweeps can be easily and massively parallelized .",
    "thirdly , it is easy to deal with the systems beyond nearest neighbor interactions , such as @xmath1-@xmath2 square heisenberg model . in standard contraction methods",
    ", the long range interactions will dramatically increase the computation cost .",
    "for example , according to the contraction method mentioned above , when dealing with the next nearest neighbor terms in @xmath1-@xmath2 model with obc , the calculation scaling can be as high as o@xmath51 if @xmath26 .",
    "the computation cost will increase rapidly with the range of the interaction .",
    "however in our method , only the weight @xmath34 of a single - layer tensor network needs to be contracted , and the long range interactions can be easily calculated in the `` spin '' representation , and therefore the computational cost is still o@xmath36 , no matter what the range of the interaction is .",
    "to save the computational time , the time evolution method with su,@xcite a fast local optimization method , is adopted to give a good approximation to the exact ground state which services as the starting point for the further optimization  @xcite .",
    "the peps wave function is then optimized via the go method .",
    "when employing simple updating , the hamiltonian will be split into several parts comprised of mutually commuting terms , and suzuki - trotter expansion@xcite is used to expand the evolution operator approximately .",
    "the tensors are updated site by site by singular value decomposition ( svd ) and the bond dimensions are truncated back to @xmath0 . with the help of qr decomposition , the computational scaling of this process is o@xmath4 if only nn interactions are present ,  @xcite and therefore , it is possible to use very large @xmath0 ( e.g. @xmath52 20 ) in the su method .",
    "we perform imaginary time evolution starting with time step @xmath53=0.01 until the tensors are converged , i.e. , @xmath54 .",
    "we then reduce the time step to @xmath55 , and keep optimizing the peps until it is converged under the new time step .",
    "when optimizing the peps with large bond dimension @xmath0 , we do not directly start with random tensors .",
    "instead , we always start with a random peps state with smallest @xmath0 ( usually @xmath56 ) , and the converged tensors are used as the initial states for larger @xmath0 .",
    "we gradually increase @xmath0 to the desired values .    with the peps optimized by su , a go is adopted with tensor elements varying as follows : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a random real number ranged from @xmath59 to @xmath20 which is used to avoid trapping at local minima , and @xmath60 is the step length . in our test , we first set @xmath61 with the number of mc sampling @xmath62 .",
    "the total energy decreases significantly after about 50 steps .",
    "we then set @xmath63 with @xmath6450000 for a further optimization until the energy converges which usually takes about another 60 steps .",
    "it is notable that we only need the correct signs of energy derivations ( @xmath65 ) instead of absolute values in this method .",
    "@xcite alternatively , one can also use the molecular dynamics method described in ref .",
    "[ ] to optimize the peps .    in the following section , we will compare the results obtained from our method with the results obtained with the previous su and fu methods for the @xmath1-@xmath2 model on square lattices .",
