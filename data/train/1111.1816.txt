    "in this article , we will consider the following @xmath1-valued stochastic differential equation ( sde ) @xmath2}.\\ ] ] here @xmath3 is a given initial condition , @xmath4 is an @xmath5-dimensional fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) with hurst parameter @xmath6 , the unknown parameter @xmath7 lies in a certain set @xmath8 which will be specified later on , @xmath9 is a family of drift coefficients with @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are assumed to be known diffusion coefficients .",
    "let us recall that @xmath12 is a centred gaussian process defined on a complete probability space @xmath13 .",
    "its law is thus characterized by its covariance function , which is defined by @xmath14 the variance of the increments of @xmath12 is then given by @xmath15 and this implies that almost surely the fbm paths are @xmath16-hlder continuous for any @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath18 , fbm coincides with the usual brownian motion , converting the family @xmath19 into the most natural generalization of this classical process . in the current paper",
    "we assume that the hurst coefficient satisfies @xmath0 and we focus on the estimation of the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "note that the hurst parameter and the diffusion coefficients can be estimated via the quadratic variation of @xmath21 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "estimators for the unknown parameter in equation ( [ eq : sde ] ) based on continuous observation of @xmath21 have been studied e.g. in @xcite .",
    "estimators based on discrete time data , which are important for practical applications , are then obtained via discretization . however , to the best of our knowledge no genuine estimators based on discrete time data have been analyzed yet .",
    "we propose here a least square estimator for @xmath7 based on discrete observations of the process @xmath21 at times @xmath22 .",
    "for simplicity , we shall take equally spaced observation times with @xmath23 with given @xmath24 .",
    "we call our method least square - type procedure , insofar as we consider a quadratic statistics of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 for any @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "let us now describe the assumptions under which we shall work , starting from a standard hypothesis on the parameter set @xmath8 :    [ hyp : theta ] the set @xmath8 is compactly embedded in @xmath29 for a given @xmath30 .    in order to describe the assumptions on our coefficients @xmath31 , we will use the following notation for partial derivatives :    let @xmath32 be a @xmath33 function for @xmath34 .",
    "then for any tuple @xmath35 , we set @xmath36 for @xmath37 . moreover , we will write @xmath38 resp . @xmath39 for the jacobi - matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    with this notation in mind ,",
    "our drift coefficients and their derivatives will satisfy a polynomial growth condition , plus an inward condition which is traditional for estimation procedures in the brownian diffusion case ( see e.g @xcite ) :    [ hyp : f - coercive ] we have @xmath42 and there exist constants @xmath43 and @xmath44 such that :    _ ( i ) _ for every @xmath45 and @xmath46 we have @xmath47    _ ( ii ) _ for every @xmath48 and @xmath46 the following growth bounds are satisfied : @xmath49 the solution of equation ( [ eq : sde ] ) converges for @xmath50 to a stationary and ergodic stochastic process @xmath51 , see the next section .",
    "finally , we also assume that our - drift coefficient is of gradient - type , i.e. :    [ hyp : f - gradtype ] there exists a function @xmath52 such that @xmath53    with those assumptions in mind , we obtain the following convergence result :    [ thm : lse - convergence_prev ] assume that the hypotheses [ hyp : theta ] , [ hyp : f - coercive ] and [ hyp : f - gradtype ] are satisfied for equation ( [ eq : sde ] ) and that we moreover have @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath54 be defined by ( [ eq : def - qn ] ) .",
    "then we have @xmath55 in the @xmath56-almost sure sense .",
    "this convergence is in contrast to the case @xmath18 , i.e. to the case of sdes with additive brownian noise .",
    "there it holds @xmath57 in the @xmath56-almost sure sense , see remark [ h12 ] , and usually the consistent least squares estimator @xmath58 is considered , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the difference in the limits and is due to the higher smoothness and long - range dependence of fractional brownian motion for @xmath0 .",
    "our estimator can thus be seen as a  zero squares ",
    "estimator instead of a classical least square estimator . in order to show its convergence",
    ", we shall work under the following natural identifiability assumption :    [ hyp : identifiability ] for any @xmath20 , we have @xmath59    with this additional hypothesis",
    ", the main result of the current article is the consistency of the zero squares estimator based on the statistics @xmath60 :    [ thm : lse - convergence ] assume that the hypotheses [ hyp : theta ] , [ hyp : f - coercive ] , [ hyp : f - gradtype ] and [ hyp : identifiability ] are satisfied for equation ( [ eq : sde ] ) and let @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath54 be defined by ( [ eq : def - qn ] ) , and let @xmath61 .",
    "then for any @xmath20 , we have @xmath62 in the @xmath56-almost sure sense .",
    "note that minimizing @xmath63 is of course equivalent to finding the zero of @xmath64 .",
    "let us shortly compare theorem [ thm : lse - convergence ] with the existing literature on estimation procedures for fbm driven equations :    \\(i ) most of the previous results , see e.g. @xcite , deal with the one - dimensional fractional ornstein - uhlenbeck process in a continuous observation setting . in particular",
    ", for this process simple continuous time least - square estimators are obtained in @xcite , for which also covergence rates and asymptotic error distributions are derived .",
    "compared to these results our estimation procedure covers a broad class of ergodic multi - dimensional equations and relies on discrete data only .",
    "\\(ii ) a general estimation procedure based on moment matching is established in @xcite .",
    "however , the main assumption in @xcite is that many independent observations of sample paths over a short time interval are available , which is not the case in many practical situations where rather one sample path is discretely observed for a long time period .",
    "let us also mention the article  @xcite , in which a general discrete data maximum likelihood type procedure has been designed for parameter estimation in both the drift and diffusion coefficients , however without proof of consistency .",
    "\\(iii ) our current work probably compares best with the maximum likelihood estimator analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the latter pioneering reference focused on one - dimensional sdes of the form @xmath65 with @xmath66 satisfying suitable regularity assumptions .",
    "strong consistency is obtained for the continuous time estimator and also for a discretized version of the estimator .",
    "however , the discretized estimator involves rather complicated operators related to the kernel functions arising in the wiener - integral representation of fbm , which are avoided in our approach .",
    "moreover , in contrast to @xcite the consistency proof for our estimator does not rely on malliavin calculus methods .",
    "so , in view of the existing results in the literature , theorem [ thm : lse - convergence ] can be seen a step towards simple and implementable parameter estimation procedures for sdes driven by fbm .",
    "finally , let us comment on the assumptions we have imposed on the drift coefficient and on the hurst parameter :    \\(a ) the hypothesis of theorem [ thm : lse - convergence_prev ] are standard for the case @xmath18 , except hypothesis  [ hyp : f - gradtype ] which restricts us to gradient - type drift coefficients .",
    "we require this condition to show an ergodic - type result for weighted sums of the increments of fbm , see lemma  [ ergodic_sum : fbm ] .",
    "however , this hypothesis [ hyp : f - gradtype ] is also implicitly present in the additional condition of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) .",
    "\\(b ) it can easily be shown that whenever @xmath67 is a one - dimensional coefficient ( namely for @xmath68 ) , hypothesis  [ hyp : identifiability ] is satisfied if the drift coefficient is of the form @xmath69 for some @xmath70 and if the stationary solution is non - degenerate , i.e. we have @xmath71 .",
    "the latter conditions hold in particular in the case of the ergodic fractional ornstein - uhlenbeck process",
    ". it would be nice to obtain criteria for richer classes of examples , but this would rely on differentiability and non - degeneracy properties of the map @xmath72 ( see @xcite in the markovian case ) .",
    "we wish to investigate this question in future works .",
    "\\(c ) even if the noise enters additively in our equation , we still need the assumption @xmath0 in order to prove theorem [ thm : lse - convergence ] .",
    "indeed , this hypothesis ensures the convergence of some deterministic and stochastic riemann sums in the computations below ( see remark  [ rmk : h - greater - one - half ] for further details ) . whether an adaptation of the proposed zero squares estimator is also convergent in the case",
    "@xmath73 remains an open problem .",
    "let us finish this introduction with the simplest example of an equation which satisfies the above assumptions : namely the one - dimensional fractional ornstein - uhlenbeck process given by @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "the solution of this sde reads as @xmath76 for @xmath50 this process converges to the stationary fractional ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xmath77 see e.g. @xcite . here",
    "straightforward computations yield the explicit estimator @xmath78 notice that even in the case of the fractional ornstein - uhlenbeck process , we could neither proof the consistency nor show the inconsistency of our estimator for @xmath73 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : preliminaries ] we give some auxiliary results on stochastic calculus for fractional brownian motion .",
    "section [ sec : proof - thms ] is then devoted to the proof of our main theorems .",
    "to deduce the ergodic properties of sde ( [ eq : sde ] ) we will work without loss of generality on the canonical probability space @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath80 equipped with the compact open topology , @xmath81 is the corresponding borel-@xmath82-algebra and @xmath83 is the distribution of the fractional brownian motion @xmath12 , which is consequently given here by the canonical process @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "together with the shift operators @xmath86 defined by @xmath87 the canonical probability space defines an ergodic metric dynamical system , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in particular , the measure @xmath83 is invariant to the shift operators @xmath88 , i.e. the shifted process @xmath89 is still an @xmath5-dimensional fractional brownian motion and for any integrable random variable @xmath90 we have @xmath91 for @xmath83-almost all @xmath92 .",
    "owing to the results in section 4 of @xcite we have the following :    [ thm : attractor ] let hypothesis [ hyp : f - coercive ] hold .",
    "then for any @xmath20 the following holds :    _ ( i ) _ equation admits a unique solution @xmath21 in @xmath93 for all @xmath94 .    _",
    "( ii ) _ there exists a random variable @xmath95 such that @xmath96 for @xmath83-almost all @xmath92 .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath97 for all @xmath98 .",
    "note that the law of @xmath99 must coincide with the attracting invariant measure for ( [ eq : sde ] ) given in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "moreover , proceeding as in @xcite we have :    [ prop : bnd - moments - y ] assume hypothesis [ hyp : f - coercive ] holds true .",
    "then for any @xmath20 and @xmath100 there exist constants @xmath101 such that @xmath102    the integrability of @xmath99 now implies the ergodicity of equation ( [ eq : sde ] ) :    [ prop : ergod - y ] assume hypothesis [ hyp : f - coercive ] holds true .",
    "then for any @xmath20 and any @xmath103 such that @xmath104 for some @xmath105 , @xmath44 , we have @xmath106    since the shift operator is ergodic and @xmath107 has polynomial growth , we have @xmath108 moreover , since @xmath109 by theorem [ thm : attractor ] and @xmath107 is polynomially lipschitz , the assertion easily follows .",
