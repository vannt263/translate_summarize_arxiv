    "four families of functions , depending on three real variables , called here as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3functions , are described .",
    "each family is complete within its functional space @xcite and orthogonal when integrated over a finite region @xmath10 of real euclidean space @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the functions of each family are discretely orthogonal on a fraction of a lattice in @xmath10 of density of our choice and of symmetry dictated by the simple lie algebras @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the definition of these functions for any number of variables and some of their properties are described in  @xcite .",
    "the first two families of functions are also called @xmath0 and @xmath1functions .",
    "they are well known as constituents of irreducible characters of compact simple lie groups .",
    "indeed , the irreducible characters can be expressed as finite sums of @xmath0functions with integer coefficients called dominant weight multiplicities .",
    "ratio of two @xmath1functions appears in the weyl character formula @xcite .",
    "two other families are called @xmath3 and @xmath2 functions .",
    "inspired by the weyl character formula , we can consider so called hybrid characters , i.e. the ratio of two @xmath3 or @xmath2 functions .",
    "it is possible to show that they decompose into the sums of @xmath0functions with integer coefficients .",
    "the explicit formulas for coefficients are in  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath0functions play an important role in the definition of jacobi polynomials @xcite .",
    "one can also remark that the characters and the hybrid characters could be derived as special cases of jacobi polynomials .",
    "however , important insight into the properties of these functions would have been lost in the generality of the approach .",
    "for example , their discrete orthogonality appears to be outside of that approach , which is a handicap in the world of ever growing amount of digital data . from our perspective particularly useful are the four families discretized within @xmath10 .",
    "the problem of discretization of the @xmath0 and @xmath1functions , which is now over 20 years old  @xcite , is carried over to the dicretization of the other two families in  @xcite .",
    "our motivation for studying these families of functions is guided by ever increasing need to process three - dimensional digital data .",
    "discrete orthogonality of these functions open new efficient possibilities for precisely that .",
    "moreover , the @xmath4 symmetry imposed by the weight lattices of @xmath5 and @xmath6 should be advantageous in describing quantum systems possessing such a symmetry , as well as in some problems of quantum information theory .",
    "there are two undoubtedly interesting extensions of this work .",
    "the first one is to combine pairs of functions from the present four families into so called @xmath12functions , two - variable generalization of the common exponential function are found in @xcite . in this way we can find six families of functions , which again are orthogonal as continuous and also as discrete functions over finite extension of @xmath10 .",
    "the second possible extension of this work is to three - variables orthogonal polynomials .",
    "curiously , the extensive literature about the polynomials contains little information about their discretization .",
    "this work opens a way to study these problems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 reviews some basic notations concerning the root systems and weyl groups .",
    "we present the short and long fundamental domains of the affine weyl group of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in section 3",
    "we define four families of orbit functions . in section 4",
    "we describe in detail orbit functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 including their discrete orthogonality and discrete transforms .",
    "consider a simple lie algebra of rank three and its ordered set of simple roots @xmath13 .",
    "the set @xmath14 forms a basis of the three - dimensional real euclidean space @xmath11 @xcite and satisfies certain specific conditions .",
    "there are only two simple lie algebras of rank three which , with respect to the standard scalar product @xmath15 , have two different lenghts of their simple roots  @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the set @xmath14 is for these two cases decomposed into the set of short simple roots @xmath16 and the set of long simple roots @xmath17 : @xmath18 the set @xmath14 is usually described by the coxeter ",

    "in addition to the @xmath23basis of simple roots and the @xmath24basis , the following two bases are useful : the weight @xmath25basis , defined by the relations @xmath26 and the coweight @xmath27basis , given by renormalization as @xmath28    standardly , the root lattice @xmath29 is the set of all integer linear combinations of the simple roots @xmath30 and the coroot @xmath31 lattice is @xmath32 the weight lattice and the coweight lattice are given standardly as @xmath33 two important subsets of the weight lattice @xmath34 are the cone of dominant weights @xmath35 and the cone of strictly dominant weights @xmath36 : @xmath37    the decomposition induces two subsets of @xmath35 which are crucial for description of the orbit functions .",
