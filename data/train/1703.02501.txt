    "also , analyses of @xmath25 , 6.3 and 6.7 @xmath26-ray burst ( grb ) damping wing absorptions indicate that @xmath27 could increase with redshift with the constraints of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 and reionization might not be complete yet at @xmath19 ( * ? ? ?",

    "another probe of reionization is ly@xmath1 emitters ( laes ) .",
    "their ly@xmath1 luminosity function ( lf ) could decline as neutral hydrogen absorbs or scatters ly@xmath1 photons from laes @xcite .",
    "according to observations of laes to date , ly@xmath1 lf does not evolve at @xmath32 @xcite but significantly declines from @xmath13 to 6.6 @xcite .",
    "the ly@xmath1 lf evolves if laes evolve between @xmath13 and 6.6 .",
    "however , @xcite also confirmed that the rest frame ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum lf of laes does not evolve between @xmath13 and 6.6 , and thus the laes do not significantly evolve over these epochs .",
    "this is because the uv lf of laes can change only if laes evolve in number or luminosity ( e.g. , due to attenuation of their uv continua by dust ) , as the uv continuum is not absorbed by neutral hydrogen . @xcite",
    "performed a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting study of @xmath13 and @xmath14 laes in the samples of @xcite using their multiwavelength data and found that these lae populations on average have negligible dust extinction .",
    "hence , no evolution of uv lf of laes at @xmath136.6 suggests that the decline of the ly@xmath1 lf from @xmath13 to @xmath14 is not due to galaxy evolution but could be attributed to the attenuation of ly@xmath1 emission by neutral hydrogen . comparing the amount of the decline with predictions from various reionization models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "moreover , @xcite found that the rest frame ly@xmath1 equivalent width ( ew@xmath34 ) distributions of @xmath355.7 laes are very similar but ew@xmath34 s of @xmath14 laes are significantly lower .",
    "this also implies that ly@xmath1 emission might be attenuated by neutral hydrogen at @xmath14 . on the other hand",

    "meanwhile , @xcite examined the acf of 207 @xmath14 lae candidates distributed over @xmath37 deg@xmath36 sky area of the subaru/_xmm - newton _ deep survey field ( sxds , * ? ? ? * ) and detected its clustering signal . comparing the acf with the predictions by reionization models @xcite",
    ", they constrained the neutral fraction to be @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , possible increase in neutral fraction at @xmath19 has been also suggested by observations of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "some lbgs are known to exhibit strong ly@xmath1 emission ( ew@xmath39 ) while some others do not .",
    "fraction of ly@xmath1 emitting lbgs increases from @xmath35 to 6 but suddenly decreases from @xmath23 to 78 @xcite .",
    "these studies pointed out that the reversal of the evolution trend at @xmath19 could be due to attenuation of ly@xmath1 emission by neutral hydrogen and rapid evolution of neutral fraction from @xmath23 to 7 .",
    "meanwhile , to investigate the possibility of incomplete reionization at @xmath0 ( hereafter we simply say @xmath40 ) , we also conducted subaru telescope suprime - cam @xcite and the narrowband nb973 ( @xmath9 , @xmath41 , @xmath427.10 , * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure [ filtertransmission ] ) imaging of the sdf and the sxds @xcite .",

    "although our survey limits were shallow and probed only the bright end of the @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lf , we found that the ly@xmath1 lf declines from @xmath14 to @xmath40 more rapidly than it does from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , and neutral fraction could be higher at @xmath40 than @xmath14 ; @xmath480.64 and @xmath49 in sdf and sxds , respectively .",
    "this trend of more rapid or `` accelerated '' decline of ly@xmath1 lf ( and thus possible accelerated increase in neutral fraction ) at higher redshift was also confirmed by @xcite at slightly higher redshift and to deeper survey limits .",
    "they used subaru suprime - cam and the narrowband filter nb101 ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , see figure [ filtertransmission ] ) to detect three and four @xmath18 lae candidates reaching @xmath53 erg s@xmath3 and @xmath54 erg s@xmath3 in sxds and the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos , * ? ? ? * ) fields .",
    "they confirmed that the ly@xmath1 lf of laes declines from @xmath14 to 7.3 more rapidly than it does from @xmath13 to 6.6 .",
    "@xcite also compared the redshift evolution of the ly@xmath1 luminosity density of laes ( @xmath55 ) over @xmath137.3 with that of the uv continuum luminosity density of lbgs ( @xmath56 ) over @xmath2310 and found that @xmath55 modestly decreases from @xmath13 to @xmath14 and sharply decreases from @xmath14 to @xmath18 while @xmath56 modestly decreases from @xmath23 to @xmath57 and sharply decreases from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "based on this result , they claimed that the sharp ( accelerating ) decrease in @xmath55 at @xmath59 is not due to galaxy ( lae ) evolution but could be attributed to attenuation of ly@xmath1 emission of laes by neutral hydrogen .    it should be noted that this conclusion assumes that evolution of laes and lbgs are the same at @xmath2310 . despite some overlaps , they are two different galaxy populations selected by different photometric methods .",
    "laes are selected by detecting their ly@xmath1 emission using a combination of narrowband and broadband filters and thus tend to be bright in ly@xmath1 emission but faint in uv continuum while lbgs are selected by detecting their uv continua using broadband filters and thus inclined to be bright in uv continuum but not necessarily bright in ly@xmath1 .",
    "also , while high redshift ( e.g. , @xmath606.6 ) laes have almost negligible dust extinction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some lbgs suffer significant dust attenuation in their uv continua ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the evolution of laes and lbgs may not necessarily be the same at @xmath2310 , and thus the evolution of @xmath56 at @xmath2310 might not reflect that of the uv continuum luminosity density of laes ( @xmath61 ) at those epochs . to examine",

    ". now we have deep @xmath11 band data , we consider using @xmath95 as well as @xmath96 and/or @xmath102 colors for the lae selection . in order to determine these color criteria , we examined expected colors of laes .",
    "figure [ color_vs_redshift ] shows @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath102 colors as a function of redshift of model laes as well as other types of galaxies and m / l / t type dwarf stars , which may be potential contaminants .",
    "we created model spectra of laes by assuming the power - law continuum @xmath103 with several different uv continuum slopes @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and 0 and adding them the ly@xmath1 emission with rest - frame equivalent width of ew@xmath107 ( no emission ) , 20 , 50 , 150 and 300 .",
    "we did not assume any specific line profile or velocity dispersion of ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "instead , we simply added the total line flux value to the spectra at 1216 .",
    "then , we redshifted the spectra to @xmath1088 and applied igm absorption to them by using the prescription of @xcite .",
    "colors of these model laes were calculated using their redshifted spectra and response curves of the suprime - cam @xmath67 , @xmath11 and nb973 filters .",
    "while we assumed the uv continuum slopes @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and 0 to cover the possible variety of laes and check their expected colors , it would be worth noting that @xcite found @xmath109 for @xmath60 and @xmath110 laes by performing an sed - fitting study .",
    "we show colors of the model laes with @xmath104 for example in figure [ color_vs_redshift ] .    for comparison",
    ", we also calculated the colors of e ( elliptical ) , sbc , scd and i m ( irregular ) galaxies by using the filter response curves and the @xcite template spectra and also plot them in figure [ color_vs_redshift ] .",
    "moreover , we plot the colors of m / l / t type dwarf stars ( specifically , types m3m9.5 , l0l9.5 and t0t8 ) , which can be interlopers , in figure [ color_vs_redshift ] .",
    "we calculated the colors by using the filter response curves and their actual spectra provided by @xcite and @xcite at the spex prism spectral libraries .",
    "as seen in the color - redshift diagrams , @xmath92 laes are expected to show very red colors of @xmath111 , strong narrowband excess of @xmath112 but possibly either modest narrowband excess of @xmath113 or even depression of @xmath114 to @xmath106 .",
    "hence , at this stage we adopt @xmath115 and @xmath116 colors as parts of our @xmath40 lae selection criteria rather than @xmath102 color .",
    "figure [ color_vs_redshift ] shows that low redshift galaxies are expected to be removed by these color criteria . on the other hand , by imposing these color criteria alone , we can not completely eliminate t dwarfs as some of them exhibit colors of @xmath1171.8 and @xmath1181.3 .",
    "however , by imposing null detections in wavebands bluewards of @xmath92 ly@xmath1 ( i.e. , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath66 , nb816 and nb921 ) where fluxes of an lae are absorbed by igm , we could effectively remove dwarfs .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite selected 58 @xmath110 and 89 @xmath60 lae candidates by using the suprime - cam filters and the color criteria analogous to ours and imposing null detections in wavebands bluewards of ly@xmath1 ( less than @xmath99 in @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 for @xmath60 laes ; less than @xmath121 in @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 for @xmath110 laes ) .",
    "@xcite conducted spectroscopy of 66 out of 89 @xmath60 lae candidates and 52 out of 58 @xmath110 lae candidates in their studies and detected no dwarf stars .",
    "hence , we expect that contamination of our sample by dwarfs would be very low or could be zero",
    ". moreover , in section [ lyafaintobjects ] we will show that the contamination from t - type dwarfs can be negligible by further adopting an additional color criterion @xmath124 .",
    "meanwhile , another source of contamination is lower redshift laes and lbgs with ew@xmath125 at @xmath126 which could have @xmath115 and @xmath116 colors as seen in figure [ color_vs_redshift ] .",
    "note that bandpasses of the nb973 and @xmath11 bands overlap with the wavelength range at the red edge of the @xmath67 band as seen in figure [ filtertransmission ] .",
    "this could cause laes and lbgs at @xmath126 to exhibit @xmath115 and @xmath116 colors , if such galaxies have bright and steep uv continua .",
    "for example , @xcite found that a @xmath14 lae detected in nb921 by @xcite and spectroscopically identified by @xcite actually satisfied the color criterion @xmath127 ( see figure 3 and table 1 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hence , the null detection in nb921 band , also previously adopted by @xcite , is important to remove such lower redshift laes from the @xmath40 lae selection .",
    "however , the rate of such contamination seems to be very low or zero .",
    "we examined @xmath128 and @xmath129 colors and nb973 magnitudes of the 58 photometric @xmath110 lae candidates in sdf ( the sample of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we found that 7 out of them are detected in nb973 @xmath130 ( @xmath131 limiting magnitude in sdf which is deeper than that in sxds ) , of which only one satisfies @xmath127 and none meets @xmath132 .",
    "eventually , we used the following criteria ( all the magnitudes are measured in a @xmath100 aperture ) to select @xmath40 lae candidates . @xmath133,\\nonumber\\\\",

    "the @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the @xmath99 limiting magnitudes in @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath66 , nb816 , nb921 and @xmath67 . as the fluxes of laes bluewards of the @xmath92 ly@xmath1 emission",
    "are absorbed by igm , we impose null detections ( fainter than @xmath99 limiting magnitudes ) in @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath66 , nb816 and nb921 bands .",
    "these criteria help remove contamination from dwarf stars and low redshift interlopers including laes / lbgs at @xmath1446.8 as discussed above .",
    "figure [ color_vs_redshift ] shows that the criterion @xmath116 corresponds to the rest frame ly@xmath1 ew threshold of ew@xmath145 and can also detect @xmath92 lbgs with a zero or extremely weak ly@xmath1 emission ( ew@xmath14610 ) as contaminants .",
    "however , as described in section [ lyafaintobjects ] , we can remove such interlopers by estimating their ew@xmath34 s by using their nb973 and @xmath11-band total magnitudes and the equation ( [ eqn_lyauvlum ] ) .    to select @xmath40 lae candidates in the sdf and sxds fields",
    ", we first masked blooming , smearing and halos of large bright stars , large galaxies , bad pixels and low s / n edge regions in the sdf and sxds images by applying the public sdf and sxds masking programs @xcite to our nb973-detected object catalogs made in section [ photometry ] .",
    "then , we further applied the criteria ( [ criteria-1 ] ) to the nb973-detected object catalogs .",
    "in this process , if @xmath67 band magnitude of a source in the catalog are fainter than @xmath147 ( i.e. , @xmath148 ) , we replaced them by @xmath149 .",
    "we found that the criteria ( [ criteria-1 ] ) yielded a large number of objects , and most of them are located in the low s / n regions near the edges of the sdf and sxds nb973 images which arose from the dithering at the time of observations and fringing peculiar to these images and were thus not masked by the public masking program .",
    "this implies that most of them could be noises that appear only in the nb973 images and not in the other wavebands . to examine",
    "if they are noises , we created the negative nb973 images by multiplying each pixel value by @xmath106 , performed source detection running sextractor and limit the detected objects to nb973 @xmath134 .",
    "the low s / n edge regions of the nb973 images where a large number of sources passed the criteria ( [ criteria-1 ] ) was dominated with negative detections , which are considered noises . hence , we removed the sources at these edge regions from the lists of objects that passed the lae criteria ( [ criteria-1 ] ) .",
    "this left 25 and 14 objects in sdf and sxds , respectively .    to further eliminate possible spurious sources ,",

    "we especially removed obviously spurious sources such as columns of bad pixels , pixels saturated with bright stars , their blooming , smearing and halos ( those not removed by the previous masking process ) , noise events of deformed shapes , and scattering pixels having anomalously large fluxes . also , we removed objects seen very faintly in @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath66 , nb816 and nb921 bands ( i.e. , wavebands bluewards of @xmath92 ly@xmath1 ) even though we imposed less than @xmath99 criterion on these bands as a part of the lae selection criteria ( [ criteria-1 ] ) . after the visual inspection ,",
    "we were left with 18 and 6 sources in sdf and sxds , respectively .    in section [ lyafaintobjects ]",

    ". however , their @xmath100 aperture @xmath11 band magnitudes measured by the sextractor double image photometry with the nb973 and the @xmath11-band images are @xmath165 significance ( @xmath166 in nb973-sdf-137578 and @xmath167 in nb973-sxds - c-66280 ) .",
    "hence , we applied the aperture correction of @xmath168 mag to their @xmath100 aperture @xmath11 band magnitudes to estimate their total @xmath11 band magnitudes .",
    "we obtained this correction factor by measuring the differences between total @xmath11-band magnitudes ( either mag_auto or multi - aperture photometry ) and @xmath100 aperture @xmath11-band magnitudes of the 8 unblended lae candidates detected by the @xmath11-band single image photometry and taking their median value . in the process of our lae candidate selection , we masked blooming , smearing and halos of large bright stars , large galaxies and bad pixels as well as removed noise sources at the low s / n edge regions of the nb973 images ( see the grey shaded regions of figures [ sdf_skydist ] and [ sxds_skydist ] for the cases of sdf and sxds , respectively ) .",
    "as a result , total effective areas of the sdf and sxds images used to select @xmath40 lae candidates are 824 and 851 arcmin@xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the comoving distance along the line of sight corresponding to the redshift range @xmath169 for laes covered by nb973 filter is 58 mpc .",
    "therefore , we have probed comoving volumes of @xmath170 mpc@xmath7 and @xmath171 mpc@xmath7 in sdf and sxds , respectively , for our @xmath92 lae selection .",
    "what fraction of real objects in an image we can reliably detect by photometry depends on the magnitudes and blending of objects .",
    "the fraction usually decreases as magnitude becomes fainter due to difficulty in detecting fainter objects .",
    "also , the detectability of target objects is affected by their blending with neighboring objects in projection . to examine what fraction of objects in the nb973 images of sdf and sxds",
    "the sextractor can detect or fails to detect to fainter magnitude , we measured the detection completeness of our photometry as it is used to correct the number of detected laes when we derive their number counts , ly@xmath1 lf , uv lf and ly@xmath1 ew distribution .    using the iraf task starlist and considering @xmath40 laes to be point sources , we first created @xmath172 artificial point sources with the same psfs as the real objects and with random but uniform spatial and magnitude distributions , avoiding coordinates in the masked and low s / n edge regions in the nb973 images and ranging from 20 to 27 mag .",
    "we spread them over the nb973 images by using the iraf task mkobject allowing them to blend with themselves and real objects .",
    "then the sextractor was run for source detections in exactly the same way as our actual photometry .",
    "we extracted the input artificial objects from all the detected objects by the corss - identification based on their positions in the nb973 images .",
    "the artificial objects whose differences between their original magnitudes ( those generated by iraf starlist ) and measured magnitudes ( sextractor mag_auto s ) are @xmath173 mag ( @xmath174 ) tend to partly to completely blend with other objects or regions where sky backgrounds were locally oversubtracted , while those with the magnitude difference @xmath175 mag ( @xmath176 ) are either isolated ( @xmath177% ) or slightly blend with other objects ( only @xmath1784% ) , which can be detected and deblended by sextractor .",
    "hence , we define artificial objects with the magnitude difference of @xmath175 mag as detected and derive the completeness per 0.5 mag bin . finally , we calculated the ratio of the number of the detected artificial objects ( in every 0.5 mag bin in mag_auto ) to that of the created ones ( in every 0.5 mag bin in starlist magnitude ) to obtain the detection completeness .",
    "we repeated this procedure ten times and averaged the obtained completeness for each of the sdf and sxds nb973 images .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ nb973completeness ] , which allows us to infer the actual number of @xmath40 laes from their detected number and measured total nb973 magnitudes .",
    "the completeness is @xmath179% and @xmath180% at our lae detection limits of nb973 @xmath181 in sdf and sxds , respectively . in figure [ nc ]",
    ", we plot the number counts of the @xmath40 lae candidates in sdf and sxds corrected and uncorrected for detection completeness .",

    "( 2 ) completeness : our estimate of the nb973 detection completeness considers change in magnitude more than 0.5 mag due to noise and object blending to be a non - detection while @xcite s estimate of the nb921 ( @xmath14 lae ) detection completeness considers such a case to be a detection . hence , our completeness estimate for @xmath40 lae detections is stricter than that for @xmath14 lae detections , resulting in the relatively larger correction of the detected number of @xmath40 laes than that of @xmath14 laes .",
    "( 3 ) located in ionized bubbles : the laes in the two brightest ly@xmath1 luminosity bins of the @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lf are themselves uv - bright laes detected in the uv continuum and/or have a @xmath92 lbg as an immediate neighbor . as such laes and lbgs would be stronger ionizing sources , their surroundings could be largely ionized , allowing higher transmission of ly@xmath1 photons ( see section [ skydist ] and figures [ sdf_skydist ] and [ sxds_skydist ] for more details ) .",
    "the @xmath13 and 6.6 ly@xmath1 lfs compared in figure [ lyalfs_at_z5p7 - 7p3 ] are mostly based on the photometric lae samples with some fraction confirmed by spectroscopy despite their large sample sizes drawn from the large sky area of the entire sxds plus sdf by @xcite .",
    "while these lfs have large advantage in terms of very robust statistics , they might include some degree of contamination .",
    "meanwhile , although limitted to a smaller sky area of only sdf , @xcite carried out extensive spectroscopy campaigns of photometric @xmath13 and 6.6 lae candidates and identified 54 ( 45 ) real @xmath13 ( 6.6 ) laes , which are 70% ( 81% ) of their photometric samples . then , they derived @xmath13 and 6.6 ly@xmath1 lfs based on their samples consisting of the large fractions of spectroscopically confirmed laes and small fractions of remaining photometric candidates . while these lfs have disadvantage in statistics compared to the lfs from @xcite , they suffer significantly less amount of contaminations because of the very large fractions of spectroscopically confirmed laes .",
    "hence , we also compare our @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lf to the @xmath13 and 6.6 ly@xmath1 lfs ( their best - fit schechter functions ) derived by @xcite in figure [ lyalfs_at_z5p7 - 7_in_sdf ] .",

    "eventually , our results suggest that the evolution of the ly@xmath1 lf at the epochs between @xmath13 and 7.3 is not always solely due to the change in luminosity of laes .",
    "the number density could also play a role especially at @xmath147 .",

    "the significant and definitive decline of the ly@xmath1 lf from @xmath13 to 7 and possible decline from @xmath14 to 7 at its faint end might be due to the attenuation of ly@xmath1 emission of laes by higher fraction of neutral igm at higher redshifts during the epoch of reionization .",
    "however , these declines can be also ascribed to the change in the detectability of laes due to galaxy evolution ( their number and/or luminosity evolution ) .",
    "hence , the decline of the ly@xmath1 lf can be caused by either igm attenuation of ly@xmath1 alone , galaxy evolution alone or combination of the both .",
    "we can disentangle these if we can extract the galaxy evolution fraction alone contributing to the decline of the ly@xmath1 lf .",
    "the rest frame uv continuum lf ( uv lf ) of laes can be used as a probe of evolution of laes because of the following reason . if there is no galaxy evolution ( in both number and luminosity ) between two epochs @xmath331 and @xmath19 , the ly@xmath1 lf would shift to the fainter ly@xmath1 luminosity side from @xmath331 to @xmath19 if ly@xmath1 emissions of laes are attenuated by neutral igm at @xmath19 .",
    "uv - bright laes emitting stronger ionizing radiation can effectively ionize their surroundings , and thus their ly@xmath1 emissions are less attenuated by neutral igm .",
    "conversely , uv - faint laes emitting weaker ionizing radiation can not effectively ionize their surroundings , and thus their ly@xmath1 emissions are more attenuated by neutral igm . therefore ,",
    "only laes faint in both ly@xmath1 and the uv continuum around the faint end of the ly@xmath1 lf get fainter than a survey s ly@xmath1 luminosity limit at @xmath19 and would not be detected by a narrowband observation .",
    "accordingly , the detection number of such laes is expected to decrease . meanwhile , even in such a situation , the uv lf of laes will not shift to the fainter luminosity side as the rest frame uv continua of laes are not attenuated by neutral igm at @xmath19 .",
    "however , the number density of laes is expected to decrease only at the faint end of the uv lf due to the decrease in the detection number of laes faint in both ly@xmath1 and the uv continuum in the narrowband observation mentioned above . hence ,",
    "unless there is galaxy evolution , the bright side of the uv lf stays unchanged and only its faint end would change .",
    "this characteristic of the uv lf can be used to see if laes evolve between @xmath331 and @xmath19 .",
    "usually , we can not accurately determine the faint end of the uv lf of laes to a sufficiently faint uv luminosity limit with high completeness due to the faintness of the uv continua of uv - faint laes and the difficulty in obtaining extremely deep imaging covering their uv - continua ( especially for @xmath137 laes ) .",
    "thus , we inevitably compare only the bright sides of the uv lfs of laes at @xmath331 and @xmath19 .",
    "previously , @xcite estimated the uv continuum fluxes @xmath202 and then luminosities @xmath215 of @xmath13 and 6.6 laes in sdf using their narrowband ( nb816 and nb921 bands ) and broadband ( @xmath67 band ) magnitudes and the equation ( [ eqn_lyauvlum ] ) and derived the uv lfs of @xmath13 and 6.6 laes .",
    "they found that the lae uv lf does not evolve much between @xmath13 and 6.6 , suggesting no significant evolution of laes during this cosmic time interval .",
    "as we have also already estimated the @xmath215 of our @xmath40 lae candidates in section [ lyauvlumsfrlimit ] and table [ propertyz7laecandidates ] using their nb973 and @xmath11 band total magnitudes and the equation ( [ eqn_lyauvlum ] ) in the same way as @xcite , we also derive the uv lf of the @xmath40 lae candidates and compare it to those at @xmath13 and 6.6 derived by @xcite . to this end , we use only the @xmath40 lae candidates in sdf , not including those in sxds , as the @xmath11 band image of the sxds is much shallower than that of the sdf .",
    "we count the number of @xmath40 lae candidates detected in uv continuum ( i.e. , those with @xmath332 ) in each @xmath215 bin , estimate its error including poisson error and cosmic variance and correct the number and error for the detection completeness estimated in section [ completeness ] and shown in figure [ nb973completeness ] by number weighting according to the nb973 magnitude .",
    "then , we divide the corrected numbers and errors by the sdf survey volume to convert them into the number densities .",
    "note that this procedure is the same as the one used by @xcite who corrected the numbers of their @xmath13 and 6.6 laes using their detection completeness in the narrowbands nb816 and nb921 .",
    "it is more ideal to use the detection completeness in the broadband covering the rest frame uv continuum of laes redward of ly@xmath1 ( in the case of our @xmath40 laes , it is @xmath11 band ) .",
    "however , as we and @xcite used the narrwobands as the lae detection images , it is impossible to use the detection completenesses in the broadbands .",
    "thus , we and @xcite instead use the detection completenesses in the narrowbands as good approximation because they can detect not only ly@xmath1 emission but also uv continua of laes at the same time .    in figure",

    "we notice that out of their galaxies , the narrowband - selected @xmath60 and @xmath110 laes have @xmath3330.16 ( 0.06 on average ) and @xmath3370.36 ( 0.15 on average ) , respectively , and iok-1 has @xmath338 .",
    "these sed - fitting studies suggest that amount of dust extinction is very low and similar among @xmath13 , 6.6 and 7 laes although the sample of @xmath92 lae in these studies is small .",
    "hence , the deficit in the @xmath40 lae uv lf compared to @xmath13 and 6.6 ones may not be due to the difference in the amount of dust extinction between laes at these epochs .",
    "whatever the origin of the deficit in the @xmath40 lae uv lf is , it implies that galaxy evolution seems to partially contribute to the deficit in @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lf .",
    "we will discuss this in more details and quantitatively in section 5 when we obtain implications for reionization from the both @xmath40 lae ly@xmath1 and uv lfs .",
    "another method of examining the possible attenuation of ly@xmath1 emission of laes by neutral igm during the reionization epoch is to compare the ly@xmath1 ew distribution of laes at @xmath331 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite found that the rest frame ly@xmath1 ew ( ew@xmath34 ) distributions of @xmath355.7 laes are very similar but ew@xmath34 s of @xmath14 laes are significantly smaller .",
    "this implies that ly@xmath1 emission might be attenuated by neutral igm at @xmath14",
    ". if this is the case , ew@xmath34 s of our @xmath40 laes could be even smaller than those of @xmath14 laes due to the possible stronger suppression of ly@xmath1 emission by the potentially larger neutral igm fraction at higher redshift .    in section [ lyauvlumsfrlimit ] , we derived the ew@xmath34 s ( or lower limits on ew@xmath34 ) of our @xmath40 laes from their ly@xmath1 fluxes @xmath200 and uv continuum fluxes @xmath202 estimated by using the equation ( [ eqn_lyauvlum ] ) and their nb973 and @xmath11-band total magnitudes in the same way as @xcite .",
    "we count the number of @xmath40 laes in each ew@xmath34 bin , correct it for the detection completeness estimated in section [ completeness ] and shown in figure [ nb973completeness ] by number weighting according to the nb973 magnitude and normalize it by the total completeness - corrected number of @xmath40 laes .",
    "this procedure is also the same as the one taken by @xcite .",
    "hence , we can compare the ew@xmath34 distribution of our @xmath40 laes with those of the @xmath13 and 6.6 laes derived by @xcite with less or no bias / systematics .",
    "we make this comparison in figure [ ew_distribution ] .",
    "as @xcite compiled ew@xmath34 s of the @xmath13 and 6.6 laes only in sdf , we also use our @xmath40 laes only in sdf for the derivation of the @xmath40 lae ew@xmath34 distribution .",
    "as seen in table [ laesurveys ] , we compare these @xmath13 , 6.6 and 7 lae samples in sdf to the fairly comparable ew@xmath34 thresholds ( 10 , 7  and 10  for @xmath13 , 6.6 and 7 ) . @xcite estimated the lower limits on ew@xmath34 s of the @xmath13 and 6.6 laes undetected ( @xmath339 ) in @xmath67-band ( i.e. , undetected in uv continuum ) from the @xmath147 magnitude of the @xmath67-band sdf image and included them in the ew@xmath34 bins in the ew@xmath34 distributions of the @xmath13 and 6.6 laes ( the blue and the green bins with an arrow in figure [ ew_distribution ] ) .",
    "hence , for the fair comparison , in the ew@xmath34 bins ( the red bins with an arrow in figure [ ew_distribution ] ) we also include the lower limits on ew@xmath34 s of the @xmath40 laes undetected ( @xmath339 ) in @xmath11-band estimated from the @xmath147 magnitude of the @xmath11-band sdf image ( see table [ propertyz7laecandidates ] and section [ lyauvlumsfrlimit ] for the ew@xmath34 lower limits ) .",
    "the frequencies f of the bins with an arrow in figure [ ew_distribution ] are upper limits as true values of included ew@xmath34 lower limits fall in the same bins or higher ew@xmath34 bins .",
    "figure [ ew_distribution ] shows that the peak of the @xmath40 ew@xmath34 distribution coincides with that of the @xmath13 distribution at the ew@xmath340 80100  bin .",
    "also , the overall distributions look very similar between @xmath40 and @xmath13 .",
    "however , the @xmath40 ew@xmath34 distribution exhibits bimodality with another peak at the 2040  bin .",
    "the three consecutive ( 060 ) bins around this peak consist of ew@xmath34 s of only the @xmath40 laes detected in the uv continuum and do not include any ew@xmath34 lower limits of the laes undetected in the uv continuum .",
    "hence , there is no uncertainty due to including any ew@xmath34 lower limits .",
    "moreover , these three bins comprise two thirds of ( 4 out of the 6 ) @xmath40 laes detected in the uv continuum in sdf .",
    "the ew@xmath34 s of these bins are lower than typical ew@xmath34 s ( and ew@xmath34 s limits ) of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 laes .",
    "hence , there is a possiblity that ly@xmath1 emission of a fraction of @xmath40 laes might be more strongly attenuated by possibly higher fraction of neutral igm at @xmath40 than @xmath13 and @xmath14 although our @xmath40 lae sample size is much smaller than those of the @xmath13 and 6.6 laes .",
    "on the other hand , previous studies found that both @xmath3416.6 laes and @xmath356 lbgs share the same trend in the ew@xmath34uv luminosity relation that there is an apparent deficit of high ly@xmath1 ew galaxies with a bright uv luminosity .",
    "galaxies with a fainter uv continuum tend to exhibit a stronger ly@xmath1 ew @xcite .",
    "this trend has been clearly confirmed by the previous studies in the ew@xmath34@xmath215 relation in such a way that ew@xmath34 systematically decreases as uv luminosity increases . to see",
    "if this also applies to @xmath40 laes , we plot the ew@xmath34@xmath215 diagram of our @xmath40 lae candidates in sdf and sxds in figure [ ew_vs_muv ] .",
    "we find that our @xmath40 lae candidates also lack the high ew bright uv luminosity objects and that those with fainter @xmath215 exhibit higher ews following the same trend as that seen for lower redshift laes and lbgs .",
    "we also plot the objects with an extremely faint or zero ly@xmath1 flux ( @xmath342 ) and @xmath343 color ( likely considered @xmath92 lbgs ; see section [ lyafaintobjects ] and tables [ z7laecandidates ] and [ propertyz7laecandidates ] for their details ) .",
    "they show brighter uv luminosities than @xmath40 laes and located at the low - ew@xmath34 , high-@xmath215 edge of the ew@xmath34@xmath215 trend .    the physical mechanism of the ew@xmath34@xmath215 trend of laes and lbgs has not been fully understood yet , but several studies suggested a few different explanations ; e.g. , higher metallicities in the uv - bright galaxies , older stellar populations in the uv - bright galaxies , enhancement of ews of uv - faint galaxies at a pre - outflow phase by clumpy dust extinction and low ews of low dust uv - bright galaxies at an outflow phase with a long history of starburst since its onset @xcite . whatever the origin would be , the ew@xmath34@xmath215 trend also exists for the galaxies at the epoch as early as @xmath40 .",
    "in the previous sections , we have derived the ly@xmath1 lf , the uv lf and the ew@xmath34 distribution of the @xmath40 laes from our observations .",
    "then , we have found that the ly@xmath1 lf of laes evolves from @xmath13 and 6.6 to 7 and from @xmath40 to 7.3 , that the uv lf of laes evolves from @xmath136.6 to 7 and that most of the ew@xmath34 s of the @xmath40 laes detected in the uv continuum are lower than those of @xmath13 and 6.6 laes .",
    "all these results would suggest that laes themselves do evolve and neutral fraction of igm could also increase from @xmath136.6 to 7 . in this section ,",
    "we further investigate and discuss this by extracting the number and luminosity densities of laes as well as comparing the observation results with theoretical models of galaxy evolution and reionization .",

    "for example , the difference in densities caused by spectroscopy fraction can be seen for the @xmath13 and 6.6 @xmath351 and @xmath352 derived by using the @xcite @xmath13 and 6.6 ly@xmath1 lfs based on large fraction of photometric lae candidates ( the left data points at @xmath13 and 6.6 in figure [ madau_plot ] ) and the @xcite @xmath13 and 6.6 ly@xmath1 lfs based on large fraction of spectroscopically confirmed laes ( the right data points at @xmath13 and 6.6 in figure [ madau_plot ] ) .",

    "on the other hand , the sky distributions of the lae and lbg candidates in sdf and sxds as well as brightness in the uv continuum of the laes could explain the non - evolution of the ly@xmath1 lf between @xmath14 and @xmath40 at the bright end ( the two brightest bins log@xmath221(ly@xmath1 ) @xmath10 43.243.4 and 43.043.2 ) seen in figure [ lyalfs_at_z5p7 - 7p3 ] .",
    "the brightest ly@xmath1 lf bin includes only iok-1 in sdf as seen in figure [ sdf_skydist ] .",
    "iok-1 is detected in the uv continuum and has the brightest uv continuum luminosity of all the uv - continuum - detected lae candidates .",
    "hence , it may be able to effectively ionize its surroundings by itself , and this could reduce the neutral fraction locally , allow the higher transmission of its ly@xmath1 photons and make iok-1 very bright in ly@xmath1 emission , too .",
    "meanwhile , the second brightest ly@xmath1 lf bin contains two laes in sdf and two laes in sxds as seen in figures [ sdf_skydist ] and [ sxds_skydist ] .",
    "the one in sdf and the two in sxds are detected in the uv continuum and thus uv - bright galaxies that could ionize their surroundings by themselves .",
    "the remaining one lae in sdf is not detected in the uv continuum and hence a uv - faint galaxy that might not be able to ionize its surroundings well .",
    "however , as seen in figure [ sdf_skydist ] , there is a @xmath92 lbg candidate very close ( within @xmath537 comoving mpc ) to this lae candidates .",
    "this lbg could ionize the neutral igm around the lae .",
    "all these situations may allow the locally higher transmission of ly@xmath1 photons from these four laes in sdf and sxds , making them bright in ly@xmath1 emission . as a result ,",
    "the two brightest ly@xmath1 lf bins include ly@xmath1-bright laes and could contribute to the apparent non - evolution of the ly@xmath1 lf between @xmath14 and @xmath40 at the bright end in possible conspiracy with the field - to - field variance of the number of laes and the difference in the method of estimating the narrowband detection completeness between our and previous lae studies discussed earlier .",
    "we carried out very deep subaru suprime - cam nb973 imaging of sdf and sxds to conduct a census of @xmath40 laes to the ly@xmath1 luminosity limit as comparable as possible to the depths of the previous subaru surveys of laes at @xmath13 , 6.6 and 7.3 and to investigate the @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lf to its faint end .",
    "our observations led to the ly@xmath1 flux limits of @xmath219(ly@xmath1)@xmath227 and @xmath228 erg s@xmath3 cm@xmath98 ( @xmath131 ) or the ly@xmath1 luminosity limits of @xmath221(ly@xmath1)@xmath229 and @xmath230 erg s@xmath3 ( @xmath131 ) for sdf and sxds , respectively .",
    "these limits correspond to 0.220.36 @xmath5 ( sdf ) and 0.290.49 @xmath5 ( sxds ) and probe the @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lf to its fainter end . the @xmath5 are derived by fitting the schechter function to the @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lfs ( see below ) .",
    "we also newly obtained fairly deep suprime - cam @xmath11-band imaging of sxds and the very deep @xmath11-band image of sdf ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and our observations ) .",
    "the @xmath11-band covers both @xmath40 ly@xmath1 emission and the rest frame uv continuum redward of it .",
    "hence , we simulate the colors of @xmath40 laes including the @xmath11-band and established a new robust color selection criteria of them .",
    "application of the criteria to our photometric catalog led to the detections of 14 and 6 @xmath40 lae candidates ( including one @xmath151 lae previously spectroscopically confirmed ) in sdf and sxds , respectively .",
    "this is considerably smaller number than the 89 @xmath13 and 58 @xmath14 lae photometric candidates previously detected in sdf to the comparable depths but 1.7 ( @xmath538 and 1.4 ( @xmath14 ) times smaller survey volumes with subaru suprime - cam @xcite . using nb973 and @xmath11-band magnitudes ( or limits ) of the @xmath40 lae candidates , we estimate their ly@xmath1 fluxes , luminosities and ews as well as uv continuum magnitudes , fluxes and luminosities .",
    "then , we derive the ly@xmath1 and uv lfs and ew distribution of the @xmath40 lae candidates .",
    "we summarize main results of our study below .    1 .",
    "we derive both differential and cumulative @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lfs to facilitate the comparison with the @xmath13 , 6.6 and 7.3 ly@xmath1 lfs derived differentially or cumulatively by the previous subaru lae studies .",
    "we do not detect any @xmath40 lae candidates at the ly@xmath1 luminositiy ranges of @xmath264 ( erg s@xmath3 ) = 42.342.6 in sdf and 42.4342.8 in sxds although these luminosity ranges are close to but still within our survey limits . though actual sensitivities could be somewhat shallower than our estimates",
    ", it is also possible that the very faint end of the @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lf might be suppressed as ly@xmath1 emissions of fainter laes are more preferentially attenuated by neutral igm as suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , we can not distinguish between these two possibilities from the current data alone .",
    "hence , we derive the two different cumulative ly@xmath1 lfs of @xmath40 laes : ( 1 ) the lf excluding the faintest ly@xmath1 luminositiy bins within our survey limits where no lae candidate is detected and ( 2 ) the lf including these faintest bins .",
    "we compare the differential ly@xmath1 lf of our @xmath40 lae candidates to those of laes at @xmath13 , 6.6 and 7.3 in sxds and cosmos fields mostly based on photometric lae candidates derived from the previous subaru suprime - cam lae surveys conducted by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lf exhibits a significant deficit from the @xmath13 one from the bright to faint end .",
    "also , @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lf shows a significant deficit from the @xmath14 one at the fainter end @xmath264 ( erg s@xmath3 ) @xmath539 and the both lfs are almost same at the bright end @xmath264 ( erg s@xmath3 ) @xmath540 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath18 ly@xmath1 lf shows a significant deficit from our @xmath40 lf .",
    "we also compare the two cumulative ly@xmath1 lfs of our @xmath40 lae candidates to those of laes at @xmath13 and 6.6 in sdf mostly based on spectroscopically confirmed laes derived by the @xcite .",
    "their laes were also originally detected by using subaru suprime - cam .",
    "both cumulative @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lfs show significant deficits from the @xmath13 lf from bright to faint end . on the other hand , the cumulative @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lf excluding the faintest bins does not exhibit any deficit from the @xmath14 lf .",
    "however , the cumulative @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lf including the faintest bins shows a deficit from the @xmath14 lf at the faint end @xmath264 ( erg s@xmath3 ) @xmath541 .",
    "we fit the schechter function to our @xmath40 lae ly@xmath1 lfs fixing the slope to @xmath268 ( to facilitate the comparison with previous lae studies ) and derive their characteristic luminosities and number densities , @xmath266 and @xmath267 .",
    "also , we fit the schechter functions with their @xmath266 or @xmath267 fixed to those of the @xmath13 or 6.6 ly@xmath1 lf to our @xmath40 lae ly@xmath1 lfs in order to see which of the luminosity evolution or the number evolution is more dominant factor in the evolution of the ly@xmath1 lf at @xmath137 and @xmath147 . we find that the number evolution is more dominant .",
    "combining these results with the @xmath266 and @xmath267 evolutions at @xmath136.6 and @xmath407.3 derived from similar schechter function fittings , we estimate the rates of decrease in @xmath266 and @xmath267 ( @xmath325 and @xmath326 ) at the redshift ranges of @xmath136.6 ( @xmath542 gyr ) , 6.67 ( @xmath543 gyr ) and 77.3 ( @xmath544 gyr ) in the cases of the pure luminosity and pure number evolutions . we find that @xmath266 and @xmath267 decrease acceleratingly as redshift increases .",
    "meanwhile , we compare the uv lf of our @xmath40 lae candidates in sdf with those of the @xmath13 and 6.6 laes in sdf derived by the same method by @xcite .",
    "@xcite already found that the uv lf does not evolve much between @xmath13 and 6.6 .",
    "we newly find that the @xmath40 lae uv lf shows a deficit from @xmath13 and 6.6 ones although these three lfs are consistent within statistical errors and cosmic variance .",
    "this implies that laes evolve between @xmath14 and 7 , and this partially contribute to the decline of the ly@xmath1 lf from @xmath14 to 7 .",
    "we also compare the rest frame ly@xmath1 ew ( ew@xmath34 ) distribution of our @xmath40 lae candidates in sdf with those of the @xmath13 and 6.6 laes in sdf derived by the same method by @xcite .",
    "@xcite already found that the ew@xmath34 s of the @xmath14 laes are systematically lower than those of the @xmath13 laes .",
    "we further find that two thirds of our @xmath40 lae candidates detected in the uv continuum exhibit ew@xmath34 s lower than those of @xmath14 laes .",
    "this implies that ly@xmath1 emission of laes could be more strongly suppressed at @xmath40 than @xmath14 by possibly higher fraction of neutral igm at @xmath40 .",
    "7 .   furthermore , we combine the number , ly@xmath1 luminosity , uv luminosity densities ( @xmath545 , @xmath546 , @xmath547 and @xmath493 ) of our @xmath40 laes with those of the @xmath341 , 3.7 , 4.5 , 5.7 , 6.6 and 7.3 laes calculated by integrating the ly@xmath1 and uv lfs to @xmath264 ( erg s@xmath3 ) @xmath10 42.4 and @xmath357 mag to trace the redshift evolution of these densities which could reflect the change in neutral igm fraction with redshift .",
    "we find that the @xmath545 and @xmath547 do not change much at @xmath3415.7 but modestly decrease at @xmath136.6 , slightly more rapidly decrease at @xmath147 and more rapidly decrease at @xmath407.3 .",
    "meanwhile , the @xmath546 and @xmath493 increase at @xmath3415.7 , very modestly increase or stay constant at @xmath136.6 and decrease at @xmath147 .",
    "moreover , we estimate the rate of decrease in the densities ( @xmath548 , @xmath549 , @xmath550 and @xmath551 ) at the redshift ranges @xmath136.6 , 6.67 , and 77.3 .",
    "we find that @xmath548 and @xmath550 get higher as redshift increases , implying accelerating decrease in @xmath545 and @xmath547 at @xmath15 . also , @xmath549 and @xmath551 are comparable to or even higher than @xmath548 and @xmath550 .",
    "all these results imply that neutral igm faction could acceleratingly get higher at @xmath15 and suppress ly@xmath1 emission of laes while laes evolve between @xmath14 and 7 , partially contributing to the decrease in @xmath545 and @xmath547 from @xmath14 to 7 .",
    "we also compare our three types of observed @xmath40 lae ly@xmath1 lf ( one differential lf and two cumulative lfs ; see above ) with the @xmath13 and @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lfs theoretically predicted by the ktn10 lae evolution model .",
    "although the ktn10 @xmath40 lf already includes effect of the lae evolution from the ktn10 @xmath13 lf matched to the observed @xmath13 lf , our observed @xmath40 lfs show a significant deficit from the ktn10 @xmath40 lf .",
    "this discrepancy can be reconciled if we attenuate the ly@xmath1 luminosities of the ktn10 @xmath40 lf by a factor of 0.60.7 .",
    "this factor corresponds to the upper limit on the igm transmission of ly@xmath1 photons at @xmath40 , @xmath5130.7 as the ly@xmath1 lf is based on photometric lae candidates that may include some contaminations .",
    "we also independently estimate this factor to be 0.67 by using the @xmath547 and @xmath493 of laes at @xmath40 and 5.7 and the equation ( [ eqn_tlya ] ) .",
    "we convert @xmath515 into the neutral igm fraction at @xmath40 , @xmath516 by using several different reionization models .",
    "we obtain @xmath529 , suggesting that reionization was not complete at @xmath40 . our result combined with estimates of @xmath27 from previous studies of laes at other epochs , qsos , grbs and",
    "lbg ly@xmath1 fraction also suggests that @xmath27 increases rapidly from @xmath531 to @xmath532 at @xmath238 .",
    "this is consistent with the most recent constraint on reionization history from the planck 2016 cmb observations intermediate results as well as the contribution from star - forming galaxies derived by the @xcite model and the cosmic ionizing emissivity by the @xcite model .",
    "finally , we examine the sky distribution of our @xmath40 lae candidates in sdf and sxds .",
    "we find that laes near ionizing sources ( either uv - bright laes or lbgs ) within typical ionized bubbles ( @xmath552 comoving mpc at @xmath40 ) and/or the uv - bright laes that are themselves moderate ionizing sources would be preferentially seen by our narrowband nb973 observations .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that the sky distribution is just the product of chance .",
    "meanwhile , the sky distributions of the lae and lbg candidates in sdf and sxds as well as brightness in the uv continuum of the laes could also explain the non - evolution of the ly@xmath1 lf between @xmath14 and @xmath40 at the bright end ( the two brightest bins log@xmath221(ly@xmath1 ) @xmath10 43.243.4 and 43.043.2 ) .",
    "these bins contain four uv - bright laes that could effectively ionize their surroundings by themselves and one uv - faint lae that might not be able to ionize its surroundings well but has a uv - bright lbg candidate as an immediate neighbor that could instead ionize the lae s surroundings .",
    "these situations could allow the locally higher transmission of ly@xmath1 photons from these five laes , making them bright enough in ly@xmath1 emission to form the brightest @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lf bins that apparently show no evolution from @xmath14 .",
    "again , the possible field - to - field variance of the number of laes and the difference in the method of estimating the narrowband detection completeness between our and previous lae studies could also partly contribute to this non - evolution of the ly@xmath1 lf at the bright end .",
    "the present study is based on our @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lf consisting of the photometric @xmath40 lae candidates ( except for one @xmath151 lae spectroscopically confirmed ) .",
    "if the candidates include some contaminations , the actual deficit in the @xmath40 ly@xmath1 lf from @xmath13 and 6.6 are more significant and the estimated neutral igm fraction at @xmath40 will be higher . to confirm this , the follow - up spectroscopy of all the @xmath40 lae candidates is essential as a next step . also , this study is the last one of the series of the subaru suprime - cam narrowband lae surveys in sdf and sxds .",
    "these lae surveys have successfully revealed galaxy evolution and cosmic reionization at @xmath137.3 taking full advantage of the large field - of - view ( fov ) and the fully depleted red - sensitive ccds of the suprime - cam . currently , the strategic survey program of the hyper suprime - cam ( hsc ) , which has a seven times larger fov , is now in progress by investing 300 nights of subaru time for five years .",
    "these observations include the narrowband imagings targeting @xmath137.3 laes and will significantly improve the statistics of the lae studies .",
    "this will enable to obtain more robust constraints on the reionization state .",
    "we are grateful to the staff at the subaru telescope for their great support during our observations .",
    "we thank masami ouchi for providing his ly@xmath1 lf data and sdf @xmath11-band image and for useful discussion , tomoe takeuchi and hiroko tamazawa for helping us conduct parts of our observations , tomoki morokuma and linhua jiang for providing the deep @xmath64 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 images of the sdf , tadayuki kodama and ken - ichi tadaki for providing the information about their @xmath11-band imaging observations of sxds .",

    "<S> we conduct a census of 20 @xmath0 ly@xmath1 emitters ( laes ) detected in the subaru deep field ( sdf ) and the subaru/_xmm - newton _ deep survey ( sxds ) field to a ly@xmath1 luminosity limit @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 or @xmath4 @xmath5 and in a volume @xmath6 mpc@xmath7 achieved by our @xmath8 and 37 hrs of subaru telescope suprime - cam narrowband nb973 ( @xmath9 , fwhm @xmath10 200 ) and reddest optical @xmath11-band imagings . </S>",
    "<S> our survey @xmath12 limit is comparable to those of the previous suprime - cam @xmath13 , 6.6 and 7.3 lae surveys and probes the @xmath0 ly@xmath1 luminosity function ( lf ) to its fainter end . </S>",
    "<S> we derive ly@xmath1 lf , rest frame uv lf , ly@xmath1 equivalent width ( ew ) distribution of our @xmath0 laes and compare them to those of @xmath13 , 6.6 and 7.3 laes . </S>",
    "<S> the ly@xmath1 lf significantly declines from @xmath13 to 7.0 at the bright to faint end and from @xmath14 to 7.0 at the faint end . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the ly@xmath1 lf more significantly declines from @xmath0 to 7.3 . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , though the uv lf of laes does not evolve much at @xmath136.6 , it modestly declines from @xmath136.6 to 7.0 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in addition to the systematic decrease in ly@xmath1 ew distribution from @xmath13 to 6.6 previously found , we newly find that 2/3 of our @xmath0 laes detected in the uv continuum have lower ews than those of the @xmath14 laes . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm that the ly@xmath1 luminosity density of laes decreases mildly at @xmath136.6 , slightly more rapidly at @xmath147.0 and even more rapidly at @xmath07.3 , while the uv luminosity density of laes stays almost constant at @xmath136.6 and modestly decreases at @xmath147.0 . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that ly@xmath1 lf and density acceleratingly decrease at @xmath15 as suggested by previous studies , and the declines of the uv lf and density at @xmath147.0 suggest that galaxy evolution contributes to some extent to the declines of the ly@xmath1 lf , ews and luminosity density at this epoch </S>",
    "<S> . comparison of our @xmath0 ly@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> lf to the one predicted by a recent lae evolution model further reveals that galaxy evolution alone can not explain all the decline of the ly@xmath1 lf at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> if we attribute the discrepancy to ly@xmath1 attenuation by neutral hydrogen , the intergalactic medium transmission of ly@xmath1 photons at @xmath0 would be @xmath160.7 . </S>",
    "<S> it is lower ( higher ) than @xmath17 at @xmath14 ( @xmath18 ) derived by previous studies , suggesting that neutral fraction increases with redshift at @xmath19 . </S>"
