    "with advances in technology , it will become indispensable to determine numerous relativistic effects in the propagation of light beyond the first order in the newtonian gravitational constant @xmath0 , in particular in the area of space astrometry .",
    "the global astrometric interferometer for astrophysics ( gaia , perryman _",
    "2001 ) is already planned to measure the positions and/or the parallaxes of celestial objects with typical uncertainties in the range 1 - 10 @xmath1arcsecond ( @xmath1as ) whereas the laser astrometric test of relativity ( lator ) mission will measure the bending of light near the sun to an accuracy of 0.02 @xmath1as ( turyshev _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) . in this last case , it is clear that the effects of the second order in @xmath0 must be taken into account . to obtain a modelling of the above - mentioned projects , it is necesssary to determine the deflection of light rays between two points @xmath2 and @xmath3 of space - time . in almost all of the theoretical studies devoted to this problem ,",
    "the properties of light rays are determined by integrating the differential equations of the null geodesics .",
    "this procedure is workable as long as one contents oneself with analyzing the effects of first order in @xmath0 , as it is proven by the generality of the results obtained in the litterature ( klioner 1991 , klioner & kopeikin 1992 , kopeikin 1997 , kopeikin & schfer 1999 , kopeikin & mashhoon 2002 , klioner 2003 ) .",
    "unfortunately , analytical solution of the geodesic equations requires cumbersome calculations when terms of second order in @xmath0 are taken into account , even in the case of a static , spherically symmetric space - time ( richter & matzner 1982 , 1983 ) . however , an alternative approach exists and seems to be promising .",
    "based on the synge s world function and variational properties of geodesic , it precisely does not require the knowledge of the geodesic and directly provides the time delay of light and the direction of a ray at the point of reception , i.e. at the observation point .",
    "in this work we derive the general expression of the angular separation between two point light sources as measured by a given observer in arbitrary motion .",
    "we show that the angular distance is fully determined if we calculate several ratios which can be obtained from the knowledge of the synge s world function .    throughout this paper , @xmath4 is the speed of light in a vacuum and @xmath0 is the newtonian gravitational constant .",
    "the lorentzian metric of space - time @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "we adopt the signature @xmath7 .",
    "we suppose that space - time is covered by some global coordinate system @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the curves of equations @xmath9 const are timelike in the neighbourhood of the observer .",
    "this condition means that @xmath10 in the vicinity of the observer .",
    "we employ the vector notation @xmath11 in order to denote either the ordered set @xmath12 , or the orderer set @xmath13 .",
    "given @xmath14 , for instance , @xmath15 denotes @xmath16 if @xmath17 and @xmath18 if @xmath19 ) , the einstein convention of summation on repeated indices being used in each case . the quantity @xmath20 denotes the ordinary euclidean norm of @xmath11 : @xmath21 if @xmath14 , and @xmath22 if @xmath23 .",
    "the indices in parentheses characterize the order of a term in a perturbative expansion .",
    "theses indices are set up or down , depending on the convenience .",
    "to begin with , let us consider a light ray @xmath24 received at point @xmath25 and let us recall how is defined the direction of this ray as measured by an observer @xmath26 moving at @xmath27 with a unit 4-velocity @xmath28 .",
    "the three - space relative to the observer @xmath26 at point @xmath27 is the subspace @xmath29 of tangent vectors orthogonal to @xmath28 ( see figure below ) .    , width=510 ]    an arbitrary vector @xmath30 at @xmath27 admits one and only one decomposition of the form v = v__u + v__u , where @xmath31 is colinear to the unit vector @xmath28 and @xmath32 is a vector of the three - space @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath32 and @xmath28 are orthogonal , one has v__u = ( u .",
    "v ) u and v__u = v - ( u .",
    "v ) u . the vector @xmath32 is called the ( orthogonal ) projection of @xmath30 onto the three - space relative to the observer @xmath26 .",
    "its magnitude @xmath33 is given by v__u= .",
    "the direction of vector @xmath30 as seen by the observer @xmath26 is the direction of the unit spacelike vector @xmath34 defined as v__u^ = = .",
    "consider now a light ray @xmath24 received at @xmath27 and denote by @xmath35 a vector tangent to @xmath24 at @xmath27 . in this work",
    ", we always assume that a vector tangent to a light ray is a null vector and is future oriented , so that l^2 = 0 , u.l > 0 .",
    "the direction of the ray @xmath24 as measured by the observer @xmath26 is the direction of the vector @xmath36 . by using eq .",
    "( [ di1 ] ) , and then taking into account eqs .",
    "( [ nul ] ) , it is easy to see that l__u^ = - u .",
    "let @xmath37 be an other light ray received at @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath38 denotes a vector tangent to @xmath37 at @xmath27 , the direction of @xmath37 as observed by @xmath26 is given by eq .",
    "( [ di2 ] ) in which @xmath38 is substituted for @xmath35 . as a consequence , the angular separation between @xmath24 and @xmath37 as measured by @xmath26 may be defined as the angle @xmath39 between the two vectors @xmath36 and @xmath40 belonging to the same subspace @xmath29 ( see soffel 1988 , brumberg 1991 ) . angle @xmath39 may be characterized without ambiguity by relations as follow _",
    "u = - l__u^ .",
    "l__u^ , 0 _ u < .",
    "taking into account properties of a light ray , we have the following relations @xmath41 as @xmath28 is an unitary vector , we can express @xmath42 with @xmath43 as follows = g_00 + 2 g_0i ^i + g_ij^i^j , where ^i = = .",
    "finally , substituting equations ( [ llll]-[hlb ] ) into equation ( [ an1 ] ) yields the fundamental formula ^2 = - _ x_o , where _ 0 = 1 , _",
    "i = , _ 0 = 1 , _",
    "the determination of the angular distance thus requires explicit computations of the ratios @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    ". they can be obtained by the integration of null geodesic equations .",
    "however we will show that they result easily from the knowledge of the synge s world function .",
    "synge s world function is a scalar function of the base point @xmath46 and the field point @xmath47 .",
    "it is defined by ( synge , 1964 ) @xmath48 and the integral is evaluated on the unique geodesic @xmath49 that links @xmath46 to @xmath47 , @xmath50 being an affine parameter . a fundamental property of @xmath51 is to give an important information concerning the covariant components of the vectors tangent to @xmath49 at @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively : @xmath52 if @xmath49 is a light ray , we can consider @xmath46 as the observation point . moreover , in this case , we have @xmath53 we recently show that explicit determination of @xmath51 can be obtained from the integration of hamilton - jacobi equations without the knowkledge of @xmath49 ( le poncin - lafitte _ et al .",
    "all this means that determination of ratios @xmath44 and @xmath45 require the following steps :    * to determine @xmath51 by solving hamilton - jacobi equations , * to impose the condition @xmath54 , * to compute the following relation @xmath55",
    "in this paper , we give the general and rigorous expression of the observed angular distance between two point sources of light .",
    "the fundamental formulae ( [ an7 ] ) and ( [ cov ] ) show that the theoretical calculation of the angular distance can be carried out when the world function is known . in this idealized sense",
    ", one can say that the problem of space astrometry involves one and only one unknown function .",
    "an other important point is that the aberration and the gravitational deflection of light can not be treated as completely distinct phenomena ."
