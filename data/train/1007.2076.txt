    "the htl resummation developed by braaten and pisarski  @xcite has been used to calculate various thermodynamic quantities in the literature based on two methods .",

    "however , the 1-loop htlpt pressure has a bad perturbative lo content , in the sense of severe over - inclusion of the effect of order @xmath1 as the htl action is accurate only for soft momenta and for hard ones only in the vicinity of light cone .",
    "such problem is cured ( or at least pushed to higher orders ) only after going to 2-loop level in htlpt  @xcite , which is indeed a considerably more involved calculation .",
    "a very recent 1-loop qns calculation  @xcite from pressure in htlpt  @xcite had , obviously , the problem of over - inclusion of the order @xmath1 . moreover , it required an ad hoc separation scale to distinguish between hard and soft momenta . on the other hand the calculation of qns in ref .",

    "the equation of state ( eos ) of strongly interacting matter at nonzero baryon density and high temperature is a subject of great interest for wide spectrum of physicists .",
    "also qns is a topical quantity in view of the ongoing efforts towards understanding the actual nature of the qgp  @xcite as qns plays an important role  @xcite in locating the critical end point in qcd phase diagram .",
    "as it stands the lo thermodynamic quantities  @xcite and qns  @xcite in htl approximation  @xcite led to different results .",
    "this requires a detailed analysis of the leading order quantities within the htlpt before extending it to the higher orders . in view of this",
    "we do not aim at higher orders calculations , rather _ we intend in this article to sort out the problems in 1-loop htlpt _ , which produced different results from that of the @xmath0-derivable approach within the htl resummation  @xcite , and finally arrive at _ a consistent result despite the use of different approaches . _",

    "we note that the covariant derivative usually contains background field or any source , @xmath46 depending upon the physical requirement . to motivate the perspective we define the covariant derivative @xmath47 as @xmath48=   [ { \\tilde d}^\\mu -i\\delta^{\\mu 0}\\ \\delta j ] \\ . \\label{i1c}\\ ] ] we note that @xmath49 contains gauge coupling and @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is an infinitismal change in external source to which the response of the system can be calculated , as discussed in sec.ii .",
