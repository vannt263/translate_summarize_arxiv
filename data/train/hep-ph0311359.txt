    "in our works @xcite the nonlocal chiral quark model with quark form - factors of the gaussian type was proposed .",
    "this approach is the development of the nonlocal quark models considered in @xcite .",
    "these models are nonlocal extensions of the well - known nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model with local quark interaction @xcite .",
    "however , with nonlocal form - factors , quark loops are free of ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences and the quark confinement is possible to implement .",
    "moreover , the nonlocal structure may be motivated @xcite by fundamental qcd interactions induced by the instanton and gluon exchanges @xcite , which leads to spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry , solves @xmath4 problem and dynamically generates a momentum - dependent quark mass .",
    "the use of a covariant nonlocal low - energy quark model based on a self - consistent approach to the dynamics of quarks has many attractive features : it preserves gauge invariance , it is consistent with the low - energy theorems as well as takes into account the large - distance dynamics controlled by bound states @xcite . masses and strong decays of the scalar , vector and axial - vector mesons were considered earlier in @xcite .",
    "nonlocal models , in contrast with the local njl model , can be successfully used for the description of not only the constant part of amplitudes of meson interactions but also of the momentum expansion of amplitudes at small energies . with the help of these expansions it is possible to describe a set of important meson properties : electromagnetic radii , electric and magnetic polarizabilities , meson - meson scattering lengths , slope parameters and so on .    in the standard local njl models @xcite such expansions",
    "are not valid and can lead to incorrect results . in order to demonstrate this ,",
    "let us consider the calculation of the pion radius .",
    "the expansion of the triangle quark diagram ( fig .",
    "[ pchrad]a ) with two pions and one photon connected locally to quark lines leads to satisfactory agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "however in addition , it is necessary to take into account contribution of the diagram with the intermediate @xmath5-meson , fig .",
    "[ pchrad]e . in the framework of the local njl model",
    "this contribution is comparable with that of the contact diagram . as a result",
    ", we obtain a too large value for the pion radius which is in disagreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "some authors attempted to solve this problem , using different approaches .",
    "some of them ignored this contribution @xcite while the others used special methods beyond the standard local njl model @xcite .    in this work , we demonstrate that this problem can be solved in the framework of the nonlocal models without any additional assumption . in these models ,",
    "the contribution of the diagrams with intermediate vector mesons is shown to be suppressed .",
    "it is essentially smaller than the contribution of the contact diagram .",
    "however , without @xmath5-meson diagrams it is impossible to describe form - factor of the process @xmath6 in the time - like region .",
    "our results are in satisfactory agreement with experimental data .",
    "notice , that similar calculations in the framework of nonlocal models of different kind were also performed in other works ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the calculations are carried out in the effective chiral model with nonlocal quark - quark interaction , which is made covariant by the inclusion of the @xmath7-exponents in the non - local interaction vertex .",
    "a specific prescription for the wilson lines and their differentiation follows exactly refs .",
    "the nonlocal @xmath8 symmetric quark - meson lagrangian is given by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the pauli matrices and @xmath11 are the dirac matrices ; @xmath12 are the @xmath13 and @xmath14 quark fields ; @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath5 , @xmath21 meson fields , respectively ; @xmath22 is the photon field ; @xmath23 is the electric charge operator , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the dimensional constants of the four - quark interaction , and @xmath26 is the schwinger phase factor .",
    "the field @xmath15 has a nonzero vacuum expectation value @xmath27 . in order to obtain a physical scalar field with zero vacuum expectation value ,",
    "it is necessary to shift the scalar field as @xmath28 . in the momentum representation",
    "this leads to the appearance of the dynamical quark mass function @xmath29 . from the condition of absence of linear @xmath30 term in the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) one obtains the gap equation for the dynamical quark mass @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of colors .",
    "this and further equations are given in the euclidean space .",
    "for numeric estimates of the nonlocal effects we shall use the momentum dependent dynamical mass defined by condition @xcite @xmath33 this choice , following similar considerations given in @xcite , provides quark confinement .",
    "indeed , the expression for @xmath34 is found to be : @xmath35 depends only on one free parameter @xmath36 , has no any singularities in the whole real axis and exponentially drops as @xmath37 in the euclidean domain . from eq.([gap ] ) it follows that nonlocal form factors have similar behavior providing the absence of uv divergences in the model . at @xmath38 the mass function is equal to the cut - off parameter @xmath36 , @xmath39 , which is a specific feature of the model @xcite . from the gap equation we find the relation between four - quark coupling , @xmath24 , and the nonlocality parameter , @xmath36 , @xmath40    the expressions for meson renormalization functions",
    "are found from consideration of meson polarization operators . for the following calculations we need only the values of these functions at @xmath38 where they take the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the riemann zeta function",
    ", @xmath43 is the transversal part of the @xmath5-meson polarization operator . in the chiral limit one has two arbitrary parameters @xmath36 , @xmath25 .",
    "we fix their values with help of the weak pion decay constant @xmath44 mev , and @xmath5-meson mass @xmath45 mev . by using the goldberger - treiman relation @xmath46",
    "one finds @xmath47 mev .",
    "the constant @xmath25 is found as @xmath48 .",
    "fitting this value to the @xmath5-meson mass we obtain @xmath49 gev@xmath50 that corresponds to the coupling @xmath51 .",
    "apart from the usual local quark - photon vertex in the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) there appear quark - photon and quark - photon - meson nonlocal vertices generated by @xmath52 ( see fig .",
    "[ photonv ] ) .",
    "the details of calculation of these vertices can be found in @xcite .",
    "the explicit form of the vertices appearing in the diagrams describing photon  vector - meson transitions ( see fig .",

    "let us consider in more details the contribution of the @xmath5-meson diagrams in both the local njl model and the nonlocal model .",
    "these diagrams consist of three parts : the photon@xmath5-meson transition , the @xmath5-meson propagator , and the part describing the @xmath64 vertex .",
    "our calculations show that in the nonlocal quark models the first part is more than twice smaller than in njl , the second part does not changed , and the third part is four times smaller than in the njl model .",
    "the latter suppression is due to strong @xmath65 dependence of the amplitude occurring in the nonlocal models . as a result",
    ", we obtain almost one order decrease of the @xmath5-meson diagram contribution in the nonlocal models with respect to the prediction of the local njl model .",

    "[ ptrrad]a - c correspond to the quark loop diagrams with the local and nonlocal photon vertices ( contact diagrams ) , whereas figs .",
    "[ ptrrad]d , e correspond to diagrams with intermediate vector meson .",
    "the amplitude of the process has the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 are the two photon and the pion momentum , respectively .",
    "transition pion radius is defined as does not depend on asymmetry @xmath72 of photon virtualities @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in the case of both off - shell photons derivative in the definition of radius is taken with respect to the total virtuality of photons . ]",
    "@xmath75    in the local njl model the contact diagrams give @xmath76 @xcite , where @xmath77 is the constituent quark mass .",
    "then in the njl model without and with the @xmath78 transition one gets @xmath79",
    "@xmath61 for @xmath80 mev and @xmath81 @xmath61 for @xmath82 mev @xcite , respectively .",
    "the experimental value of the transition pion radius is @xcite @xmath83 however in the local model , the diagrams with vector mesons , figs .",
    "[ ptrrad]d , e , again additionally contribute as + @xmath84 @xmath61 that noticeably enlarges the value of the transition radius in comparison with experiment .",
    "in contrast , in the nonlocal models the vector meson diagrams are strongly suppressed .",
    "indeed , in the model considered one has @xmath85 @xmath61 and @xmath86 @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath87 @xmath61 that is in satisfactory agreement with experimental data .    we have to note that in the local njl model the diagram @xmath88 provides @xmath89 ( in normalization of eq .",
    "( [ tpgg ] ) ) and in the nonlocal model it gives @xmath90 .",
    "taking into account the value of photon  vector - meson couplings , which are the same as in the case of charged pion , we see that in the nonlocal models the contribution of vector mesons is more than four times smaller than in the local model .",
    "we would like to emphasize that nonlocal models allow us to solve a set of problems that can not be solved in the local njl models .",
    "first of all it concerns the correct description of momentum dependence of meson amplitudes in the low - energy domain .",
    "one of the examples of that is the calculation of electromagnetic meson radii .",
    "this problem is considered in present work .",
    "our calculation is devoted to the investigation of two subjects .",
    "first , the region of the effective quark interaction inside the pion is determined .",
    "the size of this region corresponds to the electromagnetic and transition radii of the pion . here",
    ", we have shown that in the model considered this region is in agreement with experimental data .",
    "next , we study relative contributions to the pion form - factor @xmath91 and pion radii from the contact diagrams and diagrams with vector mesons as intermediate states .",
    "we compare these contributions to the pion radii with the results obtained in the framework of the local njl model .",
    "we show that in the nonlocal models the contribution of vector mesons is noticeably smaller than that of the contact diagrams in contrast with the local njl model where these contributions are comparable .",
    "it is worth to note that in the nonlocal models the additional diagrams with photon interacting nonlocally with quark appear .",
    "these diagrams are important for gauge invariance .",
    "the contributions of nonlocal contact diagrams to the pion radii have the same order of magnitude as the contributions of the diagrams with vector mesons .",
    "our calculations show that the diagram with local quark - photon vertex gives the dominant part of the pion radii(see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "we have to note finally that one expects further corrections to the pion radii resulted from the so - called @xmath92 corrections that are presumably of the same order as the vector meson corrections considered in the present work ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the vector - meson diagrams play a very important role in the description of the pion form - factor @xmath93 in the time - like region .",
    "these diagrams allow us not only to describe the @xmath5-meson resonance but also to obtain a correct behavior of the form - factor in the region @xmath94 .",
    "it should be noted that the contact and vector meson diagrams increase in absolute values in the region @xmath94 , but they have opposite signs . as a result , the total contribution decreases in ( see fig .",
    "[ fppgtpartial ] ) agreement with experimental tendency @xcite .",
    "similar situation is observed in the nonlocal model considered in @xcite .",
    "however , in the present model there is an additional relation between model parameters @xmath95 and @xmath36 , @xmath39 , governed by eq.([cond ] ) . as a result ,",
    "arbitrary parameters are absent in contrast to @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in our model the fine - tuning that leads to cancellation of different contributions occurs automatically in accordance with experimental data .    in future",
    ", we plan to calculate pion electric and magnetic polarizabilities and @xmath20@xmath20 scattering lengths .",
