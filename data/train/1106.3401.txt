    "properties of graphite have attracted much attention for more than 50 years .",
    "many of that properties were successfully explained within the slonczewski  weiss",
    " mcclure ( swmc ) theory @xcite . the most accurate method to study",
    "the band structure of graphite is a study of the landau levels ( lls ) through experiments such as magneto - optics @xcite and magneto - transport @xcite .",
    "however , the interpretation of the experimental results involves a significant degree of uncertainty since , as it is not clear how the resonances should be identified and which electron transitions they correspond to .",
    "the swmc theory requires the use of many tight - binding parameters and provides the simple description of observed phenomena either in the semiclassical limit of week magnetic fields or for high frequencies when the largest tight - binding inter - layer parameter @xmath3 plays the leading role @xcite .",
    "it is more difficult to take into account the parameter @xmath4 known as `` trigonal warping '' .",
    "usually , it is either neglected @xcite or considered numerically @xcite .",
    "the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition was applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to find in low magnetic fields the level structure including the trigonal warping . in any case , only the problem of levels was considered so far , and no calculations of conductivities were done in order to evaluate the optic properties of graphite .",
    "the problem appearing for three - dimensional systems in the magnetic field connects partly with integrating over the momentum projection @xmath5 along the magnetic field .",
    "the swmc model can be simplified assuming that only the integration limits such as the @xmath6 and @xmath7 points in the brillouin zone produce the main contributions @xcite .",
    "such an approximation is similar to the theory of magneto - optical effects in topological insulators @xcite and graphene @xcite .",
    "however , the band extrema or the integration limits at the fermi level can also contribute into the absorption .",
    "therefore , the analytical expression for the dynamic conductivity in the presence of magnetic fields is needed for the interpretation of the magneto - optics experiments . in this paper , motivated by the experimental study of the faraday rotation in single- and multilayer graphene @xcite",
    ", we propose a theory of magneto - optics phenomena in graphite in strong magnetic fields including the interlayer hopping parameters @xmath4 and @xmath8 in the hamiltonian .",
    "the trigonal warping @xmath4 is considered as a perturbation with the help of the green s function method .",
    "not only the energy - level structure corrected due to the trigonal warping is found , but the expressions for the longitudinal and hall dynamical conductivities are derived .",
    "our main theoretical finding is the reflectivity and the kerr angle for graphite in strong magnetic fields .",
    "taking into account the tight - binding parameters of the swmc theory , the effective hamiltonian near the @xmath9 line of the brillouin zone in graphite writes in the form of ref .",
