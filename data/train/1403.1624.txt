    "strong electron correlation and multiconfigurational electronic states play a central role in the description of the rich magnetic behavior of polynuclear inorganic complexes of transition metal and rare earth ions with partially filled @xmath6 and @xmath7 angular momentum shells , also known as molecular nanomagnets.@xcite despite the advances of multiconfigurational ab initio methods such as casscf / caspt2 , first principles approaches are to date still too demanding to describe complexes involving more than one or two metal ions . in this scenario",
    ", simple models of electron correlation can be very helpful , both to provide interpretation of ab initio results , or to tackle large electronic structure problems .",
    "one widely used multiconfigurational atomistic model of strongly electron - correlated systems is the hubbard model.@xcite in its original formulation it provides a description of a set of @xmath4 active electrons occupying @xmath0 orthogonal orbitals localized on @xmath0 metal atoms .",
    "the simplest hubbard hamiltonian reads : @xmath8 where according to the usual notation @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the creation and annihilation operators for electrons occupying the atomic orbital at site @xmath11 with spin @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , and the angular parenthesis limits summation over nearest - neighbors .",
    "the two fundamental ingredients in the basic hubbard hamiltonian are the charge transfer term @xmath14 between nearest neighbor sites ( first term on the right hand side of eq .  ) , here parametrized by the hopping integral @xmath15 , and the on - site coulomb repulsion term , here parametrized by the two - electron repulsion integral @xmath16 .",
    "metal centers and @xmath0 electrons ( left ) or @xmath1 electrons ( right ) .",
    "the constraint @xmath17 implies that each orbital is occupied at most by one electron , and thus all electronic configurations describing the multiconfigurational states of the @xmath1 hubbard ring will always involve a single empty orbital ( shaded - atom ) . ]      despite its apparent simplicity , exact solutions to eq .",
    "are known for very few connectivities .",
    "one well - known case is that of 1-dimensional systems , also known as hubbard rings , representing an important electron correlation model for e.g. molecular wheel nanomagnets .",
    "the hubbard ring problem can be solved exactly either via the bethe ansatz , or in the case of infinite u , also via a particular unitary transformation of the basis states . here",
    "we will be interested in the infinite u case , which represents an approximation to the strong coupling limit .",
    "although the expression for the eigenvalues of the hubbard ring with infinite u and arbitrary filling is known,@xcite to the best of our knowledge the exact degeneracy of each solution has never been addressed in the literature .",
    "two particular electron - counts are clearly of greater relevance , as these counts are more likely to represent chemically stable charge - states of molecular metal rings : the half - filling electron count ( @xmath0 electrons on @xmath0 metal centers , see fig .  [ scheme1 ] left ) , and the half - filling minus one electron count ( @xmath1 electrons on @xmath0 metal centers , see fig .",
    "[ scheme1 ] right ) .",
    "note that the half - filling plus one ( @xmath18 electrons ) is obtained from the @xmath1 case simply by changing the sign of the hopping integral @xmath15 .",
    "the first case ( half - filling ) is uninteresting in the limit of infinite u , as then all @xmath19 slater determinants have the same energy , since no hopping process is permitted by the infinite value of u. in fact the half - filling case in the limit of large but finite u can be discussed also within a perturbative approach , where the hopping part of the hamiltonian couples the @xmath19 degenerate determinants arising from single occupation of the orbital , with charge transfer configurations in which one orbital is doubly occupied and another remains empty .",
    "the inclusion of the effect of the high - energy charge - transfer configurations to second order in @xmath15 leads to the mapping of the hubbard ring problem for half - filling into the heisenberg ring problem with spin one - half on site.@xcite    more interesting is the second case ( @xmath1 electrons ) in the limit of infinite u. this model represents the simplest description of the electron correlation problem arising in a mixed - valence metal ring , where one metal contributes no valence electrons , while all the others contribute one electron . for instance",
    ", singly oxidized ( and singly reduced ) infinite-@xmath3 hubbard rings can be used to describe states that are relevant for quantum transport in molecular rings devices in the coulomb - blockade regime ,  @xcite as conduction via such rings is described by electrodes - induced transitions between the states of the half - filled ring , and those of the singly oxidized or singly reduced ring , with the extra electron occupying an empty atomic orbital centred at a metal s site .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we show that the hubbard @xmath0-ring for @xmath1 electron filling can be solved exactly by mapping it into a set of hckel annulene problems for which the analytical spectrum is well known once the size of the ring is known .",
    "thus once the number @xmath0 of metal centers in the hubbard ring is known and the total number of spin - up electrons in the ring is fixed , the only problem that remains to be solved is to determine what are the sizes of the associated hckel rings , and how many hckel rings of a given size are there .",
    "this problem will be solved with the aid of group theory .",
    "finally , we will show that our group theory strategy to count the repetition of the same effective hckel spectrum in the solution of the @xmath1 hubbard problem can also be applied to count analytical solutions for any electron filling of the ring .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian  eq .   can be simplified for a metal ring with @xmath0 sites as @xmath20 where cyclic boundary conditions are imposed by identifying site @xmath18 with site 1 .",
    "the ring is occupied with @xmath21 electrons .",
    "the solutions for @xmath22 electrons are obtained easily from the solutions for @xmath23 electrons by replacing @xmath15 with @xmath24 everywhere ( this is the hole - particle transformation ) .",
    "we will therefore consider the @xmath25 cases only .",
    "when @xmath26 , eq .",
    "trivially reduces to the hamiltonian of a hckel cycle with @xmath4 noninteracting electrons , whose well - known eigenstates consist of single slater determinants with energy @xmath27 where the sum runs over the @xmath4 occupied molecular hckel orbitals , labeled by the quantum number @xmath28 , which can be interpreted as an effective orbital angular momentum component along the rotational @xmath29 axis of symmetry  @xcite ( and also representing an irreducible representation of the molecular symmetry group @xmath30 )",
    ". the angular momentum @xmath28 can take the following values : @xmath31    when @xmath32 , the problem becomes multiconfigurational and the solutions are in general not so easy to find .",
    "however , in the limit of strong on - site repulsion @xmath33 , the only relevant slater determinants are those representing an electronic configuration in which each site - orbital is either empty or singly occupied ( see figure  [ scheme1 ] on the right ) . in this case",
    "several useful statements can be made about the block - diagonal structure of the hamiltonian matrix in the basis of this particular subset of slater determinants .",
    "each of these determinants can in fact be specified completely by the row vectors @xmath34 , listing the occupied sites ( in increasing order ) , and @xmath35 ) , listing the corresponding spin values , as follows : @xmath36    in this work we will focus mainly on the @xmath1-electron count , and for this specific case it is possible to classify the one - hole determinant basis states in terms of the position of the single empty orbital @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , and the spin configuration @xmath39 for the @xmath1 sites .",
    "thus we write the basis of one - hole slater determinants as : @xmath40 we note that this phase choice has the advantage that the matrix elements of @xmath14 in this basis are equal either to @xmath24 or to zero.@xcite each of these states is also characterized by its value of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is the number of spin - up ( down ) electrons in @xmath44 . both @xmath45 and the total spin @xmath46",
    "are conserved quantities . within this space",
    "we must now diagonalize the hopping hamiltonian @xmath14 ( first part of eq .  ) . under the action of @xmath14 a spin can hop to a neighboring site only if that site is empty .",
    "since double occupations are never allowed , it follows that in a one - dimensional nearest - neighbor connectivity the ordering of a given sequence of spin - up / spin - down polarizations in @xmath44 will be conserved under the action of @xmath14",
    ". we will also refer to this @xmath44-ordering as _",
    "spin configuration_. this simple observation has a few crucial consequences :    * within a given @xmath45 subspace of slater determinants , @xmath14 will be block - diagonal in the spin configuration vector @xmath44 . * the matrix - structure of each @xmath44-block is in fact that of the hckel hamiltonian matrix for a @xmath47-annulene , with hopping integrals @xmath48 .",
    "this can be easily seen by repeated application of @xmath14 to an initial one - hole slater determinant , generating a full closed orbit ( hckel annulene ) of @xmath47 slater determinants , where each determinant is only connected by @xmath14 to _ two _ other determinants : one where the hole is one position back , and the other where the hole is one position forward ( see fig",
    ".  [ fig2 ] , illustrating the case of 2 electrons in a 3-center hubbard ring with @xmath49 , mapped into an @xmath47-annulene with @xmath50 , i.e. into hckel benzene ) .",
    "note that for electron counts different from @xmath1 , @xmath14 still generates a closed orbit of slater determinants for each given spin configuration @xmath44 , although the matrix connectivity of the graph associated to such orbit will not be a simple ring connectivity . *",
    "the n - sites hubbard ring eigenvalues obtained from each block are thus coincident with those of a hckel annulene problem with @xmath47 sites , and read @xmath51 , with @xmath52 ( if @xmath47 is even ) , or @xmath53 ( if @xmath47 is odd ) .",
    "hence , the infinite-@xmath3 hubbard ring problem is fully diagonalized provided we can ( i ) enumerate all the independent hckel rings ( i.e. spin configurations @xmath44 ) , for every given @xmath45 , and ( ii ) determine the size @xmath47 of each hckel ring ( i.e. the size of the orbit of slater determinants with same spin configuration @xmath44 , generated by repeated application of the hopping hamiltonian @xmath14 ) .",
    "we show below how this can be simply achieved for small rings , but quickly becomes a non trivial counting problem that needs be approached via the powerful techniques of group theory .",
    "let us at first consider the smallest hubbard ring , with @xmath54 and the non - trivial total spin projection @xmath49 .",
    "we have here two electrons of opposite spin polarization hopping over three metal - centered orbitals .",
    "space of six slater determinants cyclically connected by hopping integral @xmath24 .",
    "note that this is equivalent to the anticlockwise hopping of the empty site around the ring , although the starting configuration can only be obtained after two turns of the hubbard ring , turning the 3-ring into a 6-cycle . within the determinant basis space ,",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian is thus mapped into a hckel benzene , which can be analytically diagonalized ( see text ) . ]    for this simple example it is clear that only one orbit of slater determinants exists .",
    "it is in fact interesting to note that the hopping of one electron e.g. in a clockwise direction formally corresponds to the hopping of the empty orbital in the opposite ( anticlockwise ) direction , as illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "note also that the empty orbital needs to hop _",
    "twice _ around the 3-membered ring in order for the hopping hamiltonian @xmath14 to span the whole orbit of slater determinants , so that the size of this orbit for the spin configuration @xmath55 is @xmath56 .",
    "as anticipated in the previous paragraph , and shown here in figure  [ fig2 ] , if the 6-dimensional determinant basis is ordered according to consecutive hopping processes , each of the six configurations is connected by @xmath14 only to its two nearest neighbor determinants , so that hopping defines a ring of slater determinants which has double the size of the hubbard ring .",
    "the resulting block of the infinite-@xmath3 hubbard hamiltonian clearly reads : @xmath57 which is equivalent to the hckel hamiltonian for benzene .",
    "thus @xmath14 is easily diagonalized within the @xmath49 subspace , leading to a spectrum with the six eigenvalues @xmath58 , for @xmath59 . as for the triplet projections @xmath60",
    ", the matrix representation of @xmath14 can be mapped into a hckel @xmath61$]-annulene , with the three eigenvalues @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "note that if @xmath64 , the ground state is high - spin ( triplet ) , as expected for rings with @xmath54 and @xmath65 , where nagaoka s theorem is fulfilled.@xcite      the case of four electrons in a hubbard ring with five metal centers represents the smallest 1d - hubbard problem for which we encounter multiple orbits / spin configurations within a given value of @xmath45 . in the case",
    "@xmath49 we can build two families of slater determinants , one corresponding to an alternating spin configuration @xmath66 , the other @xmath67 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "it is evident that these two families of determinants can not be connected via simple hopping process .",
    "thus the @xmath49 subspace is further block - diagonalized into two subspaces , each subspace corresponding to a different orbit .",
    "spin projection space , for four electrons in five orbitals .",
    "note that these two orbits of spin configurations under the action of the hopping hamiltonian @xmath14 generate an adjacency matrix for two distinct hckel rings , one with ten vertices , the second with 20 vertices . ]    in particular , by repeatedly applying the hopping hamiltonian @xmath14 to any determinant with spin configuration @xmath68 ( top of figure  [ fig3 ] ) , the hole has to hop twice around the 5-hubbard ring to get back to starting configuration , so that the length of this orbit is @xmath69 .",
    "the block @xmath68 of the hubbard hamiltonian is thus mapped into the eigenvalue problem for the hckel [ 10]-ring , with spectrum @xmath70 , @xmath71 . on the other hand",
    ", it can be seen by direct inspection that the full orbit of determinants corresponding to the spin configuration @xmath72 ( bottom of figure  [ fig3 ] ) can be generated if the hole hops four times around the 5-hubbard ring , so that @xmath73 .",
    "the hubbard block @xmath72 is thus equivalent to the huckel hamiltonian for a [ 20]annulene , with spectrum @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "from the previous examples we note that the size of the hckel annulenes associated to the @xmath44-blocks is always an integer multiple of the number of metal centers @xmath0 in the hubbard ring , as the hole must always hop in units of @xmath0-steps to get back to the initial site and close the spin - configuration orbit .",
    "the problem is to find how many times the hole has to hop around the hubbard ring in order to span the full orbit . for small hubbard rings ,",
    "it is easy enough to work this out by inspection .",
    "however , the problem becomes increasingly tedious as @xmath0 becomes larger .    a systematic strategy to enumerate hckel annulenes and determine their sizes for each given @xmath45 is offered by group theory .",
    "the connection between enumeration of orbits of slater determinants / hckel annulenes , and group theory , can be readily made by noting that after each single turn of the empty orbital around the hubbard ring , _ the spin configuration @xmath44 undergoes a cyclic permutation _ within the remaining @xmath1 occupied sites .",
    "if all @xmath1 occupied sites have parallel spins ( @xmath76 ) , the cyclically permuted spin configuration is indistinguishable from the initial spin configuration , thus a single turn of the empty orbital around the hubbard ring suffices to generate a full orbit of slater determinants , and the associated hckel ring has the same size as the hubbard ring ( i.e. @xmath77 ) .",
    "this implies that the spectrum of the @xmath0-hubbard ring with @xmath1 electrons for @xmath76 corresponds to the hckel spectrum of an @xmath78$]-annulene with resonance integral @xmath48 .",
    "the eigenvalues are therefore @xmath79 , with @xmath80 if @xmath0 is even , or @xmath81 if n is odd . beside the pure spin @xmath82 double degeneracy , these states present additional orbital double - degeneracies associated to the axial orbital angular momentum quantum number @xmath83 , as it is found in common hckel @xmath78$]-annulenes .    for @xmath84 ,",
    "the cyclically permuted spin configuration @xmath44 generated by @xmath0 hopping processes is not equivalent to the initial spin configuration .",
    "the effect of @xmath0-hopping processes on a one - hole determinant is thus equivalent to the action of the cyclic permutation @xmath85 ( generator of the permutation group @xmath2 ) on a two - color necklace with @xmath1 beads , where a given bead has color x ( y ) if the corresponding occupied site in the hubbard ring has spin up ( down ) .",
    "the two - colored necklace is in fact a representation of the spin - ordered configuration @xmath44 under scrutiny , where the ratio between the number of beads with different color is fixed by the value of @xmath45 .",
    "crucially , the problem of enumerating @xmath44 spin configurations for a given @xmath45 that are not connected by hopping processes ( i.e.  enumerating hckel annulenes ) , is now mapped into the well - known combinatorial problem of enumerating symmetry - unique ( i.e.  not related by cyclic permutations ) necklaces with @xmath1 beads of two colors , with a fixed ratio between beads of different colors .",
    "furthermore , grouping together all necklaces of like symmetry , that is all distinguishable necklaces that can be rotated into each other by repeated application of a cyclic permutation @xmath85 , we obtain orbits of two - color necklaces with size @xmath86 .",
    "the length of each hckel annulene associated with a fixed @xmath45 hubbard problem can now be found by determining the length @xmath86 of the associated necklace - orbit generated by the action of the cyclic permutation group @xmath2 on a representative necklace configuration .",
    "once the length of each necklace orbit has been determined , the size of the associated hckel ring @xmath47 , thus the corresponding set of hubbard eigenvalues , is easily determined as : @xmath87     spin projection space , for the infinite-@xmath3 hubbard problem of four active electrons in five orbitals .",
    "the necklace orbit - length is reported as @xmath86 . to obtain the full slater determinant orbit length ( hence the length of the associated hckel rings ) the necklace orbit length @xmath86",
    "must be multiplied by the number of metal centers ( i.e.  by five in this case ) , as detailed in eq .  .",
    "]    to illustrate the mapping of the hckel annulenes enumeration problem , into a necklace enumeration problem , let us consider the two slater determinant orbits found in the previous section for the case of four electrons in five active orbitals ( see also figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the mapping process is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , where beads of color x and y are represented by black and red beads .",
    "here we have @xmath88 , so we start off with a 4-beaded necklace which has full permutation symmetry @xmath89 if all beads have the same color ( @xmath90 ) . for the @xmath49 space , the two spin configurations @xmath66 and @xmath67 identified in the previous paragraph",
    "can now be mapped into two symmetry - unique necklace configurations , with two black beads , and two red beads .",
    "in fact , decoration of the @xmath89 necklace backbone with beads of two different colors can only lead to necklaces whose symmetry is described by a subgroup of @xmath89 .",
    "the group @xmath89 has three subgroups : @xmath89 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( i.e. no symmetry ) .",
    "by inspection , it is clear that the necklace associated to @xmath66 ( top of figure  [ fig4 ] ) has permutation symmetry @xmath91 , while the necklace associated to @xmath67 has symmetry @xmath92 .",
    "the size of the necklace orbits can be easily found by inspection in this case .",
    "if we consider the four symmetry operations of the group @xmath93 , by definition the necklace with symmetry @xmath91 will be invariant with respect to the action of identity and @xmath94 , and will only be rotated into a distinguishable configuration under the action of @xmath95 .",
    "the orbit is consequently composed of two configurations only ( @xmath96 , see top of figure  [ fig4 ] ) . on the other hand , the necklace with symmetry @xmath92 will be rotated into four symmetry - related but distinguishable necklaces by the action of @xmath89 , thus generating an orbit of size @xmath97 ( see bottom of figure  [ fig4 ] ) . according to eq .",
    ", the size of the corresponding hckel annulenes can then be found as @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "this reasoning can be made more rigorous within group theory , by exploring the relationship between groups , subgroups and orbits .",
    "it is in fact well known that in a structure with a given symmetry group ( e.g. a molecule ) , orbits of symmetry - related points ( e.g. atoms , atomic orbitals , bonds , etc . )",
    "can be fully characterised in terms of those subgroups describing the site or local symmetry of these points .",
    "@xcite group / subgroup relationships describing orbits in molecular graphs have been used to characterise fundamental chemical and physical properties of molecules .",
    "@xcite    more specifically , given a high - symmetry structure described by the group @xmath100 , there is a well - defined link between ( i ) the symmetry descent from @xmath100 to one of its subgroups @xmath101 describing symmetry - lowering of the structure upon decoration ( @xmath101 plays the role of a site - symmetry ) , and ( ii ) the size of the orbits generated by the action of the higher symmetry group @xmath100 on the lower - symmetry decorated structures . in particular , the size of the orbit spanned by the @xmath101-symmetry decorated structures , is simply the ratio between the number of elements in the higher group generating the orbit ( order @xmath102 of the higher group ) , and the order @xmath103 of the subgroup . in brief , @xmath104 .",

    "in the previous paragraph we have established that each spin configuration @xmath44 within a given spin projection @xmath45 is mapped into necklace configurations consisting of @xmath4 sites ( so far we have only considered the case @xmath107 ) decorated with beads of at most two different colors , x and y ( spin - up and spin - down ) .",

    "a point group @xmath100 of order @xmath4 can be characterized by a non - redundant set of @xmath122 subgroups @xmath123 , each of which , in turn , gives rise to a ( right ) coset - decomposition of the group @xmath100 : @xmath124 where , if @xmath125 is the order of the subgroup @xmath101 , @xmath126 are the @xmath127 representatives ( or transversals ) of the @xmath128 cosets associated to the subgroup @xmath101 , with @xmath129 the identity operator .",

    "<S> we present a full analytical solution of the multiconfigurational strongly - correlated mixed - valence problem corresponding to the @xmath0-hubbard ring filled with @xmath1 electrons , and infinite on - site repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> while the eigenvalues and the eigenstates of the model are known already , analytical determination of their degeneracy is presented here for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the full solution , including degeneracy count , is achieved for each spin configuration by mapping the hubbard model into a set of hckel - annulene problems for rings of variable size . </S>",
    "<S> the _ number _ and _ size _ of these effective hckel annulenes , both crucial to obtain hubbard states and their degeneracy , are determined by solving a well - known combinatorial enumeration problem , the necklace problem for @xmath1 beads and two colors , within each subgroup of the @xmath2 permutation group . </S>",
