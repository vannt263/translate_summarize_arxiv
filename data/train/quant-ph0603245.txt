    "quantum statistical mechanics is usually based on the canonical ensemble described by the density matrix @xmath0 , with @xmath1 . in his celebrated book on statistical thermodynamics ,",
    "schrdinger  @xcite remarked that `` this assumption is irreconcilable with the very foundations of quantum mechanics '' because microsystems in general will not be in an energy eigenstate .",
    "the reason why this assumption can be accepted is that a more consistent attitude `` leads to the same thermodynamical results '' .",
    "the more consistent attitude , according to schrdinger , consists in introducing an ensemble over the states ( wave functions ) in which one attributes the same probability to all the highly degenerate energy states of a macroscopic system .",
    "he then shows that for a subsystem one expects the canonical ensemble to be approximately correct . in a recent paper @xcite schrdinger s statement has been substantially strengthened .",
    "see also @xcite .    in the last decade",
    "the remarkable developments in quantum optics , mesoscopic and cold atom physics have given reality to wave functions .",
    "it is enough to think of the many realizations of `` schrdinger cats '' or of coherent states .",
    "it is then interesting to explore the consequences of assuming ensembles over the wave functions simply related to the canonical density matrix .",
    "a guide in the choice of an ensemble is the observation that the schrdinger equation , @xmath2 , and its complex conjugate can be considered as an infinite dimensional hamiltonian system in the variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 with hamiltonian @xmath5 .",
    "it is therefore natural to concentrate our attention on measures invariant under this dynamics . in  @xcite an ensemble over the wave functions",
    "was introduced , hereafter named schrdinger - gibbs ( sg ) ensemble , with formal measure @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the usual scalar product in the hilbert space .",
    "a simple calculation shows that in terms of ( [ sgmeasure ] ) the canonical ensemble can be written @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the _",
    "unnormalized _ eigenstates of @xmath10 , assumed to have a discrete spectrum .",
    "in @xcite the motivation was to calculate the distribution of quantum expectation values of the operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 induced by the sg ensemble .",
    "a formula for such a distribution was found at low temperature and the wave functions giving the largest contributions were characterized in terms of an appropriate legendre transform of the ground state energy of the system in an external field .",
    "these wave functions in the case of the harmonic oscillator are the usual coherent states and , by analogy , we shall adopt this name also in the general case .    the distribution for the expectation values @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath14 is different from that obtained with the usual quantum canonical ensemble .",
    "for example , in the latter case for reflection invariant systems @xmath13 does not fluctuate at all , a rather unphysical result .    in this paper ,",
    "after recalling the main steps in  @xcite , we analyze in detail the case of a one - dimensional double well , which is an ubiquitous system in physics and deeply non classical at low energies .",
    "the result is a gibbsian distribution of the expectation values @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the form @xmath15\\}$ ] , where @xmath16 is an effective potential with a single minimum .",
    "this minimum is at zero for the symmetric double well or near the point where the ground state function is concentrated in the asymmetric case .",
    "this result may be of interest in connection with pyramidal molecules , like ammonia or other molecules potentially chiral .",
    "for these systems which are adequately described , as far as the inversion degrees of freedom are concerned , by a symmetric double well @xcite , fluctuations of @xmath13 correspond to fluctuations of the electric dipole moment and could be in principle observable providing thereby a test of the statistical assumption ( [ sgmeasure ] ) .",
    "we discuss first the harmonic oscillator defined by the hamiltonian @xmath17 . for this system the heisenberg equations of motion of the canonical operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 , namely @xmath18 and @xmath19 , bring to the @xmath20-number equations for the expectations @xmath21 in the following , we will use the notation @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the hamiltonian flow ( [ hfhoq]-[hfhop ] ) admits the canonical invariant measure @xmath24 dqdp$ ] , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a constant .",
    "we want to show that this result can be obtained from the formal sg - measure ( [ sgmeasure ] ) .",
    "the probability density of the expectation values @xmath27 and @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 the fourier transform of the above expression can be evaluated exactly and transforming back to the variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 one finds @xmath30.\\ ] ]    it is interesting to determine which kind of wave functions contribute mostly to @xmath31 in the low temperature regime @xmath32 . to this purpose",
    "we have to minimize @xmath5 with the three constraints @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "once more the calculation can be performed exactly and one finds that the minimizing wave functions are @xmath36,\\ ] ] _ i.e. _ the harmonic oscillator coherent states .",
    "we wish now to generalize the above results to systems described by hamiltonians @xmath37 with non quadratic potentials @xmath38 . in that case",
    ", the density @xmath31 can not be evaluated exactly , however , we can estimate it for low temperatures .",
    "in fact , for @xmath26 large from steepest descent we have @xmath39,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 means asymptotic logarithmic equality and @xmath41 is a normalized state which minimizes the expectation of @xmath10 with the constraints @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "first we get rid of the latter constraint by putting @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the state @xmath46 is determined as the ground state @xmath47 of the eigenvalue problem @xmath48 solved self - consistently with the lagrange multiplier @xmath49 specified by the condition @xmath50 if @xmath51 is the eigenvalue associated to the ground state @xmath47 , we have @xmath52 in conclusion , we obtain @xmath53,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the effective potential @xmath54 is evaluated by solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem ( [ eigprob]-[lc ] ) . in analogy to the harmonic oscillator case , we call @xmath55 coherent states .    on the other hand , in the canonical ensemble for the probability density of the expectations of @xmath27 and @xmath28 we immediately obtain @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 . here , @xmath59 are the normalized eigenstates of @xmath10 with eigenvalues @xmath60 .",
    "in particular , for system invariant under reflection we have @xmath61 .",
    "we consider a particle in a symmetric double well potential of the form @xmath62 and solve numerically the nonlinear eigenvalue problem ( [ eigprob]-[lc ] ) to obtain the effective potential @xmath63 .",
    "this task is accomplished efficiently by the selective relaxation algorithm @xcite .",
    "the results are reported in fig .",
    "we expect that in this problem one can approximate the original hamiltonian @xmath10 with a two - state hamiltonian restricted to the lowest two eigenfunctions of @xmath10 corresponding to the splitting of the ground state induced by tunneling .",
    "for this reason , we report in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] both the exact numerical calculations and the two - state approximation . in the latter case ,",
    "the effective potential can be evaluated analytically and one finds @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the lowest eigenstates of @xmath10 with eigenvalues @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that the two - state approximation is rather good and , in fact , it becomes more and more accurate in the semiclassical limit , for example by increasing the value of the mass @xmath70 .     as a function of the rescaled expectation @xmath71 evaluated numerically for the double well potential ( [ dwp ] ) with different values of the mass @xmath70 .",
    "the solid thick line represents the two - state approximation ( [ veffdw ] ) . for the other parameters we set , in all cases , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the values of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath75 used in the rescaling have been evaluated numerically and are : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 for @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 for @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 for @xmath91 . ]     as a function of the rescaled temperature @xmath92 evaluated numerically for the double well potential ( [ dwp ] ) with different values of the mass @xmath70 as in fig .",
    "the solid thick line is the approximated result obtained from @xmath93 given by eq .",
    "( [ veffdw ] ) . ]      in the semiclassical limit the difference @xmath96 tends to zero exponentially and the effective potential becomes flat between @xmath97 . in this limit @xmath98",
    "this reflects the fact that the two levels become equiprobable for low temperatures so that any superposition of the corresponding states has the same probability . in the same limit",
