    ": they can summarize essential features of signals in a few numbers employing straightforward computations , which makes them excellent precursors of more detailed analyses like modelling and classification .",
    "herein , a simple effects of irregular sampling on the characterization of a signal in terms of statistical parameters is presented .",
    "separate works describe corrections of biases induced by small sample sizes and gaussian uncertainties in the calculation of weighted moments and cumulants @xcite .",
    "time series sampled irregularly or with varying candences may lead to very different estimates of statistical parameters for the same signal .",
    "for example , if a sinusoid is sampled mostly at maximum or minimum , the mean is offset by about the amplitude of the signal , the variance might be much smaller than expected ( since most points sample the same region of the signal ) , and the distribution appears very skewed ( the few non - clumped measurements form an asymmetric tail in the distribution of measurements ) .",
    "if the same clump of data was in proximity of the average level , instead , the mean and skewness values could be close to the correct value ( by serendipity ) , but the variance would be much smaller than the true one .",
    "sampling - induced biases do not arise from sparsely sampled data only and they might manifest independently of the number of measurements .",
    "while time series with more measurements are generally associated with better coverage of signal features , the importance implicitly assigned to different parts of the signal by unweighted estimators is related to the relative frequency of measurements .    in principle",
    ", the most accurate and precise statistical parameters could be inferred from the model of a signal .",
    "alas , models are often complicated , in the attempt to describe the signal features under many circumstances , they might require lengthy processing and their accuracy can not be guaranteed in all cases . for example , fourier series are well fitted to model periodic signals , but the description of sharp features , like those present in ea - type eclipsing binaries , requires a high number of harmonics , which can overfit smoother parts of the signal and cause unrealistic excursions in large intervals with no data @xcite .",
    "linear interpolation is one of the simplest methods to approximate a model , assuming the signal features are sufficiently sampled",
    ". this work estimates statistical parameters by averaging the linear interpolation of functions of time series measurements ( depending on the specific estimator ) .",
    "if the signal can be recognized in time domain , interpolation can be performed in time without requiring further information .",
    "if a sparsely sampled signal is primarily mono - periodic , it can be interpolated in phase by folding the time series with the corresponding period .",
    "while the interpolated function might include profiles with spiky artefacts , its average is more robust and can be expressed as a weighted mean which assigns more relevance to scattered than clumped measurements .",
    "statistical parameters weighted by such a scheme were tested on data from the _ hipparcos _ periodic catalogue and led to a significant general improvement in the accuracy and precision of estimator values and automated classification results , with respect to those obtained with the unweighted or error - weighted counterparts .",

    "the proposed weighting scheme is derived from linear interpolation and thus all of its pros and cons are inherited by definition . strictly speaking , statistical estimators like the mean and moments",
    "are not defined for deterministic signals .",
    "however , such estimators can still give acceptable approximations when the time scale of features ( or period ) is much smaller than the time series duration .",
    "in the case of mono - periodic signals , the proposed weighting scheme leads to estimator values of the signal as if the latter was measured on a complete cycle .",
    "( population ) value of a statistical parameter @xmath17 of a continuous signal @xmath18 in time  @xmath19 is computed by integrating function of such a signal : @xmath20 in case of regular sampling in fine intervals , sum of discrete elements tends to the population result for infinitely small intervals .",
    "this limit is not necessarily satisfied when a continuous signal is sampled irregularly .",
    "the weighting scheme described in sec .",
    "[ sec : weights ] recovers the property that the sum of discrete ( weighted ) terms approaches the result of the continuous function , in the limit of very dense ( not necessarily uniform ) sampling .",
    "linear interpolation is a simple method to approximate a function with a broken line connecting the data points , provided the function is sufficiently sampled in time or phase . in this section , such a function",
    "is represented by the expression of the additive terms of a statistical estimator . for example , a central moment of order @xmath3 is defined by the average of terms of the form @xmath21 .",
    "results from linearly interpolating such a function are equivalent to those obtained from an effectively infinite regular sampling of the interpolated function . in sec .",
    "[ sec : weights ] , it is shown that the average of a linear interpolation can be expressed as a weighted mean .",

    "the other panels illustrate different powers of deviations from the mean of the true signal ( blue curve ) and of the measurements ( red circles ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath24 identifies terms associated with the central moments of order @xmath3 : these estimator values are related to the areas enclosed by the blue curves and the zero level ( shaded in blue ) .",
    "the weights defined by eqs  ( [ eq : pwi])([eq : pwn ] ) define the variable widths of the shaded bars , which reduce the contribution of clustered measurements and increase the one of scattered data . in this case , although most measurements sample the first half of the signal , the increased weights assigned to the remaining data provides a better estimate of the area enclosed by the second half of the signal than using unweighted schemes . ]    since more importance is given to some measurements at the expense of other ones ( e.g. , a large sample with only a few important elements will be similar to one with only these few elements ) and exploiting correlations in the data with weights ( e.g. , assigning small weights to measurements separated by small intervals because their values are expected to be similar ) might introduce biases if applied to expressions assuming independent data .",
    "however , small biases could be justified by significant improvements in precision and a mixed weighting scheme which balances precision and accuracy depending on the signal - to - noise ( @xmath25 ) level and sample size is described in sec .",

    "@xcite missions , linear interpolation is expected to provide reliable approximations of and weights might be expressed in time domain .",
    "if typical time intervals between measurements are larger than the resolution needed to sample the signal ( as it is often the case in the _ hipparcos _ and _ gaia _ surveys ) but the latter is mono - periodic or dominated by a single period , sampling can be improved by folding the light curve with the value of the fundamental period and computing interpolations ( or weights ) in phase .    the interpolation - based weighting scheme .",
    "if gaps in time or phase occasionally cover a relevant fraction of a signal , measurements at the gap boundaries might not provide sufficient information on the features of the signal and the importance of such data could be limited , for example , to some maximum weight value .",
    "this strategy can extend the applicability of the weighting scheme to under - sampled signals , periodic or non - periodic , to mitigate statistical biases due to data clumps on scales smaller than the signal features          if sampling in time is sparse but the data exhibit periodicity , the time series can be folded with the dominant period to increase the average sampling rate in phase ( by a factor the duration of the time series divided by the period ) .    since interpolation of phase - sorted data",
