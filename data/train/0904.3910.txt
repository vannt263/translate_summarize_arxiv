    "the mere existence of the heaviest and superheavy nuclei with @xmath1@xmath5104 is primarily determined by shell effects @xcite . the ground - state ( g.s . ) shell corrections also determine fission barriers of those systems @xcite as their liquid - drop fission barriers are negligible",
    ". the discoveries of new elements using the cold- and hot - fusion reactions @xcite over the last decade provide us with fundamental information about the structure of the nucleus and the possible existence of the  island of stability \" at the limit of the nuclear mass and charge .    since the cross sections for production of superheavy nuclei using combinations of available stable projectiles and targets are exceedingly low , the major experimental challenge is to find optimal conditions that would lead to the synthesis of the species of interest @xcite .",
    "isotopes of elements with @xmath1 up to 113 have been produced in cold - fusion reactions using lead or bismuth targets . in these experiments , the compound nucleus ( cn )",
    "is formed at relatively low excitation energies @xmath6 of @xmath710 - 12 mev .",
    "recently , using the beams of @xmath8ca and actinide targets , superheavy elements with @xmath1=112 - 116 and 118 have been synthesized @xcite .",
    "the compound nuclei formed in such hot - fusion reactions are more neutron - rich than those produced in cold - fusion experiments , and they are significantly more excited , @xmath6@xmath736 - 40mev .    the crucial quantity that determines the synthesis of superheavy elements is the cn survival probability @xcite , which strongly depends on the fission barrier characteristics . since",
    "shell effects are quenched at high temperatures ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the stability of the heaviest and superheavy elements with respect to particle emission and fission is expected to strongly depend on excitation energy .    in the previous paper @xcite",
    ", it was demonstrated that fission barriers of excited superheavy nuclei vary rapidly with particle number .",
    "the main objective of the present study is to address this question globally by performing systematic calculations of fission barriers of superheavy nuclei as a function of excitation energy .",
    "our survey has been carried out within the nuclear density functional theory ( dft ) generalized to finite temperatures .",
    "guided by results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the fission process is isentropic in character .",
    "the effects due to the @xmath9 dependence of triaxial and reflection asymmetric deformations are quantified and the resulting barrier damping parameters are extracted .",
    "we also investigate the transition from asymmetric to symmetric fission with increasing excitation energy .",
    "experimental studies @xcite indicate that there is a systematic increase in the symmetric mass yield relative to the asymmetric one with excitation energy . by calculating the reflection - asymmetric deformations along static fission pathways ,",
    "we show that such a transition indeed takes place in selected nuclei .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ hfb - t ] briefly summarizes the ft - hfb formalism . in particular , the need for an isentropic , rather than an isothermal , description of the fission process at finite excitation energy is emphasized .",

    "excitation - energy dependence of fission pathways for two representative nuclei , @xmath3pu and @xmath4fm , is discussed in sec .",
    "[ results ] together with the results of our systematic calculations of the excitation - energy dependence of the inner fission barrier of superheavy elements .",
    "our survey clearly demonstrates that the damping of the first barrier with @xmath9 exhibits an appreciable dependence on shell effects .",
    "finally , the summary of our work is contained in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "within the mean - field approach , heated nuclei can be self - consistently treated by the finite - temperature dft , either within hartree - fock ( hf ) @xcite or , if pairing is considered , in the finite - temperature hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium state of a nucleus at a fixed temperature @xmath10 and chemical potential @xmath11 is obtained from the minimization of the grand canonical potential @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13=@xmath14 is the average energy , @xmath15=@xmath16 is the entropy , @xmath2=@xmath17 is the particle - number , and the density operator @xmath18 given by @xmath19 with @xmath20 . in the mean - field approximation , the two - body density operator defined in eq .",
    "( [ denmat ] ) is replaced by a one - body counterpart .",
    "the variation of @xmath21 , with respect to density , leads to the temperature - dependent hfb equations  @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the temperature - dependent hfb hamiltonian .",
    "finite - temperature particle and pairing density matrices @xcite in the ft - hfb formalism are given by @xmath24 and depend on the fermi occupations @xmath25 .",
    "the isothermal scenario , sometimes assumed in the context of fission process @xcite , can not be correct as the compound nucleus is not in contact with a heat bath .",
    "considering the fission as an adiabatic process , the isentropic picture seems to be more appropriate @xcite . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the two descriptions of fission can be operationally related through the thermodynamical identity @xmath26 , which simply states that the generalized driving force associated with the deformation @xmath27 depends only on the state of the system .",
    "this identity , useful in practical calculations , has recently been verified numerically in ref .  @xcite",
    "wherein the importance of self - consistency has been pointed out .    in this work , we shall follow the isentropic picture .",
    "the entropy @xmath28 has been defined as in @xcite , i.e. , it corresponds to the free energy minimum at temperature @xmath29 .",
    "this value of @xmath15 is then kept fixed along the fission path . in this way , the temperature changes with deformation . in particular",
    ", the temperature of the lowest minimum is always greater than that of the first barrier , and this difference is crucial for the fission barrier damping .",
    "barrier heights obtained within the hfb and hf+bcs approaches are quite similar at low temperatures @xcite . moreover , beyond @xmath30 mev , the two approaches are identical as the static pairing vanishes @xcite .",
    "for that reason , in this study we shall present the ft - hf+bcs results only .    our ft - hf+bcs calculations were carried out with the skyrme skm@xmath0 functional  @xcite in the particle - hole channel .",
    "this functional has been optimized at large deformations ; hence , it is often used for fission barrier predictions . in the pairing channel ,",
    "we employed the density - dependent delta interaction in the mixed variant @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32@xmath33 .",
    "the pairing - active space in bcs was assumed to consist of the lowest @xmath34 proton / neutron hf levels .",
    "the pairing interaction strengths @xmath35 are @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( in mev@xmath38 ) for protons and neutrons , respectively . they were adjusted to reproduce the experimental odd - even mass differences in @xmath39fm .",
    "it is known from numerous studies @xcite that the first saddle point is lowered by several mev by triaxial degrees of freedom and that beyond the first barrier reflection - asymmetric deformations may become important . therefore , when studying saddle points and fission pathways , it is imperative to employ a model which is capable of breaking axial and mirror symmetries simultaneously .",
    "for that reason , we employed a symmetry - unrestricted dft solver hfodd @xcite capable of treating simultaneously all possible collective degrees of freedom that might appear on the way to fission . in the present work ,",
    "we adopted the hfodd solver to the ft - hfb and ft - hf+bcs frameworks along the lines of sec .",
    "[ hfb - t ] .",
    "the main objective of this study is to provide a microscopic description of fission of excited nuclei , based on the nuclear dft . to this end",
    ", we solve the constrained ft - hf+bcs problem along a collective path defined by a mass quadrupole moment @xmath27 . at each value of @xmath27 ,",
    "self - consistent equations are solved , whereupon the total energy of the system is always minimized with respect to all remaining shape parameters . along the optimum path found in this way ,",
    "axial and mirror symmetries can be broken , i.e. , the multipole moments @xmath40 and/or",
    "@xmath41 may be nonzero . figure  [ fig1 ] shows the fission pathways for @xmath3pu and @xmath4fm .",
    "the former nucleus is known to fission asymmetrically while the later one is on the edge of the transition from asymmetric to symmetric fission @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , expected that the fission pathways of these two nuclei would evolve somewhat differently with increasing excitation energy .    for @xmath3pu",
    ", the optimal fission pathway at zero temperature exhibits the familiar two - humped structure . at @xmath42=1.0mev ( @xmath9=13.82mev ) , both saddle points are reduced by 2 - 2.5mev .",
    "the isentropic barriers are rapidly quenched with @xmath9 , and they become very small at @xmath42=2mev ( @xmath9=70.88mev ) due to the thermal melting of shell effects . in order to assess the impact of triaxiality on the first , and mirror asymmetry on the second saddle point , we computed the axial reflection - symmetric energy curve for @xmath3pu ( marked as  sym \" in fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the non - axial ( @xmath40 ) and reflection asymmetric ( @xmath41 ) moments along the optimal fission pathway are shown in fig .",
    "the energy gain on the first barrier due to triaxiality , quite appreciable at @xmath10=0 , becomes practically negligible at @xmath42=1.5mev while the corresponding quadrupole moment @xmath40 is nonzero even at @xmath42=2mev .",
    "this indicates that at large excitation energies the energy surface of @xmath3pu becomes very soft in the triaxial direction .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn for the reflection asymmetric degree of freedom @xmath41 and its impact on the outer barrier .",
    "experimentally , there is clear evidence for a transition from asymmetric to symmetric fission with excitation energy @xcite .",
    "the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are consistent with the observed change in the pattern of fission yields .",
    "indeed , at @xmath42=2  mev the calculated optimal fission pathway shows a very weak octupole effect .    to further explore the transition from asymmetric to symmetric fission",
    ", we now consider @xmath4fm . in the heavy fm isotopes ,",
    "a sharp transition has been observed @xcite from an asymmetric mass division of spontaneous fission products in @xmath4fm to a symmetric mass split in @xmath43fm . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , at @xmath44=0 the second barrier along the symmetric fission pathway is very broad as compared to the asymmetric case , and this explains the asymmetric distribution of fission products observed experimentally .",
    "however , at @xmath45=1.5mev , the symmetric pathway becomes close in energy to the asymmetric one .",
    "this indicates that competition between asymmetric and symmetric fission is expected to occur in @xmath4fm at lower excitation energies than in @xmath3pu .",
    "we would now like to address the important question of the synthesis of superheavy elements in heavy - ion fusion reactions .",
    "it has already been mentioned that the crucial quanity in the synthesis is the survival probablity , which depends on the quenching of the fission barrier height with @xmath9 . in order to obtain a better understanding of how the shell effects impact the @xmath9 dependence of the first saddle point of superheavy nuclei , we performed systematic ft - hfb calculations for 48 even - even nuclei with 110@xmath46@xmath1@xmath46124 and 166@xmath46@xmath2@xmath46188 . a sample result illustrating our methodology",
    "is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for @xmath1=112 , 118 , and 124 .",
    "the dependence of a fission barrier @xmath47 on @xmath9 is usually approximated by a phenomenological expression @xcite @xmath48 where the barrier damping parameter @xmath49 characterizes the rate of the barrier quenching with excitation energy .",
    "it is clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that the ansatz ( [ damp ] ) well describes the ft - hf+bcs results and the parameter @xmath49 can be meaningfully extracted for every nucleus .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that many physical effects impact @xmath50-vs-@xmath9 dependence .",
    "( in addition to a direct dependence of @xmath50 on entropy , significant contributions come from self - consistent variations of nuclear mean fields with @xmath15 , most notably the gradual decrease of triaxiality .",
    "the quenching of the pairing energy does not impact the extracted values of @xmath49 as the low-@xmath9 part of @xmath50 was not considered when extracting the slope of @xmath51 . ) when inspecting fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , one can notice rather dramatic isotonic variations of the damping rate for @xmath1=112 . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the isentropic picture , the observed pattern can be attributed to the higher temperature of the lowest minimum as compared to that of saddle point .",
    "the survey of @xmath52 obtained in this work , shown in fig  [ fig4 ] , nicely illustrates the appreciable particle number dependence of barrier damping .",
    "the maximum of @xmath52 is predicted for @xmath2=176 and 178 , while for @xmath2=166 and 168 @xmath52 is fairly small , indicating a rapid decrease of barrier heights with @xmath9 around @xmath53112 , i.e. , in the region of deformed superheavy nuclei stabilized by the deformed subshell closure @xmath2=162 @xcite . for heavier systems with @xmath1=122 and 124 ,",
    "the largest barrier damping effect is expected around @xmath2=182 and 184 , i.e. , in the region of the enhanced shell stability around the expected spherical @xmath2=184 magic gap @xcite .",
    "the strong dependence of the barrier damping parameter on @xmath2 and @xmath1 indicates the importance of shell effects when modeling the formation of superheavy elements .",
    "in conclusion , we performed systematic self - consistent calculations of thermal fission barriers of superheavy nuclei based on the ft - hf+bcs extension of the solver hfodd that is capable of describing arbitrary shapes free from self - consistent symmetry constraints .",
    "our survey of the fission barrier damping parameter demonstrates the existence of strong shell effects on @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , the fastest decrease of fission barriers with excitation energy is predicted for deformed nuclei around @xmath2=164 and spherical nuclei around @xmath2=184 that are strongly stabilized by g.s .",
    "shell effects . on the other hand , for the transitional nuclei around @xmath2=176 ,",
