    "regular monitoring of total solar irradiance ( tsi ) by space - based radiometers started in 1978 and has continued without major interruptions since then , although no single instrument so far managed to survive longer than a single solar activity cycle .",
    "crosscalibrating and combining the data from the different radiometers into one record is not without problems , and three independent groups have constructed distinct composites of the sun s total irradiance from the measurements @xcite .",
    "these time series show substantial differences , in particular regarding the long - term trend of the irradiance .",
    "this is best seen as the difference between the tsi during the minima preceding solar cycles 22 and 23 @xcite .",
    "here we compare a reconstruction of tsi based on magnetograms and model atmospheres with the irradiance composites . since such reconstructions have turned out to be highly successful in reproducing the irradiance on the solar cycle time scale @xcite this comparison provides an independent test of the composites and in particular of whether any secular trends in the irradiance can be due to solar surface magnetic fields .",
    "the precent paper does not address the lower irradiance in the minimum between cycles 23 and 24 @xcite since the instruments that recorded the data on which the present reconstructions are based stopped operating in 2003 .",
    "we consider here three different composites , which are compiled from multiple , cross - calibrated independent radiometric measurements since 1978 november 16 .",
    "we use the newest pmod composite of tsi ( version 41 ) from the physikalisch - meteorologisches observatorium davos / world radiation center ( pmod / wrc ) in switzerland @xcite , the acrim composite @xcite and the irmb composite from the institut royal meteorologique belgique ( * ? ? ?",
    "* s. dewitte priv .",
    "the three composite time series are quite different in their longer term trends .",
    "the pmod composite has a negligible trend between the two solar minima of 1986 and 1996 ( cycles 22 and 23 ) and has lower tsi values at the three solar maxima of the cycles 21 , 22 and 23 than the other two composites @xcite .",
    "the acrim composite shows the largest difference between the 2 minima .",
    "it is important to note that the differences between the composites not only change gradually , but also display significant jumps .",
    "the tsi model employs sets of full - disk magnetograms in fei  8688  @xmath0 and continuum images obtained daily at the kitt peak vacuum tower ( kpvt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the national solar observatory ( nso ) .",
    "data recorded by the nasa / nso spectromagnetograph ( henceforth referred to as nso - spm ) between 1992 november 21 and 2003 september 21 and by the nasa / nso 512-channel diode array magnetograph ( henceforth referred to as nso-512 ) between 1978 november 16 and 1992 april 4 were used for irradiance reconstructions on a total of 3528 days .",
    "the nso-512 magnetograms need to be divided by a factor @xmath1 in order to make them compatible with the nso - spm data .",
    "the standard factor recommended by nso is @xmath2 .",
    "however @xcite have shown that different cross - calibration techniques give different factors between 1.38 and 1.63 .",
    "a detailed describtion of the data and their treatment is given by @xcite .",
    "we use the satire model ( spectral and total irradiance reconstructions , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) described by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is based on the assumption that all irradiance changes on time scales of a day and longer are caused by the evolving distribution of the magnetic field on the solar surface .",
    "it makes use of two elements : full disk data ( magnetograms for identifying bright magnetic features and continuum images for sunspots and pores ) and model atmospheres for each of these components .",
    "the model has a single free parameter , @xmath3 , the value of the magnetogram signal at which magnetic field in the solar photosphere fills the whole magnetogram pixel .",
    "@xmath3 is varied until the best representation of the full considered tsi composite is obtained .",
    "we have carried out two sets of tsi reconstructions , those using the standard @xmath1 value of 1.46 , called standard reconstructions ( discussed in sect .  [ sec : compstandard ] ) and those allowing @xmath1 to vary within the allowed range of 1.38 and 1.63 , called optimized reconstructions ( discussed in sect .  [ sec : compoptimal ] ) .",
    "a detailed describtion of the tsi model used here is given by @xcite .",
    "the length of the reconstructed time series is determined by the length of time for which the kitt peak magnetograms are available . for this study we decided against combining these reconstruction with those from mdi on soho , in order to maintain homogeneity in the reconstructed time series .",
    "a combination with mdi would have entailed employing conversion factors between kitt peak magnetograms and mdi magnetograms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would have introduced further uncertainty in the long - term trend .",
    "we now compare the reconstructed tsi with the three tsi composite records : pmod , acrim and irmb .      here",
    "we compare the standard reconstructions of tsi @xcite with all tsi composites .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] , which in the top panel displays the reconstructed tsi , while the lower panels show the difference between measured and reconstructed tsi for all three composites .",
    "the best agreement is achieved with the pmod composite ( second panel ) . not only is the scatter larger in the two lowermost panels , but also the slopes of the regression lines are noticeably larger , indicating a significant difference between the long - term trends of these composites and the reconstruction .",
    "the corresponding correlation coefficients , @xmath4 , between the reconstructed and measured irradiance , the slopes and @xmath5 of the linear regressions as well as the @xmath3 values are listed in table  [ tab : one ] under `` standard reconstructions '' .",
    "for all three composites we find that the correlation coefficient is lower for the nso-512 period than for the nso - spm period , probably due to the lower quality of the spm-512 magnetograms , but also of the early tsi data .",
    "the correlation coefficients obtained when comparing the reconstructions with the acrim and irmb composites are always significantly lower than those for the pmod compilation .",
    "this is true for all intervals of time considered , but is most striking for the full period .",
    "the acrim composite displays a difference of roughly @xmath6 between the minima of cycles 22 and 23 @xcite , while @xcite obtain a smaller difference of @xmath7 . on the other hand , both the pmod composite and the reconstructed irradiance show no trend significantly different from zero @xcite .",
    "the main reason for the differences during the period before acrim - i starts is that in the pmod composite @xcite corrects the data of the hickey - frieden ( hf ) radiometer on nimbus-7 for changes he attributes to an early increase , degradation and other long - term changes .",
    "next , all three lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] show a jump in 1984 which coincides with the repair of the solar maximum mission ( smm ) spacecraft and the re - start of the acrim i data .",
    "we can not rule out problems in the nso-512 magnetograms as the cause ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) , but the timing suggests that it could at least partly be due to a change of acrim i after its extended switch - off during the repair of smm .",
    "another obvious difference between the pmod and the other composites is seen during the gap between acrim i and ii .",
    "it is manifested as a very steep drop at the end of september 1989 .",
    "this is most likely due to a slip in hf which was already detected by @xcite by comparison with their earth radiation budget satellite ( erbs ) data and later by @xcite relative to their model . in the irmb",
    "composite the tracing of acrim ii to acrim i is performed with erbs data , which do not have the slip in september 1989 .",
    "this is responsible for the fact that the acrim i and ii differences to the model lie at the same level ( close to zero ) in the composite .",
    "the data during the acrim gap , however , are from hf and so obviously show that step .    also , between 1992 and 2003 with the more reliable nso - spm data the reconstructed tsi values agree best with the pmod composite ( second panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] and table  [ tab : one ] ) . during this period",
    "the acrim composite is generally higher than the reconstructed tsi .",
    "@xcite has removed steps in the tsi from the pmod composite in july 1992 and in march 1998 , that , he argued , were produced when the radiometers a and b of acrim ii were switched .",
    "no such compensation was made in the other composites .",
    "after 1996 , when the virgo data started , irmb uses a different method to determine the degradation corrections of diarad than underlies the pmod composite .",
    "next , we repeated the analysis , but now allowed @xmath1 to vary within the allowed range of 1.38 and 1.63 in order to optimise the reconstructions to the different composites .",
    "to best reproduce the pmod composite irradiance time series ( i.e. achieve the highest @xmath4 and lowest @xmath5 ) , we need a slightly higher @xmath1 of 1.6 compared with the official factor of 1.46 ( see column 3 of table  [ tab : one ] ) , whereas for the acrim and irmb composites a significantly higher factor of 2.0 is required , which lies well outside the allowed range ( 1.38 - 1.63 ) . within this allowed range",
    "we receive the best possible reproduction of the acrim and irmb composites using a factor of 1.63 .",
    "the correlation coefficients etc .  between the reconstructions and acrim and irmb composites",
    "are given in the lower half of table  [ tab : one ] .",
    "note that the correlation coefficients for the acrim and irmb composites are significantly lower in all of the three considered periods ( even for @xmath8 ) than for the pmod time series .",
    "we have compared the tsi reconstructed between 1978 and 2003 with three different composites of measured tsi ( pmod , acrim and irmb ) .",
    "our model , based on the assumption that the solar irradiance changes are entirely caused by the evolution of the solar surface magnetic fields , suggests similar levels of the solar irradiance during the three minima of the solar cycles 21 , 22 and 23 @xcite . with a single free parameter fixed for the whole period",
    ", the model reproduces the observed irradiance variations in all three cycles 21 , 22 and 23 as represented by the pmod composite .",
    "however , the reconstructed irradiance displays large deviations from the other two composites ( acrim and irmb ) , as can be judged from fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] and table  [ tab : one ] .",
    "this implies that any secular trend in the irradiance between 1978 and 2003 ( e.g. , found in the acrim and irmb composites ) can not be due to the surface magnetic field as sampled by ground - based magnetograms .",
    "such magnetograms do miss very small - scale fields in the quiet sun ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "the influence of these weak fields on irradiance , if any , still has to be etsablished .",
