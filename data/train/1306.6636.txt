    "with the advent of large photometric , spectroscopic and proper motion surveys of stars , it has now become possible to study in detail the properties of the milky way disc .",
    "substantial improvements in the richness and quality offered by these new surveys demands increasing sophistication in the methods used to analyze them @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the vast increase in the _ size _ of the new data sets requires that these same methods have greatly enhanced computational efficiency compared to existing algorithms .",
    "there is a pressing need for wholesale improvements to theoretical modelling in order to cope with the data deluge . in the context of modelling the kinematics of the disc , for simplicity ,",
    "3d gaussian functions have been used .",
    "this form is barely adequate for radial and vertical motions and entirely inappropriate for azimuthal motions .",
    "the azimuthal distribution of stellar motions , the subject of this paper , is very skewed because the surface density and radial velocity dispersions are declining functions of radius @xmath0 . at any given radius , we observe more stars with azimuthal velocity @xmath1 less than the local circular velocity @xmath2 than stars with @xmath3 , a phenomenon known as ` asymmetric drift ' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the inadequacy of the gaussian functions in modelling disc kinematics has been discussed by @xcite and @xcite .    a better way to model disc kinematics is to use a proper distribution function @xmath4 . for axisymmetric systems with potential @xmath5 ,",
    "the distribution function from jeans theorem is a function of energy @xmath6 and angular momentum @xmath7 alone , @xmath8 .",
    "however , there is no unique solution for a given @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "specifying @xmath10 can restrict the solution space but does not remove the general degeneracy , the reason being that a finite set of functions of one variable can not determine a function of two variables @xcite .",
    "one approach to arrive at a suitable @xmath11 as given by @xcite is to consider moderately heated ( ` warmed up ' ) versions of cold discs , i.e. f(e , l)=where @xmath12 is the energy of a circular orbit with angular momentum @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath13 is chosen such that in the limit @xmath14 , the function gives a surface density of @xmath9 .",
    "recently @xcite used this to derive important formulas for disc kinematics .",
    "forms of warm discs other than the shu family can be found in @xcite .",
    "further examples include the distribution functions for a quasi - isothermal disc described in @xcite .",
    "one problem with these warmed up functions is that they reproduce the target density only very approximately @xmath15 the larger the value of @xmath16 , the larger the discrepancy .",
    "one way to improve this is to iteratively solve for @xmath13 from the integral equation connecting @xmath9 and @xmath11 as suggested by @xcite . for applications like mcmc model fitting , where in each iteration the model parameters are changed and one has to recompute the solution ( sharma et al 2013 , in preparation )",
    ", existing algorithms are simply too inefficient .",
    "hence , in this paper we attempt to find an empirical formula for @xmath13 that reproduces a disc with exponential surface density .",
    "the form of @xmath13 in general depends on the choice of @xmath17 , so to proceed we assume @xmath17 to be an exponential function with two free parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 and then find an empirical formula for @xmath20 .",
    "the formula is shown to work for rotation curves whose dependence with radius is flat , rising and falling .",
    "additionally we also show that a similar formula can also be derived for one of the distribution function proposed by @xcite .",
    "finally , we present an extension of the formula for the case of velocity dispersion profiles that are exponential in radius .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the basic theory and the method to numerically compute the distribution function . using this in section 3 , we determine an empirical formula for the distribution function . in section 4 ,",
    "we analyze the accuracy of our results and compare it with alternate solutions .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we conclude and summarize our findings .",

    "the accuracy of the formula as a function of @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be better gauged in panels a and d of . here",
    "we plot the mean absolute fractional difference of surface density @xmath9 with respect to the target surface density @xmath161 as a function of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it can be seen that the proposed solution works quite well over most of the @xmath162 space except for very high values of @xmath18 .",
    "it should be noted that in the region @xmath163 , lower right corner , where the empirical formula fails the iterative solution also itself fails ( see panel d ) .",
    "so the actual inaccuracy of the formula is mainly confined to the region @xmath164 .",
    "we now study the accuracy of our analytic formula given by and for the case where both the target surface density and the velocity dispersion are specified to follow exponential forms .",
    "the mean absolute fractional difference of @xmath9 and @xmath10 with respect to @xmath165 and @xmath166 is shown in panels b and c of .",
    "for comparison , the panels e and f show the results of the iterative algorithm .",
    "it can be seen that the formula works well in the range @xmath167 , where the mean error is less than 1% .",
    "however for @xmath168 , the formula and the iterative solution both do not work well .",
    "it should be noted that the sharp transition at @xmath169 is due to the fact that we measure the difference over the range @xmath170 . extending the range would shift the transition value of @xmath18 to lower values and vice versa . in general , for a given @xmath18 the solution provided by the iterative method and the empirical formula are both accurate in reproducing target profiles for small values of @xmath0 , they gradually become inaccurate at larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "it can also be seen from the figure that for @xmath168 , the empirical formula performs slightly better than the iterative solution at reproducing the target surface densities . however , this is only at the expense of not matching the target velocity dispersion profiles as well .",
    "we now discuss the possible causes for the failure of the iterative solution for large @xmath18 .",
    "the iterative algorithm will only work correctly if the contribution to the integral for @xmath9 or @xmath10 ( see equation [ equ : integralequ1 ] and [ equ : integralequ2 ] ) , is confined to a local region around @xmath171 .",
    "in general , at large @xmath0 this condition is violated .",
    "the radius at which this violation occurs depends upon the choice of @xmath18 , and is lower for larger values of @xmath18 .",
    "this violation of the locality condition is stronger for @xmath10 profiles , as @xmath26 increases exponentially with decrease in @xmath24 .",
    "the rise in @xmath172 at large @xmath0 as discussed in and is also a manifestation of this effect .",
    "this is the main reason that when the constraint of exponential radial dispersion profiles is applied the algorithm fails for @xmath168 .     from the target surface density , @xmath137 , for @xmath173 .",
    "the thickness of the line is proportional to the value of @xmath174 used for @xmath175 .",
    "the dashed line is the result of using our empirical formula with @xmath176 .",
    "[ fig : f12],scaledwidth=48.0% ]      an alternative way to generate an exponential disc using a shu type distribution function was proposed in @xcite .",
    "they note that the effect of warming up the distribution function is to expand the disc , and this can be thought of as an increase in scale length of the disc .",
    "so , one way to take this into account is to start with a slightly smaller scale length when specifying @xmath44 .",
    "there are two problems with this approach .",
    "first , the factor by which the scale length will have to be reduced will depend upon the values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "so the solution is no simpler than what we propose .",
    "secondly , we find that even if one has the correct factor , the solution is less than optimal . to show this , we plot in the fractional difference of the surface density @xmath9 obtained using @xmath177 from an exponential surface density with different values of @xmath174 .",
    "we set @xmath178 and @xmath179 which is typical of old thin disc stars .",
    "the case considered is that of @xmath40 with flat rotation curve . it can be seen that increasing @xmath174 improves the solution slightly for @xmath180 , but at the expense of deteriorating it for large @xmath0 .",
    "overall , the quality of the fit is quite poor . for comparison ,",
    "the dashed line is the result using our empirical formula with @xmath181 , which clearly performs better .     from the target surface density , @xmath137 , for @xmath173 .",
    "shown are the results for the dehnen s ansatz with different scale length .",
    "the results of our empirical formula are also shown alongside .",
    "[ fig : f13],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    one might argue that the ansatz of @xcite f _ shu - dehnen(e , l)= ( ) [ equ : dehnen_ansatz ] actually produces discs that are more close to an exponential form , and so applying the @xcite scale length reduction to it might produce even better agreement .",
    "we now investigate this issue .",
    "firstly , the above distribution function is not normalized .",
    "if @xmath141 is parameterized in terms @xmath18 and @xmath19 as before then it has a normalization that depends upon the choice of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , so the full distribution function is not purely analytical anymore . on top of that",
    "as said earlier , the factor by which the scale length will have to be reduced will also depend upon the values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we assume it to be 10% for the time being . in , we show the fractional difference of surface density from the target density for the case of @xmath182 with flat rotation curve .",
    "results with normalization ( denoted by @xmath183 ) and with @xcite scale length reduction are also shown alongside .",
    "it can be seen that after normalizing the dehnen s ansatz does produce discs that match the target density better , i.e. , the range of deviation is smaller than the thin red line corresponding to @xmath184 in . after applying the @xcite scale length reduction",
    "the agreement gets even better , but only in regions with @xmath185 . for large @xmath0",
    ", there is still a wide discrepancy . in comparison",
    ", it can be seen that the formula proposed in this paper ( dashed blue line ) is still superior while being simpler and fully analytic .",
    "in this paper , we have presented an empirical formula for shu - type distribution functions which can reproduce with good accuracy a disc with an exponential surface density profile .",
    "this should be useful in constructing equilibrium n - body models of disc galaxies @xcite where such functions are employed .",
    "it can also be employed in synthetic milky way modelling codes like trilegal , galaxia @xcite and besancon . finally , the most important use of our new formalism is for mcmc fitting of theoretical models to large data sets , e.g. , the geneva - copenhagen , rave @xcite and segue stellar surveys @xcite .",
    "here , separable analytic approximations of this kind are required to make the problem tractable ( sharma et al 2013 , in preparation ) .",
    "one of our main finding is that the part of the distribution function that determines the target surface density can be written as the target density plus a correction term which approximately follows a unique functional form .",
    "so , the problem reduces to determining the scale and the amplitude of this correction function and their dependence on @xmath18 ( ratio of central velocity dispersion to circular velocity ) and @xmath19 ( a parameter controlling the gradient of the dispersion as a function of radius ) .",
    "the problem is further simplified as we find that the scale is primarily a function of only @xmath19 and the amplitude is a primarily a function of only @xmath18 .",
    "these findings are valid for not only flat rotation curves but also for cases with rising and falling rotation curves .",
    "additionally , it was also found to be valid for one of the @xcite distribution functions .",
    "an extension of the formula to reproduce velocity dispersion profiles that are exponential in radius was also found to work well .",
    "this suggests that the methodology presented can , in principle , be also applied to other disc distribution functions proposed by @xcite and @xcite which are conceptually similar .",
    "we are thankful to the anonymous referee who among other things motivated us to generalize our results .",
    "we are also thankful to james binney for his comments that led to a substantial improvement in the manuscript .",
    "jbh is funded through a federation fellowship from the australian research council ( arc ) .",

    "we consider here the distribution function f_dehnen , a & = & ( - ) from @xcite . for @xmath41 one can write the probability distribution in @xmath186 space as p(r , r_e , r_g)dr dr_e dr_g & = & 2f(e , l)dl dr 2d |v_r| + p(r , r_e , r_g ) & = & 2f(e , l ) to proceed further we assume a flat rotation curve .",
