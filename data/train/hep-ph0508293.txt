    "one of the most exciting prospects of particle physics is the discovery of the source of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "a single @xmath1 complex scalar doublet is responsible for both gauge boson masses ( via the higgs mechanism ) and fermion masses ( via yukawa interactions ) .",
    "the only scalar physical remnant of the process is the higgs boson ( @xmath2 ) whose mass is a free parameter of the model . in contrast , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) contains two complex @xmath1 scalar doublets , as required to give masses to both up- and down - type quarks and to cancel gauge anomalies . once ewsb occurs in the mssm , the scalar sector contains _ five _ physical higgs bosons : a light scalar @xmath3 , a heavy scalar @xmath4 , a pseudoscalar @xmath5 and a pair of charged bosons @xmath6 . finding experimental evidence for the existence of one or more higgs bosons is , thus , a major goal of current and future collider experiments .",
    "in addition , measuring the couplings of the higgs boson(s ) to gauge bosons , leptons and quarks would be imperative to uncover the true structure of the higgs sector .",
    "direct searches for higgs bosons at lep2 have placed lower mass limits on both the sm higgs ( @xmath7 114.4  gev at @xmath8 c.l . )  @xcite and the lightest scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons of the mssm ( @xmath9 93  gev at @xmath8 c.l . )",
    "in addition , the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson of the mssm is also bounded from above by theory to less than @xmath10 130  gev . finally",
    ", precision electroweak measurements , which are sensitive to the effects of higgs boson loop contributions , imply that the mass of the sm higgs boson should be less than @xmath10 186  gev at @xmath8 c.l .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath10 219  gev when including the lep-2 direct search limit ) .",
    "hence , in both the sm and the mssm , a higgs boson should lie in a mass range which can be explored at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "the dominant production mechanism for a sm higgs boson in hadronic interactions ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) is gluon fusion ( @xmath13 ) , which proceeds predominantly through a loop of top quarks . among the production modes with smaller rates , the associated production with electroweak gauge bosons ( @xmath14 , where @xmath15 ) or with top quark pairs ( @xmath16 ) , as well as weak boson fusion ( @xmath17 ) , play crucial roles .",
    "the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections have been calculated for all of the above processes  @xcite , while for gluon fusion and associated @xmath18 production corrections are also known at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in perturbative qcd  @xcite .    in the mssm",
    ", the hierarchy of production modes can be significantly different from that of the sm .",
    "in fact , for large values of @xmath0 ( the ratio of the two mssm higgs vacuum expectation values ) , the bottom quark yukawa couplings to both scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons become strongly enhanced and the production of higgs bosons with bottom quarks dominates over all other production modes .     and @xmath19 production at tree level . ]",
    "recently , the production of higgs bosons in association with bottom quarks has received much interest from both the theoretical and experimental communities  @xcite . at tree level , the cross section is almost entirely dominated by the sub - process @xmath20 , with only a small contribution from @xmath19 , at both the tevatron and lhc ( see fig .",
    "[ fg : ggbbh_feyn ] ) .",
    "the theoretical prediction of @xmath21 production at hadron colliders , however , involves several subtle issues , as will be described in detail in this review , and depends on the number of bottom quarks identified , or _",
    "tagged _ , in the final state . in case of no or only one tagged bottom quark there are two approaches available for calculating the cross sections to @xmath21 production , dubbed the four flavor ( 4fns ) and five flavor ( 5fns ) number schemes .",
    "the main difference between these two approaches is that the 4fns is a fixed - order calculation of qcd corrections to the @xmath22-induced @xmath21 production processes , while in the 5fns the leading processes are induced by @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 initial states and large collinear logarithms present at tree level as well as at each order of qcd corrections are resummed by using a pertubatively defined bottom quark parton distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "the two schemes are described in more detail in section  [ sec : fourfns ] and  [ sec : fivefns ] , respectively .     in the 5fns . ]     in the 5fns . ]    for purposes of differentiating the final states , we introduce the following terminology . _ exclusive _ @xmath21 production refers to the case when both bottom quark jets are tagged ( or are at high transverse momentum , @xmath26 ) .",
    "note that , in this case , the computation of the cross section solely relies on the 4fns .",
    "_ semi - inclusive _ production ( denoted by @xmath27 ) pertains to the case when _ at least _",
    "one bottom quark is at high @xmath26 . here , the dominant leading - order ( lo ) process for the 4fns ( 5fns ) is @xmath28 ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 , see fig .",
    "[ fg : bghb_feyn ] ) .",
    "finally , the _ inclusive _ production process ( denoted by @xmath31 ) involves the case where no bottom quark jets are tagged .",
    "the dominant lo process for this mode is @xmath32 ( @xmath33 , see fig .",
    "[ fg : bbh_feyn ] ) in the 4fns ( 5fns ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that , although the cross section for the inclusive production mode dominates over the less inclusive modes by one to two orders of magnitude , tagging bottom quark jets greatly reduces backgrounds , making the less inclusive modes experimentally more appealing .",
    "requiring one or two high-@xmath26 bottom quark jets in the final state also ensures that the detected higgs boson has been radiated off a bottom or anti - bottom quark and the corresponding cross section is unambiguously proportional to the bottom quark yukawa coupling .",
    "qcd corrected cross sections are available for all three final states and the inclusive and semi - inclusive production processes have been computed in both the 4fns and 5fns . for the inclusive case , the nlo qcd corrected 4fns  @xcite and the nnlo qcd corrected 5fns cross sections  @xcite have been compared and are found to be in good agreement within theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the nlo predictions of the semi - inclusive cross sections for the 4fns  @xcite and 5fns  @xcite have also been extensively compared  @xcite and the agreement between the two is spectacular .",
    "the compatibility of these two seemingly different calculational schemes in the prediction of inclusive and semi - inclusive higgs boson production rates is indeed a powerful check of the theory .",
    "the 4fns and 5fns represent different perturbative expansions of the same physical observables , and therefore should agree at sufficiently high order .",
    "indeed , we see that considering the first ( second ) order of corrections already brings agreement between the two schemes within the respective theoretical uncertainties . finally , two independent calculations of the nlo qcd corrections for the exclusive mode have been compared and agreement has been found  @xcite .    the above discussion for the production of a _ scalar _ higgs boson with bottom quarks applies equally well to the production of a _",
    "_ higgs boson .",
    "in fact , for massless bottom quarks , the predictions for @xmath34 would be identical to those of @xmath35 given a rescaling of the yukawa couplings . for massive bottom quarks , however , the situation becomes complicated due to the @xmath36 appearing in the @xmath34 yukawa coupling .",
    "the @xmath36 dirac matrix is intrinsically a four - dimensional object and care must be taken in its treatment when dimensionally regularizing the calculation . in any case , bottom quark mass effects are expected to be small , i.e. @xmath37@xmath38 , and predictions for @xmath35 are good indicators for @xmath34 production ( modulus yukawa couplings ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] , we discuss the framework of the calculations in the four- and five - flavor - number schemes in detail . given the importance it plays in the prediction of the cross section through the yukawa coupling",
    ", we also discuss different renormalization schemes of the bottom quark mass .",
    "section  [ sec : mssmcoups ] details the susy - corrected yukawa couplings obtained from the program feynhiggs  @xcite that were used in this study to produce results for mssm higgs bosons . in section  [ sec : numbers ] , we review the results for inclusive , semi - inclusive and exclusive higgs boson production with bottom quarks . in section  [ sec :",
    "pdfs ] , we investigate the uncertainties arising from the pdfs for the semi - inclusive @xmath21 production process .",
    "these uncertainties are calculated using the algorithm developed by the cteq collaboration  @xcite .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "final state bottom quarks are identified imposing cuts on their transverse momentum ( @xmath39 ) and pseudorapidity ( @xmath40 ) . on the other hand , when a final state bottom quark is not identified , as in the inclusive and semi - inclusive @xmath21 production processes , the corresponding integration over its phase space may give rise to large logarithms of the form : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 represent the lower and upper bounds on the integration over the transverse momentum , @xmath26 , of the final state bottom quark .",
    "this happens when the final state bottom quark is directly originating from the @xmath44 splitting of an initial state gluon , and corresponds to the collinear singularity that would be present in the case of a gluon splitting into massless quarks .",
    "the scale @xmath43 is typically of @xmath45 and therefore , due to the smallness of the bottom quark mass , these logarithms can be quite large . additionally , the same logarithms appear at every order in the perturbative expansion of the cross section in the strong coupling , @xmath46 , due to recursive gluon emission from internal bottom quark lines",
    ". these logarithms could severely hinder the convergence of the perturbative expansion of the total and differential cross sections . in the 5fns the convergence",
    "is improved by introducing a perturbatively defined bottom quark pdf  @xcite , defined at lowest order in @xmath46 as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the ( experimentally - measured ) gluon pdf and @xmath49 is the altarelli - parisi splitting function for @xmath50 given by @xmath51\\,\\,\\,.\\ ] ] subsequently , the @xmath52 logarithms are resummed through the dglap evolution equation  @xcite , such that contributions proportional to @xmath53 can be absorbed , to all orders in @xmath54 , into a leading logarithms bottom quark pdf , while subleading logarithms are recursively resummed when higher order corrections are considered in the dglap equation . since @xmath55 is not a small expansion parameter , the use of a bottom quark pdf should improve the stability of the total and differential cross sections for inclusive and semi - inclusive higgs boson production with bottom quarks .",
    "the 5fns is based on the approximation that any _ spectator _ bottom quarks ( i.e. , bottom quarks which are not tagged in the final state ) are at small transverse momentum , since this is the region where the @xmath52 logarithms dominate over other @xmath26-dependent contributions . at lowest order ,",
    "the spectator quarks are produced with zero @xmath26 , and a transverse momentum spectrum for the outgoing bottom quarks is generated at higher orders  @xcite .    with the use of a bottom quark pdf",
    ", the 5fns effectively reorders the perturbative expansion to be one in @xmath46 _ and _ @xmath56 . to see how this works ,",
    "let us consider the perturbative expansion of the inclusive process @xmath57 ( fig .",
    "[ fg : bbh_feyn ] ) , which is at tree level of order @xmath58 . at nlo ,",
    "the virtual and real corrections to the tree level process make contributions of @xmath59 .",
    "however , at nlo , we must also consider the contribution from @xmath29 where the final state bottom quark is at high @xmath26 .",
    "this process makes a contribution of order @xmath60 and is , thus , a correction of @xmath61 to the tree level cross section .",
    "similarly , at nnlo , among the myriad of radiative corrections of @xmath62 , we must also include the contribution from the process @xmath20 , where both @xmath63 and @xmath64 are at high @xmath26 .",
    "the contribution from these diagrams are of order @xmath65 , and are , thus , @xmath66 ( or nnlo ) corrections to the tree level process @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "the above discussion for @xmath33 also applies to the perturbative expansion of @xmath29 . in this case , the tree level process is of order @xmath67 and the contribution from @xmath20 is a nlo correction of @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "finally , we observe that , in the existing 5fns calculations , all bottom quark masses other than the one appearing in the yukawa coupling are set to zero .      in the 4fns",
    ", the initial state quarks are constrained to be the four lightest quarks , i.e. there are no bottom quarks in the initial state .",
    "no kinematic approximations are made and the cross section for @xmath69 is computed at fixed order in qcd without resumming higher - order collinear logarithms .",
    "moreover , the bottom quark mass is always considered to be non - zero .",
    "similarly to the 5fns , for the less inclusive final states discussed above ( @xmath27 or @xmath21 ) , identification cuts are imposed on the final state bottom quark(s ) which constrain its transverse momentum and pseudorapidity . applying these cuts to a final state bottom quark",
    "eliminates large logarithms that may appear from gluon splitting and it ensures that the bottom quark jets can be tagged experimentally . while the inclusive and semi - inclusive production of a higgs boson with bottom quarks can be calculated in both the 4fns and 5fns , the exclusive production can only be calculated in the 4fns , since both final state bottom quarks are tagged .",
    "the nlo qcd corrections to the hadronic process @xmath70 in the 4fns consist of calculating the @xmath71 virtual and real qcd corrections to the tree level ( partonic ) processes @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "we note that the nlo calculation of @xmath69 is identical to the calculation of the nlo qcd corrections to @xmath73  @xcite , with the global interchange of the top quark and bottom quark masses ( @xmath74 )",
    ".      one potential source of theoretical uncertainty in the calculation of @xmath69 involves the renormalization of the bottom quark mass .",
    "the bottom quark mass counterterm has to be used twice in the renormalization of the calculation : once to renormalize the bottom quark mass appearing in internal propagators and once to renormalize the sm bottom quark yukawa coupling @xmath75 , where @xmath76  gev .",
    "indeed , if one only considers qcd corrections , the counterterm for the bottom quark yukawa coupling coincides with the counterterm for the bottom quark mass , since the vacuum expectation value @xmath77 is not renormalized at 1-loop in qcd .",
    "the renormalization scheme dependence has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the 4fns , for the case of the exclusive @xmath78 production .",
    "two schemes for the renormalization of the bottom quark mass have been chosen : the @xmath79 scheme and an on - shell ( @xmath80 ) scheme .",
    "the two are perturbatively consistent at nlo with the only difference being at higher orders and , thus , part of the theoretical uncertainty of the nlo calculation .",
    "the main reason for investigating this renormalization scheme dependence is the large sensitivity of the @xmath79 bottom quark mass and the prominent role it plays in the @xmath21 production cross section through the overall bottom quark yukawa coupling .",
    "a summary of the results of this investigation are presented in section  [ subsec:2btag ] .",
    "the benefit of using the @xmath79 scheme for the yukawa coupling is that it potentially gives control over higher - order corrections beyond the 1-loop corrections .",
    "this is often reflected in the better perturbative behavior of physical observables calculated using the @xmath79 bottom quark yukawa coupling . therefore , unless otherwise stated all the results presented in this review are given using the @xmath79 scheme for the bottom quark mass and yukawa coupling .",
    "this is accomplished by replacing the @xmath79 bottom quark mass in the yukawa coupling with the corresponding 1-loop and 2-loop renormalization group improved @xmath79 masses : @xmath81^{c_0/b_0}\\,\\,\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath82^{c_0/b_0 } \\left [ 1+\\frac{c_0}{b_0}(c_1-b_1)\\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu)-\\alpha_s(m_b)}{\\pi } \\right ] \\left(1-\\frac{4}{3}\\frac{\\alpha_s(m_b)}{\\pi}\\right)\\,\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where we take the bottom quark pole mass to be @xmath83  gev and @xmath84 are the one and two loop coefficients of the qcd @xmath85 function and mass anomalous dimension @xmath86 , while @xmath87 is the number of colors and @xmath88 is the number of light flavors .",
    "so far , most of the results for @xmath21 production have been obtained in the sm , in order to simplify the comparison of different calculations and approaches ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as stated earlier , though , these processes are relevant discovery modes at hadron colliders only for susy models with large @xmath0 . therefore , we will present most of the following results for the case of the mssm with large @xmath0 .",
    "the prediction for the mssm case can easily be derived from the sm results by rescaling the yukawa couplings . in the 4fns , due to the existence of diagrams where the higgs is radiated off a closed top quark loop",
    ", some care must be taken when performing this rescaling . in this review",

    "first , the nominal set of pdfs ( e.g. cteq6 ) is constructed by fitting a _ non - perturbative core equation _ to data from low - energy experiments designed to measure pdfs .",
    "the core equation , in the method used by cteq , is parameterized by 20 independent parameters which are dialed to fit the data . once the nominal set is fixed , the 20 parameters are then varied in a well - defined manner to produce an additional 40 sets of pdfs .",
    "these sets serve as a _ map _ of the neighborhood around the nominal fit to the data . indeed",
    ", one can then use the 40 sets to estimate the uncertainty from the pdfs on a physical observable in the following way  @xcite : first , the central value cross section @xmath158 is calculated using the global minimum pdf ( i.e. cteq6 m ) .",
    "the calculation of the cross section is then performed with the additional 40 sets of pdfs to produce 40 different predictions , @xmath159 . for each of these",
    ", the deviation from the central value is calculated to be @xmath160 when @xmath161 .",
    "finally , to obtain the uncertainties due to the pdfs the deviations are summed quadratically as @xmath162 and the cross section including the theoretical uncertainties arising from the pdfs is quoted as @xmath163 . recently , similar analyses have been performed for the dominant sm higgs production modes  @xcite and for the fully inclusive higgs production modes in both the sm ( @xmath164 ) and the mssm ( @xmath165 )  @xcite .    in figs .",
    "[ fg : tevpdf ] and  [ fg : lhcpdf ] we plot the total sm nlo cross section for @xmath29 obtained with mcfm  @xcite at the tevatron and lhc respectively . here , we compare the spread uncertainties from residual scale dependence and the pdfs both for the total cross section ( top ) and the total cross section normalized to the central value calculated with cteq6 m ( bottom ) .    from fig .",
    "[ fg : lhcpdf ] one can see that , at the lhc , the theoretical uncertainty is dominated by the residual scale dependence . due to the large center of mass ( c.o.m . )",
    "energy of the lhc , the gluons and bottom quarks in the initial state have small momentum fraction ( @xmath166 ) values and , hence , small pdf uncertainties typically in the 5 - 10% range .",
    "in contrast , due to the smaller c.o.m .",
    "energy , the pdf uncertainties at the tevatron ( fig .",
    "[ fg : tevpdf ] ) are comparable and even larger than the uncertainties due to residual scale dependence over the full higgs mass range .",
    "the smaller c.o.m .",
    "energy results in higher-@xmath166 gluons and bottom quarks in the initial state which corresponds to large pdf uncertainties in the 10 - 30% range .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fg : ggvbg ] , we plot the normalized total sm nlo cross sections of @xmath29 and @xmath167 and compare their respective uncertainties due to the pdfs . we see that , at both the tevatron and the lhc , the pdf uncertainties are almost identical for both the @xmath168 and @xmath23 initial states .",
    "we discussed the status of theoretical predictions for higgs boson production in association with bottom quarks for the cases where zero , one or both outgoing bottom quarks are identified .",
    "these processes are important higgs boson discovery modes in models with enhanced bottom quark yukawa couplings , such as the mssm at large values of @xmath0 .",
    "we presented results for the mssm @xmath21 ( @xmath169 ) total and differential production rates at @xmath131 and discussed the theoretical uncertainties of the state - of - the - art predictions due to the residual renormalization / factorization scale dependence at nlo ( nnlo ) in qcd and the uncertainty in the pdfs .",
    "we have shown that the total cross section for the inclusive case , @xmath170 , and both the total and differential cross sections for the semi - inclusive case , @xmath171 , within a 4fns and 5fns are fully compatible within the existing theoretical errors . all important higgs production processes at hadron colliders are now known at nlo , and some even at nnlo , and the theoretical uncertainties of the qcd predictions are well under control .",
