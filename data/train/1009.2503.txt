    "the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) is the total dust emission from all galaxies in the universe .",

    "the main evidence is that the sed of the ( sub)mm background is less steep than the sed of a representative ( sub)mm galaxy ; the shallow slope of the background can be due to high redshift galaxies , so that the peak of their infrared sed shifts to observed ( sub)mm wavelengths @xcite . in this paper",
    "we address the question : ` what galaxies are responsible for the cib at @xmath6@xmath0 mm , and what is their redshift distribution ?

    "to resolve the @xmath7@xmath8@xmath0 mm background , we rely on a stacking analysis of galaxies detected at other wavelengths .",
