    "observations of galaxy populations at different redshifts indicate that the red sequence has roughly doubled in mass from z @xmath7 1 to 0 , while the mass in the blue cloud remains relatively unchanged ( bell et al .",

    "gravitational interactions between galaxies can influence their star formation rate ( sfr ) , gas content , and morphology .",
    "as such , they can increase the mass of star - forming galaxies , and be an important mechanism causing the evolution of blue , star - forming galaxies into red and dead galaxies .",
    "slow interactions that result in mergers will have a stronger impact on galaxy properties ( but see moore et al .",
    "1996 for a discussion of the possible impact of many quick galaxy interactions ) .",
    "dry mergers between gasless galaxies can also cause the hierarchical build - up of massive red galaxies .",
    "galaxy - galaxy interactions may drive the evolution of blue galaxies into red galaxies by causing a burst of star formation that may exhaust the gas in the merging pair and result in a more massive red galaxy .",
    "larson & tinsley ( 1978 ) identified interacting galaxies as peculiar galaxies , and determined that many of these galaxies had recently undergone a burst of star formation . shortly thereafter , a number of observers found bursts of star formation associated with tidal interactions ( e.g. condon et al .",
    "1982 ; keel et al . 1985",
    "; kennicutt et al .",
    "since then there has been much more observational work verifying and expanding on these results .",
    "for example , park et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find that tidal effects can accelerate the consumption of gas in galaxies and transform late types into early types .",
    "in addition , the level of star formation rate enhancement increases for closer pairs ( e.g. alonso et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ; ellison et al .",
    "2008 ) , more gas - rich pairs ( nikolic et al . 2004 ; woods & geller 2007 ) , and more evenly matched mass - ratio pairs ( woods & geller 2007 ; ellison et al .",
    "2008 ; but also see nikolic et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "in addition to an increase in the total mass of red systems over time , there is also evidence of an environmental dependence of the red to blue galaxy ratio .",
    "since about z @xmath7 0.4 red galaxies have dominated the galaxy populations of dense regions , such as clusters ( butcher & oemler 1978 ) .",
    "cooper et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , using the deep2 galaxy redshift survey , find that the red fraction is higher in regions of high density to beyond a redshift of 1 .",
    "if galaxy mergers are the main way to quench star formation and turn galaxies from blue to red , then it might be expected that pairs would be found in or near groups and clusters in order to match the morphology - density and colour - density relations ( oemler 1974 ; dressler 1980 ) .",
    "lin et al . ( 2010 ) examine the local densities in which wet , dry and mixed mergers occur and find that they broadly agree with the predictions of the colour - density relation .",
    "using simulations , barton et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that a higher fraction of close pairs than of the unpaired galaxy population lie in dark matter halos containing more than two galaxies .",
    "if these pairs merge , then this supports the idea that mergers are an important process driving the colour - density relation .",
    "although in this paper we will only focus on the interactions between bound galaxies , it is important to note that the colour - density and morphology - density relations may also be caused by a number of other possible interactions .",
    "in addition to pair interactions , galaxies in groups and clusters can undergo a number of fast interactions with other satellite galaxies , resulting in galaxy harassment ( moore et al .",
    "a galaxy can also interact with the cluster potential , which can strip material from the galaxy or induce star formation ( merritt 1984 ; byrd & valtonen 1990 ) .",
    "finally , a galaxy can interact directly with the intracluster medium , which can remove gas through ram pressure stripping ( gunn & gott 1972 ) , thermal evaporation ( cowie & songaila 1977 ) , kelvin - helmholtz instabilities ( chandrasekhar 1961 ) , or viscous stripping ( nulsen 1982 ) .",
    "many of these processes could also only cause starvation , or the removal of halo gas , which will slowly redden a galaxy as it exhausts its gas reservoir through star formation ( larson , tinsley & caldwell 1980 ) .",
    "while the mechanisms described above depend on a dense environment to affect individual galaxies , the opposite may be true for mergers .",
    "the high velocity dispersion in clusters makes them unfriendly environments for pairs ( e.g. ostriker 1980 ; makino & hut 1997 ) , and it has been proposed that  pre - processing \" of galaxies before they enter clusters can cause the morphology - density relation ( zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ; zabludoff 2002 ; mihos 2004 ) .",
    "for example , galaxies in groups and field pairs can undergo slower encounters that are more likely to result in mergers .",
    "moss ( 2006 ) observe galaxies in 8 low - redshift clusters , and find that 50 - 70% of the infall population was interacting or showed a disturbed morphology indicating a recent merger .",

    "( 2009 ) , using a somewhat different method , examine 53 clusters in dark - matter only n - body simulations and find that 70% of galaxies with total masses above 10@xmath10 m@xmath9 fall into clusters with no companions .",

    "( 2007 ) examine isolated close pairs and find that sfr can be boosted by a factor of 30 .",

    "specifically , perez et al . ( 2006a ) find a higher fraction of active galaxies in pairs in all environments , but the largest difference when comparing the fraction of actively star - forming galaxies is in low-@xmath14 regions ( @xmath11 0.8 mpc@xmath15 ) .",
    "they claim that this indicates that galaxy - galaxy interactions help establish the colour - density relation .",
    "they also find that the stellar populations in paired galaxies are more metal - enriched than non - paired galaxies ( perez et al . 2006b ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the observations by kewley et al .",

    "in this paper we use a cosmological simulation to examine the role of pairs and tidal interactions on galaxy colour , sfr , and gas mass .",

    "this gives us a broad range of local environments to study as well as two extreme large - scale environments .",
    "we consider the galaxy populations at five redshifts : 0.0 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.15 , and 0.2 .",
    "this increases our sample size , makes sure that any anomalies at a single redshift snapshot do not dominate the results , and checks to see if there is evolution in the pair population across these later redshifts . choosing this redshift range",
    "also allows for better comparisons with recent observational work on this topic using sdss ( e.g. patton et al .",
    "also , when we determine distances between galaxies , and use a distance criteria to determine the local galaxy density , we use the physical distance rather than the comoving distance .",
    "our goal in this paper is to determine under what conditions being a member of a pair or group affects galaxy properties .",
    "we examine this question in the context of the larger scale environment of the galaxies .    after an introduction to our simulation ( section [ sec : boxes ] )",
    ", we discuss our galaxy selection technique and our method for determining observable quantities for each galaxy in section [ sec : galaxyselection ] . in section [ sec : projpairs ] we examine the reliability of observational techniques used to identify pairs .",
    "we then explain our method for finding gravitationally bound pairs in our simulation ( section [ sec : bounddef ] ) . in section [ sec : pairdemographics ] we describe the demographics of bound galaxies , including where they are in relation to the cluster or void and their local density (  [ sec : wherepair ] ) .",
    "we also consider the colour of galaxies in pairs (  [ sec : wdm ] ) .",
    "we then determine whether bound galaxies are different than the general galaxy population in terms of their ssfr and gas mass in section [ sec : comparisons ] .",

    "for details of our simulations , we refer the reader to cen ( 2010 ) , although for completeness we reiterate the main points here .",

    "we first ran a low resolution simulation with a periodic box of 120 @xmath3 mpc on a side , and identified two regions : one centred on a cluster and one centred on a void at @xmath27 .",
    "we then resimulated each of the two regions separately with high resolution , but embedded within the outer 120 @xmath3 mpc box to properly take into account large - scale tidal field effects and appropriate fluxes of matter , energy and momentum across the boundaries of the refined region .",
    "the cluster refined region , or c box , is 21 @xmath16 24 @xmath16 20 @xmath17 mpc@xmath18 .",

    "star particles are created in cells that satisfy a set of criteria for star formation proposed by cen & ostriker ( 1992 ) , and supernovae feedback is included ( cen et al . 2005 ) .",
    "each star particle has a mass of @xmath710@xmath33 m@xmath29 , which is similar to the mass of a coeval globular cluster .",
    "we use hop ( eisenstein & hut 1998 ) to identify galaxies using the stellar particles .",
    "this has been tested and is robust using reasonable ranges of values ( e.g. tonnesen , bryan , & van gorkom 2007 ) . in order to choose only well - resolved galaxies",
    ", we only consider those galaxies with a stellar mass greater than 10@xmath34 m@xmath29 . in the c box , this leaves 61% of the originally identified galaxies , and in the v box this leaves 49% of the galaxies .",
    "we also demand that all of the dark matter particles in each galaxy be highly refined  so each galaxy must have resided in the refined region since the beginning of the simulation . in table",
    "[ tbl - pairs ] , we show the number of galaxies above our minimum mass at each output in each box , and see that this number tends to decrease with decreasing redshift .",
    "while the fraction of galaxies with m@xmath35 @xmath36 10@xmath34 m@xmath29 is highest in the z = 0 boxes , the number of galaxies that began in the refined region and have stayed in the refined region has decreased . in the c box",
    ", this is due to both mergers and galaxies leaving the refined region , while the underdensity of the v box results in galaxies leaving the refined region .",
    "we plotted projections of the star particles of each of these galaxies in order to verify first that hop was identifying galaxy - like objects ( with a density peak ) , and second , that hop was not grouping multiple galaxies together . in both the cluster and void boxes , only a few of the galaxies above our minimum mass that hop identified had density profiles without a strong density peak , eliminating 8 galaxies in the c box and 7 galaxies in the v box over all the redshift outputs .",
    "in addition , in the c box 47 hop - identified galaxies in fact had two density peaks , and one had three  galaxies \" . in the void box a total of 13 hop - identified galaxies had two density peaks .",
    "both of these problems add up to a misidentification of only 2% in each box .    if we treat multiple density peaks in hop - identified galaxies as multiple galaxies , we have 4858 galaxies above the minimum mass constituting our  total \" galaxy population over all redshift outputs ( c box z = 0.0 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.15 , and 0.2 for a total c box galaxy population of 3324 ; v box z = 0.0 , 0.05 , 0.15 , and 0.2 for a total v box population of 1534 ) .",
    "all of the hop - identified galaxies with multiple density peaks make up our hop multi - peak sample ( hop has combined multiple galaxies into one ) .",
    "we will discuss each of the galaxy pairs from the hop multi - peak sample as if observers would identify them as mid - merger or strongly interacting pairs ( we do not include the largest cluster cd galaxy in any of our pair samples , including the hop multi - peak sample ) .",
    "these galaxies are likely to be observationally identified as interacting for the same reason that hop identifies them as a single galaxy ",
    "they have either a small gap between or overlapping stellar populations , and frequently have tidal streams connecting the galaxies .",
    "the high - density stellar cores of the galaxies are within about 30 kpc of one another .",
    "we also checked the velocities of these galaxies and find that they are gravitationally bound and not simply close passes .",

    "in particular , cen ( 2011 ) compares the evolution of the sfr density from the c and v runs to observations and finds strong agreement .",
    "cen ( 2011 ) also compares the sdss r - band galaxy luminosity function at z = 0 to observations and finds excellent agreement at m@xmath37 @xmath36 -22 .",
    "we do overproduce large galaxies , and including agn feedback can bring the luminosity function into agreement even at high luminosities ( as shown in figure 3 of cen ( 2011 ) ) .    in the top panel of figure [ fig - colourhist ] ,",
    "we plot the colour distribution of our total galaxy sample ( recall our  total galaxy sample \" is composed of all galaxies with m@xmath38 @xmath36 10@xmath34 m@xmath29 ) .",
    "we see that there is a bimodal distribution of colours as in observations , and the total range of @xmath39 colours in our simulations is similar to the observed range of galaxy colours ( e.g. blanton et al . 2003 ; patton et al .",
    "2011 ) . however , the blue peak is slightly bluer ( about 0.05 - 0.1 magnitudes ) and the red peak is about 0.1 magnitudes bluer than in blanton et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and our distribution is narrower ( particulary on the red end of the distribution ) .    in the bottom panel of figure [ fig - colourhist ] , we plot the two - dimensional histogram of galaxy colour and mass .",
    "again , we see the bimodal distribution of the panel above , and we also see that our bluest galaxies tend to be low - mass , and our high - mass galaxies are redder than low - mass galaxies , in broad agreement with observations ( baldry et al . 2004 ) . this mass - colour relation has begun to be understood in a cosmological context by considering the gas properties of galaxy halos : high stellar mass galaxies have higher mass halos containing hot gas that either cools slowly before it can form stars , or can not radiatively cool to form stars , while galaxies in low - mass halos are able to directly accrete cold gas that can quickly form stars ( e.g. dekel & birnboim 2006 ; kere et al .",
    "the ratio of the number of galaxies in the blue cloud to that on the red sequence depends on the uncertain weightings for the c and v boxes , making a direct comparison to observations difficult . in the bottom panel of figure [ fig - colourhist ]",
    "we see that there are a few unrealistically large galaxies ",
    "these are mainly at the centre of our cluster or at the centres of groups .",
    "the inclusion of agn feedback , as mentioned above and in cen ( 2011 ) , would largely mitigate this discrepancy between our simulations and observations .",
    "we can partially explain the differences between the colour distribution of our sample from z = 0 to z = 0.2 to the blanton et al .",
    "( 2003 ) observations ( at z = 0.1 ) by comparing the histograms from the z = 0 ( orange line ) and z = 0.2 ( purple line ) outputs .",
    "the z = 0.2 output is bluer at both peaks , and contains more galaxies ( see also table [ tbl - pairs ] ) .",
    "we expect our ( large ) galaxies to become more red with time , as cold gas can no longer be accreted by galaxies as they grow or enter larger halos or overdense large - scale structure ( cen 2011 ) .",
    "the fact that both blue and red galaxies were bluer in the past has been observed ( e.g. blanton 2006 , although for a larger redshift range ) . in addition",
    ", these differences may be in part due to the fact that we do not include dust reddening for our galaxies , in part because we do not include all of the physical processes that could affect the colours of these galaxies ( such as feedback from agn and sn ia ) , and perhaps in a large part because our total galaxy sample ( across both the c and v boxes ) is not necessarily equal to the global average sample .",
    "for these reasons we will focus mainly on comparative studies within our simulations , which should be much less dependent on these uncertainties .",
    "kreckel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) closely examine galaxies in the same v box as our simulation , and in fact we use the void centre point that they identified .",
    "their work differs from ours in that they have one fewer level of refinement ( two times less resolution ) , and use somewhat different criteria in their hop galaxy identification .",
    "this results in differences of less than a factor of two in the measured properties of our populations . by far",
    "the biggest difference is that they include galaxies well below our lower mass limit in their analysis .",
    "the luminosity of each stellar particle in each of the five sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) bands is computed using the gissel stellar synthesis code ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) , by supplying the formation time , metallicity and stellar mass .",
    "collecting luminosity and other quantities of member stellar particles , gas cells and dark matter particles yields the following physical parameters for each galaxy : position , velocity , total mass , stellar mass , gas mass , mean formation time , mean stellar metallicity , mean gas metallicity , star formation rate , and luminosities in the five sdss bands .",
    "in this paper we will compare our results to observational trends in order to gain physical insight into what causes pairs to be different from galaxies without a bound companion .",
    "it is worthwhile first to ask whether observers are in fact picking out real pairs since they do not have real - space three dimensional information . in order to determine whether the observational selection criteria for pairs actually choose galaxies that are close to one another and/or that are gravitationally bound to one another , we choose  projected pairs \" using a few sets of criteria used in recent observational work .",
    "the least stringent criterion for choosing projected pairs is from perez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who use a projected distance ( r@xmath40 ) of less than 100 kpc @xmath3 and relative line - of - sight velocities @xmath41v @xmath42 350 km s@xmath25 .",
    "we also use two criteria from patton et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who use a relative line - of - sight velocity criterion of @xmath41v @xmath42 200 km s@xmath25 , and a r@xmath40 upper limit of either 60 kpc @xmath3 or 30 kpc @xmath3 .",
    "we choose projected pairs using the x - y , x - z , and y - z planes in our simulation for both our c box and v box , and the velocity difference perpendicular to the plane as our line of sight velocity . in table",
    "[ tbl - projpairs ] we show the number of pairs we find for each selections criterium across all projections and all redshifts .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      for discussion . ]    in figure [ fig - wdmhists ] we plot the histograms of the wet ( blue ) , mixed ( green ) , and dry ( red ) pairs as a function of distance from the cluster centre or void centre , and of local galaxy density . both the clustercentric distance and local density of the major member of the pair",
    "are used to represent those of the pair . for this reason it is easy to pick out the two largest groups in the c box in the middle panel  at about 8 @xmath3 mpc and 9 - 9.8 @xmath3 mpc from the cluster centre .",
    "one of them has a red central galaxy and therefore the pairs are either dry or mixed ( at @xmath7 9.8 @xmath3 mpc ) , and the other has a blue central galaxy so the pairs are either wet or mixed ( at @xmath7 8 @xmath3 mpc ) .",
    "the group with the blue central galaxy has more blue galaxies , and the group with the red central galaxy has more red galaxies ( seen in the top two panels of figure [ fig - wdmhists ] ) .",
    "this colour conformity is consistent with the galactic conformity observed in weinmann et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , that the morphology of the central galaxy in a halo is correlated with the morphology of the satellite galaxies ( this was recently examined in terms of gas availability in kauffmann et al .",
    "2010 ) .    ignoring these two groups",
    ", we can see that dry pairs are closer to the cluster centre , in general agreement with the colour - density relation .",
    "wet and mixed pairs are spread much more evenly in distance from the cd , although there are very few wet pairs within the virial radius of the cluster ( 1.3 @xmath3 mpc ) , and no wet pairs within the virial radius at z @xmath43 0.05 . in the v box ( the lowest panel ) , there are no pairs within 10 @xmath3 mpc of the void centre , and no mixed pairs until nearly 20 @xmath3 mpc from the void centre .",
    "the number of pairs increases with distance from the void centre until we reach the edge of the v box .    if we consider the local galaxy density of the pairs in the upper panel of figure [ fig - wdmhists ] , we can more easily pick out the group with the red central galaxy , which has a local density of about 10 @xmath44 mpc@xmath45 . at later times ( at z@xmath430.05 ) , both groups have this local density .",
    "however , at earlier times the red group has even higher local densities and the blue group has lower local densities .",
    "focusing on the rest of the pairs , we see that wet pairs reach the lowest local densities ( @xmath46 0.005 ) .",
    "we also find that dry pairs are rare outside of group environments ( @xmath47 3 ) , although we might find more dry pairs if we had a larger red galaxy population ( if , for example , we included agn feedback , see section [ sec : galaxyselection ] ) .",
    "our overall finding is that , while all three types of pairs can occur in groups , dry pairs are extremely rare in field environments .",
    "if pairs end in mergers , the following physical picture emerges : dry mergers should occur only in group or cluster environments , while wet and mixed mergers can occur at all local galaxy densities .",
    "wet mergers will dominate at the lowest local densities ( @xmath47 0.1 ) . at the other environmental extreme ,",
    "dry mergers dominate within the virial radius of a cluster .",

    "in this section we compare properties of pair galaxies ( we define pairs in section [ sec : bounddef ] to be galaxies bound to at least one other galaxy  excluding the cd in our largest cluster ) to those of the entire galaxy population .",
    "first consider the stellar mass of the galaxies .",
    "we find that , on average , the stellar mass of bound galaxies is larger than that of the total population at a fixed local density .",
    "this is true whatever subset of bound galaxies we consider ( all pairs , d @xmath42 500 @xmath3 kpc , d @xmath42 250 @xmath3 kpc , or the hop multi - peak sample ) . because galaxy mass may have a strong influence on galaxy properties ( visvanathan & sandage 1977 ; schweizer & seitzer 1992 ; blanton et al .",
    "2003 ; baldry et al . 2004 ; and see figure [ fig - colourhist ] ) , we performed all of our analysis twice : once with the entire galaxy sample as our control , and once using a sample that was matched to the stellar mass distribution of the bound sample .",
    "each bound sample was separately matched , therefore the comparison samples are not identical .",
    "after going through this process we find that the differences between the pair and total samples are somewhat smaller when we match stellar mass , although the sign remains the same . in this section , we will present our results using the entire galaxy sample for comparison .",
    "galaxy colour is often used as a proxy for star formation rate ( see the references in the introduction ) .",
    "we have considered both the colour and specific sfr ( ssfr @xmath48 sfr / m@xmath35 ) , and find analogous results when comparing pairs to the total population .",
    "therefore we will focus on the ssfr , as it is a more fundamental parameter and calculated directly in the simulation , whereas colour is subject to other less well modeled processes , such as dust reddening .",
    "we will now discuss the differences in the ssfr between the pair and the total galaxy population . as we discussed in section [",
    "sec : galaxyselection ] , we will compare trends we find in our simulations to observational trends rather than attempt to directly compare our simulated galaxies to observed galaxy populations .",
    "in figure [ fig - ssfr ] we plot the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the ssfr of different subsets of the simulated galaxies .",
    "the dash - dotted lines remain the same in all six panels , describing the total galaxy population in the c box ( red ) , v box ( blue ) and including the total combined population in the c and v boxes ( black ) .",
    "overlaid on these curves we plot the cdfs of bound galaxies , with each panel showing a different subset . to make the distributions of the higher ssfr galaxies more clear , we zoom in on the high ssfr end in the bottom panels .",
    "+     the ssfr distributions of the total galaxy populations in the two boxes differ .",
    "the v galaxies have a much higher fraction of high ssfr galaxies , although the maximum ssfr in both boxes is very similar .",
    "about 35% more of the galaxies in the v box have ssfr @xmath36 10@xmath49 yr@xmath25 than in the c box . clearly ssfr ( and therefore galaxy colour ) depends on environment , a point we will return to in section [ sec : env ] .",
    "note that the bound ( and to a lesser extent , the total galaxy ) cdfs are dominated by the c box galaxies , given the numbers shown in table [ tbl - pairs ] .",
    "focusing on the bound galaxies , we see that the cdf tilts towards higher ssfr as we move from the entire bound sample to subsets with distance cuts .",
    "this is largely due to changes in the cdf of the c box in the low ssfr end ( @xmath42 5 @xmath16 10@xmath49 ) . in the lower panels ,",
    "it is clear that there is very little change in the distribution of higher ssfr galaxies between the c box total bound population ( 0.9@xmath50w@xmath50 @xmath36 k ) and the c box bound population with d @xmath42 250 @xmath3 kpc .    if we focus on the v box , we find that the bound galaxy distribution appears very similar to that of the total v galaxy population , but with slightly more galaxies at both the high and low ssfr ends .",
    "in contrast to the c box galaxies discussed above , the ssfr distribution of the low ssfr v box bound galaxies varies very little as we consider only pairs with small separations ( @xmath72% at 10@xmath49 yr@xmath25 ) .",
    "the most noticeable change in the v pair cdfs is a larger fraction of high ssfr galaxies ( + 5% at 10@xmath51 yr@xmath25 ) .",
    "the hop multi - peak sample has a clearly larger high ssfr fraction than the total population for both the c and v boxes , although it is more pronounced in the v box .",
    "the ssfrs in these strongly interacting galaxies are among the highest of the total galaxy population .",
    "there are also galaxies with low ssfrs in the hop multi - peak sample , indicating that being a member of a strongly interacting pair does not necessarily lead to strong star formation .",
    "when we match this sample for stellar mass we see the exact same trends .",
    "tidal interactions may be causing a substantially higher fraction of hop multi - peak galaxies to have high ssfrs than pairs with larger separations . of course , companion - induced interactions are not the only cause of blue galaxies with high ssfrs ; in fact , the galaxy with the highest ssfr ( 1.75 @xmath16 10@xmath52 yr@xmath25 ) is not bound to any other galaxy .",
    "quantitatively , among the 39 galaxies with the highest ssfrs ( @xmath53 3 @xmath16 10@xmath54 yr@xmath25 ) , we find only 8 of them to be members of the bound d @xmath42 250 @xmath3 kpc , 6 to be a member of the hop multi - peak sample , and 1 to have been a member of the hop multi - peak sample in the previous output ( and therefore likely to have just merged ) . in figure [ fig - ssfr ]",
    "we find red hop multi - peak galaxies with low ssfrs that span the entire stellar mass range and the entire range of mass ratios in the hop multi - peak sample .",
    "to briefly summarize , we find a slightly higher fraction of low ssfr bound galaxies than that of the total sample ( compare the black dash - dotted line to the black solid line in the first panel of figure [ fig - ssfr ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with patton et al .",
    "including any distance cut results in a pair population with higher ssfr .",
    "this is at least partly because the distance cuts remove more group galaxies , which are likely to have lower ssfr ( and therefore be redder ) due to the dense environment in which they reside .",
    "we find a larger population of high ssfr ( extremely blue ) galaxies in the hop multi - peak pairs than in the total sample , which qualitatively agrees with the results of patton et al .",
    "we do not find a larger fraction of low ssfr ( extremely red ) galaxies using any of our pair samples .",
    "in addition to determining whether star formation is affected by being a member of a pair or group , we now investigate whether the cold gas mass of bound galaxies is different from the total population .",
    "as mentioned in section 2.1 , the h@xmath6 density is directly followed within the simulation .",
    "we consider the h@xmath6 gas fraction in figure [ fig - smhi ] , as it tells us about the fuel available for star formation in these galaxies .",
    "we use the h@xmath6 gas mass within one virial radius .",

    "linestyles are as in figure [ fig - ssfr ] .",
    "see section [ sec : sfrgas ] for discussion . ]    in the c box , the h@xmath6 gas fraction for all pairs has a similar distribution to the general c population .",
    "it is notable that close pairs have a higher fraction ( 70% vs 60% ) of somewhat h@xmath6 gas rich galaxies ( m@xmath55/m@xmath35 @xmath53 10@xmath45 ) than the total c population .",
    "it is equally interesting to note that the fraction of pairs ( @xmath74% ) with high h@xmath6 mass fractions ( m@xmath55/m@xmath35 @xmath53 0.1 ) appears little changed by being a pair member or a close pair member . as in the c box ,",
    "v box pairs have a very similar h@xmath6 gas fraction to the general v population .",
    "however , unlike the c box pairs , bound pairs in the v box with smaller separations ( d @xmath42 250 @xmath3 kpc ) have a dramatically higher fraction of extremely h@xmath6 rich galaxies : 20% of close pairs have m@xmath55/m@xmath35 @xmath53 1 , whereas only 4 - 5% of galaxies in the total v population or the entire v pair population have m@xmath55/m@xmath35 @xmath53 1 .",
    "overall , we find that galaxies in closer pairs have higher m@xmath55 gas fractions than the general population : the p values for the ks tests comparing the bound galaxies to either the total or the mass - matched sample are below 0.1 for all pairs with d @xmath42 500 @xmath3 kpc .",
    "this indicates that close interactions increase cold gas formation via gravitationally induced hydrodynamical effects and radiative cooling .",
    "observations indicate that galaxy interactions can cause inflows in ionized gas ( rampazzo et al .",
    "2005 ) and neutral gas ( e.g. hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , observations find that interacting galaxies have lower metallicities in the central regions and have lower metallicity gradients in the disc ( kewley et al .",
    "2006 ; kewley et al . 2010 ) .",
    "together these findings indicate that low metallicty gas inflows come from outer regions of the halo to the disk and central galaxy .",
    "recall from figure [ fig - ssfr ] that the fraction of higher - ssfr galaxies does not start to increase until we focus on the hop multi - peak sample .",
    "this may mean that gas is cooling from the halo in the d @xmath42 250 @xmath3 kpc sample , but is not transmitted into a higher sfr until galaxies are still closer .",
    "our simulations suggest this physical picture holds for about 50% of the close pairs ( d @xmath42 250 @xmath3 kpc ) in the v box with m@xmath55/m@xmath35 @xmath53 0.2 .",
    "in higher density environments , observed galaxies tend to be more massive , redder ( lower ssfr ) , and have less h@xmath6 gas ( hubble & humason 1931 ; oemler 1974 ; dressler 1980 ; balogh 2001 ; blanton et al .",
    "2003 ; solanes et al . 2001 ; haynes , giovanelli , & chincarini 1984 ) . by simply comparing the total galaxy population in the c box to that in the v box ,",
    "it is clear that our simulated galaxies follow these relationships well ( e.g. figures [ fig - ssfr ] and [ fig - smhi ] ) .        therefore , we must determine if the differences between pairs ( as defined in section [ sec : bounddef ] , a pair galaxy is gravitationally bound to at least one other galaxy that is not the cd of the largest cluster ) and the total galaxy population may be attributed to an environmental difference between bound and unbound galaxies .",
    "we show in figure [ fig - pairfrac ] that there are fewer pairs in regions close to the cd ( @xmath42 3 @xmath3 mpc ) than in regions more distant from the cluster",
    ". this may be part of the reason that the bound galaxies in this large scale environment have fewer galaxies with low ssfrs than the general galaxy population in the c box : simply because pairs are more remote from the cluster ( see figure [ fig - ssfr ] ) .",
    "similarly , we find that bound galaxies in the v box tend to be farther from the void centre than the general population .",
    "this could explain why bound galaxies in this low - density large - scale environment tend to have lower ssfrs than the general v galaxy population ",
    "although very close bound galaxies in the v box do not conform to this trend ( figure [ fig - ssfr ] ) . even though pairs avoid",
    "the centre of the cluster and void , figure [ fig - pairfracld ] shows that in both the c and v boxes the local galaxy density of bound galaxies spans a large range .    to look more closely at the local environment of bound galaxies versus",
    "the total population , figure [ fig - localdens ] shows the cdfs of our galaxy pair and total populations .",
    "we see that v box pairs tend to reside in regions of higher density ( a factor of @xmath72 ) than the total v population , whereas in the c box the environments are nearly identical , bearing mind that bound pairs with the cd galaxy of the cluster are intentionally removed from the bound pair populations in the c box in our analysis .. the closest pairs ( d @xmath42 250 kpc @xmath3 ) in both the c and v boxes reside in a higher range of local galaxy density than the total samples .",
    "this is also true if we compare the bound galaxies to the total sample that is matched in mass .",
    "the only ks test with a p value larger than 0.1 compares the total c population matched in mass to all the pairs in the c box .",
    "clearly , bound galaxies tend to reside in higher local density environments than unbound galaxies .",
    "the fact that there is a higher fraction of close pairs than pairs with larger separations in high - density environments suggests either that dense environments are more conducive to the formation of close pairs , or that in general pairs have a lifetime on order of the hubble time and move closer together as they migrate to denser environments , or a combination of these two factors .",
    "in the c box , bound galaxies have a strong tendency to have higher ssfrs and be more h@xmath6-rich , which is opposite to what one would predict from the fact that bound galaxies reside in higher density environments .",
    "it is less clear whether the v box bound galaxies are influenced by the fact that they tend to reside in higher density environments than the total population .",
    "first , there is an excess of galaxies with low ssfrs in all v bound galaxy populations except the hop multi - peak sample .",
    "this trend could be explained by the environment .",

    "the v bound population tends to have more h@xmath6-rich galaxies , which would not be caused by a dense environment . combining these facts",

    "focusing on the c and v box galaxies separately leads us to our second question : how does the large - scale structure affect the star - forming fraction ?",
    "in the bottom panel , the trend with local density is much stronger for the c box galaxies , which drops by about 55% compared to the @xmath720% drop in the v box over the same local density range ( the first three bins ) .",
    "this drop remains nearly identical ( 30% difference versus 35% difference ) when we match the local density distributions ( p value of 0.93 ) and the mass distributions ( p value of 0.78 ) of the c and v galaxies within the third density bin ( the bin with the largest difference between the c and v box total galaxy populations ) . in the two lower density bins ,",
    "the v box and c box galaxies have similar star - forming fractions , and the v box galaxies are less affected by local density than the c box galaxies only in the third density bin , where the error bars on the v box galaxies are quite large .",
    "the lower star - forming fraction at similar @xmath5 ( 1 @xmath42 @xmath5 @xmath42 83 ) may indicate that c box galaxies are more likely to be in larger groups than v box galaxies .",
    "although to first order @xmath5 is a measure of halo mass , in large halos there can be a large range of @xmath5 .",
    "for example , even within one abell radius of the cluster centre ( 1.5 @xmath3 mpc ) , @xmath5 can be as low as 1.5 @xmath44 mpc@xmath45 .",
    "we find that in general the local density has a stronger affect on the star - forming fraction than whether a galaxy is in the c box ( large - scale overdensity ) or v box ( large - scale underdensity ) .",
    "however , at higher local densities , there is a significant difference between c and v box galaxies , which may be indication of some effects on intermediate scales (  1 mpc ) , such as whether or not a galaxy is close to the cluster ( or a group ) .",
    "finally , we consider whether being a member of a pair affects the star - forming fraction . in the top panel",
    "we compare the total population ( black ) to the close pairs ( d @xmath42 250 kpc @xmath3 including hop multi - peak galaxies in green ) in the c plus v boxes . in the two lowest density bins ,",
    "the populations have the same star - forming fraction within the error bars . in the two highest local density bins , the star - forming fractions of the pairs are higher than the star - forming fraction of the total population ( although the error bars in the highest bin are large ) .",
    "we checked these results using only the hop multi - peak sample , and while the error bars are much larger , we find the same trends .",
    "we also considered whether simply being near another galaxy could cause this increase in the star - forming fraction by comparing the close bound galaxies to the close unbound galaxies ( see appendix [ sec : unbound ] ) .",
    "although with four close unbound galaxies in the v box our results are dominated by the c box galaxies , we still find the same trends  the star - forming fraction decreases with local density and in the two lower - density bins the bound galaxy star - forming fraction agrees within the errors with that of the close unbound galaxies . in the highest local density bin the bound galaxy star - forming fraction is significantly higher than that of unbound close galaxies .",
    "we have also examined the median ssfr of star - forming galaxies in appendix [ sec : medianssfr ] .",
    "we find that the star - forming fraction does not strongly depend on galaxy mass and the local density distribution of pairs versus the total sample in appendices [ sec : ssfrmass ] & [ sec : ssfrlocald ] .    to summarize all of the information in figure [ fig - bluefrac ] , we find two main effects on the star - forming fraction .",
    "first , the fraction of star - forming galaxies is most strongly dependent on local density ( @xmath5 ) , dropping by about 80% ( from nearly 100% to about 20% ) from our lowest to highest density bin ( i.e. from voids to clusters ) .",
    "second , being a member of a bound pair affects the star - forming fraction of the galaxy population only at the highest local densities , with a boost in the star - forming fraction of more than 10% .",
    "we believe the first conclusion to be very robust and it is indeed a fundamental environmental effect .",
    "the second effect is more difficult to decipher physically for the following reason .",
    "it could be that the local environment indeed plays the primary role to produce the seen effect .",
    "alternatively , one might envision the following picture .",
    "galaxies tend to move to higher local density environments with time , whether they are isolated , in pairs , or in groups .",
    "pairs may form at some intermediate local density . with time",
    "these pairs move to higher density regions and at the same time become more closely separated . if a portion of these close pairs results in more enhanced star formation , it could explain , at least in part , the seen trend . such a picture is also consistent with the higher fraction of close pairs in higher density environments ( figure [ fig - localdens ] ) .",
    "however , we would expect the hop multi - peak sample to have a higher fraction of star - forming galaxies at any local density , and we only find a difference of that sort in the highest local density bin . we defer a more careful examination of this issue to a future study .",
    "in figure [ fig - verybluefrac ] we plot the fraction of galaxies with ssfr @xmath36 10@xmath51 yr@xmath25 in four bins of local density , which as before are chosen so that the second lowest density bin contained a large number of galaxies from both the c and v boxes , and the second highest density bin reached the maximum local density of v box galaxies .",
    "this ssfr is the limit used by heinis et al .",

    "if we compare close pairs ( d @xmath42 250 @xmath3 kpc bound including hop multi - peak galaxies ) to the mass - matched total galaxy sample , we can clearly see that the values are the same to well within the errors .",
    "in fact , these errors are large enough that we can only say that the fraction of starburst galaxies decreases with increasing local density ( by about 10% ) . the fraction of starburst galaxies is affected less than the fraction of star - forming galaxies by both local density and whether a galaxy is a member of a close pair .",
    "-rich galaxies in close pairs ( d @xmath42 250 kpc @xmath3 galaxies plus hop multi - peak galaxies ) compared to a sample of the total population matched to the mass and local density distribution of the pairs .",

    "see section [ sec : env ] for discussion . ]      in figure [ fig - mhifrac ] we plot the fraction of galaxies with m@xmath55/m@xmath35 @xmath56 0.1 , which we will call the h@xmath6-rich fraction , with the comparison sample matched for both mass and local density to the pair sample . as with the star - forming fraction ,",

    "this indicates that galaxies in the v box have easier access to cold gas , which , by comparison to the star - forming fraction , does not necessarily result in high star - formation rates .",
    "we will now briefly compare our results to the observations of ellison et al .",
    "ellison et al . ( 2010 ) consider whether environment changes the effect of being in a close pair . in direct opposition to our results",
    ", they find that star formation is more enhanced for close pairs at low projected local density , with no increase in the median ssfr for projected pairs in their highest local density bin .",
    "using projected local density , we still find results opposite to theirs . a number of factors may have contributed to this difference .",
    "the main physical difference between our simulation and their observation is that pairs in our simulation are physically bound , while observed projected pairs may contain interlopers . in particular , the paired galaxies in the higher density bins in ellison et al .",
    "( 2010 ) may contain a high fraction of unpaired interlopers ( as we have shown earlier ) , which may lower the ssfr of their pair population in high density regions . to illustrate how this affects our results , we find that the fraction of star - forming projected pairs in our third local density bin ( 1 @xmath42 @xmath5 @xmath42 83 ) is 49% , which is below the 60% star - forming fraction of close pairs ( d @xmath42 250 kpc @xmath3 galaxies plus hop multi - peak galaxies ) , and within the error bar of the total galaxy population shown in the top panel of figure [ fig - bluefrac ] .",

    "( 2010 ) is much larger than our sample , so the close pairs at which they see this increase in ssfr are within 30 kpc @xmath57 .",
    "this corresponds roughly to our hop multi - peak sample , which is too small to make any robust conclusions .",
    "in the two lowest density bins , we have 16 and 26 hop multi - peak galaxies , respectively .",
    "therefore , we may not have a large enough sample to identify the specific signal observed by ellison et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "there are also differences related to the method used to calculate local density .",
    "we use all of the galaxies in each box to determine the projected local density for this rough comparison , but ellison et al .",

    "another possible explanation for the differences in the bound pair ( as defined in section [ sec : bounddef ] , a pair galaxy is gravitationally bound to at least one other galaxy that is not the cd of the largest cluster ) and total populations is that bound galaxies are interacting .",

    "+    +    we can perform a quantitative check by noting that galaxies may be gravitationally strongly interacting if they are closer than the tidal distance , which we estimate as the roche radius : @xmath58 in figure [ fig - interacting ] , we plot the number density of pairs in the ( distance / roche radius ) - ssfr two - dimensional plane .",
    "note that the roche radius is recalculated for every pair or group using the above equation .",
    "the top left panel is the major member of the pair in the c box , the bottom left panel is the minor member of the pair in the c box , the top right panel is the major member of the pair in the v box , and the bottom right panel is the minor member of the pair in the v box . the ( distance / roche radius ) bins are evenly spaced in log .",
    "the ssfr bins are evenly spaced in log above 10@xmath59 yr@xmath25 , and the two bins below 10@xmath59 yr@xmath25 contain all of the galaxies with ssfr lower than 10@xmath59 yr@xmath25 .",
    "we also split the x - axis into three separate groups : non - star forming , star - forming , and starburst galaxies , and split the y - axis into two regions : inside or outside the roche radius . each of these six bins is labeled with the number of galaxies it contains .",
    "examining the orbits of all of these bound galaxies is beyond the scope of this paper , but we do note that it is possible that galaxies that are currently outside of the roche radius may have been closer at some point in the past .    from these histograms , we see that there is no strong trend of ssfr with galaxy distance .",
    "if we focus only on the larger bins , there is some indication that the major galaxy in a pair may be more likely to be a starburst galaxy if the minor bound galaxy is within the roche radius , although the numbers of galaxies in the ssfr @xmath36 10@xmath51 yr@xmath25 bins are small .",
    "the major bound galaxies are slightly less likely to have low ssfr ( ssfr @xmath42 10@xmath49 yr@xmath25 ) if the minor galaxy is within its roche radius .",
    "these points could indicate that a major galaxy with the minor member of the pair within its roche radius is able to accrete cold gas either from the minor member of the pair , or from gas in the nearby environment .",
    "the minor bound galaxy is more likely to have a ssfr @xmath42 10@xmath49 yr@xmath25 if it is within the roche radius of the major galaxy , and slightly less likely to have a ssfr @xmath36 10@xmath51 yr@xmath25 .",
    "thus , we do not see evidence of tidal triggering of star - formation in the smaller galaxy in a pair .",
    "instead , it seems that being bound to a larger galaxy decreases the ssfr .",
    "we can not say whether this is due to a gravitational interaction with the major member of the pair or if these galaxies are simply entering higher density environments , where any of a number of other mechanisms could redden the galaxy ( e.g. harassment or ram pressure stripping , as discussed in the introduction ) .",
    "finally , if we consider all galaxies ( major and minor ) that are in pairs , we find that galaxies with the minor member inside the roche radius are about 10% less likely to be star - forming ( ssfr @xmath36 10@xmath49 yr@xmath25 ) than galaxies with the minor pair outside the roche radius .",
    "therefore , although close pairs may be gravitationally interacting , we conclude that to first order these interactions are not resulting in the different ssfrs of close bound galaxies ( d @xmath42 250 @xmath3 kpc plus hop multi - peak galaxies ) relative to the global galaxy population that we see in figure [ fig - bluefrac ] .",
    "on large scales , global structures , such as around a rich cluster of galaxies or a void region , are expected to evolve differently , with the large - scale overdensity playing the role of a dynamic  clock \" . in this sense ,",
    "a large - scale overdense region is dynamically more advanced than a large - scale underdense region .",
    "this is in accord with one s intuitive expectation , for example , that a cluster is dynamically more developed than a field region that is yet to collapse , which in turn is more advanced than a void region that may still be experiencing expansion .",
    "this macroscopic view is in line with the differences we see when comparing the c and v box total galaxy populations .",
    "c box galaxies are more massive and have lower ssfrs and less cold gas than the v box population .",
    "it seems that local overdensity , as parameterized by @xmath5 , plays a more important role with respect to star formation , galaxy colour , gas cooling , etc , at least at @xmath60 - @xmath61 range examined here .",
    "we suggest that the local overdensity effectively determines the thermodynamic properties of the gas , primarily dictated by the strength of the converging shocks due to the collapse of embedding large - scale structures .",
    "for example , in cluster environments the gas is heated to a high temperature commensurate with the depth of the potential well of the cluster , whereas in large - scale filaments and sheets the temperature is determined by the 2-d or 1-d zeldovich pancake collapse of the corresponding large - scale density fluctuations . to zero - th order , a local density measure , such as @xmath5 , is a measure of the local gas temperature or perhaps more importantly the amount of cold gas ( cen 2011 ) ; at a fixed galaxy halo mass , a higher @xmath5 corresponds to a lower amount of cold gas than a lower @xmath5 .",
    "if we place this in the nomenclature of cold and hot mode accretion , @xmath5 effectively measures the  halo \" mass of the embedding structure of the galaxy in question ( although this is not necessarily limited to virialized systems ) .",
    "there are also a number of interactions that can occur in large halos that may remove a galaxy s gas , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "once a galaxy s gas has been exhausted or removed in these massive , hot halos , there is no simple mode for replenishing the reservoir ( but see kauffmann et al .",
    "2010 ) .    within this context we can understand the trend of galaxies having more cold gas , and higher ssfrs in low density regions than in high density regions for the general galaxy population .",
    "we see the trend of increasing star - forming fraction with decreasing @xmath5 in figure [ fig - bluefrac ] .",
    "as we have shown , bound galaxy pairs tend to avoid cluster environments as well as void regions ( figures [ fig - pairfrac ] and [ fig - pairfracld ] ) . as a result of this ",
    "selection \" effect , bound galaxy pairs tend to be redder than void galaxies but bluer than cluster galaxies .",
    "however , this effect alone does not explain all the trends we have found for galaxy pairs .",
    "gravitational interactions between bound galaxies cause an additional , subtle physical effect that is dependent on local overdensity . at a relatively high @xmath5 ,",
    "hot gas is more dominant in or surrounding a galaxy halo . in this case , in our simulation close galaxy - galaxy interactions induce shocks , gas compression and cooling of hot gas that causes a noticeable increase in the amount of cold gas , which in turn causes the interacting galaxies to have a higher star formation rate .",
    "thus , galaxy pairs in relatively high density regions tend to be bluer and more h@xmath6-gas rich than the general galaxy population at the same density . on the other hand , at a relatively low @xmath5",
    "the amount of hot gas is negligible compared to the much larger amount of cold gas available .",
    "thus , any cooling of the hot halo caused by close galaxy - galaxy interactions does not substantially increase the amount of cold gas .",
    "indeed , some of the initially cold gas could be shock - heated to hot gas or disrupted during the interactions . consequently",
    ", galaxy pairs in relatively low density regions tend to have colours and h@xmath6-fractions similar to the total population in those regions .    whether the cooling of hot halo gas influences the ssfr of galaxies depends on whether the galaxies at that local density are rich or poor in h@xmath6 . in our pair galaxies ,",
    "the replacement of direct cold gas accretion with cooling gas from the hot halo can be most directly seen by examining figure [ fig - mhifrac ] .",
    "the h@xmath6 fraction decreases as the local density increases , and only at the highest local densities do bound galaxies have higher h@xmath6 fractions than the comparison population .",
    "this cooling from the hot halo is a smaller effect than the strong dependence of h@xmath6 gas content on local density , as evidenced by the smaller difference between the fraction of h@xmath6-rich bound and matched samples in the highest density bin compared to the difference between the  total \" populations in the middle and highest density bins .",
    "the properties of close unbound galaxies support this scenario .",
    "they have redder colours and lower h@xmath6 fractions than the bound galaxies , which are undergoing a more extended interaction . also , unbound close galaxies are in higher density environments , and because of the strong correlation we find between local density and galaxy colour we would expect them to be redder .",
    "we have examined the galaxies formed in a large , 120 @xmath3 mpc cosmological simulation in detail in two zoomed - in boxes : one centred on a void of size 31 @xmath16 31 @xmath16 35 @xmath17 mpc@xmath18 and the other on a cluster of size 21 @xmath16 24 @xmath16 20 @xmath17 mpc@xmath18 .",
    "the two refined regions have an overlapping range of local densities , which allows us to separate local and large - scale environmental effects .",
    "we have utilized the high resolution ( 0.46 @xmath3 kpc ) in these regions to examine galaxies in detail to determine how being a member of a pair ( as defined in section [ sec : bounddef ] , a pair galaxy is gravitationally bound to at least one other galaxy that is not the cd of the largest cluster ) affects galaxy properties and whether these effects depend on environment .",
    "we now summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "\\1 ) we use the three - dimensional information provided by our simulation to determine whether the observational criteria used to choose projected pairs identify physically bound pairs .",
    "we find that these criteria yield pair samples that include a larger fraction of spurious pairs than in previous work ( perez et al .",
    "2006a found 27% spurious fraction to our 48% ) .",
    "if we only consider projected pairs in the lower - density v box , we find a much lower spurious pair fraction of 12% . in qualitative agreement with previous work ,",
    "we find that the fraction of spurious pairs increases in dense regions . in order to agree with perez et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , we must only consider regions with @xmath5 @xmath43 1 @xmath44 mpc@xmath45 , which is less dense than group environments . in order to understand if pair interactions may redden galaxies , it is important to consider higher local densities where a larger fraction of the galaxy population is red .",
    "the high fraction of spurious pairs at high densities ( 58% at @xmath5 @xmath36 1 @xmath44 mpc@xmath45 ) may have masked the trends we find for pair galaxies as a function of local density in some observed samples .",
    "\\2 ) we find that , of all pairs , ( 59%,13% , 28% ) are wet , dry and mixed pairs , respectively , which are in excellent agreement with the corresponding fractions of ( 56% , 15% , 29% ) found in observed galaxy pairs by lin et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . in figure [ fig - wdmhists ]",
    "we show that the environments of these pairs are consistent with the colour - density relation .",
    "\\3 ) we see no evidence that , considering the bound population as a whole , being closer than the roche radius enhances the ssfr of gravitationally bound pair galaxies ( section [ sec : interacting ] ) .",
    "\\4 ) largely independent of being in a galaxy pair or not , the strongest trend we find is environmental , where the average ssfr is a monotonic increasing function of local environmental density , defined by @xmath5 .",
    "this trend is in broad agreement with observations from sdss .",
    "the likely physical cause for this trend is the underlying trend of higher gas temperature in higher density regions due to formation of massive halos or large scales structures such as pancakes and filaments ( kere et al .",
    "2005 , dekel & birnboim 2006 ; cen 2011 ) , which dictates the cold gas supply . this may also have to do with the many interactions that can occur in high density regions : galaxy - cluster , galaxy - galaxy , and galaxy - intracluster medium interactions can all remove galaxy s cold gas ( e.g. merritt 1984 ; moore et al .",
    "1996 ; gunn & gott 1972 ; larson et al . 1980 ) .",
    "\\5 ) being a pair galaxy has a secondary but significant effect on star formation rate and cold gas on pair galaxies .",
    "we find that galaxies in close pairs tend to have higher ssfr in high density environment than the non - paired galaxies at the same environment density ( e.g. , in and near galaxy clusters ) .",
    "such an enhancement for pairs is not seen in low density environments ( e.g. , in the centre of a void ) ; in fact , the opposite is seen there . as a result , we find that pairs in high density environments tend to have fewer low ssfr galaxies than non - pairs , where pairs in low density environments have the opposite trend . however , very close pairs ( r@xmath40 @xmath42 50 kpc , the hop multi - peak sample ) always have an elevated fraction of high ssfr galaxies , regardless of their environment .",
    "analogous statements apply to h@xmath6 gas in galaxies .",
    "6 ) interactions between close pairs affects galaxies at high local densities by cooling gas out of the hot halo , as evidenced by the higher m@xmath55/m@xmath35 of close pairs in higher local density bins rather than in lower local density bins where cold flow accretion is more common and hot gas is largely absent ( figure [ fig - mhifrac ] and section [ sec : story ] ) .",
    "our results indicate that observationally finding galaxy pairs without resorting to searches for tidally - disturbed galaxies can be difficult .",
    "that said , we do find similar results ",
    "a general increase in ssfr as galaxy pairs move closer together .",
    "we predict that if observers look for pairs specifically in and near voids , they will find that in these large - scale underdensities , the pair population will not have a larger fraction of star - forming galaxies than the total void population ( although we do see hints that the strongly star - forming fraction may be increased in pairs in voids in figure [ fig - verybluefrac ] ) .",
    "finally , we introduced this paper by claiming that mergers may increase the mass of star - forming galaxies , drive the evolution of star - forming galaxies into red and dead galaxies , and hierarchically build massive red galaxies through dry mergers .",
    "do our results and the physical explanation we put forth in section [ sec : story ] support that claim ?",
    "the answer appears to be no , as we will now discuss .",
    "first , we find that the majority of our close pairs ( d @xmath42 250 @xmath3 kpc galaxies plus d @xmath42 50 @xmath3 kpc galaxies  the hop multi - peak galaxies ) are star - forming .",
    "if we assume that these close pairs will merge , this indicates that close pair interaction of galaxies do not quench star formation prior to the merger .",
    "the fraction of strongly star - forming galaxies is very similar between the close bound pairs and total galaxy populations , indicating no significantly strong bursts of star - formation prior to merging .",
    "second , the fuel for star formation ( m@xmath55/m@xmath62 ) increases as the separation of the galaxy pair decreases .",
    "this suggests that at least during the pair interaction period prior to the final merger the gas reservoir is increased rather than decreased , even though star formation rate is higher for closer pairs . in other words",
    ", there is no sign of pair interactions causing cold gas exhaustion .",
    "third , although the close pairs ( d @xmath42 250 kpc @xmath3 plus galaxies with separations of 30 - 50 kpc @xmath3the hop multi - peak sample ) have some of the highest ssfrs of the entire galaxy population , they only account for 15 of the 39 highest ssfrs .",
    "this shows that pairs ( including very close pairs ) do not monopolize starbursts .",
    "could the remaining ( 24 out of 39 ) highest ssfr non - pair galaxies be post - merger galaxies ?",
    "we find that of the 17 galaxies with ssfr @xmath53 3 @xmath16 10@xmath51 yr@xmath25 that we can track back at least one output ( galaxies at z @xmath43 0.15 and that had m@xmath35 @xmath36 10@xmath34 m@xmath9 in the previous output ) , only one galaxy is post - merger ( had been a member of a close pair the output before , but is no longer a member of a pair ) .",
    "altogether , this evidence suggests that in general neither mergers nor pre - merger interactions quench star formation either through heating cold gas or a burst of star formation .",
    "the @xmath740% ( 15/39 ) of starbursting galaxies that are in pairs falls in the range of poststarburst galaxies observed to be merging or tidally - interacting : about 50% in poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and 25% in zabludoff et al .",
    "in fact , rather than pair interactions driving a starburst that exhausts a galaxy s reservoir of cold gas , we find that close pairs ( d @xmath42 250 @xmath3 kpc galaxies plus galaxies with separations of 30 - 50 kpc @xmath3the hop multi - peak sample ) have a higher ( m@xmath55/m@xmath62 ) .",
    "the higher star - forming fraction of close pairs , particularly at higher local densities ( and therefore in more massive halos ) may suggest that the small amount of star formation and h@xmath6 observed in otherwise red and dead disturbed galaxies is created from cooling of hot halo gas in interacting elliptical galaxies ( donovan et al .",
    "2007 ) , and therefore  dry \" mergers may hierarchically grow larger red galaxies as well as induce small amounts of star formation .",
    "donovan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) frequently find a peculiar morphology in the h@xmath6 associated with their observed red elliptical galaxies , possibly indicating a recent tidal disturbance .",
    "are mergers responsible for the colour - density relation ?",
    "available evidence suggest the answer is no .",
    "we see no evidence of close pair interactions causing accelerated removal of cold gas reservoir . nor do we see evidence of pair interactions causing star formation to cease in the outskirts of clusters of galaxies , before their entry into clusters .",
    "all evidence points to the opposite of what the colour - density relation suggests .",
    "nevertheless , our galaxies are in broad agreement with the observed colour - density relation , which strongly suggests that it is the environment , rather than pair - interactions / mergers , that is responsible for the colour - density relation",
    ". this could be due to any of several interactions that can occur in high - density environments : galaxy - cluster , galaxy - galaxy , and galaxy - intracluster medium interactions can all remove galaxy s cold gas ( e.g. merritt 1984 ; moore et al .",
    "1996 ; gunn & gott 1972 ) . also , residing in a massive halo means that galaxies do not have access to cold flows that can replenish their gas reservoir , so they will eventually be unable to form stars ( larson et al . 1980 ; kere et al .",

    "we have shown that there is a higher fraction of bound pair galaxies at higher redshifts ( section [ sec : redshift ] and table [ tbl - pairs ] ) .",
    "because at higher redshifts our galaxy population tends to be bluer and more h@xmath6-rich , our results could partially reflect this difference in the populations .    in order to determine",
    "if this is the case , we plot each set of cdfs for each individual redshift output .",
    "we find that the results at any single redshift are consistent with the results combining all the redshifts , so the differences in the redshift distributions of the total galaxy sample and the bound galaxy samples should not be the main cause of these interesting trends .",
    "we can go through each cdf in a bit more detail .",
    "first , when we examine the ssfr we find that at all redshifts , the c box bound galaxies have a smaller fraction of low ssfr galaxies than the corresponding total c population ( as in the combined redshifts shown in figure [ fig - ssfr ] ) . in the v box , at all redshifts the total pair and close pair ( d @xmath42 250 @xmath3 kpc ) populations have a slightly higher fraction of low ssfr galaxies .",
    "these separated redshift results agree with the combined redshift results shown in figure [ fig - ssfr ] .",
    "there is a higher fraction of pair galaxies with high ssfrs at z=0.15 and z=0.2 , while the fraction of high ssfr galaxies is very similar in the pair and total v populations at z = 0 and z = 0.05 .",
    "however , z=0.05 has an excess in the blue population of hop multi - peak galaxies in both the c and v boxes . at any redshift pairs either have a higher fraction of high ssfr galaxies ( z = 0.05 , 0.15 , 0.2 ) or have the same fraction of high ssfr galaxies compared to the total population ( z = 0 ) .",
    "comparing to figure [ fig - smhi ] , in the h@xmath6-fraction cdfs we find that at all redshifts , the c box bound galaxies have a smaller fraction of h@xmath6-poor galaxies than the total c population , and the fraction decreases when we consider only close bound pairs ( d @xmath42 250 @xmath3 kpc ) . in the v box , at all redshifts the fraction of h@xmath6-poor galaxies is similar between bound galaxies and the total populations .",
    "again , these trends agree with the combined redshifts shown in figure [ fig - smhi ] . at all redshifts above z=0 v pairs have a higher fraction of h@xmath6-rich galaxies than the total v population . finally , at all redshifts but z = 0",
    "the c bound galaxies are at higher local densities than the total populations . in the v box , at all redshifts pairs tend to be at higher local densities than the total v galaxy population .",
    "these trends agree with the trends in figure [ fig - localdens ] .",
    "in addition , we compare the star - forming fraction of pairs and the total population for each individual redshift output . as in the cdf comparisons , at each individual redshift the results are consistent with figure [ fig - bluefrac ] . even if we plot the star - forming fraction of close pairs ( d @xmath42 250 kpc @xmath3 plus hop multi - peak ) from all redshift outputs against the star - forming fraction of only the z = 0.2 total population we find nearly identical results . when comparing close bound pairs to the total galaxy population at z = 0.2 only , in the two lower density bins the total population has a slightly higher star - forming fraction than the bound population , in the third local density bin the star - forming fraction of close pairs is higher than that of the total population , and in the fourth local density bin the star - forming fraction of close pairs is higher than that of the total population with large , overlapping error bars .",
    "it is possible that because we observe many of our galaxies multiple times , the pair population happens to be bluer and more h@xmath6-rich than the total population throughout the simulation for reasons other than being a member of a bound pair .",
    "although we must admit this is a possibility , we do not consider it very likely .",
    "indeed , we can think of no other commonality that may be responsible for these galaxy properties .",
    "we conclude that the redshift distribution of the galaxies is not the main driver of our results .",
    "one advantage of using a simulation is that we can determine whether close galaxies are in fact gravitationally bound .",
    "we can determine whether being in a bound pair ( as defined in section [ sec : bounddef ] , a pair galaxy is gravitationally bound to at least one other galaxy that is not the cd of the largest cluster ) affects a galaxy differently than simply being in the midst of a close fly - by . in order to do this , we compare close bound galaxies ( d @xmath42 250 @xmath3 kpc ) to galaxies that are not bound to any other galaxy but are within 250 @xmath3 kpc of another galaxy , shown in figure [ fig - pairnopair ] . because the samples are small , we do not attempt to match the mass distribution of the bound galaxies with d @xmath42 250 kpc @xmath3 and include a cdf of m@xmath35 .",
    "we also include cdfs of @xmath5 in this figure for uniformity , but we will discuss this panel in later sections . in figure [ fig - pairnopair ] , the dashed lines are the pairs within d @xmath42 250 kpc @xmath3 , and the solid lines are close unbound galaxies .",
    "although we will discuss the c box ( red lines ) and v box ( blue lines ) galaxies separately , we also include the c plus v box samples in the figure as the black lines . as usual , there are more c box galaxies , and they dominate the c plus v box samples to the point that the black lines can barely be seen for the unbound close galaxies .     250 kpc @xmath3 ) as dash - dotted lines . see section [ sec : unbound ] for discussion . ]",
    "we first consider the c box ( red lines ) . even though we choose not to include any close unbound galaxies within 1.4 @xmath3 mpc of the cluster centre so as not to skew the results with red cluster galaxies , being in a bound pair results in different galaxy properties than simply having a close fly - by .",
    "bound galaxies have a higher fraction of galaxies with ssfr @xmath36 10@xmath49 yr@xmath25 than the close but unbound galaxies .",
    "similarly , close unbound galaxies tend to have lower h@xmath6 gas fractions than close bound galaxies , although the overall ranges of m@xmath55/m@xmath35 are similar .",
    "the lower ssfrs and h@xmath6 fractions of the unbound galaxies can not be attributed to the difference in the underlying stellar mass distributions , because the unbound galaxies tend to be less massive than close bound pairs .",
    "now , we turn to v box galaxies .",
    "we see that the ssfr distribution of unbound galaxies spans a smaller range in ssfr than that of the bound galaxies .",
    "considering that there are only 4 galaxies in the unbound sample , we can not conclude that this is or is not a close match to the bound sample .",
    "the h@xmath6 mass - fraction cdfs compare similarly to the ssfr cdfs .",
    "in contrast to the c box , the unbound galaxies in the v box are on the most massive end of the v bound galaxy distribution , although the small number of unbound galaxies makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions .",
    "it is likely that the m@xmath35 ( upper right panel ) and @xmath5 ( lower right panel ) cdfs for the c box close unbound galaxies are affected by the exclusion of galaxies within 1.4 @xmath3 mpc of the cluster centre . despite that , the common trends for both v and c boxes are that close unbound galaxies tend to be redder and less h@xmath6 rich than bound pairs . including",
    "cluster galaxies would likely strengthen these trends .",
    "we also examine whether the environment or pair membership affects the ssfr of star - forming galaxies ( ssfr @xmath36 10@xmath49 yr@xmath25 ) .",
    "we find that the median ssfr of star - forming galaxies increases by a factor of two from our highest to our lowest local density , but with very large error bars .",
    "there is no discernible difference between the v box and c box galaxies , except perhaps in the highest density bin , where the star - forming v box galaxies have a marginally higher median ssfr .",
    "being a member of a pair has a negligible affect on the median ssfr of star - forming galaxies .",
    "as with all of our results , we have to consider whether the decrease in star - forming fraction is due to local density or to the fact that the mass of galaxies increases with local density .",
    "we have tested this in a few ways .",
    "first , we split our data set into bins of stellar mass instead of local density .",
    "we find that the star - forming fraction is larger by more than 15% in galaxies with masses below 3 @xmath16 10@xmath54 m@xmath9 than in galaxies with stellar masses above 3 @xmath16 10@xmath54 m@xmath9 .",
    "this variation with mass is much smaller than the variation we find with local density .",
    "second , we considered galaxies only within a certain stellar mass range : below 3 @xmath16 10@xmath54 m@xmath9 , above 3 @xmath16 10@xmath54 m@xmath9 , and above 10@xmath63 m@xmath9 . using the same local density bins , the galaxies above and below 3 @xmath16 10@xmath54 m@xmath9 have very similar star - forming fractions , with the lower mass galaxies having slightly higher star - forming fraction at the lower densities ( @xmath43 7% higher fraction ) , and a slightly lower star - forming fraction in the highest density bin ( a 3% smaller star - forming fraction ) .",
    "if we only consider our extremely high mass galaxies , with stellar masses above 10@xmath63 m@xmath9 , we can only look at the two higher local density bins , and the fractions are the same to well within the error bars ( and with a star - forming fraction that is nearly 25% above the star - forming fraction of the lower mass galaxies in the highest local density bin ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this trend of star formation with local density is mostly due to local density , not to galaxy mass",
    ".    as we have discussed ( for example , in section [ sec : galaxyselection ] ) , although our high - mass galaxies are redder than our low - mass galaxies , they have more star formation than observed galaxies , and some continue to grow to high stellar masses .",
    "this is likely part of the reason that we see little difference in the star - forming fraction of galaxies at different masses .",
    "this problem does not affect our results because they are based on comparisons within our simulation .",
    "if our star - forming fraction is high , it will be high in both bound and unbound galaxies .",
    "if anything , the higher sfr for some large galaxies ( cd , etc ) will weaken the environmental trends .",
    "because our result that being a member of a bound pair boosts ( by more than 10% ) the star - forming fraction of the galaxy population only at the highest local densities is an important result , we consider the fact that even in each of our four local density bins close bound pair galaxies may have a different @xmath5 distribution than the total population . therefore , in addition to mass - matching , we also match the cdfs of @xmath5 . similar to before",
    ", we find that in the two lower local density bins the bound and matched samples star - forming fractions are the same within the error bars , and in the two highest local density bins the bound galaxies have a significantly higher star - forming fraction than the matched ( in both mass and local density ) population , the same trend as without @xmath5 and mass matching ."
