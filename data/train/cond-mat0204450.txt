    "landauer s formulation of quantum transport showed that when elastic scattering dominates , the electrical conductance can be related to the transmission coefficient of the electron waves@xcite . in the ideal case of no scattering , this leads to a universal conductance that is quantized in units of @xmath1 at low temperatures , with an additional quantum of conductance added as each channel or mode of the conductance pathway opens up .",
    "the application of similar ideas to the phonon counterpart , namely thermal conductance , was recently derived by a number of authors@xcite , and is now recognized@xcite to be related to earlier work on the entropy transport at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "rego and kirczenow have extended the concept of the universality of the thermal conductance to particles of arbitrary statistics ( anyons)@xcite .    in the case of electrical resistance ,",
    "the chemical potential or the number of conducting modes can be varied at very low temperatures , giving sharp jumps between various quantized values of the resistance . on the other hand , thermal transport by phonons",
    "necessarily requires nonzero temperatures to populate the modes of the conducting pathway , and the width of the bose distribution function smears out the quantization of the conductance . only at very low temperatures , where just the modes of the conducting pathway with zero frequency at long wavelengths contribute to the thermal conductance , the quantization of the ideal conductance becomes apparent in a universal thermal conductance @xmath2 with @xmath3 the universal conductance per mode , with @xmath4 boltzmann s constant and @xmath5 planck s constant , and @xmath6 is the number of modes with zero frequency at long wavelengths , which is four for a freely suspended elastic beam connecting the two thermal reservoirs .",
    "note that this value of the low temperature conductance in the absence of scattering is independent of the dimensions and elastic properties of the thermal pathway .",
    "a low temperature thermal conductance consistent with the predicted universal value was measured by schwab et al.@xcite in experiments on a lithographically defined mesoscopic suspended beam ( of dimensions about @xmath7 ) . whilst their elegant experiment displays the universality of ballistic phonon transport ,",
    "the experiment also showed a _ decrease _ in the thermal conductance below the universal value in the temperature range of @xmath8 that can not be explained by the ballistic theory , since in this theory an increase in the thermal conductance is expected as the temperature is raised and more modes are excited .",
    "the decrease in thermal conductance is presumably associated with the scattering of the thermal phonons , and can be understood using the ideas of landauer in terms of the scattering coefficient of the vibrational waves .",
    "this is the topic of the present paper .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the effect on the low temperature thermal conductance of the scattering of the thermal phonons by surface roughness , which is likely to be the major source of scattering in mesoscopic samples .",
    "the scattering of scalar waves , described by the simple wave equation , in waveguides with rough surfaces has been investigated by many workers , including ourselves , using both numerical and analytic methods@xcite .",
    "however , for the low frequency modes of interest in the low temperature thermal conductance , the physical vibrational waves have quite different properties than the waves in the scalar model .",
    "for example the dispersion relations of the modes are different , with two of the four modes with zero long - wavelength frequency having a quadratic dispersion at small wave vectors , rather than the linear dependence given by the simple scalar theory . to understand the experimental results quantitatively , a more accurate treatment of the vibrational waves is needed . at low temperatures the wavelengths of the thermally excited modes are large compared with the atomic spacing , and so a treatment based on the equations of macroscopic elasticity theory is appropriate .",
    "blencowe@xcite has considered the scattering of elastic waves in a thin plate waveguide with rough surfaces , but prior to our work , the scattering of elastic waves confined in a beam - like wave guide with rough surfaces has not been considered .",
    "previously , we have investigated the effect of surface scattering on the low temperature thermal conductance using the scalar wave model@xcite . in that paper",
    "we noted the apparent discrepancy between the results of scalar model with a simple assumption for the nature of the surface roughness and the data by schwab et al .",
    "below a temperature of @xmath9 : the data seemed to show a delay of the onset of scattering as the temperature increased that was not predicted by the model .",
    "however , since the scalar model does not properly account for the properties of the elastic waves , it was not clear whether this discrepancy is due to an inadequate modelling of the surface roughness , or the flaw in the description of the waves themselves . to resolve this matter , and obtain a more accurate account of the scattering of the waves by rough surfaces , we develop a theory of based on the full elasticity equations , and use this to calculate the thermal conductance at low temperatures . a short version of this work has been previously published@xcite .    in section  [ sec_formalism ] ,",
    "the scattering of elastic waves confined to a beam of rectangular cross - section with rough surfaces is calculated using the full three dimensional elasticity theory .",
    "we use a green theorem approach , and calculate the scattering coefficient to quadratic order in the amplitude of the surface roughness .",
    "these results are quite general , but rather intractable for further progress , since the structure of the modes in an elastic beam can not be determined in closed form . thus in section  [ sec_plate ] we reduce the expressions to a thin plate limit to provide a closed form for the displacement fields , and to obtain analytical expressions for the scattering behavior . in section [ sec_scattering ]",
    "the general behavior of the scattering and the effect on the thermal conductance is analyzed in detail , using a simple description of the surface roughness , to investigate the physical consequences of the novel features of the elastic waves . in section [ sec_experiment ]",
    "we use our theory to attempt to fit the data of schwab et al@xcite using more realistic descriptions of the surface roughness .",
    "a number of the more difficult issues that arise in the elasticity theory are described in appendices .",
    "although our main interest is the scattering of thermally excited vibrational waves in mesoscopic systems at low temperatures , the formulation of the surface scattering is quite general , and can be applied to other situations , such as the scattering of mechanically excited modes in macroscopic samples for example .",
    "the main focus of this paper is the effect of surface roughness on the low temperature thermal conductance of mesoscopic structures .",
    "the geometry we consider is a freely suspended elastic beam , which we call the bridge , connecting two thermal reservoirs .",
    "we will consider a beam of rectangular cross - section of dimensions width @xmath10 ( in the @xmath11 direction ) and depth @xmath12 ( in the @xmath13 direction ) .",
    "mesoscopic structures are often produced lithographically from epitaxially grown material .",
    "we choose a convention that the depth is the dimension in the growth direction , and the width in the lithographically defined transverse direction .",
    "we define the length of the rectangular beam of nominally uniform cross section as @xmath14 . in practice",
    "the bridge may be joined to the reservoirs smoothly , by a portion of continuously growing width , to eliminate or reduce the scattering of the vibration modes off a sharp junction .",
    "we will suppose that the scattering by roughness is important only in some narrower portion of length @xmath14 .",
    "the thermal conductance is given by the expression@xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the cutoff frequency of the @xmath17 th mode , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the temperature .",
    "the integration is over the frequency @xmath20 of the modes @xmath17 that propagate in the structure .",
    "the transmission coefficient is unity for the ideal case .",
    "any scattering reduces the thermal conductance , and scattering of the lowest modes can reduce the conductance below the universal value at low temperatures .    to actually perform the scattering calculation we imbed the rough beam of length @xmath14 in an infinite beam of the same cross section but with smooth surfaces outside of the region of length @xmath14 , fig .",
    "[ modelstructure ] .",
    "thus the mathematical calculation is the scattering of a wave incident from @xmath21 on a rough portion of the beam with surfaces at @xmath22 and at @xmath23 , with the height functions @xmath24 , defining the roughness , nonzero only in a finite region @xmath25 .",

    "we find different power laws for the various mode scattering processes that can be understood largely from the dispersion relations at : @xmath20 for intramode scattering for the in - plane bend mode ( the flex - bend intramode scattering is anomalous because of a cancellation between leading order terms , and varies as @xmath349 ) ; @xmath294 for scattering between the bend modes and the modes with linear dispersion ( torsion and compression modes ) ; and the usual @xmath0 for the intramode scattering of the modes with linear dispersion .",

    "although the scatter in the data is considerable at these low temperatures , the observations seem to show a delay in the onset of the depression scattering as the temperature is raised , beyond what can be fitted with our predictions for unstructured surface roughness .",
    "we tentatively resolve this delay by supposing that the surface roughness has a maximum amplitude at some nonzero length scale , which we parameterize by a shifted gaussian correlation function .",

    "our results are based on second order perturbation theory , and the thermal conductance is evaluated assuming the scattering over the length of the device is small .",
    "this is a good approximation at low temperatures , but the scattering becomes strong at higher temperatures , particularly for the new modes excited as the temperature is raised , which have a diverging scattering at onset due to the flat dispersion relation here . at higher temperatures multiple scattering and perhaps phonon localization will therefore become important .",
