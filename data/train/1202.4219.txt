    "convective overshooting is an important physical process in the stellar structure and evolution .",
    "phenomenologically , the acceleration of a fluid element is zero at the convective boundary , but its speed is not zero .",
    "it is able to go across the convective boundary into the dynamically stable zone .",
    "this phenomenon is called the convective overshooting .",
    "the convective overshooting transports heat and matter , and affects the structure and evolution of stars .",
    "a phenomenological theory of the overshooting was developed by zahn(1991 ) , which predicts an adiabatic overshooting region .",
    "however , xiong & deng(2001 ) pointed out that the turbulent velocity and the temperature are strongly correlated in zahn s theory .",
    "recently , christensen - dalsgaard et al.(2011 ) found that the convective overshooting only described by the turbulent convection models could be in agreement with the helioseismic data .",
    "the turbulent convection models ( tcms ) are based on fully hydrodynamic moment equations , and applied on investigating the convective overshooting@xcite .",
    "there are two main difficulties restricting the applications of the tcms .",
    "one is to solve the equations of the tcms , which are highly non - linear and unstable in numerical calculations .",
    "the other is to incorporate the tcms into a stellar evolution code . in general , solving the tcms needs the parameters of the stellar structure(e.g .",
    "temperature @xmath7 , density @xmath8 , pressure @xmath9 , radius @xmath10 , luminosity @xmath11 , and elements abundance vector ) , and solving the equations of stellar structure requires the temperature gradient @xmath12 which is determined by the tcms .",
    "thus , in order to apply the tcms , one must solve both the tcms and the equations of stellar structure , which shows enormous difficulty .",
    "although developing numerical technique is very important , getting an approximate solution of the tcms is more interesting because an approximate solution helps to understand the physical processes and may significantly simplify the application of the tcms .",
    "xiong(1989 ) found the asymptotic solution of his tcm in the overshooting region , the turbulent correlations being exponentially decreasing in the overshooting region .",
    "however , his solution of the heat flux @xmath1 is not suitable near the convective boundary , and the initial turbulent kinetic energy @xmath13 is unknown so that the value of the turbulent correlations in the overshooting region actually can not be determined without numerical calculations .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the properties of the convective overshooting by analyzing li & yang s tcm@xcite , which was tested in the solar convection zone@xcite .",
    "we try to get a semi - analytical solution of the tcm in the overshooting region .",
    "we introduce the tcm in section 2 , investigate the properties of the overshooting in section 3 , and summarize the conclusions in section 4 .",
    "the closure assumptions of li & yang s tcm are@xcite : the three - order moment terms are modeled with a gradient - type scheme ; the dissipation rate @xmath14 of the turbulent kinetic energy @xmath0 is assumed to be local ; the dissipation rates of the turbulent heat flux @xmath1 and the turbulent fluctuation of temperature @xmath2 are assumed to be determined by both the reciprocal timescale of the turbulent dissipation @xmath15 and the thermal dissipation one @xmath16 . according to those closure assumptions , fully hydrodynamic",
    "moment equations on the quasi - steady approximation result in the complete equations of two - order moment terms@xcite : @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19@xmath20 the temperature gradient is calculated as : @xmath21 the meaning of those equations and each term in them were described in previous works@xcite in detail .",
    "we simply introduce them here :    equations ( 1 - 4 ) describe the equilibrium(time - independent ) structure of the radial kinetic energy @xmath22 , the turbulent kinetic energy @xmath0 , the turbulent heat flux @xmath1 and the turbulent fluctuation of temperature @xmath2 , respectively . on the left side of those equations , there is the non - local term(i.e .",
    "the diffusion term ) of each turbulent correlation . on the right side",
    ", there are the local terms which describe the generation and the dissipation of each turbulent correlation .    in eq.(1 ) and ( 2 ) , @xmath14 is the turbulent dissipation rate of @xmath0 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and the second term on the right side is the generation rate of the kinetic energy due to the contribution of the buoyancy .",
    "the last term in eq.(1 ) is the _ return to isotropy _ term which attempts to make the turbulent motion be isotropic . in eq.(3 ) , the first two terms on the right side is the generation rate of the turbulent heat flux @xmath1 , and the last one is the dissipation rate that comprises the turbulent dissipation and the thermal dissipation . in eq.(4 ) , the first term on the right side is the generation rate of the turbulent fluctuation of temperature @xmath2 , and the last one is the dissipation rate .",
    "meanings of other symbols are : @xmath25 is the local pressure scale height , @xmath26 the expansion coefficient , @xmath27 the radial component of gravity acceleration , @xmath28 the temperature gradient in the stellar interior , @xmath29 the adiabatic temperature gradient , @xmath30 the thermal conduction coefficient , @xmath31 the specific heat , @xmath32 the parameter of the _ return to isotropy _ term , ( @xmath33 ) the diffusion parameters and ( @xmath34 ) the dissipation parameters of turbulent variations(@xmath35 ) .    in eqs.(1 - 4 ) , overbars are only used in three turbulent correlations @xmath22 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the other variations(density @xmath8 and the temperature @xmath7 , etc . )",
    "are all mean state quantities which should use overbars but we ignore them for convenience .",
    "equation ( 5 ) describes the energy transport in the stellar interior by both turbulent motions(i.e .",
    "convection and overshooting ) and radiation .",
    "@xmath36 is the radiative temperature gradient .",
    "in the previous work @xcite , we applied the tcm in the solar overshooting region and found some properties of the overshooting region : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and the peak of @xmath2 , which are similar to xiongs(1985 ) and xiong & dengs(2001 ) works . in this section ,",
    "we attempt to get semi - analytical solutions of the tcm .",
    "some approximations are adopted to simplify eqs.(1 - 5 ) in the overshooting region :    _ approximation i_. pclet number @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",

    "approximation iii_. far away from the convective boundary , @xmath42 .",
    "this assumption is acceptable if the heat flux @xmath1 is small .      defining the anisotropic degree @xmath43 which is the ratio of radial kinetic energy to total kinetic energy , and applying _ approximation ii _ and eq.(5 ) , we can rewrite eq.(3 ) to : @xmath44 \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{l}\\overline{u_{r}'t'}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the last bracket in eq.(6 ) , _ approximation i_(@xmath39 ) makes the dissipation term @xmath45 be ignorable . and , by using eq.(5 ) and _ approximation ii _ , it is easy to find that the diffusion term is on the same order of the ignorable dissipation term : @xmath46 therefore the diffusion term is also ignorable .",
    "equation ( 3 ) is in local equilibrium : @xmath47 in the overshooting region , the most important process is the diffusion of the kinetic energy .",
    "thus , we ignore the diffusion of @xmath2(i.e . , setting @xmath48 ) .",
    "the solution of the tcm with @xmath48 can be thought as the zero - order solution of the tcm .",
    "ignoring the diffusion of @xmath2 and the diffusion and dissipation terms of @xmath49 , using _",
    "approximations i & ii _ , one can rewrite eqs.(1 - 4 ) as : @xmath50@xmath51@xmath52@xmath53 equation ( 9 ) results from eq.(1 ) and ( 2 ) , describing the equilibrium structure of the anisotropic degree @xmath3 .",
    "the left side is the diffusion of @xmath3 .",
    "the first term in the right side is the dissipation rate due to _ return to isotropy _ term in eq.(1 ) .",
    "the last term is the generation rate of @xmath3 due to the buoyancy .",
    "equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) show : @xmath54 the solution is @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "the latter is equivalent to @xmath57 . because @xmath1 is close to zero near the convective boundary and gradually decreases far away from the convective boundary@xcite ,",
    "the physically acceptable result is : @xmath58 equation ( 14 ) shows that there is an adiabatic stratification zone in the overshooting region in the case of @xmath48 . in order to investigate the property of heat transport in the overshooting region",
    ", we must know the length of the adiabatic stratification zone .",
    "it is found in eq.(14 ) that the boundary of the adiabatic stratification is the location where @xmath59 .",
    "solving the equation of @xmath3 is not easy because it is nonlinear .",
    "however , this problem is avoidable .",
    "turbulent motions are isotropic when @xmath60 . in the convection zone ,",
    "@xmath61 because the buoyancy boosts radial turbulent motion . in most part of overshooting region",
    ", @xmath3 should be less than @xmath62 because the buoyancy prevents radial turbulent motion",
    ". therefore @xmath3 should be not far away from @xmath62 near the convective boundary .",
    "further more , taking @xmath3 as a constant , one can rewrite eq.(10 ) as : @xmath63 substituting eq.(14 ) into the above equation , one can get the approximate solution : @xmath64if @xmath65 , and : @xmath66if @xmath67 .    in eq.(16 ) , point c , which is the convective boundary where @xmath68 , is set to be the initial point , @xmath6 and @xmath69 being @xmath0 and @xmath10 here . the contribution of the buoyancy term(i.e .",
    "the last term in eq.(15 ) ) is ignored in obtaining the solution eq.(16 ) . in the deep convection zone ,",
    "turbulent motions are almost in local equilibrium , thus the ratio of @xmath70 to @xmath71 is about 1 .",
    "however , near the convective boundary , buoyancy is about zero , meanwhile the diffusion of @xmath0 dominates .",
    "those make the ratio be much less than 1 .",
    "therefore the buoyancy term is ignorable .    in eq.(17 ) , point a , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 , is the boundary of the adiabatic overshooting region . in the region beyond point",
    "a , the ratio of @xmath70 to @xmath71 is @xmath74 which is on the order of @xmath75 , thus the buoyancy term remains .",
    "the exponentially decreasing function of @xmath0 is due to the fact that there is no generation in the overshooting region .",
    "contrary to the situation in the convection zone , the buoyancy dissipates @xmath0 because it prevents the radial motion of fluid elements in the overshooting region .",
    "the distribution of @xmath0 results from the equilibrium between the diffusion and the dissipation .",
    "@xmath0 should decrease faster if the buoyancy is as effective as the turbulent dissipation , which is found by comparing the exponential indices of eq.(16 ) and ( 17 ) .",
    "the location of point a is determined by @xmath76 . using eq.(16 ) , we get a property of point a : @xmath77 the relation between @xmath78 and @xmath79 is needed in order to solve this equation and to locate point a. near the convective boundary , there is : @xmath80 is the length of the adiabatic overshooting region , @xmath81 and @xmath82 the pressure at point a and c , and @xmath83 which is approximately a constant .    substituting eq.(19 ) into eq.(18 ) , one finds : @xmath84    @xmath85 can be worked out if @xmath6 is known . in the deep adiabatic convection zone ,",
    "turbulent diffusion is ignorable , and the localized tcm shows @xmath86 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "however , @xmath6 can not be estimated as that because @xmath87 thus @xmath88 at the convective boundary .",
    "actually , the turbulent diffusion of @xmath0 is effective near the convective boundary , and @xmath6 is determined by the diffusion .",
    "we can estimate @xmath6 by a simple approach which will be referred to as _ the maximum of diffusion _ hereafter . setting point b at where the diffusion becomes dominative in the convection zone",
    ", we get the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath89 by solving eq.(15 ) : @xmath90where @xmath91 .",
    "equation ( 21 ) shows that @xmath6 is a function of @xmath92 . in reality",
    ", the diffusion leads to the maximum of @xmath6 .",
    "therefore @xmath92 makes the derivation of the right side of equation ( 21 ) be zero . noting that @xmath93 is approximately proportional to @xmath94 , one can easily work out the location of point b : @xmath95 it is found in fig.1 that @xmath96 in the deep convection zone because the turbulent diffusion can be ignored here , and the turbulent diffusion dominates in the layer beyond point b.    using above results , we obtain : @xmath97 generally , @xmath98 is very small . according to eq.(20 ) , the length of the adiabatic overshooting region is : @xmath99 in the area @xmath100 in the overshooting region , the temperature gradient @xmath12 is almost equal to the adiabatic one . in the area @xmath101 , however , according to eq.(14 ) , eq.(17 ) , and eq.(5 ) , the temperature gradient @xmath12 is gradually close to @xmath36 : @xmath102\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although @xmath3 in eq.(24 ) and eq.(25 ) is still unknown , we can estimate it roughly . equation",

    "@xmath106 because the buoyancy is zero at the boundary , and @xmath107 because the diffusion of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore the typical value of @xmath104 can be taken as the average , i.e. @xmath108 . if eq.(25 ) is used in the region far away from the convective boundary(beyond the peak of @xmath2 ) , @xmath103 is not appropriate .",
    "one can use @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the equilibrium value of @xmath3 in the overshooting region which is introduced in the next subsection .",
    "another turbulent correlation is @xmath2 , which can be worked out by using eq.(11 ) : @xmath111 and : @xmath112 equation ( 26 ) seems to against cauchy s theorem @xmath113 . actually , @xmath114 is only an approximate solution on the order of ( @xmath115 ) , because eq.(8 ) is an approximation on that order .",

    "it is found that the effects of the diffusion of @xmath2 are only making @xmath12 be smoother . however , there is no adiabatic overshooting region when the diffusion of @xmath2 is present , because @xmath2 increases near the convective boundary due to the turbulent diffusion thus @xmath12 decreases according to eq.(8 ) .",
    "numerical results of the turbulent correlations in both @xmath48 and @xmath116 with different tcm parameters and for different stellar models are shown in figs.3 - 5 .",
    "it is found that the theoretical solutions well fit the numerical solutions in the case of @xmath48 .",
    "this also validates that the boundary value @xmath6 derived from _ the maximum of diffusion _ is a good approximation .",
    "the diffusion of @xmath2 modifies and smoothes the profile of @xmath2 and @xmath49 .",

    "the temperature of a turbulent element is gradually close to the temperature of the environment , and the efficiency of heat transport significantly decreases .",
    "therefore the area between the convective boundary and the location of the maximum of @xmath2 can be thought as the overshooting region of @xmath1 .",
    "it is found in figs.3 - 5 that the width of the valley of @xmath1 is approximately equal to the distance from the convective boundary to the location of the maximum of @xmath2 . in order to get the overshooting length of heat transport ,",

    "the diffusion of @xmath2 only modifies turbulent correlations to be smoother near the convective boundary .",
    "however , it makes more effects on turbulent motions in the overshooting region further than @xmath4 away from the convective boundary . in this subsection",
    ", we investigate the turbulence properties in the outer overshooting region(beyond @xmath4 ) .    in the numerical calculations of the tcm",
    ", we found that the anisotropic degree @xmath3 always showed an equilibrium value in the overshooting region .",

    "@xmath3 should be larger than @xmath62 in the convection zone because the buoyancy boosts radial movement of turbulent elements . actually , @xmath3 is almost equal to the equilibrium value in the convection zone @xmath136(see appendix a ) due to the equilibrium between the buoyancy and the _ return to isotropy _ term .",
    "when turbulent elements go across the convective boundary into the overshooting region , the buoyancy prevents convective elements moving , thus @xmath3 decreases to less than @xmath62 near the convective boundary .",

    "the fact that the buoyancy prevents the radial movement of turbulent elements in the overshooting region restricts the turbulent parameters to ensure @xmath148 .",
    "an important thing is where @xmath3 reaches its equilibrium value @xmath110 .",
    "according to eq.(9 ) , the equilibrium of @xmath3 can be realized only if the buoyancy term synchronically decreases with @xmath0 decreasing .",

    "we find that the asymptotic solution is the same as the results in the overshooting region with @xmath150 by setting @xmath109 in eq(14),(17 ) & ( 27 ) . because eq.(8 ) is correct whether @xmath48 or not , the conclusion that the maximum of @xmath2 is located at about @xmath4 is also correct in both cases .",
