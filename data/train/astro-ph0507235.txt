    "of more than 1500 currently known rotation - powered ( radio ) pulsars , 122 possess very short spin periods @xmath1 ms .",
    "these millisecond pulsars are generally believed to be very old neutron stars ( nss ) , spun up by accretion in binary systems , with characteristic ages @xmath210 gyr and low surface magnetic fields @xmath3@xmath4 g ( e.g. , taylor et al .",
    "1993 ) . as millisecond pulsars",
    "are intrinsically faint at optical wavelengths and most of them reside in binary systems with optically brighter white dwarf companions , x - ray energy range is the main source of information on these objects outside the radio band .",
    "so far firm x - ray detections have been reported for nine millisecond ( non - variable ) pulsars , either solitary or in binaries without interaction with companions .",
    "they are given in table  1 ( this list does not include x - ray emitting millisecond pulsars in the global clusters 47  tuc and ngc  6397 because of a lack of a detailed information on their x - ray properties  see , e.g. , grindlay et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "x - ray emission from radio pulsars consists of two different components , thermal and nonthermal ( see , e.g. , pavlov et al .  2002 , and kaspi et al .",
    "2006 for reviews ) .",
    "the nonthermal component is described by a power - law ( pl ) spectral model and attributed to radiation emitted from pulsar magnetosphere , whereas the thermal emission can originate from either the whole surface of a cooling ns or small hot spots around the magnetic poles ( polar caps ; pcs ) on the star surface , or both .",
    "as predicted by virtually all pulsar models , these pcs can be heated up to x - ray temperatures ( @xmath5 mk ) by relativistic particles generated in pulsar acceleration zones . in the case of millisecond pulsars , the entire surface at a ns age of @xmath5 gyr is too cold , @xmath6 mk , to be detectable in x - rays ( although it may be seen in @xmath7  see  2 ) .",
    "therefore , only nonthermal and/or thermal pc radiation is expected to be observed in x - rays from these objects .",
    "the pulsars presented in table  1 can be divided in two distinct groups ( see also kuiper & hermsen 2004 ) .",
    "the first group consists of psrs b1937 + 21 , b1957 + 20 , j0218 + 4232 , and b182124 , with high rotational energy losses , @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 , and estimated x - ray luminosities , @xmath10 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "their x - ray emission is of a nonthermal origin , with pure pl spectra of photon index @xmath112 and pulsed profiles with strong narrow peaks and large pulsed fractions , @xmath12 ( see references in table  1 ) .",
    "probably , psr  j0751 + 1807 can also be associated with this group because its spectrum is better fitted with a pl model of @xmath13 .",
    "three other pulsars , j04374715 , j0030 + 0451 and j21243358 , with lower spin - down energies , @xmath14 erg s@xmath9 , belong to the second group .",
    "x - ray emission from these nss shows significant contribution of a thermal component , with smoother pulsations and lower pulsed fractions .",
    "the properties of x - rays detected from psr  j1012 + 5307 are rather uncertain .",
    "however , there is an indication of a thermal component in its x - ray flux .",
    "current theoretical models are not elaborate enough to predict in which millisecond pulsars the thermal pc component would prevail over the nonthermal one .",
    "it , however , seems certain that both the thermal and nonthermal luminosities should increase with rotational energy loss @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , only analysis of x - ray observations can help in elucidating the radiative properties of millisecond pulsars .",
    "the high sensitivity and spectral resolution of @xmath16 and  provide new opportunities for studying x - ray emission from faint celestial objects .",
    "this paper presents an analysis and interpretation of new  observations of four millisecond pulsars , j04374715 , j2124 - 3358 , j10240719 , and j0034 - 0534 (   25 ) .",
    "the obtained results are summarized and discussed in  6 .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    this is the nearest and x - ray brightest millisecond pulsar known .",
    "it is in a 5.7 d binary orbit with a low - mass white dwarf companion .",
    "its pulsed x - ray emission was first detected with @xmath17 in the 0.12 kev range ( becker & trmper 1993 ) .",
    "those data could be fitted with either a single pl model of @xmath18 , suggesting a nonthermal origin of the detected emission , or a thermal pc model consisting of two opposite pcs covered with nonmagnetic hydrogen atmosphere and temperature decreasing from @xmath19 mk in the pc `` core '' of about @xmath20 km radius to @xmath21 mk in the pc `` rim '' of a @xmath22 km radius ( zavlin & pavlov 1998 ) .",
    "becker & trmper ( 1993 ) found that pulsed fraction @xmath23 of the pulsar flux increases with photon energy @xmath24 from about 30% at @xmath25 kev up to about 50% at 1 kev ( although becker & trmper 1999 found no energy dependence of @xmath23 from a later @xmath17 observation of ) . on the other hand ,",
    "thermal emission from ns atmospheres is essentially anisotropic , even at low @xmath26 , with radiation intensities beamed stronger at higher @xmath24 ( zavlin et al .",
    "1996 ) , that can result in an increase of @xmath23 with photon energy . therefore , if the energy dependence of @xmath23 found by becker & trmper ( 1993 ) is real , it could be regarded as an additional indication of the thermal origin of the detected radiation .",
    "the pulsar was also observed with @xmath16 .",
    "analysis of the combined @xmath17 and @xmath16 data ( zavlin et al .",
    "2002 ) showed that the 0.17 kev spectrum of  can not be described with a simple one - component model and requires two components : a nonthermal pl spectrum of @xmath27 and a thermal pc model similar to that suggested by zavlin & pavlov ( 1998 ) from the @xmath17 data alone .",
    "the thermal ( bolometric ) and nonthermal ( in 0.210 kev ) luminosities were found to be @xmath28 erg s@xmath9 and @xmath29 erg s@xmath9 ( for a distance @xmath30 kpc  see table  1 ) , respectively . in this interpretation",
    ", the nonthermal component dominates at energies @xmath0 kev .",
    "the @xmath16 data provided also an energy - integrated pulse profile with @xmath31 and the x - ray peak at the same phase as the radio peak .",
    "in addition ,  is the only millisecond pulsar detected near the optical , at the wavelengths @xmath321702 ( kargaltsev et al .",
    "2004 ) , that provided an estimate on the temperature of the entire ns surface , @xmath33 mk  surprisingly high for such an old ns , implying special heating mechanism(s ) to operate in this pulsar .      was observed with  on 2002 october 9 ( orbit 519 ) for 68.3 and 67.2 ks effective exposures with the epic - mos and epic - pn instruments , respectively .",
    "epic - mos1 and mos2 were operated in full frame mode providing an image of an area of a @xmath34 radius and a time resolution of 2.6 s. epic - pn was in timing mode . in this mode",
    "only one epic - pn ccd is in use and the epic - pn image is collapsed in one - dimensional ( 1-d ) count distribution in the direction perpendicular to the ccd read - out , that provides a 0.03 ms time resolution suitable for detecting pulsations in x - ray flux of millisecond pulsars .",
    "thin filters were used for each epic instrument .",
    "the epic data were processed with the most recent sas package ( ver .",

    "is the second brightest source in the filed of view .",
    "the epic - pn field of view is also shown in figure  1 , as well as the direction of the ccd read - out .",
    "it is evident that the satellite position angle ( @xmath36 ) chosen for observing  was not optimal , which led to a partial contamination of the pulsar data in the 1-d epic - pn image by the much brighter neighboring agn .",
    "this resulted in an asymmetric shape of the 1-d distribution of epic - pn counts shown in the upper panel of figure  2 . to evaluate the contamination , we constructed three 1-d images from the epic - mos data confined within the epic - pn field of view with the same column width of @xmath37 as in the epic - pn ccd : from the areas above and below the short - dashed line in figure  1 , which contain negligible fractions of pulsar and agn quanta ( respectively ) , and from the total area .",
    "examination of these three distributions plotted in the lower panel of figure  2 shows that the contamination of the pulsar is insignificant in the ccd columns below # 40 , which were used for the analysis below .",
    "both epic - mos spectra of  were extracted from circles of a @xmath38 radius centered at the pulsar position , each containing about 82% of all detected source counts .",
    "background was estimated from a few source - free regions .",
    "the extracted spectra were binned with at least 30 source counts per bin .",
    "the estimated total count rates of the pulsar are @xmath39 and @xmath40 counts ks@xmath9 in the 0.3 - 10 kev range for the epic - mos1 and mos2 detectors , respectively ( energies below 0.3 kev were not used because of uncertainties in the epic - mos calibration ) .",
    "the epic - pn spectrum was extracted from the ccd columns # 2839 , what provides about 85% of all detected source counts .",

    "the total source count rate was measured to be @xmath41 counts ks@xmath9 in the 0.310 kev range ( there is no spectral information below 0.3 kev in the epic - pn detector in timing mode ) .",
    "all instrument response matrices and effective areas were generated with the sas tools _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen _ ( these tools were also used in analysis of all  data discussed in this paper )",
    ". the source count rates in the reflection grating spectrometers , @xmath42 counts ks@xmath9 , are too low for a meaningful analysis of this data .    applying a simple one - component model to",
    "the three combined epic spectra resulted in unreasonable model parameters and unacceptable fit quality . a best single ( absorbed ) pl fit results in a photon index of @xmath43 and absorbing hydrogen column density of @xmath44 ( vs. the estimate @xmath450.3 obtained from independent measurements",
    " see zavlin & pavlov 1998 ) , with the minimum value of @xmath46 ( for @xmath47 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "even worse fit is yielded by a one - temperature thermal model , e.g. , @xmath48 for a single blackbody ( bb ) spectrum , because of a large data excess at energies @xmath49 kev . a two - component model , bb+pl , results in @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "with account for problems in the cross - calibration of the epic instruments it can be considered as a reasonably good fit . in this model",
    "the pl component with @xmath52 provides about 70% of the observed x - ray flux ( @xmath53 erg s@xmath9 @xmath54 in 0.210 kev ) . however , the obtained value of @xmath55 still significantly exceeds the independent estimates on the hydrogen column density .",
    "in addition , the inferred photon index is much larger than @xmath56 found in nonthermal emission from other radio ( including millisecond ones ) pulsars .",
    "a similar problem arises when one - temperature pc model with hydrogen atmosphere is applied .",
    "hence , we regard this model as rather infeasible .",
    "the next option is a pc model with a nonuniform temperature distribution combined with a pl component . applying the `` core''+``rim '' model for two pcs covered with a hydrogen atmosphere ( zavlin et al .",
    "1996 ) and assuming standard ns mass @xmath57 and radius @xmath58 km yields level for one interesting parameter . ] @xmath59 mk and @xmath60 mk ( unredshifted values ) , @xmath61 km and @xmath62 km , and @xmath63 , for @xmath64 varying between 0.1 and 0.3 , with the minimal value of @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "formally , according to an @xmath67-test , the probability that the spectral data on  require a two - temperature pc model ( instead of a one - temperature thermal component ) is 99.99992% .",
    "this model implies equal angles @xmath68 ( between the line - of - sight and pulsar spin axis ) and @xmath69 ( between the magnetic and spin axes ) of @xmath70 .",
    "figure  3 presents a best fit with this two - component model .",
    "the estimated bolometric luminosity of two pcs is @xmath71 erg s@xmath9 , and the pl luminosity in 0.210 kev is @xmath72 erg s@xmath9 . changing the pulsar geometry ( angles @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) as well as the ns mass - to - radius ratio in a plausible range @xmath73@xmath74 responsible for the gravitational effects ( redshift and bending of photon trajectories ) increases the errors in the pc parameters , but insignificantly it affects the inferred thermal luminosity ( see zavlin & pavlov 2004 for more details ) .",
    "generally , the spectral results obtained from the epic data are in good agreement with those derived from the previous observations .",
    "another hypothesis is that the pulsar spectrum is of a pure nonthermal origin with the pl slope changing somewhere in the x - ray range . to verify this ,",
    "a broken pl model was applied to the epic spectra , that yielded a best fit with @xmath75 , and photon indices @xmath76 and @xmath77 below and above the break energy @xmath78 kev ( @xmath79 for @xmath51 ) .",
    "however , this model significantly overpredicts the @xmath7 fluxes detected from   ( kargaltsev et al .",
    "this , together with the large value of the interstellar absorption inferred in the fit , makes the broken - pl interpretation rather implausible .      for the timing analysis",
    ", we used 38393 counts extracted from the epic - pn ccd columns # 3539 in the 0.3 - 6 kev range chosen to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "of those counts , 88% belong to the pulsar .",
    "the photon arrival times were transformed to the solar system barycenter with the _ barycen _ tool of the sas package ( this procedure was also applied to all other timing data discussed in this paper ) .",
    "as timing parameters of millisecond pulsars are known to be very stable , we invoked the binary ephemeris parameters from zavlin et al .",
    "these parameters used in the @xmath81 test ( @xmath82 is number of harmonics  see buccheri et al .",
    "1983 ) yielded the most significant value @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath85 is reached at a frequency @xmath86 which differs from the radio value by @xmath87 @xmath88hz , corresponding to a relative accuracy , @xmath89 , consistent with that estimated for the epic - pn timing .",
    "we extracted the pulsed profiles of  in five energy ranges , 0.30.5 , 0.50.8 , 0.8 - 2 , 0.32 kev , and 2 - 6 kev , which are given in figure  4 together with estimated values of pulsed fraction @xmath23 .",
    "the statistical @xmath90 test described in zavlin & pavlov ( 1998 ) shows that the shapes of the three lower - energy light curves are actually the same ( the probability that they are different is less than 90% ) .",
    "however , the 26 kev light curve seems to be more symmetric , with a peak apparently narrower than those in the lower - energy pulse profiles .",
    "one may also speculate that there is a phase shift of @xmath91 between the peaks at energies below and above 2 kev .",
    "this apparent difference is supported by the same statistical test yielding a fairly high probability of 99.99997% ( or a 4.2@xmath92 significance ) that the shapes of the 0.32 and 26 kev pulse profiles are different .",
    "another feature in the extracted light curves is the change of the source intrinsic pulsed fraction with energy : @xmath23 increases by about 10% from @xmath93 at the lowest energies to @xmath94 at @xmath95 kev , similar to the energy behavior of @xmath23 first found by becker & trmper ( 1993 ) from the @xmath17 data .",
    "the estimated pulsed fraction at @xmath96 kev is less certain because of a scantier statistics and strong background contamination at higher energies , although it may be as high as @xmath97 .",
    "generally , the energy dependence of the pulsar light curves can be attributed to different emission mechanisms producing the x - ray flux of , as suggested by the thermal - plus - nonthermal model .",
    "figure  5 shows the pulse profiles of  obtained from the @xmath17 position sensitive proportional counter , @xmath16 high resolution camera ( see zavlin et al .",
    "2002 ) and  epic - pn data ( in 0.36 kev ) .",
    "the pulsed fractions in the latter two light curves are similar to each other and somewhat larger than that found in the @xmath17 data .",
    "this may be explained by both the properties of the pulsar emission ( increase of @xmath23 with energy ) and the greater sensitivity of the  and @xmath16 instruments to higher - energy photons .",
    "the shapes of these three light curves are clearly asymmetric , with a longer rise .",
    "this asymmetry could be caused by contribution of the nonthermal component ( more than 10% at all energies ) whose peak is shifted in phase with respect to the pulse of the thermal emission .",
    "as the error in the epic - pn absolute timing can be as large as 0.5 ms , the phasing between the radio and x - ray peaks was not attempted ( this is also one of the reasons why the zero phases in fig .  5 are arbitrary ) .      in principle , the epic - pn data on  allow one to perform a phase - resolved spectroscopy of the pulsar emission . to do this",
    ", we extracted the pulsar spectra in five equal intervals between the rotational phases 0 and 1 , with the zero - phase as in figures  4 and 5 , from the same ccd columns chosen for the phase - integrated spectrum (  2.2 ) .",
    "the spectra were binned to collect at least 50 source counts per bin .",
    "a simplest and broadly used approach is to fit the phase - resolved spectra with the same model to determine the dependences of model parameters on rotational phase .",
    "based on the results of  2.2 , we applied the two - temperature pc ( `` core''+``rim '' ) plus pl model with temperatures of the thermal components and photon index fixed at the best values derived for the phase - integrated spectrum .",
    "the hydrogen column density was also fixed at @xmath98 .",
    "figure  6 shows phase dependences of the three fitting parameters , sizes of the pcs and nonthermal flux , normalized by the corresponding values found in the phase - integrated spectral analysis .",
    "the former two represent the pc areas projected onto a plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight of a distant observer .",
    "as it could be expected , these two dependences are very similar to each other and resemble the shape of the lower - energy light curves ( at @xmath99 kev ) shown in figure  4 . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase dependence of the nonthermal flux clearly differs from those of the pc areas , with a narrower peak shifted with respect to the maxima in the pc phase dependences , indicating that the shift between the peaks in the pulsed profiles of   extracted at energies below and above 2 kev ( fig .",
    "4 ) is real . also , the modulation of the nonthermal flux is rather large , by about 60% , pointing to a high intrinsic pulsed fraction of the nonthermal component .",
    "more detailed information could be obtained from combining the phase - resolved spectroscopy with modeling the pulsar light curves .",
    "however , such an analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    x - ray emission from this solitary pulsar was first detected with @xmath17 ( becker & trmper 1999 ) .",

    "about 70 counts detected from this source with the two epic - mos detectors at @xmath212 kev can be equally well fitted with a single pl spectrum of @xmath213 or a single bb model of @xmath214 mk and @xmath215 km ( for @xmath216 kpc ) .",

    ", the new data confirmed the main result obtained from the previous observations that the pulsar spectrum is best fitted with a two - temperature pcs model with nonmagnetic hydrogen atmosphere plus a nonthermal ( pl ) component which contributes mainly at energies @xmath0 kev . in this interpretation , the pc temperature changes from about @xmath19 mk in the pc `` core '' of a @xmath21 km radius down to @xmath218 mk in the pc `` rim '' of a @xmath219 km radius .",
    "the  data allowed us to investigate the energy - resolved pulse profiles in a broad range of @xmath2016 kev , as well as perform phase - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "this analysis showed that the pulse shape is different at lower and higher energies ( below and above @xmath220 kev ) , with pulsed fraction @xmath23 increasing by about 10% in the 0.32 kev range where the thermal emission dominates .",
    "this increase of @xmath23 can be explained by the anisotropic properties of radiation emitted from a ns hydrogen atmosphere ( see zavlin et al .",
    "1996 , and zavlin & pavlov 1998 for more details ) .",
    "the pulsed fraction in the light curve extracted at energies above 2 kev is rather large , @xmath221 .",
    "in addition , the peak in the pulse profile obtained at higher energies is narrower than the pulse in the low - energy light curve and shifted by about 0.1 in phase .",
    "these properties provide strong evidence that two different emission mechanisms generate the x - ray emission of .",
    "the  spectral data on  can be most plausibly interpreted as either a combination of a one - temperature pc model plus a nonthermal pl spectrum or a pure thermal radiation from pcs with a nonuniform temperature decreasing from @xmath220 mk to @xmath218 mk in the `` core '' and `` rim '' areas of the pcs , similar to that derived for . comparing the pc radii inferred in these two approaches",
    " about 0.3 km with the pc - plus - pl combination and 12 km in the two - temperature pc model  with the canonical estimate of pulsar models , @xmath222 km for ( assuming the ns radius @xmath58 km ) , suggests that the pure thermal interpretation is preferable . in any case , the thermal luminosities derived in these model fits differ insignificantly , by only a factor of @xmath220 .",
    "in addition , the new data allowed us to firmly detect pulsations of the x - ray flux of at the radio pulsar period , although the shape of the obtained pulse profile can not be interpreted unambiguously .",
    "it may be described as a profile with two peaks of different heights separated by about 0.35 ( or 0.65 ) in phase .",
    "if so , it would suggest that two different components are detected in the pulsar emission . on the other hand",
    ", it could be a broad single peak produced by thermal pc emission with a shape distorted by the relativistic effects in fast rotating nss .    for",
    ", the  observation provided the first firm detection of the pulsar x - ray emission .",
    "although the obtained statistics is much poorer than that delivered in the observations of  and , especially , it has shown that the pulsar s spectrum is best described as a pure thermal radiation emitted from pcs with either uniform or nonuniform ( `` core''+``rim '' ) temperature .",
    "the derived total thermal luminosity is almost independent on assumption about the pc temperature distribution .",
    "in addition to the spectral analysis , the new data revealed pulsations of the pulsar x - ray flux at a highly significant level .",
    "most likely , the pulsar light curves shows a single broad pulse per rotational period , although much better statistics is required to draw more definitive conclusions on the pulse shape .    regarding the  observation of , only a possible x - ray counterpart of the pulsar could be suggested based on the very close proximity of this source to the pulsar position .",
    "a longer observation , with a proper satellite position angle , is needed to perform a meaningful investigation of x - ray radiation of this pulsar .    with a sample of millisecond pulsars showing thermal pc emission available ( see table  2 ) , it is natural to compare observational properties of the pc radiation , first of all , the luminosities , with those predicted by pulsar models . a most recent and detailed analysis of pc heating is presented in harding & muslimov ( 2001 , 2002 ) who modified the space charge limited flow model by arons ( 1981 ) to account for the relativistic effects and electric field screening above the ns surface . in these models",
    "the pc heating is produced by inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of thermal x - rays from the ns surface by primary electrons accelerated in the pulsar magnetosphere , as well as by positrons generated through curvature radiation ( cr ) and returning to the ns surface from the upper pair formation front .",
    "these authors showed that the pc heating from the cr pair fronts dominates for most pulsars except those with very short spin periods and low magnetic fields ( see fig .  1 in harding & muslimov 2002 ) because the latter objects can not produced cr pairs .",
    "therefore , the ics is the only mechanism to heat pcs of millisecond pulsars .",
    "harding & muslimov ( 2002 ) calculated the `` pc efficiency '' of one pc , @xmath223 , for typical parameters of millisecond pulsars ( age @xmath22410 gyr , spin period @xmath2255 ms ) .",
    "this model predicts @xmath226 ranging between about @xmath227 and @xmath228 for pcs with temperatures @xmath2293 mk ( see fig .  8 in harding & muslimov 2002 ) . comparing these estimates with those derived from the observations",
    "( table  2 ) shows that the maximum predicted value of @xmath230 is lower by a factor of 10 than the results obtained for psrs j04374715 and j0030 + 0451 , and a factor of 6 for .",
    "this difference is larger for psr  j1012 + 5307 , but we note that the @xmath226 value given in table  2 for this pulsar was obtained under assumption that all x - ray flux detected from psr  j1012 + 5307 is of a thermal origin . for , the value of @xmath230 well agrees with the observational result . on the other hand , the predicted pc luminosities , @xmath231@xmath232 erg s@xmath9 for @xmath229 mk and up to @xmath233 erg s@xmath9 for @xmath234 mk ( see fig .",
    "9 in harding & muslimov 2002 ) , are in much better agreement with those estimated for the objects listed in table  2 .",
    "to conclude , the pc heating from ics pairs is a promising model for interpreting properties of thermal pc emission observed from millisecond pulsars .    finally ,",
    "as mentioned in  1 , there is no clear understanding yet at which conditions the thermal pc component is expected to dominate over the nonthermal one in x - ray radiation of millisecond pulsars .",
    "saito et al .  ( 1997 ) first suggested that high luminosity of the nonthermal emission may be associated with large values of the magnetic field at the pulsar light cylinder , @xmath235 ^ 3 $ ] ( @xmath236 ) .",
    "indeed , the four pulsars emitting pure nonthermal emission , psrs b1937 + 21 , b1957 + 20 , b182124 , and j0218 + 4232 ( see  1 and table  1 ) , possess magnetic fields , @xmath237@xmath238 g , close to that of the crab pulsar ( @xmath239 g ) and exceeding those in the millisecond pulsars with thermal emission , @xmath240@xmath241 g , at least by an order of magnitude .",
    "this provides a strong indication that the nonthermal emission of millisecond pulsars is generated in emission zone(s ) close to the light cylinder ( as predicted by the outer - gap pulsar models  see , e.g. , cheng et al .",
