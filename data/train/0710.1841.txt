    ". however , the small ensemble of transiting exoplanets ( teps ) does not allow robust conclusions , thus the addition of new discoveries is valuable .    over the past year",
    "the hatnet project @xcite , a wide - angle photometric survey , has announced four teps . in this letter",
    "we report on the detection of a new transiting exoplanet , which we label hat - p-5b , and our determination of its parameters , such as mass , radius , density and surface gravity .",

    "it was initially identified as a transit candidate in our internally labeled field g196 , centered at @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the data were acquired by hatnet s hat-7 telescope at the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) of the smithsonian astrophysical observatory ( sao ) and hat-9 telescope at the submillimeter array ( sma ) site atop mauna kea , hawaii . following the standard calibration procedure of the frames ,",
    "data were reduced using the astrometry code of @xcite , and a highly fine - tuned aperture photometry .",
    "we applied our external parameter decorrelation ( epd ) technique on the light curves , whereby deviations from the median were cross - correlated with a number of `` external parameters '' , such as the @xmath13 and @xmath14 sub - pixel position , fwhm , hour - angle , and zenith distance .",

    "the length of the transit as determined from this joint fit is @xmath6d ( 2 hours , 55 minutes ) , the length of ingress is @xmath39d ( 20.9 minutes ) , and the central transit depth is 0.0136mag .",

    "in order to determine the stellar properties needed to place @xmath56  and @xmath57  on an absolute scale , we made use of stellar evolution models along with the observational constraints from spectroscopy .",
    "because of its relative faintness , the host star does not have a parallax measurement from _ hipparcos _ , and thus a direct estimate of the absolute magnitude is not available for use as a constraint .",
    "an alternative approach is to use the surface gravity of the star , which is a sensitive measure of the evolutionary state of the star and therefore has a very strong influence on the radius .",
    "however , @xmath58 is a notoriously difficult quantity to measure spectroscopically and is often strongly correlated with other spectroscopic parameters ( see ) .",
    "it has been pointed out by @xcite that the normalized separation of the planet , @xmath59 , can provide a much better constraint for stellar parameter determination than @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath59 quantity can be determined directly from the photometric observations with no additional assumptions ( other than limb - darkening , which is a second - order effect ) , and it is related to the density of the central star .",
    "as discussed later in , an analytic fit to the light curve yields @xmath60 .",
    "this value , along with @xmath19 and [ fe / h ] from , was compared with the yonsei - yale stellar evolution models of @xcite following @xcite . as described earlier ,",
    "the initial temperature and metallicity from our ds spectroscopy were subsequently improved by applying the @xmath20 constraint from the models , and the isochrone comparison was repeated .",
    "this resulted in final values for the stellar mass and radius of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and an estimated age of @xmath63gyr .",
    "we summarize these and other properties in .",
    "our 8 rv measurements from sophie were fitted with a keplerian orbit model solving for the velocity semi - amplitude @xmath64 and the center - of - mass velocity @xmath65 , holding the period and transit epoch fixed at the well - determined values from photometry .",
    "the eccentricity was initially set to zero .",
    "the resulting rms residual of @xmath1523.7  m  s@xmath66 is somewhat larger than expected from the internal errors , and we find that a reduced @xmath67 value of unity necessitates the addition of uncorrelated noise of 14.4  m  s@xmath66 in quadrature , which we attribute to `` stellar jitter '' .",
    "this level of jitter is consistent with the predictions of @xcite for a projected rotational velocity such as what we measure for the parent star .",
    "the final fit , with the internal errors increased as described above , yields @xmath68@xmath29  and @xmath69@xmath29 .",
    "the observations and fitted rv curve are displayed in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rv ] , with the residuals shown in the middle panel .    as a test we allowed for the possibility of an eccentric orbit and solved for the two additional quantities @xmath70 and @xmath71 , but the results were insignificantly different from zero .",
    "we have tested the reality of the velocity variations by carefully examining the spectral line bisectors of the star using our ohp data .",
    "if the velocity changes measured are due only to distortions in the line profiles arising from contamination of the spectrum by the presence of a binary with a period of 2.79 days , we would expect the bisector spans ( which measure line asymmetry ) to vary with this period and with an amplitude similar to the velocities ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rv ] , the changes in the bisector spans are of the same order as the residual rv variations , and much smaller than the radial velocity semi - amplitude itself .",

    "this amounts to an orthogonalization of the fitted parameters , similar ( albeit simpler ) to the one employed by @xcite for the case of xo-2b .",

    "* ) to derive the best fit parameters .",
    "uncertainties were estimated using synthetic data sets , by added gaussian noise to the fitted curve at the dates of our observations , and re - solving the light curve  analytic fit .",
    "the magnitude of the noise was taken from the white- and red - noise estimations based on the real residuals .",
    "this process was repeated @xmath116 times , yielding a good representation of the _ a posteriori _ distribution of the best - fit parameter values .",
    "we found this method of error estimation to be robust , since it is not sensitive to the number of out - of - transit ( oot ) points .",
    "the result for the radius ratio is @xmath117 , and the normalized separation is @xmath118 .",
    "we found that the _ a posteriori _ distribution of @xmath113 is consistent with a symmetric gaussian distribution , and yields @xmath119 , therefore the orbit is inclined . from the inclination ,",
    "the mass of the star ( ) , and the orbital parameters ( ) , the other planetary parameters ( such as mass , radius ) are derived in a straightforward way , and are summarized in .",
    "we note that @xmath59 , as derived from the light curve  fit , is an important constraint in the stellar parameter determination ( ) , which in turn defines the limb - darkening coefficients that are used in the light curve  analytic fit .",
    "thus , after the initial analytic fit to the light curve  and the stellar parameter determination , we performed another iteration in the light curve  fit .",
    "we found that the change in parameters was imperceptible .",
    "the possibility of transit time variations ( ttvs ) was checked by fitting the center of the transit of the five full transit events independently .",
