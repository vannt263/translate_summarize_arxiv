    "near infrared observations ( @xmath10 ) are discovering a growing number of molecular hydrogen outflows from young stellar objects ( ysos ) that , in many cases are not detected at optical wavelengths .",
    "some of the most spectacular examples of these objects are herbig - haro ( hh ) 211 ( mccaughrean et al . 1994 ) and l1448 ( see e.g. davis et al . 1994c , and references therein ) .",
    "for a few objects the optical and h@xmath2 jets are detected and display a similar morphology , as e.g. in hh 111 ( gredel & reipurth 1993 ) and hh 1 - 2 ( davis et al . 1994a ; noriega - crespo & garnavich 1994a ) .",
    "the h@xmath2 jets seem to have properties intermediate to those of the collimated optical jets and the broader co molecular outflows : they resemble the jets , but they trace warm ( @xmath11 k ) molecular gas . because of this they could provide important clues on the interdependence between the atomic and molecular bipolar outflows , at least in the objects where they appear simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , the emission from the h@xmath2 jets could be driven by the dissipation of energy in a turbulent mixing layer ( cant & raga 1991 ) and not by shocks , where the emission arises at the recombination regions .    in this paper",
    "we report the discovery of yet another h@xmath2 jet invisible at optical wavelengths found during our recent investigation of the kinematics and structure of the hh 110 ( noriega - crespo et al .",
    "the presence of the jet was already inferred from earlier narrow band h@xmath2 2.121  images of the hh110 region by davis et al .",
    "( 1994b ) , but given their signal - to - noise and resolution it was impossible to say anything concrete about its structure .",
    "they identified two bright k - band sources some 50  west of hh110 knot - a and labeled the southern and northern emission irs1 and irs2 respectively .",
    "k - band imaging of irs1/2 was also performed by reipurth and olberg ( 1991 ) while searching for the energy source of hh110 .",
    "they matched irs1 with the far - infrared source iras  05487 + 0255 based on its positional coincidence , but concluded that it was very unlikely to be the source that drives the hh110 jet .",
    "this paper presents improved near infrared images of the new jets associated with irs1 and irs2 as well as spectroscopic observations in the 2  band of both the irs2 jet and counter - jet .",
    "the high degree of collimation of the molecular hydrogen emission may be indicating a different excitation mechanism than those we have considered in the past ( as e.g in internal working surfaces ) .",
    "we have estimated the jet radial velocities and reddening from their spectra .",
    "the observations are reported in  2 and the results are summarized in  3 .",
    "the near infrared images were obtained at the 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory on january 14 - 16 , 1996 , with grim ii imager which has a risc 256@xmath12256 detector array .",
    "the @xmath13 optics provide a scale of 0 . per pixel and a field of view of two arcminutes .",
    "the filters were centered at the wavelength of the molecular hydrogen v = 1@xmath140 s(1 ) 2.121  line and nearby continuum at 2.22 , with fwhm transmission of 1% and 4% respectively .",
    "the 2.12  images were created by a mosaic of 18 spatially contiguous frames , with integration times of 180 seconds per frame . the continuum image ( 2.22 )",
    "was created from 12 integrations of 40 seconds each .",
    "the fwhm resolution was between 1  @xmath141 .",
    "the data were reduced in the following way .",
    "mean dark frames with an exposure times corresponding to the science images were subtracted from each exposure and the result divided by normalized flat field frames constructed from images of the illuminated dome .",
    "a sky frame was created by removing the bright emission objects from each data frame ( substituting the average local sky ) and taking a median of the images after adjusting for slight differences in the overall sky level . the sky frame",
    "was then scaled and divided into each data image .",
    "the images were then magnified , shifted by an integer number of magnified pixels to align the stellar images and combined using a sigma - clipping algorithm .",
    "the final image was then demagnified to the same scale as the original frames .",
    "a k band spectrum of the irs2 jet was obtained with the rieke fspec ir spectrometer ( 256@xmath15 nicmos detector ) and mmt on 1996 february 10 . a 75 line",
    "/ mm grating was used that provided spectral coverage from 1.98 to 2.42  with a resolution of 34  fwhm .",
    "the slit was aligned with the jet axis at a pa=@xmath16 and alternate exposures were chopped between the source and the local sky .",
    "the atmospheric absorption and sensitivity variation along the dispersion was corrected by observing bright late - f type stars at nearly the same airmass as the target data .",
    "the wavelength solution was determined using the oh sky lines from the raw images .",
    "longward of 2.3  there are few bright sky lines and the accuracy of the calibration is reduced at the red end of the spectrum .",
    "since spectra of both the north and south sides of the jet were obtained on the same exposures , the relative velocities between the jet and counter - jet are limited by the quality of the line centroids . for the strong 2.12  line",
    "this gives an uncertainty of about 50 .",
    "the spectra were obtained with a 1.0   wide slit , and the extraction was done over an area of 4.0 and 7.2 square arcseconds for the north and south sections of the jet respectively .",
    "the line intensities were computed with these areas , and these were used to obtain the h@xmath2 column densities by applying @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the line intensity , @xmath19 the wavenumber ( from dabrowski 1984 ) and @xmath20 the transition probability ( from turner et al 1977 ) .",
    "table 2 contains the fluxes , intensities , and column densities for those lines detected in both the red - shifted north ( top ) and blue - shifted south ( bottom ) jet components .",
    "the h@xmath2 2.121  image around the iras 05487 + 0255 region is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the astrometry was performed under the assumption that the optical positions for hh 110 a , b and e along with that from reference star 1 ( reipurth & olberg 1991 ) are known .",
    "irs2 is seen to be a parabolic - shaped nebula surrounding a narrow jet ( 11 ) extending to the south .",
    "this new h@xmath2 jet also has northern component ( 9 ) which can be traced for more than 40  from a dark lane between the jets ( 10 ) that is likely obscuring the driving source .",
    "the continuum - subtracted image ( figure  2 ) shows only the jets , proving that we see the jets emit narrow molecular lines while the parabolic nebula is dominated by scattered continuum light .",
    "the position for the iras 05487 + 0255 source and its _ uncertainty ellipse _ are also shown in figure  1 .",
    "the uncertainty ellipse encloses the true position of the source with a 95% confidence ( beichman et al .",
    "if this is the case then iras 05487 + 0255 does not seem to be driving any obvious outflow in the region and is not irs1 as surmised by reipurth and olberg ( 1991 ) . near the published position of iras 05487 + 0255 , @xmath21 = 5@xmath22 48@xmath23 46@xmath24 @xmath25",
    "= 2  55  10 , there is a faint source marked ( 7 ) , with @xmath21 = 5@xmath22 48@xmath23 47@xmath26.03 @xmath25 = 2  55  11.1 .",
    "the similarity between their positions could be more than a curious and fortuitous coincidence .",
    "a third jet arises from the bright stellar source irs1 ( 15 ) , where there is a beam - like emission within @xmath27  from the star .",
    "aligned with this emission are two fainter knots 15  and 20   farther south ( 12 and 13 ) .",
    "there is no evidence of a counter - jet to the north of irs1 .",
    "the k - band spectra of the northern and southern irs2 jets are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the wavelength of the expected h@xmath2 lines in this band are marked , but given its signal - to - noise only a few lines can be considered as unambiguously detected ( see table 2 ) .",
    "we have used these lines to determine the excitation temperature of the warm molecular gas , and to measure the radial velocities of both jet components .",
    "the excitation temperature is obtained by assuming , as a first approximation , that the h@xmath2 rotational - vibrational levels have equilibrium populations following a boltzmann distribution .",
    "the excitation energy or temperature @xmath28 then comes from @xmath29 , and such that @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the statistical weight .",
    "the linear least square fit to the six lines for both jet and counter - jet ( table 2 and figure 4 ) yields the following values @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the blue and red - shifted jets respectively .",
    "these temperatures are below the excitation temperatures measured in other hh objects ( gredel 1994 ) of @xmath11 k. the flux of the 2 - 1 s(1 ) 2.24  line is uncertain , but permits an estimate of the vibrational excitation temperature , and considering only the v = @xmath32 vibrational transitions ( without the v = @xmath33 line ) would be a measurement of the _ rotational _ excitation temperature .",
    "these results reflect , however , the difficulty in performing such calculations using few lines and the need for higher quality spectra .    for some time it has been a goal of many of us to try to determine the dominant excitation mechanism of h@xmath2 in these objects , with uv ( fluorescence ) or collisional ( shock ) excitation , as the most likely competing processes ( see e.g. wolfire & knigl 1991 ) . the most direct way to differentiate between these mechanisms has been to use the 2@xmath141 s(1 ) 2.247  to 1@xmath140 s(1 ) 2.121  ratio .",
    "the models predict ratios with values of @xmath8 for collisions and @xmath34 for uv excitation . from the values in table 2 for the jet",
    "we obtain a ratio of @xmath35 , i.e. consistent with collisional excitation .",
    "we mentioned before , however , that it is possible that some important fraction of the h@xmath2 emission arises from turbulent mixing layers .",
    "if this is the case then the traditional h@xmath2 diagnostic line ratios could be misleading although the emission in a turbulent mixing layer comes from collisionally ionized gas , detailed models of the emitted spectrum due to this process remain to be done ( see e.g. taylor & raga 1995 ) .",
    "the spectral resolution of the ir spectra is low , nevertheless it is clear that lines are shifted with respect to their rest wavelengths .",
    "the direction of the line offsets is consistent with the north jet component being red - shifted , while the south jet component is blue - shifted .",
    "the highest signal - to - noise line is the v = 1@xmath140 s(1 ) transition at 2.121  which gives radial velocities of @xmath36 and @xmath37  for the northern and southern components respectively .",
    "if the warm molecular hydrogen gas has a flow velocity similar to the range of the velocities measured in optical jets , @xmath38 , then the radial velocities suggest an angle of @xmath39 , between the jet and the line of sight .",
    "the detectable h@xmath2 emission of of both jet components extends for at least 40  or @xmath8 pc ( at the distance of orion for a 45  angle ) .",
    "if the flow velocity of the molecular gas is comparable to that of the radial velocities , @xmath40 , then the dynamical age of the system is quite short , @xmath9 yrs .",
    "this age is consistent with the idea of a young jet arising from an embedded source , as it seems to be the case in hh 211 ( mccaughrean et al .",
    "1994 )    is the molecular hydrogen emission consistent with a turbulent mixing layer ?",
    "it is possible to approximately determine the h@xmath2 luminosity emitted by the blue - shifted jet .",
    "a crude estimate of the extinction can be derived from 1 - 0 q(2 ) to 1 - 0 s(0 ) line ratio ( scoville et al .",
    "1982 ) , for which we obtained ( for @xmath41 , see e.g. mathis 1990 ) @xmath42 . the corrected flux for the 1@xmath140 s(1 )",
    "2.12  line ( for @xmath43 of extinction ) is @xmath44 erg s@xmath45 @xmath46 for a distance of 440pc to orion this translates into a luminosity @xmath47 erg @xmath45 . if the h@xmath2 1@xmath140 s(1 ) line carries 1/6 of the total h@xmath2 luminosity ( brand et al .",
    "1988 ) , then @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "the s(1 ) 2.12  flux was extracted from a section of 7.2 , so the luminosity per unit length is @xmath50  pc@xmath45 .",
    "the total luminosity per unit length from a turbulent mixing layer based on a two - dimensional model ( cant & raga 1991 ; noriega - crespo et al .",
    "1996 , eqn(1 ) ) for a jet with a temperature @xmath51 k , a radius @xmath52 cm and a velocity @xmath53 , is given by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the total gas jet density .",
    "so the jet needs a density @xmath56  to be consistent with the value obtained from the spectroscopic measurements . the irs2 jet h@xmath2 emission , like that of hh 110 ,",
    "can be accounted for by a turbulent mixing layer .",
    "the large radial velocities of the warm h@xmath2 gas in the irs2 jet are unusual , and they remind us of the apparent problem of the large tangential motions and shock diagnostics associated with the optical hh objects and jets . for several years it was difficult to reconcile the large tangential velocities observed in hh 1f , @xmath57  ( herbig & jones 1981 ; raga , mateo & barnes 1990 ; eislffel , mundt & bhm 1994 ) and the exitation spectra which were indicating shock velocities of @xmath58  ( see e.  g.raga , bhm & cant 1996 ) .",
    "the hh 46/47 systems is a another example ( dopita , schwartz & evans 1982 ) .",
    "this discrepancy between tangential motions and the excitation of the optical spectra has been interpreted in terms of a jet from a variable velocity source , in which relatively weak ( but fast moving ) working surfaces can be generated in the interaction region between material ejected at different velocities ( raga et al .",
    "1990b ) .",
    "the case for h@xmath2 is probably similar , i.  e. if the radial velocities are indeed @xmath59 , then direct shocks are not accelerating the warm molecular gas .",
    "one can imagine , however , that the gas is already moving at hundreds of kilometerper second ( we do nt know yet how this takes place either in optical or molecular jets ) , and internal weaker shocks or entrainment generates the h@xmath2 emission .",
    "the appealing characteristic of entrainment is that the h@xmath2 excited layer takes a similar shape as that of the optical ( ionic / atomic gas ) jet .",
    "numerical simulations of h@xmath2 jets agree with this idea , and show that is possible to create jets where the warm molecular gas is moving at large velocities without being dissociated ( suttner et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "recently , and motivated by the large radial velocities in irs2 , we measured the proper motion of three condensations of hh 1 in the h@xmath2 2.121  line ( noriega - crespo et al .",
    "we found that hh 1f in h@xmath2 has a tangential velocity comparable to that of the ionic / atomic gas , i.  e. @xmath57  . and finally , in a slightly different context , velocities of @xmath60  in the warm h@xmath2 have been measured in omc-1 , where the 2.121  line profiles are unusually broad ( see e.  g.  nadeau & geballe 1979 ; nadeau , geballe & neugebauer 1982 ; brand et al .",
    "our near - infrared imaging around iras 05487 + 0255 revealed two new highly collimated outflows visible in molecular hydrogen emission but not seen at optical wavelengths .",
    "a single - sided jet is found to emanate from the bright k - band stellar source irs1 .",
    "in contrast , irs2 k - band source appears as a diffuse nebula dominated by scattered continuum light from a highly obscured yso .",
    "the yso drives a narrow bipolar jet seen in molecular hydrogen emission extending more than 0.1pc from its source .",
    "the wavelengths of the h@xmath2 lines indicate relative jet velocities of @xmath61  and imply that the jet axis is at an angle of @xmath39  to the line - of - sight .",
    "the highly collimated morphology of the h@xmath2 jet , the relatively large radial velocities , the fluxes and excitation seem to be consistent with the properties that are expected from a turbulent mixing layer driven by a supersonic atomic jet ( cant & raga 1991 ; taylor & raga 1995 ) .",
    "astrometry shows that the irs1 and irs2 jets are not related to the bright far - infrared source iras 05487 + 0255",
    ". there is , however , a positional coincidence between the iras source and a faint k - band object situated between the hh110 jet and irs1/2 .",
    "but , higher resolution imaging in the far - ir is needed to demonstrate a physical connection .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for a careful reading of the manuscript and very useful comments .",
