    "one of the fundamental subjects in hypernuclear study is to understand the properties of hyperon - nucleus interactions .",
    "thus it has been discussed that a study of a negatively charged @xmath0 hyperon in nuclear medium would provide valuable information concerning the maximal mass of neutron stars , in which a baryon fraction is found to depend on properties of hypernuclear potentials for neutron stars in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the systematic study of the @xmath3-nucleus ( optical ) potential based on the @xmath0 atomic x - ray data was performed by batty and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "the latest analyses of the @xmath0 atomic x - ray have suggested that the @xmath3-nucleus potential has a repulsion inside the nuclear surface and a shallow attraction outside the nucleus with a sizable absorption @xcite .",

    "their analyses of the @xmath0 quasi - free ( qf ) spectra with a distorted - wave impulse approximation found that the @xmath3-nucleus potentials have a strong repulsion in the real part and a sizable absorption in the imaginary part within a woods - saxon ( ws ) form : @xmath7 , \\label{eqn : e1}\\ ] ] where ( @xmath8 , @xmath9)=(@xmath10 mev , @xmath11 mev ) with @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 0.67 fm @xcite .    in previous papers @xcite ,",
    "we have succeeded to explain simultaneously the data of the @xmath0 atoms and the ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) reactions on @xmath1si and @xmath2bi , using the @xmath3-nucleus potentials that have a repulsion inside the nuclear surface and an attraction outside the nucleus with a sizable absorption .",
    "this repulsion originates from the @xmath15 @xmath16 3/2 , @xmath17 channel @xcite , whose state corresponds to a quark pauli - forbidden state in the baryon - baryon system @xcite , and it is a candidate for the appearance of quark degrees of freedom in nuclear physics .",
    "theoretical analyses of the ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) reaction @xcite distinguish partially among properties of the @xmath3-nucleus potential that can reproduce the @xmath0 atomic x - ray data sufficiently , whereas the radial distribution of the @xmath3-nucleus potential inside the nucleus and its strength at the center are hardly determined by fits to the @xmath0 qf spectrum . moreover , we have recognized that an energy dependence of @xmath18 in elementary @xmath19 processes in nuclei is needed to explain the behavior of the ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) spectrum @xcite .",
    "even if using near - recoilless ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) reactions , the radial distribution of the @xmath3-nucleus potential can not clearly be determined for a suitable nuclear target such as @xmath22ni @xcite .",
    "recently , miwa and his collaborators  @xcite have proposed an experiment to measure scattering cross sections with high statistics in @xmath23 elastic and @xmath24 inelastic scatterings by 500-mev / c @xmath25 beam at j - parc .",
    "the purpose of this experiment is to test baryon - baryon interactions based on the flavor su(3 ) symmetry and to directly confirm the existence of the quark pauli - forbidden state in baryon - baryon systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically investigate the elastic scattering of @xmath0 hyperons from nuclei in order to clarify the radial distribution of the @xmath3-nucleus ( optical ) potential .",
    "we calculate the angular distributions of the differential cross sections in the elastic scattering of @xmath0 hyperons from @xmath1si and @xmath2pb at @xmath26 50 mev , and demonstrate the sensitivity of the angular distribution to the radial distribution of several potentials that have explained the @xmath0 atomic x - ray data and the ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) spectra .",
    "it is well - known that optical potential models can describe the elastic scattering of protons or light ions from nuclei , employing appropriate potential parameters phenomenologically .",
    "the angular distribution provides specific tests of the validity of the optical potential , in comparison with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "this is a standard and promising approach for examining the radial distribution of the optical potential in nuclear physics , whereas some ambiguities may still be remained with their strong absorption .",
    "therefore , we believe to examine the radial distribution of the @xmath3-nucleus potentials with the elastic scattering of @xmath0 hyperons from nuclei .",
    "several theoretical attempts have been performed to construct a @xmath3-nucleus potential , fitting systematically to strong - interaction shifts and widths of @xmath0 atomic x - ray data @xcite and manifesting inclusive @xmath5 spectra in the ( @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 ) reaction on nuclear targets @xcite .",
    "the recent status of understanding of the @xmath3-nucleus potential has been reviewed in ref .",

    "we briefly mention the @xmath3-nucleus potentials for @xmath1si and @xmath2pb that we used in this article .",
    "the detailed discussion on properties of the potentials are shown in refs.@xcite .    in previous papers @xcite ,",
    "we have presented several types of the @xmath3-nucleus potential obtained by fitting to strong - interaction shifts and widths of @xmath0 atomic x - ray for various nuclei .",
    "the @xmath3-nucleus potentials that we used are ( a ) the density - dependent ( dd ) potential @xcite , ( b ) the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) potential @xcite , ( c ) the local - density approximation potential ( lda - nf ) based on yng - nf interaction @xcite , ( d ) the lda potential ( lda - s3 ) based on phenomenological two - body @xmath15 sap-3 interaction @xcite , ( e ) the shallow potential in the ws form ( ws - sh ) @xcite , and ( f ) the @xmath27-type potential ( @xmath27 ) @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we display the real and imaginary parts of several @xmath3-nucleus potentials for @xmath1si , of which all reproduce the experimental shifts and widths of the @xmath0 atomic @xmath28 and @xmath29 states sufficiently @xcite .",

    "it was shown that the former potentials ( a - c ) were favored by the analysis of the ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) reaction , rather than the latter ones ( d - f ) , as discussed in ref .",
    "however , the radial distribution of the potential inside the nucleus and its strength at the center were hardly determined by fits to the ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) spectrum @xcite .",
    " * fig . 1 * ",
    "+    it is important to investigate the @xmath3-nucleus potential for neutron - excess nuclei like @xmath32 , because one expects to obtain valuable information on the isovector component @xmath33 in the potential , while the @xmath3-nucleus potential for @xmath1si gives us information on the isoscalar component @xmath34 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we display the real and imaginary parts of several @xmath3-nucleus potentials for @xmath2pb , which is determined by fits to the @xmath0 atomic x - ray data .",
    "the potentials for dd - a@xmath35 , dd - obe and lda - nf have a strong repulsion inside the nuclear surface and an attraction outside the nucleus with a sizable absorption @xcite , and the potentials for lda - s3 and @xmath31 have an attraction at the nuclear center . in a previous paper @xcite , we have shown that the former potentials fully reproduce the spectrum of the @xmath36bi(@xmath4,@xmath5 ) reaction , rather than the latter ones .",
    "thus we have concluded that they provide the ability to explain the data of the ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) reactions as well as those of the @xmath0 atoms ; but it was impossible to discriminate among the radial distributions of the potentials for dd - a@xmath35 , dd - obe and lda - nf inside the nucleus , and it was difficult to clearly see the contributions of the isoscalar and isovector components in this analysis @xcite .     * fig . 2 * ",
    "we calculate the differential cross sections by solving the radial part of the non - relativistic schrdinger equation as a scattering problem : @xmath37 r_{l}(r ) = e r_{l}(r ) , \\label{eqn : e2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is a radial wave function with angular momentum @xmath39 ; @xmath40 is the @xmath3-nucleus potential , @xmath41 is the coulomb potential with a uniform distribution of charge for @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the @xmath0 nucleus reduced mass , and @xmath44 is the incident energy of the center - of - mass frame . it is noted that the potentials of @xmath40 seem to include effects of a nuclear spin - orbit potential because they can reproduce the data of the @xmath0 atomic ( @xmath45 ) states and ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) reactions .",
    "however , as far as the elastic scattering of @xmath0 hyperons at the low - energy like @xmath26 50 mev is concerned , the effects of the spin - orbit potential on the differential cross section are negligible , as we will discuss later .    the angular distribution of the differential cross section in the elastic scattering is written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the elastic scattering amplitude , which is often decomposed into traveling - waves decomposition of the nearside ( n ) and farside ( f ) components , @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "they denote the sum of the coulomb and nuclear parts as @xmath50 with @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the coulomb phase shift and the s - matrix element in the elastic scattering , respectively",
    ". the traveling - wave function @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) corresponds to the nearside ( farside ) component , and it is defined in terms of the legendre functions @xcite : @xmath56 .",
    "\\label{eqn : e6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the semi - classical limit , they can be associated with trajectories that pass the near side and the far side of the scattering center .",
    "therefore , this decomposition gives a good understanding of the behavior of the angular distribution depending on the nuclear potential that has an attraction and/or a repulsion with a strong absorption @xcite .",
    "the angular distributions for the nearside and farside contributions denote @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "because the @xmath3-nucleus potential has a sizable absorption , the angular distribution of @xmath0 hyperons from nuclei may behave similar to that of light composite nuclei rather than that of protons .",
    "let us consider the elastic scattering of @xmath0 hyperons from @xmath1si @xcite .",
    "we calculate the angular distribution of the differential cross section in this elastic scattering , using several types of the @xmath3-nucleus potential ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . here",
    "we assume the @xmath0 incident energy of @xmath26 50 mev in the laboratory frame .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , we show the calculated angular distributions of the cross section @xmath59 from @xmath1si , together with the nearside @xmath60 and farside @xmath61 components .",
    "it is clearly seen that the angular distributions for dd , rmf and lda - nf differ from those for lda - s3 , ws - sh and @xmath27 .",
    "this implies that the potentials of the former are fully distinguishable from those of the latter , and it supports our previous results on the analysis of the ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) reaction @xcite .    in the angular distributions for dd , rmf and lda - nf ,",
    "the diffraction oscillations arise from the fraunhofer interference between the nearside @xmath62 and farside @xmath63 amplitudes , and reach their maximum amplitude at @xmath64 , where the angle @xmath65 for @xmath66 is called a `` fraunhofer crossover '' and hence @xmath67 40@xmath68@xmath6950@xmath68 in the cases of these potentials .",
    "forward of the crossover , the farside is dominant , while for angles somewhat larger than @xmath65 , the nearside dominates .",
    "this oscillations is damped with increasing @xmath70 because of the falloff of the farside components @xmath61 .",
    "the dominance of @xmath61 at small angles is caused by the coulomb attraction for @xmath0 hyperons that have a negative charge , and by the attraction pocket of the @xmath3-nucleus potentials at the nuclear surface ; the dominance of @xmath60 at large angles is due to the strong repulsive components in the potentials for dd , rmf and lda - nf .",
    "it is very interesting because this situation is completely opposite to that of the normal nucleus - nucleus scattering where @xmath60 dominates at small angles owing to the coulomb repulsion , and @xmath61 becomes dominant with increasing @xmath70 owing to the strong attraction in nucleus - nucleus potentials @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the angular distribution in the nucleus - nucleus elastic scattering has been studied in the case of the repulsive nucleus - nucleus potential at high incident energies of @xmath71 300 mev @xcite .    in the cases of the potential for @xmath27 ,",
    "ws - sh and lda - s3 , the slope and oscillation pattern of their angular distributions differ appreciably . for @xmath27 , we find that @xmath61 is dominant over all angles because the @xmath3-nucleus potential is attractive , in addition to the coulomb attraction . for lda - s3 , the oscillations are clearly observed owing to the fraunhofer crossover between @xmath61 and @xmath60 at @xmath72 90@xmath68 and the magnitude of @xmath60 is something large at @xmath73 90@xmath68 because the real part of the potential is repulsive at @xmath74 1.8@xmath692.6 fm , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the situation for ws - sh seems to be on the way from lda - s3 to @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , we show that the angular distribution of the @xmath0 elastic - scattering differential cross section from @xmath1si provides a classification for properties of the @xmath3-nucleus potentials .     * fig . 3 *  +    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , we compare the cross sections for dd , rmf and lda - nf in order to evaluate the detailed discrimination of properties of the potential inside the nucleus .",
    "we notice that the magnitudes of their angular distributions ( @xmath59 ) differ appreciably at angles @xmath75 , where the magnitude and shape of @xmath59 are affected by the radial distribution of the potential inside the nuclear surface .",
    "indeed , a notch test suggests that the magnitude and shape of @xmath59 at angles @xmath76 are sensitive to the radial distribution of the potential at @xmath74 2.6 fm , which corresponds to the region of the inner repulsion of the potential , depending on the strength of the imaginary parts .",
    " * fig .",
    "4 *  +    for dd , rmf or lda - nf , moreover , the attractive pocket of the potential at the nuclear surface with the coulomb attraction plays an important role in making a diffraction structure of the angular distribution , so that it leads the nearside component to be large , and causes a strong oscillation of the angular distribution . to clarify this effect , we study behavior of the angular distribution @xmath59 using the ws potential that has only the repulsion in the real part and a sizable absorption in the imaginary part , for example , ws30 defined as ( @xmath8 , @xmath9)=(@xmath77 mev , @xmath11 mev ) in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : e1 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , we show the calculated angular distribution for ws30 , as compared with that for rmf .",
    "we find that the magnitude of @xmath61 for ws30 falls off rapidly on its steep slope with increasing @xmath70 from the forward angle .",
    "thus this diffraction oscillations are shifted toward the forward angle and their magnitude becomes small .",
    "this is caused by the lack of the attraction at the nuclear surface in the repulsive ws30 potential .",
    "consequently , it is shown that the angular distribution for the elastic scattering of 50-mev @xmath0 hyperons from @xmath1si gives additional information to discriminate among the radial distributions of the potentials inside the nucleus , e.g. , inner repulsion and attractive pocket , which were not able to be identified by the analysis of the @xmath0 atomic x - ray and ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) reaction .",
    "it implies that the elastic scattering of @xmath0 hyperons from nuclei is a powerful tool for identifying the radial distribution of the potential by the use of the diffraction pattern influenced by the nuclear repulsion and the coulomb attraction , rather than @xmath78 hyperons acting on the nuclear repulsion with the coulomb repulsion .     * fig . 5 * ",
    "+    we consider the elastic scattering of @xmath0 hyperons from @xmath2pb , which has a large attraction of the coulomb interaction .",
    "we calculate the angular distribution of the differential cross section ( @xmath59 ) at @xmath26 50 mev , using several types of the @xmath3-nucleus potential ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , we show the calculated angular distributions of @xmath59 , together with the nearside @xmath60 and farside @xmath61 components , respectively .    in the cases of dd - a@xmath35 , dd - obe and lda - nf , we find the similar behavior of their results in the angular distribution , where a difference between the @xmath3-nucleus potentials for @xmath2pb is not so enhanced , in comparison with that for @xmath1si .",
    "this recalls the fact that the effect on the @xmath3-nucleus potential is rather masked by the strong coulomb potential in @xmath2pb , as discussed in ref .",
    "however , we recognize that the diffraction pattern in @xmath2pb differs from that in @xmath1si as follows : as increasing @xmath70 the former @xmath61 falls off on a steep slope more rapidly than the latter @xmath61 , and hence the former @xmath60 dominates at @xmath73 30@xmath68 .",
    "thus the fraunhofer crossover is slightly shifted toward the forward angle . moreover ,",
    "a lot of fraunhofer oscillations in @xmath2pb appear , which may correspond to the grazing angular momentum @xmath79 13 ( @xmath79 6 in @xmath1si ) for lda - nf if @xmath80 is defined as a value at the transmission @xmath81 1/2 @xcite .",
    "the oscillation spacing between maxima @xmath82 is also reduced in @xmath2pb .    in the case of @xmath27 , we find that @xmath61 is dominant in all angles and @xmath60 is negligible , so that the oscillations in @xmath59 are indistinctive .",
    "this originates from the fact that both the @xmath3-nucleus potential and the coulomb potential are strongly attractive . for lda - s3",
    ", we also find that @xmath61 is dominant as well as that of @xmath27 , but @xmath60 is not negligible because the potential for lda - s3 has a weaker attraction than that for @xmath27 .",
    "the oscillations in @xmath59 are clearly shown at angles @xmath83 120@xmath68 by the appearance of the crossover .     * fig .",
    "6 *  +    in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , we show the angular distributions of the cross sections for dd - a@xmath35 , dd - obe and lda - nf in order to evaluate the repulsive components and radial distributions of their potentials inside the nucleus .",
    "we compare the results on dd - a@xmath35 with those on dd - obe , because the former has the inner repulsion of @xmath8480 mev at the nuclear center and the latter has that of @xmath8430 mev in the similar potential form , depending on the imaginary part of individual potentials .",
    "thus we realize that the magnitudes of their @xmath59 are sufficiently discriminable at @xmath73 60@xmath68 .",
    "moreover , let us compare the results on lda - nf with those on dd - obe , because the radial distributions of their potentials differ markedly whereas the inner repulsions at the nuclear center are almost the same .",
    "thus we can see that the oscillation patterns of their @xmath59 are slightly different .",
    "consequently , we recognize that the angular distribution of the @xmath0 elastic - scattering differential cross section from @xmath2pb provides the ability to discriminate among the radial distributions of the potentials inside the nucleus .     * fig . 7 *",
    " +    as mentioned in sect.[sect : calculation ] , the potentials of @xmath40 seem to include the effects of the nuclear spin - orbit potential because they can reproduce the data of the @xmath0 atomic ( @xmath45 ) states and ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) reactions , though our calculations do not deal with the spin - orbit term explicitly . however , it is one of the important subjects to study the spin - orbit potential for a @xmath3 hyperon @xcite , whereas the experimental information is extremely limited .",
    "according to several theoretical predictions @xcite , here , we consider the spin - orbit potential for @xmath3 with the strength of @xmath85 @xmath86 , where @xmath87 for a nucleon .",
    "when we use the potential for rmf including artificially a spin - orbit term of @xmath88{\\bm \\sigma}{\\cdot}{\\bm l}$ ] which is often used , we show that the calculated angular distributions are almost the same as those for the original rmf in the elastic scattering of 50-mev @xmath0 hyperons from @xmath1si , e.g. , @xmath89 at the first maximum for @xmath72 50@xmath68 is increased by only about 6% .",
    "this small difference originates from the fact that the @xmath0 elastic scattering at @xmath26 50 mev is regarded as a low - energy one , in comparison with high - energy scatterings of @xmath90 100@xmath69300 mev , where the spin - orbit effects could fairly act because the contribution of large @xmath39 s to the differential cross section is important . for @xmath2pb",
    "the situation is the same as that for @xmath1si .",
    "we have theoretically investigated the elastic scattering of 50-mev @xmath0 hyperons from @xmath1si and @xmath2pb in order to clarify the radial distribution of the @xmath3-nucleus potentials .",
    "the angular distributions of their differential cross sections have been calculated using several potentials that can explain the experimental data of the @xmath0 atomic x - ray and ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) spectra simultaneously .",
    "we have discussed the behavior of the magnitude and oscillation pattern in the angular distribution by the use of the nearside / farside decomposition of the elastic scattering amplitude , and we have examined a competition between the attraction of the coulomb interaction and the repulsion / attraction in the @xmath3-nucleus potentials . as far as the low - energy elastic scattering like @xmath26",
    "50 mev is concerned , the effects of the spin - orbit potential on the angular distribution are very small .    in conclusion ,",
    "the angular distribution of the differential cross sections in the 50-mev @xmath0 elastic scattering from @xmath1si and @xmath2pb provides additional information to discriminate the nature of the repulsion / attraction inside the nuclear surface in the @xmath3-nucleus potentials where it was not uniquely determined by the @xmath0 atomic x - ray data and the ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) spectra .",
    "we expect that the elastic scattering experiments of @xmath0 hyperons from nuclear targets are curried out at j - parc facilities in the future , in spite of some experimental difficulties .",
