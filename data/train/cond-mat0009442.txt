    "although the electronic eigenstates and eigenvalues are essentially given by the fock - darwin states @xcite , detailed experimental data @xcite reveal the importance of correlation effects on the ground state properties of the electrons in quantum dots . in order to take these correlation effects into account , various approximate theoretical methods @xcite have been used .",
    "e.g. , the eigenstates and eigenvalues of an harmonic interaction model including the effects of a magnetic field have been studied with operator techniques @xcite , and the harmonic interaction model has been used to explain specific features in the addition spectrum  of a quantum dot in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the harmonic interaction model is one of the rare examples for which the thermodynamical properties are exactly soluble , including the boson or fermion statistics , in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it can also function as a trial model for the variational treatment of systems with more realistic interactions with the aid of the jensen - feynman inequality @xcite .",
    "an example of this approach can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the jensen - feynman variational approach is used to describe the bose - einstein condensation  in a gas of @xmath0rb and in a gas of @xmath1li atoms .",
    "the spin statistics of the harmonic interaction model @xcite can be treated within the same many - body path integral formalism .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the density of harmonically interacting electrons in a parabolic quantum dot in a magnetic field , taking into account the electron correlation effects analytically .",
    "this analysis is a natural extension of our previous investigation of the thermodynamical properties of a confined system of spin - polarized fermions in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite , using a method that combines the path - integral formalism @xcite , the method of symmetrized density matrices @xcite , and inversion techniques for generating functions @xcite . instead of using the stochastic approach @xcite with the it condition on the magnetic field @xcite for calculating the path integral for @xmath2 identical interacting oscillators in a magnetic field , we relied on a detailed investigation of the classical equations of motion .",
    "the quantum mechanical corrections to their classical action are exactly taken into account .",
    "the model system of @xmath2 harmonically interacting oscillators in a magnetic field is described by the lagrangian ( units with @xmath3 and @xmath4 equal to unity are used throughout this paper ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the cyclotron frequency , and where the potential energy @xmath7 results from a harmonic confinement potential and a harmonic two - body interaction @xmath8 the two - body potential might be either attractive or repulsive depending on the plus sign or the minus sign in the two - body interaction .",
    "as a first step in the calculation of the path integral , we studied the case of _ distinguishable _ particles @xcite .",
    "because the magnetic field only affects the equations of motion in the @xmath9 plane perpendicular to the magnetic field , the lagrangian naturally decouples into two contributions @xmath10 where @xmath11 contains the magnetic field .",
    "this allows to calculate the propagator in the @xmath9-plane independently from the propagator in the @xmath12-direction . through a transformation to the center of mass reference frame ,",
    "one obtains a set of @xmath2 three - dimensional oscillators in a magnetic field .",
    "the center of mass is described by an oscillator with frequency @xmath13 the remaining @xmath14 oscillators , associated with the internal degrees of freedom , have a frequency @xmath15 note that the case of a repulsive interaction imposes a stability constraint on the confinement potential : @xmath16 has to be large enough to keep the repelling particles together .",
    "the magnetic field does not affect these frequencies in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "but in the @xmath9 plane the equations of motion reveal two renormalized frequencies due to the magnetic field @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the larmor frequency .",
    "the index @xmath19 refers to the renormalized frequency in the center of mass coordinates .",
