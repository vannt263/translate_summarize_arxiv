    "the spin hall effect ( she ) and its inverse ( ishe ) are key ingredients for spintronic devices since they enable conversion of charge currents to and from spin currents without using ferromagnets and external magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "one of the typical examples of utilizing the ishe is a detection of a spin dependent chemical potential arising from the spin seebeck effect  @xcite .",
    "the spin seebeck effect converts heat into spin current , and the generated spin current can be electrically detected by the ishes of pt  @xcite and au  @xcite .",

    "a pure spin current , flow of only spin angular momentum without charge current , is generated by the she of ta , and induces a spin transfer torque in the ferromagnetic layer .",
    "to realize the detection of the spin seebeck effect as well as the magnetization switching , the ishes and she s of simple metals such as pt  @xcite , au  @xcite , and ta  @xcite have been mainly used . among them , pt has been widely believed to be the best she material exhibiting a large spin hall ( sh ) angle which represents the conversion yield between charge and spin currents .",
    "however it is a costly metal , unsuitable for the practical application .",
    "in addition , the she s of 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 transition metals originate from the intrinsic mechanism based on the degeneracy of @xmath0 orbits by spin - orbit ( so ) coupling  @xcite .",
    "this fact indicates that it is difficult to modulate the sh angle artificially once the transition metal is fixed .",
    "there is another type of she , the extrinsic she induced by scattering on impurities with strong so interaction .",
    "there are two mechanisms in the extrinsic she , i.e. , the skew scattering  @xcite and the side jump  @xcite . unlike the case of the intrinsic she , the sh angle can be enhanced by changing the combination of host and impurity metals . according to recent theoretical calculations based on the skew scattering  @xcite",
    ", some combinations of noble metals and impurities can give rise to very large sh angles , for example in cu or ag doped with bi .",
    "we have experimentally demonstrated the extrinsic she s induced by ir  @xcite and bi  @xcite impurities in cu . as for ir - doped cu , the magnetization switching has already been realized using the she of cuir alloys  @xcite . since cu is a typical inexpensive metal , cu - based alloys are desirable for future application of spintronic devices . in this paper",

    "we focus on the spin absorption method as shown in fig .",
    "one of the advantages of this method is that not only the sh angle but also the spin diffusion length , which is a crucial quantity to determine the sh angle , can be determined on the same device .",
    "in addition , the spin absorption method is valid for large so ( or short spin diffusion length ) materials which in general have large sh angles . to obtain the sh angle and the spin diffusion length , we use two different models : ( i ) the one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin diffusion model developed by takahashi and maekawa  @xcite , and ( ii ) the three - dimensional ( 3d ) spin diffusion model based on an extension of the valet - fert formalism  @xcite .",

    "it is slightly smaller than that in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "this might be related to a slightly smaller spin diffusion length of a 100  nm thick ag wire compared to cu  @xcite , although we did not check the @xmath18 dependence of the nlsv signal without any middle wire .",
    "the sign of @xmath63 is also negative for @xmath122 .",
    "note that @xmath6 is defined as @xmath122 .",
    "we then changed the magnetic field angle to confirm if the observed signal for the ag bridge really comes from the ishe of the cu@xmath86bi@xmath87 wire .",
    "the signal disappears when @xmath123 [ see fig  [ fig8](b ) ] and the sign reverses when @xmath124 .",
    "these results clearly show that @xmath63 does not depend on the bridge material which is used to transfer the pure spin current to the middle wire .",
    "next we keep the cu bridge and change the host metal from cu to ag since bi - doped ag is also predicted to have a large she  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig9](a ) , we show @xmath63 of ag@xmath117bi@xmath118 and pure ag measured at @xmath23  k. apparently , when there is no bi impurity in ag , no ishe is observed , which means that @xmath63 is negligibly small in pure ag .",
    "this result is consistent with a recent spin pumping measurement with ag / py bilayer films  @xcite .",
    "once a small amount of bi impurities is added in ag , a negative ishe is observed as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9](a ) .",
    "contrary to the theoretical predictions  @xcite , however , the observed ishe of ag@xmath117bi@xmath118 was not so large as that of cu@xmath86bi@xmath87 [ see fig .",

    "[ fig9](b ) , @xmath119 linearly increases with increasing the bi concentration up to 3% , which clearly shows that the skew scattering is the dominant mechanism for the she  @xcite .",
    "this result also indicates that there is no segregation of bi in ag up to 3% , while bi impurities start to segregate from 0.5% in cu as already discussed in ref .  .",
    "using the 1d and 3d models , @xmath125 and @xmath100 can be estimated as @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively . compared to cubi alloys ,",
    "the sh angle is one order smaller and comparable to that of cuir alloys  @xcite .",
    "so far , we have fixed the temperature at @xmath128  k where the phonon contribution can be neglected .",
    "to see the temperature dependence of the sh angle is one of the best ways to discuss the dominant mechanism of the she  @xcite . for this purpose , we measured @xmath63 and @xmath92 every 10  k , and estimated @xmath113 and @xmath100 .",

    "ag@xmath117bi@xmath118 has an almost temperature independent sh angle , which is characteristic of the skew scattering  @xcite , and the difference between @xmath111 and @xmath110 is relatively small .",
    "cu@xmath86bi@xmath87 has almost the same tendency as ag@xmath117bi@xmath118 although there is a slight enhancement of the sh angle below 30  k. as for au , on the other hand , the temperature dependence of the sh angle is quite different from those of the other two alloys .",
    "both @xmath113 and @xmath100 decrease with increasing temperature and the difference between the two is getting smaller .",
    "the temperature dependence of the she of noble metal has been discussed in pt  @xcite as well as in au  @xcite . in ref .",
    ", it was found that the sh conductivity of pt is independent of temperature , which means that the sh angle increases with increasing temperature .",
    "the same tendency has been confirmed in the inverse sh voltage for a pt / py bilayer film  @xcite . on the other hand , in the case of au , the temperature dependence is opposite to the case of pt  @xcite , which is consistent with the present result . in refs .   and , such a temperature dependence was attributed to the two extrinsic contributions , namely skew scattering and side jump . however , as already shown in a few theoretical  @xcite and experimental papers  @xcite , the linearly increasing or decreasing sh angle with temperature is typical of the intrinsic mechanism based on the degeneracy of @xmath0 orbits by so coupling . in the present case , the intrinsic mechanism is predominant since the sh angle decreases almost linearly with increasing temperature , which is qualitatively different from ref .",
    "where the sh angle of au is independent of temperature , characteristic of the skew scattering .",
    "we now come back to the cu host and change the impurity .",
    "what happens when another 6@xmath129 impurity is doped in cu ?",
    "we fabricated sh devices using cu@xmath86pb@xmath87 and measured the ishe and nlsv at @xmath23  k. in fig .",
    "[ fig12](a ) , we show @xmath63 of cu@xmath86pb@xmath87 .",
    "note that all cu@xmath86pb@xmath87 samples were prepared within five hours after the deposition of cupb middle wires .",
    "when we measure the cu@xmath86pb@xmath87 samples right after the deposition of the cu bridge , it has two times smaller @xmath121 than cu@xmath86bi@xmath87 , while the spin diffusion length of cu@xmath86pb@xmath87 is comparable or even larger than that of cu@xmath86bi@xmath87 [ see table  [ table1 ] ] . from the ishe and nlsv measurements , @xmath100 of cu@xmath86pb@xmath87 is estimated to be @xmath130 , which is half of @xmath100 of cu@xmath86bi@xmath87 .",
    "what is interesting to note is the aging effect of @xmath63 of cu@xmath86pb@xmath87 .",
    "after the measurements at @xmath23  k , the samples were warmed up to room temperature and kept in a vacuum box for 1 day .",
    "then we measured the same samples again at @xmath23  k. as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig12](a ) , @xmath63 of cu@xmath86pb@xmath87 decreases by more than half .",
    "we simply repeated this procedure until we could not obtain @xmath63 . in a few days , @xmath63 of cu@xmath86pb@xmath87 disappeared . on the other hand , cu@xmath86bi@xmath87 did not show such an aging effect at least in one week . in fig .",
    "[ fig12](b ) , we plot @xmath121 of cu@xmath86pb@xmath87 as a function of time after the deposition of the cupb wire . for six samples from three different batches",
    ", @xmath121 disappears within a few days .",
    "the above result indicates that pb impurities in the middle wire move somewhere .",
    "in fact , it is known that pb has a very fast mobility . according to a scanning tunneling microscopy study on cu islands on pb(111 ) substrate  @xcite , cu islands are masked by pb atoms from the substrate .",
    "this migration originates from a very fast mobility of pb in cu .",
    "we have taken a scanning tunneling electron microscopy ( stem ) image of the cu@xmath86pb@xmath87 and cu junction and performed energy dispersive x - ray ( edx ) analyses several days after the deposition of cupb wire . in our procedure , we can not take the stem image right after the cupb deposition , but as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12](c ) , pb atoms are segregated at the bottom of the middle wire several days after the fabrication . presumably , such segregated pb impurities at the substrate would not contribute to the ishe , and thus @xmath63 of cu@xmath86pb@xmath87 becomes almost zero in a few days .    before closing this subsection",
    ", we discuss the reason why 6@xmath129 impurities such as pb and bi in the cu host show large sh angles .",
    "first of all , pb and bi have large so interactions because of their large atomic numbers . according to recent theoretical predictions  @xcite , a large difference of so interactions between the host ( in the present case , cu ) and impurity metals is one of the key points to have a large she based on the skew scattering mechanism . in addition , not only the atomic number but also the orbit of outermost shell play an important role in the strength of so interaction  @xcite . intuitively thinking , when the orbital angular momentum is large , the so interaction is also large .",
    "however , to obtain the expectation value of so interaction , one needs to multiply the wave functions .",
    "when the orbital angular momentum is large ( @xmath0 or @xmath131 orbits ) , the wave function is rather closed and does not have a chance to hybridize with the most outer orbit . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath129 orbits have spread wave functions and thus have larger so interactions  @xcite . therefore , 6@xmath129 impurities such as pb and bi have the largest so interactions . for cubi ,",
    "a calculation based on a phase shift model predicts a negative sh angle but smaller ( @xmath132 ) than the experimental one . a similar calculation has not been performed for agbi and cupb .",
    "finally , let us mention the spin diffusion length and the sh angle of ta .",
    "this topic was the cause of the big debate among several groups  @xcite . in ref .  , some of the present authors reported @xmath93 and @xmath113 of ta using the 1d models , i.e. , eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) , respectively .",
    "however , according to ref .  , the sh angle of ta is @xmath133 , which is about 40 times larger than our @xmath113 of ta .",
    "liu  _ et al_. pointed out in ref .   that the overestimations of the shunting factor @xmath47 and @xmath93 result in a large underestimation of the sh angle of ta .",
    "thus , we have performed the 3d analysis to obtain @xmath94 and @xmath100 of ta . as can be seen in table  [ table1 ]",
    ", @xmath94 is 3  nm , which is the same as @xmath93 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath100 is @xmath134 which is twice larger than @xmath113 .",
    "this difference certainly comes from the overestimation of @xmath47 .",
    "however , the large sh angle reported in ref .",
    "can not be reproduced in our analysis . the big difference in @xmath62 of ta between ref .   and",
    "the present result is not clear yet , but apparently it does not originate from the overestimation of the spin diffusion length of ta .",
    "we believe that in the ferromagnetic / ta bilayer system , some additional effects are induced at the interface between ta and the ferromagnet  @xcite , and thus the sh angle obtained in ref .",
    "is seemingly enhanced by a factor of more than 10 .",
    "we have experimentally studied the extrinsic she s of cubi , agbi , and cupb alloys with the spin absorption technique in the lateral spin valve structure . among them , cubi shows the largest she .",
    "the sh angle estimated with the 3d model amounts to @xmath1 .",
    "such a large she of cubi has been supported by several additional measurements ; ( i ) comparison with the she of au which has a comparable spin diffusion length to cubi , ( ii ) wal measurements to obtain the spin diffusion length , ( iii ) the cubi thickness dependence of the sh angle , ( iv ) ishe measurements with substitution of ag for the cu bridge , and ( v ) the magnetic field angle dependence of the ishes .",
    "cupb also shows a large sh angle ( @xmath130 ) but the sh signal disappears in a few days presumably because of the fast migration of pb in cu . on the other hand , when the cu host is replaced with ag ,",
    "the sh angle is reduced by a factor of ten .",
