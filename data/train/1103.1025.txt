    "@xcite introduced a distance between two bases for a quantification of the notion of `` unbiasedness . ''",
    "the distance vanishes when the two bases are identical and attains its maximal value of unity when they are unbiased .",
    "one can then consider the average squared distance ( asd ) between several bases and search for its maximal value .",

    "this search is the subject matter of the next section .",
    "our numerical approach relies on the mapping between 1-qudit operators and 2-qudit states established in chapter 3 of @xcite . plus",
    "we use the steepest - ascent algorithm to find the maximum asd between four bases in dimension six .",
    "details of the numerical method are presented in appendix  [ app1 ] .",

    "a similar numerical study was recently performed by butterley and hall @xcite who minimized @xmath28 with the so - called levenberg - marquadt algorithm .",
    "our approach confirms the extremal value they found , and we also exhibit the structure of the four bases that maximize @xmath29 for @xmath10 .",
    "we have used our code not only in dimension @xmath10 but also for other @xmath5 values as a mean of benchmarking .",
    "we have run our code 2,500 times for the dimensions two to five , 10,000 times for the dimension six and 300 times for the dimension seven , both for @xmath30 bases and for four bases .",

    "the absolute maximum of @xmath27 is always reached for @xmath31 bases in dimensions @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . as the seven - dimensional case illustrates , the difficulty of finding the global maximum increases rapidly with the dimension because there are many local maxima at which the steepest - ascent search can get stuck .",
    "we have also looked for the largest asd between four bases in dimensions two to seven .",
    "we could not find four mub in dimensions two and six .",

    "they are the cases of four bases in dimension two and six .    at most three mub",
    "can be constructed in dimension two .",
    "thus the maximum asd between four bases has to be less than one .",
    "this example is interesting because it can be analytically solved . in @xmath36 , the four bases correspond to the tetrahedron , where each edge represents a basis .",
    "importantly , we have searched for the maximum asd between four bases in dimension six .",
    "we have found the largest value to be @xmath37 . in the search for the global maximum",
    ", we have also found a few other local maxima whose frequencies of occurrence are reported in figure  [ fig : histo ] . these results are consistent with those reported by butterley and hall  @xcite .",
    "we find the same local and global maxima with very similar frequencies .",
    "this is as expected because we have generated the four random bases from which the search proceeds in the same way as butterley and hall , using the same dedicated matlab command .",
    "the two numerical methods are different , however .",
    "we use the steepest - ascent algorithm while they employ the levenberg - marquadt algorithm for a nonlinear least - squares optimization .     for the other 70% of initial bases . ]",
    "since we consider four bases , there are six pairs of bases and their respective distances are not without interest .",
    "indeed , it turns out that one basis is unbiased with the three remaining bases . and these three remaining bases are themselves equidistant .",
    "the immediate implication is that the privileged basis can be chosen to be the computational basis while the three remaining bases are hadamard bases , that is : the unitary matrices composed of the columns that represent the basis kets with reference to the computational basis are complex hadamard matrices divided by @xmath38 .",
    "we recall here that a complex hadamard matrix is a @xmath5-dimensional square matrix satisfying the two conditions of unimodularity and orthogonality  @xcite @xmath39 therefore , the unitary matrix @xmath40 has matrix elements that can be related to a pair of unbiased bases : @xmath41 .",
    "in addition to maximizing @xmath29 , our code also returns the four bases for which the maximum is achieved . after a bit of polishing ",
    "the set of four bases is not unique , since global unitary transformations yield equivalent sets , and the order of kets in each basis is arbitrary  this allows us to seek for the structure hidden behind the maximum asd . in the next section",
    "we will present a two - parameter family of three bases .",
    "the two parameters are two phases while the three bases are three hadamard bases",
    ". we study in detail the properties of this family and show that , for some definite values of the two parameters , these three bases together with the canonical basis reach the numerically - found maximum asd of @xmath11 .",
    "this definite structure of the optimal four bases is our main result , with a closed expression for @xmath42 as a most - welcome bonus ; see eq .",
    "( [ avdmax ] ) below .    harking back to table  [ tab :",
    "table1 ] , we note that the best set of seven bases in dimension six has an asd of @xmath43 , short of unity by a mere one - and - a - half percent .",
    "for all practical purposes  those of state tomography , say  these seven bases are marginally worse than the imaginary seven mub that no one has managed to find .",
    "following karlsson  @xcite , we express the two - parameter family in terms of @xmath44 block matrices where each of the nine blocks is itself a complex hadamard matrix .",
    "such @xmath44 block matrices are called @xmath45-reducible .",
    "the two - parameter family contains three bases , the fourth basis being the canonical basis .",
    "we will see that these three hadamard bases are equidistant , that their determinants are identical , and that they belong to the so - called fourier transposed family @xmath46 .",
    "finally , we will show that together with the canonical basis they reach the numerically - found maximum of the asd .",
    "we begin by defining a few quantities .",
    "we will need the third root of unity @xmath47 as well as the following @xmath44 matrices : @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are two phases .",
    "let us notice that @xmath52 and @xmath53 are themselves hadamard matrices .",
    "the hadamard matrices for the three bases are given by @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the above parameterization , we have introduced the matrices @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 , which we will address as dephasing and central matrices , respectively .",

    "before we turn to the proofs , we wish to point out that an additional relation between the two phases @xmath59 and @xmath60 exists , @xmath61 it reduces the two - parameter family to a single - parameter family .",
    "of course , as a subfamily , it conserves all the fundamental properties of the two - parameter family .",
    "furthermore it still reaches the maximum asd .",
    "a significant property of the three proposed hadamard matrices is their equidistance .",
    "the relevant terms that appear in the distance between the two bases @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( i.e. , @xmath64 ) are the elements of the product matrix @xmath65 ( i.e. , @xmath66 ) in absolute value . therefore , if the three product matrices @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 have equal coefficients in absolute value , then the three bases @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are equidistant .",
