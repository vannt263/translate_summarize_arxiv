    "the long - running debate on the heating of chromospheric layers by acoustic waves is fed by the fact that even the largest measured energy fluxes ( found by bello gonzlez et al.2009,2010 ) are nearly an order of magnitude smaller than the amount needed to balance the chromospheric energy losses of 14000wm@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "bello gonzlez et al . found an acoustic energy flux of @xmath03000  wm@xmath1 at 250 km and of @xmath02000  wm@xmath1 at 500 km from velocity fluctuations measured from narrow - band ( fwhm=1.8pm ) data at @xmath004 spatial resolution on the fei lines at 557.6 nm and 543.4 nm , formed in mid - photospheric and low - chromospheric layers , respectively .",
    "this is a factor of 46 larger than that given by @xcite and @xcite from intensity fluctuations in continuum bands at 160 nm ( of @xmath01@xmath2 spatial resolution ) and in caiih formed at heights of 430 km and 200 km , respectively .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed introduction to the acoustic - wave heating debate .",
    "+ in this contribution , we present results on acoustic waves from data taken in the fei line at 525.02 nm with the highest spatial resolution considered so far .",

    "the capabilities of retrieving the physical parameters with the given spectral sampling have been studied by @xcite .",
    "the data were calibrated according to @xcite ( sect.9.2 ) and possess a spatial resolution of 015018 , achieved by combining the onboard image stabilization system @xcite and phase - diversity techniques @xcite .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) considered is 44.8@xmath544.8arcsec@xmath6 ( 815@xmath5815pix@xmath6 ) .",
    "the line - of - sight ( los ) velocities were determined by measuring doppler shifts of the _ minimum _ position of a gaussian fitting the 4 spectral points within the fei line plus continuum @xcite .",
    "we base our study of wave phenomena on the analysis of fluctuations in the measured los velocities . for a better comprehension of the atmospheric layer where the fei line at 525.02 nm is sensitive to velocity fluctuations , we calculated velocity response functions ( @xmath7 ) , applying the method described by @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we considered granule ( gr ) and intergranule ( igr ) model atmospheres based on 3d simulations from @xcite .",
    "results are shown in fig.[rfs]a . in the case of a spectrometer with infinite spectral resolution ,",
    "the @xmath7 calculated for the line minimum in both atmospheres are centred around 400 km height , in agreement with results by @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath7 are shifted to lower layers and partly broadened when ( a ) the spectral transmission of the imax instrument and ( b ) the gaussian - fit used in the determination of the line - minimum velocities , are applied to the emergent intensities in order to mimic the measurements from imax observations . for gr ,",
    "the @xmath7 is centred at @xmath0325 km and for igr at @xmath0175 km .",
    "+      the broad extent in height of the @xmath7 indicates the large atmospheric range where the measured velocities are referred to , i.e. indicates the difficulties in detecting the signal of small - scale velocity fluctuations along the los .",

    "wavelets are an appropriate tool to retrieve information on the distribution of power in space and time . with this technique we calculated 2d maps of power spectra in period bins of 20s from 70s up to 190s , i.e. the acoustic cutoff period .",
    "we employed the code by @xcite with morlet wavelets and a level of significance of 95% . an analogous equation to eq.[eq1 ] is then used in terms of periods @xmath21 ( with @xmath22=20s ) to determine the acoustic flux from the wavelet power averaged over time and fov .",

    "yet , a large difference appears at high frequencies , where the treatment of the fourier and wavelet analysis is different : ( 1 ) the wavelet approach is more restrictive in terms of noise when using a statistical significance level of 95% , therefore the retrieved values at these frequencies are low , ( 2 ) the wavelets were applied in period bins which reduces the spectral sampled points at high frequencies to just the bin at 80s and half of the bin at 100s , ( 3 ) the values at high frequencies are strongly corrected , i.e. the originally larger values in the fourier analysis spectra are highly increased .",

    "in addition , aliasing from power at frequencies above our nyquist frequency may play a role . with these caveats ,",
    "we consider the large fluxes at high frequencies as upper limits .",
    "the high frequency waves are most prone to radiative damping",
    ". their amplitudes will thus be strongly reduced at the base of the chromosphere .    in any case , even before correction , the directly measured energy fluxes are larger than those found in any previous observational study of acoustic waves .",
    "the nature of these results and their consequences are discussed in sect.[discussion ] .",
    "the wavelet analysis provides maps of wave power for each time step . with this technique applied to the high - spatial resolution imax data",

    "the time lag corresponding approximately to the travel time from the bottom of the photosphere to 250 km height is about 42s .",
    "the cadence of the time series is 33s , therefore no delay between intensity and power maps has been taken into account .",
    "the wave power , far from being homogenously distributed , appears intermittently in space and time as already found by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "histograms of the acoustic power occurrence over intensity represented in fig.[pow_cont ] show that most of the power , at all frequencies , is associated with _ dark _",
    "structures , i.e. structures with intensities @xmath26 . we have referred to these structures as _",
    "intergranules _ , but close inspection of the power maps overlaid on the continuum intensities ( see animation available at url , attached to this manuscript ) reveal that significant power is found in forming granular ( dark ) dots and lanes . a second",
    ", less prominent component or shoulder is seen in the histograms at @xmath27 .",
    "it has not been reported before , we see it thanks to the high contrast of the imax images .",
    "this power is found in small rapidly evolving granules , and in large granules ( 1 ) prior to their splitting and ( 2 ) at their bright borders . yet",
    "not all splitting granules and bright borders show a wave power component .      studying the evolution of acoustic power reveals patches of intense signal .",
    "they appear intermittently and randomly distributed , covering areas of typically 1arcsec@xmath28 and with power at all periods lasting for about 5min .",
    "such strong signals are found to be generated by rapid fluctuations in velocities up to @xmath04kms@xmath29 , that are of a diverse nature : ( 1 ) sudden ( within 23min ) up - down - up flows , ( 2 ) sudden down - up - down flows , ( 3 ) some associated to magnetic field concentrations , ( 4 ) some with no significant magnetism , ( 5 ) some of the latter related to imploding granular areas , etc .    in a first analysis ,",

    ", we find that they carry 2023kwm@xmath1 ( estimated values before and after correction , respectively ) .",
    "yet , their small area coverage , 0.1% of the fov , implies that their global contribution to the total flux is not significant .",
    "nevertheless , the identification of these energetic features at small scales from their strong power signature has opened a new field of study and we refer to a forthcoming contribution on the nature of these events .",
    "in this study we have taken advantage of the high quality data of the imax / sunrise instrument . the high spatial resolution provided new exciting findings , which ( a ) confirm that acoustic waves play an important role in the energy transport through the quiet solar atmosphere , ( b ) shed new light on the spatial and temporal distribution of propagating wave phenomena and",

    "after transmission correction , the imax data provide fluxes larger by a factor of 2 .",
    "we conclude that much of the power in the quiet sun occurs at small scales and high spatial resolution is mandatory to detect it .",
    "+ simulations by @xcite give an estimate of 30@xmath38 for energy losses between 250 km up to 500 km due to radiative damping .",
    "applying the same correction , the averaged acoustic flux we observe at 250 km would then be reduced to 4500wm@xmath1 at the bottom of the chromosphere . on the one hand ,",
    "the flux reduction between 250 km and 500 km may be larger because of the very small spatial scales in the present data set .",
    "on the other hand , the estimated flux at 250 km is only a lower - limit value since we have considered : ( i ) wavelet power , ( ii ) the conservative correction .",
    "this acoustic flux is comparable to the radiative losses of 4600wm@xmath1 quantified from the standard semi - empirical hydrostatic model of a quiet average chromosphere by @xcite .",
    "chromospheric models calculated including radiative losses from feii lines , arrive at energy needs of 14000wm@xmath1 @xcite . in our wavelet analysis , the contribution from high - frequency ( @xmath2510mhz ) waves is missing , but likely present in the solar atmosphere as suggested , e.g. the fourier analysis .",
    "let us recall the main findings of this first study on acoustic waves from imax / sunrise observations at disc centre : + 1 ) the improvement in at least a factor of 2 in spatial resolution and the image quality of imax / sunrise data have revealed a total acoustic power larger by at least a factor of 2 than the largest power observed before . in view of the results obtained on the total acoustic power ,",
    "we conclude that , at photospheric level , acoustic waves with periods @xmath25100s carry at least half of the flux needed to balance the observed radiative energy losses of the quiet chromosphere according to @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the quiet solar chromosphere is supplied with acoustic wave energy to cover its radiative losses , as suggested many years ago by l. biermann and m. schwarzschild and later on pursued intensively by p. ulmschneider , needs to be revived and intensively studied , probing which fraction of the transported energy reaches the chromosphere .",
    "+ 2 ) the main contribution to the acoustic energy flux is found in intergranules , as is extensively known .",
    "in addition , forming dark dots and lanes above splitting granules as well as small fast - evolving granules and the brighter borders of large granules are found to be sources of propagating waves . these are regions of strong dynamics ( turbulence ) as pointed out in the studies on the same imax data series by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "+ 3 ) thanks to the high quality of the imax data , it has been possible to detect intermittent sources of strong energy fluxes at all frequencies in the acoustic domain .",
    "a preliminary analysis of their nature shows that they are generated by rapid ( 23min ) fluctuations in their los velocity occurring at small scales , i.e. typically of 03@xmath503 .. they show a diverse origin , in some cases they are related to small magnetic field concentrations , in others to imploding granules , etc .",
