    "the classical no - hair conjecture first proposed by ruffini and wheeler @xcite states that after a given distribution of matter collapses to form a black hole , the only long range information of a black hole is its electromagnetic charge , mass and angular momentum . in certain special cases",
    "the conjecture has been verified .",
    "for example a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity in asymptotically flat or de sitter spacetimes can not provide hair for the black hole @xcite,@xcite .    while it is tempting to extend the no - hair theorem claim to all forms of matter , it is known that some long range yang - mills and/or quantum hair could be painted on the black holes @xcite .",
    "explicit calculations have been carried out which verify the existence of a long range nielsen - olesen vortex solution as a stable hair for a schwarzchild black hole in four dimensions @xcite , although it might be argued that this situation falls outside the scope of the classical no - hair theorem due to the non trivial topology of the string configuration .",
    "more recently it has been shown that an asymptotically flat black hole could be pierced by several infinitely thin cosmic strings in a polyhedral configuration @xcite .",
    "these is much current interest in extending these considerations to anti de sitter spacetime , mainly due to the efforts of  maldacena @xcite and witten @xcite concerning the relation of the some large @xmath0 gauge theories in ads spacetime and conformal field theories .",
    "insofar as the no - hair theorem is concerned it has been shown that there exists a solution to the @xmath1 einstein - yang - mills equations which describes a stable yang - mills hairy black hole that is asymptotically ads @xcite .",
    "more recently we have shown that the @xmath2 higgs field equations have a vortex solution in four dimensional ads spacetime @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been shown that in asymptotically ads spacetime , that a black hole can have scalar hair @xcite .    motivated by these considerations , in this article we investigate possible solutions of the abelian - higgs field equations in a four dimensional ads - schwarzschild black hole background .",
    "while an analytical solution to these equations appears to be intractable , we confirm but by numerical calculation that ads - schwarzscild black hole could support a long range cosmic string as its stable hair .",
    "the generalization to the multi - string configurations as a black hole hairs also could be done .    in section two",
    ", we solve the first - order einstein equations in the pure ads@xmath3 spacetime in the presence of a vortex solution . in section three ,",
    "we solve numerically the abelian - higgs equations in the ads - schwarzschild background for different values of the cosmological constant and string winding numbers . in section four , by studying the behaviour of the string energy - momentum tensor , we find the effect of the vortex self gravity on the ads - schwarzschild background metric .",
    "we argue in section five , that ads - schwarzschild black hole could support a multi - string configuration .",
    "we give some closing remarks in the final section .",
    "we consider first the effect of  the vortex on the ads@xmath4 spacetime .",
    "this entails finding the solutions of the coupled einstein - abelian higgs differential equations in ads@xmath4 .",
    "this is a formidable problem even for flat spacetime , and no exact solutions have been found  for the flat spacetime yet .",
    "however  some physical results can be obtained by making some approximations .",
    "first , we assume that the thickness of the vortex is much smaller that all the other relevant length scales .",
    "second , we assume that the gravitational effects of the string are weak enough so that the linearized einstein - abelian higgs differential equations are applicable",
    ".    for convenience , in this section we use the following form of the metric of ads@xmath5    @xmath6    this metric in spherical coordinates is suitable for generalizing the vortex self gravity in the presence of the ads - schwarzschild black hole . in the absence of the vortex , we must have @xmath7 , yielding the well known metric of pure ads@xmath4 .    employing the two assumptions concerning the thickness of the vortex core and its weak gravitational field , we solve numerically the einstein field equations , @xmath8 to the first order in @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the energy - momentum tensor of the abelian higgs field in the ads background .",
    "to first order of approximation by taking @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the usual ads@xmath13 metric , @xmath14 is the first order correction to the metric and writing @xmath15 we obtain corrections to the three functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 in ( [ abcexpa ] ) .",
    "hence in the first approximation the equations ( [ einstein ] ) become    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the energy momentum tensor of string field in ads@xmath20background metric , and @xmath21 is the correction to the einstein tensor due to @xmath22 .",
    "the rescaled components of the energy momentum tensor of string in the background of ads@xmath23 are given by , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the solutions of  the string fields @xcite and @xmath27 .",
    "the einstein equations ( [ eineq ] ) are @xmath28 solving equations of motions of the abelian higgs fields @xcite numerically gives the following graphs for @xmath25 and @xmath26 fields ( [ fig1 ] )    by using the equations ( [ stresssph ] ) , one could obtain the diagram ( [ fig2 ] ) showing the behaviour of stress tensor components .",
    "then solving the coupled differential equations ( [ eins ] ) gives the behaviour of functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 versus @xmath31 ( [ fig3 ] )    hence by a redefinition of time coordinate in ( [ abcmetric ] ) the metric can be rewritten as @xmath32 which is the metric of ads space with deficit angle .",
    "we take the abelian higgs lagrangian in ads - schwarzschild as follows ,    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is a complex  scalar klein - gordon field , @xmath36 is the field strength of  the electromagnetic field @xmath37 and @xmath38 in which @xmath39 is the covariant derivative .",
    "we employ planck units @xmath40 which implies that the planck mass is equal to unity , and write the ads - schwarzschild black hole metric in the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the black hole mass and the cosmological constant @xmath43 is equal to @xmath44 defining the real fields @xmath45 by the following equations    @xmath46    and employing a suitable choice of gauge , one could rewrite the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) and the equations of motion in terms of these fields as : @xmath47    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the field strength of the corresponding gauge field @xmath50 .",
    "note that the real field @xmath51 is not itself a physical quantity .",
    "superficially it appears not to contain any physical information .",
    "however if @xmath51 is not single valued this is no longer the case , and the resultant solutions are referred to as vortex solutions @xcite .  in this case the requirement that @xmath35 field be single - valued implies that the line integral of @xmath52 over any closed loop is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an integer . in this case",
    "the flux of electromagnetic field @xmath55passing through such a closed loop is quantized with quanta @xmath56    we seek a vortex solution for the abelian higgs lagrangian ( [ lag2 ] ) in the background of ads - schwarzschild black hole.this solution can be interpreted as a string piercing to the black hole ( [ adsmetr1 ] ) .",
    "considering the static case of winding number @xmath57 with the gauge choice , @xmath58 and rescaling @xmath59 where @xmath60 the equations of motion ( [ eqmo2 ] ) are    @xmath61    @xmath62    in the above relation ( [ eqp ] ) , @xmath63 it must be noted that even in the case of @xmath64 ,  no exact analytic solutions have been known for equations ( [ eqp ] ) and ( [ eqx ] ) .",
    "so , in the rest of this section , we seek the existence of vortex solutions for the above coupled non linear partial differential equations .",
    "first , we consider the _ thin _ string with winding number one , in which one can assume @xmath65 the thicker vortex and larger winding number will be discussed later in this section . employing the ansatz    @xmath66    where @xmath67 ,  we get the following equations :    @xmath68    @xmath69    as expected , in the limit @xmath70 equations ( [ eqx2 ] ) and ( [ eqp2 ] ) reduce to the asymptotically flat case discussed in @xcite . in this instance the vortex solutions of the abelian higgs equations in flat spacetime ( without a black hole ) satisfy the @xmath70 limit of equations ( [ eqp2 ] ) and ( [ eqx2 ] ) up to errors which are proportional to the @xmath71 these errors are very tiny far from the black hole horizon , whereas near the horizon @xmath72 they are of the order of @xmath73 which is negligible for large mass black holes .",
    "this observation suggested that a string vortex solution could be painted to the horizon of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this conjecture has been further supported by numerical calculations @xcite which show the existence of vortex solutions of the abelian higgs equations in the background of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "these calculations explicitly demonstrate that a cosmic string can pierce a black hole for a variety of black hole masses and vortex winding numbers .    for  finite @xmath74",
    ", we showed in our previous paper @xcite that the abelian higgs equations of motion  in the background of anti - de - sitter spacetime ( ( [ eqx2 ] ) and ( [ eqp2 ] ) in the limit of  @xmath64 ) have vortex solutions ( denoted by @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) with core radius @xmath77 .",
    "the functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 satisfy eqs .",
    "( [ eqx2 ] ) and ( [ eqp2 ] ) up to errors which are proportional to @xmath78 these errors go to zero far from the black hole . however near the horizon of  a large mass black hole , @xmath79 , the term @xmath80 is at least of  the order of unity , and so the possibility of painting a string vortex solution to the horizon for finite @xmath81 remains unclear .",
    "then we should go to perform the numerical calculations to show the existance of vortex solution on , near and far from the horizon .",
    "we pay attention now to the numerical solutions of the equations ( [ eqp ] ) and ( [ eqx ] ) outside the black hole horizon .",
    "first , we must take appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "at the large distance from the horizon , we demand that our solutions go to the  solutions of the vortex equations in ads spacetime given in @xcite .",
    "this means that we demand @xmath82 and @xmath83 as @xmath84 goes to infinity . on the symmetry axis of the string and beyond the radius of horizon @xmath85 , i.e. @xmath86 and @xmath87 , we take @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "finally , on the horizon , we initially take @xmath90 and @xmath91    we employ a polar grid of points @xmath92 where @xmath93 goes from @xmath94 to some large value of @xmath93 ( @xmath95 ) which is much greater than @xmath85 and @xmath96 runs from @xmath97 to @xmath98  we use the finite difference method and rewrite the non linear partial differential equation ( [ eqx ] ) as @xmath99    where @xmath100 for the interior grid points , the coefficients @xmath101 are given by , @xmath102    and for the points on the horizon @xmath103 , the coefficients are given by    @xmath104    the equation ( [ eqp ] ) could be rewritten as the same as the finite difference equation ( [ findiffxx ] ) by replacing @xmath105 to @xmath106 and the following form for the coefficients inside the grid @xmath107    on the horizon , the coefficients of the finite difference equation of @xmath26 field are    @xmath108    now , by using the well known successive overrelaxation method @xcite for the above mentioned finite difference equations , we obtain the values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 fields inside the grid , which we denote them by @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "then by calculating the @xmath93-gradients of @xmath25 and @xmath26 just outside the horizon and iterating the finite difference equations on the horizon , we get the new values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 fields on the horizon points",
    ". then these new values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 fields are used as the new boundary condition on the horizon for the next step in obtaining the values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 fields inside the grid which could be denoted by @xmath111 and @xmath112 . in the successive overrelaxation method ,",
    "the value of the each field in the @xmath113 -th iteration is related to the @xmath54-th iteration by    @xmath114    where residual matrix @xmath115 is the difference between the left and right hand sides of the equation ( [ findiffx][findiffxx ] ) , evaluated in the @xmath54-th iteration and @xmath51 is the overrelaxation parameter .",
    "the iteration is performed many times to some value @xmath116 such that @xmath117 for a given error @xmath118 .",
    "it is a matter of trial and error to find the value of @xmath51 that yields rapid convergence .",
    "the results of this calculation are displayed in figures ( [ fig4 ] ) to ( [ fig15 ] ) for different values of @xmath119 and @xmath70 and winding numbers @xmath120 in all of these figures , the black hole mass is taken have the constant value @xmath121 note that for @xmath122 figures ( [ fig12]-[fig15 ] ) are the same as the figures introduced in @xcite for the abelian - higgs model in the flat spacetime . like the flat spacetime case , in the ads spacetime , increasing the winding number yields a greater vortex thickness . comparing  figures ( [ fig6],[fig10 ] and [ fig15 ] )",
    "we see that as @xmath74 decreases the black hole is completely covered by a vortex of decreasingly large winding number .",
    "for example , for @xmath123 the black hole horizon is completely inside the core of a vortex with a winding numberof less than one hundred , but for @xmath124 this occurs for winding number about four hundred .    also , as figure ( [ fig16 ] ) shows , for a string with definite winding number , the string core increases with increasing @xmath125 but the ratio of string core to the black hole horizon decreases . alternatively from figure ( [ fig17 ] )",
    "we see the @xmath25  and @xmath26 fields more rapidly approach their respective maximum and minimum values in smaller angle as @xmath74 increases .",
    "we now consider the effect of  the vortex on the ads - schwarzschild black hole .",
    "as we have seen in section ( 2 ) , this is a formidable problem even for flat or ads spacetimes .    as in section ( 2 ) , we assume that the thickness of string is much smaller that all the other relevant length scales and the gravitational effects of the string are weak enough so that the linearized einstein - abelian higgs differential equations are applicable .",
    "so , we condsider thin string  with the winding number @xmath126 in the ads - schwarzschild background with @xmath123 .",

    "the behaviour of the components in the other @xmath128 is like the same as these figures .",
    "as it is clear from figures , the components of the energy - momentunm tensor rapidly go to zero outside the core string , so the situation is like what happened in the pure ads spacetime . then performing the same calculation as in the pure ads spacetime described in detail in section ( 2 ) , give us the following metric of the ads - schwarzschild spacetime incorporated the effect of the vortex on it ,    @xmath129    the above metric describes an ads - schwarzschild metric with a deficit angle .",
    "so , using a physical lagrangian based model , we have established that the presence of the cosmic string induces a deficit angle in the black hole metric .",
    "from the precceding sections we know that an ads - schwarzschild  black hole could support a long range nielsen - olesen vortex string as stable hair .",
    "the natural next question is , _ how many strings could be supported by such a black hole ?",
    "_    such a question was considered for the schwarzschild black hole . _",
    "_ in @xcite , a three string configuration in schwarzscild black hole was studied .",
    "also , in @xcite , all possible multistring configurations were presented .",
    "since the intersection of strings with the ads - schwarzschild black hole occurs on some points on the horizon which is topologically @xmath130 and such a situation also holds for the schwarzschild black hole whose horizon has spherical topology , we could use the same procedure as was presented in @xcite .",
    "so , we give an argument in brief to show the different possible multistring - ads schwarzschild black hole system .",
    "we assume strings enter the horizon along radii .",
    "the different polystring configurations are obtained by demanding that the black hole - multistring system must be invariant under any rotation about any axis which coincides with the strings .",
    "this condition is necessary since the black hole - multistring system must be in force - free equilibrium .",
    "the intersection of strings with the black hole occur on some points on the horizon which is topologically @xmath130 and these points are the vertexes of a spherical tesselation .",
    "the spherical tesselation is obtained by projection of the edges of a polyhedron from its geometrical center onto a concentric sphere . every edge and vertex of the polyhedron",
    "is mapped to an arc of a great circle on the sphere and a vertex of spherical tesselation respectively .",
    "the spherical tesselation is invariant under a discrete rotation group .",
    "the elements of this discrete group are just rotation around every axis which passes through the center of the sphere and vertices , mid - arc points and centers of  faces of  spherical tesselation , respectively .",
    "this discrete rotation group of the spherical tesselation is in correspondence with the rotational symmetry group of the polyhedron .",
    "so the black hole - polystring system with radial strings is invariant under discrete rotations and hence is in an equilibrium state .    by knowing the properties of spherical tesselation , in @xcite , the different multistring configurations are introduced .",
    "the first configuration is 14 strings which are pierced to the black hole on the symmetry axis of a tetrahedron .",
    "the second and third configurations are 26 and 62 strings which are pierced to the black hole on the symmetry axis of a octahedron and icosahedron respectively .",
    "the fourth configuration is 2n strings ( n is any arbitrary number ) which corresponds to the symmetry axis of a double pyramid .",
    "the effect of a vortex on pure ads spacetime to create a deficit angle in the metric in the thin vortex approximation .",
    "we have extended this result , establishing numerically that abelian higgs vortices of finite thickness can pierce an ads - schwarzschild black hole horizon .",
    "these solutions could thus be interpreted as stable abelian hair for the black hole .",
    "we have obtained numerical solutions for various cosmological constants and string winding numbers .",
    "our solutions in the limit of  @xmath131 coincides with the known solutions in the asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "we found that by increasing the winding number , the string core increases . also , the generalization to include piercing of more strings to the black hole has been considered and it is shown that there are four different polystring configurations .",
    "finally , inclusion of the self gravity of the vortex in the ads - schwarzschild background metric was shown to induce a deficit angle in the ads - schwarzschild metric .",
    "other related problems such as study of the vortex in the charged or rotating black hole backgrounds and non - abelian vortex solution in asymtotically ads spacetime remain to be carried out .",
    "another issue is the holographic description of vortex solution in these asymptotically ads spacetimes .",
    "work on these problems is in progress .",
