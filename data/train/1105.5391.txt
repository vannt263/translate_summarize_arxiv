    "in recent decades , black holes have started playing a key role in a variety of processes in astrophysics , gravitational wave physics and high - energy physics . following the 2005 breakthroughs @xcite , numerical relativity has been an essential tool in the modeling of black - hole binaries in the strong - field regime .",
    "at the same time it has become clear that detailed studies of black - hole systems often involve a close interplay between fully non - linear numerical simulations and approximation techniques of various types .",
    "for example , the generation of gravitational wave ( gw ) template banks for use in the analysis of observational data from laser interferometric gw detectors ligo , virgo , geo600 , lcgt or lisa requires the combination of numerical relativity with post - newtonian or other techniques ; see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "post - newtonian studies have also played an important role in the guidance of the numerical investigation of the black - hole recoil , most notably in the discovery of the so - called _ superkicks _ and its possible suppression due to spin alignment @xcite . in the context of high - energy collisions of black holes , linearization tools such as the zero - frequency limit or point - particle calculations provide valuable insight into the scattering threshold and gw emission of black - hole collisions in four and higher - dimensional spacetimes @xcite . a particular class of black - hole binaries of high relevance",
    "for the spaceborne lisa ( or a similar future spaceborne ) observatory , the so - called extreme - mass - ratio inspirals , represent a particularly difficult challenge to numerical relativity and their modeling relies heavily on perturbative methods and self - force calculations ; see refs . @xcite and references therein .    with the above as motivation ,",
    "it is vital to obtain a detailed understanding of the range of validity of the various types of approximation methods . at the same time",
    ", these methods provide valuable tools to calibrate the accuracy of numerically generated solutions to the einstein equations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide such a study for the case of a classical calculation in general relativity , the head - on infall of a point - particle ( pp ) into a black hole @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", numerical relativity has started probing the intermediate mass - ratio regime by evolving the final orbits of ( approximately ) quasi - circular inspirals of black - hole binaries with mass - ratio @xmath0 @xcite ; by comparing numerical results with perturbative calculations employing the fully numerical black - hole trajectories for mass ratios up to @xmath1 @xcite and most recently , the first numerical evolution of a black - hole binary with @xmath2 @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we restrict our attention on the head - on limit of the collision of black holes , for two reasons : ( i ) the lower computational cost due to the higher degree of spacetime symmetry and the absence of the lengthy inspiral phase and ( ii ) the availability of high - precision results in the pp limit .    in our study we will make extensive use of the calculation by davis _",
    "@xcite who model in the pp limit the collision of a small object of mass @xmath3 with a black hole of mass @xmath4 . in",
    "the original calculation the particle was falling from rest at infinity , and the total radiated energy was found to be @xmath5 this setting has been generalized to arbitrary initial distance and boost , in which case initial data and consequent spurious radiation play a role @xcite .",
    "fully numerical results for black - hole head - on collisions obtained in the equal and comparable mass regime have been compared with pp predictions and results obtained in the close - limit approximation @xcite by anninos and collaborators @xcite .",
    "these studies demonstrated agreement for the radiated energy and linear momentum bearing in mind the accuracies achievable at the time .",
    "however , the spurious radiation present in the initial data was not dealt with in a satisfactory manner .",
    "its presence contaminated the physical pulse and much of the conclusions in these earlier works were affected by this . in particular , the presence of spurious radiation prevented an accurate computation of the total radiation and comparison with the linearized , pp calculations .    also , we are not aware of any comparisons between pp calculations and fully numerical results for mass ratios in a truly perturbative regime . by simulating black - hole binaries up to a mass ratio of @xmath2",
    "we fill this gap and identify those aspects of the pp predictions which describe black - hole dynamics well in general and which only hold in the extreme mass - ratio limit . from a different point of view",
    ", the agreement with the pp calculations represents an important validation of the fully numerical calculations in the regime of high - mass ratios . in this context",
    "we emphasize that we are able to accurately extract from binary black - hole simulations radiated gw energies of the order of @xmath6 and linear momenta corresponding to recoil velocities of a few dozens of m / s , similar to the average speed of a normal car .",
    "we note , however , that even smaller amounts of energy have been extracted from general relativistic simulations of stellar core collapse ; see e.  g.  @xcite .",

    "iv  and conclude in sec .  v.",
    "the numerical simulations of unequal - mass black - hole collisions starting from rest have been performed with the lean code , originally introduced in ref .",
    "the lean code is based on the ` cactus ` computational toolkit @xcite and uses the ` carpet ` mesh refinement package @xcite , the apparent horizon finder ` ahfinderdirect ` @xcite and the twopuncture initial data solver  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 einstein s equations are evolved using the bssn @xcite formulation , together with the moving puncture approach @xcite .",
    "the gauge conditions are determined by the so - called puncture gauge , i.e. , the `` 1+log '' slicing and @xmath8 driver shift condition @xcite .",
    "the systems are set up using brill - lindquist initial data .",
    "we have evolved bh binaries with mass ratios @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the bare mass parameter of the @xmath12-th bh .",
    "we use the newman - penrose scalar @xmath13 to measure gravitational radiation at extraction radii @xmath14 , chosen in a range of @xmath15 to @xmath16 from the center of the collision .",
    "we decompose @xmath13 into multipoles @xmath17 using spherical harmonics of spin - weight @xmath18 , @xmath19 , according to @xmath20 . due to the symmetry properties of the systems under consideration ,",
    "the only non - vanishing multipoles all have @xmath21 in a suitably chosen frame , and are purely real , corresponding to a single polarization state @xmath22 . in the equal - mass limit , the additional symmetry causes all multipoles with odd @xmath23 to vanish identically .",
    "the energy spectrum and luminosity of the radiation are given by @xmath24 respectively , where a hat denotes the fourier transform and @xmath25 is evaluated on a sphere at infinity .",
    "we have performed a series of simulations of head - on collisions with mass ratio ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath2 with initial coordinate separation @xmath27 and proper horizon - to - horizon separation @xmath28 as given in table  [ tab : models ] .    .mass",

    "@xcite , two effects contribute to increasing the gw energy at larger initial separations ; ( i ) there is more time to radiate gws during the infall and ( ii ) the infalling velocity is larger . in practice , the second effect is found to be dominant .",
    "have accounted for both contributions by defining @xmath35 one can write the corrections to the radiation emission e^rad_l = f_le^rad_=(1- ) e^rad_+o().with the above as motivation , we have fitted our results to a @xmath36 dependence , of the form @xmath37 with @xmath38 the radiated energy for infinite initial separation .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : r0dependence ] .",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath28 stands for proper initial separation between the holes .",
    "we also note that the results in table [ tab : r0dependence ] are normalized by @xmath39 . for comparison",
    ", we also show in the last entry of the table the results obtained in the pp limit , within a linearized calculation .",
    "this study was done by lousto and price @xcite using the same type of initial data ; we have used their table i to obtain the behavior shown in table  [ tab : r0dependence ] above .",
    "we note that already for @xmath40 and @xmath2 our results are in good agreement with pp calculations .",
    "we remind the reader , however , that in the @xmath40 case there is a larger deviation in the @xmath32 modes .    with the extrapolation above one",
    "gets an estimate for the total radiation of two black holes merging from infinite initial separation . a best fit of this number as function of mass ratio yields @xmath41 in the pp limit , when @xmath42 , this agrees with the classical pp calculation , eq .",
    "( [ drpp ] ) to within @xmath43 , so within the numerical uncertainties .",
    "overall , the results in table [ tab : models ] demonstrate that we are able to accurately measure amounts of order @xmath44 in these fully nonlinear evolutions .",
    "the amount of spurious radiation in the initial data is also consistent with predictions from linearized gravity .",
    "lousto and price performed a detailed analysis of the amount of spurious radiation in the infall of pps into massive black holes , using the same type of initial data @xcite . using their table i for @xmath45",
    ", we find that the amount of spurious radiation varies with @xmath28 according to @xmath46 . for @xmath2 , for instance , we obtain @xmath47 .",
    "thus , we find good agreement in the decay power ( roughly @xmath48 ) and also in the proportionality coefficient .",
    "if two bhs with different masses collide head - on , the remnant bh will recoil with respect to the center - of - mass frame , due to the emission of energy and momentum carried by gravitational waves .",
    "based on pn tools , we have fit our results to @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a normalized recoil velocity for infinite initial separation .",
    "the normalized recoil velocity @xmath50 is shown in table [ tab : r0dependence ] .",
    "the point particle limit was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , who obtained @xmath51 .",
    "] we note this is not a trivial agreement : unlike energy calculations , momentum involves interference with higher ( typically highly suppressed ) multipoles .",
    "overall , our results agree well in the limit of small mass - ratios with the point particle limit .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context that for both , radiated energy and linear momentum , the numerical results exceed those obtained from the point particle limit by about @xmath52 .",
    "this value agrees in sign and magnitude with the discretization error obtained for the @xmath2 simulation in sec .",
    "[ sec : sims ] .",
    "we therefore consider the discretization error the dominant source of the remaining discrepancies .",
    "the simulation of dynamical , interacting black holes has a tremendous potential to provide answers to some of the most fundamental questions in physics .",
    "recent developments in experimental and theoretical physics make this a pressing issue .",
    "we refer , in particular , to the prominent role of bhs in the gauge - gravity duality , in tev - scale gravity or even on their own as solutions of the field equations @xcite .",
    "recent work along these lines includes the successful simulation and understanding of the collision of two bhs at close to the speed of light in four - dimensional spacetime @xcite , the low energy collisions in higher spacetime dimensions @xcite , bh scattering in five dimensions @xcite , stability studies in higher dimensions @xcite and bh evolutions in non asymptotically flat spacetimes @xcite ( for the formalism extension , we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we have shown here that numerical relativity is capable of simulating dynamical black holes close to the regime of validity of linear calculations , and to make contact with approximation techniques .",
    "for this purpose we have evolved head - on collisions of non - spinning black - hole binaries over a range of mass ratios from @xmath26 to @xmath2 .",
    "we obtain radiated energies decreasing from about @xmath53 for @xmath26 to @xmath54 for @xmath2 .",
    "the recoil reaches a maximum of about @xmath55 near @xmath56 and decreases towards @xmath57 for @xmath2 . in the limit of small mass ratios and extrapolating our results to infinite initial separation , we find the numerical values for radiated energy and linear momentum to be @xmath58 larger than the point - particle predictions .",
    "this discrepancy agrees rather well in sign and magnitude with the discretization error obtained from a convergence study of our @xmath2 simulations .",
    "it thus appears likely that a significant part of the remaining differences can be attributed to the discretization error which mirrors the computational demands of numerical black - hole binary simulations with such small mass ratios .    with regard to the waveforms ,",
    "the most remarkable result is the suppression of odd @xmath23 multipoles .",
    "while we observe good agreement between numerical and point - particle results for the @xmath31 mode , already for @xmath40 , the numerically calculated @xmath32 multipole is visibly suppressed for this case and only agrees well with the pp limit for @xmath2 .",
    "overall , the good agreement for waveforms and radiated energy and momenta for the case @xmath2 demonstrates that numerical techniques are capable of bridging the gap between linear analysis and the fully non - linear regime of general relativity .",
    "we thank ermis mitsou for sharing data from his earlier work @xcite , which helped assess the accuracy of our own pp waveforms and fluxes .",
