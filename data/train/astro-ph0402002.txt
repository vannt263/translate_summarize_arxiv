    "two of the most promising methods to measure cosmological parameters , in particular those describing dark energy , are distance measurements of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) and number counts of clusters of galaxies in the universe .",
    "sne ia have provided original direct evidence for dark energy ( riess et al .  1998 , perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ) ( for earlier , indirect evidence , see krauss and turner  1995 or ostriker and steinhardt  1995 ) and are currently the strongest direct probe of the expansion history of the universe ( tonry et al .",
    "2003 , knop et al .",
    "their principal strength is the simplicity of relating the observable  which is essentially the luminosity distance  to cosmological parameters , and also the fact that each supernova redshift - magnitude pair provides a distinct measurement of a combination of those parameters .",
    "number - counts , on the other hand , use the fact that galaxy clusters are the largest collapsed structures in the universe that have undergone a relatively small amount of post - processing . their distribution in redshift can be reliably calculated in a given cosmological model .",
    "the evolution of cluster abundance is principally sensitive to the comoving volume and growth of density perturbations ( haiman , mohr & holder 2001 ) and this cosmological probe is expected to reach its full potential with upcoming and future wide - field surveys .",
    "rapid improvement in the accuracy of measuring cosmological parameters implies that various systematic uncertainties , previously ignored , now have to be controlled and understood quantitatively . in the case of supernova measurements ,",
    "an example is provided by the proposed supernova / acceleration probe ( snap ) satellite ( akerlof et al .",
    "2004 ) whose goals for measuring the equation of state of dark energy @xmath3 and its variation with redshift @xmath4 drive the requirements on the systematic control that are considerably more stringent than those attainable with current surveys .",
    "similarly , the principal systematic difficulty in cluster counts is in establishing the relation between observable quantities ( x - ray temperature or sunyaev - zeldovich flux decrement ) , and the cluster s mass which is necessary for comparison with theory .",
    "the mass - temperature relation , for example , is known to have a considerable scatter and is currently poorly determined , with fairly large intrinsic statistical errors and considerable systematic disagreements between different authors ( see e.g. fig . 2 in huterer & white 2002 ) . the cleanest way to include",
    "the mass - observable relation might be to determine it from the survey itself ( this is known as `` self - calibration '' ; levine , schulz & white 2002 , majumdar & mohr 2003 , hu 2003 , lima & hu 2004 ) , but this will almost certainly lead to degradations in parameter accuracies .",
    "future surveys will require a careful accounting of all systematics  theoretical and observational .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on one of the most basic ingredients of supernova and cluster count measurements : the determination of redshift . in the case of sne",
    "ia spectroscopic observations are necessary to identify the supernova type , and redshift is then supplied for free .",
    "recently completed and ongoing surveys have sufficiently poor magnitude uncertainty and relatively low statistics and relatively weak control on known systematics , so that the spectroscopic redshift error is small enough for the redshifts to be considered perfectly known . however , as we shall see , future supernova observations require such accurate redshifts that even the spectroscopic accuracy is not _ a priori _ guaranteed to be sufficient .    in the cluster count case ,",
    "the situation is even more interesting , as spectroscopic observations will not be possible for all clusters , which may number in the tens of thousands .",
    "one will therefore rely on photometric redshifts .",
    "although photometric redshifts are already impressively accurate ( e.g. fernndez - soto et al .",
    "2002 , csabai et al .",
    "2003 , collister & lahav 2003 , vanzella et al .",
    "2003 ) , we shall find that their bias ( the difference between the mean photometric value and the true value at any redshift ) needs to be kept exceedingly small for the redshift error not to contribute appreciably to the total error budget .",
    "our analysis is timely , as follow - up surveys to obtain cluster redshifts , such as that at cerro - tololo international observatory , are about to get underway soon .",
    "our analysis also complements recent analysis of the effect of systematic errors on future sn ia measurements ( kim et al .",
    "2003 , frieman et al .",
    "2003 ) and a variety of related analyses regarding the cluster number - count surveys ( e.g. bartlett 2000 , holder & carlstrom 2001 , white , hernquist & springel 2002 , white , van waerbeke & mackey 2002 , benson , reichardt & kamionkowski 2002 , white 2003 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] we outline the procedure to include the redshift uncertainty in the standard fisher - matrix parameter estimation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sne ] we discuss the redshift requirements for future supernova surveys , while in sec .",

    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "our fiducial model is a flat universe with matter energy density relative to critical of @xmath5 and the equation of state of dark energy @xmath6 .",
    "other cosmological parameters , necessary for the cluster abundance calculation , are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : counts ] .",
    "let us assume we have an observable @xmath7 from which we want to determine @xmath8 cosmological parameters @xmath9 . since the number of observed objects is large ( thousands for future sne ia surveys and of order ten thousand for cluster surveys ) , we bin observations in @xmath10 redshift bins centered at @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) each with width @xmath13 .    to include the redshift uncertainty , we treat the bin centers @xmath14 as @xmath10 additional nuisance parameters @xmath15 .",
    "variation of any of these parameters moves the location of the whole corresponding redshift bin .",
    "we use the fisher matrix formalism in order to estimate all @xmath16 parameters simultaneously , and we give priors to redshift parameters that represent how accurately they are independently determined .    the @xmath17 fisher matrix is given by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the number of objects in the k - th bin .",
    "the observable @xmath20 is the mean apparent magnitude of a supernova @xmath21 in a given redshift bin , or else the number of clusters @xmath22 in a bin .",
    "note that the redshift parameter representing the @xmath23th bin affects the observable @xmath20 only if @xmath24",
    ". therefore    @xmath25\\ ] ]    and the expression for the fisher matrix simplifies accordingly for the redshift parameter terms .",
    "we assume the error in the observable @xmath20 is gaussian - distributed with standard deviation @xmath26 . with that assumption , any gaussian prior imposed on the individual object",
    ", @xmath27 will be equivalent to imposing a prior of @xmath28 on the observable representing the k - th redshift bin since there are @xmath19 objects in this bin .",
    "note that the number of redshift bins , @xmath10 , needs to be large enough to retain the shape information of the function @xmath7 ; we use steps of 0.02 for both sne ia and number counts , and have checked that a higher number of bins leads to negligible changes in all of our results . note too that these bins are used for computational accuracy ; they should not be confused with the _ physical _ redshift bins which are determined by the filter set of the experiment and which we later discuss . finally , we ignore the cosmic variance contribution to the error in number - count surveys , since it has been shown that cosmic variance becomes small for the high - redshift cluster surveys with relatively high mass threshold ( hu & kravtsov 2003 ) , which is the case we study in this paper .",
    "while our fisher matrix formalism assumes the redshift errors to be gaussian , it is conceivable that the errors will have significant non - gaussian tails and/or pronounced skewness .",
    "this may especially be true for the photometric redshift errors , where a small fraction of redshifts may have a large deviation from their true value .",
    "in this situation our formalism is still appropriate : by the central limit theorem ( and as confirmed with monte carlo ) the central ( mean ) value of any given redshift bin , @xmath29 , is guaranteed to have gaussian error dispersion ( whose center may be shifted from the true value of @xmath29 ) _ even if individual objects in this bin have errors that are strongly non - gaussian_. this fully justifies our use of gaussian priors on @xmath29 , and the same argument applies to other observables we consider  mean supernova magnitude and number of clusters in a redshift bin . in order to _ determine _ the resultant rms of @xmath29 and its bias ( shift relative to its true value )",
    ", however , one needs to know _ a priori _ the redshift distribution of objects and their measurement errors . while detailed modeling of the photometric redshift error ( taking into account various types of galaxies and their properties at any given redshift ) will require a monte carlo approach that is outside the scope of this work , here we explore results for a range of widths of the gaussian distribution of the redshift bin centers @xmath29 .",
    "the measurement of the cosmological parameters using calibrated candles requires both the magnitude and redshift of the object in question . in supernova studies",
    "the redshift measurement is typically taken from the spectrum of the host galaxy , either from sharp emission lines or from the 4000   break .",
    "up to the present , the magnitude error of high - redshift supernovae have dwarfed the redshift measurement error .",
    "as we enter an era of high - precision supernova cosmology , with significant improvement in statistical and systematic uncertainties , we need to explore the effects of redshift measurement error on the determination of cosmological parameters .",
    "cosmological observations of high - redshift supernovae are generally made in observer @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands which roughly correspond to supernova - frame @xmath32 and @xmath33 bands . observed type ia supernova magnitudes are modeled as @xmath34   & & \\mu(z;\\theta_i ) .",

    "the distance modulus @xmath41 is a function of redshift and the cosmological parameters .",
    "gravitational lensing magnification is not considered here since its effect on the inferred magnitudes of distant supernovae is not sensitive to small variations in redshift .",
    "the effect of redshift error on the estimated distance modulus is straightforward : a positive redshift error , @xmath42 , incorrectly gives an inflated distance to the supernova .",
    "in addition , the measurement of stretch is itself dependent on @xmath1 ; the stretch is obtained from the observed width @xmath43 of a light curve using the formula @xmath44 so that an error in @xmath1 propagates as @xmath45 .",
    "an overestimate of redshift gives an underestimate of the stretch factor and therefore an overestimate of the expected supernova magnitude .",
    "the extinction terms and k - correction depend on both redshift and stretch . expected observed colors with a fixed pair of filters near the restframe @xmath32 and @xmath33 are bluer for slightly higher redshift supernovae .",
    "an overestimated redshift will thus give an overestimated extinction determination .",
    "in contrast , the simultaneously underestimated stretch determination overestimates the intrinsic redness of the supernova , underestimating the extinction .",
    "additionally , stretch - dependent sed s and redshift errors introduce k - correction errors whose behavior depends on the specific redshift and filters involved .",
    "we propagate redshift errors into errors in the expected observed peak magnitude for a canonical supernova search .",
    "we adopt a filter - set consisting of redshifted @xmath32 filters such that the @xmath46-th filter has throughput @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is wavelength .",
    "we adopt the empirically derived @xmath49 stretch  magnitude relation found by perlmutter et al .",
    "the stretch - dependent supernova color is given as @xmath50 .",
    "we use the k - correction methodology given in nugent , kim , & perlmutter ( 2002 ) ; the observer filters with effective wavelengths closest to @xmath51 and @xmath52 are associated with rest - frame @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively . the host - galaxy extinction is assumed to obey the standard @xmath53 dust model of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : dmdz ] shows individual contributions to the derivative of magnitude with respect to redshift , @xmath54 , as well as their sum for an @xmath55 supernova .",
    "the k - correction and extinction errors are discontinuous and periodic in redshift as different observer filters are traversed .",
    "the distance modulus error , being proportional to the relative error in luminosity distance , @xmath56 , goes to infinity as redshift goes to zero .",
    "this is simple to understand , as in the @xmath57 limit @xmath58 approaches a constant , while @xmath59 itself goes to zero .",
    "therefore , low-@xmath1 supernovae have the most need for accurate redshifts ; we discuss this further below .",
    "note that the use of @xmath54 to assess the effect of redshift errors is only approximate since the k - corrections can be highly nonlinear ; however , the approximation is good for the span of redshift errors that we consider .",
    "we explore the effects of redshift error in the measurement of dark energy parameters based on a supernova search such as the proposed snap space telescope ( akerlof et al .",
    "as we discuss below , more powerful experiments require more stringent control of redshift errors ; therefore , our requirements for snap will be more than sufficient for other ground and space - based surveys in the next 5 - 10 years .",
    "we assume a supernova distribution with around 2700 sne distributed between @xmath60 and @xmath61 together with 300 additional low-@xmath1 ( @xmath62 ) sne from the ground - based sn factory ( aldering et al .",
    "the fiducial magnitude error per supernova , the quadratic sum of measurement error and intrinsic supernova magnitude dispersion , is 0.15 magnitudes .",

    "we consider the degradation , due to imperfectly known redshifts , of the accuracy in the equation of state of dark energy @xmath63 , where @xmath3 is assumed constant .",

    "we also consider the degradation in the accuracy in measuring the redshift evolution in the equation of state , @xmath4 , where @xmath67 ; in this case we further marginalize over @xmath68 and add a gaussian prior of @xmath69 to @xmath64 , to allow comparisons with other analyses in which this procedure has become standard .",
    "figure  [ fig : degrade_w ] shows the degradation in @xmath63 ( top panel ) and @xmath4 ( bottom panel ) as a function of the redshift error per supernova .",
    "the solid line shows the case when the redshift error is constant for all sne , whereas the dashed line represents an uncertainty growing as @xmath70 .",
    "the two cases are qualitatively similar , and show that , for example , a redshift error of 0.005 per sn leads to a 25% increase in @xmath63 and a 7% increase in @xmath71 .",
    "however , these results assume that the error in redshift , absolute or fractional , is the same at all redshifts . in reality",
    ", the sn factory spectra will have a fixed high resolution .",
    "the flatter pairs of lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : degrade_w ] assume that redshifts at @xmath0 have a fixed accuracy of 0.001 per sn , while those at @xmath72 have the accuracy shown .",
    "the degradation in @xmath3 or @xmath4 is now smaller than about 10% , even for errors of 0.02 for sne at @xmath72 !",
    "therefore , accurate redshifts of low-@xmath1 supernovae immunize against larger errors at higher redshifts .",
    "this conclusion is easy to understand : fixed error in redshift roughly corresponds to fixed error in distance to a supernova , while the total sn magnitude error increases linearly with distance . therefore , the redshift error contributes a larger percent of the total error budget for low - redshift supernovae .",
    "furthermore , low-@xmath1 supernovae are crucial for parameter determination and their omission ( or inclusion , but with large redshift error ) would lead to nearly a factor of two degradation in the constraints on @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( e.g. huterer & turner 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , provided that redshifts of low-@xmath1 supernovae are measured with high accuracy , measurements of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are weakly sensitive to the redshift errors of high-@xmath1 sne .",
    "+    for convenient reference , we associate redshift errors with the magnitude error that gives an equivalent uncertainty in @xmath3 ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : zerr_magerr ] .",
    "for example , a 0.005 redshift error introduces an uncertainty equivalent to the additional 0.1 intrinsic magnitude dispersion per sn . as before , the flatter pair of lines in the same figure shows the effect of accurate redshifts for @xmath0 sne , in which case the overall redshift uncertainty contributes little ( @xmath73 mag in the range of redshift errors shown ) to the total error budget .    the spectroscopic follow - up of high - redshift supernovae ( or more appropriately , their host galaxies ) from surveys must be carefully considered .",
    "ground - based spectroscopy associated with current high-@xmath1 supernova searches have more than sufficient resolution to measure redshifts to @xmath74 .",
    "( subpixel interpolation gives a wavelength resolution several times better than the instrumental resolution @xmath75 . )",
    "very wide - field supernova searches that discover thousands or more supernovae may depend on photometric redshifts as an alternative to spectroscopic followup .",
    "photometric redshift determination is currently limited by a statistical accuracy floor of a few percent ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : counts ] ) ; in this case the effect of redshift error can be comparable in size to the intrinsic corrected - magnitude dispersion of sne ia of @xmath760.1 mag , although we have just shown that accurate redshifts at @xmath0 will largely immunize against the overall redshift contribution to the error budget . of course , the two more serious problems are identification of sne ia and control of systematics , both of which are very difficult without their spectra .    in the case of a 2-m space telescope observing @xmath77 supernovae ( such as snap ) , the poisson noise from the zodiacal background and source can be low .",
    "considering the noise properties of hgcdte detectors , signal - to - noise arguments push for a low - resolution spectrograph to avoid a detector - noise - limited instrument . if the on - board",
    "spectrograph is to provide supernova redshifts , the competing needs for low and high resolution must be considered in the design .",
    "we end with several comments .",
    "first , we do not consider the peculiar velocities since they have negligible effect on high - redshift supernovae .",
    "second , our supernova calculations involve statistical magnitude errors only .",
    "adding the irreducible systematic error in each redshift bin , as done in frieman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for example , is straightforward and leads to a slight weakening of the required redshift accuracy .",
    "this is easy to understand , since the fiducial parameter accuracy , such as @xmath63 , slightly weakens in the presence of systematics , and the redshifts do not need to be known quite as accurately as in the perfect world without systematics .    finally , we comment on the possibility of using the _ photometric _ redshifts for non - local ( @xmath72 ) supernovae . in this approach",
    "one has to consider the irreducible redshift errors within coarse redshift bins ; this point is discussed in detail in   4.1 .",
    "in the supernova survey considered here , and assuming correlation length of @xmath78 in redshift , approximately 240 supernova would fall in each coarse redshift bin .",
    "a redshift uncertainty per supernova of @xmath79 can then be viewed as being equivalent to a redshift uncertainty per bin of @xmath80 .",
    "using this relation , figure 2 can provide a first estimate of the degradation in the measurement of @xmath3 and @xmath4 from these irreducible photometric errors .",
    "for example , a redshift bias per bin smaller than @xmath81 would be necessary to ensure that the degradation in the measurement of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is less that @xmath82 . clearly , photometric redshifts would need to be exceedingly accurate in order not to degrade the dark energy constraints from type ia supernovae .",
    "clusters can be found using their x - ray flux ; through their sunyaev - zeldovich temperature decrement , or through deflection of light from background galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing by the cluster .",
    "current or upcoming surveys specifically suited to find clusters include xmm serendipitous cluster survey ( romer et al .",
    "2001 ) xmm large scale structure survey ( pierre et al .",
    "2003 ) , acbar , sunyaev - zeldovich array , apex sz survey and atacama cosmology telescope .",
    "cluster cosmology will realize its full potential with future wide - field surveys , such as the south pole telescope ( spt ) , the space - based mission planck , the proposed space - based mission duet , and , in the next decade , snap .",
    "cluster redshifts are required in order to use clusters as a probe of cosmology , yet the large number of clusters expected in the aforementioned upcoming surveys ( thousands to tens of thousands ) makes it impractical to obtain their redshifts spectroscopically .",
    "therefore , cluster abundance studies will rely on the photometric redshifts .",
    "fortunately , cluster photometric redshifts are currently measured with very good accuracy ( e.g.  bahcall et al .",
    "2003 ) chiefly because the photo - z s of individual galaxies in the cluster can be averaged , leading to statistical errors in cluster redshifts of about 0.02 .",
    "however , goals for the cluster abundance surveys are set high  measuring the equation of state of dark energy @xmath3 to an accuracy of 5 - 10% and the power spectrum normalization @xmath83 to about 1%  and it is worthwhile to study the required photometric redshift accuracy in order to achieve this goal .",
    "previous studies of the cluster abundance ( haiman , mohr & holder 2001 , levine , schulz & white 2002 , battye & weller 2003 , hu & kravtsov 2003 , mohr & majumdar 2003a , molnar et al .",
    "2003 ) have explored the efficacy of cluster number counts as a probe of cosmology , but all assumed perfect knowledge of redshifts .",
    "we adopt the fiducial cosmological model which is in accordance with recent results from the wmap experiment ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( tegmark et al .  2003 ) .",
    "we assume a flat universe with matter energy density relative to critical @xmath5 , dark energy equation of state @xmath6 , and power spectrum normalization @xmath84 .",
    "we use the spectral index and physical matter and baryon energy densities with mean values @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "we add a fairly conservative prior of 5% to each of these parameters ; we checked that our results are insensitive to this prior .",
    "the parameters to which cluster surveys are most sensitive are @xmath64 , @xmath3 and @xmath83 , and we do not give any priors to these parameters .",
    "the fiducial surveys we consider determine @xmath64 and @xmath83 to accuracy of about 0.01 and @xmath3 to about 0.02 - 0.12 .",
    "we are , however , only interested in the _ degradation _ of these accuracies due to uncertain knowledge of redshifts , and this fact makes our results less dependent on the details of the survey .",
    "finally , for this analysis we assume that the mass - observable ( i.e. mass - temperature , or mass - x - ray flux ) relation is perfectly known .",
    "we have checked that leaving the normalization of this relation as a free parameter to be determined by the data can strongly degrade the fiducial parameter constraints , but it affects the sensitivity to the knowledge of redshifts , which we explore here , much more weakly .    to compute the comoving number of clusters we use the jenkins et al.(2001 ) mass function .",
    "the required input is the linear power spectrum ; for @xmath6 models , we use the formulae of eisenstein & hu ( 1997 ) which were fit to the numerical data produced by cmbfast ( seljak and zaldarriaga 1996 ) .",
    "we generalize the formulae to @xmath88 by appropriately modifying the growth function of density perturbations .",

    ".    an incorrect determination of individual cluster redshifts will lead to an incorrect central value of the redshift bin to which these clusters are assigned ( see below for the definition of redshift bins ) .",

    ", we further consider the spt survey with fixed limiting masses of @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 ; in our fiducial cosmology these three possibilities lead to about 95,000 , 20,000 and 1,700 clusters respectively .",
    "redshifts for the clusters are provided by optical and near - infrared photometric follow - up .",
    "these photometric redshifts are calibrated using supplemental spectroscopic observations of a galaxy subset .",

    "to represent the situation in a few years , we assume the redshift bin widths of @xmath110 at @xmath111 , keeping the error per bin the same ; this is roughly equivalent to doubling the error per redshift interval found at @xmath112 .",
    "we quantitatively discuss the redshift accuracy at high redshift in the following subsection .",
    "the _ purely statistical _ error in photometric redshifts , @xmath97 , is largely irrelevant for cosmological constraints , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma_bin ] ) , since the large number of clusters ( in all redshift bins except for those at the highest redshifts ) will make error per bin very small .",
    "therefore , the current statistical error with scatter of about @xmath113 in redshift contributes negligibly , by itself , to the total error budget , and we assume this statistical error for each individual cluster .",
    "however , we find that the results are sensitive to _ uncorrelated irreducible systematic _ errors in redshift bins , @xmath98 .",
    "the measurement of photometric redshift primarily relies on the position of the 4000  break . for each redshift",
    "there is a corresponding filter ( or overlapping filter pair ) which is sensitive at @xmath114 .",
    "galaxies at similar redshift and whose redshift determinations rely primarily on the same filters are thus susceptible to common systematic errors .",

    "we see that the x - ray survey is most sensitive to this redshift error ; this is not surprising as the x - ray survey runs out of clusters at @xmath115 ( most of them are actually at @xmath116 ) and hence uses a shorter lever arm in redshift than sz surveys .",
    "the differences in various curves show the dependence of the sensitivity of @xmath63 on details of the survey and , in particular , of the definition of the minimal cluster mass .",
    "the irreducible error per bin has to be kept below 0.001 - 0.005 , depending on the survey details , in order for it not to contribute more than @xmath117 to the error in @xmath3 and other cosmological parameters .",
    "furthermore , we have explored a range of fiducial surveys , varying the parameter set , sky coverage , and the details of the mass - observable relation , and found that surveys with less power to measure cosmological parameters typically have weaker requirements on the redshift accuracy . while we have shown a range of possibilities in fig .",
    "[ fig : degrade_w.dndz ] , we note that the exact requirements on the redshift accuracy for any given survey will be known only after the survey in question has started its operation and the accuracy of cluster mass determination from the observed flux or temperature becomes known .",
    "we mentioned earlier that the future accuracy of photometric redshifts at @xmath118 is uncertain .",
    "we explore the accuracy in measuring @xmath3 on redshift information at @xmath119 where we let @xmath120 vary between 0.8 and 3.0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : z_break ] shows that not obtaining redshifts for clusters at such redshifts can significantly degrade the performance of sz surveys ( x - ray survey do not have this problem , since they have very few clusters at @xmath118 ) .",
    "redshift information is assumed to be perfect at @xmath121 , while at @xmath119 we alternatively assume no redshift information ( solid lines ) , irreducible errors of 0.05 per redshift bin width of @xmath122 ( dashed lines ) and 0.02 per redshift bin ( dotted lines ) .",
    "we show cases for the flux - limited spt and for the same experiment with fixed @xmath93 .",
    "this figure shows that , while missing information at @xmath123 can be tolerated , having some redshift information in the region @xmath124 is very important . while photometric redshifts in this intermediate interval are difficult to obtain because of the lack of prominent features , we see that relatively modest information ( redshift bias accurate to about 0.05 _ per bin _ ) is sufficient to recover most of the information obtainable with perfect - redshift accuracy .",
    "we also checked that the error degradations in @xmath64 and @xmath83 are very similar to that in @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we note that our cluster count requirements were based on the degradation in the accuracy of measuring equation of state @xmath3 , which , in our fiducial surveys , is measured to accuracy @xmath125 .",
    "weaker constraints on @xmath3 , due to the inclusion of systematics , new parameters ( such as the mass - observable normalization and slope ) , or else due to smaller sky coverage of the survey , will lead to _ weaker _ redshift requirements .",
    "nevertheless , precision measurement of dark energy parameters is one of the principal goals of future number - count surveys , and it is expected that they will be powerful enough to complement concurrent supernova surveys . therefore , redshift control less stringent than that advocated here would weaken the power of number count surveys to probe dark energy .",
    "we considered how inexact redshifts affect future sne ia and number - count surveys .",
    "we treated the redshifts as additional parameters whom we assigned priors equal to their assumed measurement accuracy . requiring that the redshift uncertainty do not contribute more than @xmath117 to the error budget in cosmological parameters , we imposed requirements on the redshift accuracy .    for a future survey",
    "that studies @xmath126 supernovae out to @xmath127 ( e.g.  the snap space telescope ) we find that , with accurate redshift measurements of @xmath128 for @xmath0 supernovae , fairly poor redshift measurements can be tolerated at higher redshifts . without this accurate measurement at low redshift ,",
    "however , a fairly precise redshift measurement of @xmath129 would be required over the full redshift range .",
    "photometric redshifts are probably not an option , since spectral information is necessary to identify the sn type and control a variety of systematic errors .",
    "spectroscopy can be provided using sub - pixel interpolation of galaxy data from an on - board low - dispersion @xmath130 spectrograph ( which is designed to measure broad supernova features ) .",
    "supplemental high - resolution ground - based observations using 10m - class telescopes , adaptive optics , and oh suppression can provide precise redshifts as necessary and to cross - check the redshifts from the low - dispersion spectrograph .",
    "we thus conclude that redshift uncertainty will not significantly contribute to the error budget in the accurate measurement of dark - energy parameters that snap can deliver .    for future wide - field cluster count surveys , such as spt , planck or duet , we find that the purely statistical errors are largely irrelevant as long as they are reasonably small ( error of @xmath131 per cluster ) because they will average out due to the large number of clusters around any given redshift .",
    "however , the irreducible , systematic error that does nt decrease with increasing number of clusters drives the redshift requirements .",
    "this irreducible redshift - independent error has to be kept below 0.001 - 0.005 per redshift bin .",
    "the widths of the redshift bins are determined by how the redshift signature ( say , the 4000  break line ) goes through the filter set of the redshift follow - up experiment , and here for illustration we assumed filters from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "we found that the typical required redshift accuracy is more stringent for x - ray surveys since they have few clusters at @xmath118 and therefore use a shorter lever arm in redshift .",
    "sz surveys benefit from their longer lever arm , but , of course , only if their high - redshift clusters have decent redshift information . obtaining redshifts for high - redshift clusters ,",
    "therefore , should be an important goal of any redshift follow - up survey .",
    "while the photometric accuracy at redshifts greater than unity is highly uncertain at present , our analysis indicates that the lack of redshift information at @xmath123 does not significantly degrade the cosmological constraints , while at redshifts @xmath132 crude photometric information is sufficient to assure small degradation in constraints on @xmath3 ( see fig .
