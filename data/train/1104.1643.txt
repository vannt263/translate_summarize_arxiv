    "it is then clear that the projection onto the hamiltonian , which does contain the operator @xmath186 itself , will give the dominant contribution to the thermal expectation value .      finally , we consider the non - integrable _ extended hubbard model _ obtained by turning on the next - nearest neighbor repulsion @xmath65 in eq .",

    "the charge and spin distributions are identical for all times and @xmath229 , but for increasing @xmath64 the spin velocity @xmath225 decreases .",

    "the development of new spectroscopic techniques to study ultracold quantum gases on optical lattices with very good spatial and time resolution has put the topic of non - equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems firmly back onto the agenda . particularly interesting from a fundamental persepective",
    "is the dynamics in one dimension where many of the standard lattice models such as the heisenberg , the @xmath233 , and the hubbard model are integrable , i.e. , these systems have an infinite number of local conservation laws . since a conserved quantity stays invariant under time evolution , the presence of many conserved quantities is expected to severely restrict the dynamics of the quantum system as a whole and might even prevent the system from reaching thermal equilibrium . to investigate such questions numerically ,",
    "different algorithms have been developed : the time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group ( t - dmrg ) and the time - evolving block decimation ( tebd ) , in particular , allow one to access the intermediate time dynamics by representing the time evolved state as a matrix product state . among the aims when developing numerical algorithms to study the time evolution are ( a ) the thermodynamic limit , ( b ) the flexibility to simulate different systems , ( c ) a high computational efficiency , and ( d ) to simulate the system for as long as possible .",
    "here we have presented a new algorithm which does make progress concerning many of the points mentioned above .",
    "the light cone renormalization group ( lcrg ) algorithm is highly efficient by simulating at each time step only that part of the lattice ( a light cone ) which is affected by the time evolution .",
    "the results obtained are directly for the thermodynamic limit .",
    "contrary to the infinite size tebd , the lcrg algorithm does not rely on translational invariance .",
    "it is therefore extremely flexible and can , in particular , also deal with non - translationally invariant problems .",
    "it can not , however , simulate the quantum system for times significantly longer than other algorithms based on matrix product states .",
    "we have shown that the lattice path integral representation of unitary time evolution  forming the basis for the lcrg algorithm  provides a simple picture for the linear entanglement growth with time which restricts the simulation time of such algorithms .",

    "we used the lcrg algorithm to study quench dynamics in the integrable hubbard model starting from a state with every second site doubly occupied and found indications for a pure power - law relaxation .",
    "for the extended non - integrable hubbard model , on the contrary , the relaxation appears to be exponential . in both cases we found that the time evolved state in the long - time limit seems to be close to a thermal state supporting the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis .",
    "finally , we demonstrated that the lcrg algorithm can also be used to study the time evolution of non - translationally invariant initial states .",
