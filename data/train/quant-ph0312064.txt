    "in quantum information processing  @xcite , the spin of a spin-@xmath0 particle is often utilized as a qubit regardless of the momentum state of the particle",
    ". however , the spin and momentum are not , in general , separable in the relativistic regime , since the lorentz transformation ( lt ) entangles them via the wigner rotation  @xcite . among recent work  @xcite on entanglement in relativity , peres et al .  showed that the spin entropy of a spin-@xmath0 particle is not invariant under the lt unless the particle is in the momentum eigenstate  @xcite .",
    "this means that even if the spin is in a pure state in one frame of reference , it may not be so in another unless the entanglement with the momentum is taken into account .",
    "thus , the spin alone can not be used as a qubit in quantum information processing that involves relativistically moving observers .    in this paper",
    ", we address the question of how the spin of a particle moving in a gravitational field decoheres due to the effects of general relativity . in general relativity , a gravitational field",
    "is represented by a spacetime curvature , which entails a breakdown of the global rotational symmetry .",
    "the spin in general relativity can therefore be defined only locally by invoking the rotational symmetry of the local inertial frame . as a consequence of this local definition ,",
    "the motion of the particle is accompanied by a continuous succession of lts .",
    "we shall show that this effect , which is caused by spacetime curvature , gives rise to a spin entropy production that is unique to general relativity .",
    "this means that even if the state of the spin is pure at one spacetime point , it , in general , becomes mixed at an other spacetime point . as an illuminating example , we shall show that the spin entropy of a circularly moving particle changes extremely rapidly near the event horizon of a black hole in a local inertial frame that is static with respect to a killing time at each point .",
    "it is here in order to remark two important distinctions between the present general - relativistic problem and the special - relativistic one discussed in refs .",
    "first , while spin entropy is not invariant under the lt in special relativity  @xcite , it _ is _ invariant under the general coordinate transformation ( gct ) in general relativity .",
    "the spin is defined relative to the local inertial frame , which is physically determined by the spacetime distribution of matter , whereas the gct is an artificial relabeling of spacetime points , and therefore does not affect the local inertial frame , leaving the spin state invariant .",
    "the transformation that changes the spin entropy is a local lt of the local inertial frame .",
    "second , while in special relativity spin entropy is altered by changing the inertial frame , in general relativity spin entropy can change by a _ mere translation _ of the particle even though both the general coordinate system and the local inertial frame are fixed at each point ; here the spin entropy can be generated because local inertial frames at different points are , in general , different , as shown below .",
    "an entropy production of this type can not be found in other general - relativistic problems that do not involve the spin degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : formulation ] explains our formulation of a relativistic spin in a curved spacetime .",
    "section  [ sec : decoherence ] shows that a spin decoherence is caused by spacetime curvature .",
    "section  [ sec : example ] considers an example in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "section  [ sec : conclude ] summarizes our results .",
    "a gravitational field in general relativity is described by a curved spacetime with metric @xmath1 . to discuss the spin of a particle in the curved spacetime",
    ", we introduce a local inertial frame at each point . the coordinate transformation from a general coordinate system @xmath2 to the local inertial frame @xmath3 at each point",
    "can be carried out using a vierbein ( or a tetrad ) @xmath4 defined by  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the minkowski metric . here and henceforth , it is assumed that latin and greek letters run over the four inertial - coordinate labels @xmath7 and the four general - coordinate labels , respectively , and that repeated indices are to be summed .",
    "the vierbein transforms a tensor in a general coordinate system @xmath2 into that in a local inertial frame @xmath3 , and vice versa .",
    "for example , momentum @xmath8 in the general coordinate system can be transformed into that in the local inertial frame at @xmath2 via the relation @xmath9 .",
    "the inverse of the vierbein @xmath10 is defined by @xmath11    the choice of the local inertial frame is not unique , since the inertial frame remains inertial under the lt .",
    "the choice of the vierbein therefore has the same degree of freedom known as the local lt .",
    "it is this degree of freedom that transforms the spin of a particle .",
    "namely , a spin-@xmath0 particle in the curved spacetime is defined as a particle whose one - particle states furnish the spin-@xmath0 representation of the local lt , not of the gct .",
    "note that the dirac field in the curved spacetime is spinor under the local lt , whereas it is scalar under the gct .",
    "usually , the definition of a particle is not unique in quantum field theory in curved spacetime  @xcite , because we can not uniquely choose the time coordinate to define the positive energy .",
    "however , in the present formulation , our particle is specified by the choice of the vierbein , since @xmath12 generates a preferred global time coordinate from the local inertial time coordinate ( the @xmath13-axis ) .",
    "consider a wave packet of a spin-@xmath0 particle with mass @xmath14 in the curved spacetime .",
    "we assume that the spacetime scale of the wave packet is sufficiently small compared with that over which the curvature changes .",
    "this assumption allows us to refer to the wave packet as a `` particle . ''",
    "let us suppose that the centroid of the wave packet is located at point @xmath2 and is moving with four - velocity @xmath15 , which is normalized as @xmath16 ; this motion is not necessarily geodesic in the presence of an external force .",
    "the momentum of the centroid is then given by @xmath17 $ ] in the local inertial frame at the point @xmath2 . moreover , using this local inertial frame , we can describe the wave packet as in special relativity .",
    "namely , the momentum eigenstate @xmath18 of the particle is labeled by the four - momentum @xmath19 and by the @xmath20-component @xmath21 ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) of the spin  @xcite .",
    "the wave packet is then expressed as a linear combination of @xmath18 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a lorentz - invariant volume element . from the normalization condition",
    "@xmath26 we find that the coefficient @xmath27 satisfies @xmath28 taking the trace of the density matrix @xmath29 over the momentum , we obtain the reduced density matrix for the spin , @xmath30 the spin entropy of the wave packet is the von neumann entropy of this reduced density matrix : @xmath31.\\ ] ]    it is important to note that the spin index @xmath21 denotes not dirac spin but wigner one  @xcite , which is based on the poincar symmetry . using the pauli matrices @xmath32 , wigner spin operator for the wave packet",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath33 while dirac spin operator is given by @xmath34_{mn }   \\hat{\\psi}_n(x):,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 @xmath36 is a dirac spinor field and the colons @xmath37 mean the normal ordering .",
    "as is well known , dirac spin is not a conserved quantity , since @xmath38 does not commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "in contrast , wigner spin is a conserved quantity , since @xmath39 does commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "because wigner spin is defined using the particle s rest frame , it is analogous to the non - relativistic spin .",
    "thus , with wigner spin , we can discuss a spin observable even in a relativistic regime .",
    "after an infinitesimal proper time @xmath40 , the centroid of the wave packet moves to a new point @xmath41 , and the wave packet is then described by the local inertial frame at the new point @xmath42 . in the new local inertial frame , the momentum of the centroid changes to @xmath43 due to an acceleration by the external force _ and _ due to a change in the local inertial frame .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath44 is given by  @xcite @xmath45d\\tau , \\label{eq : delq}\\ ] ] where @xmath46\\ ] ] is the acceleration by the external force and @xmath47\\ ] ] is the change in the local inertial frame along @xmath48 . since @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the change @xmath51 may be interpreted as a local lt @xmath52 , where @xmath53+{\\chi^{a}_{\\phantom{a}b}}(x ) .",
    "\\label{eq : ill}\\ ] ] while the first term due to the acceleration exists even in special relativity , the second term due to the spacetime curvature is unique to general relativity .",
    "note that even if the wave packet moves as straight as possible ( i.e. , moves along a geodesic curve @xmath54 ) , this lt may be nonzero in general relativity . by iterating this infinitesimal transformation",
    ", we obtain a transformation formula for a finite proper time as a time - ordered dyson series , since @xmath55 s at different points do not necessarily commute .",
    "when the centroid of the wave packet moves along a path @xmath56 from @xmath57 to @xmath58 , the motion of the wave packet is accompanied by a lt given by @xmath59 , \\label{eq : ll}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the time - ordering operator .",
    "since the spin entropy is not invariant under the lt , neither is it invariant during the motion of the wave packet .",
    "note that the momentum eigenstate @xmath18 transforms under a lt @xmath61 as  @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the @xmath64 unitary matrix that represents the wigner rotation @xmath65 ; the explicit form of the wigner rotation reads @xmath66{^{a}_{\\phantom{a}b } } , \\label{eq : wigner}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 describes a standard lt defined by @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "since the wigner rotation of the spin depends on the momentum , the lt entangles the spin with the momentum . in accordance with the lt ( [ eq : ll ] ) induced by the motion of the wave packet ,",
    "the reduced density matrix for the spin in the local inertial frame at @xmath71 becomes @xmath72 this reduced density matrix @xmath73 at @xmath74 , in general , represents a mixed state , even if the initial reduced density matrix @xmath75 represents a pure state at @xmath76 .",
    "this means that the spin entropy is generated by both gravity and acceleration during the motion of the wave packet .",
    "as an illustrative example , we consider the schwarzschild spacetime  @xcite , @xmath77 where @xmath78 , with @xmath79 being the schwarzschild radius . at this radius ,",
    "the spacetime has the event horizon , on which the coordinate system @xmath80 breaks down . the time coordinate @xmath81 is known as a killing time , with respect to which the schwarzschild spacetime is static . in the schwarzschild spacetime",
    ", we introduce a static observer with a static local inertial frame at each point by choosing the vierbein ( [ eq : vierbein ] ) as @xmath82 with all the other components being zero .",
    "below , only non - zero components are shown .",
    "note that the inertial frame is defined at each instant , since the observer is accelerated to keep staying at the given point .",
    "such an accelerated observer would perceive the hawking radiation  @xcite if the state of the quantum field is represented in a fock space which is defined using the kruskal time .",
    "however , in the present example , the observer does not suffer from the hawking radiation , because we consider a fock space which is defined using the killing time .",
    "actually , by the choice of the vierbein ( [ eq : stvb ] ) , the local inertial time coordinate @xmath83 is parallel to the killing time coordinate @xmath81 .",
    "suppose that the centroid of the wave packet is moving along a circular trajectory of radius @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) with a constant velocity @xmath86 on the equatorial plane @xmath87 .",
    "the four - velocity of the centroid is then given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the rapidity in the local inertial frame defined by @xmath90 accordingly , in the local inertial frame at any point , the four - momentum of the centroid becomes @xmath91 .",
    "we assume that the coefficient of the wave packet at @xmath76 is @xmath92    \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad{}\\times     \\sqrt{\\,\\delta(p^1)\\,\\delta(p^2)\\,},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is gaussian in @xmath93 with the spin @xmath20-component @xmath94 , even though @xmath95 and @xmath96 have the definite value @xmath13 .",
    "the spin entropy of this wave packet is zero at time @xmath76 , since the momentum is not entangled with the spin .",
    "since the wave packet is not in a geodesic motion , the first term in the infinitesimal lt ( [ eq : ill ] ) is not zero in this example , giving rise to a generalized thomas precession  @xcite in the curved spacetime .",
    "this effect is an origin of the spin - orbit coupling and contributes to the spin entropy even in the limit of minkowski spacetime @xmath97 .",
    "in contrast , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ill ] ) , which consists of a boost along the @xmath98-axis @xmath99 and a rotation about the @xmath100-axis @xmath101 causes the spin decoherence that is unique to general relativity .",
    "in fact , in the limit of minkowski spacetime , this term is reduced to a pure rotation , which does not change the spin entropy as shown below .    combining these terms , we see that the infinitesimal lt @xmath55 becomes @xmath102 where @xmath103\\sqrt{f(r)}.\\ ] ] after a proper time @xmath104 of the particle , the wigner rotation ( [ eq : wigner ] ) for the finite lt ( [ eq : ll ] ) is reduced to a rotation about the @xmath100-axis through angle @xmath105 , where @xmath106l.\\ ] ] the first and second terms in @xmath107 correspond to the rotation part ( [ eq : rot ] ) and the boost part ( [ eq : boo ] ) , respectively .",
    "the corresponding unitary representation can be expressed in terms of the pauli matrix @xmath108 as @xmath109 therefore , the reduced density matrix at @xmath74 becomes @xmath110   \\overline{\\sin\\omega\\tau_p } &   1-\\overline{\\cos\\omega\\tau_p }    \\end{array}\\right),\\ ] ] where the overline means the average over the momentum distribution , @xmath111 where @xmath112.\\ ] ] note that only the @xmath113-dependent term in @xmath107 , which arises from the boost part ( [ eq : boo ] ) , contributes to the spin entropy .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath114 and @xmath115 , since @xmath116 if the wave packet is in the momentum eigenstate @xmath117 , spin entropy is not generated , i.e. @xmath118 , since then the second inequality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prange ] ) is saturated .    in the case of @xmath119 ,",
    "expanding @xmath107 around @xmath120 up to the second order in @xmath121 , we obtain @xmath122,\\ ] ] where @xmath123 , \\\\    b & = & \\frac{lw\\tanh\\xi}{mc }    \\left[\\frac{1}{\\cosh\\xi}-\\frac{1}{\\cosh\\xi+1}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we thus find that the reduced density matrix decoheres to a mixed state @xmath124 after the proper time @xmath125 and becomes maximally mixed ( @xmath126 ) in the limit of @xmath127 , as shown in fig .",

    "the proper time is normalized by @xmath133 . ]",
    "no revival of coherence occurs as opposed to the case of an electron in an atom . in this latter case",
    "the electron has a discrete spectrum and no real decoherence occurs , while in our case the momentum distributes continuously due to a semiclassical prescription in which the orbital motion is fixed to a given one by an appropriate external force at a macroscopic radius .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the inverse of the characteristic decoherence time , i.e. @xmath134 , as a function of @xmath135 .",

    "the spin decoherence is extremely rapid near the event horizon , because @xmath143 becomes very large as @xmath84 approaches @xmath79 .",
    "we emphasize that this is true even when the wave packet moves with non - relativistic velocity , if @xmath84 is sufficiently close to @xmath79 or if @xmath144 is sufficiently large .",
    "in particular , right on the event horizon , the reduced density matrix becomes maximally mixed in an infinitesimal proper time .",
    "of course , the formula ( [ eq : genent ] ) no longer holds inside the event horizon @xmath145 , since the strong gravity makes it impossible for the particle to move circularly . at the spatial infinity @xmath146 ,",
    "on the other hand , the reduced density matrix remains pure ( @xmath118 ) , since both gravity and acceleration vanish there .",
    "an interesting situation occurs on the sphere of the radius @xmath147 , on which the reduced density matrix does not decohere because the lt caused by gravity is canceled by that caused by acceleration , giving @xmath148 .",
    "in contrast to the static observer , an observer moving with the wave packet does not see the spin decoherence , because @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delq ] ) is zero in the co - moving local inertial frame .",
    "however , these two results do not contradict each other , since the spin entropy is not invariant under the lt from a static local inertial frame to a co - moving one .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that spin entropy is generated when a spin-@xmath0 particle moves in a gravitational field .",
    "even if the spin at one spacetime point is in a pure state , it may evolve into a mixed state as the particle moves .",
    "in particular , the spin entropy of a circularly moving particle increases very rapidly near the event horizon of the schwarzschild black hole . unless the entanglement with the momentum is taken into account , the spin can not be used as a qubit in quantum information processing where the system is subject to a strong gravitational field .",
