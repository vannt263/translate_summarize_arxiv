    "we work at three different values of the dynamical quark mass : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 corresponding to @xmath9-ratios of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "our lightest quark - mass is approximately equal to the strange quark - mass . up to now",
    "we generated about 8000 trajectories of unit - length with a time - step of @xmath13 .",
    "after measuring the integrated autocorrelation time for the plaquette and the pion - correlator at fixed timeslice @xcite we decided to use configurations separated by 25 trajectories for the present spectrum analysis .",
    "our sample consists of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath14 configurations for our 3 sea - quark values .",
    "since we aim at a final sample of @xmath16 configurations this talk should be considered as a half - time status report .",
    "quark propagators for the set of valence @xmath17-values \\ { 0.1555 , 0.1560 , 0.1565 , 0.1570 , 0.1575 } were computed using the standard overrelaxed minimal residual algorithm with smeared sources and local as well as smeared sinks .",
    "we used the wuppertal gauge - invariant gaussian smearing method with @xmath18 iterations and @xmath19 , fitting the hadron - correlators to single - exponential functions . throughout this analyis",

    "on our present statistics , uncorrelated data analyses of @xmath20- and @xmath21 distributions allow for stable chiral extrapolations in valence quark mass , @xmath22 .",
    "we find the @xmath23-meson mass to be be consistent with a linear chiral ansatz , while the remaining quantities considered exhibit _ nonlinear _ behaviour in @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath24 varies on the level of 15 % across our range of sea quark masses .",
    "baryon masses and decay constants so far indicate a trend but produce no compelling evidence for such variation .",
    "chiral extrapolations of our present data in @xmath25 itself still carry too large uncertainties to be reliable .",
