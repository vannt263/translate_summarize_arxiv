    "various modern ( semi)phenomenological nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials  @xcite adjusted to the nucleon - nucleon data allow for a relatively good description of few - nucleon systems . moreover ,",
    "the existing models of a three nucleon force ( 3nf ) when combined with those potentials led generally to an improvement in the description of three and four nucleon bound states  @xcite and reactions in the 3n - continuum  @xcite . despite indisputable successes such forces lack reliable theoretical justification in the underlying theory of strong interactions - the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "recently , a new family of nuclear potentials has been derived  @xcite which has a direct connection to qcd . incorporating the spontaneously and explicitly broken chiral symmetry , which plays a fundamental role in qcd",
    ", it is possible to construct nuclear forces in the framework of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "this approach has been originally proposed by weinberg  @xcite and further developed by ordez et al .",
    "@xcite , kaiser et al .",
    "@xcite , entem et al .",
    "@xcite , and by epelbaum et al .  @xcite .",
    "( see also recent review articles  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "up to now , nn and 3n forces have been worked out and applied in few - nucleon systems up to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath3lo ) and next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath4lo ) , respectively .",
    "the leading 4n - forces have also been worked out recently  @xcite .",
    "the chiral forces have already been successfully used to describe the elastic nucleon - deuteron scattering  @xcite and the deuteron breakup processes  @xcite .",
    "we remind the reader that applications of chiral nuclear forces are limited to the low - energy region .",
    "chiral effective field theory has also been used to study processes with external pions and/or photons , see  @xcite for some recent applications .",
    "while the neutron - proton radiative capture has already been considered in this framework  @xcite , no such analysis is available for electromagnetic processes with three nucleons . in this study",
    "we would like , at least partially , to fill this gap by presenting for the first time the chiral predictions for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 processes .",
    "we use the chiral nn potentials  @xcite at next - to leading order ( nlo ) , next - to - next - to leading order ( n@xmath4lo ) and at next - to - next - to - next - to leading order ( n@xmath3lo ) of chiral expansion . in the n@xmath4lo where the 3nf contributes for the first time",
    ", we also include such 3nf s  @xcite consistent with the two - body interaction at this order .",
    "a complete study of electromagnetic processes in the chiral effective field theory would require the usage of the nuclear electromagnetic current operator derived consistently with the applied nuclear forces .",
    "such a current operator is , however , not yet available , see ref .",
    "@xcite for some early work along these lines .",
    "for that reason , we decided to adopt in the present study our standard approach  @xcite , in which the electromagnetic current operator is taken in the form of a one - body current supplemented with some many - body contributions introduced via the siegert theorem .    in section 2",
    "we shortly describe our theoretical formalism .",
    "results and a comparison to data are presented in section 3 .",
    "we summarize in section 4 .",
    "the present study is based on the formalism described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the calculations are done for the two - body photodisintegration of the 3n bound state and the nuclear matrix element for the radiative @xmath7-capture @xmath8 is found by applying the time reversal to the photodisintegration amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "the latter one is a matrix element of the electromagnetic current operator @xmath10 between the initial 3n bound state @xmath11 and the final scattering state @xmath12 @xmath13 in the faddeev scheme @xmath9 can be written in the form  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a faddeev component of the state @xmath12 and @xmath16 is a permutation operator defined as a sum of cyclical and anti - cyclical permutations of three particles @xmath17 where @xmath18 interchanges the i - th and j - th nucleons .",
    "starting from the schrdinger equation for the scattering state @xmath12 the transition amplitude can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a product of the internal deuteron state and a momentum eigenstate of the free nucleon - deuteron motion .",
    "the auxiliary state @xmath21 fulfills the faddeev - like equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a part of the 3nf which is symmetrical under the exchange of nucleons 2 and 3 , @xmath24 is the free three - nucleon propagator , and @xmath25 is the two - body t - operator acting in the 2 - 3 subspace",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : utilde ] ) is solved in the momentum - space basis @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the magnitudes of the two jacobi momenta .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the two - body subsystem orbital angular momentum , spin and the total angular momentum , respectively .",
    "the orbital angular momentum @xmath32 of the spectator nucleon together with its spin @xmath33 couples to the total spectator angular momentum @xmath34 . the angular momenta @xmath31 and @xmath34 couple finally to the total angular momentum of the 3n system @xmath35 .",
    "similar coupling @xmath36 occurs for the isospin quantum numbers .",
    "starting from the transition matrix element @xmath37 the observables follow in a standard way  @xcite .",
    "the chiral potentials depend on low energy constants ( lec ) and the cut - off parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the lec s are determined for given @xmath38 and @xmath39 from a fit to nn and 3n data",
    ". the @xmath38 cut - off appears in the spectral function regularization  @xcite and ensures that the high - momentum components of the two - pion exchange are explicitly excluded from the potential .",
    "the cut - off @xmath39 comes from a further regularization of the potential as used in the lippmann - schwinger equation , which cuts off the ( meaningless ) contributions of high - momentum states in the dynamical equation .",
    "we performed numerical calculations for a few combinations of @xmath40 values which covers the possible ranges of the regularization parameters : ( 450(400 at nlo ) , 500 ) , ( 600(550 at nlo),500(600 at n@xmath3lo ) ) , ( 550,600 ) , ( 450(400 at nlo),700 ) , ( 600(550 at nlo),700 ) ( in units of @xmath41 $ ] ) .",
    "the theoretical predictions at a given chiral order provide a band comprising all results .",
    "the bands presented in the following correspond to the nn potential at nlo , n@xmath4lo , nn+3nf at n@xmath4lo , and finally to the nn potential at n@xmath3lo .",
    "let us start the presentation of our results with the c.m .",
    "differential cross section for the neutron - deuteron ( figs .",
    "[ fig1a]-[fig2 ] ) and proton - deuteron ( figs .",
    "[ fig3a]-[fig4 ] ) capture . in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] we display predictions at incoming neutron lab .",
    "energy @xmath42=9 mev and 10.8 mev .",
    "the light ( cyan ) band corresponds to nlo predictions while the dark ( red ) one refers to the full ( i.e. nn+3nf ) n@xmath4lo results .",
    "while the nlo band is relatively broad , the n@xmath4lo band is much narrower .",
    "this shows the fast convergence of the chiral expansion for this observable .",
    "the nn+3nf n@xmath4lo chiral predictions are in agreement with the av18+urbana ix combination of the standard nn and 3nf models obtained using the same current operator . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show a scale of 3nf effects at n@xmath4lo by comparison predictions which corresponds to the full hamiltonian ( dark band ) and other ones which corresponds to the interaction restricted to the nn force only ( light band ) .",
    "results obtained with nn force at n@xmath4lo are similar to those at nlo .",
    "due to the width of the nn band it is difficult to conclude if the inclusion of the 3nf improves or not the description of the data , however the 3nf effects are clear .",
    "there is an improvement at smaller @xmath43 angles but at larger angles the data favour the pure nn predictions .",
    "the comparison between n@xmath4lo and n@xmath3lo based on nn interactions only is shown in fig .",
    "the inclusion of the additional terms appearing in n@xmath3lo ( without corresponding 3nfs ) shifts the predictions above those of n@xmath4lo and brings them above the data",
    ". it would be interesting to see if the inclusion of the 3nfs in n@xmath3lo will decrease the cross section bringing theory back to the data , similarly as it is the case at n@xmath4lo .    in figs .",
    "[ fig3a]-[fig4 ] proton - deuteron capture cross sections are shown at two incoming deuteron lab .",
    "energies , e@xmath44=29 and 95 mev .",
    "the nice convergence of chiral expansion is seen at both energies ( see fig .  [ fig3a ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , at smaller deuteron energy e@xmath44=29 mev the inclusion of the 3nf in n@xmath4lo shifts the results in the wrong direction , deteriorating the description of data . passing to ( incomplete )",
    "n@xmath3lo improves the agreement with data . at the much higher deuteron energy e@xmath44=95",
    "mev the 3nf acts in the opposite direction , undoubtedly improving the data description . at this energy",
    "there is no difference between predictions at n@xmath4lo and n@xmath3lo based on the nn interactions only .",
    "however , the band of predictions at n@xmath3lo is much broader than the corresponding one at n@xmath4lo .",
    "now let us discuss selected spin observables .",
    "we would like to show results for the deuteron vector analyzing power @xmath1 ( figs .",
    "[ fig5a]-[fig6 ] ) and the deuteron tensor analyzing power @xmath2 ( figs .",
    "[ fig7a]-[fig8 ] ) at four deuteron energies 17.5 mev , 29 mev , 45 mev and 95 mev , for which comparison with data is possible . here",
    ", the convergence of the chiral expansion is much slower ( see figs .",
    "[ fig5a ] and  [ fig7a ] ) and the bands have more or less the same width . at the highest deuteron energy e@xmath44=95 mev for @xmath1",
    "the n@xmath4lo band is even wider than that one in nlo .",
    "the effects of the 3nf at n@xmath4lo on @xmath1 are not substantial and are seen mainly at the highest deuteron energy .",
    "the observed discrepancy with the data might at least partially be caused by the simplified model of the electromagnetic operator used in the present calculations .",
    "( the results based on the av18+urbana ix potential and a more realistic model of the current operator is shown in  @xcite where a better agreement with data was found . )",
    "the effects of the new terms occurring in the nn potential in n@xmath3lo are small , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . at the three lower energies they slightly shift predictions in the data direction . at the highest energy",
    "the picture for @xmath1 is similar when including the 3nf or the new n@xmath3lo terms .",
    "however , in the first case the band of predictions is much broader .",
    "similarly to the @xmath1 case , the effects of moving from nlo to n@xmath4lo , as well as the 3nf effects for @xmath2 ( figs .",
    "[ fig7a]-[fig7 ] ) are not significant .",
    "the discrepancy between av18+urbana ix and the chiral predictions for the higher energies of 45 mev and 95 mev is particularly interesting . at these energies",
    "the step to the next order in the chiral expansion seems to be necessary ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the additional terms in the n@xmath3lo nn chiral potential shift predictions farther away from the data .",
    "this points to the need of developing the corresponding 3n forces , which is under way .",
    "the first predictions for radiative nucleon - deuteron capture based on chiral forces are presented . the differential cross section and the deuteron vector and tensor analyzing powers",
    "have been calculated using the chiral nn potential at nlo , n@xmath4lo and n@xmath3lo .",
    "also the results at n@xmath4lo with the chiral 3nf of that order are shown .",
    "the nuclear current operator contains , besides the single nucleon current , some many - body contributions as introduced via the siegert theorem .",
    "the chiral potentials give similar predictions as the av18+urbana ix combination of the standard nuclear forces .",
    "we found , however , a significant theoretical uncertainty for all considered observables .",
    "the bands of predictions are in some cases too broad , especially in the n@xmath3lo nn and n@xmath4lo nn+3nf cases , to make a decisive conclusion about the quality of the nd - capture data description .",
    "this broadness can be partially caused by the inconsistent current operator used in this study . in future studies",
    "the nuclear current constructed in the same framework as chiral forces should be used .",
    "this first study indicates that the inclusion of the consistent current operator and going to n3lo in the chiral expansion might be necessary to obtain a more precise description of radiative processes within the chiral effective field theory framework .",
    "however , we have shown that already now this framework can be used for analyzing low energy electromagnetic processes .",
