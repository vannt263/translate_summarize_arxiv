    "the cmb is a nearly perfect blackbody of @xmath13 @xcite , with a @xmath14 dipole associated with the 300 @xmath15 flow of the earth in the cmb , and a rich pattern of higher multipole anisotropies at tens of @xmath16k arising from fluctuations at photon decoupling and later .",
    "spectral distortions from the blackbody associated with starbursting galaxies detected in the cobe firas and dirbe data are due to stellar and accretion disk radiation being downshifted into the infrared by dust then redshifted into the submillimetre ; they have energy about twice all that in optical light , about a tenth of a percent of that in the cmb .",
    "the spectrally well - defined sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) distortion associated with compton - upscattering of cmb photons from hot gas has not been observed with firas , but only at high resolution along lines - of - sight through dozens of clusters  with very high signal - to - noise though .",
    "the firas 95% cl upper limit of @xmath17 of the energy in the cmb is compatible with the @xmath18 expected from clusters , groups and filaments in structure formation models , and places strong constraints on the allowed amount of earlier energy injection , ruling out mostly hydrodynamic models of lss .    * upper limit experiments from the 70s & 80s :",
    "* the story of the experimental quest for anisotropies is a heroic one .",
    "the original 1965 penzias and wilson discovery paper quoted angular anisotropies below @xmath19 , but by the late sixties @xmath20 limits were reached , by partridge and wilkinson and by conklin and bracewell . as calculations of baryon - dominated adiabatic and isocurvature models improved in the 70s and early 80s , the theoretical expectation was that the experimentalists just had to get to @xmath21 , as they did , boynton and partridge in 73 .",
    "the only signal found was the dipole , hinted at by conklin and bracewell in 73 , but found definitively in berkeley and princeton balloon experiments in the late 70s , along with upper limits on the quadrupole . throughout the 1980s",
    ", the upper limits kept coming down , punctuated by a few experiments widely used by theorists to constrain models : the small angle 84 uson and wilkinson and 87 ovro limits , the large angle 81 melchiorri limit , early ( 87 ) limits from the large angle tenerife experiment , the small angle ratan-600 limits , the @xmath22-beam relict-1 satellite limit of 87 , and lubin and meinhold s 89 half - degree south pole limit , marking a first assault on the peak .",
    "these upper limit experiments were highly useful , in particular to rule out adiabatic baryon - dominated models . in the early 80s , dark matter dominated universes lowered theoretical predictions by about an order of magnitude .",
    "in the 84 to mid-90s period , many groups developed codes to solve the perturbed boltzmann ",
    "einstein equations when dark matter was present .",
    "armed with these pre - cobe computations , plus the lss information of the time , a number of very interesting models fell victim to the data : scale invariant isocurvature cold dark matter models in 86 , large regions of parameter space for isocurvature baryon models in 87 , inflation models with radically broken scale invariance leading to enhanced power on large scales in 87 - 89 , cdm models with a decaying ( @xmath23 ) neutrino if its lifetime was too long ( @xmath24 ) in 87 and 91 .",
    "also in this period there were some limited constraints on `` standard '' cdm models , restricting @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and the amplitude parameter @xmath27 .",
    "( @xmath28 is a bandpower for density fluctuations on a scale associated with rare clusters of galaxies , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 . )",
    "* post - dmr experiments : * the now familiar motley pattern of anisotropies associated with @xmath31 multipoles at the @xmath32 level revealed by cobe at @xmath22 resolution was shortly followed by detections , and a few upper limits ( ul ) , at higher @xmath33 in 19 other ground - based ( gb ) or balloon - borne ( bb ) experiments  most with many fewer resolution elements than the 600 or so for cobe . some predated in design and even data delivery the 1992 cobe announcement .",
    "proceeding from the period we began analyzing them , we have the intermediate angle sp91 ( gb ) , the large angle firs ( bb ) , both with strong hints of detection before cobe , then , post - cobe , more tenerife ( gb ) , max ( bb ) , msam ( bb ) , white - dish ( gb , ul ) , argo ( bb ) , sp94 ( gb ) , sk93 - 95 ( gb ) , python ( gb ) , bam ( bb ) , cat ( gb ) , ovro-22 ( gb ) , suzie ( gb , ul ) , qmap ( bb ) , viper ( gb ) and python v ( gb ) . a list valid to april 1999 with associated bandpowers is given in @xcite , and are referred here as 4.99 data .",
    "they showed evidence for a first peak @xcite , although it was not well localized . within limited parameter sets , good constraints on @xmath34 ,",
    "some on @xmath25 and @xmath35 could be given , when lss was added .",
    "* the present , toco , boomerang & maxima : * the picture dramatically improved this year , as results were announced first in summer 99 from the ground - based toco experiment in chile @xcite , then in november 99 from the north american balloon test flight of boomerang @xcite .",
    "these two additions improved peak localization and gave evidence for @xmath36 .",
    "then in april 2000 results from the first cmb long duration balloon ( ldb ) flight , boomerang @xcite , were announced , followed in may 2000 by results from the night flight of maxima @xcite .",
    "boomerang s best resolution was @xmath37 , about 40 times better than that of cobe , with tens of thousands of resolution elements .",
    "maxima had a similar resolution but covered an order of magnitude less sky .",
    "boomerang carried a 1.2 m telescope with 16 bolometers cooled to 300 mk in the focal plane aloft from mcmurdo bay in antarctica in late december 1998 , circled the pole for 10.6 days and landed just 50 km from the launch site , only slightly damaged . in @xcite , maps at 90 , 150 and 220 ghz showed the same spatial features and the intensities were shown to fall precisely on the cmb blackbody curve .",
    "the fourth frequency channel at 400 ghz is dust - dominated .",
    "[ fig : mapcldat ] shows the 150 ghz map derived using only one of the 16 bolometers .",
    "although boomerang altogether probed 1800 square degrees , only the region in the rectangle covering 440 square degrees was used in the analysis described in @xcite and this paper .",
    "[ fig : mapcldat ] also shows the 124 square degree region of the sky ( in the northern hemisphere ) that maxima-1 probed . though maxima was not an ldb , it did so well because its bolometers were cooled even more than boomerang s , to 100 mk , leading to higher sensitivity per unit observing time , it had a star camera so the pointing was well determined , and , further , all frequency channels were used in creating its map .    * primary cmb processes and soundwave maps at decoupling : * both boomerang and maxima were designed to measure the _ primary _ anisotropies of the cmb , those which can be calculated using linear perturbation theory . what we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : mapcldat ] are , basically , two images of soundwave patterns that existed about 300,000 years after the big bang , when the photons were freed from the plasma .",
    "the visually evident structure on degree scales is even more apparent in the power spectra of the fourier transform of the maps , which show a dominant ( first acoustic ) peak , a less prominent ( or non - existent ) second one , and the possible hint of a third one from maxima .",
    "[ fig : mapcldat ] also shows that the quite heterogeneous 4.99+toco+boomerang - na mix of cmb data is very consistent with what boomerang - ldb and maxima show .",
    "the images are actually a projected mixture of dominant and subdominant physical processes through the photon decoupling `` surface '' , a fuzzy wall at redshift @xmath38 , when the universe passed from optically thick to thin to thomson scattering over a comoving distance @xmath39 . prior to this",
    ", acoustic wave patterns in the tightly - coupled photon - baryon fluid on scales below the comoving `` sound crossing distance '' at decoupling , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 physical ) , were viscously damped , strongly so on scales below the @xmath39 thickness over which decoupling occurred .",
    "after , photons freely - streamed along geodesics to us , mapping ( through the angular diameter distance relation ) the post - decoupling spatial structures in the temperature to the angular patterns we observe now as the _ primary _ cmb anisotropies .",
    "the maps are images projected through the fuzzy decoupling surface of the acoustic waves ( photon bunching ) , the electron flow ( doppler effect ) and the gravitational potential peaks and troughs ( `` naive '' sachs - wolfe effect ) back then .",
    "free - streaming along our ( linearly perturbed ) past light cone leaves the pattern largely unaffected , except that temporal evolution in the gravitational potential wells as the photons propagate through them leaves a further @xmath42 imprint , called the integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "intense theoretical work over three decades has put accurate calculations of this linear cosmological radiative transfer on a firm footing , and there is a speedy , publicly available and widely used code for evaluation of anisotropies in a variety of cosmological scenarios , `` cmbfast '' @xcite , including the latest hydrogen / helium recombination evaluations , and with extensions to more cosmological models added by a variety of researchers .",
    "of course there are a number of nonlinear effects that are also present in the maps .",
    "these _ secondary _ anisotropies include weak - lensing by intervening mass , thompson - scattering by the nonlinear flowing gas once it became `` reionized '' at @xmath43 , the thermal and kinematic sz effects , and the red - shifted emission from dusty galaxies .",
    "they all leave non - gaussian imprints on the cmb sky .    * the future , beyond 2000 : * we are only at the beginning of the high precision cmb era .",
    "hemt - based interferometers are already in place taking data : the vsa ( very small array ) in tenerife , the cbi ( cosmic background imager ) in chile , dasi ( degree angular scale interferometer ) at the south pole , where the bolometer - based single dish acbar experiment will operate this year .",
    "other ldbs will be flying within the next few years : arkeops , tophat , beast / boost ; and in 2001 , boomerang will fly again , this time concentrating on polarization . as well",
    ", maxima will fly as the polarization - targeting maxipol . in april 2001",
    ", nasa will launch the all - sky hemt - based map satellite , with @xmath44 resolution .",
    "further downstream , in 2007 , esa will launch the bolometer+hemt - based planck satellite , with @xmath45 resolution .",
    "secondary anisotropies are also being targeted with new instruments .",
    "sz anisotropies have been probed by single dishes , the ovro and bima mm arrays , and the ryle interferometer .",
    "a number of planned hemt - based interferometers being built are more ambitious : ami ( britain ) , the jca ( chicago ) , amiba ( taiwan ) , mint ( princeton ) . as well other kinds of bolometer - based experiments will be used to probe the sz effect , including the cso ( caltech submm observatory ) with bolocam on mauna kea , acbar at the south pole , the lmt ( large mm telescope ) in mexico , and the ldb blast .",
    "anisotropies from dust emission from high redshift galaxies are being targeted by the jcmt with the scuba bolometer array , the ovro mm interferometer , the cso , the sma ( submm array ) on mauna kea , the lmt , the ambitious us / eso alma mm array in chile , the ldb blast , and esa s first satellite . about @xmath46 of the submm background has so far been identified with sources that scuba has found .",
    "* the cmb analysis pipeline : * analyzing boomerang and other experiments involves a pipeline that takes ( 1 ) the timestream in each of the bolometer channels coming from the balloon plus information on where it is pointing and turns it into ( 2 ) spatial maps for each frequency characterized by average temperature fluctuation values in each pixel ( fig .  [ fig : mapcldat ] ) and a pixel - pixel correlation matrix characterizing the noise , from which various statistical quantities are derived , in particular ( 3 ) the temperature power spectrum as a function of multipole ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mapcldat ] ) , grouped into bands , and two band - band error matrices which together determine the full likelihood distribution of the bandpowers  @xcite .",
    "fundamental to the first step is the extraction of the sky signal from the noise , using the only information we have , the pointing matrix mapping a bit in time onto a pixel position on the sky .",
    "there is generally another step in between ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , namely separating the multifrequency spatial maps into the physical components on the sky : the primary cmb , the thermal and kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effects , the dust , synchrotron and bremsstrahlung galactic signals , the extragalactic radio and submillimetre sources .",
    "the strong agreement among the boomerang maps indicates that to first order we can ignore this step , but it has to be taken into account as the precision increases . the fig .",
    "[ fig : mapcldat ] map is consistent with a gaussian distribution , thus fully characterized by just the power spectrum .",
    "higher order ( concentration ) statistics ( 3,4-point functions , ) tell us of non - gaussian aspects , necessarily expected from the galactic foreground and extragalactic source signals , but possible even in the early universe fluctuations .",
    "for example , though non - gaussianity occurs only in the more baroque inflation models of quantum noise , it is a necessary outcome of defect - driven models of structure formation .",
    "( peaks compatible with fig .",
    "[ fig : mapcldat ] do not appear in non - baroque defect models , which now appear unlikely . ) though great strides have been made in the analysis of boomerang and maxima , there is intense needed effort worldwide now to develop new fast algorithms to deal with the looming megapixel datasets of ldbs and the satellites  @xcite .",
    "* parameters of structure formation : * for this paper , we adopt a restricted set of 8 cosmological parameters , augmenting the basic 7 used in @xcite , @xmath47 , by one .",
    "the vacuum or dark energy encoded in the cosmological constant @xmath35 is reinterpreted as @xmath8 , the energy in a scalar field @xmath48 which dominates at late times , which , unlike @xmath49 , could have complex dynamics associated with it .",
    "@xmath48 is now often termed a quintessence field - see http://feynman.princeton.edu/  steinh/ `` quintessence ? - an overview '' for a pedagogical introduction .",
    "one popular phenomenology is to add one more parameter , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the pressure and density of the @xmath48-field , related to its kinetic and potential energy by @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "thus @xmath55 for the cosmological constant .",
    "spatial fluctuations of @xmath48 are expected to leave a direct imprint on the cmb for small @xmath33 , typically smaller than boomerang or maxima are sensitive to .",
    "we ignore this complication here . as well , as long as @xmath9 is not exactly @xmath12 , it will vary with time , but the data will have to improve for there to be sensitivity to this , and for now we can just interpret @xmath9 as an appropriate time - average of the equation of state .",
    "the curvature energy @xmath56 also can dominate at late times , as well as affecting the geometry .",
    "we use only 2 parameters to characterize the early universe primordial power spectrum of gravitational potential fluctuations @xmath57 , one giving the overall power spectrum amplitude @xmath58 , and one defining the shape , a spectral tilt @xmath59 , at some ( comoving ) normalization wavenumber @xmath60 .",
    "we really need another 2 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , associated with the gravitational wave component . in inflation ,",
    "the amplitude ratio is related to @xmath63 to lowest order , with @xmath64 corrections at higher order , @xcite .",
    "there are also useful limiting cases for the @xmath65 relation .",
    "however , as one allows the baroqueness of the inflation models to increase , one can entertain essentially any power spectrum ( fully @xmath66-dependent @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) if one is artful enough in designing inflaton potential surfaces .",
    "as well , one can have more types of modes present , scalar isocurvature modes ( @xmath69 ) in addition to , or in place of , the scalar curvature modes ( @xmath70 )",
    ". however , our philosophy is consider minimal models first , then see how progressive relaxation of the constraints on the inflation models , at the expense of increasing baroqueness , causes the parameter errors to open up .",
    "for example , with cobe - dmr and boomerang , we can probe the gw contribution , but the data are not powerful enough to determine much .",
    "planck can in principle probe the gravity wave contribution reasonably well .",
    "we use another 2 parameters to characterize the transport of the radiation through the era of photon decoupling , which is sensitive to the physical density of the various species of particles present then , @xmath71 .",
    "we really need 4 : @xmath72 for the baryons , @xmath73 for the cold dark matter , @xmath74 for the hot dark matter ( massive but light neutrinos ) , and @xmath75 for the relativistic particles present at that time ( photons , very light neutrinos , and possibly weakly interacting products of late time particle decays ) . for simplicity ,",
    "though , we restrict ourselves to the conventional 3 species of relativistic neutrinos plus photons , with @xmath75 therefore fixed by the cmb temperature and the relationship between the neutrino and photon temperatures determined by the extra photon entropy accompanying @xmath76 annihilation . of particular importance for the pattern of the radiation",
    "is the ( comoving ) distance sound can have influenced by recombination ( at redshift @xmath77 ) , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the photon density , @xmath80 for 3 species of massless neutrinos and @xmath81 .",
    "the angular diameter distance relation , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the comoving distance to recombination , @xmath84 is the curvature scale and the 3 cases are for negative , zero and positive mean curvature , adds dependence upon @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath9 as well as on @xmath87 .",
    "the location of the first acoustic peak @xmath88 is proportional to the ratio of @xmath89 to @xmath90 , hence depends upon @xmath72 through the sound speed as well .",
    "thus @xmath88 defines a functional relationship among these parameters , a _ degeneracy",
    "_ @xcite that would be exact except for the integrated sachs - wolfe effect , associated with the change of @xmath57 with time if @xmath8 or @xmath91 is nonzero .",
    "( if @xmath92 vanishes , the energy of photons coming into potential wells is the same as that coming out , and there is no net impact of the rippled light cone upon the observed @xmath42 . )",
    "our 7th parameter is an astrophysical one , the compton `` optical depth '' @xmath93 from a reionization redshift @xmath94 to the present .",

    ", we expect @xmath97",
    ". it is partly degenerate with @xmath27 and can not be determined at this precision by cmb data now .",
    "the lss also depends upon our parameter set : the most important combination is the wavenumber of the horizon when the energy density in relativistic particles equals the energy density in nonrelativistic particles : @xmath98 , where @xmath99 . instead of @xmath100 for the amplitude parameter",
