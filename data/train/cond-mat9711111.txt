    "<S> the meanfield interaction in a bose condensate provides a nonlinearity which can allow stable structures to exist in the meanfield wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a number of examples where condensates , modelled by the one dimensional gross pitaevskii equation , can produce gray solitons and we consider in detail the case of two identical condensates colliding in a harmonic trap . </S>",
    "<S> solitons are shown to form from dark interference fringes when the soliton structure , constrained in a defined manner , has lower energy than the interference fringe and an analytic expression is given for this condition .    </S>",
    "<S> epsf    [ fundamental structures in bose - einstein condensates ]    the experimental realisation of atomic gas bose einstein condensates has opened the door to the study of quantum phenomena on a mesoscopic scale , and a major interest is whether qualitatively new phenomena will occur . </S>",
    "<S> some of the most striking experimental results to date involve bulk dynamics of the condensate , and the jila and mit groups have made quantitative measurements of collective excitations @xcite , sound propagation @xcite and interaction between distinct condensates @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . a beautiful demonstration of quantum interference has been made by ketterle s group , where they allowed two distinct condensates ( in the same internal state ) to freely expand into each other to produce fringes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> careful analysis of this experiment @xcite has shown that the simple picture of linear interference does not adequately describe the results , and an additional mechanism , collisional self interaction , plays an important role in the formation of the fringe pattern . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we describe and analyse a noteworthy new phenomenon arising in condensates as a result of the self interaction , namely the formation of fundamental structures .    </S>",
    "<S> it is now well accepted that the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xmath0    provides a good description for the low temperature behaviour of a condensate in a single internal state . in this equation , </S>",
    "<S> ( in which dimensionless units are used as in ruprecht _  </S>",
    "<S> et al_@xcite ) , @xmath1 can be interpreted as the condensate wavefunction @xcite , @xmath2 is the trap potential , and @xmath3 is proportional to the number of atoms in the condensate and the scattering length . </S>",
    "<S> the self interaction is described by the final term of eq.([gpeq ] ) , introducing a nonlinearity into the description which , as is well known from other branches of physics , can profoundly alter the character of the system behaviour . a notable new feature that can appear is solitons @xcite , which are well known only in the one - dimensional case , but in the 2 or 3d case </S>",
    "<S> , analogous structures with inherent particle - like robustness , such as vortices , can also occur . </S>",
    "<S> even in the 1d case , no general results are known for the gp equation . </S>",
    "<S> morgan et al @xcite have shown the existence of solitary wave behaviour under some well defined conditions . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present a simple scenario in which colliding trapped condensates produce a particular class of fundamental structure , gray solitons . </S>",
    "<S> these topological solitons appear as a density dip with an associated phase kink , and reinhardt and clark @xcitehave discussed how the gray solitons resulting from such collisions might be used to establish the initial phase of the two condensates . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the mechanism of formation of the gray solitons . using numerical solutions of eq.([gpeq ] ) in one dimension </S>",
    "<S> , we have explored the phenomenon of gray soliton formation and identified the key mechanisms , thereby allowing us to develop an analytic description to provide quantitative understanding . the 1d case , although a considerable simplication over the more realistic 2d or 3d cases , nevertheless captures some essential characteristics including the coupling between nonlinearity and spatial variation , and we expect it will provide guidance for eventual extension into 2 or 3 spatial dimensions .     </S>",
    "<S> we have found that gray solitons can be produced by a variety of means , but for this paper we have chosen to study in detail the simplest scenario that enables us to identify and understand the key mechanisms involved , namely the case of two separated condensates colliding under the influence of a harmonic trap . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar in spirit to the interference experiment of ketterle s group , but has some distinctive features which are important for the analysis we give . as morgan et al @xcite </S>",
    "<S> have shown , a spatially displaced ground state eigenstate of the time independent gp equation , evolving alone in the trap , retains its shape while executing simple harmonic motion with period @xmath4 in the present units . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial phase profile is then always linear in the spatial variable @xmath5 , with a slope proportional to the velocity of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> thus by choosing an initial state consisting of two ground state eigenstates of equal particle number , displaced equal and opposite amounts from the center of the trap , equal to twice that of each eigenstate . ] we can easily isolate the phenomena that arises due solely to the collisions .    from an extensive set of simulations , in which we varied the value of @xmath3 , the initial separation , and the phase difference between the two condensates , we have found that we can divide the results into two broad regimes . in the first , which we call the _ linear regime _ , the total wavefunction @xmath6 can be very well approximated at any time @xmath7 during the first few periods of oscillation , by linearly superposing the wavefunctions that each condensate alone would have at @xmath8 the condensates , initially well separated , evolve to overlap at the centre of the trap producing a familiar linear fringe pattern , then separate to reconstitute themselves into two well separated condensates , regaining their original shape . </S>",
    "<S> the fringe spacing at any time during the overlap is determined from the @xmath9 vector ( i.e slope of the spatial phase ) that the condensates would have at that time , if oscillating alone in the trap . </S>",
    "<S> the linear regime occurs when the kinetic energy of the condensates during collision dominates the nonlinear self energy , a condition that requires the condensates to be initially well separated . </S>",
    "<S> an approximate quantitative criteria for the linear regime can be found by considering the linear interference pattern that the two condensates would produce at the time of maximum overlap ( @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 ... ) . </S>",
    "<S> for an initial separation of the centres of the condensates of @xmath13 , then the speed of each condensate at @xmath10 @xmath14 is @xmath15 , ( in the present units ) , giving rise to a fringe spacing of @xmath16 approximating the separate wavefunctions by thomas - fermi wavefunctions ( e.g @xcite ) the condition that the peak kinetic energy ( estimated from the curvature of a @xmath17 interference pattern ) exceeds the peak self energy ( i.e. at the centre of the fringes ) , and hence that the collisional behaviour is linear , takes the form    @xmath18    when eq.([cond ] ) is not satisfied , the collisional behaviour falls into the _ nonlinear regime _ , and a representative example </S>",
    "<S> is given in figure 1 , where the total condensate density is shown evolving over two periods of oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the behaviour is not simple linear superposition . </S>",
    "<S> the initial condensates do not reform at the periodic intervals @xmath19 .. , but rather , the combined condensate pulsates , contracting and expanding with period @xmath20 and gradually accumulates at the centre of the trap as time progresses . </S>",
    "<S> the most striking feature however is the appearance of several persistent dark fringes , each with an associated phase kink of somewhat less than @xmath21 these dark fringes remain clearly discernible throughout the course of the simulation , surviving the extremely complex behaviour that occurs at the time of maximum contraction ( @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 ... ) . </S>",
    "<S> we identify them with gray solitons , although these have only been fully characterised in the case of an infinitely extended medium in a homogeneous environment(e.g . </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite ) .    in that case </S>",
    "<S> , they can be described analytically , and an example is shown as the solid line in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the depth of the dip characterises the grayness of the soliton , which is said to be black ( or dark ) if the wave density goes to zero . </S>",
    "<S> the phase ( fig2(b ) ) has a corresponding kink in the region of the density dip , which is a sharp @xmath22 step for a black soliton , but softens as the soliton becomes gray , thereby giving the gray soliton a velocity relative to the background density . </S>",
    "<S> all of these properties are possessed by the six dark fringes in fig1 ( c)-(f ) , and evolve adiabatically as the background height changes . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that the fringes are very long lived ( they are still present when our simulation is extended to @xmath23 ) and in other circumstances we have shown that they have a repulsive interaction and survive collisions with each other . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of the solitons is vitally dependent on the phase kink , without which any dip quickly evolves to something quite different . </S>",
    "<S> the phase kink also provides a vital key to understanding the formation mechanism of these prototypical fundamental structures . </S>",
    "<S> the formation process begins when an essentially linear interference pattern starts forming where the two initial condensates overlap at the centre of the trap . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude is small , so that nonlinear effects are negligible , and thus the spacing of these first few fringes is determined by the wavevectors ( i.e. velocity ) that each condensate has developed at that time . </S>",
    "<S> fringes offset from the trap centre arise from the linear superposition of unequal amplitude opposing travelling waves , and thus have reduced visibility , and an associated phase kink ( see figure 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as time progresses , the condensates continue to accelerate into each other , and as the overlap increases , additional fringes start to develop further from the center . </S>",
    "<S> the central few fringes evolve as local features , and remain ( essentially ) locked in place , retaining their initial spacing while the background density increases about them , but the new outer fringes are formed with closer spacing , appropriate to the increased velocity . as we can see from fig 1 ( b ) , by @xmath24 ( which would correspond to complete overlap in the linear case ) a multitude of interference fringes have formed , and the wider spacing of the central fringes is evident . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently only the central few develop into gray solitons . </S>",
    "<S> the key underlying physics is that a soliton is a stable structure while a ( linear ) interference fringe is not , but an interference fringe will only develop into a gray soliton if it is energetically favorable to do so . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the interference fringe will disappear on a time scale less than @xmath25 to obtain a quantitative understanding we consider the energy of the two structures . </S>",
    "<S> a linear superposition of unequal and oppositely travelling waves of wavevector @xmath26 gives rise to a @xmath17 shape which can be characterised by the height @xmath27 and @xmath28 of the maximum and minimum density , respectively , as illustrated by the dotted line in fig 2(a ) ( dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy of this wave , in the length @xmath29 between fringe peaks is    @xmath30    in general a gray soliton is completely specified by two parameters , but if we now deform this same amount of condensate from the superposition , into a gray soliton within the same region @xmath31 , the constraint on @xmath32 allows a one parameter family of solitons to be inserted in the region . </S>",
    "<S> this one parameter essentially determines how much of the central portion of a soliton will appear in the region , and so if we further require that the soliton has reached a specified fraction of its asymptotic value at @xmath33 , then only one soliton can be drawn . from the standard form of the gray soliton ( e.g see ref.(@xcite ) ) the asymptotic behaviour </S>",
    "<S> is determined by @xmath34 at large @xmath35 , ( where @xmath36is essentially the spatial coordinate , but renormalised in our case by a function of the parameters @xmath37 ) . choosing a particular value @xmath38 to make @xmath39 @xmath40 some fraction close to 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we may calculate the energy of this now completely specified soliton to be    @xmath41    for example choosing @xmath42 gives the soliton whose density and phase we show as solid lines in fig 2(a ) and 2(b ) respectively . a stable structure </S>",
    "<S> , the soliton , will form from the linear superposition when it is energetically favorable to do so , i.e. when @xmath43 writing @xmath44 for the visibility of the superposition ( i.e. @xmath45 ) the condition of equality @xmath46 , which defines the boundary of the regime where solitons can form , can be expressed as    @xmath47 .   </S>",
    "<S> \\label{solcond}\\ ] ]    we have plotted the curve of @xmath27 versus @xmath44 in figure 3 for two values of @xmath48 with illustrative values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    a superposition formed above this boundary line will become a soliton , whereas a superposition formed below the line will not convert into the stable form . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath51 are simply overall multiplicative factors in eq.([solcond ] ) and thus move the boundary line up or down without change in shape . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that increasing the strength of the nonlinearity ( i.e. increasing @xmath52 or reducing the speed of condensates at collision ( i.e increasing @xmath53 makes it easier for solitons to form . </S>",
    "<S> the choice of @xmath38 is important for quantitative purposes , and on empirical grounds , from considering a range of our simulations , we make the choice @xmath54 from figure 3 we can then see that the central few fringes of fig 2(b ) , ( where @xmath55 ) are comfortably in the soliton regime , but as we move to the outer , narrower fringes of the condensate , @xmath51 decreases , moving the boundary curve upwards , and @xmath27 decreases , with the net result that solitons do not form .    the outcome of a condensate collision , particularly with regard to details of the solitons that arise , does exhibit some sensitivity to the initial phase difference of the condensates , as also noted by reinhardt and clark . for example , if the condensates have an initial phase difference of @xmath56 an odd number of solitons form , with a dark soliton at the centre of the pattern , a result easily understood in terms of the formation mechanism outlined above . </S>",
    "<S> there are of course other means to generate dark solitons , such as collision with a potential barrier , or even by creating a dip in a condensate eigenstate ( for example by temporarily inserting a laser beam , detuned to provide a repulsive potential ) . in general the dip </S>",
    "<S> will not have the soliton shape or phase , and is thus unstable and will decompose into a number of gray solitons which will have a velocity relative to the background , according to the slope of their phase kink .    </S>",
    "<S> gray solitons can also play an important role in governing the bulk motion of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> they store energy ( predominantly in kinetic form ) in a slow moving structure , and act as a throttle to retard the movement of the condensate back to the outer region of the trap . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be clearly seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(e ) , where instead of having two well separated condensates away from the centre , as we would expect in the linear case at @xmath57 most of the mass has now collected at the center of the trap . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that solitons , ( or vortices in the case of 2 or 3 spatial dimensions ) will play an important role in dissipating superfluid flow .    </S>",
