    "the statistical hadronization model ( shm ) is known to successfully describe hadron yields in a variety of experiments at different energies  @xcite .",
    "recently , new results on the yields of strange and multi - strange hadrons at @xmath0 have been published  @xcite .",
    "this data together with previously published non - strange particle yields  @xcite and @xmath1 meson measurement  @xcite provides a new opportunity to reevaluate hadronization conditions in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "heavier multistrange particles are more rarely produced and therefore to assure that statistical errors are small , they are often presented in wider centrality bins than non - strange particles . in order to study all particle yields as a function of centrality",
    ", we have to account for the different centrality binning .",
    "we associate each bin with average number of participants @xmath3 .",
    "then , we fit hadron yield as a function of @xmath3 using a power law , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are free parameters fitted and shown in table [ tab : params ] .",
    "we see as expected that particles are always more numerous than their respective anti - particles .",
    "however for the @xmath7 , we had only three data points and three free parameters of the interpolating function from eq.([eq : interpol ] ) .",
    "therefore , we fixed @xmath8 and fitted the other two . this fit , with on degree of freedom , gave us a qualitatively similar function as for the other particles .",
    ".[tab : params ] particle yields power fit parameters ( as defined by eq.([eq : interpol ] ) ) used to describe particle yields as function of centrality . for @xmath7 ,",
    "c=0 is assumed [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we performed a cross check of share  @xcite , the thermal model implementation we used , with three other codes currently in use by other groups using the compiled data in  @xcite .",
    "we tested our model on the data set from au ",
    "au collision at @xmath9 from star and obtained both yields and thermal parameters within 5% from the values in  @xcite .    rather than hadron ratios studied in  @xcite",
    ", we decided to fit hadron yields , which require a common volume @xmath10 of the source .",
    "we complemented the data set with identified hadrons ( @xmath11 ) from  @xcite and @xmath1 yield from  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we require the conservation of charge per baryon @xmath12 and strangeness @xmath13 with a few percent error to account for the detector acceptance and efficiency .    as was also pointed out in  @xcite ,",
    "the experimental particle yields are subject to an important inconsistency : for all centralities , the yield of @xmath14 is smaller than both @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( lowest of three corresponding lines in the left panel of the figure [ fig : tempgams ] ) . in general , at finite baryon density , we expect k@xmath17k@xmath18k@xmath19 .",
    "interestingly the missing @xmath14 are associated with yields of @xmath20 in that these three particle types had the largest contributions to the total @xmath21 of the fit . the choice to include or exclude them from the fit did not change the values of the shm parameters we obtained .",
    "it is interesting to note that the three neutral particle types have the same v - type charged particle decay and that there is an overlap in kinematic i d of the decay channels .",
    "for this reason we fitted instead the yield of @xmath22 which does not have this ambiguity .",
    "considering the smallness of the required shift from more numerous @xmath14 to @xmath23 we also fitted the ratio @xmath24 .",
    "these two data points replace the three raw yields and proved to be consistent with all other particle yields . assuming that other particles fix the source volume",
    ", this procedure incurs minimal loss of data information .",
    "we expected that our shm fit with @xmath25 should reproduce results of  @xcite . and indeed , we obtain compatible chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath26 ( top right panel of figure  [ fig : tempgams ] ) .",
    "however , we find that the strangeness phase space is strongly overpopulated , which is reflected by @xmath27 ( bottom right panel of figure  [ fig : tempgams ] ) contrary to results published by star .",
    "after we found this discrepancy , we learned from the authors that in @xcite @xmath28 has been forced .",
    "this of course completely invalidates the conclusions of this work .",
    "this also resolves the myth that the yields of @xmath29 are inconsistent with shm .    as a next step , we considered the chemical non - equilibrium with @xmath30",
    "this approach allows that aside of the strangeness phase space also the light @xmath31 quark phase space when observed on hadron side to be out of equilibrium . to preserve the number of degrees of freedom , we fitted the pressure @xmath32 , which is the value of critical hadronization pressure found in shm fits to other experiments  @xcite .",
    "the chemical non - equilibrium shm fit results in an even more pronounced strangeness yield enhancement , @xmath33 at central rapidity , an over - population of the light quark phase space @xmath34 , and a lower freeze - out temperature @xmath35 .",
    "another important feature of this approach is that the parameter errors in the fit decreased dramatically compared to the semi - equilibrium model . in the right bottom panel of figure",
    "[ fig : tempgams ] , the centrality dependence of these parameters is shown and the errors on @xmath36 and @xmath37 for chemical non - equilibrium are within the size of the symbols .",
    "we note that the shm fits at all centralities have confidence level above 60% .",
    "in the non - equilibrium shm approach there appears to be universal hadronization condition as function of centrality , which can be seen in figure  [ fig : phys1 ] top two panels on left .",
    "apart from the constant pressure @xmath38 , obtained at other rhic energies  @xcite , which value was used in non - equilibrium fits and found consistent with the new data , the entropy density at hadronization stays at constant universal value @xmath39 .",
    "similarly , the energy density is constant at @xmath40 .",
    "a universal value of statistical properties at hadronization as function of centrality  @xcite supports the notion of a new phase of matter , the quark ",
    "gluon plasma undergoing a sudden break up transition to hadrons which free stream , as the chemical non - equilibrium model assumes . on the other hand , in the semi - equilibrium hadronization model",
    ", both entropy and energy density grow nearly proportional to the number of participants .",
    "there is no physical understanding of this behavior .",
    "we see , in the bottom panel on left in figure  [ fig : phys1 ] , that in shm non - equilibrium fit , the ratio of strangeness @xmath41 to entropy @xmath42 approaches for most central collisions the qgp expectation @xmath43 .",
    "the relative yield of strangeness is systematically smaller in the shm semi - equilibrium fit . on right in figure",
    "[ fig : phys1 ] , we see at the top that strangeness density increases with centrality , in agreement with the expectation that the largest system can approach the qgp yield .",
    "moreover , we see that in the shm non - equilibrium model , we always find a much greater strangeness yield compared to the shm semi - equilibrium .",
    "the effect is quite large at small centrality , where the entropy contents differ most , see the left top panel .",
    "another interesting result in non - equilibrium shm is the constancy for @xmath44 of hadronization energy per baryon @xmath45 seen in bottom right of figure  [ fig : phys1 ] .",
    "moreover , we find that the fraction of the available energy in the collision is universal among other systems and collision energies .",
    "we find , @xmath46 .",
    "this result is the same as at the lower sps energies .",
    "it says that the stopping of baryon number is 4 times more effective than the stopping of energy . only at small centralities",
    "the stopping of energy and baryon number seems to converge to a common value resulting in @xmath47 .",
    "we revisited the statistical hadronization fit of particle yields from au ",
    "au collisions at @xmath0 recently updated with the yields of multi - strange hadrons .",
    "we obtained qualitatively different fit from the one published by the star collaboration  @xcite which was done with the constraints @xmath48 and @xmath28 and which fails to resolve yields of all multistrange particles .",
    "our results show a very good confidence level at all centralities .",
    "our results show that the hadron strangeness phase space is overpopulated @xmath49 from semi - central @xmath50 to most central collisions @xmath51 .",
    "we allowed the light quark phase space , @xmath52 , to be out of equilibrium as well and the new fit to the experimental data works for multistrange hadrons and has much smaller errors .",
    "however , given that @xmath53 were inconsistent with the yields of charged hadrons , we did fit @xmath54 .",
    "we found that the non - equilibrium model provides physical consistency in that as a function of centrality , i.e. , system size we find appropriate and universal behavior of bulk physical properties : entropy , energy , strangeness and the stopped energy per baryon  @xcite .",
