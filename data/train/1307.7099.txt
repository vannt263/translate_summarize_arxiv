    "these data have not been included in the global parton analyses , since ( a ) strictly speaking the cross section is proportional to the generalised gluon pdf and not the usual diagonal pdf , and , ( b ) there are some problems in implementing the nlo coefficient function . ] corresponding to this process .    the first problem may be solved in the low @xmath2 region using the shuvaev transform @xcite , which facilitates the relation between the generalised and diagonal pdfs to an accuracy of @xmath16 .",
    "coming to the second problem , we approximate the nlo corrections to the coefficient function by accounting for the explicit @xmath17 integration in the last step of the interaction .",
    "this is not the complete nlo contribution , but in this way we are able to include the most important nlo effect .",
    "the corresponding analysis was performed in 2008 , and described in detail in @xcite .",
    "however new and more precise data have been published by the hera experiment h1 @xcite , and in addition the lhcb collaboration have recently presented data on exclusive ( ultraperipheral ) @xmath0 production @xcite which is sensitive to , and enlarges , the low @xmath2 interval .",
    "these @xmath18 data enable us to improve the determination of the gluon , but require an extension of the theoretical framework and necessitate the inclusion of absorptive corrections .",

    "thus it becomes possible , in principle , to extract the gluon density @xmath44 directly from the measured diffractive @xmath19 cross section .",
    "however , first , let us list the corrections to the leading order expression . expression ( [ eq : lo ] ) is a simple first approximation , justified in the leading order ( lo ) collinear approximation using the non - relativistic @xmath19 wave function .",
    "it was shown by hoodbhoy  @xcite that the relativistic corrections to ( [ eq : lo ] ) , written in terms of the experimentally measured @xmath22 , are small , @xmath45 , and we neglect them .    we also need to account for the fact that the two exchanged gluons carry different fractions @xmath46 of the light - cone proton momentum , see fig .",
    "[ fig : feyndiagram ] .",
    "that is , we have to use the generalised ( skewed ) gluon distribution . in our case @xmath47 , and the skewing effect can be well estimated from  @xcite  the amplitude should be multiplied by @xmath48 where @xmath49/\\partial\\ln ( 1/x)$ ] ( for a more detailed discussion see @xcite ) . in other words , in the small @xmath2 region of interest , we take the gluon to have the form @xmath50 , where @xmath51 may be scale dependent .",

    "numerically the correction from the inclusion of the sudakov factor is negligible .",

    "the inclusion of the @xmath69 factor may be considered as an @xmath70 correction to the gluon density ; it affects the gluon in our analysis only marginally .",

    "in this section we consider the process @xmath86 . at the moment the lhc experiments are unable to tag forward protons accompanying the @xmath0 . instead the exclusivity is provided by selecting events with large rapidity gaps on both sides of the @xmath0 and fitting the @xmath87 distribution of the @xmath0 with two components : one with a small @xmath87 and one with a large @xmath87 .",
    "it is assumed that the small @xmath87 component corresponds to the exclusive process @xcite .",

    "the vertical lines represent two - gluon exchange .",

    "thus such data allow a probe of very low @xmath2 values , @xmath91 ; recall that for two - gluon exchange we have @xmath92.,height=377 ]    for exclusive @xmath0 production in @xmath93 collisions we have to include absorptive corrections . for production at hera ,",
    "the absorptive corrections are expected to be smaller .",
    "the transverse size , @xmath94 , of the @xmath95 dipole produced by the ` heavy ' photon in deep inelastic scattering has a logarithmic distribution @xmath96 starting from @xmath97 up to some hadronic scale . in the case of @xmath0 production the size of the @xmath30 dipole",
    "is limited by the size of the @xmath0 meson . even in photoproduction",
    "it is of the order of @xmath98 .",
    "since the probability of rescattering is proportional to @xmath99 , we anticipate a much smaller absorptive effect .    on the contrary , at the lhc , there is a probability of an additional soft interaction between the two colliding protons which will generate secondaries that will populate the rapidity gaps used to select an exclusive event .",
    "therefore , to include the lhcb @xmath0 data in the fit , we must first allow for the gap survival effect .",
    "these absorptive corrections are calculated using an eikonal model .",
    "it is convenient to work in the impact parameter ( @xmath100 ) representation , where the suppression factor for the cross section is s^2  =  s^2(b_t )  =  , [ eq : supfacb ] with @xmath101 the diffractive amplitudes in impact parameter space and @xmath102 the proton opacities , see  @xcite for details .    in order to extract the @xmath103 cross section ,",
    "the lhcb collaboration have used the absorptive factors calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite based on a one - channel eikonal model .",
    "the corresponding suppression factor is not strong ( typically @xmath104 ) since photon exchange mainly occurs at relatively large values of @xmath100 , where the proton opacity @xmath105 is already small .",
    "indeed , the photon flux @xmath106 is given by the integral over the photon @xmath107 which has a logarithmic form ,  = _ 0^q^2_t ,   where  t_min , [ eq : photonspectrum ] with @xmath108 and @xmath109 the momentum fraction of the emitting proton carried by the photon .",
    "in the integral @xmath110 effectively runs from @xmath111 to @xmath112 , where @xmath33 is the proton radius . at the upper end , the integral is limited by the proton form factor , @xmath113 . at the lower end of integration , with lhc kinematics ,",
    "the value of @xmath111 is quite small ; the corresponding photon momentum fractions @xmath114 are x_^  =  e^y ,   giving  t_mine^2y , [ eq : tmin ] where @xmath90 is the rapidity of the @xmath0 .",
    "thus the typical @xmath100 values are quite large , of the order of @xmath115 .",
    "only the upper end of the @xmath107 integral , where @xmath116 , is affected by absorptive corrections .    a deficiency of the lhcb extraction of the @xmath117",
    "cross section from their data is that the same survival factor , @xmath118 , was used for both diagrams of fig . [ fig:2diag](a ) and ( b ) , whereas , at non - zero rapidity , @xmath90 , the value of @xmath111 , and the corresponding value of @xmath100 , are quite different for large ( @xmath119 ) and small ( @xmath120 ) photon - proton centre - of - mass energies squared .    in the present analysis we fit to lhcb measurements of @xmath121 using the proton form factor given by f_p(q_t^2 )  =  ( 1+)^-2 , [ eq : fp ] and survival factors calculated from a two - channel eikonal model @xcite .",
    "this model had been previously obtained by fitting to the totem data @xcite for elastic @xmath93 scattering , @xmath122 , and to the totem estimate for low - mass diffractive dissociation at 7 tev , as well as the atlas data for @xmath123 which constrain high - mass diffractive dissociation .",
    "thus , in our calculation of @xmath124 , we include both diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) , each with their corresponding absorptive corrections .",
    "we account for the transverse polarisation of the @xmath0 in the @xmath125 amplitude , @xmath126 , as described in @xcite .",
    "the vector structure of the amplitude is important since it leads to the vanishing of the amplitude @xmath127 in the centre of the impact parameter space ( @xmath128 ) , precisely in the region where the suppression ( [ eq : supfacb ] ) is especially strong .    for completeness , we list , in tables [ tab : a2 ] and [ tab : a3 ] respectively , the survival factors relevant to exclusive @xmath0 and @xmath7 production at lhcb .",
    "the rapidity range covered by atlas and cms corresponds to a smaller @xmath129 .",
    "therefore the energies @xmath130 probed by these experiments are similar to that of hera .",
    "contrary to the @xmath93 case , in heavy ion ( pb - pb ) collisions the dominant contribution comes from the @xmath131 amplitude since for the @xmath88 component the value of @xmath111 ( [ eq : tmin ] ) is relatively large .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath132  tev and @xmath133 we have @xmath134 , while for pb - pb we need a large impact parameter @xmath135  fm in order not to destroy the nuclei ( of radius @xmath136 ) .",
    "therefore , for exclusive @xmath0 production in heavy ion collisions , the effective @xmath137 energy is not that large and comparable to the @xmath138 energies at hera .",
    "thus , with @xmath0 photoproduction in ultra - peripheral pb - pb collisions at @xmath139  tev  @xcite , we may study the nuclear modification effects on the gluon pdf but not so much its behaviour at very low @xmath2 .    in the case of pb-@xmath140 collisions",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the amplitude where the pb emits the photon . for pb , the photon flux in the cross section",
    "has a strong @xmath141 enhancement , not noticeably suppressed by the steep pb form factor as the main contribution comes from very small @xmath110 .",
    "conversely , due to strong screening effects and a form factor suppression , the cross section from two gluon exchange grows at large @xmath126 only @xmath142 . as a consequence , studies of pb-@xmath140 ( or @xmath140-pb ) collisions could provide data with a much suppressed @xmath131 contribution , leading to a more direct extraction of the small @xmath2 gluon . at lhcb",
    ", the different beam orientations of pb-@xmath140 and @xmath140-pb will effectively provide a probe of the @xmath88 and the @xmath131 contributions , respectively .",
    "our analysis includes not only the hera photoproduction data but also electroproduction data at larger values of @xmath143 .",
    "therefore we have to take into account the scale dependence of the gluon pdf . besides , we need the scale dependence in order to compute the unintegrated gluon distribution , @xmath57 , of eq .",
