    "the problem of calculating the coefficients in the taylor expansion of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath15 , is important in three and four loop calculations , and has a history spanning approximately twenty - five years ( to which we refer to @xcite for an account ) . in particular",
    ", it had been conjectured for a long time that every coefficient is a rational linear combination of multiple zeta values .",
    "this question was finally settled in the affirmative in @xcite , using mellin - barnes techniques .    until now , however , there seemed to be a lack of systematic methods for computing a range of feynman integrals analytically at higher loop orders . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new method , using iterated integration with polylogarithms , which was initiated in @xcite to compute the periods of moduli spaces of curves of genus 0 . using this",

    "although the five non - planar graphs all have genus 1 ( they can be drawn on a torus without any self - crossings ) , it turns out that the invariant which succesfully predicts the outcome of our method for computing the periods at six loops is not the genus but the crossing number .",
    "the crossing number of a graph @xmath0 is defined to be the minimial number of self - crossings over all planar representations of @xmath0 ( which are allowed to have curved edges ) .",

    "the one remaining primitive graph is the complete bipartite graph @xmath2 , and has crossing number exactly 2 , pictured in figure 8 .",
    "our method failed for this graph .",
    "= 12.0 cm [ figure2 ]    = 12.0 cm [ figure2 ]    = 3.0 cm [ figure2 ]      in summary , we found that for all feynman graphs up to 6 loops , those with crossing number 0 evaluate to multiple zeta values , and those with crossing number 1 give multiple polylogarithms evaluated at @xmath1 roots of unity .",
    "there is a single example of a graph ( @xmath2 ) with crossing number 2 , and our method fails in this case . the leading term in the taylor expansion of @xmath43 for @xmath2 is actually known to evaluate to a multiple zeta value , namely @xmath66 , which , interestingly , is the first occurrence of an irreducible double sum in @xmath67 theory .",
    "one possible reason for this is that our method concerns all terms in the taylor expansion of the integral @xmath43 , with arbitrary powers of logarithms in the numerator . in the particular case when there are no logarithmic terms in the numerator , the set of singularities of the integrand are slightly reduced , and it is not impossible that our method might work for @xmath2 with this restriction , although we have not checked this .",
    "another possible reason for this could be because our algorithm has some room for improvement , in at least two ways .",
    "first , the algorithm involves the repeated factorization of polynomials derived from the graph polynomial . in our computations , we only considered factorizations that occured over the field of rationals @xmath53 , although it is conceivable that some of the polynomials which occur are irreducible over @xmath53 , but factorize over an algebraic extension of @xmath53",
    ".    a second , and more promising , possibility is to extend our algorithm to deal with quadratic terms , and this will be explained in further detail in @xmath68 it is possible , by extending our method in this way , that a larger class of graphs will become tractable .",
    "however , it is more likely than not that eventually one will find periods of motives which are not mixed tate ( _ c.f . _",
    "@xcite ) , and this will pose a genuine obstruction to the present method . we expect that our method of polylogarithmic integration should also help to exhibit the first example of such a period in massless @xmath6 , if and when it occurs",
    ". the idea would be to strip away from a candidate feynman integral terms which evaluate to multiple zeta values , until one is left with a totally irreducible period integral which is verifiably not of mixed tate type .",
    "thus , the eventual failure of our method should at the same time exhibit the first non - mzv - type period , when it occurs .",
    "the paper is divided into two halves .",
    "the first half (  2 - 4 ) gives an overview of our method , and can be read linearly , as a long introduction . in @xmath69",
    "we briefly recall how to rewrite the feynman integrals @xmath43 in schwinger - parametric form using graph polynomials . in @xmath70 , we outline the main idea of our method , and in @xmath71 , we translate this into an elementary reduction algorithm on graph polynomials . the main theorem @xmath72 in @xmath73 states a sufficient condition for a bpd graph @xmath0 to evaluate to multiple zeta values in its taylor expansion .",
    "the purpose of the second half is to give a complete worked example of our method , in the case of the wheel with three spokes . in particular , in  7 , we give a new proof of the well - known result that the leading term of @xmath43 is @xmath74 .",
    "this is , to our knowledge , the first time that such a computation has appeared in print using a parametric representation for the feynman integral .",
    "the purpose of section 5 is to provide sufficiently many details to understand the intricacies of the method in general , and section 6 provides worked examples of taking primitives and limits of polylogarithms in two variables , which are then applied directly in the @xmath74 computation .",
    "it is perhaps advisable , after having read @xmath75 , to refer directly to the example in @xmath76 , and then read @xmath77 and @xmath78 bearing the example in mind .",
    "+ the proofs of our results will be written up in full detail in @xcite , including a study of the underlying algebraic geometry , which is completely absent from this paper , and a generalization of the above results to some infinite families of graphs .",
    "much of the background on iterated integrals , and also our method of integration with polylogarithms , is explained in detail in @xcite in the case of moduli spaces of genus 0 curves . these may serve as a useful introduction to this paper , since there are many similarities with the integrals we study here , even though the geometry underlying higher loop feynman integrals is considerably more complex .",
    "i owe many thanks to john gracey and david broadhurst for explaining to me the problem of studying the three - loop contributions to the massless two - point function , and also to dirk kreimer for many helpful discussions . the list of primitive divergent graphs up to 7 loops was kindly given to me by karen yeats , and my interest in the subject owes much to the work of bloch , esnault and kreimer @xcite , and the encouragement of pierre cartier .",
    "this work was motivated by the fruitful workshop on perturbative approaches to quantum field theory at esi vienna , and was continued at the mpim during an ipde fellowship , and completed at the ihes .",

    "the _ graph polynomial _ of @xmath0 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath19 in variables @xmath80 indexed by the set of internal edges of @xmath0 .",

    "a genuine obstruction should occur at the degree 3 level , since one expects to find elliptic components in this case . in any case",
    ", by extending our method to deal with quadratic terms , a larger class of graphs may then become reducible , and amenable to computation .    finally , if one is interested only in the leading term of the taylor expansion of the graph @xmath43",
    ", then one can simplify the reduction algorithm .",
    "recall that , for the general integral ( with arbitrary logarithms in the numerator ) , we obtained at the second step , the set of singularities : @xmath325 } = \\{u^{(1)},u_1,v^{(1)},v_1,d\\}\\ .\\ ] ] notice that in @xmath185 , where the numerator has no logarithmic terms , not all pairs of singularities can occur .",
