    "<S> an improved measurement of @xmath0 for @xmath1 in a broad range of @xmath2 and centrality is presented . by combining @xmath0 with the @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , we provide new insights on jet - medium interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that current pqcd energy loss models can not describe the suppression of the @xmath1 as a function of the angle with respect to the reaction plane . </S>",
    "<S> our result could help to resolve the factor of 4 differences in the predicted transport coefficients among these models . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , it may suggest that non - perturbative effects associated with the strongly coupled qgp are important , and new theoretical developments are needed to fully understand the jet medium interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of @xmath1 anisotropy at phenix potentially serves three important goals for heavy - ion program at rhic : a ) to better constrain the energy loss processes by studying the suppression of @xmath1 as function of angle to the reaction plane ( rp ) ; b ) to investigate the mechanisms for anisotropy at intermediate @xmath2 , where the transition from a pressure gradient dependent outward - push driven by collective flow to a path length dependent attenuation driven by jet quenching takes place ; c ) to understand the non - flow contribution , especially those from jets , in the high @xmath2 @xmath0 measurements . </S>",
    "<S> these goals are motivated by the current limitation in our understanding of the interactions between jets and flowing medium . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the extraction of transport properties suffer from large theoretical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> predictions by various jet quenching frameworks differ by a factor of 4 , even though they all describe the @xmath3 measurements with identical 3-d hydro evolution of the underlying medium  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> precision measurements of rp dependent suppression can provide severe constraints on these models .    </S>",
    "<S> these goals are facilitated by the large increase in the effective statistics of the 2007 au+au dataset from phenix , which is the basis of current analysis . </S>",
    "<S> it has two important improvements over the previous phenix measurements  @xcite : 1 ) various new rp detectors were installed covering a broad @xmath4 range with improved resolution ( rxnpin , rxnpout , mpc at @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ) , and 2 ) factor of 4 increase in collected statistics relative to  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to an effective factor of 14 and 7 increase for @xmath1 @xmath0 measurement for rxnp and mpc , respectively . due to limited space </S>",
    "<S> , we shall focus our discussion on goal a ) and briefly mention goals b ) and c ) at relevant places .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis follows the same technique laid out in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea is to extract @xmath1 s from the invariant mass distribution constructed separately in six bins of @xmath1 angle relative to the event plane ( ep ) , @xmath8 , in the interval @xmath9 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the raw @xmath0 is obtained by fitting the raw yield with @xmath10 , which is then corrected by the corresponding reaction plane resolution , @xmath11 , to give the signal @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the ep is obtained via standard event plane method and @xmath11 is measured via the sub - event method by correlating the north and south rp detectors ( which are symmetric ) . </S>",
    "<S> the differential nuclear modification factor @xmath13 is calculated from the published angle - averaged @xmath14  @xcite as @xmath15    one advantage of the broad @xmath4 coverage for the rp detectors is that one can evaluate the potential non - flow effects . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the @xmath0 vs @xmath16 in a low @xmath2 region and a high @xmath2 region , measured by different rp detectors . there is a clear @xmath4 dependence of @xmath0 values at high @xmath2 , especially in the peripheral collisions </S>",
    "<S> this is not the case at low @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that most of the non - flow effects are induced by jets , and they only become important at high @xmath2 and for rp detectors reside closer to central arm where the @xmath1s are detected . </S>",
    "<S> even though rxnp detectors have the best resolution , they may suffer jet bias . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we use mpc for ep determination . </S>",
    "<S> the mpc sits at the same @xmath4 range as bbc detectors ( used in previous analysis ) ; however it has 40% better resolution compare to the bbc since it measures both neutral and charged particles , and has higher granularity .    </S>",
    "<S> lr     @xmath0 vs @xmath16 at a low @xmath2 and a high @xmath2 regions using different reaction plane detectors . ]    &    figure  [ fig:2 ] shows @xmath0 values measured in six centrality classes , overlaid with the published results from 2004 au+au run  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the two measurements are consistent , but new data improve significantly on both statistical errors and @xmath2 reach . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 at @xmath17 gev / c , for all centralities , remains significantly above zero and is constant with @xmath2 .     </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 @xmath0 vs @xmath2 in six centrality bins </S>",
    "<S> . the solid points are the phenix preliminary results in run 7 measured with the mpc detector . </S>",
    "<S> the open points are the published results from  @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> if the particle production at high @xmath2 ( @xmath18 gev / c ) is dominated by fragmentation of the jets that survive the medium , as most energy loss models predict , then it would lead to an anisotropy of the suppression which can be compared with our data . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the high @xmath2 @xmath3 for @xmath1 measured in - plane ( @xmath19 ) and out - of - plane ( @xmath20 ) directions , derived according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:1 ] . a clear split of the suppression levels can be seen between the two for three centrality bins shown ( 20 - 30% , 30 - 40% and 40 - 50% ) . </S>",
    "<S> calculations from three pqcd jet quenching models ( abbreviated as amy , ht , asw ) from  @xcite are compared with our data . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations are carried out with identical initial conditions , medium evolution and fragmentation functions , and their suppression levels have been tuned to reproduce the inclusive @xmath3 data in central au+au collisions as well as the 20 - 30% bin . however , as figure  [ fig:3]a shows , all three models under - predict the difference between in - plane and out - of - plane @xmath3 : the amy model describes the out - of - plane @xmath3 , but not the in - plane ; ht model is the opposite ; asw model does a reasonable job for both in- and out - of plane directions at high @xmath2 , but misses the low @xmath2 region . </S>",
    "<S> however , we are not advocating that one model is better than the other , because changing other control parameters , like initial conditions , medium evolution or fragmentation functions , may change this comparison . </S>",
    "<S> our principal conclusion is that by utilizing both observables , one should be able to narrow down the uncertainties on initial condition and medium evolution and other effects that were ignored so far in the calculation , e.g. virtuality difference between the in- and out - of plane . </S>",
    "<S> our data may help to resolve the discrepancies , e.g. @xmath21 , between the model predictions .     </S>",
    "<S> data points : solid(open ) is the in - plane(out - of - plane ) @xmath1 @xmath14 for three centrality bins measured with the mpc detector . </S>",
    "<S> lines represent calculations of amy , ht and asw models from  @xcite , respectively . ]    on the other hand , the failure of these models to reproduce the large anisotropy at high @xmath2 may imply that the pqcd treatment of the energy loss process as sequential radiation , being proportional to the local color change density is not sufficient . in the presence of the strongly coupled medium ( sqgp ) , both the path length dependence and the color charge dependence </S>",
    "<S> could be modified . </S>",
    "<S> for example , calculation based on ads / cft technique suggests that @xmath22  @xcite and @xmath23  @xcite instead of @xmath24 and @xmath25 for pqcd . in a separate calculation , kharzeev  @xcite estimates @xmath26 in strong coupling limit , much stronger than the logarithmic dependence expected from pqcd . </S>",
    "<S> these non - linear dependences could be the reason for the large anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:4 ] shows the comparison of @xmath0 with several toy model predictions with different medium density dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the model from  @xcite introduces strong non - linear dependence by assuming that jet quenching happens mostly close to phase transition boundary . the model from  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> does so by suppressing the energy loss at high energy density region by using a plasma formation time argument . </S>",
    "<S> both are able to qualitatively describe centrality dependence . however , much need to be done to generalize these toy models into rigorous theoretical calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> lr     data points : @xmath0 values at @xmath276gev/@xmath28 measured with the mpc detector . </S>",
    "<S> open symbols : pqcd model calculations taken from  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lines : geometric model calculationss with different assumptions on path length dependence  @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> &    in summary , we presented high statistics measurement of @xmath1 @xmath0 and @xmath29 up to 13 gev / c in broad centrality ranges of au+au collisions at @xmath30=200 gev . </S>",
    "<S> current energy loss models were not able to describe @xmath31 at @xmath17 gev / c . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy implies that the current pqcd models need further tuning , in which case our measurement can help to resolve the differences in these models . </S>",
    "<S> it may also suggest that the non - perturbative effects associated with the strongly coupled qgp are important , and new tools are required to understand the energy loss processes . </S>",
    "<S> further detailed study of the @xmath0 and @xmath3 in the intermediate @xmath2 range of 2 - 6 gev / c may shed light on the role of perturbative and non - perturbative effects . </S>"
