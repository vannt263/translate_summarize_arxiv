    "the discovery of multiple exotic charmoniumlike ( and bottomoniumlike ) states in the past dozen years , starting with belle s observation  @xcite of the @xmath9 , has been nothing short of stunning .",
    "previously , the heavy quarkonium @xmath10 systems were the best understood sectors of hadronic physics , with spectra that could be completely predicted from two - body schrdinger equations , modeled using nonrelativistic potentials developed decades ago and continuously refined  @xcite .",
    "the observation of more than 20 such so - called @xmath11 bosonic states  @xcite ( several of which have been confirmed by multiple experiments ) has upended this previous simple picture .",
    "the latest finding in this regard is the lhcb observation  @xcite of two exotic baryonic charmoniumlike states , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , at high statistical significance in the @xmath12 spectrum of @xmath13 .",
    "these states , like the @xmath14 [ also called @xmath15 before them  @xcite , are shown to have rapid phase variation in their production amplitudes consistent with true resonant behavior .",
    "evidence continues to mount that at least some of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are genuine @xmath19 tetraquark states ( not just kinematical effects ) , while the @xmath4 are @xmath2 pentaquark states .",
    "of course , the possibility of qcd exotics has been noted in the earliest days of the quark model  @xcite , even before the advent of color dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , despite decades of scrutiny , no unambiguous experimental signal indicating the existence of an exotic hadron outside of the @xmath20-meson , @xmath21-baryon paradigm has ever been identified in the light - quark @xmath22 sector , or even in the sector with a single heavy quark .",
    "why should it be that exotics are first becoming visible in doubly heavy - quark systems ?",
    "one explanation lies in the embarrassment of hadronic riches in the @xmath23  gev range : many of the purported light - quark exotics have the same quantum numbers as conventional quark - model states and can hide amongst them , or indeed , mix with them quantum mechanically .",
    "even the extremely well - established @xmath24 @xmath9 might mix at some level with the yet - unseen conventional @xmath25 state @xmath26 ( as suggested numerous times , most recently in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    previous work by the present author  @xcite to explain this curious fact has argued that the key feature in forming an identifiable exotic state is the presence of two components in the hadron , each of which contains a heavy quark and is consequently fairly compact ( a few tenths of a fm ) , but that are separated from each other , in the sense of having a small wave function overlap , by a somewhat larger distance . the specific proposal in those works is the presence of compact colored diquark ( or triquark ) components separately bound together through the attractive @xmath27 color interaction and collectively bound together by confinement .",
    "however , the same situation arises in the molecular picture , in which the compact components are color - singlet heavy quark - containing meson and baryon pairs . in the former case ,",
    "the residual color interaction between the components is full - strength qcd , and in the latter it is the much weaker residual color van der waals qcd force .",
    "supposing that exotics have only recently become observable because they require well - separated components , each containing a heavy quark , one may reconsider analogous systems in which the @xmath25 or @xmath28 quark pairs are replaced by @xmath29 .",
    "this proposal is not at all guaranteed success , since the @xmath30 is not truly heavy ( _ i.e. _ , the current quark mass @xmath31 is smaller than @xmath32 ) , and it may well turn out that exotics of the type thus far seen absolutely require the presence of two heavy quarks . a major thrust of this work is to provide one test of this point of view : is the divide between the @xmath33 and @xmath30 quarks so great that _ no _ exotic behavior survives in the @xmath29 sector ? in order to do so , one may seek out effects perhaps not as prominent as in the heavy - quark systems since @xmath30 is not truly heavy , but anomalous nonetheless .",
    "this proposal was first advocated and applied to the case of @xmath34-@xmath35 photoproduction in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was used to explain the appearance in clas ( jlab ) data  @xcite of peculiar enhancements of the @xmath36 cross section in the @xmath34 forward and backward directions .",
    "it was argued that treating the process as a @xmath37 scattering resulting from the formation of a color - antitriplet @xmath38 diquark and a color - triplet @xmath39 $ ] antitriquark , which subsequently hadronize to @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] through the large - separation wave function tails of the hadrons stretching between the two compact colored components , provides a natural mechanism to explain forward and backward cross section enhancements . in this case , the anisotropic nature of the enhancements disfavors a resonant origin  @xcite , meaning that the @xmath38-@xmath39 $ ] complex is only a `` would - be '' pentaquark  @xcite .",
    "the original @xmath34 photoproduction study was suggested by the simple substitution of @xmath3 into the @xmath42 photoproduction proposals of refs .",
    "@xcite . in both @xmath34 and @xmath43 cases ,",
    "the @xmath10 pair arises through the dissociation of the incoming photon .",
    "no particular @xmath44 compositeness substructure ( diquark  @xcite or other colored substructure  @xcite , molecular  @xcite , observation , see refs .",
    "hadrocharmonium  @xcite , or soliton  @xcite ) is presupposed ; but if the states turn out to be kinematical effects  @xcite due to the particular placement of hadronic levels with respect to the original @xmath5 production process , then one would not necessarily expect interesting structure to arise in @xmath45 .",
    "a discussion of the relative merits of various interpretations for @xmath4 states appears in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "investigations have also begun into decays related to @xmath46 , such as via @xmath47 and @xmath48  @xcite , in a search for the flavor su(3 ) partners of the @xmath4 states . in each case , the underlying weak decay is @xmath49 or @xmath50 , meaning that the relevant cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element combination is @xmath51 or the even smaller combination @xmath52 .",
    "the possibility that the weak decay is actually @xmath53 is explored in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this short paper",
    "we propose to create the precise hidden - strangeness analogues @xmath54 to the @xmath4 states through the decay @xmath55 .",
    "the replacement of @xmath56 , specifically the substitution of the weak decay @xmath57 , is all that is needed to produce this channel from one already known .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps ] the flow of quark flavors in the process in terms of the diquark - triquark picture used for @xmath4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , as argued above , the diquark picture is not necessarily the only one that produces viable double - heavy pentaquark states , and the figure is intended merely as an illustration of one particular viable physical process .",
    "again , we emphasize that @xmath29-containing exotics , and the @xmath8 states in particular , are not guaranteed to exist ; the proposal here is that the underlying mechanism creating the @xmath4 states also holds for @xmath8 , and the sole dynamical input is the assumption that the gluodynamics leading to the energy differences involved is flavor independent .    a discussion of the merits and drawbacks of this and related modes is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : modes ] , followed by a brief summary in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .    )",
    "-antitriquark ( @xmath58 ) formation ] for the production of a pentaquark @xmath59 state in the decay @xmath60 .",
    "the black square indicates the @xmath33-quark weak decay .",
    "the spatially extended @xmath61 state is held together by long - range color forces ( indicated by gluon lines ) via a color flux tube . ]",
    "we begin with the analogy between the process @xmath62 and @xmath55 , the former illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite and the latter here in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps ] . just as for the corresponding @xmath4 production process in ref .",
    "@xcite , the presence of more than one copy of the light @xmath63 quark in the final state ( indeed , three @xmath63 s for @xmath64 compared to only two for @xmath65 ) offers the possibility of several production diagrams , regardless of the physical process . in the diquark picture ,",
    "it is natural to expect the @xmath63 in the diquark @xmath66 contained in the initial @xmath67 to maintain its identity throughout the process as a spectator .",
    "however , the @xmath63 appearing in the diquark @xmath68 can still emerge either from the weak decay @xmath69 or from the @xmath70 production .",
    "analogous statements apply to other physical decay pictures .",
    "replacing @xmath71 produces the isospin - partner process @xmath72 .",
    "the rate for this process should be comparable to that for @xmath8 , but not exactly equal ( even in the limit of perfect isospin ) , since the @xmath69 weak decay violates isospin , failing to produce a @xmath73 quark able to interfere with the ones from other sources .",
    "quark reemerges if one considers the weak decay @xmath74 , but such processes are not only ckm suppressed ( by a factor @xmath75 ) , but also may lack an @xmath30 quark in the final state . ] in any case , neutron reconstruction can be experimentally rather challenging , so the @xmath8 channel seems to be the most promising one for near - term investigations .    to be precise , if the mixing associated with the weak - decay @xmath63 quark is ignored , the processes @xmath76 and @xmath77 are entirely comparable if one substitutes @xmath78 and notes that @xmath79 and @xmath80 are su(3)-partnered pseudo - nambu",
    " goldstone bosons .",
    "only the @xmath81 in the @xmath80 flavor wave function is different .    noting that @xmath82-hadrons have lifetimes comparable to their charmed counterparts despite a much greater available phase space .",
    "conversely , the branching fractions for the corresponding charmed processes such as @xmath77 , or for that matter , nonresonant @xmath83 , are enhanced compared to their @xmath84 counterparts . a glance at the known branching fractions for @xmath85 decays  @xcite shows known three - body decays to occur in the several times @xmath86 range or even larger , indicating that , if nothing else , the discovery of the mode @xmath83 should be straightforward .",
    "the resonance @xmath8 content of the process is also expected to be nonnegligible . in the @xmath4 case , lhcb measured  @xcite the branching fraction ratios @xmath87 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , quite significant considering the large available @xmath88 phase space , suggesting that @xmath8 production in @xmath83 will not be uncommon .    arguably , the most interesting difference between @xmath88 @xmath89 and @xmath90 is simple phase space .",
    "since @xmath91 is so much greater than @xmath92 , a much greater phase space is available in the former process . to be specific , @xmath93 note first that the phase space for the @xmath85 decay is so small that no unflavored meson in the final state heavier than @xmath94 , and no unflavored baryon heavier than a nucleon , is possible . in the case of final - state decays to states in which the heavier quarks emerge in separate hadrons : @xmath95 which assumes that the mesons appearing in the @xmath96 resonance decays preferentially have @xmath97 like @xmath43 or @xmath34 , then the phase space is even smaller .",
    "obviously , if @xmath98 or @xmath99 final states can occur in the @xmath4 or @xmath8 decays , respectively ( which requires higher partial waves since the @xmath4 states have @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) , then the phase space is correspondingly larger . but",
    "the message is clear : if @xmath8 resonances are formed in the decay of @xmath85 , they do not have much available phase space .",
    "this effect is further magnified if one notes that the observed @xmath4 resonances lie well above the @xmath12 threshold , by about 415 and 345  mev for @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively . if similar numbers hold for the distance of the purported @xmath8 states from the @xmath104 threshold , which assumes a flavor independence of the mechanism depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps ] ( an extremely crude first approximation ) , then according to eqs .  ( [ eq : thresh1])([eq : thresh2 ] ) , the resonance peaks will not be visible in @xmath85 decays .",
    "indeed , the @xmath102 is sufficiently narrow ( @xmath105  mev ) that a corresponding @xmath8 resonance ( peak at 2372  mev ) would not be visible at all .",
    "however , the large width of @xmath103 ( @xmath106  mev ) suggests that an exact @xmath8 analogue ( peak at 2303  mev ) would begin to appear in the endpoint region .",
    "the topology of the event in the center - of - momentum ( c.m . ) frame of the @xmath85 in such a case would be remarkable : since this c.m .",
    "frame is the rest frame of not only the @xmath85 but almost that of the @xmath8 and @xmath80 as well , one would observe two photons of nearly equal energy from the @xmath80 decay emerge back - to - back , as well as a slowly moving proton recoiling against a nearly collinear @xmath107 pair from the @xmath34 decay .",
    "the higher - strangeness su(3 ) partners to the decay @xmath108 whose parent baryon decays weakly , namely @xmath109 and @xmath110 , tend to have even less phase space : about 13 and 62  mev , respectively .",
    "however , the decay @xmath111 has almost precisely the same phase space as @xmath112 : @xmath113 not only does the @xmath114 have a longer lifetime than @xmath85 ( @xmath115  ps , to be compared with @xmath116  ps or @xmath117  ps ) , it has a perhaps more easily reconstructed final state : a primary decay @xmath118 and a secondary decay @xmath119 .",
    "note that the channels with @xmath120 in the final state imply open - strangeness ( @xmath121 ) pentaquarks , which may be expected to lie above @xmath122 states in mass , and therefore potentially outside of range of the initial hadron phase space .",
    "it is also worth noting that the @xmath123 and @xmath124 contain diquarks of a somewhat different nature than the @xmath125 in a @xmath126 state , the former carrying nonzero isospin and the latter requiring proper antisymmetrization between the identical @xmath30 quarks .",
    "indeed , part of the motivation for this work ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ps ] ) was to treat the @xmath30 quarks as heavy , which becomes less compelling if @xmath30 quarks arise elsewhere in the process .",
    "the small available phase space remains the least appealing feature of this proposal .",
    "even so , several points are worth mentioning .",
    "first , the @xmath8 mass estimates may be unnecessarily high . since the observed @xmath4 states have the large spins @xmath127 and @xmath101 ( as well as one of them necessarily having negative parity ) , it is very likely that lighter yet - unobserved @xmath4 states exist , which implies lighter @xmath8 would be possible as well .",
    "indeed , no obvious physical principle requires the @xmath8 states to lie above the @xmath104 threshold as far as the corresponding @xmath4 states lie above the @xmath12 threshold .",
    "second , the large available phase space for @xmath4 decay was actually a substantial nuisance in the @xmath4 observation paper  @xcite , since multiple excited @xmath126 states had to be included in the analysis .",
    "with phase space as small as suggested above , potential higher states provide very little contamination .",
    "one may hope to avoid the phase - space problem , as well as reduce the ckm suppression , by considering not @xmath57 but @xmath128 , which increases the production rate of relevant processes by a factor of @xmath129 .",
    "however , the @xmath8 state still requires an @xmath130 quark , which must now appear through pair production .",
    "the final state then requires one to accommodate at least three strange quarks , creating insurmountable difficulties with phase space in charmed baryon decays . alternately , one may attempt to build states in the manner of fig .  [",
    "fig : ps ] without an @xmath130 quark in the antitriquark @xmath131 , but doing so violates the premise of exotics requiring a heavy quark in each component to be detectable .",
    "a search for the hidden - strangeness pentaquarks @xmath59 , siblings to the newly observed @xmath4 pentaquark candidates , appears to be well within current experimental capabilities .",
    "the main difficulty appears to be the limited phase space available in the decays of the likely charmed baryon sources , the best candidate being @xmath77 , which is the exact su(3)-flavor analogue to the channel @xmath4 discovery channel @xmath5 .",
    "the decay @xmath132 appears to be interesting both for the relative ease of its reconstruction and the possibility of finding hints of an open - strangeness @xmath133 pentaquark . at minimum",
    ", new unobserved decay modes are within reach , but with a bit of luck , more exciting hints of exotic hadron structure may be uncovered .",
