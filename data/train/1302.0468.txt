    "the study of hadron structure and the spectrum of hadron resonance is one of the most important issues in hadronic physics and is attracting much attention ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a general review ) . in past decades ,",
    "many excited states of baryon were observed and their properties have been measured  @xcite . for those nucleon resonances with mass below @xmath17 gev ,",
    "most of their parameters , such as mass , total decay width , decay modes , etc . , have been more or less studied both on experimental and theoretical sides .",
    "however , for the states around or above @xmath17 gev , our present knowledge on them is still in its infancy  @xcite .",
    "moreover there are still many theoretical predictions of `` missing @xmath18 states '' around @xmath17 gev , which have not so far been observed  @xcite .",
    "since more number of effective degree of freedoms will induce more predicted number of excited states , the `` missing @xmath18 states '' problem is in favor of the diquark configuration which has less degree of freedom and predicts less @xmath18 states  @xcite .",
    "so , studying the nucleon resonances around or above @xmath17 gev , not only on experimental side but also on theoretical side , is interesting and needed .",
    "the associated strangeness production reaction , @xmath19 , is interesting .",
    "firstly , this reaction requires the creation of an @xmath20 quark pair .",
    "thus , a thorough and dedicated study of strangeness production mechanism in this reaction has the potential to gain a deeper understanding of the interaction among strange hadrons and also on the nature of baryon resonances .",
    "secondly , it is a good channel to study the @xmath18 resonances around @xmath17 gev which have significant couplings to @xmath11 channel , because the @xmath11 is a pure isospin @xmath21 channel and the production threshold of @xmath11 is about @xmath17 gev ( @xmath22 gev ) .",
    "thirdly , the near threshold differential and total cross sections for kaon pair production in the @xmath23 reaction have been measured by disto collaboration  @xcite , cosy-11 collaboration  @xcite , and cosy - anke collaboration  @xcite .",
    "these results show clear evidence for the excitation and decay of @xmath24 meson sitting on a smooth @xmath25 background . for the non-@xmath24 kaon pair production ,",
    "the role of the low energy @xmath26 excited state , @xmath27 , have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite by using chiral unitary theory and in ref .",
    "@xcite within an unified approach using an effective lagrangian model .",
    "since the @xmath27 state lies below @xmath28 threshold , it is expected to give significant contribution at the energies near the reaction threshold . however ,",
    "at higher energies , the next @xmath26 excited state , @xmath0 , could be important for the non-@xmath24 kaon pair production in the @xmath29 reaction  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath19 reaction is also the basic input for the @xmath0 production in the proton - nucleus reactions  @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the contribution from a nucleon resonance with spin - parity @xmath30 and mass around @xmath31 gev was studied in the @xmath0 ( @xmath32 ) photo- or electro - production processes .",
    "they all found that this nucleon resonance has a significant coupling to @xmath11 channel and plays an important role in these reactions . before the year of 2012",
    ", this nucleon resonance was filed as a two - star nucleon resonance @xmath9 in the particle date group ( pdg ) review , which is now named as @xmath33  @xcite . even though , in order for convenience , here after , we still call it as @xmath9 .    in the present work",
    ", we study the role of @xmath9 resonance ( @xmath34 ) in the @xmath35 and @xmath3 reactions within the effective lagrangian method . since the information about @xmath9 resonance is scarce  @xcite and the knowledge of its properties , like mass , total decay width , branch ratios , are poor",
    ", we take its mass and total decay width as @xmath36 mev and @xmath37 mev , respectively , which are obtained by fitting them to the experimental data on the @xmath38 reaction in ref .  @xcite . for the @xmath39 coupling constant",
    ", we also take the value that was obtained in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "finally , from fitting to the experimental data of @xmath12 reaction , we can get the @xmath13 coupling constant , then we study the role of @xmath9 resonance in the @xmath40 reaction with the assumption that the production mechanism is due to the @xmath15-meson exchange",
    ".    it will be helpful to mention that though the effective lagrangian method is a convenient tool to catch the qualitative features of the reaction processes , it is not consistent with the unitary requirements , which in principle are important for extracting the parameters of the nucleon resonances from the analysis of the experimental data  @xcite , especially for those reactions involving many intermediate couple channels and three - particle final states  @xcite . in the present work , basing on phenomenological lagrangians , we only consider the tree - diagram contributions , in which the unitarity condition is not ensured and couple channel effects are not taken into account .",
    "however , our model can give a reasonable description of the experimental data in the considered energy region .",
    "meanwhile , our calculation offers some important clues for the mechanisms of the @xmath41 reaction and make a first effort to study the role of @xmath9 resonance in relevant reactions .    in the next section",
    ", we will give the formalism and ingredients in our calculation , then numerical results and discussions are given in sect .",
    "a short summary is given in the last section .",
    "the combination of effective lagrangian method and isobar model is an important theoretical approach in describing the various processes in resonance production region . in this section ,",
    "we introduce the theoretical formalism and ingredients to calculate the @xmath0 hadronic production in @xmath12 and @xmath35 reactions within the effective lagrangian method .      the basic tree level feynman diagrams for the @xmath12 and @xmath35 reactions are depicted in fig .",

    "since the hadrons are not point like particles , we ought to introduce the compositeness of the hadrons .",
    "this is usually achieved by including the relevant off shell form factors in the amplitudes .",

    "<S> we investigate the @xmath0 hadronic production in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 reactions within the effective lagrangian method . for @xmath3 reaction , in addition to the `` background '' contributions from @xmath4channel @xmath5 exchange , @xmath6channel @xmath7 exchange , and @xmath8channel nucleon pole terms , we also consider the contribution from the nucleon resonance @xmath9 ( spin - parity @xmath10 ) , which has significant coupling to @xmath11 channel . we show that the inclusion of the @xmath9 leads to a fairly good description of the low energy experimental total cross section data of @xmath12 reaction . from fitting to the experimental data </S>",
    "<S> , we get the @xmath13 coupling constant @xmath14 . by using this value and with the assumption that the excitation of @xmath9 is due to the @xmath15-meson exchanges , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the total and differential cross sections of @xmath16 reaction . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the invariant mass distribution and the dalitz plot provide direct information of the @xmath0 production , which can be tested by future experiments . </S>"
