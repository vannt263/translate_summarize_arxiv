    "formation of binary stars is a fascinating subject generating a very active research effort .",
    "separate conferences @xcite are devoted to this subject while specialized review papers @xcite describe difficulties in understanding of this complex process .",
    "binaries with orbital periods of the order of a hundred of days are usually considered as close in this context .",
    "we have no idea how short - period binaries with periods much shorter than 3 to 5 days form .",
    "in fact , such binaries , particularly those with periods shorter than one day , should not exist : indeed , even if some unknown process would form contact binaries at the t  tauri stage , relatively large sizes of component stars would imply the resulting orbital periods to be longer than about 3  5 days .",
    "formation in triple ( or multiple ) systems may alleviate the close - binary formation difficulty by allocating most of the angular momentum in the most distant component of a triple / multiple system , leaving a low angular momentum remnant . such a scenario would have important observational consequences because  by observing close binaries  we would preferentially select stars with distant companions .",
    "one particular mechanism involving the kozai cycles @xcite may produce close binaries by invoking a very strong tidal interaction during periastron passages when the inner , close ( low angular momentum ) orbit is perturbed by the third body into a very eccentric one .",
    "the close periastron interactions may then lead to a rapid angular momentum loss @xcite .",
    "a confirmation of the triple body formation of very close binaries can only come through observations and careful statistical investigations .",
    "unfortunately , proving or disapproving this hypothesis is difficult and  as for all statistical studies  is hindered by observational bias and selection effects . in this paper , we limit our scope to contact binaries , the most extreme objects with the lowest angular momentum content among all main sequence ( ms ) binary stars .",
    "contact binaries @xcite are made of solar - type stars with spectral types ranging from early k , through g and f to middle - a ; they have short orbital periods ranging between 0.22 day to about 0.7 day at which point the statistics becomes unreliable and properties of massive contact binaries less well defined .",
    "thus , in spite of the unquestioned existence of very massive contact binaries , it is not clear if a continuous sequence joins the solar - type contact binaries ( stars also known as w  uma type variables ) with the early - type b and o - type binaries . in this paper , we limit ourselves to binaries with periods shorter than 1 day which is the traditional period limit for the solar - type ( w  uma - type ) contact binaries .",
    "@xcite commented on a high incidence of visual binaries among contact binaries while discussing a visual binary consisting of two w  uma - type systems , bv  dra and bw  dra .",
    "later on , @xcite listed several cases of triple systems with contact binaries in his compilation and @xcite detected a few cases of triple systems .",
    "however , these were fragmentary , almost anecdotal observations and there clearly exists a need of quantifying the matter of the multiplicity of very close binaries .",
    "this paper attempts to characterize all indications of triplicity and/or multiplicity by categorizing contact systems into those with `` detected '' , `` suspected '' and `` non - detected '' companions , with an additional obvious category of `` not observed '' ones .",
    "the techniques actually used are described in sections  [ direct ]  [ indicators ] .",
    "not all techniques discussed by us are equally useful and not all imaginable techniques have been considered ; there is still a lot of room for expansion .",
    "also , types of companions are not explicitly discussed in the paper as our goal was simply to summarize the extant information irrespectively of what accompanies a given contact binary .",
    "thus , a huge subject of selection effects and biases is only glanced over in this paper .",
    "future studies , such as paper  ii of this series on spectroscopic detection in spectra used for the ddo radial velocity program @xcite , will more fully address specific limitations of various detection techniques .",
    "we describe our sample in section  [ sample ] .",
    "the main results of this paper are described in sections  [ direct ]  [ indicators ] and summarized in table  [ summary ] where we collect all partial results and attempt to combine `` suspected '' cases into detections .",
    "results for individual cases are summarized in a condensed form in the column flags by codes specific for each technique .",
    "the codes are explained in table  [ flags ] while individual binaries requiring comments are listed in table  [ notes ] .",
    "section  [ conclude ] summarizes the main results of this study while section  [ future ] gives a discussion of possible directions for the future work .",
    "meaningful statistical results on stellar properties , including the matter of multiplicity , can only be properly studied utilizing volume limited samples .",
    "unfortunately , a proper volume - limited sample of contact binaries does not exists .",
    "in fact , as we describe below , we are very far from having even a good magnitude - limited sample .    as usually for stellar statistics based on diversified data , strengths and biases of various techniques tend to depend on brightness .",
    "we decided to set a limit for our sample at the magnitude @xmath3 .",
    "this magnitude limit is a compromise between a sufficient size of the sample and a reasonable completeness . at this point",
    "we feel confident that the only complete sample of contact binaries with variability amplitudes @xmath4 mag .",
    "is that of the hipparcos catalogue @xcite which extends to @xmath5 . from now on , we will call it `` the hipparcos sample '' or `` the 7.5 mag .",
    "sample '' . beyond that limit",
    ", the hipparcos target selection was driven by lists existing in the early 1980 s , so that the hipparcos catalog is incomplete .    the original 7.5 mag .",
    "sample , as defined in @xcite , consists of 32 stars , in this 13 genuine contact binaries ( ew ) , 14 ellipsoidal variables of small amplitude ( el ) and 5 binaries with unequally deep minima ( eb ) . since",
    "small amplitude contact binaries are expected to dominate in numbers @xcite , it is reasonable to consider the el and the ew systems together .",
    "it is not obvious if we should add to these the eb systems @xcite , but their number is relatively small . for the purpose of this paper , we decided to include in the 7.5 mag .",
    "sample three triple systems ( v867  ara , kr  com and ht  vir ) , where the contact binary is slightly , by less than 0.1 mag . , fainter than @xmath5 , but the total brightness beyond that limit led previously to their elimination from the sample .",
    "this is consistent with the `` fuzzy '' @xmath3 limit that we adopt in this paper , as described below .    assuming a simple scaling law for the uniform , homogeneous stellar density",
    ", we can expect that the 10 mag .",
    "sample should be @xmath6 larger than the 7.5 mag .  sample . thus , it should have about one thousand binaries .",
    "in fact , the 10 mag.sample consists of 151 objects which directly shows that huge numbers of contact binaries still remain to be discovered in the interval @xmath7 .",
    "a part of this discrepancy is probably the detection threshold for variability amplitudes which is about 0.05 mag .  for the hipparcos sample , but is not uniform and possibly at a level of 0.1  0.2 mag.for the 10 mag",
    ".  sample .",
    "the number of 35 binaries in the hipparcos sample is small for meaningful statistical inferences , but it can provide some guidance on the triple - system incidence for the @xmath3 sample . utilizing techniques identical to those described in detail in this paper ,",
    "we see 17 triple systems which corresponds to the lower limit on the relative incidence of triple systems of @xmath8% .",
    "as we will see in sections  [ conclude ]  [ future ] , this is consistent with , but slightly lower than the results for the full @xmath9 = 10 mag .",
    "sample indicating this fraction to be 59% @xmath1 8% .",
    "we note that a large fraction of the hipparcos sample ( about 1/3 ) are actually low photometric amplitude binaries discovered by this satellite ; these binaries have been studied only during the last 7  8 years and still have incomplete data .",
    "we note that we encountered several difficulties in observing the strict limit of 10 mag .",
    "in particular , our definition of @xmath9 refers to the combined magnitude of all components in the system , irrespectively if this is just a binary or has a companion .",
    "since we a priori do not know how many stars are in the system , such a `` fuzzy '' definition explicitly depends on the number of components in the system . while we recognize this uncertainty , we note that a comparable uncertainty of a few 0.1 mag.in the magnitude limit is currently introduced by differences between photometric systems and a generally poor state of uniform , calibrated photometric data for contact binaries . in the practical implementation of the @xmath3 limit we have been forced to use several sources .",
    "we usually took @xmath9 from the general catalogue of variable stars ( hereafter gcvs ) . for stars without @xmath9 magnitudes in the gcvs ,",
    "we used 5th percentile of the hipparcos brightness ( h49 field in the hipparcos catalog @xcite ) ; these @xmath10 magnitudes were then transformed to johnson photometric systems by interpolating in the tables of @xmath11 ( tables 1.3.5 . and 1.3.6 in volume  1 of the hipparcos catalogue ) .",
    "for a few stars not observed during the hipparcos mission and having only photographic or photo - visual maximum magnitude in gcvs , we took approximate @xmath9 from original papers .    finally , we want to note that we resisted very hard a temptation to use other samples in addition to the 10 mag .  sample .",
    "some sources provided deeper samples .",
    "for example , a sample based on the hipparcos astrometric data would consist of 177 systems and  for some binaries  would go well beyond the adopted magnitude limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the hipparcos sample is incomplete before the 10 mag .",
    "limit is reached and some bright systems are not included or have poor data .",
    "other techniques and methods that we used had different biases and limitations so that we would have to analyze each sample separately . in the end",
    ", we decided to strictly observe the limit of @xmath0 which results in the final sample of 151 binaries .",
    "we list binaries fainter than 10 mag .  separately in the second half of table  [ summary ] ,",
    "but we do not utilize them for the multiplicity frequency estimates nor do we show them in frequency plots .",
    "they are included here partly for the record , with an expectation that the magnitude limit will soon be improved , partly to show that different techniques and multiplicity indicators have different properties at faint brightness levels .",
    "we note that table  [ summary ] may be taken as a useful list for further work on candidates of multiplicity .",
    "the most obvious of all detection techniques is the direct visual detection utilizing speckle interferometry or high - resolution imaging ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a large body of data for multiple stars has been collected by @xcite ; his comprehensive catalogue of physical multiple stars provides data on such quantities as the brightness , distance , position angle , astrometric data and hierarchy in multiple systems .",
    "these data have been used in the present study together with the hipparcos catalogue @xcite data , augmented by the post - hipparcos improved orbits of many wide systems by @xcite , with component separation and photometric data revised by @xcite .",
    "a visual detection should involve confirmation of the physical link , which is usually relatively simple for contact binaries as  photometrically  they occur within the width of the main sequence so that a plausible combination of magnitude and color differences is usually sufficient to establish a physical connection .",
    "the main problem here is the lack of standardized photometric data for a large fraction of contact systems .",
    "bright  hence nearby  contact binaries appear randomly on the sky , usually on an empty sky so that the presence of a close visual companion can be frequently taken as an indication of the triplicity , obviously requiring confirmation .",
    "visual detections and astrometric data have been accumulated over a long time as a result of many investigations using different instruments and methods . the washington double star ( wds ) catalog @xcite appears to be the most complete and best updated compilation of these results ;",
    "the major contributor to the wds is the hipparcos satellite mission @xcite .",
    "one of great contributions of this satellite , in addition to the well - known astrometric results , was in the photometric discovery of many low amplitude , @xmath12 mag . ,",
    "inclusion of these variables dramatically improved the available data on the statistics of close binaries @xcite after appropriate allowance for binaries misclassified as pulsating variables , particularly after a major effort to identify those unrecognized contact binaries by @xcite .    among the 137 systems listed in the hipparcos catalogue , 43",
    "are listed in wds to form visual binaries with a distant third body , although some ( e.g. , aw  uma , see section  [ conclude ] ) are in proper - motion pairs with very long , practically un - measurable orbital periods , yet at physical separations indicating a common origin .",
    "multiplicity of a few systems ( v867  ara , qw  gem , cn  hyi , v1387  ori , y  sex , and tu  umi ) was discovered by the hipparcos mission while multiplicity of cv  cyg and ef  dra was discovered by the tycho project of that mission ( see the tycho double star catalogue : @xcite ) .    in order to avoid a distance bias , instead of the angular sky separation ( @xmath13 ) as a criterion of a physical link",
    ", we utilized distances to find the projected separations in au . for systems having hipparcos parallaxes ( @xmath14 ) with relative error less than 20%",
    ", the separations were determined as @xmath15 .",
    "distances to systems without reliable parallaxes were determined using the absolute magnitude calibration of @xcite which is based on the orbital period and color index ; for a few systems , the color index had to be estimated from the spectral type or even more crudely from the orbital period . for em  cep and v395  and",
    ", the @xmath16 index is too blue for the calibration to apply . for em  cep a distance of @xmath17 = 794 pc",
    "was adopted assuming its membership in ngc7160 @xcite .",
    "the spectral type of b78 for v395  and with the main sequence components implies a distance of 450pc , but this is an upper limit as the components can be sdb stars @xcite .",
    "the direct visual detections documented in the wds are marked in table  [ summary ] by the first of the eight flags ( flag-1 ) , which can take the following designations : `` d '' for detected ( separations less than 2,000 au or 0.01 pc ) , `` p '' for possible cases ( separations between 2,000 and 20,000 au corresponding to 0.01 to 0.1 pc ) , and `` n '' for separations larger than 20,000 au .",
    "a program of direct detection of infrared companions using the adaptive optics system on the canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) was undertaken by one of the authors ( smr ) on two nights in 1998 .",
    "it consisted of one - color , one - epoch , high spatial resolution imaging to @xmath18 arcsec .",
    "the data have been analyzed in a cursory way because continuation of the program is expected so that the results should be considered as preliminary .",
    "the observations were obtained with the pueo instrument and the kir camera combination @xcite in the @xmath19 and @xmath20 infrared bands ( 1.65 and 2.2 @xmath21 ) on january 10/11 and july 23/24 , 1998 .",
    "most observations were done in the @xmath20 band and its narrow band version , the @xmath22 band , with a few binaries observed also in the @xmath19 band .",
    "fields of @xmath23 arcsec were observed , centered on contact binaries visible from cfht to approximately @xmath24 .",
    "the scale on the detector was 0.0348 arcsec / pixel .",
    "the measured fwhm of corrected images was 0.143 arcsec in the @xmath20 band , which is very close to the expected diffraction limited performance of a 3.6 meter telescope .",
    "we used the psf subtraction only for obvious , easily visible companions at separations below 1  arcsec ; we did not apply this technique to search for new , faint companions perhaps hiding in the diffraction ring structure of the primary  this may be attempted in the future . in spite of the cursory treatment , we detected seven previously not identified companions at separations smaller than 5 arcsec to gz  and , ah  aur , ck  boo , sw  lac , v508  oph , u  peg and rz  tau . in all those cases , judging by the values of magnitude differences @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we suspect the companions to be late - type dwarfs .",
    "we estimate that our detection limit in the sense of the smallest separations is about 0.08 arcsec ( for a system with identical components ) ; this is based on the case of ck  boo where a fainter companion was easily to detect at a separation of 0.12 arcsec .",
    "some of the observed fields contain close companions at moderate angular separations ( @xmath27 arcsec ) which may be physically associated with the central contact binaries because such angular separations for nearby stars still imply physical distances between stars well below the typical average in the solar neighborhood .",
    "these cases must be supported by other evidence which we currently do not have .",
    "results of the cfht observations are listed in table  [ cfht ] .",
    "we give the separation in arcsec , the position angle in degrees and the difference in magnitudes relative to the primary ( contact binary ) component in the @xmath20 or @xmath19 bands .",
    "the final assessment of the physical connection is based  similarly as for the directly observable visual binaries ( section  [ wds ] )  on the projected separation of the components . in table",
    "[ summary ] , the results are coded by flag-2 , similarly as for objects discussed in the previous section  [ wds ] , except for the symbol ``  '' which signifies that the star was not observed .      the most important astrometric results and the reason for the hipparcos mission were trigonometric parallaxes of nearby stars .",
    "parallax errors and quality estimates of astrometric and orbital solutions are cataloged in the hipparcos double and multiple annex for all known or discovered visual pairs .",
    "we present here an argument that the parallax error data carry useful information on multiplicity .",
    "the hipparcos parallax error depends primarily on the brightness and less so on the ecliptical latitude of a system , but it increases if an unseen component causes a transverse motion of the star on the sky .",
    "the astrometric solution can be also deteriorated by a variability - induced motion of the photocenter in a close visual or unresolved system with a variable component ; such a motion can be particularly pronounced for large amplitude variables like mira pulsating stars ( @xcite ) , but may also affect all other variables , including contact binaries . in what follows",
    "we analyze the parallax errors as indicators of multiplicity of contact binaries . for an assessment of the multiplicity ,",
    "the most important hipparcos catalog data are :    * the astrometric solution type ( the catalog field code h59 ) ; the first character in the column hip in table  [ summary ] .",
    "it may take values of `` c '' for a linear motion of components , `` x '' for a stochastic solution , `` g '' for an acceleration term being necessary .",
    "while `` x '' and `` g '' apply for apparently single stars ( 6 cases in our sample ) , `` c '' refers to known visual systems . *",
    "the quality of the double or multiple star solution ( the field code h61 ) .",
    "this is indicated by the second symbol in the column hip in table  [ summary ] .",
    "the flag `` s '' indicates that a possible , although unconvincing , non - single solution was found for an apparently single star ; 17 such systems appear in our sample . for",
    "known visual binaries , the solutions are coded by `` a '' to `` d '' , in progression from best to worst . a very poor quality of the solution ( i.e. , the flags `` c '' or `` d '' ) indicates a possible additional perturbation in the visual system . * the hipparcos parallax error ( field h16 ) ; column @xmath28 in table  [ summary ] .",
    "35 systems have parallax errors more than 3@xmath29 larger than respective median values at given brightness levels .    an inspection of the catalog shows that three contact systems , v353  peg , er  ori , and v2388  oph , required an acceleration term in the astrometric solution ,",
    "hence they are most probably astrometric double stars with orbital periods longer than about 10 years ( see section 2.3.3 of the hipparcos catalogue ) .",
    "the acceleration terms in astrometric solution of er  ori are relatively large : @xmath306.57 mas  yr@xmath31 and @xmath324.71 mas  yr@xmath31 ( the unit `` mas '' to be used hereinafter is equal 0.001 of arcsec , for a milli - arcsec ) .",
    "several systems , which are very probably unresolved visual binaries , show `` stochastic '' , i.e. , an excessive random scatter in deviations from their astrometric solutions ( cl  cet , be  scl , fi  boo , ak  her , v401  cyg , and cw  sge ] ) .",
    "the so - called `` cosmic error '' @xmath33 given in the hipparcos catalog describes the scatter in the astrometric solution .",
    "it is of considerable astrophysical interest as it gives the most probable size of the astrometric orbit and points at relatively tight orbits with periods shorter than one year .",
    "the cosmic error is the largest for v401  cyg with @xmath34 mas and be  scl where @xmath35 mas .",
    "the systems are prime candidates for speckle interferometric observations .",
    "in fact , @xcite performed speckle interferometry of hipparcos doubles and hipparcos problem stars ( i.e.  stars having `` v '' , `` o '' , `` g '' , `` x '' in h59 or `` s '' in h61 ) and detected 15 new visual doubles with a mean separation about 0.2 arcsec . among these stars was v353  peg ( `` g '' flag in h59 ) but no companion of this star at an angular separation larger than 0.035 arcsec was detected @xcite .",
    "the parallax error vs.  hipparcos magnitude @xmath36 is plotted in figure  [ errpx - v ] .",
    "the figure clearly shows that known visual binaries ( marked by filled circles ) show large parallax errors , a condition which can be used as a criterion indicating multiplicity .",
    "the large parallax errors correspond also to stochastic solutions or to cases where necessity of acceleration term occurred ( symbols in the figure framed by a square ) .",
    "of note is the case of er  ori with a formally _ negative _ parallax @xmath37 mas .",
    "in addition to systems already indicated in the hipparcos catalogue , large parallax errors of dy  cet , ux  eri and v1363  ori strongly suggest multiplicity .",
    "a summary of all multiplicity indications derived from the astrometric parallax data appears in table  [ summary ] under flag-3 .",
    "detections are marked by `` d '' for `` x '' or `` g '' type solutions , while the suspected cases `` s '' correspond to those already suspected in the hipparcos catalog ( `` s '' in h61 ) , systems with `` c '' type quality of orbital solutions and systems with parallax errors more than 3@xmath29 from the median error ( where @xmath29 is the @xmath38 uncertainty in the median error value ) .",
    "three systems not recognized before as the `` s '' cases , but having parallax errors larger than 3@xmath29 relative to the error median , have been added here : ux  eri , v1363  eri and dy  cet .",
    "`` n '' signifies no detection .",
    "if a system was not included in the hipparcos missions , then flag-3 is ``  '' .    in terms of its precision",
    ", the hipparcos sample is biased mainly by two factors , the apparent brightness and the distance , as astrometric effects are smaller at larger distances . as a partial result on the true frequency of triple systems , and to visualize potential biases , we attempted to estimate the fraction of visual and astrometric triples solely from the astrometric data for the nearest , best observed contact binaries . for this , we ranked the binaries according to the parallax , with the system of rank `` 1 '' being the closest contact binary 44  boo .",
    "this sample contains 133 contact binaries brighter than @xmath9 = 10 that appear in the hipparcos catalogue and have positive astrometric parallaxes . in figure",
    "[ visual ] the left vertical axis gives the fraction of systems below and including a given rank , listed as visual binaries in wds and suspected in hipparcos ( flags `` x '' , `` g '' and `` s '' ) .",
    "the right vertical axis gives the total number of such systems for the given rank .",
    "since one of the visual components is a contact binary , these systems are at least triple .",
    "for the 50 closest contact systems , the fraction of systems being at least triple shows a plateau and appears to be 40% although the poissonian noise at that point is about 9% .",
    "such an estimate of the triple - system frequency , based only on the astrometric data , is incomplete as we have a direct evidence that the true frequency is higher : additional 8 multiple systems with contact binaries were detected spectroscopically ( section  [ spectroscopy ] ) without any astrometric indications of multiplicity ( not even the `` s '' flag ) in the hipparcos astrometric data while two more very close systems ( ck  boo and u  peg ) were discovered during the cfht adaptive - optics observations ( section  [ sec_cfht ] ) .",
    "the hipparcos mission provided an excellent new epoch datum for proper motion studies of nearby stars .",
    "proper motion data improve over time as the time - base grows .",
    "use of the old data led to the main improvement in the proper motion results from the tycho-2 project @xcite when compared with the original hipparcos results based on 3 years of the satellite operation .",
    "we can utilize this material the same way as described above for the parallax errors by analyzing individual errors of the proper motion determinations .",
    "we note that the proper motion errors depend on many factors such as ( i )  the time interval covered by observations , ( ii )  the number and quality of astrometric data , and ( iii )  the brightness of the system .",
    "figure  [ err - proper ] presents evidence that known visual systems among contact binaries have larger proper - motion errors , so that the situation is indeed analogous to that with the parallax errors .",
    "the difference is in the time scale of the external orbit as this indicator is sensitive to companions orbiting on large orbits , with the tycho-2 data sensitive to periods spanning perhaps as long as a fraction of a century ; this should be contrasted with the hipparcos parallax errors which were estimated from internal uncertainties of the mission lasting 3 years .    in figure",
    "[ err - proper ] , note the known members of visual binaries such as ee  cet or v752  mon .",
    "other systems , like v376  and or v2377  oph may be members of triple systems with relatively long - period orbits .",
    "for the statistics in table  [ summary ] , we take as suspicious cases all systems with proper - motion errors 3@xmath29 above the tycho-2 error median , as before assuming @xmath29 to be the @xmath38 uncertainty of the median .",
    "we included fu  dra , v829  her and v839  oph which are close to this limit .",
    "we note that in the error estimation , one must be careful with systems having only 3 astrometric observations , as one erroneous observation would result in a large error of the derived proper motion .",
    "spectroscopy offers one of the most direct methods of discovery of companions to contact binaries . when a companion is present , extraction techniques utilizing deconvolution of spectra , such as the broadening functions ( bf , see @xcite ) or their poor - quality substitute , the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) , often show one sharp peak superimposed on a background of a broad and rapidly changing projection of the contact binary brightness onto the radial - velocity space .    the radial velocity program at the david dunlap observatory ( currently at paper  x and 90-th orbit , @xcite ) is specifically designed to provide radial velocity data for close binary systems with periods shorter than one day and brighter than about 10 magnitude .",
    "it was noticed almost from the beginning of the program in 1999 that our sample contained many triple systems with third components frequently dominating in light .",
    "this turned out not an accidental occurrence , but an interesting , if mild , bias in our sample : our candidates have been predominantly from among recent photometric discoveries  frequently by the hipparcos project  with small photometric amplitudes . while for some of these cases the low amplitudes happened to be due to a low orbital inclination , for many binaries , when a companion is present , the reason is the `` dilution '' of the photometric signal in the combined light .",
    "these low photometric amplitude binaries were not known until the systematic ( to @xmath39 ) hipparcos survey took place .",
    "spectroscopically , these stars had been frequently overlooked as their spectra  even when the companion is relatively fainter  typically show only one sharp - line component , sometimes only with some fine and hard to detect continuum peculiarities @xcite .    at this time , out of 90 stars with new , reliable elements determined during the ddo spectroscopic binary program , 76 are contact binaries and/or probably contact binaries . among those ,",
    "12 are members of visual binaries , some already identified by other techniques .",
    "we discovered spectroscopic companions in v899  her and vz  lib @xcite , v401  cyg @xcite , as well as vw  lmi , tv  umi and ag  vir ( to be published ) . but",
    "not all of our detections were new : because of the moderately poor seeing at the ddo site with a median fwhm of about 1.8 arcsec , some already known astrometric companions were not visible directly during the observations and appeared first time in the spectroscopically derived broadening functions .",
    "this way , we re - discovered several multiple systems ( e.g. , ef  dra , v410  aur ) .",
    "examples of the broadening functions for the spectroscopically triple systems can be found in the series of ddo publications , particularly in paper  iv @xcite , paper  vi @xcite and paper  viii @xcite .",
    "here we show in figure  [ vwlmi ] the broadening functions for an even more complex quadruple system vw  lmi whose complicated nature has been discovered during the ddo program ( to be published ) .",
    "the detection limit for spectroscopic companions , given by the ratio of the third component light to the total light of the eclipsing pair @xmath40 , at our spectral window at 5184  , is about 0.03  0.04 .",
    "this estimate is based on the cases of v401  cyg ( @xmath41 ) and hx  uma ( @xmath42 ) where a weak light contribution was easily detectable .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath43 in the most favorable case ; normally , the detection limit depends on the shape of the combined bf as the sharp peak may sometimes hide within the two lobes of the binary .",
    "an opposite extreme case of a bright companion entirely masking any traces of the contact binary in the broadening function is v752  mon ( new , unpublished ddo observations ) , where at @xmath44 , the companion is a rapidly rotating a - type star with @xmath45 km  s@xmath46 .",
    "generally , it is difficult to map the domain of detection of third components as it depends not only on @xmath47 , but also on the @xmath48 of the binary , its mass ratio , @xmath49 of the third component , etc .",
    "while our individual broadening functions which are used for radial velocity measurements have a limitation for the smallest @xmath47 detectable at a given s / n , averaging of the same spectra may show fainter companions to @xmath50 or even below . while the binary signatures are smeared out through averaging , any constant component gains in definition .",
    "this is exactly the approach taken in paper  ii @xcite where spectra previously utilized in the ddo radial velocity have been used to detect weak tio features of m - type dwarfs in e.g. , sw  lac , ck  boo and bb  peg .",
    "a particularly good example is sw  lac which was not seen in individual bf s @xcite , but could be convincingly detected in the average spectrum .",
    "the faint companions are also detectable through the presence of the molecular bands of tio , vo , cah . in the visual and near infrared regions , the tio bands are the dominant source of molecular absorption in stars later than m3 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "particularly prominent tio features occur around 5500   and around 7600 .",
    "we refer to paper  ii @xcite for details of the spectrum averaging technique which is discussed there with a particular stress on its biases and limitations .",
    "the spectral region utilized at ddo for the radial velocity program , of about 200  300   ( depending on the ccd detector ) centered at 5184  , is a very convenient one for radial velocity measurements because the magnesium triplet `` b '' feature is strong over a wide range of spectral types from middle a to early k types , but is not optimal for detection of faint , low temperature companions .",
    "for that reason , we plan to conduct a search based on good quality , low - dispersion , red spectra of contact binaries with a specific goal of detection of molecular features characteristic for late - type companions .",
    "we note that the disentangling technique @xcite ) has a potential of determination of the individual spectra from multi - component spectra undergoing radial - velocity shifts .",
    "the method produces orbital parameters of the spectroscopic binary as well as information on any additional spectrum in the system ; thus telluric lines as well as lines of a third component are naturally determined .",
    "flag-5 in table  [ summary ] gives information on triplicity as determined from spectroscopy , both in the radial velocity program and in the averaged spectral data .",
    "the codes used are : `` d '' used for detection , `` s '' for suspicion , `` n '' for not detected and ``  '' not yet observed or not analyzed",
    ".      a scatter or trends in the center - of - mass velocity , @xmath51 , may indicate presence of companions . because radial velocities usually come from different sources with different systematic errors and because contact binaries show large broadening of spectral lines , this is a difficult - to - apply and generally poor indicator of multiplicity . as we will see below , the required accuracy for @xmath51 ( i.e.  precision combined with systematic uncertainties ) for the well known close visual multiple systems of 44  boo and vw  cep is at a level of 1  km  s@xmath46 , which is very difficult to obtain for contact binaries . to complicate things ,",
    "very few contact binaries have been observed for radial velocities more than at one epoch so that a comparison of published systemic velocities can be done for only a few objects :    * ab  and has three sets of spectroscopic elements @xcite . while the second and the third source give similar @xmath51 , the first gives a velocity shifted by @xmath52 km  s@xmath46 .",
    "* 44  boo has several rv studies .",
    "the results of early studies are discussed by @xcite , with the most reliable data subsequently published by @xcite .",
    "systemic velocity changes were observed to range between @xmath53 and @xmath54 km  s@xmath46 , which is much more than the expected full amplitude for the well studied visual system of only 0.7 km  s@xmath46 .",
    "we suspect that the scatter in @xmath51 is purely instrumental in this case .",
    "* vw  cep was observed 5 times ; see @xcite for the discussion and references .",
    "the systemic velocity shows a much larger spread ( @xmath55 to @xmath56 km  s@xmath46 ) than can be expected from the known third body , expected to cause a full amplitude of @xmath57 5.8 km  s@xmath46 .",
    "again , the most likely reason for the scatter is instrumental .",
    "* spectral lines of a third component were detected in sw  lac by @xcite .",
    "three available systemic velocities @xcite range between @xmath58 and @xmath59 km  s@xmath46 , which can be considered as a case of an exceptionally good agreement and thus constancy of the mean velocity .",
    "this is somewhat paradoxical as we know that the system contains at least one additional component .",
    "* v502  oph has four studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted a @xmath60 km  s@xmath46 shift in radial velocities between the two of their runs .",
    "lines of a third component were detected by @xcite .",
    "* there exist seven published radial velocity datasets for w  uma @xcite .",
    "systemic velocities show large variability in the range from @xmath61 to @xmath62 km  s@xmath46 .",
    "part of the scatter can be instrumental , but presence of a third body in the system is possible .",
    "* possible multiplicity of aw  uma has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the observed systemic velocity changes would require a relatively massive body which was not detected in bf s of the system @xcite .",
    "the system is a prime candidate for a new spectroscopic study .    on the basis of the observed large systemic velocity changes , two systems , w  uma and aw  uma , are coded as `` s '' ( suspected ) by the flag-5 in table  [ summary ]",
    "accelerated or delayed times of eclipses in close binaries are normally interpreted as a result of apparent period changes .",
    "these changes may result from the binary revolution on a wide orbit around a center of mass with a companion ; this is then frequently called the `` lite '' for the light - time effect @xcite . because intrinsic period changes in close binaries are quite common due to their strong physical interaction , the presence of the lite is usually not conclusive , but can prompt other observations .",
    "such was the case of vw  cep where periodic variation of the eclipse times was interpreted by the lite very early by @xcite . in 1974 , the third component had been indicated by the transverse motion of the contact pair and then was directly observed @xcite .    the period of an eclipsing binary is the most precisely determined orbital element due to accumulation of period deviations over many orbits .",
    "traditionally , timing of eclipses has been a separate activity concentrated on the light minima only @xcite , but new techniques utilize whole light curves @xcite while new light - curve fitting codes even include the lite to enable the analysis of short - period triple systems @xcite .",
    "the lite technique has several advantages over the other approaches because ( i )  it is distance independent , ( ii )  light minima can be observed with small telescopes , ( iii )  the time delay / advance effect , in contrast to its spectroscopic - amplitude counterpart ( the variation in @xmath51 ) , increases with the period of the third body , and ( iv )  detection is independent of the relative brightness of the third component .",
    "the technique has also pitfalls : ( i )  the behavior of ( o  c ) residuals ( observed minus calculated time of eclipse ) very often indicates periods being similar to about 2/3 of the used time interval ; this may be a signal of a failure in the main lite assumptions leading to over - interpretation of the data ; ( ii )  detection of short - period orbits may be negatively influenced by the enhanced surface activity @xcite and migrating spots can sometimes cause wavelike behavior of the ( o  c ) diagrams ( see e.g , @xcite ) ; fortunately , the spot - induced shifts of the eclipse minima usually only increase the scatter of observed minima times @xcite ; ( iii )  another possible interpretation of the cyclic period changes is a periodic transfer of the orbital angular momentum to magnetic momentum in active systems @xcite ; while this may be the case , the actual confirmation of this mechanism still remains to be done and is still controversial @xcite .",
    "the formulae for the theoretical lite computation can be found in @xcite .",
    "an observed time of the minimum light can be predicted as follows : @xmath63,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is speed of light , @xmath65 is the quadratic ephemeris of eclipsing pair ( a secular change of the period measured by @xmath66 is the most likely type of change for the binary itself ) , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 are the orbital parameters and @xmath71 is the true anomaly of the binary on the orbit around the common center of gravity with the third body .",
    "since the lite operates in the radial direction through a mechanism similar to the doppler effect , the lite parameters are similar to spectroscopic elements .",
    "the problem of cyclic variations in the period is one of a simple model fitting : given pairs @xmath72 and @xmath73 , one must optimize parameters @xmath74 and ephemeris of the eclipsing pair @xmath75 .    for the present analysis ,",
    "the contact binaries were selected from the updated version of the catalogue of contact binary stars ( hereafter ccbs , @xcite ) currently containing 391 systems . among these , 129 have more than 15 ccd or _",
    "pe _ minima in the cracow database ( the may 2004 version , @xcite ) . because standard errors are available for only a small part of the minima times and can not be trusted , we applied an arbitrary weighting scheme with the weights assigned as @xmath76 = 10 to _ pe _ , @xmath76 = 5 to ccd , @xmath76 = 3 to visual and photographic and @xmath76 = 1 to `` patrol '' and single - epoch plate minima .",
    "the weight @xmath77 minima were used only in cases when no other minima were available .",
    "only 18 out of 129 systems provided stable lite solutions . in our sample of contact binaries",
    "brighter than @xmath0 there are 57 systems with a sufficient number of minima ; among them 11 have feasible lite solutions .",
    "an analysis of all available minima and new lite solutions are presented here for ty  boo , tz  boo , ck  boo , gw  cep , ux  eri , v566  oph and bb  peg .",
    "the resulting parameters are given in table  [ lite ] while figure  [ omc ] illustrates two rather typical cases of tz  boo and bb  peg .",
    "for sw  lac and ck  boo , the orbital period @xmath78 is very uncertain and its inclusion as an unknown in fact destabilized the solutions . in case of ux  eri , inclusion of the orbital eccentricity destabilizes the solution .",
    "in addition to the approximate orbital elements , table  [ lite ] gives minimum mass of the third body determined from the mass function and total masses of the eclipsing pair .",
    "for the latter , we used the ccbs data , in available cases modified by values determined in the ddo program of spectroscopic orbit determinations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we also give the expected angular separation of the third ( or multiple components ) in arcsec for cases of available trigonometric parallaxes , evaluated as @xmath79 .",
    "inspection of table  [ lite ] shows that minimum masses for some systems ( ah  vir , er  ori , ck  boo and the outer body in sw  lac ) appear to be unrealistically high which indicates that cyclic variations may have been caused by other effects , perhaps intrinsic to the binary .",
    "predicted mean separations for several systems ( e.g. , ab  and , ck  boo , v566  oph ) are accessible to speckle or direct detection . in fact , ck  boo was independently detected as a visual double during cfht observations ( section  [ sec_cfht ] ) while an uv excess may indicate existence of a white dwarf in the system @xcite .",
    "sw  lac requires a special attention as this may be a quadruple system .",
    "the first consistent lite solution @xcite was not stable and could not fully explain the behavior of older minima .",
    "multiplicity of the system was clearly seen in the spectra of @xcite . we have found it to be well separated in the cfht @xmath20 and @xmath19-band adaptive optics observations ( section  [ sec_cfht ] ) with the third component too far on the sky to cause the observed lite .",
    "detection of the lite obviously depends on the number of available minima , although other factors , such as their temporal distribution , are also important .",
    "thus , systems can be ranked according to this number which reflects our chances to detect a cyclic period change . in fig .",
    "[ litefig ] the fraction of lite - detected multiple systems is plotted with respect to the rank of system , sorted according to the number of the available minima times .",
    "it is obvious that detection of multiple components among the studied systems is strongly dependent on the availability of data .",
    "for the first best observed 20 systems , the multiplicity rate appears to be as high as about 60% @xmath1 17% .",
    "it should be noted that most of those systems are the northern hemisphere ones as too few eclipses have been observed for southern contact binaries to permit lite studies .",
    "we will return to the point of the disparity between the hemispheres in the conclusions of the paper ( section  [ future ] ) .",
    "the chance of detecting a third body by the lite is restricted to periods from a few years ( where the ( o  c ) amplitudes are small ) to several tens of years by the available span of the data ; indeed , most systems in table  [ lite ] have periods about 30 years",
    ". if the third component is the dominant source of light , it can reduce the photometric amplitude of the eclipsing pair ( e.g. , the case of tu  umi , @xcite ) making determination of the eclipse moments very imprecise or even entirely impossible . in view of this observational bias",
    ", the 60% incidence of triple systems may be considered as possibly a low limit to an even higher value .    in table",
    "[ summary ] the resulting lite status ( flag-6 ) is coded as follows : `` d '' for a stable solution , `` s '' for not fully stable solution or / and less than 1.5 cycles of @xmath78 covered , `` n '' for no detection , and ``  '' for too few minima or less than 10 years of ccd or _",
    "pe _ observations . in our view , the lite is almost certainly present in ab  and , vw  cep , ak  her , sw  lac , xy  leo , and ah  vir .",
    "the period  color relation for contact binary stars was discovered observationally by @xcite and was utilized later for various theoretical investigations of these systems .",
    "the relation is a consequence of contact binaries being main sequence objects , with all implied correlations between the mass , effective temperature and radius , hence the size and thus the period .",
    "observationally , the relation is a very useful tool in recognizing contact binaries in deep variability surveys and , together with the luminosity calibration @xmath80 @xcite , it forms a powerful discriminator for identifying contact binaries among short - period variable stars .",
    "the color index @xmath81 can be replaced by @xmath82 or any other index ; an unpublished @xmath83 calibration also exists ( rucinski , in preparation ) .",
    "as pointed before @xcite the period  color relation must have a short - period , blue envelope ( spbe ) .",
    "its locus corresponds to the zero age main sequence of least evolved stars , when it is applied to stars in contact and expressed in terms of the period and a color index .",
    "evolution and expansion of components can lead to lengthening of the period and to reddening of the color index ; reddening may be also caused by the interstellar extinction .",
    "thus , one does not expect contact binaries to appear blue - ward of the spbe . yet",
    ", some close binaries do show up there .",
    "@xcite suggested a simple approximation to the spbe , @xmath84 , and an explanation for the blue outliers as non - contact stars , possibly algols or @xmath47  lyr binaries with a blue component dominating in the combined color index ; a lowered metallicity may also explain some of the blue deviations @xcite .",
    "however , some of the blue outliers may be multiple systems with the color index peculiarity caused by a blue third star .",
    "the period - color relation for 151 contact binaries brighter than @xmath9 = 10 with the @xmath81 data from tycho-2 is shown in figure  [ spbe ] .",
    "one can immediately see that several systems are substantially bluer than the spbe .",
    "some of them are indeed known triple systems ( e.g. , v867  ara , kp  peg ) .",
    "the most deviating systems , and the strongest cases to suspect presence of an early - type component , are v445  cep and v758  cen .",
    "we are very much aware of a possibility of over - interpreting the blue deviations in fig .",
    "[ spbe ] so we do not claim any detections here and point only some systems as suspected cases of multiplicity .",
    "this is marked by the flag `` s '' in table  [ summary ] for cases when the color index deviates by more than 1@xmath29 from the spbe line .",
    "systems not included in the tycho-2 are given the ``  '' flag .",
    "`` n '' signifies no detection .",
    "contact binary stars consist of solar - type stars spun into very rapid rotation by the tidal forces . as a consequence , they are very active and show elevated chromospheric and coronal activity .",
    "an extensive body of data exists on their x - ray emission @xcite and , in particular , on the correlation of the x - ray coronal emission with the two most relevant parameters , the effective temperature , @xmath85 , and the orbital period , @xmath86 ; the former controls the depth of the convective zone while the latter controls the amount of vorticity available for generation of magnetic fields .",
    "a convenient distance independent quantity is the ratio of the apparent x - ray and bolometric fluxes , @xmath87 .",
    "it expresses the x - ray `` efficiency '' of how much of the total available energy is channeled into the x - rays .",
    "@xmath88 can be estimated from the visual magnitude of the star utilizing the bolometric correction @xmath89 . unfortunately , many fainter binaries still do not have any standardized ( say @xmath90 ) photometric data to estimate even an approximate value of @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , to use a homogeneous and simple treatment , we used the shifted spbe relation ( by subtracting 0.2 mag ) to estimate an approximate value of the @xmath81 color index from the orbital period ( see figure  [ spbe ] ) ; because the bolometric correction changes very little between a0 and g5 spectral types , and we are looking for an order - of - magnitude effects in @xmath87 , the resulting approximation is adequate .",
    "the x - ray fluxes were estimated using the procedure described in @xcite from the observed rass x - ray count rate and the hardness ratio ( between the bands 0.1  0.4 kev and 0.5  2.0 kev ) .",
    "the measured x - ray fluxes were corrected for the background count rate . in the computation of bolometric fluxes we took @xmath91 erg  cm@xmath31  s@xmath46 as a flux for @xmath93 = 0 .",
    "the bolometric corrections were interpolated in the table given by @xcite .",
    "we utilized the rass catalog @xcite to find @xmath94 in the band 0.1  2.4 kev for all contact binaries of our sample .",
    "although the catalogue contains its own cross - identifications , after realizing many omissions , we cross - correlated the rass catalogue data with the irsc2 coordinates taken from simbad for all ccbs systems .",
    "the angular separation of 36 arcsec was taken as a limit for detection .",
    "six additional distant sources identified in simbad have been also included .",
    "although not all detections are secure due to the relatively low pointing precision ( typically 10  20 arcsec ) , most identifications are unambiguous as most of the targets do not have any other objects within 0.5 degree",
    ". some binaries of our sample were not detected providing an useful upper limit on @xmath87 , derived from the assumed detection threshold of 0.01 counts / sec .",
    "to better define the lower envelope of the upper limits on @xmath87 , we added also systems fainter than @xmath9 = 10mag .  from ccbs .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ xrays ] .    following the previous investigations @xcite , we expected the ratio @xmath87 to show a weak dependence on the binary orbital period close to a saturation limit at @xmath95 .",
    "however , the scatter in figure  [ xrays ] is large with some deviations reaching factors of 10 or 100 times from the average .",
    "we argue that companions to contact binaries may be the cause of these large deviations and that the deviations may go both ways : ( i )  when an early - type contact binary has an m - dwarf companion or  particularly  a _ binary _ m - dwarf companion ( as in the case of xy  leo ) then @xmath87 can be strongly elevated , but ( ii )  when the contact binary is of solar or later spectral type , its magnetically inactive early - type companion may reduce the value of @xmath87 ( the cases of 44  boo or v752  mon ) .",
    "indeed , this is exactly what we do see in figure  [ xrays ] for the known triple systems : ( i )  in the left lower corner , a few system with the relatively low flux ratio are in majority triple systems where the x - ray flux is diluted by the dominant early - type , single star ( e.g. , v345  gem ) ; ( ii )  majority of short - period systems with high relative x - ray fluxes are triple systems ; in some cases a late - type , binary , by  dra - type companion provides most of the x - ray flux ( e.g. , xy  leo ) , and ( iii )  several early - type , long - period contact systems , expected to be practically inactive , show enhanced x - ray flux ( v335  peg , do  cha or rs  col ) which may indicate that they host a late - type , active companion .",
    "the @xmath87 ratio should be used as an indicator of multiplicity with a considerable caution , particularly in view of the large number of upper limits to the x - ray flux values .",
    "however , it may be highly indicative in individual cases already signaled by other techniques . in figure  [ xrays ]",
    "we marked a line delineating the low x - ray luminosity envelope ( lxle ) of the observed @xmath87 ratios .",
    "the line was selected rather arbitrarily to encompass most of the systems .",
    "systems with @xmath87 hundred times above the lxle are marked in table  [ summary ] by `` l '' , for a `` late - type companion '' .",
    "similarly late - type contact systems with an abnormally low emission , those below the lxle , are marked by `` e '' , for an `` early - type companion '' . for periods",
    "longer than 0.5 days , the lxle is not defined because such contact binaries of spectral types early - f or earlier are not expected to show any detectable x - ray radiation .",
    "the high speed photometry of lunar occultations can lead to detection of multiple components and the technique is widely used @xcite .",
    "an angular detection limit for bright binaries , given by the moon - limb diffraction angular scale is about 2 mas @xcite . for faint stars ,",
    "this limit is modified by the diameter of the telescope through the photon noise in very short integrations utilized in the high - speed photometry . due to the apsidal motion of its orbit ,",
    "the moon can occult about 9% of the sky . from among 391 contact binary stars in the electronic version of ccbs @xcite , 26 lie within the path of the moon ( @xmath96 around the ecliptic ) .    among systems in table",
    "[ summary ] , the best candidates for occultations are bright systems aq  psc ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) , v4408  sgr ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) , v781  tau ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) . somewhat fainter , but interesting systems are : cx  vir , v1123  tau , ap  leo , am  leo , uz  leo , xy  leo , rz  tau , tx  cnc , vz  lib , ah  aur and ct  tau .",
    "the binaries which can be studied using the moon occultation technique are marked by `` m '' in the column `` moon '' in table  [ summary ] ) .",
    "so far only the quadruple system xy  leo was observed @xcite , but with a negative result .",
    "the light curve analysis sometimes indicates a need of a `` third light '' as an additive term in the overall brightness budget . a third component to a binary system can be such third light , but light curves are described by so many parameters , that this is frequently an unreliable indicator of multiplicity .",
    "certainly , for light curves of partially eclipsing spherical stars in only one band , the third light is just an `` easy escape '' to obtain a solution , but for contact binaries its physical reality becomes even more dubious because a more complex geometry .",
    "light - curve synthesis solutions indicating a need of a third light usually show a tight correlation of the third light with the inclination angle and the mass ratio .",
    "even for best constrained solutions of contact binaries showing total eclipses , where inner eclipse contacts can be well defined and the mass ratio can be determined solely from light curves @xcite , a correlation between mass ratio and third light remains .",
    "an example is the case of ef  dra , where the light curve indicated @xmath103 @xcite , while spectroscopic mass ratio is @xmath104 @xcite . usually without spectroscopic determination of the mass ratio it is hardly possible to detect third light from light curves with the usual photometric precision of @xmath105 mag .",
    "the situation improves when the third component has a markedly different spectral type than the binary and when photometry is available in several bandpasses ; then  instead of uncorrelated values of @xmath106 in each band  the proper approach is is to use the radius and temperature of the third star . at this time",
    ", we feel that we have no clear case of a third - light in any of contact binaries of our sample .",
    "a close and massive third body orbiting a binary system can cause precession of the orbital plane and an apsidal motion of the close pair .",
    "the largest dynamical effects are expected for contact binaries which contain least angular momentum among all binaries .",
    "precession of the orbital plane in an eclipsing binary will result in changes of its orbital inclination and thus changes of the photometric amplitude of the eclipses .",
    "the practical use of the method consists of a comparison of high - quality light curves obtained over long time intervals in search of amplitude variations .",
    "the precession period depends on the period ratio @xmath107 and ( weakly ) on the ratio of the outer orbit angular momentum to the total invariable angular momentum and on the ratio of the total triple system mass and to that of he third body mass .",
    "the nodal period is , to the first order ( see eq.(27 ) in @xcite ) , given by : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the total mass , @xmath110 is the total invariable angular momentum of the triple system , @xmath111 is the angular momentum of the outer orbit and @xmath112 is the relative inclination of the orbits .",
    "systematic changes in the eclipse depth indicating orbital precession have been observed in several detached binaries @xcite . however",
    ", none of contact binaries has shown this effect , although many are observed on a routine basis .",
    "chances to see the effect are high due to ( i )  a very low angular momentum of a typical contact binary , ( ii )  its short orbital period , and  usually  ( iii )  a low total mass of the eclipsing pair .",
    "any adverse effects of the photometric system mismatch are also minimized thanks to the same temperature of both components so that the light - curve amplitude is almost independent of the wavelength used , permitting comparison of curves obtained in different photometric systems .",
    "we have carefully inspected our list of contact binaries brighter than @xmath0 with periods shorter than one day to establish all cases which appear to indicate multiplicity .",
    "the last column of table  [ summary ] contains the letter code `` y '' for cases of sufficient information to claim that a contact binary is indeed part of a multiple system .",
    "our decision was based on a combined `` weight '' , as determined from individual detection techniques , equal or exceeding the value of 1.0 . in adding the weights we used a weight of 1.0 for individual unquestionable detections and a weight of 0.5 for suspected cases .",
    "although this approach produces non - subjective and repeatable results , we feel that not all cases for accepted detections are equally valid .",
    "we comment on individual cases requiring explanation in table  [ notes ] .",
    "we see 64 triple systems among 151 objects of our sample , giving the nominal lower limit to the frequency of triple systems of 42% @xmath1 5% .",
    "this result is for both hemispheres , which have not been equally well surveyed to apply all available methods , with the southern hemisphere contributing very few binaries to the final statistics . indeed ,",
    "if not for the hipparcos mission which discovered a few visual binaries containing contact binaries ( e.g. , v867  ara , cn  hyi ) , there would be almost no known visual binary detections in the southern sky . while on the northern sky ( @xmath113 ) , using all available techniques , we see 52 triple systems among 88 objects , giving the frequency of 59% @xmath1 8% , the southern sky yields only 12 systems out of 63 , corresponding to 19% @xmath1 6% .",
    "the reason is the low number of contact binaries discovered so far in the south , a meager volume of photometric data even for the known ones ( some binaries were observed the last time half a century ago ! ) , a lack of any spectroscopic support and a short time base for techniques requiring accumulation over time ( such as visual orbits , proper motions and lite ) .    in principle , our result on the low limit to the frequency of triple systems containing contact binaries of 59% @xmath1 8% should be compared with control samples for single stars and for wider binaries .",
    "such samples are only now being created with the particularly strong contributions of @xcite . however , the data are fragmentary and  even for bright , nearby , single stars  heavily biased by the distance and brightness selection effects .",
    "@xcite found that among 18 closest dwarfs to 8 pc , 5 exist in multiple systems , giving the frequency of 28% .",
    "however , a deeper search based on 3383 dwarfs to 50 pc @xcite yielded only 76 multiple systems , 2.2% , with the heavy bias against discovery setting in for systems beyond 10 pc . while our final conclusion is that triple systems are very frequent for the contact binaries , we note that several of our techniques are different from those of tokovinin and are distance independent ; this may explain our high result when compared with that of @xcite , in spite of the fact that our targets are spread in distance from 13 pc to hundreds of parsecs .",
    "the situation appears to be different for binaries .",
    "@xcite found that the frequency of triplicity and multiplicity among spectroscopic binary stars with orbital periods shorter than 10 days appears to be high : as many as 43% @xmath1 8% ( 26 out of 61 ) among nearby ( within 100 pc ) , low - mass ( 0.5 to 1.5 m@xmath114 ) , spectroscopic binaries cataloged in @xcite have known tertiary components .",
    "our estimate for the northern hemisphere contact binaries of 59% @xmath1 8% is consistent with tokovinin s results within the statistical errors , but is slightly higher .",
    "this may indicate that the frequency keeps on increasing for shorter periods , but that the underlying physical causes for periods @xmath115 days may be similar .",
    "we note that the main route for detection of companions is the small angular separation on the sky . among the 64 positive detections ,",
    "46 systems are known visual , previously cataloged wds and hipparcos binaries or new discoveries of the new cfht , adaptive - optics ir observations ; the latter nicely complemented the extant data for m - dwarf companions at angular separations of about 0.1 arcsec to a few arcsec . in turn , most of the spectroscopic detections have been of systems already known as visual binaries ; spectroscopy can , however , help in determining the physical characteristics of the companion and firm up individual cases .",
    "the visual technique , combined with the parallax data permits to evaluate projected physical separations between the companions .",
    "the projected separations are moderate and are distributed in the range between 6 and @xmath116 au , or @xmath117 pc and 0.049 pc ( table  [ summary ] ) .",
    "figure  [ separ ] shows a histogram of the projected separations .",
    "the distribution may partly reflect observational biases , but it does show that the separations are much smaller than typical distances between stars in the solar neighborhood of about one parsec .",
    "thus , even the widest pairs with angular separations of several tens of arcsec can be regarded as gravitationally bound ; an example is aw  uma where for the angular separation of 67 arcsec , the projected separation is 4,400 au .",
    "but  physically  can these multiples be evolutionary connected at such disparate separations ranging between stellar sizes and thousands of au s ? can the kozai cycle work at such large distances or do we see now only the results of it acting well in the past ?",
    "answers to these exciting questions are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the approach that used is this paper was a straightforward one : we simply counted contact binaries which appeared to have companions .",
    "we totally disregarded the important matter of _ what are the companions and what would be the limitations in their detection_. some classes of stars , such as white dwarfs or neutron stars , would require utilization of special techniques ; some classes may be entirely undetectable .",
    "we leave these issues open for future investigations of this series .",
    "the use of several different observational techniques was certainly useful as none gives an unquestionable proof of multiplicity and each has its own biases and limitations .",
    "we used too many techniques to analyze selection effects of each ; such in - depth studies of biases for each technique would inflate the study and would probably not be warranted at this preliminary stage .",
    "but we know that biases are important : taking the astrometric data for the 50 best observed systems in the whole sky brighter than @xmath3 ( section  [ direct ] , figure  [ visual ] ) , we see a frequency of 40% @xmath1 9% , but this number would rise to 46% @xmath1 10% if we disregarded the magnitude limit and argued that objects best observed astrometrically would provide an even more reliable sample ( indeed , there are many bright systems with poor data ) .",
    "the sky location is also important : for the northern sub - sample of astrometrically well observed stars to @xmath3 , the frequency increases from 40% @xmath1 9% to 50% @xmath1 10% . similarly , entirely independent indications for the 20 best observed systems for the lite suggest 60% @xmath1 17% ; among those lite solutions , among these only two are for nominally southern systems , although both were observed from the north ( er  ori with @xmath118 and ux  eri with @xmath119 ) .    the most obvious observational bias caused by the brightness of the system is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ multi ] , where the fraction of detections is plotted for all systems brighter than the given magnitude rank .",
    "while for systems brighter than @xmath9 = 9 mag we see an almost constant fraction of multiples , there is a small but definite decrease of detections for fainter systems .",
    "in addition to in - depth analyzes of selection effects and biases of individual techniques , we issue the usual plea to the observers : more data are needed ! what is particularly needed are photometric data in standard systems . if not for the hipparcos mission , which led to many discoveries of contact binaries and if not for the photometric part of the tycho project , many contact binaries would be unknown or without most elementary data on color indices .",
    "all contact systems require also radial velocity spectroscopic support .",
    "the situation with the southern sky is particularly grave .",
    "there exists no spectroscopic survey similar to that being conducted now for short - period northern binaries at ddo so that even relatively bright southern contact binaries ( ty  men , de  oct , mw  pav , cn  hyi , wy  hor , v386  pav , etc . )",
    "still await spectroscopy or even conventional precision photometry .",
    "very few southern binaries are followed over time to provide lite information . for many binaries ,",
    "the last datum on the moment of minimum is the hipparcos @xmath120 .",
    "interesting southern systems omitted by hipparcos ( e.g. , br  mus , tv  mus or st  ind ) frequently have the last minima obtained a quarter or half a century ago .",
    "we point also that the technique of lunar occultations still remains to be fully utilized as it can provide angular resolution of about 2 mas and thus can be a powerful tool for the detection of close visual companions .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results : our best estimate of the lower limit to the triple star incidence among contact binaries appears to be 59 @xmath1 8% , as based on the northern sky to @xmath3 . we know that this limit may raise as suspected cases are analyzed more thoroughly .",
    "if , in addition to unquestionable detection of 64 multiple systems among 151 targets over the whole sky , all suspected 24 cases in table  [ summary ] were included as detections , then the frequency for the whole sky would increase from 42% @xmath1 5% to 56% @xmath1 6% , while that for the northern hemisphere alone it would reach 72% @xmath1 9% .",
    "our results are consistent with those for the magnitude - complete hipparcos sample to @xmath5 @xcite , with 17 multiples among 35 systems ( @xmath8% ) , although for that sample a large fraction of all systems were newly discovered eclipsing binaries with currently incomplete data . remembering that we could evaluate only a lower limit to the frequency of triple systems , and that some multiple systems are beyond reach of any current technique of detection , this number is not far from one indicating a possibility that all contact binaries originated in multiple systems .",
