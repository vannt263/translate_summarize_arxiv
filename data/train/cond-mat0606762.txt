    "transition metal oxides show a fascinating complex behavior in their electronic properties.@xcite this complexity stems from the interplay between the formation of narrow @xmath1-bands leading to a delocalization of these states on the one hand and the local part of the coulomb interaction between the @xmath1-electrons tending to localize them.@xcite while compounds of the early @xmath1 elements like e.g.  latio@xmath0 , which typically accommodate one @xmath1 electron , can at least qualitatively be described in terms of a one - band hubbard model@xcite , materials involving higher transition metal elements like lamno@xmath0 or tlsr@xmath2coo@xmath3 require the use of a model including the full @xmath1 shell . in particular , to understand the magnetic properties and the frequently occurring metal - insulator transitions@xcite one has to take into account the interplay between density- ( `` hubbard @xmath4 '' ) and exchange - type ( `` hund s @xmath5 '' ) contributions to the local coulomb interaction .",
    "note that similar features can also be found in compounds involving higher rare earth elements , for example the rare earth pnictides .",
    "a particularly interesting example is la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath0 .",
    "besides is complicated phase diagram comprising a large variety of paramagnetic and magnetically ordered metallic and insulating phases one finds a colossal magneto - resistance ( cmr).@xcite in this cubic perovskite the five - fold degenerate @xmath1 level is split by crystal field into three - fold degenerate @xmath8 , which have the lower energy , and two - fold degenerate @xmath9 states .",
    "these states have to be filled with @xmath10 electrons , nominally yielding a metal even for @xmath11 .",
    "however , taking into account the local coulomb interaction , three of these electrons will occupy the @xmath8-states forming an @xmath12 high - spin state due to hund s coupling , which interacts ferromagnetically with the electron occupying the @xmath9 states . ignoring the coulomb repulsion among the electrons in the @xmath9 subsystem , one encounters the well - known double - exchange model@xcite , which has been extensively studied as suitable model for manganites ( see e.g.  references in ref . ) . in most of these investigations , however , the @xmath8-spin was approximated by a classical moment to allow the use of standard techniques like e.g.  quantum monte - carlo@xcite ( qmc ) .",
    "without such a replacement , one is typically restricted to low - order diagrammatic techniques ( ref .",
    "and references therein ) .",
    "a more realistic treatment should of course also include the local coulomb interaction within the @xmath9 subsystem . such a model has been proposed recently@xcite and studied in the framework of the dynamical mean - field theory@xcite ( dmft ) .",
    "again , the @xmath8-spin had to be replaced by a classical moment to allow the solution of the dmft equations with qmc .    in this paper",
    "we want to study the validity of approximating the quantum spin by a classical object . to this end",
    ", we investigate the simplest possible model , viz a quantum impurity model consisting of a local orbital with interacting charge degrees of freedom coupled to a non - interacting host and a spin .",
    "while such a model surely can not access every aspect of the physics of the corresponding lattice model , it is the basic ingredient in a dmft calculation and thus understanding its fundamental properties is of importance to properly interpret results obtained in a dmft calculation .",
    "moreover , although such a calculation will focus on local dynamics only , one can obtain at least qualitative results about possible ordered phases , too.@xcite to this end it is viable to obtain a feeling how the additional spin will modify local charge and spin properties .",
    "we employ wilson s numerical renormalization group@xcite ( nrg ) to solve this model .",
    "this technique allows to treat the model in the whole parameter regime and in particular identify small energy scales if present .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the model and briefly review its properties for a classical spin in the limit of vanishing coulomb interaction .",
    "the presentation of our results follows in section iii .",
    "the paper closes with a summary and discussion .",
    "the simplest model that allows to obtain an idea how the coupling to an additional local spin - degree of freedom influences the properties of correlated electrons is @xmath13{l } \\displaystyle \\sum\\limits_{k\\sigma}\\epsilon_{k } c^\\dagger_{k\\sigma}c^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}_{k\\sigma } + \\sum\\limits_\\sigma \\left(\\epsilon_d+\\frac{u}{2}d^\\dagger_{-\\sigma}d^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}_{-\\sigma}\\right ) d^\\dagger_{\\sigma}d^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}_{\\sigma}\\\\[5 mm ] \\displaystyle + \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sum\\limits_{k\\sigma}\\left ( c^\\dagger_{k\\sigma}d^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}_{k\\sigma}+\\mbox{h.c.}\\right)\\\\[5 mm ] \\displaystyle -j_k\\sum\\limits_{\\alpha,\\beta } \\vec{s}\\cdot\\vec{s}_d\\;\\;. \\end{array}\\ ] ] the first three terms represent a conventional single - impurity anderson model,@xcite while the last contribution introduces an additional spin degree of freedom which couples to the local states via an exchange interaction .",
    "similar models have been studied with various techniques in connection with double quantum dots.@xcite however , in these cases the additional impurity was represented by a correlated charge degree of freedom coupled via a hopping . in the limit of half - filling and weak interimpurity hopping , this system maps to our model with @xmath14 and vanishing antiferromagnetic @xmath15 .",
    "this limit shows interesting physics on its own,@xcite for example two - stage kondo screening or quantum phase transitions .",
    "however , these models neither do allow for _ ferromagnetic _ @xmath15 , large and possibly anisotropic @xmath15 nor spins @xmath16 , which are the particular cases we are interested in here .",
    "of course our model ( [ eq : model ] ) does not fully represent the situation found in e.g.  lamno@xmath0 since it lacks the orbital degrees of freedom . on the other hand , nrg calculations for multi - orbital models",
    "are extremely expensive@xcite and we believe that as far as the qualitative aspects are concerned this simplification will not substantially modify the validity of our observations for the more complicated model .    for a classical spin @xmath17 , the model ( [ eq : model ] ) can be solved exactly for @xmath18.@xcite the result for the single - particle green function of the @xmath19 states is @xmath20 where @xmath21 and we assumed @xmath22 and a flat conduction density of states ( dos ) of infinite width and value @xmath23 .",
    "the resultant dos @xmath24 shows two peaks of width @xmath25 centered at @xmath26 .",
    "note that one can view this result as spin - averaged dos of the siam at @xmath18 in a magnetic field @xmath15 and that the result is independent of the sign of @xmath15 .",
    "neither for a quantum spin nor for a classical spin and @xmath27 an exact solution exists . however , it is tempting to extend the above interpretation for a classical spin in the following way : solve a standard siam in a magnetic field of @xmath15 and average over the resulting spectra for spin up and down .",
    "note that this procedure again leads to results that do not depend on the sign of @xmath15 .",
    "since the additional spin enters only on the local level , we use the standard nrg algorithm@xcite to solve the impurity problem and calculate physical quantities . to obtain reliable spectra in a magnetic field ,",
    "we furthermore employ the technique proposed by hofstetter.@xcite since a discretization of the energy axis introduced in the nrg leads to discrete spectra , a broadening must be introduced to obtain smooth results for dynamical quantities .",
    "again , we follow the standard procedure here.@xcite    as example we present in fig .  [",
    "fig : compising ] calculations for the     and `` classical '' spin @xmath28 . for the latter results for both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic coupling are shown .",
    "the inset displays an enlarged view of the region around @xmath29 .",
    "the dashed black curve is the result for @xmath30 and @xmath31.[fig : compising],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    siam in a magnetic field , averaged over the spin direction , together with results for the siam with additional ising respectively classical spin .",
    "the parameters for the siam are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , i.e. particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the nrg discretization parameter was @xmath34 and we kept @xmath35 states per iteration depending on the size of the local spin .",
    "the nrg - spectra finally were broadened with a width @xmath36 .    the black curve in fig .  [ fig : compising ]",
    "was obtained from a calculation with a magnetic field @xmath37 , the red curve with a local ising spin @xmath14 and coupling @xmath38 , the blue and magenta curves with local spin @xmath28 and couplings @xmath39 to simulate the classical limit @xmath40 .",
    "the values of @xmath15 were scaled such that @xmath41 .",
    "the inset shows an enlarged view of the region around @xmath29 ; for comparison , the dashed black curve represents the spectrum for @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "while the position of the hubbard bands at higher energies coincides for all curves , the distribution of spectral weight comes out different for @xmath42 compared to the case with magnetic field and @xmath30 .",
    "this deviation is a purely numerical effect related to the the differences in the distribution of spectral weight in the hubbard bands for the discrete nrg spectra with and without applied magnetic field and the broadening introduced to obtain smooth spectra .    in the region around @xmath29",
    "the calculation with ising spin and magnetic field coincide perfectly , yielding a splitting of the original kondo resonance at @xmath43 , as expected .",
    "however , the `` classical limit '' with @xmath28 differs considerably .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath15 , either a kondo resonance ( ferromagnetic coupling ) or a gap ( antiferromagnetic case ) emerges at @xmath29 in addition to the splitting of the original kondo peak . apparently , even for such a large value of @xmath44 the effect of quantum fluctuations is still prominent .",
    "however , the corresponding energy scales are considerably reduced compared to @xmath45 and we expect the results to converge to the anticipated one as @xmath40 .",
    "let us now turn to the discussion of the effects of a local quantum spin on the low - energy properties .     as function of @xmath46 .",
    "full ( dashed ) lines denote antiferromagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) coupling.[fig : two_stage],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : two_stage ] the impurity contribution to the entropy ( upper panel ) and the effective impurity moment @xmath47 ( lower panel ) for different values of @xmath15 for a local spin @xmath14 are shown as function of @xmath46 , where @xmath48 denotes the kondo scale for the system with @xmath30 .",
    "the siam parameters were @xmath49 at particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the nrg discretization , number of states kept etc .  were chosen as before .",
    "the full lines in fig .  [ fig : two_stage ] represent results for antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath50 , the dashed lines those for ferromagnetic coupling .    decreasing @xmath50 from @xmath51 to some antiferromagnetic @xmath52 results in the scenario depicted by the full red curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : two_stage ] . around the temperature @xmath48 screening occurs as in the normal kondo effect , resulting in a situation that resembles a free spin @xmath14 again . for a much lower @xmath53 ,",
    "a second screening takes place to the ground state with @xmath30 .",
    "this latter can be viewed as a conventional kondo screening of the local spin by the fully formed local fermi liquid .",
    "hence , the factors @xmath48 appearing in the formula for @xmath54 , representing the effective bandwidth respectively dos at the fermi level of the quasi - particles of the local fermi liquid playing the part of the `` conduction states '' .",
    "this effect has been observed before by several authors@xcite and baptized two - stage kondo screening .",
    "when @xmath50 becomes of the order of @xmath48 , the kondo screening is replaced by the formation of a local singlet with an energy scale @xmath55 .    for ferromagnetic coupling @xmath56 ,",
    "on the other hand , the proper fixed point is  as in the conventional kondo model ",
    "the local - moment one with residual entropy @xmath57 and effective moment @xmath58 . again , from the dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : two_stage ] one can distinguish two regimes . for @xmath59",
    "we observe screening on the scale of @xmath60 , the additional local spin effectively behaving like a free spin all the way down to @xmath61 .",
    "however , for @xmath62 the impurity first forms a local spin triplet ( entropy @xmath63 and moment @xmath64 ) .",
    "this moment is then partially screened at a reduced kondo scale @xmath65 ; energy scales and physical properties will behave as in the conventional underscreened kondo model.@xcite     as function of @xmath66 .",
    "the insets show the spectra for @xmath67 in a semi - logarithmic plot.[fig : dos_half],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the behavior discussed previously is reflected in the local density of states ( dos ) depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_half ] .",
    "as already noted in the classical limit , the coupling to the additional spin leads to a corresponding shift of the upper hubbard band , which however is for larger @xmath68 more pronounced for antiferromagnetic exchange . in this case on also nicely sees the two - stage screening at @xmath69 and the formation of the local singlet at @xmath70 ( inset to upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_half ] ) , suppressing the kondo screening . here",
    ", one always finds a gap in the dos at @xmath29 , which size is set by @xmath54 . for ferromagnetic coupling , on the other hand , the inset in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_half ] proves that the screening resonance remains intact , but shows a width decreasing with increasing @xmath50 .",
    "how does the behavior discussed in the previous section change with increasing spin quantum number @xmath71 or more precisely , do we recover a `` classical '' result for large enough @xmath71 ?",
    "let us start with a discussion of the weak - coupling results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_weak_c ] .     as function of @xmath66 in the weak - coupling regime @xmath72 for different values of local spin @xmath71 .",
    "the upper panel collects the results for antiferromagnetic coupling , the lower panel those for ferromagnetic .",
    "the insets show the spectra for @xmath67 in a semi - logarithmic plot.[fig : dos_weak_c],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the calculations were done in the weak - coupling regime @xmath72 for fixed value @xmath73 to achieve the same classical energy scale for all @xmath71 .",
    "we did calculations up to @xmath74 , which , according to our results in section [ subsec : classical ] , we expect to be already very close to the classical limit .",
    "indeed , for @xmath74 ( green curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : dos_weak_c ] ) we do find almost identical behavior for @xmath75 and @xmath56 except for extremely low temperatures .",
    "note however , that even for this large value for @xmath71 the dos for @xmath76 for @xmath75 does not reach the full unitary limit due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "the differences are more dramatic for small values of @xmath71 .",
    "as expected , for @xmath75 there occurs a kondo screening with an energy - scale @xmath77 decreasing exponentially with increasing @xmath71 .",
    "note that even for comparatively large @xmath78 the influence of quantum fluctuations is still pronounced and appears in an energy regime that may still be of experimental relevance .",
    "the differences become even more pronounced if we increase the local coulomb repulsion to @xmath79 , which lies in the intermediate - coupling regime with a kondo scale @xmath80 .",
    "since thus @xmath81 we do not expect two - stage screening here .",
    "the results for otherwise same model parameters are collected in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_inter_c ] .     as function of @xmath66 in the intermediate - coupling regime @xmath79 for different values of local spin @xmath71 .",
    "the upper panel collects the results for antiferromagnetic coupling , the lower panel those for ferromagnetic .",
    "the insets show the spectra for @xmath67 in a semi - logarithmic plot.[fig : dos_inter_c],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    note that due to the choice of @xmath50 the hubbard bands do not move with increasing @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , in all cases @xmath82 additional structures appear at @xmath83 .",
    "the low - energy behavior , however , is markedly different for @xmath75 ( upper panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_inter_c ] ) and @xmath56 ( lower panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_inter_c ] ) .",
    "below @xmath84 , the former case always develops a ( pseudo- ) gap due to the formation of a singlet between the local degrees of freedom , while the latter tends to recover a kondo - resonance for the total spin , again with exponentially decreasing @xmath85 . owing to the universal behavior of the conventional anderson model for @xmath86 ( `` kondo regime '' )",
    "we actually expect the behavior observed here to be generic in this parameter regime . quite obviously ,",
    "while in the weak coupling regime the `` classical limit '' is reached already for moderate values of @xmath71 , one has to be very careful when dealing with the strongly correlated regime .",
    "in this paper we presented calculations for an extended anderson impurity model , where the local charge degrees of freedom in addition couple to a localized spin . the motivation to study such a model",
    "is based on the observation that in a variety of transition metal or rare earth compounds the complex local orbital structure can be split into a localized spin , which can take large values @xmath87 , coupled via hund s exchange to a more delocalized set of possibly also correlated states .",
    "a particular example surely is the famous lamno@xmath0 .",
    "the solution of this model for different regimes of model parameters was accomplished by using wilson s nrg , which provides accurate and reliable results for thermodynamics and dynamics and is able to resolve arbitrarily small energy - scales that may appear in the problem .",
    "the findings can be summarized as follows : even for comparatively large localized spin @xmath74 , we still observe the influence of quantum fluctuations on the properties of the impurity charge degrees of freedom .",
    "these effects become more pronounced when these charge degrees of freedom are correlated themselves as to be expected for example in lamno@xmath0 . depending on the ratio @xmath88 , where @xmath60 is the kondo temperature for the model without additional spin , different regimes can be identified , which in contrast to the classical prediction do markedly depend on the sign of @xmath50 .",
    "thus , for the solution of correlated lattice models with such an additional spin degree of freedom within dmft one has to be likely careful when using the approximation of a classical spin , even when @xmath71 is comparatively large .",
    "moreover , the expected physics can be read off our results right away , at least for half - filling . due to the reduced kondo scale for hund s type or ferrmomagnetic coupling",
    ", we expect a corresponding reduction of a critical @xmath4 for a mott - hubbard transition . on the other hand , for antiferromagnetic exchange coupling the corresponding @xmath89 at @xmath61 , because the forming of a local singlet immediately leads to an insulating state .",
    "quite interesting are also the magnetic properties of the system .",
    "again , we may anticipate from the impurity calculations that antiferromagnetism is still the prevailing magnetic order , but in the vicinity of certain commensurate band fillings we can also expect ferromagnetic order from a corresponding rkky exchange .",
    "these inverstigations are currently in progress .",
    "we acknowledge useful conversations with m.  vojta , a.  lichtenstein , r.  bulla , f.  anders and d.  vollhardt .",
