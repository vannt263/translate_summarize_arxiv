    "the geodesic principle in general relativity ( gr ) states that free massive test point particles traverse timelike geodesics .",
    "it has long been believed that , given the other central postulates of gr , the geodesic principle can be proved as a theorem . in our view , though previous attempts were highly suggestive , the sense in which the geodesic principle is a theorem of gr was finally clarified by bob geroch and pong soo jang .",
    "they proved the following ( the statement of which is indebted to ( * ? ? ? * prop .",
    "2.5.2 ) ) :    [ gj ] _",
    "( * @xcite * ) _ let @xmath0 be a relativistic spacetime , with @xmath1 orientable .",
    "let @xmath2 be a smooth , imbedded curve .",
    "suppose that given any open subset @xmath3 of @xmath1 containing @xmath4 $ ] , there exists a smooth symmetric field @xmath5 with the following properties .    1 .   [ sdec ]",
    "@xmath5 satisfies the _ strengthened dominant energy condition _ , i.e. given any future - directed timelike covector @xmath6 at any point in @xmath1 , @xmath7 and either @xmath8 or @xmath9 is timelike ; 2 .",
    "[ cons]@xmath5 satisfies the _ conservation condition _ , i.e. @xmath10 ; 3 .",

    "[ non - vanishing]there is at least one point in @xmath3 at which @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath13 is a timelike curve that can be reparametrized as a geodesic .",
    "the interpretation of the geroch - jang theorem can be put as follows : if @xmath13 is a smooth curve about which it is possible to construct an arbitrarily small matter field satisfying the conservation and strict dominant energy conditions , then @xmath13 can be reparametrized as a timelike geodesic .",
    "more roughly , the only curves about which matter can propagate are timelike geodesics .    the geroch - jang approach has many virtues that previous attempts lacked:@xcite ( 1 ) geroch and jang do not make any specific assumptions about the kinds of matter fields that might compose the free massive test point particle ( i.e. they do not need to assume it is a perfect fluid or a dust , etc . ) , aside from general assumptions that _ any _ body in gr would be expected to satisfy ; ( 2 ) geroch and jang are able to show that a free massive test point particle traverses a curve _ within spacetime _ , as opposed to a `` line singularity '' ; and ( 3 ) geroch and jang do not need to make simplifying assumptions regarding the mass multi - pole structure of their test objects .    in so - called `` geometrized newtonian gravitation '' ( sometimes , `` newton - cartan theory '' ) , a reformulation of newtonian gravitation first developed in the 1920s by lie cartan@xcite and kurt friedrichs,@xcite with substantial later contributions by ehlers,@xcite knzle,@xcite and trautman,@xcite ( see ( * ? ? ? * ch .",
    "4 ) for an extensive list of references ) the motion of a free massive test point particle is again governed by a geodesic principle .",
    "but thus far , little attention has been paid to the question of whether here , too , the geodesic principle has the status of a theorem .",
    "the central result of the present paper ( theorem [ w ] ) is that a direct parallel to the geroch - jang theorem does hold in geometrized newtonian gravitation.at least , the geroch - jang theorem and theorem [ w ] of this paper are directly parallel mathematically .",
    "there is a second kind of question that one might ask , concerning the interpretations of the two theorems in the contexts of their respective spacetime theories .",
    "for instance , one might wonder if the conservation condition is as natural an assumption in geometrized newtonian gravitation as in gr .",
    "we do not address such questions here , but will return to them in future work . ] it is worth noting that in the course of proving the geodesic principle as a theorem of geometrized newtonian gravitation , we prove a lemma that can be understood as a proof of newton s first law ( appropriately reformulated in covariant , four dimensional language ) in non - geometrized newtonian gravitation .",
    "thus we show that the principles governing inertial motion in both standard newtonian theory and geometrized newtonian gravitation are dependent on the other principles of the theory , just as in gr .",

    "the main results of the paper will be presented in section [ sec - theorem ] , followed by some concluding remarks in section [ sec - conclusion ] .",
    "a brief review of geometrized newtonian gravitation is given in appendix [ sec - n - c_theory ] ; appendix [ sec - integration ] describes some elementary results concerning integration in classical spacetimes that , to our knowledge , have not been considered before and so are offered for completeness . finally , appendix [ sec - proofs ] contains proofs of some of the preliminary propositions and lemmas given in sections [ sec - prelimmath ] and [ sec - theorem ] .",

    "we also take for granted some facts and conventions about orientation , volume elements , and hypersurfaces that are described in appendix [ sec - integration ] .",
    "finally , we will explicitly indicate that various fields are smooth in the statements of lemmas and theorems , but throughout the supporting discussion , we will at times take for granted than any object that is a candidate for smoothness is indeed smooth .    for any manifold @xmath18",
    ", we will denote the space of all smooth tensor fields on @xmath18 by @xmath19 ; the space of smooth contravariant fields on @xmath18 will be @xmath20 and the smooth covariant fields on @xmath18 will be @xmath21 .",

    "the ( local ) existence of such a field in a spatially flat ( @xmath72 ) classical spacetime is in fact equivalent to @xmath68 .",
    "thus , without the curvature condition , our construction fails .",
    "that said , it is quite likely ( we believe ) that a different argument can be given to show that an appropriate derivative operator does exist more generally , in which case it would be possible to relax the curvature condition in theorem [ w ] .    to evaluate whether this curvature condition is a defect of the present argument , however , one needs to consider the status of this condition in the context of the geometrized newtonian gravitation .",
    "the condition is necessary to recover standard newtonian gravitation from the geometrized theory ( see appendix [ sec - n - c_theory ] ) . without it ,",
    "it is possible to find a more general `` newtonian '' theory ( see @xcite ) , but with a vector potential replacing the scalar potential of standard newtonian gravitation , and with a universal rotation field affecting the behavior of this vector potential .",
    "we would like to note , however , that insofar as we were interested in the status of the geodesic principle in _",
    "physics ( rather than in some generalized newtonian physics ) , @xmath68 is a perfectly reasonable requirement : it holds just in case a geometrized newtonian spacetime admits a standard newtonian representation .",
    "it is part of what makes a classical spacetime newtonian .",
    "the second difference is that the present result assumes the underlying manifold @xmath1 be simply connected ; the geroch - jang theorem , however , does not seem to require any such global topological assumptions .",
    "the reason that simple - connectedness is required here is that vector integration in a classical spacetime , at least as we have developed it , requires simple connectedness to ensure a unique result for the integral ( since otherwise , parallel transport is not necessarily globally unique ) .",
    "geroch and jang use killing fields to avoid this problem entirely ; however , in a classical spacetime one does not have access to timelike killing fields , even locally or in flat spacetime .",
    "however , there is a simple corollary available that ( partially ) extends the result to a more general case .",
    "[ w1 ] let @xmath14 be a classical spacetime , and suppose that @xmath1 is oriented .",

    "@xmath70 , meanwhile , can be thought of as a spatial metric .",
    "however , since there is no way to lower the indices of @xmath70 , we can not calculate the spatial length of a vector directly .",

    "note that this condition is equivalent to saying that , again on @xmath13 , @xmath360 .    as stated above , it is also necessary that @xmath350 obtain .",

    "we claim that there is a field that meets both conditions . for any spacelike hypersurface @xmath24 slicing the spatial convex hull of @xmath5 , let @xmath349 be the vector field one finds by parallel transporting ( relative to @xmath15 ) the vector @xmath361 at the point where @xmath13 intersects @xmath24 to all other points of @xmath24 ( this construction can not produce ambiguities because we have assumed spatial flatness , and thus parallel transport in space is always path - independent , at least in a simply connected manifold ) .",
