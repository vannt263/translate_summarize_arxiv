    "although ngc  6752 is one of the nearest clusters , there is no consensus in the literature on its dynamical status .",
    "it was initially classified as a post - core collapse ( pcc ) by djorgovski & king ( 1986 , hereafter dk86 ) and auriere & ortolani ( 1989 , hereafter ao89 ) .",
    "later lugger , cohn & grindlay ( 1995 , hereafter lcg95 ) argued that the radial profile was not inconsistent with a king model .",
    "as part of a project devoted to the study the characteristics of globulars harboring millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , we present a new determination of the center of gravity (  3 ) and of the star density profile (  4 ) of ngc  6752 both based on new high - resolution and wide - field observations . by coupling the superior resolution of hst with the imaging capability of the wide field camera ( wfi ) mounted at the 2.2 m eso - mpi telescope , we have obtained the most accurate and extended radial profile ever published for this cluster . after modeling these data (  5 )",
    "we examine the dynamical status of the cluster (  6 ) .",
    "recently , observations of @xmath3 and location of five millisecond pulsars in ngc  6752 ( damico et al . 2002 ) have suggested a surprisingly high mass - to - light ratio @xmath4 in its core and the occurrence of non thermal dynamics in the inner regions ( see colpi , possenti & gualandris 2002 ) . the determination of @xmath4 by damico et al . relied on results of pulsar timing and published optical data derived from medium resolution ground based observation only .",
    "taking advantage from our new optical data , we re - examine in  7 the damico et al .",
    "measurement , discussing the possibile origin and the consequences of the observed values of @xmath3 at some length .",
    "the photometric data used here consist of two sets : _ ( i)high resolution set_a series of hst- wfpc2 images was obtained in march 2001 , through the f555w ( @xmath5 ) and f336w ( @xmath6 ) filters as part of a long term project ( go-8709 , pi : f. r. ferraro ) aimed to study the central stellar populations in a set of galactic globular glusters ( ggcs ) . in this dataset the planetary camera ( pc , which has the highest resolution @xmath7 )",
    "was roughly centered on the cluster center while the wide field ( wf ) cameras ( at lower resolution @xmath8 ) sampled the surrounding outer regions ; _ ( ii)wide field set_a complementary set of multi - filter ( @xmath9 , @xmath5 , @xmath10 ) wide field images was secured during an observing run at the 2.2 m eso - mpi telescope at eso ( la silla ) in july 1999 , using the wide field imager ( wfi ) .",
    "the wfi has exceptional imaging capabilities  the image consists of a mosaic of 8 ccd chips ( each with a field of view of @xmath11 ) giving a global field of view of @xmath12 .",
    "the cluster was roughly centered on chip @xmath13 .",
    "the raw wfi images were corrected for bias and flat field , and the over - scan region was trimmed using standard iraf tools .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) fitting procedure was performed independently on each @xmath5 and @xmath9 images , using daophot ii ( stetson 1994 ) .",
    "a final catalog listing the instrumental @xmath14 magnitudes for all the stars in each field has been obtained by cross - correlating the @xmath9 and @xmath5 catalogs .",
    "the wfi catalog was finally calibrated by using the data - set of buonanno et al .",
    "( 1986 ) .",
    "the photometric reductions of the high resolution images were carried out using romafot ( buonanno et al .",
    "1983 ) , a package developed to perform accurate photometry in crowded fields and specifically optimized to handle under - sampled psf ( buonanno & iannicola 1989 ) as in the case of the hst - wf chips .",
    "psf - fitting instrumental magnitudes have been obtained using the standard procedure described in ferraro et al .",
    "( 1997a , 2001 ) .",
    "the final catalog of the f555w and f336w magnitudes was calibrated by using the zero - points listed by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "the recently released _",
    "guide star catalog _ ( @xmath15 ) was used to search for astrometric standards in the entire wfi image field of view .",
    "several hundred astrometric @xmath15 reference stars were found in each chip , allowing an accurate absolute positioning of the sources .",
    "an astrometric solution has been obtained for each of the 8 wfi chips independently , by using a procedure developed at the bologna observatory ( montegriffo et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) . at the end of the entire procedure ,",
    "the rms residuals were of the order of @xmath16 both in ra and dec .    the small field ( @xmath17 on the side ) of the high resolution wfpc2/hst images was entirely contained within the field of view of the wfi chip @xmath13 , which imaged the central part of the cluster .",
    "thus we used more than 1200 bright stars in the wfi catalog lying in the wfpc2-fov as _ secondary astrometric standards _ in order to properly find an astrometric solution for the wfpc2 catalog .",
    "we estimate that the global uncertainty in the astrometric procedure is less than @xmath18 both in ra and dec . at the end of the procedure the two catalogs ( wfpc2 and wfi ) have a fully homogeneous absolute coordinate system .",
    "the two lists were then matched together : stars in the overlapping area were used to recheck the homogeneity of the calibration of the @xmath5-magnitude ( which is used to construct the surface profile ) in the two catalogs . to do this the hst f555w band",
    "was transformed into the johnson @xmath5 system and a homogeneous list of @xmath5 magnitudes and absolute coordinates for the sources in the hst and the wfi catalogs was produced . in order to avoid strong selection effects due to possible incompleteness of the samples ( in particular the wfi catalog ) , we grouped the two samples as follows : _ ( 1 ) hst sample : _ all stars in the wfpc2 fov with @xmath19 and @xmath20 from the cluster center ; _ ( 2 ) wfi sample : _ all the stars in the wfi fov with @xmath19 and @xmath21 from the cluster center .",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) derived from these samples are shown in figure  [ cmd ] .",
    "the first step toward the computation of the density profile is the determination of the center of gravity @xmath22 of the cluster . in doing this , we estimated the position of the geometrical center of the star distribution taking advantage from the knowledge of the exact star positions even in the innermost central region .",
    "we applied the procedure described in montegriffo et al .",
    "( 1995 ) which computed @xmath22 by simply averaging the @xmath23 and @xmath24 coordinates of stars lying in the pc camera of the hst catalog .",
    "@xmath22 is located at @xmath25 with a typical @xmath26 uncertainty of @xmath27 in both @xmath28 and @xmath29 , corresponding to about @xmath30 pixels in the wfpc2/hst images .",
    "ao89 derived the @xmath22 by using the barycenter of the bright ( @xmath31 ) resolved stars from ground based observations .",
    "we transformed the center position in their figure 3 , into our coordinate system .",
    "it well agrees with our determination , being located only @xmath32 s.    the coordinates of the cluster center previously reported in the literature refer mostly to the center of luminosity @xmath33 , which is usually determined by the so - called _ mirror autocorrelation _",
    "( see djorgovski 1988 ) .",
    "@xmath22 turns out to be @xmath34 s and @xmath32 e of the @xmath33 reported in the djorgovski ( 1993 ) compilation .",
    "such a difference is not surprising ",
    "similar offsets have been found in other clusters ( see for example 47 tucanae ",

    "; m80ferraro et al",
    ". 1999a ) .",
    "figure  [ map ] shows the central @xmath35 of the cluster with respect to the @xmath36 determined in this work ( marked in figure with a large cross at @xmath37 ) .",
    "the center position by ao89 ( _ small cross _ labeled with ao ) and by djorgovski ( 1993 ; _ small cross _ labeled with d ) are also indicated .",
    "pooley et al . ( 2002 ) noticed that the highest concentration of x - ray sources detected by _",
    "chandra _ in a 30 ksec pointing toward ngc  6752 appeared surprisingly displaced with respect to the optical center by djorgovski ( 1988 ) . on the contrary , figure  [ map ]",
    "shows that our value of @xmath22 lies close to the barycenter of the nine more central objects ( marked in figure [ map ] with a large cross labeled with xrs at coordinates ( @xmath38 ) , reconciling their projected positions with an almost spherical distribution .",
    "by using the combined data set shown in figure [ cmd ] we computed star density and surface brightness profiles applying the standard procedure fully described in calzetti et al .",
    "1993 ( see also ferraro et al .",
    "1999a , paltrinieri et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the entire photometric sample has been divided in 35 concentric annuli centered on @xmath22 , spanning a spatial range from @xmath39 to @xmath40 ; each annulus has been in turn split in a number of sub - sectors ( generally octants or quadrants depending on the shape of the fov covered by the hst and wfi fields ) .",
    "the surface brightness of each sub - sector has been evaluated as the sum of the luminosity of all the stars lying in it , divided by the area ( expressed in @xmath41 ) .",
    "the average and the rms over the brightness of the sub - sectors determine the value and the uncertainty of the surface brightness of an annulus .",
    "however , evaluating the brightness over small regions can suffer by large fluctuations due to small number statistics of few bright giants .",
    "hence , we computed three radial profiles , removing the stars brighter than @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ brightness ] shows that the overall structure of the profile does not change with the adopted magnitude limit .",
    "in contrast , the rms between sub - sectors significantly decreases once the brightest stars are excluded .",
    "the brightness profile by ao89 is shown ( as open circles ) for comparison in the lower panel of figure  [ brightness ] .",
    "the agreement with the results of this work is excellent , although their profile is slightly fainter in the very central region , probably due to the incompleteness of their sample .",
    "this might be due to the fact that removal of the giants can lead to an unintentional subtraction of the contribution of close , fainter stars , which are often unresolved in ground - based observations .",
    "we can take advantage from the fact that we resolve the stars even in the innermost region of the cluster and directly produce a star density profile .",
    "as noted by lcg95 , a star density profile is not affected by the statistical fluctuations caused by the bright stars , and it is the most robust mean for determining the cluster structure parameters . once the photometric sample has been divided in annuli and sub - sectors , the number of stars lying within each sub - sector has been counted and averaged . star density has been eventually obtained by dividing the average star number by the area of the sub - sector ( expressed in @xmath43 ) .",
    "the star density profile values obtained from this procedure are listed in table 1 .",
    "this is the most complete and extended density profile ever published for this cluster , since it samples the cluster population from the very inner region out to @xmath44 from the cluster center .",
    "usually ggcs are considered core - collapsed or not depending on how well their radial distribution of stars is fitted by king ( 1966 ) profiles ( trager et al .",
    "these models are characterized by two parameters , the core radius , @xmath45 , and the tidal radius , @xmath46 , or , alternatively , the concentration @xmath47 . as stated by meylan & heggie ( 1997 , hereafter mh97 ) a more general rule",
    "is that all clusters with a concentration parameter @xmath482.5 can be considered as collapsed , on the verge of collapsing or just beyond the collapse .    in order to reproduce the observed profile",
    ", we obtained the surface density by projecting the star density from a standard isotropic , single - mass king - model derived using the code described in sigurdsson & phinney ( 1995 ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ dens1 ] . as can be seen",
    ", a king model which properly fits the outer region significantly overestimates the star density over an extended inner region ( @xmath49@xmath50 ) .",
    "this fit closely resembles the result obtained by lcg95 who fitted the @xmath6-band surface brightness profile for @xmath51 with a @xmath52 king model ( see their figure _ 2r _ ) . on the basis of that fit",
    ", they concluded that the cluster is not required to be in a post - core collapse state because the model did not differ from the data in a statistically significant way .",
    "however , there were aspects of the fit which led us to explore other possibilities .",
    "these included the bad fit in the region @xmath53 and the fact that even in the outer parts there are regions where the data line systematically above or below the observed points .",
    "we suspected that unmodeled effects were degrading this fit .",
    "for this reason , we searched for alternative solutions .",
    "as shown in figure [ density ] the density profile can be well fit by a dual king model .",
    "the outer cluster ( @xmath54 ) is well fit by a model with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the observed counts are significantly in excess of this model within the central @xmath57 . in this innermost region a king model with @xmath58 and @xmath59 fits the data , but lies significantly below all of the points with @xmath54 .",
    "a dual king model does not represent a detailed equilibrium of cluster structure .",
    "however , it is consistent with the scenario in which the central regions have evolved away from a global king model that now only characterizes the outer regions .    this anomalous structure of the innermost radial profile of ngc  6752 has been evident since the very first studies ( da costa 1979 ) .",
    "the @xmath6-band data presented by dk86 showed a sharp shoulder in the radial profile and prompted the authors to classify ngc  6752 as a core - collapsed cluster .",
    "a few years later , ao89 modeled their detailed @xmath5-band profile with a power law in the region between @xmath60 and @xmath61 from the center , noting a significant flattening for @xmath62 .",
    "lcg95 used also a modified power - law ( see their eq .",
    "3 , also reported in figure [ powerlaw ] ) , in order to test the presence of resolved cores .",
    "we used the inner part of the star density profile of figure [ density ] to repeat an analysis similar to that presented by lcg95 .",
    "besides a normalization factor , their expression is a function of two free parameters : the power - law index @xmath23 and the scale - length of the core @xmath63 , which can be easily converted in the usual @xmath45 ( see their eq .",
    "2 ) . as can be seen in figure [ powerlaw ] a proper fit ( with @xmath64 for @xmath65 d.o.f ) can be obtained , yielding @xmath66 ( corresponding to a core radius @xmath67 ) and @xmath68 ( @xmath26 errors ) .",
    "these values are consistent with the previous results by lcg95 ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) and by ao89 , who estimated a radius of the central plateau of @xmath71 ( from the analysis of their images ) and @xmath72 ( from the brightness density profile ) . at a distance of @xmath73 kpc ( ferraro et al .",
    "1999b ) , the core radius we inferred corresponds to a physical dimension of @xmath74 pc .",
    "the significant deviation of the star number density profile from a canonical king model is a clear indication that the innermost region ngc  6752 has experienced ( or is experiencing ) a collapse phase .",
    "unfortunately , no similarly unambiguous signature is available for differentiating the in- and post - core collapse state ( meylan & heggie 1997 ) .",
    "however , in favorable cases the phase of the collapse can be evaluated from indirect evidence .",
    "our results solidify the earlier suggestions of post - core collapse bounce made by ao89 .",
    "post - core collapse clusters are expected to undergo large amplitude oscillations in core size due to the gravothermal instability of collisional systems ( e.g. cohn et al . 1991 ) .",
    "the oscillating core spends most of the time at near maximum size and a radial extension of @xmath75 pc is consistent with the maximum radius of the core predicted by the models of post - core collapse bounce .",
    "the parameter most commonly used in theoretical studies is the ratio of core radius to half - mass radius , @xmath76 . using our value of @xmath77 and the half - mass radius of @xmath78 from trager et al ( 1995 )",
    ", we find a ratio @xmath79 . for comparison ,",
    "the multi - mass fokker - planck models for the post - collapse evolution of m15 presented by grabhorn et al ( 1992 , see their fig .",
    "5 ) reach a comparable value of @xmath80 during the maximally expanded state of the most extreme core bounces .",
    "the inclusion of primordial binaries in monte carlo simulations by fregeau et al ( 2003 ) results in an even wider range of predicted @xmath76 in the post - collapse phase .",
    "furthermore , we have found that there is an intermediate region in the composite density profile of ngc  6752 which is well represented by a power law profile with a slope @xmath81 compatible with the steepness predicted by single mass models of expanding bouncing cores ( lcg95 ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that ngc  6752 has apparently retained a substantial primordial binary population ( rubenstein & bailyn , 1997 ) ; these binaries may play an important role in supporting the core and delaying the core - collapse event . in this respect ,",
    "ferraro et al ( 1999a ) have suggested that some species originated from binary evolution could be used as possible tracers of the cluster dynamical evolution . in particular ,",
    "the large bss population recently found in m80 by ferraro et al ( 1999a ) might be the signature of a transient dynamical state , during which stellar interactions are delaying the core - collapse process leading to an exceptionally large population of _",
    "on the other hand the bss population found in the central region of ngc  6752 is small ( ferraro et al 2003 , in preparation ) perhaps indicating that ngc  6752 is in a different dynamical evolutionary state than m80 .",
    "maybe the binary population in ngc  6752 has not been `` burned out '' producing collisional bss while that in m80 has .",
    "ngc  6752 hosts 5 known millisecond pulsars ( damico et al . 2001a ; damico et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the positions in the plane of the sky of three of them ( psrs b , d and e , all isolated pulsars ) are close to the cluster center , as expected on the basis of mass segregation in the cluster . in particular psr - b and e",
    "show large _ negative _ values of @xmath82 , implying that the pulsars are experiencing an acceleration with a line - of - sight component @xmath83 directed toward the observer and a magnitude significantly larger than the positive component of @xmath82 due to the intrinsic pulsar spin - down ( see e.g. phinney 1992 ) .",
    "what is the origin of such acceleration ? given the location of ngc  6752 in the galactic halo and knowing its proper motion ( dinescu et al .",
    "1999 ) , it is possible to calculate the contributions to @xmath82 due to centrifugal acceleration , differential galactic rotation and vertical acceleration in the galactic potential , all of them resulting negligible ( damico et al .",
    "hence , the remaining plausible explanations of the observed negative @xmath82 are : the accelerating effect of the cluster gravitational potential well or the presence of some close perturbator(s ) exerting a gravitational pull onto the pulsars . taking advantage from the new results presented in this paper we discuss in the follow viability and implications of these two possibilities .",
    "the hypothesis that the line - of - sight acceleration of the msps with negative @xmath82 is dominated by the cluster gravitational potential has been routinely applied to many globulars . in particular from this assumption a lower limit to the mean projected mass - to - light ratio in the @xmath5-band @xmath4 in the central region of m15 ( phinney 1992 ) and 47 tucanae ( freire et al .",
    "2003 ) , yielded @xmath4@xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively . following phinney ( 1992 ) , a lower limit to @xmath86 in the inner regions of ngc  6752 is given by      where @xmath88 is the mean surface brightness within a line of sight subtended by an angle @xmath89 with respect to the cluster center and @xmath90 is the mass enclosed in the cylindrical volume of radius @xmath91 this equation holds to within @xmath9210% in all plausible cluster models and is independent of cluster distance , except for the effects of extinction . since @xmath93 is very small for ngc  6752 (= 0.04 according to harris 1996 ) the latter is a negligibe affect for this cluster .",
    "using the observed @xmath94 of psr - b and psr - e ( damico et al .",
    "2002 ) , combined with our accurate determinations of @xmath22 ( the cluster center of gravity ) and @xmath95 ( the mean surface brightness radial profile ) , it turns out that @xmath967 ( see figure [ mtol ] ) for the case of ngc  6752 .",
    "damico et al .",
    "( 2002 ) obtained a slightly larger @xmath97 using published values of @xmath22 and @xmath95 derived from medium resolution ground based observations only .",
    "the difference between the two estimates is mainly due to our new position of the cluster center of gravity . despite a residual uncertainty @xmath98 on @xmath99 under the hypothesis that the line - of - sight acceleration of psr - b and psr - e are entirely due to the cluster gravitational potential , a lower limit of @xmath100 can be firmly established .",
    "it is obtained assuming that the two millisecond pulsars were just symmetrically located ( and hence at the minimum projected distance ) with respect to the actual center of gravity .",
    "the sample of the core collapsed clusters shows typical values of the projected central mass - to - light ratio in the interval 23.5 ( pryor & meylan 1993 ) , although larger @xmath101 ratios can be obtained when a fokker ",
    "planck model fit is used ( e.g. the case of m15 dull et al .",
    "1997 , 2003 ) .",
    "if we take @xmath102 the expected total mass located within the inner @xmath103 pc of ngc  6752 ( equivalent to the projected displacement of psr - b from @xmath22 ) would be @xmath104@xmath105 on the other hand , the observed @xmath4@xmath1067 implies the existence of further @xmath107@xmath108 of low - luminosity matter segregated inside the projected radius @xmath109 this extra amount of mass could be constituted by a relatively massive black hole , like the @xmath110 black hole in the center of the globular cluster m15 recently proposed by gerssen et al .",
    "however , the results presented in  4 and  5 show that there are significant differences in the kinematics and mass distributions of the central regions of m15 and ngc  6752 ( we note here that because the distance to ngc  6752 is less than half that to m15 , its inner core is more easily studied ) : _ ( 1 . ) _ hst imaging of m15 ( guhathakurta et al . 1996wfpc2 ; sosin & king 1997foc ) shows no evidence for a compact core , at variance with our observations of the core of ngc  6752 ; _ ( 2 . ) _ the derived stellar density profiles of m15 have power law slopes consistent with @xmath111 ( expected from single mass models with a dominant central black hole ;",
    "if a @xmath112 black hole resides in the inner region of ngc  6752 , its gravitational influence would extend more than @xmath113 from the center of the cluster and probably produce a central power - law cusp , which we do not observe .",
    "a very high @xmath1147 could be also due to central concentration of dark remnants of stellar evolution , like neutron stars ( nss ) and heavy @xmath115 white dwarfs ( wds ) ( as also proposed for m15 by dull et al .",
    "1997 , 2003 and by baumgardt et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this case",
    ", one can constrain the initial mass function ( imf ) and/or the neutron star retention fraction @xmath116 in ngc  6752 .",
    "based on the current population of turn - off stars ( in the mass interval @xmath117@xmath118 ) , the estimated number of upper main sequence initially present in ngc  6752 is @xmath119 ( damico et al .",
    "this assumes a salpeter - like imf ( @xmath120 which is consistent with that measured by ferraro et al .",
    "if the low - luminosity matter observed in the central 0.08 pc were entirely due to @xmath121 nss of @xmath122 , then @xmath123% ( a reasonable value for collapsed clusters [ drukier 1996 ] ) .",
    "alternatively , @xmath114@xmath124 can be explained by a salpeter imf if @xmath125% of the total population of heavy @xmath126-wds sank into the ngc  6752 core during the cluster dynamical evolution .",
    "either scenario must also be consistent with the observed shape of the star density profile .    according to cohn ( 1985 ) , during the core collapse phase the surface density slope for the most massive component",
    "is expected to be @xmath127 rather than the projected isothermal slope of @xmath128 . in the central cusp that forms during core collapse ,",
    "the surface density slope of a component of stellar mass @xmath129 is given approximately by :      where @xmath131 is the stellar mass of the dominant component .",
    "if the luminosity profile is dominated by turnoff stars of mass @xmath132 and has a slope of @xmath133 , then the implied mass of the dominant , nonluminous component should be @xmath134 , i.e. somewhat more massive than the adopted turnoff mass .",
    "this argument does suggest that the central gravitational potential is not likely to be dominated by a large number of neutron stars , but heavy white dwarfs still remain a possibility .",
    "velocity dispersions provide a further constraint on the nature of the cluster potential well .",
    "the stars dominating the dynamics in the inner part of the cluster should have ( see eq .",
    "3.5 of phinney 1992 ) a 1-dimensional central velocity dispersion @xmath135@xmath136 .",
    "this is compatible both with the very wide published @xmath137 interval for the @xmath138 of ngc  6752 ( @xmath139@xmath140 , dubath , meylan & mayor 1997 ) and with preliminary proper motion measurements of stars in the central part of ngc  6752 , which would suggest a significantly higher one - dimension velocity dispersion @xmath141 and the existence of strong velocity anisotropies ( drukier et al .",

    "this is also marginally compatibile ( given the @xmath145% uncertainty of the formula 3.5 of phinney 1992 ) .",
    "ngc  6752 is a highly concentrated cluster and its core could host @xmath146 stars per cubic pc ( assuming an average stellar mass of @xmath147 ) . hence close star - star encounters are a viable possibility . in order to produce the line - of - sight acceleration @xmath148 seen in psr - b ( or psr - e ) a passing - by star of mass @xmath149 must approach the pulsar at @xmath150 pc .",
    "an upper limit to the probability of occurrence of a suitable close encounter can be roughly estimated as @xmath151 although this figure is not negliglible , the need of having two different canonical stars independently exerting their gravitational pull onto psr - b and psr - e , makes the joint probability of such configuration suspiciously low , @xmath152 . rather than being randomly placed",
    "could the perturber be a binary companion to the msps ?",
    "for such a companion not to have been aleady discovered by pulsar timing analysis would require an orbital period @xmath153 yr .",
    "survival of such a wide binary is quite problematic in the core of a dense cluster like ngc  6752indeed no binary pulsar with @xmath154 day has been detected in collapsed clusters to date .",
    "seeing two such systems in ngc  6752 appears extremely unlikely .",
    "one may wonder if a _",
    "object , significantly more massive than a typical star in the cluster , could simultaneously produce the accelerations detected both in psr - b and psr - e .",
    "recently , colpi , possenti & gualandris ( 2002 ) suggested the presence of a binary black - hole ( bh ) of moderate mass ( @xmath155@xmath156 ) in the center of ngc  6752 in order to explain the unprecedented position of psr - a , a binary millisecond pulsar which is far away from the cluster center ( damico et al 2002 ) . as shown in figure [ map ] , the projected separation of psr - b and psr - e is only @xmath157 pc .",
    "a binary bh of total mass @xmath158 , approximately located in front of them within a distance of the same order of @xmath159 , could be accelerating both the pulsars without leaving any observable signature on the photometric profile of the cluster .",
    "as the bh binarity ensures a large cross section to interaction with other stars , the recoil velocity @xmath160 due a recent dynamical encounter could explain the offset position ( with respect to @xmath22 ) of the bh .",
    "however this scenario suffers of a probability at least as low as that of the previous two : placing the black hole at random within the core gives roughly a 1% chance that it would land in a location where it would produce the observed pulsar accelerations and the required @xmath161@xmath162 is also at the upper end of the expected distribution of @xmath160 for an intermediate mass black - hole in ngc  6752 ( colpi , mapelli & possenti 2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "1.0truecm in summary , on the basis of the available data , the accelerations shown by psr - b and psr - e can be easilier accounted by the usually adopted hypothesis _",
    "( i ) _ ( which could explain also the large positive @xmath82 of psr - d if it were not instrinsic ) , although the nature of the required extra amount ( @xmath163@xmath108 ) of low luminosity mass still remains puzzling .",
    "the existence of local perturber(s ) of the pulsar dynamics ( case _ ( ii ) _ ) is a distinct possibility .",
    "while it seems extremely unlikely purely on the basis of the high value of @xmath94 measured in psr - b and psr - e , there are other indications of a binary low - mass bh .",
    "in particular , it would explain : _ ( a ) _  the absence of any cusp in the radial density profile , _",
    "( b ) _  the flat velocity dispersion profile ( xie et al .",
    "2002 ) , _ ( c ) _   and _ ( d ) _  the ejection of psr - a and psr - c in the cluster outskirts ( colpi , possenti & gualandris 2002 ) .",
    "however it is admittedly _ ad hoc _ hypothesis , requiring a fine tuned scenario .",
    "clearly additional information must be collected . a longer baseline for",
    "timing measurements will allow to better constrain the presence of companions in very large orbits around psr - b and psr - e .",
    "in particular it will permit to derive ( at least ) upper limits on the second derivative of the pulsars spin period , which is more influenced by by - passing stars rather than by the cluster potential well ( phinney 1992 ) .",
    "similarly , the ( single massive or binary intermediate mass ) black - hole hypotheses could be better investigated with spectroscopic determination of the dispersion velocity of the stars located in the pulsars neighborhood , likewise with star density counts reaching higher magnitudes ( hence exploiting a larger sample of objects ) and better spatial resolution ( thus probing the innermost @xmath164 of the cluster and the pulsars surroundings ) .",
