    "solubilization of simple salts in aqueous solutions increases , in general , its surface tension  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical foundation of this phenomenon goes back almost a century ago to wagner  @xcite , who suggested an explanation based on image charges ( due to the water / air dielectric discontinuity ) .",
    "onsager and samaras ( os ) , in their _ tour de force _ paper , combined this idea with the debye - hckel ( dh )  @xcite theory , and calculated the dependence of surface tension on salt concentration  @xcite . while being overall successful at low salinity conditions , the os prediction implies the same increment of the surface tension for all monovalent salts  a finding that is at odds with many well - explored physical situations  @xcite .",
    "moreover , some simple monovalent acids and bases not only show quantitative discrepancy with the os result , but even act contrary to its qualitative features . these acids and bases may reduce the surface tension even in the low salinity limit where the os result is supposed to be universally valid .",
    "a vast number of attempts that go beyond the os theory have been proposed and incorporate ion - specific effects  @xcite .",
    "they are related to a much broader behavior of solutes in salt solutions observed already in the late 19th century by hofmeister and coworkers  @xcite , known nowadays as the _",
    "hofmeister series_. this series emerges in numerous chemical and biological systems  @xcite , including , but not limited to , forces between mica or silica surfaces  @xcite , as well as surface tension of electrolyte solutions  @xcite .    over the years",
    ", different theoretical approaches were devised to incorporate these experimental findings into a generalized theoretical framework .",
    "specifically , in order to incorporate ion - specific interactions , the well - known poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory was often taken as a point of departure .",
    "such an approach , pioneered by ninham and coworkers  @xcite , was later extended by levin and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "the boltzmann weight factor was modified by adding in an _ ad hoc _ manner different types of ion - specific interactions ( assumed to be additive ) , such as dispersion interactions  @xcite , image - charge interaction , stern exclusion layer , ionic cavitation energy and ionic polarizability  @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned modification of the boltzmann weight factor was used to calculate numerically the surface tension of electrolytes at the water / air interface , and with the addition of dispersion forces also at the oil / water interface  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the surface tension of acids  @xcite was computed by taking into account the preferential adsorption of hydrogen ( in the form of hydronium ions ) to the interface .",
    "we note that while these additional interaction terms may represent real physical mechanisms underlying the specific ion - surface interactions , these terms are , in general , non - additive  @xcite .    in our previous works",
    "@xcite , we introduced a self - consistent phenomenological approach that describes specific ion - surface interactions in the form of surface coupling terms in the free energy .",
    "furthermore , on a formal level , we argue that the original os result is , in fact , fluctuational in nature , and it is necessary to extend the pb formalism to account for fluctuations .",
    "this conceptual and formal development allowed us to derive an analytical theory that reunites the os result with the ionic specificity of the hofmeister series .",
    "our results demonstrate that simple specific ion - surface interactions can explain the appearance of the hofmeister series .    using the one - loop expansion beyond the linearized poisson - boltzmann theory ( the dh theory ) ,",
    "we have obtained  @xcite the surface tension dependence on salinity in agreement with experiment , and with the reverse hofmeister series .",
    "since this theory is valid only for _ weak _ ion - surface interactions , it is not fully compatible with strongly adhering ions such as acids .",
    "it is exactly this issue that is addressed in the present work , where we use a more general approach applicable for both weak and _ strong _ ion - surface interactions .",
    "we calculate analytically the dependence of the surface tension on the ionic strength by resorting to the one - loop expansion , while taking into account the full non - linear pb theory .",
    "the extension to strong surface potentials allows us to derive the surface tension of acids and other strongly adhering charged particles .",
    "our findings compare favorably with experimental results .",
    "the acids we considered are assumed to be strong .",
    "this means that for a simple monovalent acid dissociated in water , @xmath0 the pk of the acid dissociation reaction is smaller than roughly @xmath1 . in this case , the @xmath2 acid is always fully dissociated , irrespective of all the other parameters , and the h@xmath3 concentration is the same as the bulk acid concentration , @xmath4=n_b$ ] . on the contrary , for weak acids ,",
    "the amount of h@xmath3 is smaller than @xmath5 and depends on @xmath5 as well as on the acid pk .",
    "treating weak acids is rather a simple extension of the strong acid case , addressed in this paper , if one takes the pk value to be constant throughout the solution  @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present our model ( section  ii ) , calculate the mean - field electrostatic potential and the thermodynamic grand - canonical potential ( section  ii.a ) , followed by the one - loop correction to the grand potential ( section  ii.b ) .",
    "section  iii includes the surface tension results up to one - loop order , and in section  iv we compare these analytical expressions with experiments .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section  v. appendix  a extends our model to include both adhesivity and fixed surface charges , while in appendix  b , we compute the surface tension for strong surface potential and negative anion adhesivity .",

    "the adhesivity values are obtained by first fitting the ki data .",
    "then , this value of @xmath199 is used in order to fit the surface tension of the two homologous salts , kbr and kcl .",
    "notice that the adhesivity values for @xmath200 and @xmath201 are rather small and , thus , are similar to the results of the linearized dh theory of ref .",
    "however , @xmath202 is not that small , and the corresponding fit for ki is greatly improved when compared to ref .",
    "@xcite .    together with the previous results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain an extended reverse hofmeister series with decreasing adhesivity strength at the air / water interface : @xmath203 , while for cations the series is : @xmath204 . at the oil / water interface as in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the same reversed hofmeister series emerges with more attractive ion - surface interactions .",
    "this effect is substantially stronger for the anions , and might be connected with the stronger dispersion forces at the oil / water interface  @xcite , or change in the strength of hydrogen bonds close to the surface ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "our present work complements previous results obtained for surface tension of weakly adhering electrolytes  @xcite , and extend them to strong acids , bases , and other ions that strongly adsorb to the interface .",
    "this study is accomplished by considering the full non - linear pb theory for mean - field and one - loop fluctuation correction , which is valid for any strength of the ion - surface interaction ( the surface adhesivity , @xmath193 , in our model ) . in particular",
    ", we were able to obtain _ analytically _ the surface tension up to the one - loop order . as was explained before",
    ", the fluctuation correction is paramount to this endeavour as it generalizes the os argument , which is itself fluctuational in nature  @xcite .",
    "the analytical expressions derived for the surface tension is applicable for any adhesivity values , and reduces to results we derived previously for small adhering asymmetry ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that for the extreme case of strong adhesivities and high salt concentration , other effects such as ion - ion steric interactions , will play a role .",
    "our results for the surface tension are in accord with the reverse hofmeister series at the oil / water interface and extend the series to acids .",
    "it is possible to generalize our model to include the surface tension of weak acids .",
    "conceptually , the main change will be that the molarity of h@xmath3 is a function of the bulk concentration , @xmath5 and pk , @xmath4=f(n_b,{\\rm pk})$ ] . as written in the introduction ,",
    "this task is rather simple if one takes the pk value to be constant throughout the solution  @xcite .",
    "however , the corresponding equations that take fully into account the _ local _ acid dissociation reaction are more complex , though imminently solvable ( see ref .",
    "such a relation will be needed in order to compute the surface tension as a function of the experimental controlled molarity of the acid solution , @xmath5 .",
    "finally , we note that ion - surface interactions are the core of the ionic - specific hofmeister series .",
    "this statement is based on the generality of our model , its natural inclusion of the os result , and the very good fit to experimental data . with the same simple idea , and by merely taking into account the ion - surface specific interactions",
    ", we were able to recover the reverse hofmeister series and calculate the surface tension for weakly adsorbed ions at a surface  @xcite or within a proximal layer  @xcite , strongly adsorbed ions or acids ( the present work ) , and ionic profiles in the vicinity of the interface  @xcite .",
    "in the future , we hope that better understanding of the behavior of ions at interfaces will rely on more refined models that will explore the microscopic origin of the adhesivity parameter , @xmath193 .",
