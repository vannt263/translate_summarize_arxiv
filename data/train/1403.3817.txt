    "<S> we theoretically investigated two kinds of density oscillations , the friedel oscillation and collective excitation in the silicene and germanene within the random phase approximation , and found that the tunable spin - valley coupled band structure could lead to some exotic properties in these two phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> based on an exact analytical and numerical analysis , we demonstrated that the beating of the screened potential as well as the undamped plasmon mode can be taken as fingerprints of a topological phase transition in doped silicene and doped germanene . </S>",
    "<S> thus our proposal here establishes the connection between the topological phase transition and the density oscillations that can be accessed by a variety of experimental techniques .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) @xcite has been studied extensively in both theoretical and experimental aspects . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that topologically protected helical edge states are a distinct feature which characterizes the qshe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transport measurement of edge states requires that the bulk state must be insulating . in practice , the system is usually metallic resulting from defects , self - doping and charge transfer from metallic substrates , and thus the detection of the topological phase transition ( tpt ) when the bulk is metallic becomes urgent and important in two - dimensional systems . in this rapid communication </S>",
    "<S> , we connect the tpt with two kinds of density oscillations : friedel oscillation @xcite and collective excitation in silicene and germanene .    </S>",
    "<S> silicene @xcite , a single layer of silicon atoms forming a two - dimensional ( 2d ) buckled honeycomb lattice , can be regarded as the silicon - based counterpart of graphene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the buckled honeycomb structure gives rise to a tunable spin - valley coupled band structure , which accounts for many exotic transport and superconducting phenomena @xcite and makes silicene a promising candidate for the qshe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far silicene or its superstructure has only been synthesized on metallic surfaces @xcite , hence the transport measurement of the helical edge states is prevented due to the metallic bulk state . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , it has been claimed that a dirac - like spectrum does exist in silicene from experimental observations @xcite . although there is some debate about the origin of the linear dispersion @xcite , it is still highly worthwhile to examine whether or not silicene hosts the qsh state .    in this rapid communication , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a detection method of tpt by employing both the friedel oscillation and collective excitation in silicene , and show how to extract the information about the tpt from these two effects . </S>",
    "<S> first , the screened potential of charged impurities has a beating structure of friedel oscillations ( the interference pattern of two branches of density waves of electrons ) . </S>",
    "<S> as one band gap decreases ( for example , the spin - up gap in fig . [ fig1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , the beating of the screened potential gradually becomes faint and eventually vanishes at the tpt point . </S>",
    "<S> second , the undamped plasmon mode ( upm ) that emerges in the single - particle excitation ( spe ) gap disappears when approaching the tpt point and reappears after it . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , these two kinds of density oscillations can be used to detect the tpt in metallic silicene and germanene .    </S>",
    "<S> we start from a simple low - energy effective hamiltonian in silicene under an external electric field@xcite , @xmath0 where the subscripts @xmath1 denote the two inequivalent valleys or dirac points @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the first term describes the behavior of 2d dirac electrons with the fermi velocity @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the second term is the intrinsic spin orbit coupling ( soc ) term with a magnitude of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the last term is due to the @xmath6 sublattice symmetry breaking and is defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the effective external electric field perpendicular to the sample including all of the screening effect , and @xmath9 is the perpendicular distance between the two sublattice planes . </S>",
    "<S> pauli matrices @xmath10 and @xmath11 act on the pseudospin space related to the @xmath12 and @xmath13 sublattices and the real spin degree of freedom , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> since the strength of the intrinsic rashba soc is much smaller than that of the intrinsic soc @xcite , we can neglect it here . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the effective hamiltonian can be classified by the eigenvalues of @xmath14 and the corresponding hamiltonian of the @xmath2 valley can be expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 refer to the spin - up and spin - down bands , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> two remarks are in order . </S>",
    "<S> first , the corresponding hamiltonian of the @xmath3 valley can be obtained from eq.@xmath17 via the time reversal operation . </S>",
    "<S> second , we assume that there are no short - range impurities and defects that cause intervalley scattering . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , we are able to restrict our discussion to the case of a single valley , and then multiply the valley - degeneracy factor @xmath18 to the final results . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues of the effective hamiltonian in eq.@xmath17 can be evaluated straightforwardly as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 are for the conduction and valence bands , and @xmath21 are the spin dependent energy gaps with @xmath22 .    before presenting the detailed calculations , we first discuss the topological phases of our model hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the model would describe the gapless graphene for @xmath23 and gapped graphene for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , [ see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]@xmath26 . when @xmath24 and @xmath27 , the model will account for silicene . </S>",
    "<S> the region for @xmath28 pertains to the qsh state with a pair of helical edge states , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]@xmath29 , and for @xmath30 the system is the usual band insulator without any topological edge states [ see fig . [ fig1]@xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , when @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 , at the @xmath2 valley the spin - up band becomes gapless and the gap of the spin - down band is @xmath5 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]@xmath34 , while at the @xmath3 valley the spin reverses , which has been termed a valley - spin - polarized semimetal @xcite and is a unique characteristic of silicene .     </S>",
    "<S> +   +    in the following we want to investigate the friedel oscillation and the plasmon spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the analytic dielectric function within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the fourier transform of the 2d coulomb interaction , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the effective background dielectric constant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the full formal expression of the polarization function in silicene is given by @xcite @xmath39-n_{f}\\left[e_{\\sigma\\lambda^{\\prime}}\\left({\\bf { \\bf k}^{\\prime}}\\right)\\right]}{\\hbar\\omega+e_{\\sigma\\lambda}\\left({\\bf k}\\right)-e_{\\sigma\\lambda^{\\prime}}\\left({\\bf { \\bf k}^{\\prime}}\\right)+i\\eta},\\label{chi0qomega}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the eigenstate corresponding to @xmath41 , @xmath42 is a positive infinitesimal quantity , @xmath43 , and @xmath44^{-1}$ ] , with @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> noted that since the spin - up component and spin - down component decouple with each other , the total polarization function turns out to be the summation of those for both spin species . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization function for a certain spin species in silicene is mathematically identical to the case of a gapped graphene .    to proceed with the theoretical details , we assume zero temperature @xmath46 , and then the noninteracting fermi function @xmath47 turns into a simple step function @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict our discussion to positive frequencies @xmath49 because of the general relation @xmath50^{\\ast}$ ] . due to the electron - hole symmetry </S>",
    "<S> , the plasmon in both @xmath51- and @xmath52-doped samples would show the same dynamical behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can concentrate on the @xmath51- doped case , namely , the finite chemical potential @xmath53 lies in the conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> since when @xmath54 there is no beating in the screened potential , in our discussion of friedel oscillation , we require that the fermi contour consists of two fermi circles with different fermi wave vectors , @xmath55 as long as the external electric field changes .    </S>",
    "<S> the static screened potential of a charged impurity is given by the integration of the dielectric function , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the static dielectric function , @xmath58 the charge of the impurity and @xmath59 the zeroth order bessel function of the first kind , which comes from the integration over the angular variable . </S>",
    "<S> after some cumbersome manipulations , one can obtain the static wave vector dependent polarization function from eq.([chi0qomega ] ) , @xmath60.\\label{staticchi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     +   +    therefore , the screened potential can be obtained from eq.([phi ] ) by numerical integration over @xmath61 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) . at a large distance from the charged impurity ( @xmath62 ) , </S>",
    "<S> there are two main contributions to the screened potential . </S>",
    "<S> the first part is the thomas - fermi contribution , @xmath63 with @xmath64 the effective fine structure constant , which is determined by the long - wavelength ( @xmath65 ) behavior of the polarization function , @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the scale @xmath67 of the screened potential at the long - wavelength limit can also be found in the traditional 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) @xcite , gapless and gapped graphene @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the second part is oscillatory , the friedel oscillation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lighthill theorem @xcite states that singularities in the derivatives of the polarization function lead to an algebraic , and oscillating decay of the screened potential . for the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the first derivative of the polarization function is discontinuous at @xmath70 . for the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) , the first derivative of the polarization function is discontinuous at @xmath73 but continuous at @xmath74 , and the second derivative of the polarization function is singular at @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the asymptotic screened potential is a superposition of two kinds of oscillations , which gives rise to a @xmath75 in the oscillatory part of the screened potential as ( see the supplemental material @xcite ) , @xmath76,\\label{oscpoten1}\\\\ & & \\phi_{\\gamma=1}(r)\\approx \\frac{z e}{\\kappa}\\big[f_{-}(r)+g_{+}(r)\\big],\\label{oscpoten2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are given by @xmath80 it should be noted that the discrepancy between the oscillatory decay @xmath81 in gapped graphene @xcite and @xmath82 in gapless graphene @xcite is because of the unique @xmath83 berry phase of each dirac point in gapless graphene that suppresses the backscattering of particles on the fermi surface during intravalley scattering @xcite .     +   +    when @xmath84 , both the spin - up and spin - down bands are gapped , and therefore the static polarizability has two cusps and its first derivative is singular at @xmath70 [ see figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]@xmath29 and [ fig2]@xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding oscillatory potential is displayed in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]@xmath85 , [ fig3]@xmath34 , and [ fig3]@xmath86 . for a gapped graphene with @xmath25 , </S>",
    "<S> the two fermi wave vectors @xmath87 become degenerate so that only one cusp of static polarizability remains , and the singularity of its first derivative locates at @xmath88 ( with @xmath89 ) [ see fig . [ fig2]@xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore there is only a one - component friedel oscillation which does not support beating . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , at the tpt point @xmath90 , the polarization function has a cusp at @xmath91 , and its first derivative is continuous at @xmath92 but discontinuous at @xmath91 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]@xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the screened potential turns out to be a superposition of @xmath93 for gapless graphene with @xmath94 and @xmath95 for gapped graphene with @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> since the latter overwhelmingly dominates in magnitude at a large distance , the superposition of these two oscillating parts does not have an indistinguishable beating as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]@xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the screened potentials can be captured by our approximative expressions in eqs.([oscpoten1 ] ) and ( [ oscpoten2 ] ) ( more details can be found in the supplemental material @xcite ) .    from figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]@xmath97-[fig3]@xmath86 , one can clearly see that as the ratio @xmath98 approaches @xmath99 , the beating gets gradually faint and disappears at the tpt point . </S>",
    "<S> once crossing the tpt point , the beating of the oscillatory potential becomes noticeable . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the evolution of the beating can be seen as a fingerprint of tpt in metallic silicene . </S>",
    "<S> note that the beating in the topological phase is usually much longer than the counterpart in the normal phase , which provides us with quantitative evidence of the topological nature of the phase . </S>",
    "<S> the friedel oscillation can be extracted from the differential tunneling conductance using scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) , which has been used to investigate the friedel oscillation in a @xmath100 superstructure of silicene on ag(111 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we expect that further sts measurements on the friedel oscillation of silicene could be used to identify the tpt tuned by the external electrical fields .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to calculate the plasmon dispersion @xmath101 by solving the following equation , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the decay rate of the plasmons . at small energies and momenta @xmath104 with @xmath105 , one can obtain the polarization function in the long - wavelength limit , @xmath106 /(2\\pi\\hbar^2\\omega^{2}).\\label{approxexpress}\\ ] ] hence , one immediately obtains the corresponding plasmon frequencies , @xmath107q/\\hbar}. \\label{plasmonlongwave}\\ ] ] we note that @xmath108 is a peculiarity of 2d plasmon dispersions including both the 2deg and dirac fermions . in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]@xmath97-[fig4]@xmath34 , we show the exact numerical plasmon dispersion within rpa ( solid red line ) and the long - wavelength plasmon ( lwp ) ( dashed blue line ) . the spe region is given by @xmath109\\neq0 $ ] and displayed as shaded areas in the @xmath110 space , where the plasmon is damped into electron - hole pairs ( landau damping ) . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]@xmath97-[fig4]@xmath34 , the lwp frequency @xmath111 is well consistent with the exact numerical solution @xmath112 in the small wave vector regime .     </S>",
    "<S> +   +    at the tpt point @xmath113 , there exists only one plasmon mode which is undamped until it enters the interband spe region . </S>",
    "<S> note that this branch of the plasmon had been studied extensively in the context of graphene and a number of exciting applications were proposed for plasmonics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the tpt point , the exact numerical solution displays two plasmon modes : one branch of the plasmon is mentioned above , and the other is a upm that emerges in the spe gap [ see the insets of figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]@xmath97-[fig4]@xmath34 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this upm can be observed by infrared optical spectroscopy @xcite , angular - resolved photoemission spectroscopy @xcite , and other methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that although our upm has been found in gapped graphene , the observation in practice is still hard to achieve because of the weak interaction with the substrate or the small intrinsic soc . to protect the upm against the thermal effects and impurity scattering </S>",
    "<S> requires a large spe gap , which is mainly determined by the soc gap . </S>",
    "<S> the soc gaps are about @xmath115 and @xmath116 @xmath117 for silicene and germanene , respectively @xcite . for silicene , its corresponding energy ranges from @xmath99 to @xmath118 @xmath117 by tuning the chemical potential </S>",
    "<S> and it can be detected experimentally on insulating substrates . </S>",
    "<S> for germanene , the energy of upm is an order of magnitude larger than that of silicene and is accessed by some experimental methods on both insulating and metallic substrates @xcite .    compared with gapped graphene @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the tunable spin - valley coupled band structure in silicene gives rise to two additional features in the plasmon spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> first , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]@xmath86 , the plasmon frequencies have redshifted as the ratio @xmath98 increases by adjusting the electric field , which can be read out from the long - wavelength solution in eq.@xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> second , the upm in the spe gap decays into a spe continuum at the tpt point and then reappears after the system separates from the tpt point . </S>",
    "<S> when closing to the tpt point @xmath120 , the system has a very tiny band gap , and the thermal fluctuation or disorder scattering could smear the small gap and eventually destroy the upm . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the disappearance of the upm can take place in a small region around @xmath32 in the spectral function and help us to identify the tpt point . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the fate of the upm indeed reflects the change of the topology of energy bands . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , combining with lwp , the behavior of the plasmons can clearly characterize the topological nature of the phase . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , when the system is in the normal phase with @xmath121 , decreasing the electric field @xmath8 makes the lwp have a violetshift and the upm disappears near the tpt point and then reappears in the topological phase . </S>",
    "<S> discussions of other situations are similar .    in summary , we explored friedel oscillations and collective excitation in silicene and germanene within rpa . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the tunable spin - valley coupled band structure could cause some exotic properties in these two phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the beating of the screened impurity potential and the behavior of upm can both be used as probes for tpt in silicene and germanene . </S>",
    "<S> our work sheds light on the identification of tpt via some physical effects . </S>",
    "<S> the distinct features of the density oscillations can also provide us with some hints on how to resolve controversy concerning the origin of the linear dispersion .    _ note added . _ </S>",
