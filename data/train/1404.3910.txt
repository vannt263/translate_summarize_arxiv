    "a _ holomorphic motion _ in dimension one is a family of injections @xmath1 of some set @xmath2 holomorphically depending on a parameter @xmath0 ( ranging over some complex manifold @xmath3 ) .",

    "we show that under suitable conditions , the holomorphic motion of the boundary can be extended to a holomorphic motion of the surfaces . the proof is based upon teichmller theory .",
    "this work is motivated by study of the geometry of the critical locus @xmath18 for the hnon automorphisms @xmath19 of @xmath20 .",
    "this locus was introduced by hubbard ( see @xcite ) as the set of tangencies between two dynamically defined foliations outside the `` big '' julia set .",
