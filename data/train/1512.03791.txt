    "many real - world phenomena are described by non - integer order systems .",
    "in fact , they model several problems since they take into consideration e.g. the memory of the process , friction , flow in heterogenous porous media , viscoelasticity , etc @xcite .",
    "fractional derivative and fractional integral are generalizations of ordinary calculus , by considering derivatives of arbitrary real or complex order , and a general form for multiple integrals .",
    "although mathematicians have wondered since the very beginning of calculus about these questions , only recently they have proven their usefulness and since then important results have appeared not only in mathematics , but also in physics , applied engineering , biology , etc .",
    "one question that is important is what type of fractional operator should be considered , since we have in hand several distinct definitions and the choice dependes on the considered problem .",
    "because of this , we find in the literature several papers dealing with similar subjects , but for different type of fractional operators .",
    "so , to overcome this , one solution is to consider general definitions of fractional derivatives and integrals , for which the known ones are simply particular cases .",
    "we mention for example the approach using kernels ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section [ sec : fc ] we present the definitions of left and right katugampola fractional integrals of order @xmath0 .",
    "next , in section [ sec : af ] , we prove the two new results of the paper , theorems [ teo1 ] and [ teo2 ] .",
    "the formula is simple to use , and uses only the function itself and an auxiliary family of functions , where each of them is given by a solution of a cauchy problem .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : ex ] , we present some examples where we compare the exact fractional integral of a test function with some numerical approximations as given in the previous section . to end , we exemplify how we can apply the approximation to solve a fractional integral equation with an initial condition .",
    "to start , we review the main concept as presented in @xcite .",
    "it generalizes the riemann  liouville and hadamard fractional integrals by introducing in the definition a new parameter @xmath1 , that allows us to obtain them for special values of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 be two nonnegative real numbers with @xmath4 , @xmath5 two positive real numbers , and @xmath6\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}$ ] be an integrable function .",
    "the left katugampola fractional integral is defined as @xmath7 and the right katugampola fractional integral is defined as @xmath8    these notions were motivated from the following relation . when @xmath9 is an integer ,",
    "the left katugampola fractional integral is a generalization of the @xmath10-fold integrals @xmath11 @xmath12 we also notice that , taking @xmath13 , we obtain the left and right riemann ",
    "liouville fractional integrals , and as @xmath14 , we get the left and right hadamard fractional integrals ( cf .",
    "we refer to @xcite , where a notion of katugampola fractional derivative is presented , generalizing the riemann  liouville and hadamard fractional derivatives of order @xmath15 , and to @xcite where an existence and uniqueness result is proven for a fractional differential equation involving this new operator .    for example , consider the function @xmath16 then , @xmath17^{\\a-1}(\\t^\\r - a^\\r)^v d\\tau .",

    "we prove an approximation formula for the katugampola fractional integrals , which will allow us later to solve a fractional integral equation , by approximating it by an ordinary differential equation .",
