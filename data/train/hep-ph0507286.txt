    "they are based on the general principles of unitarity of the scattering matrix ( conservation of probability ) and analyticity of scattering amplitudes ( causality ) .",

    "further progress came with the study of `` hard '' scattering processes , characterized by a momentum transfer significantly larger than the typical mass scale associated with hadron structure , @xmath1 ( a reasonable numerical value for this scale is the @xmath2 meson mass ) .",
    "such processes can be described in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the field theory of interacting quarks and gluons , the fundamental property of which is the smallness of the effective coupling constant in small space ",
    "time intervals ( asymptotic freedom ) @xcite .",
    "hard processes happen so `` rapidly '' that they do not significantly change the environment of the interacting quarks and gluons inside the hadrons .",

    "thus , while qcd factorization can still be applied to certain hard processes in @xmath15 collisions , the modeling of the hadronic environment of the quarks and gluons participating in the hard process ( or processes ) is generally much more challenging than in @xmath10 scattering .",
    "this review is an attempt to summarize what has been learned about small@xmath0 physics from experiments at hera and the tevatron and related theoretical studies , and use this information to make predictions for new qcd phenomena observable at lhc .",
    "with lhc about to be commissioned , and the hera program nearing completion , this is a timely exercise .",
    "it is not our aim to give a comprehensive overview of the existing collider experiments and their numerous implications for our understanding of qcd .",
    "rather , we identify certain specific `` lessons '' which are of particular importance in making the transition from hera to lhc :    * _ black  disk limit in dipole ",
    "hadron interactions .",
    "_ because of the fast rise of the gluon density at small @xmath0 , the strength of interaction of small color  singlet configurations ( dipoles ) with hadronic matter can approach the maximum value allowed by @xmath18channel unitarity .",
    "we quantify this effect by formulating an optical model of dipole ",
    "hadron scattering , in which the unitarity limit corresponds to the scattering from a `` black disk '' , whose radius increases with energy ( black disk limit , or bdl ) .",
    "we argue that the onset of the bdl regime can be seen in the diffractive dis data at the upper end of the hera energy range , as well as in elastic @xmath15 scattering at tevatron energies .",
    "in dis at higher energies , the bdl leads to a breakdown of bjorken scaling . in hadron ",
    "hadron collisions at lhc energies and beyond ( cosmic ray physics ) , the dynamics will be deep inside the bdl regime , with numerous consequences for the hadronic final states . * _ small transverse area of leading partons .",
    "_ studies of hard exclusive processes at hera show that partons in the nucleon with @xmath19 and significant transverse momenta are concentrated in a small transverse area , @xmath20 , substantially smaller than the area associated with the nucleon in soft ( hadronic ) interactions at high energies .",
    "the resulting `` two  scale picture '' of the transverse structure of the nucleon is essential for modeling the hadronic environment of the colliding partons in high ",
    "energy @xmath13 collisions with hard processes .    based on these observations ,",
    "we make several predictions for new strong interaction phenomena observable in @xmath13 , @xmath21 ( proton  nucleus ) , and @xmath22 ( nucleus  nucleus ) collisions at lhc :    * _ hard processes as a trigger for central @xmath13 collisions . _ in @xmath13 scattering at lhc , hard qcd processes involving binary collisions of partons with momentum fractions @xmath23 occur practically only in @xmath13 events with small impact parameters ( central collisions ) .",
    "this makes it possible to trigger on central @xmath13 events by requiring the presence of a hard dijet ( or double dijet ) at small rapidities . *",
    "_ black  disk limit in central @xmath24 collisions at lhc .",
    "_ the approach to the bdl at high energies will strongly affect the dynamics of central @xmath24 collisions at lhc energies and above .",
    "a crucial point is that in hadron ",
    "hadron collisions at such energies one is dealing mostly with gluon ",
    "gluon dipoles , whose cross section for scattering from hadronic matter is @xmath25 times larger than that of the quark ",
    "antiquark dipoles dominating @xmath10 scattering .",
    "we argue that as a consequence of the approach to the bdl the leading partons in central @xmath13 collisions will acquire large transverse momenta ( @xmath26 ) and fragment independently , resulting in the disappearance of leading hadrons with small transverse momenta at forward / backward rapidities , increased energy loss , and increased soft particle production at central rapidities .",
    "these observable effects allow for experimental studies of this fascinating new regime of `` strong gluon fields '' at lhc .",
    "we also outline the role of the bdl in heavy ",
    "ion collisions and cosmic ray physics . *",
    "_ diffraction in high  energy @xmath13 collisions .",
    "_ lhc offers the possibility to study a wide variety of diffractive processes in high  energy @xmath13 scattering , which probe the interaction of small  size color singlets with hadronic matter and can be used to map the gluon distribution in the proton .",
    "such processes involve a delicate interplay between hard ( partonic ) and soft ( hadronic ) interactions .",
    "a crucial ingredient in understanding the dynamics is the information about the transverse spatial distribution of gluons obtained from exclusive vector meson production in dis at hera .",
    "we also comment on the potential of lhc for parton distribution measurements at small @xmath0 , and for studies of small@xmath0 dynamics via photon  induced reactions in ultraperipheral @xmath24 collisions .",
    "finally , we discuss the opportunities for studies of small@xmath0 dynamics provided by the planned electron  ion collider .",

    " energy @xmath13 collisions .",
    "the small@xmath0 phenomena we describe here directly impact on this program .",
    "heavy particles are produced in hard partonic collisions .",
    "for the reason described above , the production of heavy particles in inelastic @xmath13 collisions happens predominantly in central collisions , which are strongly affected by the approach to the bdl , and the strong interaction background may be completely different from what one would expect based on the naive extrapolation of existing data ( tevatron ) .",
    "likewise , the search for higgs bosons in diffractive @xmath13 events depends crucially on the understanding of the strong interaction dynamics in these processes .",
    "we begin by introducing the basic concept of qcd factorization of hard processes , and outlining the space  time evolution of small@xmath0 scattering processes at high energies .",
    "our main point is the correspondence between the `` parton '' picture of hard processes in a frame in which the nucleon is moving fast , and the `` dipole '' picture of high  energy processes in the target rest frame . in this section",

    "sec : hadron ] ) . the gap could be filled , to some extent , by experiments at rhic and the proposed electron ",
    "ion collider @xcite .",
    "extension of the forward acceptance of the current rhic detectors would make it possible to measure drell ",
    "yan pair production at @xmath348 in @xmath13 and @xmath349 scattering .",
    "this would allow one to test the predictions for leading ",
    "twist nuclear shadowing and look for deviations from the leading  twist prediction in the @xmath326 distributions of the dileptons .",
    "qualitatively , one expects a suppression of the low transverse momentum part of the distribution up to @xmath350 . as mentioned above",
    ", such measurements would also allow one to probe the role of final state interactions by varying the @xmath0values of the leading partons in the proton .",
    "if absorption effects were significant , one would have to introduce a cut on @xmath351 to suppress these effects , which would reduce somewhat the @xmath352range where the parton densities can be probed .    the erhic design for a future electron  ion collider envisages an @xmath353 collider with @xmath354 , with significantly higher luminosity than hera , and the ability to continuously vary the beam energies over a wide range @xcite . with such a facility",
    "one could systematically study a variety of color transparency phenomena and use them to disentangle the quark ",
    "gluon structure of hadrons and nuclei ; one could also measure longitudinal cross sections , which provide stringent tests of the range of the validity of the leading  twist approximation at small @xmath0 ( see sections  [ sec : inclusive ] , [ sec : exclusive ] and [ sec : diffraction ] ) . in @xmath322 collisions",
    ", one could study the transition of the nonperturbative shadowing at low @xmath38 to the regime of leading  twist shadowing at high @xmath38 , and explore whether there exists an `` intermediate '' regime characterized by weak coupling but large parton densities .",
    "the ability to perform such measurements with a range of nuclear beams would allow one to study these effects as a function of the nuclear thickness , reaching values 1.5 times larger than the average thickness of the heavy nuclei .",
    "no other planned facilities would be able to cover this important kinematic region .",
    "finally , erhic would make it possible to measure the @xmath82dependence of a variety of hard exclusive processes in a wide range of @xmath0 , @xmath355 .",
    "this would probe the transverse structure of the proton directly in the @xmath0range relevant for understanding nucleon fragmentation in central @xmath320 collisions at lhc . +",
