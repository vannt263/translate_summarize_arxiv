    "quantum microcavity is unique laboratory for studies of the strong light - matter coupling .",
    "being first observed two decades ago @xcite , the strong coupling regime is now routinely achieved in different kinds of microcavities @xcite . from the fundamental viewpoint ,",
    "it is interesting as a basis to investigate various collective phenomena in condensed matter systems such as bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite and superfluidity @xcite . from the viewpoint of applications",
    ", it opens a way to the realization of optoelectonic devices of the new generation @xcite : room - temperature polariton lasers @xcite , polarization- controlled optical gates @xcite , and others .",
    "several applications of the strong coupling regime were also proposed for the quantum information processing @xcite . in this case",
    "one should be able to tune the number of emitted photons in controllable way .",
    "this is hard to achieve in planar microcavities where the number of elementary excitations is macroscopically large , but is possible in microcavities containing single quantum dots ( qds ) where qd exciton can be coupled to a confined electromagnetic mode provided by a micropillar ( etched planar cavity ) @xcite , a defect of the photonic crystal @xcite or a whispering gallery mode @xcite .",
    "that is why the strong coupled systems based on qds have attracted particular attention recently .",
    "depending on the size of the qd , its elementary excitations can behave as fermions ( small qds whose size is comparable with exciton radius in the bulk material ) @xcite , bosons ( large qds whose size is much larger than exciton radius in the bulk material ) @xcite or particles with intermediate statistics ( medium size qds ) @xcite . in the current paper , we consider a small single qd in a microcavity that corresponds to the case of fermions . for symmetric qds",
    "such system can be described by the well - known jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xcite which predicts transformation of the rabi doublet to the mollow triplet in the emission spectrum as intensity of the external pump growth for both coherent @xcite and incoherent excitation schemes @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the incorporation of the asymmetry into the quantum system can radically change its emission pattern and lead to the opening of optical transitions which were forbidden in the symmetric case .",
    "particularly , the breaking of inversion symmetry opens optical transitions at the rabi frequency at qds placed in strong external laser field @xcite .",
    "the similar effect occurs for asymmetric quantum wells placed inside a planar microcavity @xcite . in current manuscript we consider modification of the emission spectrum of asymmetric qds inside a single - mode microcavity using fully quantum approach .    the work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the formalism and introduce the model hamiltonian . in section",
    "iii we obtain analytical solutions for the important particular cases . in section",
    "iv we discuss the incorporation of pump and decay terms into the hamiltonian and present the numerical calculations of the emission spectrum .",
    "section v contains discussions and conclusions .",
    "we model qd as a two - level quantum system with the ground state @xmath0 and excited state @xmath1 with energies @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "qd is placed inside a cavity and interacts resonantly with confined electromagnetic mode of the frequency @xmath4 . since electromagnetic field can transfer an electron in the qd from the valence band into the conduction band , the ground state @xmath0 corresponds to the absence of free carriers while the first excited state @xmath1 is the state with an electron in the conduction band and a hole in the valence band .",
    "therefore , the energy difference @xmath5 is approximately equal to the band gap of the qd minus excitonic correction accounting for the coulomb attraction between the electron and the hole .    the full hamiltonian of the system can be represented as a sum of three parts , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hamiltonian of the single qd , and @xmath8 are the pauli matrices acting in the space of @xmath1 and @xmath0 states .",
    "the hamiltonian of the free electromagnetic field reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the annihilation and creation operators for cavity photons , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath11 describes interaction of the qd with the electromagnetic field and can be constructed as following .",
    "the interaction of a classical dipole @xmath12 with a classical external electric field @xmath13 is given by the expression @xmath14 .",
    "within the quantum - field approach , we have to replace the classical quantities @xmath12 and @xmath13 with the corresponding operators @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the polarization vector of the cavity mode , @xmath17 is the vacuum dielectric permittivity , @xmath18 are dipole matrix elements of the qd , @xmath19 is the unity matrix , @xmath20 . in the case of symmetric qd , the matrix elements @xmath21 and @xmath22 are zero . due to the breaking of inversion symmetry in asymmetric qds , the dipole matrix elements appear to be nonequivalent , @xmath23 .",
    "this leads to new physical effects discussed hereafter .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian can be written as @xmath24 the coupling parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , describe the excitation - exchange interaction and the symmetry - dependent interaction , respectively .",
    "for definiteness , we assume them to be real .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 in the expressions above is the quantization volume and can be estimated as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the characteristic wavelength corresponding to the cavity mode .",
    "we also put @xmath30 , which can be justified for nonferroelectric qds .",
    "indeed , asymmetry of such qds is provided by peculiar shape and/or an external electric field . due to it ,",
    "the matrix element @xmath31 is proportional to the size of the elementary cell of the crystal lattice , while the matrix element @xmath32 is proportional to the size of the qd . as a result , in realistic qds one has @xmath33 . to pass from the second line to the third line in eq .",
    "( [ eqhamiltonian ] ) , the rotating - wave approximation @xcite was applied and we dropped the anti- resonant terms proportional to @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the full hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath36 in the case of a symmetric qd , the coupling parameter @xmath37 equals zero .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ eqfullhamiltonian ] ) reduces to the hamiltonian of the fully solvable jaynes - cummings model .",
    "its eigenstates correspond to electronic excitations dressed by the cavity photons and can be expressed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 ^ 2+g_r^2n } } , \\label{an}\\ ] ] @xmath40 ^ 2+g_r^2n } } , \\label{bn}\\ ] ] and the composite electron - photon states @xmath41 and @xmath42 describe both the qd state ( the ground state @xmath43 or the excited state @xmath44 ) and the field state with @xmath45 cavity photons .",
    "it should be noted that the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian commutes with the excitation number operator @xmath46 whose eigenstates correspond to the conserved number of total electron - photon excitations in the system counted as number of the excitations in qd ( one for the state @xmath0 , zero for the state @xmath1 ) plus number of the photons in the cavity mode .",
    "the eigenenergies corresponding to the states ( [ eqwavefunction0 ] ) are given by @xmath47 in order to obtain the emission spectrum of the system , we need to analyze optical transitions between the eigenstates ( [ eqwavefunction0 ] ) .",
    "an emitted photon goes outside the system , and a pumped photon appears in the system .",
    "thus , there is an exchange of photons between the coupled qd - microcavity system and some external reservoir .",
    "therefore , we can introduce the hamiltonian of the exchange of photons between cavity and outside world , @xmath48 where @xmath49 are creation and annihilation operators for the external photons , @xmath50 is the system - reservoir coupling constant .",
    "the probabilities ( intensities ) of transitions with emission of photon from the cavity are proportional to the corresponding matrix elements , @xmath51 where the symbols @xmath52 denote the final and initial eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ eqwavefunction0 ] ) , @xmath53 and @xmath54 describe zero- and one - photon states of the reservoir . substituting eq .",
    "( [ eqhex ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ iif ] ) , one gets @xmath55 where the states @xmath56 are defined by eq .",
    "( [ eqwavefunction0 ] ) , and integers @xmath57 are initial and final numbers of electron - photon excitations in the system , defined earlier ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqexnumop ] ) ) .    the kronecker delta in eq .",
    "( [ eqtrans ] ) means that only transitions changing number of excitations by one are allowed in a system described by the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eqeigenen ] ) that in the case of resonance ( @xmath58 ) the optical spectrum contains peaks at the energies @xmath59 , where @xmath60 .",
    "the accounting of the peaks broadening leads to the emission spectrum in the form of the rabi doublet ( for @xmath61 ) , and the mollow triplet ( for @xmath62 ) @xcite . in the intermediate regime",
    "more complicated multiplet structure can be observed @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that in symmetric qds ( @xmath63 ) transitions at the rabi frequency @xmath64 are forbidden .",
    "indeed , the transitions would occur between electron - photon states with the same number of excitations , @xmath65 , that is not allowed by eq .",
    "( [ iif1 ] ) .",
    "however , these transitions become possible for asymmetric qds , i.e. when the full hamiltonian ( [ eqfullhamiltonian ] ) contains the term @xmath66 @xcite . since for realistic microcavities",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath67 lies in the terahertz ( thz ) range , such transitions form the physical basis for using the considered system as a tunable source of thz radiation .",
    "we will consider these thz transitions in more details in the following sections .",
    "first of all , let us consider analytically the case of weak asymmetry",
    ". then the hamiltonian ( [ eqfullhamiltonian ] ) can be represented as a sum of two parts @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian , and @xmath70 is the term arising from the asymmetry of the qd . considering the term ( [ eqv ] ) as a small perturbation and using the standard first - order perturbation theory ,",
    "the corrected wavefunctions of the system can be written as @xmath71 are the unperturbed eigenfunctions ( [ eqwavefunction0 ] ) , @xmath72 are the corresponding eigenenergies ( [ eqeigenen ] ) , and @xmath73 are the matrix elements of the perturbation ( [ eqv ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that these matrix elements are different from zero only if @xmath74 , and thus states with @xmath75 and @xmath76 excitations become mixed by the asymmetry of qd .",
    "this mixture leads to the opening of the optical transitions @xmath77 at the frequencies @xmath78 .",
    "as well , transitions at double frequencies of the cavity @xmath79 become opened .",
    "the allowed transitions are shown schematically in fig .",
    "since rabi frequency @xmath67 lies typically in the thz range , asymmetric qd - cavity system can be used as a nonlinear thz emitter . using eqs .",
    "( [ eqtrans ] ) and ( [ eqwfperturb ] ) , we obtain the intensity of thz transitions as follows : @xmath80 where @xmath81 with coefficients @xmath82 and @xmath83 given by expressions ( [ an ] ) and ( [ bn ] ) , respectively .",
    "one can also consider analytically another physical situation : the asymmetry is no longer assumed to be a weak perturbation , but photon occupation numbers are supposed to be large , @xmath62 .",
    "this limiting case corresponds to the classical electromagnetic field in the cavity .",
    "let us represent the full hamiltonian ( [ eqfullhamiltonian ] ) as a sum of the `` diagonal '' part @xmath84 and the `` off - diagonal '' part @xmath85 the hamiltonian ( [ eqhd ] ) does not commute with the excitation number operator ( [ eqexnumop ] ) , but commutes with the pauli matrix @xmath86 .",
    "this means that eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ eqhd ] ) can be represented as @xmath87 ) , ( [ psi2 ] ) into the schrdinger equation @xmath88 with the hamiltonian ( [ eqhd ] ) , we obtain the system of algebraic equations for coefficients @xmath89 : @xmath90 c_{nk}^{g}=0\\ ] ] for @xmath91 , @xmath92 c_{nk}^{e } + 2g_s\\sqrt{k+1}c_{n , k+1}^{e}=0\\label{eqcn2}\\ ] ] for @xmath93 , @xmath94 c_{nk}^{e}\\nonumber\\\\ + 2g_s\\left(\\sqrt{k+1}c_{n , k+1}^{e}+\\sqrt{k}c_{n , k-1}^{e}\\right)=0\\label{eqcn3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath95 .    the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eqcn1 ] ) are evident : @xmath96 as for eqs .",
    "( [ eqcn3 ] ) , in the limiting case @xmath97 they are similar to the well - known recurrent expression for the bessel function of the first kind : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is an integer and @xmath100 is the argument of the bessel function of the first kind , @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , we can write the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eqcn3 ] ) for @xmath97 as @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "it should be noted that the solutions ( [ s ] ) satisfy eqs .",
    "( [ eqcn2])([eqcn3 ] ) for small integers @xmath104 as well , since @xmath105 as a result , for large photon occupation numbers @xmath45 the eigenfunctions ( [ psi1])([psi2 ] ) take the form latexmath:[\\ ] ]    here the superscripts @xmath137 are either @xmath43 or @xmath44 ( ground or excited state of the qd ) and subscripts @xmath138 correspond to the number of the photons in a cavity . in principle",
    ", they can take values from zero to infinity , but for numerical analysis truncation of the matrix is needed .",
    "the stronger is the pump , the more states should be taken into account .",
    "the natural way to control the accuracy of the truncation is to check the conservation of the trace of the truncated density matrix",
    ".    numerical solution of the system ( [ eqlindbladmatrix ] ) allows to find the full density matrix of the system in stationary state , @xmath139 , which allows to determine the probabilities of the occupancies of different quantum states of the coupled qd- cavity system as functions of the intensity of the external pump .",
    "as well , it allows to find the shape of the emission spectrum of the system . to pursue this latter task",
    ", we will use the two approaches .",
    "let us start with the relatively simple model based on the modified fermi golden rule , considering the isolated qd- cavity system .",
    "its eigenstates can be found by diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ eqfullhamiltonian ] ) .",
    "this procedure was performed analytically in the previous section for the cases of weak asymmetry and large photonic occupation numbers . however , in general case a numerical analysis is needed .",
    "let the system is in a pure state corresponding to one of its eigenstates .",
    "then , according to the fermi golden rule , we can estimate the emission spectrum as @xmath140 where the symbols @xmath52 denote the final and initial eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ eqfullhamiltonian ] ) , @xmath53 and @xmath54 describe zero- and one - photon states of the reservoir , @xmath141 is the hamiltonian of the coupling between the cavity and reservoir ( see eq.[eqhex ] ) , @xmath142 is the density of states in the reservoir , @xmath143 .",
    "the lorentzian factor accounts for the broadening of the state , @xmath132 , provided by finite lifetime of cavity photons .",
    "if the system is in the mixed state , the spectrum ( [ iomega1 ] ) can be estimated as a sum over all possible initial states taken with corresponding probabilities @xmath144 , @xmath145 parameters @xmath144 entering into the above expression are nothing but diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix in the stationary state written in the basis of eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ eqfullhamiltonian ] ) , @xmath146 . the matrix @xmath147 can be found by an unitary transformation of the stationary density matrix in the basis @xmath148 obtained from solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eqlindbladmatrix ] . )",
    "the described phenomenological approach for calculating the emission spectrum has one substantial drawback .",
    "namely , we assume the peaks in the spectrum to be lorentzians which is not always guaranteed @xcite . in general , according to the wiener - khintchine theorem @xcite , the spectrum of the emission from the system can be calculated as a fourier transform of two - time correlator , @xmath149 generally , the calculation of two - time correlators is a complicated task which can not be solved exactly .",
    "however , it is well - known from literature @xcite that the using of certain general assumptions about the behavior of the system allows to reduce the calculation of two - time correlators to calculation of one - time correlators within the framework of the the quantum regression theorem ( qrt ) @xcite .",
    "this means that the spectrum can be calculated straightforwardly from the density matrix of the system in stationary state . for the system we consider in the present paper , the approach based in qrt results in @xmath150_{ij , kl}^{a , b}(\\rho_{km}^{ab(ss)})a_{lm}a_{ji } , \\label{eqspectrumqrt}\\ ] ] where @xmath151 is the matrix defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eqlindbladmatrix ] ) , ( [ eqlindbladmatrixexplicit ] ) , @xmath19 is the unity matrix .",
    "iy should be noted that the expression above is valid for any choice of the basis .",
    "the shape of the emission spectrum of the system calculated using the fermi golden rule and qrt is analyzed in the following section .",
    "the emission spectrum of the system , calculated using the phenomenological approach based on the fermi golden rule , is presented in fig .",
    "[ figarbfermi ] .",
    "one sees that in the region of the frequencies close to the eigen frequency of the cavity ( coinciding with the frequency of optical transition in qd , @xmath58 ) the spectrum reveals a quadruplet pattern .",
    "the appearance of the additional multiplets is not visible in the linear scale , but becomes apparent in logarithmic scale as it is seen in fig .",
    "[ figlogfermi ] .",
    "these results are in good qualitative agreement with those obtained earlier for the symmetric qds in strong coupling regime @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising , since main difference in the emission from symmetric and asymmetric qds appears at the regions around the rabi frequency and the double frequency @xmath152 .",
    "the insets in figs .",
    "[ figarbfermi],[figlogfermi ] show the emission pattern at thz range about @xmath67 . in full agreement with results of the section",
    "ii , one sees the appearance of the peaks in the emission at frequencies @xmath153 with @xmath154 .",
    "it should be noted that one should expect very low intensities of thz emission as compare to the emission in the optical diapason , since density of states of the photon reservoir scales as @xmath155 .",
    "however , the situation can be improved if the coupled qd - cavity system is placed inside a bigger cavity tuned at the thz range . in this case",
    "the density of states has a sharp peak around the eigenfrequency of thz cavity and the rate of spontaneous emission is dramatically increased due to the purcell effect @xcite .",
    "current state of technology allows the increasing of the emission rates in the thz regime by a factor of @xmath156 in high - quality cavities @xcite .",
    "mev ; @xmath157 mev ; @xmath158 ev ; @xmath159 mev . ]    ]    the results of the calculation of the spectrum based on using the quantum regression theorem are presented in fig .",
    "[ figarbqrt ] .",
    "the part of the spectrum corresponding to the optical diapason for the frequencies about @xmath160 is in good agreement with results obtained by using the fermi golden rule ( figs .",
    "[ figarbfermi ] , [ figlogfermi ] ) .",
    "the differences are that the side peaks in the qrt plots have lower intensities , and the shape of the spectrum is more smooth , so that multiplet pattern becomes invisible .",
    "the changes in the thz part are more dramatic . instead of series of the narrow peaks shown at the inset of fig .",
    "[ figarbqrt ] one sees a formation of a single broad strongly assymmetric peak centered at a frequency @xmath161 .",
    "however , qualitative result remains the same : new optical transitions at thz range are opened by the asymmetry of the qd .    ]    the important question is statistical properties of the emitted thz light .",
    "as emission spectrum we obtain is quite large , and efficiency of thz emission is normally suppressed as compare to the emission at optical frequencies , one can expect that emitted radiation will have thermal statistics with second order coherence @xmath162 .",
    "on the other hand , placing of the sample into high quality thz cavity can lead to selection of more narrow region of the frequencies of the emission . in this case",
    "one can expect the possibility to achieve thz lasing regime with @xmath163 .",
    "the detailed consideration of this situation , however , lies beyond the scopes of the present paper . as to detection of the emitted thz radiation",
    ", it can be achieved by standard thz detectors ( see , e.g. , the review @xcite ) .",
    "in conclusion , we considered an asymmetric two - level quantum system corresponding to small asymmetric qd interacting with an electric field of a single - mode microcavity .",
    "we found analytical solutions for the eigenenergies of the system for the cases of weak asymmetry and high photon occupation numbers . as well , we developed numerical approach for the calculation of the emission spectrum under incoherent pumping .",
    "it is shown that in the regime of strong pump a new set of peaks in the emission appears in the regions close to the rabi frequency and double transition frequency .",
    "this allows to use the proposed system as nonlinear optical element and tunable source of the thz radiation .    the work was partially supported by rannis `` center of excellence in polaritonics '' , the rfbr project no .",
