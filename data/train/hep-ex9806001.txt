    "during the last 30 years the cosmic - ray muon energy spectrum has been studied in many experiments using different methods .",
    "these methods can be combined into 3 groups : i ) the direct measurements of the muon energy spectrum at the sea level using magnetic spectrometers @xcite ( the spectrum up to about 10 tev was measured at the zenith angles near horizon ) ; ii ) the measurements of the energy spectrum of cascades produced by muons at shallow depth @xcite ; iii ) the measurement of the depth  intensity curve deep underground @xcite .    since the spectrum of primary cosmic - ray nucleons has the power - law form with the power index @xmath0 , the spectrum of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons produced by primaries should have also the power - law form with the power index @xmath4 .",
    "if the scaling hypothesis is valid in the fragmentation region at high energies , the value of @xmath4 is approximately equal to @xmath0 .",
    "the muon spectrum at the sea level has a more complex form due to the competition between the interaction and decay of their parents .",
    "moreover , the flux of muons produced by pions and kaons strongly depends on the zenith angle because the interaction path length of mesons in the atmosphere varies with the zenith angle @xmath5 .",
    "the muon spectrum follows the power - law dependence only at high energies @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the critical energies of pions and kaons in the atmosphere . for @xmath9 ( vertical )",
    "this condition is quite satisfied at @xmath10 2 tev .",
    "the power index of the muon spectrum , @xmath11 , in this case is more by 1 than the value of @xmath4 .    despite the numerous experiments which studied the muon spectrum , there are the discrepancies in the published results ( values of @xmath0 , @xmath4 or @xmath11 ) .",
    "most of the experiments carried out in the last 20 years gave the values of @xmath0 ( or @xmath4 ) in the range 2.60  2.80 .",
    "but the dispersion of the results is greater than the statistical and systematic errors published by the authors .",
    "even the values of @xmath0 , obtained using one method ( for example , by the measurement of the depth - intensity curve ) have a large dispersion .",
    "such discrepancy can be due to either the difference between the data themselves , or between the calculated muon intensities used to fit the data , or both .",
    "the muon intensities deep underground have been calculated by many authors using different methods ( monte - carlo simulation of the muon transport , numerical solution of the kinetic equations etc . ,",
    "see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the discrepancy between the muon survival probabilities and , hence , between the muon intensities , calculated by different authors , is quite large and can result in the significant discrepancy between the final values of @xmath0 .",
    "the lvd ( large volume detector ) , located underground , can measure the atmospheric muon intensities from 3000 hg/@xmath12 to 12000 hg/@xmath12 and above ( which correspond to the muon energies at the sea level from 1.5 tev to 40 tev ) at the zenith angles from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "this allows us to study the muon spectrum and their characteristics at the energies 1.540 tev ( which correspond to the energies of primaries of about 10400 tev ) .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have presented our measurement of the muon depth ",
    "intensity curve and the evaluation of the power index of the meson spectrum in the atmosphere using the depth ",
    "intensity relation for single muon events .",
    "the muon survival probabilities , used to obtain the value of @xmath4 in @xcite , have been presented in @xcite .",
    "they have been calculated using the muon interaction cross - sections from @xcite .",
    "after the publication of these results , new calculation of the cross - section of muon bremsstrahlung and of the corrections to the knock - on electron production cross - section have been done @xcite . in the present analysis we have taken into account the corrections proposed in @xcite and we have estimated the uncertainties of @xmath0 ( @xmath0 is assumed to be equal to @xmath4 ) due to the uncertainties of the cross - sections used to simulate the muon transport through the rock .",
    "the analysis is based on an increased statistics comparing with the previous publications and refers to events with all muon multiplicities . in section 2 the detector and the procedure of data processing together with the conversion of the muon intensity to vertical",
    "are briefly described . in section 3",
    "the results of the analysis of the ` depth  vertical muon intensity ' distribution ( @xmath15 ) are presented . in section 4",
    "the ` depth  vertical intensity ' relation in standard rock is compared with the data of other underground experiments . in section 5",
    "we present the derived muon spectrum at sea level .",
    "section 6 contains the conclusions .",
    "the lvd ( large volume detector ) is located in the underground gran sasso laboratory at a minimal depth of about 3000 hg/@xmath12 .",
    "the lvd will consist of 5 towers .",
    "the 1st tower is running since june , 1992 , and the 2nd one - since june , 1994 .",
    "the data presented here were collected with the 1st lvd tower during 21804 hours of live time .",
    "the 1st lvd tower contains 38 identical modules @xcite .",
    "each module consists of 8 scintillation counters and 4 layers of limited streamer tubes ( tracking detector ) attached to the bottom and to one vertical side of the supporting structure .",
    "a detailed description of the detector was given in @xcite .",
    "one lvd tower has the dimensions of @xmath16 m@xmath17 .",
    "the lvd measures the atmospheric muon intensities from 3000 hg/@xmath12 to more than 12000 hg/@xmath12 ( which correspond to the median muon energies at the sea level from 1.5 tev to 40 tev ) at the zenith angles from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ( on the average , the larger depths correspond to higher zenith angles ) .",
    "we have used in the analysis the muon events with all multiplicities , as well as the sample of single muons .",
    "our basic results have been obtained with all muon sample .",
    "this sample contains about 2 millions of reconstructed muon tracks .",
    "the acceptances for each angular bin have been calculated using the simulation of muons passing through lvd taking into account muon interactions with the detector materials and the detector response .",
    "the acceptances for both single and multiple muons were assumed to be the same .    as a result of the data processing the angular distribution of the number of detected muons @xmath18 has been obtained .",
    "the angular bin width @xmath19 has been used .",
    "the analysis refers to the angular bins for which the efficiency of the muon detection and track reconstruction is greater than 0.03 .",
    "we have excluded from the analysis the angular bins with a large variation of depth .",
    "the measured @xmath18-distribution has been converted to the ` depth  vertical muon intensity ' relation , @xmath15 , using the formula :    @xmath20    where the summing up has been done over all angular bins @xmath21 contributing to the depth @xmath22 ; @xmath23 is the cross - section of the detector in the plane perpendicular to the muon track at the angles ( @xmath24 ) ; @xmath25 is the efficiency of muon detection and reconstruction ; @xmath26 is the solid angle for the angular bin ; @xmath27 is the live time ; and @xmath28 is the ratio of predicted muon intensity at @xmath29 to that at @xmath30 . to obtain the values of @xmath31 the eq .",
    "( [ gaisser spectrum ] ) ( see below ) with the previously estimated parameters of the muon spectrum at sea level @xcite and the calculated survival probabilities have been used .",
    "actually , the values of @xmath31 do not depend much on the parameters of the muon spectrum at sea level ( normalization factor @xmath32 and power index @xmath0 ) for any reasonable values of @xmath0 .",
    "the factor @xmath31 is different from the simple @xmath33 - law used to convert the muon intensities to vertical in @xcite .    in the calculations of @xmath31",
    "the contribution of the prompt muons from charmed particle decay has been neglected .",
    "as it is shown in @xcite the ratio of prompt muons to pions according to lvd data does not exceed @xmath34 at 95% confidence level .",
    "this means that at median depths ( no more than 67 km w.e . )",
    "the fraction of prompt muons with respect to conventional muons does not exceed 10% at vertical .",
    "and there is also a little probability that this fraction is more than 10% at large depths ( 8 - 10 km w.e . ) .    for depth ",
    "intensity relation the bin width of 200 m w.e . has been chosen . for depths more",
    "than 9 km w.e .",
    "the bin width was increased to 500 m w.e . to increase the statistics for each bin .",
    "the conversion of muon intensity to the middle points of each depth bin has been done using the formula :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the measured and calculated muon intensities at the weighted average depth @xmath22 which corresponds to the depth bin with the middle value of @xmath38 ; @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the derived and calculated muon intensities at the depth @xmath38 which is the middle point of the depth bin .",
    "the values of @xmath22 have been obtained by averaging the depths for all angular bins contributing to the given depth bin with a weight equal to the detected number of muons . to calculate the muon intensities at @xmath22 and @xmath38",
    "we have used again eq .",
    "( [ gaisser spectrum ] ) with the previously estimated parameters of muon spectrum @xcite and the simulated muon survival probabilities .    since the width of depth bins is quite small ( 200 m w.e .",
    "for depth bins with high statistics ) and the number of angular bins contributing to each depth bin is quite large ( several hundreds ) , the conversion factor does not exceed 10% .",
    "` depth  vertical muon intensity ' relation derived as it is described in the previous section has been fitted with the calculated distributions with 2 free parameters of the muon spectrum at sea level : normalization constant , @xmath32 , and the power index of the primary all - nucleon spectrum , @xmath0 . to calculate the muon intensities underground",
    "we have used the formula :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the survival probability of muon with an initial energy @xmath43 at sea level to reach the depth @xmath44 ; and @xmath45 is the muon spectrum at sea level at zenith angle @xmath5 .",
    "this spectrum has been taken according to @xcite :    @xmath46    where the values of @xmath47 have been substituted by @xmath48 which have been taken from @xcite . in @xcite @xmath49 , where @xmath50 are the critical energies of pions and kaons .",
    "this formula has been obtained under a simple assumption of scaling in the high - energy hadron - nucleus interactions . under this assumption",
    "the power index of primary spectrum , @xmath0 , is equal to that of meson ( pion + kaon ) spectrum , @xmath4 . to fit the ` depth  vertical intensity ' relation measured by lvd we have put @xmath51 , however , to convert the muon intensity to vertical ( as it was described in the previous section ) we have used the values of @xmath48 from @xcite .",
    "we have used the muon survival probabilities @xmath42 calculated with the muon cross - sections from @xcite and with the account of stochasticity of all processes of muon interaction with matter .",
    "they differ from those presented in @xcite and used also in @xcite ( see also references therein ) because of the new corrections for muon bremsstrahlung and knock - on electron production cross - sections proposed in @xcite ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the measured ` depth ",
    "intensity ' curve has been fitted with the calculated function ( see eq .",
    "( [ muon intensity ] ) ) with two free parameters : additional normalization constant , @xmath32 , and the power index of primary all - nucleon spectrum , @xmath0 . as a result of the fitting procedure",
    "the following values of the free parameters have been obtained : @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the results of the analysis of the depth ",
    "angular distributions @xcite .",
    "we note that the energy in eq .",
    "( [ gaisser spectrum ] ) is expressed in gev and the intensity is expressed in @xmath54 s@xmath55 sr@xmath55 .",
    "the errors of the parameters include both statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the latter one takes into account possible uncertainties in the depth , rock composition , density etc . , but does not take into account the uncertainty in the cross - sections used to simulate the muon transport through the rock . if we add the uncertainty in the muon interaction cross - sections , the error of @xmath0 will increase from 0.02 to 0.05 and the error of @xmath32 to 1.0 ( for the discussion about the uncertainty due to different cross - sections see @xcite ) .",
    "similar analysis performed for single muons reveals almost the same value of power index while the absolute intensity is 10% smaller : @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "we note that the estimates of the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath0 are strongly correlated .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath0 is , the larger the normalization factor @xmath32 should be .",
    "the ` depth  vertical muon intesity ' relation is shown in figure 1 for all muon sample together with the best fit .",
    "the muon intensities are presented also in table  [ fi : inttab ] ( column 2 ) .    if the formula from @xcite is used for the muon spectrum at sea level instead of eq .",
    "( [ gaisser spectrum ] ) , the best fit values of @xmath0 will be decreased by 0.04 - 0.05 and will be in agreement with the previously published values for single muons @xcite analysed using the formula from @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath0 obtained with lvd data is in reasonable agreement with the results of many other surface and underground experiments ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the simulations carried out for gran sasso and standard rocks allow us to obtain the formula for the conversion of the depth in gran sasso rock , @xmath58 , to that in standard rock , @xmath59 .",
    "this was done by comparing the values of @xmath59 and @xmath58 for the same muon intensity : @xmath60 .",
    "the muon intensities have been calculated with the value of @xmath0 which fit well the lvd data .",
    "the depth in standard rock can be evaluated from the depth in gran sasso rock using the formula :    @xmath61    where the depth is measured in hg/@xmath12 .",
    "this formula is valid for depth range 112 km w.e .. it has been used to convert the depth muon intensity relation measured in gran sasso rock to that in standard rock to allow the comparison with the data of other experiments .",
