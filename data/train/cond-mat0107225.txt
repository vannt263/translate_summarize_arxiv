    ", an important theoretical problem of interest is related with the property of self - averaging ( sa ) @xcite .",
    "if the system does not exhibit sa a measurement performed on a single sample does not give a meaningful result and must be repeated on many samples .",
    "a numerical study of such a system also will be quite difficult .",
    "this point has been studied recently by means of fss arguments @xcite , renormalization group ( rg ) analysis @xcite and monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the quantity under inspection is the relative variance @xmath7 .",
    "a system is said to exhibit `` strong sa '' if @xmath8 as @xmath9 .",
    "this is the case if the system is away from criticality , i.e. if @xmath10 . at the criticality ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath11 , the situation depends whether the randomness is irrelevant ( @xmath12 , e.g. `` pure '' , p - case ) or relevant ( @xmath13 , e.g. `` random '' r - case ) @xcite .",
    "one calls the former case `` weak sa '' , since @xmath14 , and the latter case `` no sa '' , since @xmath15 is fixed nonzero universal quantity even in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "the lack of sa in disordered systems implies that the standard fss breaks down .",
    "thus , one needs to formulate a fss theory , suitable for the case under consideration .",
    "there is an ongoing activity in this field but an understanding of the problems at a deeper level is still desirable @xcite .",
    "the successful application of the field theoretical methods @xcite for the analytic calculations of the size - dependent universal scaling functions for pure systems makes the possible extension of these methods very appealing also in the case of disordered systems .",
    "the appropriate field theory is the n - component @xmath16 theory with a `` random- @xmath1 '' term @xcite .",
    "the analytic difficulties raised by the disorder usually are avoided with the replica trick by solving an effective pure problem @xcite .",
    "however , the perturbative structure of the theory is still much more complicated than for the corresponding pure system , arising additional difficulties in the applicability of the ideas proposed in @xcite . some of them are of rather hard computational nature .    between the generic models for magnetism , the most popular and",
    "relatively well studied by means of monte carlo simulations is the ising model ( i.e. @xmath17 ) due to the fact that in three dimensions it is the model for which in accordance with the harris criterion , randomness is relevant .",
    "but its rg analysis is complicated as a result of the well known accidental degeneracy in the recursion relations that needs higher order in @xmath18 and so the use of the loop expansion to second order ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "this leads to the apparent computational difficulties in the finite - size treatment of the system .",
    "the @xmath18- calculations based on the loop expansion to second order are not done even for the pure finite - size systems . in this situation ,",
    "more attractive for the finite - size rg study are the disordered xy ( @xmath19 ) and heisenberg ( @xmath20 ) cases as simpler and having the same qualitative features governed in @xmath2 dimensions by a random fixed point .",
    "other problems have more basic nature and are related with the breaking of the replica symmetry ( see @xcite ) . since its deeper understanding is still lacking , they are beyond of our interest in the present study .    in this paper we analyze the finite - size properties of an n - component ( @xmath21 ) model of randomly diluted magnet with hypercubic geometry of linear size @xmath0 .",
    "exact calculations are performed in the mean - field regime @xmath22 , and up to the first order in @xmath18 near the upper critical dimension @xmath23 .",
    "although in this case , the problem of usefulness of the corresponding series expansions away from the dimension @xmath2 arises and is questionable ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) , we shall show that many generic fss properties of the model can be established and we hope this would have implications for more realistic cases .",

    "the numerical calculation of the above parameters permits also the verification of the fss and sa ( see table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "the last is shown to be absent in the regime @xmath203 , where randomness are relevant and our analysis explicitly shows that in this regime the relative variance is always non - zero for the case of stability of the rg solutions , i.e. @xmath168 and @xmath2 .",
    "one can also try to repeat the analysis without the use of the replica - trick .",

    "one can realize that this is the @xmath204 part of this term , which will give a contribution to the free - energy .",
    "this scheme permits formally to end with the same expressions for the shift of the critical temperature and the renormalization constants , as we did within the replica formalism .    in our opinion",
    ", the present fss study can be also applied in the `` canonical '' case @xcite , where the disorder is characterized by a constant total number of the occupied sites ( or bonds ) , instead of the constant average density .",
