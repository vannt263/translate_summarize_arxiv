    "it is nowadays well established that entanglement represents a fundamental resource for quantum information tasks @xcite .",
    "however , being a purely quantum feature it is fragile with respect to enviromental contamination .",
    "notwithstanding that , the possibility to achieve entangled states as stationary ones in open quantum systems has been put forward in many different contexts ( for what concern qubits systems see e.g. refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the subject has attracted a lot of attention up until a recent striking experiment on long living entanglement @xcite .",
    "the works on this topic can be considered as falling into two main categories : one where all qubits are plunged in the same environment @xcite and the other where each qubit is plunged in its own environment @xcite . in the former case",
    "the environment can provide an indirect interaction between otherwise decoupled qubits and thus a means to entangle them . in the latter case a direct interaction between qubits",
    "is needed to create entanglement , and usually to maintain it one has to also exploit other mechanisms ( state resetting , driving , etc . ) .",
    "here we consider a hybrid situation as depicted in fig.1 .",
    "it represents a sort of spin-@xmath0 chain dimerized by environments . in practice each environment induces a chain link between contiguous qubits .",
    "hence , we can expect that a simple dissipative dynamics in such a configuration is able to establish entanglement along the chain without the need to exploit any other mechanism .",
    "actually , we will show for the case of three qubits the possibility of achieving stationary entanglement for each qubits pair .",
    "the amount of entanglement results strongly dependent on the initial ( separable ) state .",
    "also the dependance from the chain boundary conditions ( open or closed ) will be analyzed as well as a left - right asymmetry in qubit - environment interaction .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following : in section ii we introduce the model relying on physical motivations and we discuss the general dynamical properties ; in section iii we restrict our attention to the three qubits case and investigate the entanglement dynamics in the open boundary condition ; in section iv we analyze the same system but with closed boundary conditions .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in section v.",
    "the model of fig.1 can be motivated by physically considering two - level atoms inside cavities connected by fibers @xcite .",
    "in such a scheme each atom - qubit can be thought as exchanging energy with the optical modes supported by the fiber . in turn",
    "this latter can modeled as an environment .",
    "thus each qubit dissipates energy through two environments ( one on the left and the other on the right ) .",
    "it happens that two contiguous qubits dissipates energy into the same environment",
    ". then this environment mediates the interaction between the contiguous qubits .",
    "more specifically , let us consider at the @xmath1th site of a chain a qubit described by ladder operators @xmath2 satisfying the usual spin-@xmath0 algebra @xmath3=\\hat{\\sigma}_i^z$ ] .",
    "let us also consider at the @xmath1th site of a chain radiation modes described by ladder operators @xmath4 satisfying the usual bosonic algebra @xmath5=\\delta_{j , j^\\prime}$ ] .",
    "then , the interaction hamiltonian reads @xmath6 by considering the @xmath7 as environment s operators for the @xmath1th qubit , we can use standard techniques @xcite to arrive at the following master equation @xmath8,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 denotes the anti - commutator and we have assumed unit decay rate .",
    "since we are interested on the steady state we have to notice that , given a master equation written in the standard linbladian form , @xmath10,\\ ] ] the uniqueness of the stationary solution is guaranteed if the only operators commuting with every lindblad operator @xmath11 are multiples of identity @xcite .    in the case of eq . the @xmath12s commute with lindblad operators .",
    "hence the steady state may not be unique , that is it may depend on the initial conditions . due to that we need to study the full dynamics of the system .",
    "we restrict our attention to a chain of three sites .",
    "we first consider open boundary conditions .",
    "then , the dynamics will be described by a master equation that can be easily derived from eq.([dyn ] ) @xmath13\\nonumber\\\\ & + & ( 1-\\gamma)\\left[2(\\hat{\\sigma}_2 ^ -+\\hat{\\sigma}_{3}^-)\\hat{\\rho } ( \\hat{\\sigma}_{2}^{+}+\\hat{\\sigma}_{3}^{+})\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.-\\{(\\hat{\\sigma}_{2}^{+}+\\hat{\\sigma}_{3}^{+})(\\hat{\\sigma}_{2}^-+\\hat{\\sigma}_{3}^-),\\hat{\\rho}\\}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have considered the possibility for each qubit of having an asymmetric decay rate on the left and right environments .",
    "this has been accounted for by the real factors @xmath14 and @xmath15 with the assumption @xmath16 .",
    "clearly the symmetric situation is recovered when @xmath17 .    by arranging the density matrix ( expressed in the computational basis @xmath18 ) as a vector @xmath19 ( e.g. writing @xmath20 )",
    ", the master equation can be rewritten as a linear set of differential equations @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a @xmath23 matrix of constant coefficients given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 with @xmath26 the @xmath27 dimensional identity matrix and @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "then , the set of differential equations can be converted into a set of algebraic equations via the laplace transform , @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath31 decoupling these equations one finds that the laplace transforms of the density matrix elements are rational functions of polynomials and the inverse laplace transformation can be performed analytically .",
    "the results are not explicitly reported because the expressions are too much cumbersome .",
    "having the density matrix of the system , we can study the entanglement dynamics for each qubit pair of the system . to quantify the amount of entanglement between each of the qubits we use the concurrence @xcite .",
    "we recall that to find the concurrence of a bipartite system described by the density matrix @xmath32 , the following steps should be done :    * find the complex conjugate of the density matrix in the computational basis and denote it by @xmath33 .",
    "* define @xmath34 , where @xmath35 . *",
    "find the square root of the eigenvalues of @xmath36 and sort them in decreasing order : @xmath37 . *",
    "the concurrence is given by @xmath38      figure [ 3e ] shows the evolution of entanglement between each qubit pair for @xmath39 initial state . as it can be seen in this figure , when all the qubits are initially in excited state it takes longer time for the first and the third qubits to become entangled compared to the time needed to generate entanglement between the first and second or second and third qubits . as a consequence for not nearest neighborhood qubits we have a _ sudden birth of entanglement _ , i.e. it suddenly becomes non zero at times greater than zero ( it does not smoothly increases starting from initial time ) @xcite .",
    "initial state . dashed line :",
    "@xmath40 , solid line : @xmath41 and dotted line : @xmath42 . ]",
    "if we start with different initial states , the entanglement behaves differently in time .",
    "figure [ 2e]-left shows the value of concurrence in time for @xmath43 as initial state . like the previous case , it shows that the time needed by the first and third qubits to become entangled is longer than the time needed by nearest neighborhood qubits .",
    "moreover , we still have the entanglement sudden birth phenomenon , but this time it manifests not only for distant qubits ( first and third ) but also for the first and the second qubits . the interesting point in this figure",
    "is that the entanglement generation between the nearest neighbors is quicker if they are initially prepared in @xmath44 rather than @xmath45 state .",
    "the other possibility with two number of excitations in the initial state is @xmath46 , for which the time evolution of entanglement in shown in figure [ 2e]-right .",

    "figures [ 1e]-left and - right show entanglement evolution for the initial states @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . as it can be seen in this figure",
    ", entanglement is generated between each qubits pair from the beginning , no matter how far they are from each other , i.e. we no more have entanglement sudden birth phenomenon .",
    "finally , in the case of @xmath51 initial state there is no entanglement at any time because this state represent a fixed point of the liouvillian superoperator at right hand side of the master equation , or in other words @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "taking the limit @xmath54 in the density matrix elements , we arrive at the following general form for the steady state @xmath55 where @xmath56 is determined by the initial state of the system .",
    "in particular we have the following correspondence : @xmath57 to find the amount of entanglement in each qubits pair at the steady state , we first write the reduced density matrices @xmath58 @xmath59     for different initial states . ]",
    "then , it is easy to show that the concurrence becomes @xmath60 figure ( [ mathematicasteady ] ) shows the stationary entanglement vs @xmath14 for different initial state . for initial states like @xmath61 the entanglement does not depend on @xmath14 . for @xmath62 initial state , by increasing the difference in the dissipation rates more entanglement will be induced in the system . on the contrary for @xmath47 the maximum value of entanglement",
    "is achieved when the dissipation rates into the two environments are the same . as it is expected the entanglement for initial states",
    "@xmath63 are equal at @xmath64 . in these cases ,",
    "the maximum value can be attained when there is one excitation in the initial state .",
    "we now study the chain of three sites with closed boundary condition . in this case",

    "clearly the symmetric situation is recovered when @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) .    again arranging the density matrix ( expressed in the computational basis @xmath18 ) as a vector @xmath19 ( e.g. writing @xmath20 ) ,",

    "hence no entanglement survive at stationary conditions .",
    "in this work we have considered a spin-@xmath0 chain dimerized by environments . by means of dissipative mechanism , each environment induces a chain link between contiguous qubits .",
    "then we have studied the possibility of having long living entanglement without resorting to any other mechanism .",
    "in particular for the case of three qubits chain with open boundary condition we have classified the amount of stationary entanglement accordingly to some initial ( separable ) states .",
    "here we have also shown the appearance of the entanglement sudden birth .",
    "on the contrary , for the case of three qubits chain with closed boundary condition we have proved the impossibility of stationary entanglement .",
    "this fact can be interpreted as entanglement frustration phenomenon @xcite , induced in this context by the imposed periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the proposed scheme lends itself to to be extended to @xmath78 sites where one can evaluate how entanglement scales as function of the distance between the two qubits .",
    "moreover , in the limit of large @xmath79 , it could also results useful for studying possible connections between quantum phase transitions and reservoirs properties .",
    "finally , the discussed method of generating entanglement seems economical and offers interesting perspectives for the generation of the so called graph states ( useful for measurement based quantum compuatation ) @xcite , when one considers a network topologies more complicate than a simple chain .",
