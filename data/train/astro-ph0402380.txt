    "the galactic x - ray binary gx  3394  was discovered @xmath330 years ago ( markert et al .",
    "1973 ) , and it has been extensively studied since then . its optical companion is undetectable and most of the observed optical emission originates in an accretion disc . the system is classified as a low - mass x - ray binary from upper limits on the luminosity of the companion star ( e.g. , shahbaz , fender & charles 2001 ) .",
    "gx  3394  is a transient source exhibiting state transitions between soft , hard and off states .",
    "based on its temporal and spectral characteristics , it is considered to be a black hole binary ( sunyaev & revnivtsev 2000 ; zdziarski et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter z98 ) , which is in agreement with an estimate of its mass function @xmath4 at the 95 per cent confidence ( hynes et al .  2003 ) .",
    "most of its x@xmath5-ray spectra in luminous states are remarkably similar to those of cyg x-1 , and well fitted by comptonization ( z98 ; wardziski et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter w02 ) . however ,",
    "while the two sources share common properties on time scales @xmath6 a few days , their evolution patterns are rather different on longer time scales ( e.g. , smith , heindl & swank 2002b ) . in particular , the spectral evolution of cyg x-1 is directly correlated with the luminosity changes , whereas the spectral changes in gx  3394  have been observed to lag the variations of the luminosity .",
    "these lags constitute a hysteresis in the lightcurve of the source ; the hard - to - soft state transitions during the rise phase occur at higher luminosities than the soft - to - hard ones during the decline phase .",
    "a major difference between gx  3394  and cyg x-1 is that the latter is a persistent source in a high - mass x - ray binary .",
    "thus , accretion in cyg x-1 is via a focused wind from the high - mass companion , while in gx  3394  it is due to roche - lobe overflow from the low - mass companion .",
    "the different behaviour of low and high - mass black - hole binaries is likely to be due to different disc sizes ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2002b ) . in a low - mass x - ray binary",
    ", the disc is expected to be large .",
    "this then leads to delays in the propagation of the accretion rate from the disc outer regions to the hot inner flow .",
    "another consequence of the different types of accretion flows in the two systems is that whereas cyg x-1 is a persistent source , in which the bolometric luminosity ( and presumably the accretion rate ) varies only by @xmath15 or so ( zdziarski et al .  2002 , hereafter z02 ) ,",
    "gx  3394  is a transient , in which accretion is unstable and the accretion rate in the vicinity of the black hole varies by at least several orders of magnitude .",
    "consequently , gx  3394  goes through a wider range of spectral states than cyg x-1 .    in this paper",
    ", we first estimate the distance to the source based on recent optical / ir data .",
    "then we study the long - term variability of gx  3394  during 19872004 and its theoretical interpretation .",
    "we use data from the all - sky monitors ( asm ) on board _ ginga _ and _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ satellites , the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) _ , and the currrently available data from the proportional counter array ( pca ) and high - energy transient x - ray experiment ( hexte ) on board _",
    "the distance , @xmath7 , to a source is , obviously , of major importance for interpretation of its observations .",
    "therefore , we update here the constraints obtained by z98 .",
    "they obtained @xmath8 kpc based on the extinction , which , however , does not impose an upper limit . in particular , there is a star at @xmath18 kpc within @xmath9 of gx  3394  with less extinction than it ( fig .   1 of z98 ) .",
    "on the other hand , z98 found a kinematic distance of @xmath10 kpc , but they noted that this result was less secure than the extinction limit due to a possible peculiar velocity of the system ( see below ) .    based on vlt observations of gx  3394 , shahbaz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimated the relative contribution of the secondary to the gunn @xmath11-band magnitude as @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the secondary must have an @xmath11-band magnitude @xmath321.4 ( note an error in shahbaz et al .",
    ", who quoted a value of 20.4 on p.  l19 ) , which corresponds , after correcting for @xmath13 ( z98 ) , to a late k - type star with an apparent diameter of @xmath14 , where we assumed the effective temperature of @xmath15 .",
    "this estimate is also consistent with the lowest recorded near - ir magnitudes ( work in preparation ) . in particular , @xmath16 observed in 2003 jan.feb .",
    "( buxton & bailyn 2004 ) , combined with the upper limit on the @xmath17 magnitude of shahbaz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is consistent with an early m - type star with @xmath18 .",
    "since the system is a lmxb and the secondary is filling its roche lobe , the mass ratio , @xmath19 , is given by ( eggleton 1983 ) , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the secondary s radius and @xmath22 is the separation . adopting then the orbital parameters of hynes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , namely the secondary semi - amplitude of @xmath23 , the period @xmath24 d , and @xmath25 , we obtain @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the inclination .",
    "the distance is then @xmath30 , which is @xmath31 kpc for @xmath14 .",
    "the system is not eclipsing , so @xmath32 .",
    "on the other hand , the relatively large secondary mass function and the presence of moderate orbital modulation of the @xmath33 light during its optically - high state ( work in preparation ) , is inconsistent with a very low @xmath29 .",
    "assuming then a plausible lower limit of @xmath34 , we obtain then an inclination - dependent lower limit on @xmath7 of @xmath35    this result is consistent with the recent lower limit of @xmath36 kpc for the kinematic distance of hynes et al .",
    "( 2004 ) based on analysis of high - resolution optical spectra of the na d lines .",
    "specifically , they find at least 9 line components arising from different clouds located along the line of sight .",
    "they derive a range of mean cloud velocity of @xmath37 to @xmath38 km s@xmath39 , which they attribute to the galactic rotation , and argue that gx  3394  lies at or beyond the tangent point , i.e. , @xmath40 kpc .",
    "they also suggest that the slightly positive systemic velocity of gx  3394  and the presence of the absorption component in na d lines with positive velocity , 2535 km s@xmath39 , indicates a location close to the solar circle on the far side of the galaxy , i.e. , at @xmath41 kpc , which distance they favour .",
    "although they note that for such a large @xmath7 , gx  3394  would be at a @xmath42 kpc below the galactic plane , they still associate gx  3394  and the redshifted absorption with the warped material of the outer galactic disc .    however , we prefer the location in the galactic bulge for the following reasons .",
    "( i ) the analysis of high resolution spectra na d and ca k lines towards ob stars ( sembach et al .  1993 ) revealed similar redshifted components in most of their sample stars located in the galactic bulge , at @xmath43 kpc , @xmath44 .",
    "( ii ) the maximum galactic disc warping on the southern hemisphere corresponds to the azimuthal angle of @xmath45 , where the warping starts at the radial distance from the galactic center of @xmath46 kpc and the hi disc is bending down to @xmath47 kpc at @xmath48 kpc ( nakanishi & sofue 2003 ) .",
    "since both @xmath49 and @xmath17 are the galactocentric coordinates , gx 3394 can not be associated with this warped material because at a distance of @xmath50 kpc , its @xmath51 and @xmath52 kpc .",
    "moreover , @xmath49 increases with the increasing @xmath7 , and a larger @xmath7 would locate gx 3394 even farther away from the galactic plane .",
    "( iii ) the rather high peculiar velocity ( @xmath1140 km s@xmath39 if gx  3394  lies at the tangent point , hynes et al .",
    "2004 ) is not unusual if gx  3394  is a member of the spheroidal galactic bulge population .",
    "thus , we hereafter use @xmath53 kpc , compatible with the location in the galactic bulge . using equation ( [ d_min ] ) ,",
    "this is also compatible with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , given the mass function of @xmath56 of hynes et al .",
    "we note that the relatively strong compton reflection measured in x - ray spectra of gx  3394  ( e.g. , z98 ; w02 ; corongiu et al .  2003 ) appears incompatible with @xmath57 ; however , an investigation of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the _ ginga_/asm ( tsunemi et al .  1989 ) monitored gx  3394  in the 120 kev band from 1987 march 6 to 1991 october 2 , and the countrate lightcurve was presented in kong et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . here",
    "we use instead energy fluxes in the bands of 11.6 , 1.63.3 , 3.35.0 , 5.012.5 , and 12.519.8 kev converted from the instrumental counts using the response matrix of tsunemi et al .",
    "( 1989 ) .    using eq .",
    "( 1 ) of z02 , we measure the hardness across two adjacent energy bands in those and subsequent data by a photon spectral index , @xmath58 , corresponding to a power law that would yield the same hardness ratio as observed .",
    "even if the actual spectrum is different from a power law , this @xmath58 still gives a measure of the overall hardness across the two energy bands that avoids the dependence on their relative sizes .",
    "we do not correct for the interstellar absorption ( @xmath59 @xmath60 , z98 ) .",
    "this results in the values of @xmath58 at @xmath63 kev being somewhat lower than the intrinsic ones .    the used _ rxte_/asm ( levine et al .",
    "1996 ) data cover the interval of 1996 january 62004 january 29 . during that time ,",
    "gx  3394  was observed by the asm @xmath110 times a day on average with each ( dwell ) exposure of 90 s. here , we use the data binned over one day ( from xte.mit.edu/asm ) .",
    "the daily averages are based on dwell data selected using a number of criteria ( see that web page ) , in particular the @xmath61 of the solution . here",
    ", we have imposed an additional criterion of the minimum of 4 dwells per day ( derived using the asm crab data ) , to avoid possible spurious fluctuations .",
    "the asm data have a positive bias of 1 mcrab ( heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) , which we have removed based on the average asm crab counts .",
    "we then convert the instrumental counts into energy fluxes in the ranges of 1.53 , 35 , and 512 kev using the conversion matrix given by eq .",
    "( a1 ) of z02 , derived based on cyg x-1 data , but applicable to gx  3394  as the conversion is independent of the direction .",
    "for this work , we have additionally confirmed its correctness using crab data .",
    "we have compared the asm crab data with the _",
    "bepposax_/mecs data ( from www.asdc.asi.it ) acquired on 1997 october 8 .",
    "we have found that the asm conversion gives the energy fluxes in the above bands @xmath62 per cent higher than the mecs data .",
    "this is a discrepancy smaller than typical ones between various x - ray instruments ( e.g.  30 per cent for hexte vs.  pca ) .",
    "then , the obtained 312 kev effective spectral index for the asm data is in the 2.042.10 range for 200-day averages , in good agreement with @xmath63 for the mecs data . on the other hand ,",
    "the mecs data give the effective ( absorbed ) @xmath645 kev@xmath65 , somewhat softer than the range obtained for asm of 1.791.97 .",
    "the low relative level of this discrepancy can be illustrated by the fact that it can be completely removed if we modify the lower energy bound from 1.5 kev to 1.55 kev .",
    "in addition , the asm indices above 3 kev of gx  3394  are in excellent agreement with those from the pca , see below .    the batse instrument aboard _ cgro _ monitored the x@xmath5-ray sky 1991 may 312000 may 25 .",
    "it used earth occultation to identify point sources ( e.g. , harmon et al .",
    "2002 ) . on average , 1215 occultations of gx  3394   were observed daily .",
    "we use the data binned on a one - day timescale , and reject days with @xmath66 occultations . we use four energy bins , 2040 , 4070 , 70160 and 160430 kev .",
    "the counts have been converted to energy fluxes based on the crab observations of jung ( 1989 ) , with the resulting conversion coefficients from countrate to energy flux for the four bands of 7.567 , 5.830 , 8.079 , @xmath67 erg , respectively .    given that gx  3394  is a transient source , the data cover wide ranges of fluxes , and often are of limited statistics .",
    "we have then rebinned adjacent ( i.e. , avoiding averaging over large gaps ) time bins until achieving a specified accuracy in the 1030 per cent ( 10@xmath68 ) range ( depending on the considered case ) , weighing the fluxes with the inverse square error .",
    "however , during the off states , achieving those accuracies would require averaging over a very large number of days and often extending the average to include a part of a luminous state .",
    "thus , we also limited the maximum number of averaged days to 100200 .",
    "we sum the fluxes and their square errors when adding adjacent energy channels .",
    "we also analyze all currently available pca and hexte data , following the method of done & gierliski ( 2003 , hereafter dg03 ) .",
    "we extract one pca ( detectors 0 , 2 and 3 , top layer only , except for observations since mjd 52763 , when only detectors 0 and 2 were available ) and hexte ( cluster 0 ) spectrum per pointed observation , using ftools 5.3 .",
    "we then fit the resulting 236 spectra with positive detections by a model consisting of a blackbody disc and thermal comptonization , thcomp ( zdziarski , magdziarz & johnson 1996 ) .",
    "the effects of compton reflection are approximated by adding smeared edge and gaussian line .",
    "the model is absorbed by @xmath69 @xmath60 .",
    "we use the resulting unabsorbed ( unlike the case of the asm data ) energy fluxes in the 34 , 46.4 , 6.49.7 and 9.716 kev energy bands ( as in dg03 ) , normalized to the pca . as above",
    ", we convert the hardness ratios to the average spectral indices .",
    "this method proved to give robust and fairly model - independent fluxes as long as the model gives an adequate spectral fit , with @xmath70 ( dg03 ) .",
    "this is the case for most of the data , except for a few soft - state spectra ( with @xmath713 ) , where the high - energy tail can not be properly reproduced by thermal comptonization , an indication of the non - thermal emission present in soft states ( see e.g.  gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ; zdziarski et al .",
    "this , however , very weakly affects neither the 316 kev flux nor the bolometric one ( see below ) .",
    "we also use the model bolometric flux , @xmath72 , for these data .",
    "the systematic error related to the uncertainty in the method of calculating @xmath72 is not included in its quoted error ( based only on the countrate error ) .",
    "[ pca_flux ] shows the resulting relation between the 316 kev flux ( with low systematic errors ) to the obtained model bolometric flux .",
    "we see two different relationships in the hard and soft states , related to the distinctly different intrinsic spectra of the two states , peaking at @xmath1100 kev and @xmath11 kev , respectively ( see , e.g. , zdziarski & gierliski 2004 for a recent review ) .    finally , we note that we do not study differences in absolute flux calibration of different instruments .",
    "this adds a systematic error to the relative level of different lightcurves .",

    "[ lc_all ] .    then , the variability pattern changed again with gx  3394  entering an extended soft state lasting for @xmath80 d. after its decline , a hard state took place , and then the source gradually faded .",

    "a likely cause of this difference is the behaviour before the soft state . before the first outburst ,",
    "gx  3394  underwent an extended period of a variable hard state , during which its broad - band flux was persistently relatively high for @xmath88 d , whereas the second outburst followed a @xmath88 d period of the off state , see fig .",

    "[ outbursts](b ) . on the other hand , the pca / hexte data favour a slightly later soft - to - hard transition day , mjd 52731 , consistent with a softening of the 312 kev asm spectrum after the hardening on mjd 52725 .",
    "apart from the different maximum fluxes in the two outbursts , another remarkable property is the varying flux level corresponding to transitions between the states .",
    "the hard - to - soft transition of the second outburst occured at the level higher by a factor of @xmath13 ( similar to the ratio between the maximum 1.512 kev fluxes of the two outbursts ) than that of the first one . in both cases , this level was higher than that of the soft - to - hard transition , which happened at the very similar flux levels for both outbutsts .    the lagging of the effect in a physical system when the acting force is changed is called hysteresis . in the present case , the acting force is apparently the accretion rate and the effect is the spectral state .",
    "the presence of hysteresis in gx  3394  has been found before by , e.g. , miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , smith et al .",

    "( 2004 ) in some other black - hole and neutron - star binaries .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ outbursts ] that the 312 and 316 kev fluxes change only slightly but the 1.55 kev one changes by a large factor during each state transition .",
    "this implies a transition pivot at @xmath110 kev , similarly to cyg x-1 ( zhang et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "another interesting effect is seen during the soft - to - hard transitions .",
    "namely , the hardening of the 312 kev spectrum is accompanied by an initial softening of the 1.55 kev one during the first outburst , see figs .",
    "[ outbursts](a ) .",
    "such softening is also seen in the 36.4 kev spectrum near the end of the second soft state , see fig .",
    "[ outbursts](d ) .",
    "this effect likely corresponds to disappearance of inner parts of the optically - thick disc when its luminosity declines at the end of a soft state .",
    "then , at the beginning of a hard state , a strong soft excess is still present in the spectrum .",
    "fig .  [ asm_index ] presents correlations in the asm data , including those shown in fig .",
    "[ outbursts](a  b ) .",
    "we plot the indices decreasing along the axes to keep a correspondence to hardness ratio diagrams . in the 1.55 kev range ,",

    "evolution is clockwise , see fig .",
    "[ asm_index](b ) .",
    "the second outburst is extended to fluxes higher than the first .",
    "interestingly , both the hard and soft state ( defined based on the 312 kev spectrum ) occupy similar ranges of the 1.55 kev spectral indices and differ mostly in their fluxes .",
    "this situation reverses in the 312 kev range , see figs .",
    "[ asm_index](c ) , ( d ) .",
    "the hard state occupies an almost horizontal strip for @xmath892 clearly separated from the soft state but the range of @xmath72 is similar in both states , only slightly shifted to higher values for the soft state .",
    "in fact , the first soft state ( red symbols ) shows fluxes typically lower than the hard state preceding the second soft state .",
    "there is at most slight @xmath90 correlation in the hard state , with the best fit slope of @xmath91 .",
    "we note , however , that our @xmath92 does not separate the compton reflection component , which strength positively correlates with the intrinsic slope ( ueda , ebisawa & done 1994 ; revnivtsev , gilfanov & churazov 2001 ) .",
    "thus , the range of variability of the intrinsic @xmath58 will be slightly larger than that shown in fig .",
    "[ asm_index](c ) .",
    "[ asm_index](d ) shows clearly the presence of hysteresis , with the transitions to the soft state occuring at much larger fluxes than those of out that state .",
    "a part of the horizontal extent covered in each state is due to this effect , in which the spectrum remains relatively stable within a large range of the flux .",
    "we also see a separation between the regions corresponding to the two outbursts , consistent with the difference between their flux scale , fig .",
    "[ outbursts ] .    in both 1.55 and 312 kev bands ,",
    "the spectral index is anticorrelated with the flux in the soft states , and the anticorrelation is much stronger during the second outburst ( black symbols ) .",
    "this effect is probably caused by the spectral shape varying due to the variable amplitude of the high energy tail beyond the blackbody component ( as it is the case in cyg x-1 , z02 ) .",
    "for many points , especially during the first outburst , the 312 kev power law is very soft , up to @xmath93 , i.e. , the emission in the tail becomes very weak .",
    "[ asm_index](e ) , ( f ) show the corresponding colour - colour diagram .",
    "the two indices are positively correlated in the soft state , which simply means that softening at lower energies is accompanied by softening at higher energies . the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ asm_index](e ) corresponds to the two indices being equal .",
    "thus , we see that in the soft state the 312 kev spectrum is in most cases softer than the 1.55 kev one .",
    "this softening at high energies probably corresponds to both the cutoff in the disc blackbody entering the range of energies @xmath33 kev and absorption .",
    "our strongest hard - state ( anti)correlation involves the 1.55 and 312 kev spectral indices , see fig .",

    "2003 ) , the difference between the hard state of atoll and black - hole binaries in their colour - colour diagrams at energies @xmath973 kev ( with the former and latter forming horizontal and diagonal regions ) can not be attributed solely to the cooling action of the neutron star surface , which was proposed by dg03 . instead",
    ", the difference is , at least partly , related to the different blackbody temperature , @xmath98 , in the two classes of sources .",
    "the upper horizontal branch appears due to the disc blackbody emission affecting the colours , which obviously depends on the maximum @xmath98 .",
    "this temperature is significantly higher in neutron - star systems due to their lower masses , and thus the effect of blackbody emission is seen above 3 kev , whereas it is not seen in black - hole systems with a lower temperature .",

    "note that the pivoting variability also contributes to a part of the softening of the 20160 kev slopes with increasing flux .",
    "however , this softening can not be solely due to pivoting as its degree increases with the photon energy , opposite to the pivoting , where the @xmath72-@xmath58 correlation becomes stronger in the opposite direction , i.e. , away from the pivot energy .",
    "we then considered the joint asm / batse simultaneous data , dominated by the hard state .",

    "[ rms ] .    during the hard state ,",
    "the fractional rms of the asm data decreases with energy .",
    "then , there is a slight increase of the rms from the last asm channel to the first batse one .",
    "this may be due to the presence of variable compton reflection ( e.g. , revnivtsev et al .",

    "we have made the periodogram for the batse data constrained to those three outbursts , mjd @xmath113 , and obtained results virtually identical to those in fig .",

    "thus , we consider it likely that the 220 d period corresponds to the precession of the accretion disc in the system .",
    "this issue certainly deserves further study , which , however , is beyond the scope of this paper .    on the other hand",
    ", no @xmath1220 d peak appears in either the entire _ rxte_/asm data set or the data constrained to any of the two recent soft outbursts .",

    "we have also searched for modulation corresponding to the orbital period , @xmath114 d. we have not found any in the asm data for either the hard ( fig .   [ period ] ) or the soft states . on the other hand , there is a clear peak at @xmath115 d , which is also present in the asm data for other sources , e.g. , cyg x-1 ( lachowicz et al .",

    "it is an artefact related to the scheduling cycle of the _ rxte _ observations , in particular many pointings with a 1-day periodicity , e.g. , during numerous agn monitoring campaigns .",
    "coupling of this periodicity with long - term secular changes introduces a powerful signal at @xmath11 d.",
    "as our results above show , there are many important similaraties and differences between gx  3394  and cyg x-1 .",
    "\\(i ) cyg x-1 shows no hysteresis .",
    "state transitions in that source follow the same trajectory in each direction on index - flux and index - index diagrams ( z02 ) . the presence of hysteresis in gx  3394  is certainly related to its overall range of variability ( and presumably the accretion rate ) much wider than in cyg x-1 , both in terms of the fluxes and spectral indices .",
    "\\(ii ) the 312 kev spectral index in the hard state correlates with the corresponding flux much less in gx  3394  ( fig .",
    "[ asm_index]c ) , than in cyg x-1 ( fig .",
    "4b in z02 ) .",
    "however , the range of this @xmath58 in the hard state is almost the same in both source , @xmath11.22.0 , whereas the range of the flux is @xmath9710 times higher in gx  3394 .",
    "this then explains the weaker dependence .",
    "the correlation in cyg x-1 was interpreted by z02 as due to variable source geometry in the hard state , with a variable relative rate of cooling of the comptonizing plasma .",
    "such variable geometry is also likely to be present in gx  3394 , governing its spectral hardness , but with an additional hysteretic dispersion of the hard - state flux .",
    "\\(iii ) the 312 kev and 1.55 kev indices in the hard state are anticorrelated in gx  3394  ( resembing some atoll sources ) , whereas they are strongly positively correlated in cyg x-1 ( fig .  5 in z02 ) .",
    "this differerence is likely to be related to the @xmath98 in the hard state being much higher in gx  3394  than in cyg x-1 . indeed , corongiu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) obtain @xmath116 kev in the hard state of gx  3394 , compared to @xmath117 kev in cyg x-1 ( di salvo et al .",

    "( 2003 ) found only a single power law necessary . ] .",
    "then , the variability pattern of the blackbody emission ( see section [ hard ] ) affects the asm band much more in gx  3394  than in cyg x-1 .",
    "\\(iv ) the hard - state fluxes in bands from 20 to 160 kev are positively correlated with the local spectral indices in gx  3394 .",
    "the sign of the correlation changes above 160 kev , indicating a pivot around this energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the hard - state pivot in cyg x-1 is at a lower energy , @xmath150 kev ( z02 ) . as discussed by zdziarski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , a pivot at energies close to the high - energy cutoff ( or higher ) indicates the behaviour in which an increase of the power in soft photons providing seeds for thermal comptonization is accompanied by an increase of the power supplied to the hot comptonizing plasma . in the case of cyg x-1 , that power is close to constant in the hard state on long time scales ( unlike gx  3394 ) .",
    "we also note that cyg x-1 shows a pivot at @xmath1120 kev similar to that of gx  3394  when studied on hour time scales ( bazzano et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "\\(v ) consistent with the pivot at high energies , the hard - state batse data show the rms decreasing with energy , unlike cyg x-1 , where it has a minimum and then increases again above 100 kev ( z02 ) .",
    "\\(vi ) in the soft state , the flux - index anticorrelation observed in cyg x-1 was explained by z02 as a result of constant luminosity in the soft component and varying luminosity of the hard , power - law spectrum .",
    "the stronger the power - law , the less visible the cutoff in the soft component and thus the harder spectrum . in gx",
    "3394 , this behaviour is also seen in the two soft outbursts ( fig  [ asm_index ] ) . however , the blackbody flux is also variable in gx  3394  ( fig .  [ outbursts ] ) .",
    "\\(vii ) the dependence of the rms on energy in the first soft outburst is similar in gx  3394  and in cyg x-1 during its 1996 soft state ( z02 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the second soft state shows the daily time scale rms higher than that of cyg x-1 in any of its soft states .",
    "\\(viii ) no modulation of x - rays with the orbital period is present in gx  3394  in any state , compared to the strong modulation of soft x - rays in the hard state of cyg x-1 ( e.g. , wen et al .  1999 ) .",
    "this is again likely to be related to the different nature of the accretion flow in the two objects .",
    "no x - ray eclipses or dips in gx  3394  is due to inflow of matter being contained in the roche - lobe overflow , unlike the case of the wind accretion in cyg x-1 .",
    "our results show that luminosity changes in gx  3394  are not simultaneous with changes of the spectral shape .",
    "obviously , a physical model to describe this behaviour is desired .",
    "the data with best time coverage we have are from the _ rxte_/asm instrument , which , however , provides us only with information in three channels in the limited energy band of 1.512 kev . given that , our theoretical model should be rather simple .",
    "thus , we have developed a model of an accretion flow composed of an inner , hot , optically thin disc and an outer , cold , optically thick one with only two free parameters .",
    "the first of them is the accretion rate ( assumed constant throughout the flow ) , which also represents the normalization of the spectrum , and the second , the transition radius between the hot and cold disc .",
    "the dimensionless accretion rate is defined in the standard way ( e.g. , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) as @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the accretion rate and @xmath120 is the eddington luminosity , @xmath121 then @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is an accretion efficiency .",
    "we assume that an optically thick disc of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) extends down to a radius @xmath124 , expressed in the units of gravitational radius , @xmath125 .",
    "the luminosity of the disc ( in soft blackbody radiation ) is @xmath126 below @xmath124 , we assume the flow becomes optically thin .",
    "this is intended to approximate optically thin accretion , e.g. , cooling - dominated hot flows ( shapiro , lightman & eardley 1976 ) , adaf ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1996 ) or cdaf ( e.g. , narayan , igumenshchev & abramowicz 2000 ) .",
    "we assume the luminosity of the optically thin flow is @xmath127 i.e. , take the radiative efficiency of the hot disc equal to that of the cold one assuming no dissipation below @xmath128 .",
    "this yields the accretion efficiency of @xmath129 .    the spectrum of the optically thick , outer",
    ", disc is approximated as a blackbody with the total luminosity of @xmath130 .",
    "the colour temperature , @xmath98 , is calculated from the temperature of the shakura - sunyaev disc at @xmath124 , with the inner zero - torque boundary condition neglected for simplicity , @xmath131 where the colour correction of @xmath132 is assumed ( shimura & takahara 1995 ) .",
    "since the inclination of gx  3394  is unknown , we consider here the angle - averaged emission .    for the hot disc spectrum we assume an exponentially cut off power law , which approximates the spectrum produced by unsaturated comptonization of photons emitted by the disc .",
    "the power - law photon index is , @xmath133 ( beloborodov 1999 ) where @xmath134 depends on the temperature of seed photons , with @xmath135 for stellar - mass black holes , and where we have assumed a half of the blackbody photons is comptonized in the hot flow ( and the other half escapes unscattered ) .",
    "the normalization of the power - law spectrum at the energy of the peak of the blackbody spectrum is calculated using eq .",
    "( 7 ) in zdziarski ( 1986 ) .",
    "the energy of the cutoff in the power - law spectrum ( depending on the electron temperature ) is calculated by the normalization of that spectrum given by @xmath136 .",
    "we note that our model allows for any @xmath124 ( @xmath137 ) for a given @xmath138 .",
    "thus , it allows for either soft or hard state to take place at a given accretion rate , consistent with our observational result of hysteresis in gx  3394 .",
    "we have implemented the above model into the xspec package ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "the _ rxte_/asm fluxes ( in physical units and rebinned to @xmath73 significance , see section [ data ] ) were converted to fits - format files , assuming a diagonal response matrix .",
    "the above model was then fitted to the data assuming @xmath53 kpc , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 @xmath60 .",

    "thus , our best estimate of the average flux is @xmath178 erg @xmath60 s@xmath39 , which corresponds to @xmath179 . due to systematic errors ( e.g. , in the absolute calibration of the batse )",
    ", the numerical coefficient above may be somewhat lower , @xmath10.01 .",
    "this @xmath180 clearly corresponds to accretion in this source being strongly unstable .",
    "the average batse flux during the next epoch , mjd 4950050800 , characterized by weaker and more often hard otbursts with higher minimum fluxes , had then the average flux of about 1.6 times the preceding one , corresponding to @xmath181 .    a further increase lead to the first of the two recent soft states .",
    "we estimated the bolometric correction based on the pca data , which yielded @xmath182 erg @xmath60 s@xmath39 during its duration .",
    "this soft outburst apparently emptied the inner region of matter , and a @xmath11000 d off state followed .",
    "the accumulated matter powered the last strong outburst , with @xmath183 of its soft state of about twice the preceding one , and a @xmath1300 d duration .",
    "averaging from the beginning of the first outburst ( mjd 50800 ) until now mjd 53000 yields @xmath184 erg @xmath60 s@xmath39 , corresponding to @xmath185 , i.e. , about three and two times that during the preceding epochs , mjd 4840049500 and 4950050800 , respectively .",
    "this indicates variability of the accretion rate on the time scale of @xmath88 d.    interestingly , the average luminosity , @xmath183 , during the initial outbursts observed by batse , @xmath1(0.010.015)@xmath186 , is very similar to that of the hard state in a number of persistent sources , e.g. , cyg x-1 , where @xmath187 during 199194 ( z02 ) , but also in 1e 1740.72942 and grs 1758258 ( heindl & smith 1998 ) . in the case of cyg x-1 , its stability as opposed to the instability of gx  3394  may be related to the different sizes of accretion discs in those systems .",
    "the instabilities in gx  3394  certainly develop in the outer disc , whereas the accretion disc in cyg x-1 may form out of the quasispherical wind relatively close to the black hole ( beloborodov & illarionov 2001 ; illarionov & beloborodov 2001 ) .      the hysteresis in gx  3394  is obviously related to the existence of a range of @xmath170 at which two stable accretion solutions , optically thick and optically thin , exist .",
    "the state of the source in a given moment is then determined not solely by @xmath170 but also by the past history .",
    "the maximum possible luminosity of the hard state is larger than the minimum possible luminosity of the soft state .",
    "we could then expect the transitions to / out of the soft state to appear simply at the limiting luminosities .",
    "the transition out of the soft state did take place in a narrow range of @xmath170 during the last two outbursts .",
    "such a uniformity is also characteristic to other sources ( maccarone 2003 ) .",
    "this luminosity is likely to represent the minimum possible soft state @xmath170 , limited probably by evaporation ( e.g. , raska & czerny 2000 ; meyer , liu & meyer - hofmeister 2000 ) . in this case , the past history determining the source behaviour is simply the presence of an optically - thick disc .",
    "however , it is less clear what determines the moment of collapse of the hard - state hot flow and its transformation into an optically - thick disc .",
    "the luminosity at which this happens varied by a factor of @xmath13 between the two last outbursts of gx  3394 .",
    "the cause of this difference appears to be the previous history of the source .",
    "the transition to the first of the two soft states happened after several years of sustained hard - state activity . on the other hand ,",
    "the second outburst followed a @xmath11000 d of quiescence .",
    "one possibility is that the inner radius of the outer cold disc was much closer to the black hole when the @xmath119 started to increase leading to the first soft outburst .",
    "before the second one , the cold disc was initially much further out , and its buildup towards lower radii did not keep pace with the rapidly increasing local accretion rate .",
    "this , in turn , allowed a much higher luminosity in the hard state .",
    "thus , the past history in the case of the hard - to - soft transitions appears to be not just existence a hot flow but also the state of the surrounding cold disc .",
    "a way of testing the above hypothesis would be studying the evolution of the solid angle covered by the disc by measuring the strength of compton reflection in the source .",
    "indeed , an increasing strength of reflection with decreasing @xmath124 is expected from consideration of energy balance ( zdziarski , lubiski & smith 1999 ) , and consistent with the observed associated increase of the degree of relativistic broading of fe k spectral features and the qpo frequency ( revnivstev et al .",
    "nowak et al .  ( 2002 ) noted also a correlation of the reflection strength with the x - ray flux before the first soft outburst .",
    "we would then expect different time histories of compton reflection and the flux in the case of the hard state preceding the first and the second of the soft outbursts .",
    "we have found several interesting aspects of the variability of gx  3394  during the hard state .",
    "first of all , the strongest correlation in the _",
    "rxte_/asm data is a negative one between the 1.55 kev and 312 kev average slopes , forming an upper horizontal branch in the colour - colour diagram , fig .",
    "[ asm_index](e ) .",
    "we find it can be very well explained in the framework of thermal comptonization .",
    "as discussed , e.g. , by z02 , the main factor determining the 312 kev slope is the ratio between the power in soft photons incident on the comptonizing plasma to the power supplied to that plasma , likely determined by a variable source geometry .",
    "a hardening of that slope corresponds to a reduction of that ratio .",
    "however , only a geometry - dependent fraction of the emitted soft flux is incident on the hot flow .",
    "the main variability pattern may consist of changing this fraction rather than the total soft flux .",
    "then , a reduction of the incident fraction would both harden the comptonized spectrum and decrease the point at which that spectrum intersects with the spectrum of the soft photons , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ patterns](a ) .",
    "the change may be caused by a variable overlap of the cold disc by the hot flow ( see fig .  15 in z02 ) .    in order to model this effect quantitatively ,",
    "we have used a comptonization model of coppi ( 1999 ) ( described in detail in gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ) , in which the plasma electron temperature is determined self - consistently from energy balance between the powers in the hot plasma and the incident seed photons",
    ". the x - ray slope is determined by @xmath188 and the thomson optical depth , @xmath189 .",
    "we have assumed that there is a constant total power in the soft blackbody spectrum , but its fraction irradiating the hot plasma is variable , as discussed above .",
    "we assumed the soft photon spectrum is a disc blackbody with the maximum temperature of @xmath190 kev ( corongiu et al .",
    "2003 ) , and @xmath191 ( w02 ) .    at one extremum , all the blackbody photons irradiate the plasma ( i.e.",
    ", the cold disc is embedded in the hot flow ) , which power is assumed to be 5 times that in the blackbody photons .",
    "this spectrum , absorbed by @xmath140 @xmath60 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ patterns ] by the upper solid curve . based on it",
    ", we calculate the fluxes in the asm energy channels and the effective spectral indices , obtaining @xmath64@xmath192 and @xmath154@xmath193 .",
    "we now reduce the fraction of the blackbody photons incident on the hot plasma by a factor of 10 ( e.g. , due to a radial separation between the cold disc and hot flow ) .",
    "this strongly reduces the cooling rate , leading to both a spectral hardening of the power - law emission ( dotted curve ) and the appearance of the unscattered part of the blackbody ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the resulting total spectrum ( the lower solid curve in fig .   [ patterns ] ) has @xmath64@xmath194 and @xmath154@xmath195 .",
    "the two points corresponding to those spectral solutions are joint by a heavy black line in fig .",
    "[ asm_index](e ) .",
    "we see this effect leads to a correlation with a slope identical to the best fit to the data .",
    "second , we have found the high - energy spectrum softens with the increasing luminosity . in the thermal comptonization model , which fits broad - band data for gx",
    "3394  well ( z98 , w02 ) , the energy of the cutoff is directly related to @xmath188 . as in w02 , we consider a hot accretion model of zdziarski ( 1998 ) , parametrized by the compton parameter , @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the electron rest energy .",
    "this parameter determines the slope , @xmath58 , which is weakly dependent on the flux in the data , see fig .",
    "[ asm_index](c ) , indicating a constant @xmath198 .",
    "then , @xmath199 and @xmath200 ( where @xmath170 is the luminosity ) in the advection and cooling dominated cases , respectively ( zdziarski 1998 ) .",
    "this behaviour reflects more efficient cooling at higher accretion rates .    in order to test those predictions ,",
    "we first fit a spectrum from a pointed observation ( the _ ginga_/osse spectrum no .  1 of z98 ) by a model including the intrinsic continuum due to thermal comptonization .",
    "we now use a comptonization model of poutanen & svensson ( 1996 ) , also used by w02 , in which , in contrast to the model of coppi ( 1999 ) , @xmath188 is a free parameter .",
    "the resulting points are plotted by the rightmost asterisk in each of figs .",
    "[ asm_index](c ) and [ batse_index](a  d ) .",
    "we then reduce the luminosity by a factor of 5 and increase @xmath188 according to the above two dependences .",
    "we also consider the case with @xmath170 recuced by a factor of 10 , and @xmath199 .",
    "the resulting three model points are shown by the three left - hand - side asterisks in each of figs .",
    "[ asm_index](c ) , [ batse_index](a  d ) .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ asm_index](c ) that the three points correspond indeed to almost the same x - ray slope as the original data .",
    "we also see that this model roughly reproduces the index increasing with the flux above 40 kev , figs .",
    "[ batse_index](b  c ) .",
    "it predicts an almost constant @xmath58 in the 2070 kev range , not reproducing a slight increasing trend in the data , fig .",
    "[ batse_index](a ) .",
    "however , this increase of @xmath58 is solely due to the batse data preceding the _ rxte_/asm monitoring , for which we do not know the behaviour in the 312 kev range .",
    "thus , this model provides a likely explanation of the behaviour seen in the hard - state batse data .",
    "third , we have found a pivot point around @xmath1200 kev , figs .",
    "[ batse_index](c  d ) , which is similar to the variability pattern found in a number of seyfert galaxies ( zdziarski et al .",
    "this implies that though a major driver of the variability is at low energies due to the variable flux of seed photons for thermal comtonization , an increase / decrease of that flux is accompanied by a similar increase / decrease of the power in the hot comptonizing plasma .",
    "[ patterns](b ) illustrates such a pattern , resulting in a pivot at 200 kev .",
    "we used the same models as those of fig .",
    "14a of z02 , but adjusted their normalization as above .",
    "in that model , @xmath188 is self - consistently adjusted to varying irradiation by soft photons .    both above patterns ,",
    "the decreasing @xmath201 , modelled for a constant x - ray slope , and pivoting , which changes the slope , act together .",
    "the pivoting may explain the softening of the 2070 kev slope with the increasing flux , not explained by the @xmath201 dependence .",
    "it also explains the disagreement of the trend predicted by the @xmath201 model at energies above 160 kev , see the asterisks in fig .",
    "[ batse_index](d ) , where pivoting dominates .",
    "in fact , the variability pattern shown in fig .  [ patterns](b ) includes softening of the spectrum with increasing luminosity , as the increase is accompanied by a decreasing @xmath188 ( see above and z02 ) .",
    "altogether , thermal componization explains well both the long - term spectral variability of gx  3394  in its hard state and its broad - band x@xmath5-ray spectra ( z98 , w02 ) . on the other hand , synchrotron emission by nonthermal power law electrons in a jet",
    "was proposed to be responsible for its hard - state x@xmath5-ray spectra ( markoff et al .",
    "this model is motivated by the presence of very good correlations between the radio and x - ray fluxes in a few bands above 3 kev found in gx  3394  ( corbel et al .",
    "however , the nonthermal synchrotron model for the x@xmath5-ray spectra suffers from many problems ( e.g. , zdziarski et al .",
    "2003 ) , in particular it requires the high - energy cutoff in the electron distribution to be both very sharp and highly fine - tuned .",
    "our present results on spectral correlation add to the problems of this model .",
    "especially , we have shown that the hard x - ray power law responds to the variability in the soft x - ray excess , with an increase of the relative strength of the excess associated with a hardening of the power law . in the nonthermal model , the power law extends down to the turnover frequency in the infrared , and it is not clear which mechanism would cause such behaviour ( explained by thermal comptonization cooling in our model ) .",
    "it is also unclear why the nonthermal power law should pivot around 200 kev .    as discussed in zdziarski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the likely origin of the radio - x - ray flux correlation is the formation of the radio jet out from energetic particles in the hot inner flow ( i.e. , the base of the jet being that flow ) , which also radiates x - rays .",
    "in particular , heinz & sunyaev ( 2003 ) derived power law dependences between the jet radio flux and @xmath119 . on the other hand",
    ", the accretion luminosity also follows a power law dependence on @xmath119 , with the exponent @xmath2021 ( e.g. , shapiro et al .",
    "1976 ; narayan & yi 1996 ; zdziarski 1998 ) .",
    "consequently , there will be a power law dependence between the jet radio flux and the bolometric accretion luminosity .",
    "in order to test this theoretical prediction , we plot in fig .",
    "[ xte_radio ] the dependence between the 8.6 ghz radio flux of corbel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and the bolometric flux estimated by us from the pca / hexte data .",
    "we have used only the radio measurements for which same - day x - ray measurements exist . with the current calibration of the pca ( see section [ data ] ) , we also obtain an x - ray detection on mjd 51388 ( with the 316 kev flux of @xmath203 erg @xmath60 s@xmath39 ) , for which corbel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reported an upper limit .",
    "we obtain indeed an excellent correlation for all the points with the radio measurements . a least - square fit symmetric in both fluxes yields @xmath204 where we have included systematic errors with a fractional value ( of 0.25 ) as implied by the condition of @xmath205 , and the units are as in fig .",
    "[ xte_radio ] .",
    "observationally , this systematic error is mostly due to systematic errors of calculating the bolometric @xmath170 ( see section [ data ] ) , and the observations being not fully simultaneous .",
    "interestingly , we see that the correlation breaks down at lowest fluxes as implied by the radio upper limit ( which was not included in the fit ) .",
    "we note that our explanation of the correlation of corbel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is different from that of markoff et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who attributed it to the x - ray flux and the optically - thin jet emission being the same power law of the nonthermal synchrotron . in our explanation",
    ", we do not require the jet optically - thin emission and the x - rays to lie on the same power law .",
    "we have found that the current optical / ir data imply that the distance to gx  3394  is @xmath0 kpc .",
    "its most likely location is in the galactic bulge .",
    "we also argue against the recently proposed distance of @xmath115 kpc , in which case gx  3394  would be a halo object .",
    "then , we have performed a comprehensive analysis of 16 years of the long - term variability of gx  3394 .",
    "we found the long - term @xmath183 from this transient source has increased about threefold since 1991 , corresponding to marked changes in the character of the outbursts .",
    "the epoch mjd 4840049500 was characterized by a @xmath1500 d cycle of strong hard outbursts separated by deep quiescence and @xmath206 .",
    "the epoch mjd 4950050800 was characterized by a persistent hard state and @xmath183 about 1.5 times the above value .",
    "this increase lead then to a long soft state , a @xmath11000 d queiescence , and the most recent @xmath1400 d very strong outburst . during this epoch ,",
    "mjd 5080053000 , @xmath207 .",
    "we have studied in detail hysteresis in this source .",
    "especially interesting is the strong dependence of the flux of the hard - to - soft transition on the preceding behaviour of the hard / off state .",
    "the 1998 transition , which followed the long persistent hard - state period , took place at the flux about three times lower than the 2002 one , which followed the long queiescent epoch .",
    "we model the hysteretic variations by independent variability of the accretion rate and the inner radius of the cold disc .",
    "the maximum possible @xmath119 in the hard state is higher than the minimum possible one in the soft state , but transitions from the hard to soft state can occur below that maximum .",
    "we have found a new x - ray spectral correlation in gx  3394 , between the relative strength of the soft excess ( due to blackbody disc emision ) in the hard state and the hardness of the main power law component .",
    "the effect is explained by cooling of the hot comptonizing plasma by a variable fraction of the disc emission , probably related to a variable overlap of the disc by the hot flow .",
    "interestingly , the correlation forms an upper horizontal branch in the colour - colour diagram , previously thought to be specific to neutron - star binaries .",
    "in contrast to cyg x-1 , we do not find any orbital modulation of the x - ray flux .",
    "we have also found a pivoting pattern of hard - state x - ray variability , with the pivot energy at @xmath1200 kev , and confirmed the existence of an anticorrelation between the bolometric flux and the high - energy cutoff , presumably related to the temperature of the comptonizing electrons .",
    "the weak correlation of the x - ray slope and the flux ( in contrast to the case in cyg x-1 ) is explained by the wide range of the fluxes at which the the hard state appears , related to the transient nature of gx  3394 .",
    "our results provide strong support to the thermal - comptonization nature of x - rays in the hard state .",
    "we explain that the correlation between the x - ray and radio fluxes by the total power of the accretion emission being correlated with the power in outflowing particles forming the radio jet , which is , in turn , correlated with the radio flux .",
