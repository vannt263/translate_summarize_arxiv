    "theoretical models of supermassive black hole formation ( e.g. , haehnelt , natarajan , & rees 1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 , 2002 ) have historically relied on comparisons with the optical quasar luminosity function , so these models now need to be reworked .",
    "in addition , the hard x - ray luminosity functions have revealed that broad - line agns dominate the number densities at the higher x - ray luminosities , while non  broad - line agns dominate at the lower x - ray luminosities ( steffen et al .",

    "one possibility is that the simple unified model for agns , where the differences between broad - line agns and non  broad - line agns are only due to orientation effects , needs to be modified to include an x - ray luminosity dependent covering factor .",
    "the second , more speculative possibility is that the steffen effect is a consequence of the broad - line agns being intrinsically different than the non  broad - line agns .",
    "we are now in a position to do a very thorough study of the nature and evolution of hard x - ray  selected agns .",
    "the primary aims of this paper are to explore the origin of the steffen effect and to determine the bolometric luminosities of all agns in order to understand the energy release history of supermassive black hole accretion .",

    "the most optically - luminous host galaxies would not just cease to exist as x - ray sources .",
    "thus , figure  [ galevol ] suggests that the loss of the highest @xmath43 sources is indeed an agn downsizing effect .",
    "the highest mass supermassive black holes in the most optically - luminous host galaxies are switching off between @xmath13 and the present time , leaving only the lower mass supermassive black holes in the less optically - luminous galaxies active .",

    "one possible way to account for at least part of the steffen effect , i.e. , the absence of broad - line agns at low x - ray luminosities , would be if the nuclear optical light of the optically - narrow agns were being swamped by the host galaxy light , thereby washing out the broad - line signal ( moran , filippenko , & chornock 2002 ; moran 2004 ) . in the present spectroscopic obsertvations ,",
    "this effect would be less pronounced at lower redshifts , where the nuclear light is a larger part of the light entering the spectrograph slit than the extended galaxy . in this section ,",
    "we explore the possibility of galaxy dilution by looking at the nuclear uv / optical properties of the _ chandra _ x - ray sources and determining how these properties relate to the spectral characteristics of the sources .",
    "if the dilution hypothesis is correct , then we would expect the optically - narrow agns to have the same optical to x - ray ratios as the broad - line agns when we isolate their nuclear uv / optical light .    in  [ secnuc ]",
    ", we found that the nuclear dominated sources are mostly observed as broad - line agns , while the galaxy dominated sources are not . at first glance , this result could be seen as consistent with the dilution hypothesis .",
    "however , if we look more closely at the nuclear uv / optical magnitudes of the sources and compare them with the x - ray fluxes , a different picture emerges .",
    "it is well known ( e.g. , zamorani et al .  1981 ) that there is a strong correlation between the nuclear uv magnitudes and the x - ray fluxes for broad - line agns .",
    "we can see this correlation for the broad - line agns in our sample in figure  [ figfs_nuc ] .",
    "however , the correlation does not continue to hold for the narrow - line agns .",
    "in fact , from figure  [ figfs_nuc ] , we see that the nuclei of the narrow - line agns are much weaker relative to their x - ray light than would be expected if they were similar to the broad - line agns .    in figure  [ nuc_flux_z1 ]",
    ", we plot nuclear rest - frame 3000    flux versus rest - frame @xmath10  kev flux .",
    "we restrict to the redshift range @xmath168 , where the deconvolution procedure should be similar for all of the sources to provide a highly uniform sample , but the result holds at all redshifts . in general , the optically - narrow agns fall well below the relation for the broad - line agns , with the high - excitation sources lying closer to the relation , and the absorbers and star formers lying well below the relation , on average .    from the above results ,",
    "we are led to conclude that the absence of broad - line agns at low x - ray luminosities is not a dilution effect , but rather that the optically - narrow agns really have weaker uv / optical nuclei relative to the x - rays .",
    "this leaves open the question of whether the lower uv / optical fluxes are a consequence of obscuration ( as would be suggested by figure  [ figcol ] and by the observational evidence supporting the unified model ; e.g. , antonucci 1993 ) or a result of intrinsic differences in the source populations ( e.g. , the optically - narrow agns intrinsically have less uv emission and no broad - line region or perhaps are at a different stage in their evolutionary sequence ) . at least having ruled out dilution as a partial explanation for the steffen effect , we can state firmly that the simple unified model has failed because of the existence of the steffen effect .",
    "probably the simplest interpretation of the steffen effect is that the covering fraction of obscuration in the agns is extremely small at high x - ray luminosities ( so all we see at these high luminosities are broad - line agns ) and extremely large ( near unity ) at low x - ray luminosities ( so we do not see broad - line agns at these low luminosities ) .",
    "we shall hereafter refer to this as the luminosity dependent unified model .",
    "if the luminosity depedent unified model is the correct explanation of the steffen effect , then there are important implications for the interpretation of the spectral energy distributions of the x - ray sources ( see  [ sechxlum ] ) .",
    "in any unified scheme , where the absorption is due to the orientation of the agn relative to the line of sight , any fir emission powered by the nucleus or by star formation will be emitted isotropically ; thus , the fir / submillimeter properties of the absorbed sources should be the same as those of the unabsorbed sources .",

    "whether one uses the recent optical qso luminosity function determinations of croom et al .",
    "( 2004 ) or our broad - line agn hard x - ray luminosity function determinations , assuming @xmath8 , both give about half the accreted supermassive black hole mass density found by yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) .",
    "this means that there is still room for obscured accretion from the optically - narrow agns when we compare with the local supermassive black hole mass density .",
    "in fact , for @xmath9 , we find reasonable agreement between our accreted supermassive black hole mass density for all spectral types ( equation  [ eqall1 ] or [ eqall2 ] ) and the local supermassive black hole mass density determined by yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) : @xmath271 however , we note that there is very little room for further obscured sources or for any low efficiency accretion periods .",
    "in this paper , we presented a thorough analysis of the nature and evolution of hard x - ray  selected agns using both deep and wide - area _ chandra _",
    "surveys with nearly complete optical spectroscopic follow - up observations .",
    "our results are as follows .",
    "@xmath272 we determined median redshifts and @xmath64 median redshift ranges with x - ray flux for the spectroscopically and spectroscopically plus photometrically identified x - ray samples .",
    "we found that the median redshifts are fairly constant with x - ray flux at @xmath0 and that the lower x - ray flux sources , where the surveys are more spectroscopically incomplete , are dominated by sources with hard x - ray luminosities below @xmath273  ergs  s@xmath2 and redshifts near one .",
    "@xmath272 we spectrally classified the optical counterparts to the x - ray sources and measured the fwhm line widths of the spectra .",
    "we found that the x - ray  selected broad - line agns recover essentially all of the optically - selected type 1 agns and that the only distinction that can be made from the x - ray colors is between the broad - line agns and the sources that do not show broad lines ( @xmath1  km  s@xmath2 ; the `` optically - narrow '' agns ) .",
    "most of the broad - line agns show essentially no visible absorption in x - rays , while the optically - narrow agns show a wide range of absorbing column densities .",
    "however , these absorbing column densities show little dependence on the optical spectral type or on the line widths of the optically - narrow agns .",
    "@xmath272 we constructed up - to - date low and high - redshift hard x - ray luminosity functions for all spectral types and for broad - line agns alone using our highly spectroscopically complete observed samples .",
    "we did maximum likelihood fits over the redshift range @xmath12 .",
    "we found that all of the hard x - ray luminosity functions are consistent with pure luminosity evolution , with @xmath274 for all spectral types and @xmath275 for broad - line agns .",
    "thus , all agns drop in luminosity by almost an order of magnitude over this redshift range .",
    "@xmath272 we directly compared our broad - line agn hard x - ray luminosity functions with the optical qso luminosity functions and found that at the bright end , the luminosity functions agreed extremely well at all redshifts .",
    "however , we found that the optical qso luminosity functions do not probe faint enough to see the downturn in the broad - line agn hard x - ray luminosity functions and that they may even be missing some sources at the very lowest luminosities to which they probe .",
    "@xmath272 we determined the evolution with redshift of the hard x - ray energy density production rate and found that at @xmath139 , it bears a striking resemblance to the overall redshift evolution of the star formation rate density .",
    "we also determined the evolution according to spectral type , applying incompleteness corrections to the production rates of the optically - narrow agns .",
    "we found that at @xmath150 , most of the hard x - ray energy density production is due to optically - narrow agns , while at higher redshifts , the broad - line agns dominate the production .",
    "@xmath272 we estimated black hole masses for the broad - line agns using our measured mgii 2800    line widths and nuclear optical luminosities of sources in the _ hst _ acs goods - north region of the cdf - n . for the resulting small sample , we found a surprisingly tight correlation between hard x - ray luminosity and black hole mass at @xmath13 , with the black holes accreting at a fairly constant rate of 16% of the eddington luminosity .",
    "@xmath272 from the x - ray sources in the acs goods - north region of the cdf - n , we found that the most luminous x - ray sources lie in the most optically - luminous host galaxies , as would be expected from the bulge luminosity  black hole mass relation .",
    "we also found that the host galaxy optical luminosities do not change much with redshift for a given interval in hard x - ray luminosity , but the most optically - luminous host galaxies that existed at high redshifts have completely disappered at low redshifts .",
    "we therefore concluded that the observed drop in the hard x - ray luminosities is due to agn downsizing rather than to an evolution in the accretion rates onto the supermassive black holes .",
    "that is , the highest mass supermassive black holes in the most optically - luminous host galaxies are switching off between @xmath13 and the present time , leaving only the lower mass supermassive black holes in the less optically - luminous galaxies active .",
    "@xmath272 a primary aim of the paper was to explore the origin of the steffen effect , which is the observation that broad - line agns dominate the number densities at the higher x - ray luminosities , while non  broad - line agns dominate at the lower x - ray luminosities .",
    "we ruled out galaxy dilution as being a partial explanation of the steffen effect by seeing how the nuclear uv / optical properties of the x - ray sources in the cdf - n ( measured from the acs goods - north data ) relate to the spectral characteristics of the sources .",
    "we found that the uv / optical nuclei of the optically - narrow agns are much weaker than expected if the optically - narrow agns were similar to the broad - line agns .",
    "since the simple unified model can not explain the steffen effect , we postulated that the simplest interpretation of the steffen effect is a luminosity dependent unified model .",
    "another possible interpretation is that the broad - line agns and the optically - narrow agns are intrinsically different . regardless of which interpretation is correct , a large fraction of the low - redshift , hard x - ray energy density production is in optically - narrow agns ; thus , bolometric corrections for these sources are needed if we are to map the accretion history with redshift .",
    "@xmath272 to infer the bolometric corrections , we constructed composite spectral energy distributions ( including long - wavelength data from the mid - infrared to the submillimeter ) as a function of both spectral type and x - ray luminosity ( to cover both interpretations of the steffen effect ) .",
    "in contrast to the broad - line agns , we found that the optically - narrow agns are , on average , highly suppressed in the frequency range between the uv and soft x - rays and have a strong far - infrared component .",
    "we inferred a bolometric correction of about 85 for these sources .",
    "likewise , we found that the low x - ray luminosity sources have much fainter uv / optical nuclei relative to their @xmath10  kev fluxes than do high x - ray luminosity sources .",
    "the far - infrared luminosities of these low x - ray luminosity sources are also consistent with a bolometric correction of 85 .",
    "@xmath272 using our bolometric corrections and our parameterizations of the evolution of the rest - frame hard x - ray energy density production rates , we inferred the accreted supermassive black hole mass densities for all spectral types and for broad - line agns alone .",
    "we found that only about one - half to one - quarter of the supermassive black hole mass density was fabricated in broad - line agns .",
    "@xmath272 we compared our accreted supermassive black hole mass density for broad - line agns alone with the optical qso determination made by yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) using the boyle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) qso luminosity function , assuming @xmath8 .",
    "our value is 1.75 times smaller than their value , but this difference is very sensitive to their extrapolation of the optical qso luminosity function outside the optically observed luminosity range .",
    "the new croom et al .",
    "( 2004 ) qso luminosity function has a shallower faint - end slope than boyle et al .",
    "we recalculated the accreted supermassive black hole mass densities for optical qsos using the croom et al .",
    "fit , first by restricting to the measured absolute magnitude range , and second by extrapolating the fit to higher and lower luminosities , and we found that the two values bracketed our hard x - ray luminosity function determination .",
    "thus , both the new optical qso luminosity function and the hard x - ray luminosity function determinations of the supermassive black hole mass densities are a factor of almost two lower than the yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) determination .",
    "this leaves room for obscured accretion by the optically - narrow agns in a comparison with the local supermassive black hole mass density .",
    "@xmath272 for @xmath9 , we found reasonable agreement between our hard x - ray luminosity function supermassive black hole mass density for all spectral types and the local supermassive black hole mass density ; however , there is little room for further obscured sources or for any low efficiency accretion periods .",
