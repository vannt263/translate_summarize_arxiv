    "rare @xmath1 meson decays , induced by the flavor  changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath2 transitions is one of the most promising research area in particle physics .",
    "theoretical interest to the rare @xmath1 decays lies in their role as a potential precision testing ground for the standard model ( sm ) at loop level .",
    "experimentally , these decays will provide a more precise determination of the elements of the cabibbo  kobayashi  maskawa matrix ( ckm ) , such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 and @xmath5 violation .",
    "the impressive experimental search for the study of the @xmath1 meson decay will be carried out in future , when new experimental facilities , especially the @xmath1factories at belle @xcite and babar @xcite , are upgraded , and after which the large number @xmath6@xmath7 of b hadrons that is expected to be produced in these factories , will allow measuring the fcnc decays of b mesons .    in the first hand",
    ", the most reliable quantitative test of fcnc in @xmath1 meson decays is expected to be measured in the @xmath8 decay .",
    "the matrix elements of the @xmath9 transition contains terms describing the virtual effects by @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 loops which are proportional to combination of the ckm elements @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively . using the unitarity condition of the ckm matrix and neglecting @xmath15 in comparison to @xmath16 and @xmath14 , it is obvious that the matrix element for the @xmath9 decay involves only one independent ckm matrix factor , @xmath16 , so that cp  violation in this channel is strongly suppressed in the sm .",
    "the situation is totally different for the @xmath17 decay , since all three ckm factors are of the same order in sm , and therefore can induce considerable cp violation in the decay rate difference of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 processes ( for the current status of @xmath19 decay in sm , see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "so , the @xmath17 is a promising decay for establishing cp violation in b mesons .",
    "the rare b meson decays are also very sensitive to the new physics beyond sm , such as the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) @xcite , etc .",
    "one of the most popular extension of the sm is the 2hdm @xcite , which contains two complex higgs doublets rather than one , as is the case in the sm . in the 2hdm , the fcnc that appear at the tree level ,",
    "are avoided by imposing an _ ad hoc _ discrete symmetry @xcite .",
    "one possible way to avoid these unwanted fcnc at tree level , is to couple all fermions to only one of the two higgs doublets ( model i ) .",
    "the other possibility is the coupling of the up and down quarks to the first and second doublets , respectively ( model ii ) .",
    "models i and ii have been extensively investigated theoretically and tested experimentally ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the 2hdm without the _ ad hoc _ discrete symmetry was analyzed in @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is clear that the tree level fcnc appears in this model , however their couplings involving first and second generations must be strongly suppressed .",
    "this conclusion is the result of the analysis of low energy experiments .",
    "therefore , model iii should be parametrized in a way that suppresses the tree level fcnc couplings of the first generation , while the tree level fcnc couplings involving the third generation can be made non  zero as long as they do not violate the existing experimental data ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath1@xmath20 mixing .    in this work , following @xcite , we assume that all tree level fcnc couplings are negligible .",
    "however , even under this assumption , the couplings of fermions with higgs bosons may have a complex phase @xmath21 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the constraints on the phase angle @xmath22 in the product @xmath23 ( see below ) of higgs  fermion couplings imposed by the neutron electric dipole moment , @xmath1@xmath20 mixing , @xmath24 parameter and @xmath25 decay are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is the quantitative investigation of the cp violation in the inclusive @xmath0 decay in context of the general 2hdm , in which a new phase parameter is present ( see below ) . in other words ,",
    "this model contains a new source of cp violation whose interference with the sm phase can induce considerable difference in the cp violation predicted by the sm . to find an answer to the question of , `` to what extend the new physics effects the results of the sm '' , is the main goal of the present work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we present the necessary theoretical background for the general 2hdm and calculate the branching ratio , cp violation and forward  backward asymmetry in the @xmath17 decay . finally , sect .",
    "3 is devoted to the numerical analysis and concluding remarks .",
    "before presenting the necessary theoretical expressions for studying @xmath17 decay , let us briefly remind the main essential points of the model iii . in this model , without loss of generality , we can choose a basis such that the first higgs doublet creates all fermion and gauge boson masses , whose vacuum expectation values are h_1 = (    c 0 +   +    )  ,   h_2 = 0  . in this basis",
    "the first doublet @xmath26 is the same as in the sm , and all new higgs bosons result from the second doublet @xmath27 , which can be written as h_1 = (    c g^+ +   + v + _ 1 ^ 0 + i g^0    )  ,  h_2 = (    c h^+ +   + _ 2 ^ 0",
    "+ i a^0    )  , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the goldstone bosons .",
    "the neutral @xmath30 and @xmath31 are not the physical basis , but their linear combination gives the physical neutral @xmath32 and @xmath33 higgs bosons : _",
    "1 ^ 0 = h^0 - h^0  , + _ 2 ^ 0 = h^0 + h^0  .",
    "the general yukawa lagrangian can be written as _",
    "ij^u |q_il h_1 u_jr + _ ij^d |q_il h_1 d_jr + _",
    "ij^u |q_il h_2 u_jr + _ ij^d |q_il h_2 d_jr + h.c .  , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the generation indices , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , in general , are the non  diagonal coupling matrices , @xmath39 is the left  handed fermion doublet , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the right  handed singlets . in eq . ( 1 ) all states are weak states , that can be transformed to the mass eigenstates by rotation . after this rotation is performed , the yukawa lagrangian takes the following form ( only the part of the yukawa lagrangian that is relevant to our analysis ) _ y = - h^+ |u  .",
    "the fcnc couplings are contained in the matrices @xmath42 . in the present analysis",
    ", we will use a simple ansatz for @xmath42 @xcite , ^u , d = _ ij  , this ansatz guarantees that fcnc for the first generations are strongly suppressed since it is proportional to the small quark mass .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( 3 ) that , we can safely neglect the neutral higgs boson exchange diagrams , and only charged higgs boson gives new contribution to the @xmath17 decay . note that @xmath43 are complex parameters of order @xmath44 ( see @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath45 . being complex , @xmath43 allow the charged higgs boson to interfere destructively or constructively to the sm results .",
    "in other words , branching ratio , as well as cp asymmetry , can get increased or decreased for the @xmath17 decay in model iii . for simplicity",
    "we choose @xmath46 to be diagonal to suppress all tree level fcnc couplings , and as a result @xmath43 are also diagonal but remain complex .",
    "note that the results for model i and model ii can be obtained from model iii by the following substitutions : & & _ tt =   _ bb = -  , + & & _ tt =   _ bb = +  .",
    "after these preliminary remarks , let us return our attention to the @xmath47 decay .",
    "the powerful framework into which the perturbative qcd corrections to the physical decay amplitude incorporated in a systematic way , is the effective hamiltonian method . in this approach , the heavy degrees of freedom in the present case , i.e. , @xmath48 quark , @xmath49 are all integrated out .",
    "the procedure is to match the full theory with the effective theory at high scale @xmath50 , and then calculate the wilson coefficients at lower @xmath51 using the renormalization group equations . in our calculations",
    "we choose the higher scale as @xmath50 , since in the version of the 2hdm we consider in this work , the charged higgs boson the charged higgs boson is heavy enough ( @xmath52 see @xcite ) to neglect the evolution from @xmath53 to @xmath54 . in the version of the 2hdm we consider in this work , the charged higgs boson exchange diagrams",
    "do not produce new operators and the operator set is the same as the one used for the @xmath17 decay in the sm , but the values of the wilson coefficients are changed at @xmath54 scale .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath17 decay is the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath17 decay is @xcite = -4 v_tb v^*_td \\{_i=0 ^ 10 c_i ( ) o_i ( ) + _ u _",
    "i=1 ^ 2 c_i ( ) }  , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the wilson coefficients .",
    "the explicit form of all operators @xmath57 can be found in @xcite . using the effective hamiltonian ,",
    "the matrix element of the @xmath17 decay takes the following form : & = & v_td v^*_tb \\ { c_9^eff |d _",
    "( 1- _ 5 ) b |^+ c_10 |d _ ( 1- _ 5 ) b",

    "p^(1+_5 ) b |^ }  , where @xmath58 is the invariant dilepton mass squared , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the four  momentum of leptons . in eq . ( 5 ) all wilson coefficients are evaluated at the @xmath61 scale .",
    "as has already been noted earlier , in the model under consideration the charged higgs boson contributions to leading order at @xmath50 scale modify only values of the wilson coefficients , i.e. , c_7 ^ 2hdm(m_w ) & = & c_7^sm(m_w ) + c_7^h^(m_w ) + c_9 ^ 2hdm(m_w ) & = & c_9^sm(m_w ) + c_9^h^(m_w ) + c_10 ^ 2hdm(m_w ) & = & c_10^sm(m_w ) + c_10^h^(m_w )  .",
    "the coefficients @xmath62 to the leading order are given by c_7 ^ 2hdm(m_w ) & = & x + x + & + & _ tt ^2 ( + y ) + & + & _ tt _ bb ( + y )  , +   +   + c_9 ^ 2hdm(m_w ) & = & - b(m_w ) + c(m_w ) + & - & - x + + & + & _ tt ^2  , +   +   + c_10 ^ 2hdm(m_w ) & = & ( b(m_w ) - c(m_w ) ) + & + & _ tt ^2 ( - + y )  , where b(x ) & = & - + x  , + c(x ) & = & ( + x )  , + x & = &   y =  , and @xmath63 is the weinberg angle . the coefficient @xmath64 at the scale @xmath65 in next to leading order , taking into account the charged higgs boson contributions , is calculated in @xcite : c_7^eff(m_b ) = c_7 ^ 0(m_b ) + c_7 ^ 1,eff(m_b )  , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the leading and next to leading order contributions , whose explicit forms can be found in @xcite . in our case",
    ", the expressions for these coefficients can be obtained from the results of @xcite by making the following replacements : y ^2 _ tt ^2    x y^ * _ tt _ bb e^i  . in the sm ,",
    "the qcd corrected wilson coefficient @xmath68 , which enters to the decay amplitude up to the next leading order has been calculated in @xcite . in order to calculate @xmath69 at @xmath70 scale ,",
    "it is enough to replace @xmath71 by @xmath69 in @xcite .",
    "hence , including the next to leading order qcd corrections , @xmath68 can be written as : + & & + _ u - g(0,s ) + & & - g ( 1 , s ) - g ( 0 , s ) + & & +  , where @xmath72 , @xmath73 and + & & - 1 -s - s+   represents the @xmath74 correction from the one gluon exchange in the matrix element of @xmath75 , while the function @xmath76 arises from one loop contributions of the four  quark operators @xmath77@xmath78 , whose form is + & & + \\ { 1 - y_i ( - i ) + y_i -1 2 }  , where @xmath79 . the wilson coefficient @xmath80 does not receive any new contribution in evolution from @xmath81 to @xmath70 scale , i.e. , @xmath82 . the wilson coefficients @xmath83 receives also long distance contributions , which have their origin in the real @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 intermediate states , i.e. , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 family .",
    "these contributions must be added to the complete perturbative results . in the current literature , there exist four different approaches in taking into account @xmath11 resonance contributions : a ) hqet based approach @xcite , b ) the amm approach @xcite , c ) the lsw approach @xcite , and d ) ks approach @xcite . in the present article",
    ", we choose the amm approach , in which these resonance contributions are parametrized using a breit  wigner shape with the normalization fixed by data .",
    "the effective coefficient @xmath83 including the @xmath90 and @xmath89 resonances are defined as c_9^eff c_9 ( ) + y_res ( s )  , where @xmath91 in ndr scheme is given by y_res & = & - \\ { ( c^(0 ) ( ) + _ u ) _ v_i= + & - &",
    "_ u g(m_u , s ) _ v_i= , }  .",
    "moreover , the experimental data determines only the product @xmath92 @xcite , which is kept fixed .    using eq .",
    "( 5 ) , the double differential decay rate can be calculated straightforwardly .",
    "neglecting the lepton masses and performing summation over final leptons and @xmath93 quark polarizations , the double differential branching ratio takes the following form ( the masses of the leptons and @xmath93 quark are all neglected ) : & = & b_0 \\ { 4 a_1(s , z ) c_7^eff ^2 + a_2(s , z ) + & + & a_3(s , z ) + & - & 4 a_4(s , z ) + & -&4 a_5(s , z ) }  , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and a_1(s , z ) & = & ( s -1 ) ^2  , + a_2(s , z ) & = & - ( s -1 ) ^2  , + a_3(s , z ) & = & 2 ( s -1 ) ^2 s z  , + a_4 ( s , z ) & = & 2 ( s -1 ) ^2  , + a_5(s , z ) & = & - 2 ( s -1 ) ^2 z  . in deriving the above expression",
    ", we have normalized the branching ratio to the branching ratio of the semileptonic @xmath96 decay which has been measured experimentally , in order to be free of the uncertainties coming from @xmath97 quark mass .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath98 is given as b_0 = b_sl  , and the phase factor @xmath99 , and the @xmath100 qcd corrected factor @xcite @xmath101 of the @xmath96 decay are given by , f(m_c ) & = & 1 - 8 m_c^2 + 8 m_c^6 - m_c^8 - 24 m_c^4 m_c  , +   + ( m_c ) & = & 1 -  .",
    "after integrating over @xmath102 in eq .",

    "however their branching ratios are relatively small , and hence are neglected .",
    "performing integration over @xmath103 in the above  mentioned region , we obtain the partly integrated branching ratio = _ 1/m_b^2 ^ 6/m_b^2 d s  , together with @xmath105 for the cp  conjugate decays @xmath18 , and the branching ratio averaged over the charge  conjugated states = +    @xmath18 and @xmath17 decays is defined as a_cp =  . representing @xmath106 and @xmath107 as c_7^eff & = & _ 1 + i _ 2  , + c_9^eff & = & _ 1 + _ u _ 2  , and further substituting @xmath108 for the conjugated process @xmath18 , for the cp asymmetry in the partial rate we get , a_cp & = & \\ { _ 1/m_b^2 ^ 6/m_b^2 d s \\ { 8 _ u _ 1 _ 2^ + & - & 64 ( s -1 ) ^2 } }  .",
    "we also have studied the integrated forward  backward asymmetry ,",

    "the values of the main input parameters we have used in the numerical analysis are as follows : @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
