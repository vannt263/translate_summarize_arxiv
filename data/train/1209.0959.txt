    "current research on systemic risk can be roughly divided into two different strands each one having its own focus : ( i ) the probability of extreme events which can cause a breakdown of the system , ( ii ) the mechanisms which can amplify the failure of a few system elements , to cause a failure cascade of the size of the system .",
    "the former line of research assumes that systemic risk is caused by _ external _ events ,",
    "e.g. big earthquakes , tsunamis , or meteor impacts .",
    "thus , in addition to the likelihood of extreme events , another interesting question regards the response of the system to such perturbations , i.e. its capability to absorb shocks of a given size .",
    "the latter research area , on the other hand , sees systemic failure as an _ endogenous _ feature that basically emerges from the non - linear interaction of the constituents , i.e. how they redistribute , and possibly amplify , load internally .    in both approaches ,",
    "the likelihood of a systemic breakdown can only be determined by considering the internal dynamics of system elements , denoted as _",
    "agents _ in this paper , such as their capacity to resist shocks , their time - bound interaction with neighbors , their dependence on macroscopic feedback mechanisms , such as coupling to the macroscopic state of the system . only in rare cases",
    "the dynamics of systemic risk can be reduced to mere topological aspects , such as the diversity in the number of neighbors , the role of hubs , _",
    "etc._. in this paper , we combine the two research questions mentioned above : on the one hand , we are interested in the critical size of an external shock that may lead to collapse of the system . at the same time , we address that such critical values depend on the safety margins of the system elements , and the details of their interaction when redistributing load internally .",
    "we also investigate how these _ cascading dynamics _ are affected by the structural features of the network ( level of connectivity , topological heterogeneities)and by individual properties of the agents , such as the probability distributions of the _ failure thresholds_. such insights can directly benefit a robust system design by means of individualization of agents ( i.e. designing agents with optimal heterogeneity ) .    given the importance of such problems for social , economical and technological systems , the topic is already discussed in a wide range of scientific literature .",
    "some modeling framework were recently proposed @xcite .",
    "the _ complex network _",
    "approach was also used to describe cascading processes in power grids and in internet services @xcite , and was also applied to data storage services @xcite .",
    "importantly , similar agent - based approaches were developed to model avalanche defaults among financial institutions @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce the agent - based model studied , determining e.g. agent s _ fragility _ and agents interaction by means of a load redistribution mechanism .",
    "this allows us to define a measure for _ systemic risk _ on the macroscopic level . in section [ sec : risk ]",
    "we develop an analytical framework that allows us to unveil the dynamics of systemic risk based on cascading processes . in section [ sec : het ] , we discuss the critical conditions for systemic risk to emerge . later , in the section [ sec : sysnodes ] , we study when agents can be considered as _ systemic _ by their importance .",
    "the paper finishes with some conclusions in section [ sec : concl ] , which also allow for a generalized picture of how to prevent systemic risk .",
    "[ [ net - fragility ] ] net fragility + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in a recent paper @xcite , a framework to model systemic risk by means of an agent - based approach was developed . in this framework , each agent @xmath6 is characterized by three individual variables : a discrete variable @xmath7 , which describes its state at a discrete time @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 for an operating state and @xmath10 for a failed state , and two continuous variables , the threshold @xmath11 and load @xmath12 .",
    "the threshold is assumed to describe the individual ` _ _ capacity _ _ ' of an agent : it defines how much load an agent can carry before it fails . on the other hand , the variable @xmath13 describes the _ load _ which is exerted on an agent .",
    "we note that while the load can change in time e.g. through systemic feedback , it further depends on the state of other agents @xmath14 and on the network of interactions , described by the adjacency matrix @xmath15 . written this way",
    ", the load also depends on how it is exchanged between agents .",
    "a special case will be discussed below .",
    "we define that agent @xmath6 fails if its _ net fragility _ @xmath16 , @xmath17 is equal or larger than zero .",
    "i.e , in a deterministic model , the dynamics of an agent is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the heaviside function .",
    "certainly , the dynamics only depends on the net fragility , i.e.  on the relative distance between load and threshold .",
    "nevertheless , a distinction between these two individual variables is very useful , as it allows us to conceptually distinguish between internal and external influences on the failure .",
    "[ [ systemic - risk ] ] systemic risk + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we now define the important measure of systemic risk .",
    "we define it as the fraction of failed agents at any point in time . for a system composed of @xmath20 agents",
    ", it reads @xmath21 @xmath22 represents the density of agents with a net fragility @xmath23 at time @xmath8 ; the integral runs over the agents whose net fragility is positive .",
    "failures in a subset of agents will result in cascading processes over the network of interaction , which results in changes of the fragility of other agents in the course of time .",
    "this can be expressed by the recursive dynamics @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is some function that describes how the load of failing agents is redistributed depending on the interaction mechanisms . with this , by specifying the initial condition @xmath26 , it is possible to compute @xmath5 for a deterministic dynamics .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath5 was calculated by making suitable assumptions about the distribution of the net fragility , @xmath27 , the initial conditions @xmath26 , and for the particular case of a fully connected network  i.e.  each agent interacts with everyone else .",
    "specifically , an initial condition @xmath28 , was used ; i.e. the initial fragility of agents is normally distributed with a mean @xmath29 and standard deviation @xmath30 .",
    "this implies that the initial fraction of failed agents at time @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the cumulative function of the normal distribution .",
    "i.e. it gives the ( normalized ) number of agents with an initial net fragility ( defined in eq .  ) ,",
    "equal or larger than zero .",
    "the authors calculated the size of cascades measured by the final fraction of failed agents for different interaction mechanisms .",
    "remarkably , it was found that systemic risk depends on the variance @xmath30 of the distribution @xmath34 in a non - monotonous manner .",
    "this means , systemic risk can decrease if the agents become more heterogeneous , i.e. if their individual threshold becomes more different . on the other hand , for homogeneous agents characterized by the same threshold , a first - order phase transition was found between no systemic risk and complete failure .    [",
    "[ initial - fragility ] ] initial fragility + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we use these previous findings as a reference point , but we will extend our model in different ways .",
    "first of all , instead of a normal distribution for the initial net fragility @xmath35 , we assume a fixed relation between initial fragility @xmath36 and threshold @xmath11 : @xmath37 the parameter @xmath38 is a constant , equal for all agents . only for one agent @xmath39 , instead of the fixed relation ( [ p_c_+uniform ] ) , we define @xmath40 .",
    "thus , we consider that initially only one agent @xmath39 , is at a critical condition , whereas with @xmath41 all other agents are initially capable of handling the load assigned to them . i.e. different from the distribution of initial loads in @xcite , we do not have an initial failure cascade . instead , the initial condition for the systemic risk is simply @xmath42 .",
    "the value @xmath2 can then be regarded as the _ agent available capacity _ ( or safety margin ) before they fail if their load is increased . a fixed relation between fragility and threshold",
    "was first used in @xcite to describe cascading processes in power grids and internet ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it basically reflects the situation of many socio - technical systems in which the capacity of agents is usually _ ad hoc _ designed to handle the load , because limited by cost , under normal conditions .",
    "we will later vary the safety margin @xmath2 to determine how the severity of cascading failures will depend on it .",
    "[ [ threshold - distribution ] ] threshold distribution + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    with these considerations , only the threshold distribution @xmath4 remains to be specified to complete the initial conditions .",
    "it is worth remarking that the capacities of the agents in contrast with other studies found in the literature so far are decoupled from the topological artifacts of the network connecting them . here",
    "we will use three different assumptions for both analytical calculations and computer simulations :    * a delta distribution @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the dirac delta function , i.e. all agents have the same threshold @xmath45 , * a uniform distribution @xmath46 with the mean @xmath29 and the range @xmath30 , i.e. all agents have different , but comparable thresholds in the interval @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "for all further calculations we define @xmath48 . * a power - law distribution @xmath49",
    "i.e. agents have thresholds that can differ by orders of magnitudes .",
    "as the normalization depends on the value @xmath50 , we assign its _ numerical value _ for our further calculations to be comparable with the minimum value of the uniform distribution , @xmath48 .",

    "this can be statistically described by the degree distribution @xmath51 for which we will use in this paper only @xmath52 , i.e. a regular network , in which each agent interacts with @xmath3 other agents .",

    "we regard @xmath208 as a measure of systemic risk .    for both regimes , we are able to derive analytical results to answer these questions .",
    "these results allow us to draw conclusions about the conditions that lead a smaller systemic risk . in the following",
    "we summarize our finding :    \\(1 ) we derive a global stability condition @xmath216 that has to be met in order to allow for finite cascades , in principle .",

    "this allows for an interesting discussion because of the possible trade - off between the two ingredients . in most cases ,",
    "the safety margin is given by the _ technical constitution _ of an agent , e.g. in power grids or routing servers .",
    "@xmath3 , on the other hand , refers to the _ network topology _ but not to internal properties of agents .",
    "hence , systemic risk can be reduced by increasing the network density - at least up to a certain point @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that we have assumed the initial failure of only one agent , here .",
    "if it is , however , more costly to improve the network connectivity than increasing the safety margin of the agents , the latter can serve the same purpose , namely reducing systemic risk .",
    "\\(2 ) in a system of thousands of agents , the network capacity , @xmath88 , which is the total load the system can carry a priori , is also quite big .",
    "one would not easily assume that an initial shock @xmath61 is of the same magnitude as @xmath88 as in the * eee * regime .",
    "hence such big shocks are extreme external events to the system .",
    "the interesting finding in this paper is that even such extreme events may not lead to an `` infinite '' cascade , i.e. to a total collapse of the system .",
    "instead , provided that the global stability condition is met , we find a broad range of system parameters where such cascades stop at finite time , affecting only part of the system .",
    "we have shown that systemic risk resulting from extreme shocks can be reduced ( a ) by a regular lattice structure ( as opposed to e.g. a regular tree structure ) , ( b ) by a broad threshold distribution . in the latter case , we found finite cascades , i.e. @xmath164 , even if the initial shock was _ 2 - 4 times larger _ than the total network capacity , which can be regarded as a sign of real robustness . comparing the power - law threshold distributions of @xmath96 and @xmath219",
    ", we found that , in absolute measures of the shock , the broader distribution lead to the more robust systems . in relative measures , however , this result inverts , simply because a broader distribution also results for a larger network capacity , and hence for larger initial shocks , while the relative measure remains the same .",
    "\\(3 ) investigating the * rie * regime where the initial shock was of the order of the threshold of an average agent , i.e. much smaller than the total network capacity , a systemic failure can occur only if ( a ) the the initial shock is larger or equal to the threshold of the initially failing agent , and ( b ) the redistribution of load is large enough .",
    "hence , dependent on the threshold distribution we can calculate this failure probability .",
    "even in the global stability regime , we find `` infinite '' cascades , but the probability of their occurrence depends on the probability that randomly chosen agent fails initially .",
    "the broader the threshold distribution , the more likely this condition is met , i.e. the frequency of observing `` infinite '' cascades increases with the heterogeneity .",
    "\\(4 ) the initial question : `` how big is too big '' , from this perspective , can be answered as follows : initial shocks , even if they exceed the capacity of the whole system ( not just the capacity of a single agent ) , are probably not the problem .",
    "of course , there are parameter regimes that lead to complete collapse ( @xmath85 ) . at the same time",
    ", we see that a change of @xmath61 of 10 or even 50 percent does not change the systemic risk very much . of much larger",
    "influence are system parameters related to the network topology , the safety margin , and the threshold distribution .",
    "as it was also found in other papers @xcite , an optimal heterogeneity in the agent s threshold can reduce systemic risk considerably .",
    "in addition to that we find that an change of the safety margin by 10 or 50 percent generates a much larger impact on systemic risk than a comparable change in the external shock .",
    "so , when seeking for protection against systemic risk the focus should be ( a ) on those parameters that influence the global stability , i.e. @xmath151 ( see above ) , and ( b ) on the optimal heterogeneity in the threshold distribution ."
