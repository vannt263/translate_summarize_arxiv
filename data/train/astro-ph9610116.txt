    "the luminosity  linewidth relation has become the most widely used technique for the determination of redshift  independent galaxy distances . while the relationship between kinematic and photometric parameters of spirals was investigated early on by roberts ( 1969 , 1975 ) , and ernst oepik applied it to derive a distance of 450 kpc to m31 in 1922  a much closer value to the true one than those around 200250 kpc commonly adopted until the 1950 s  , it is the merit of r.b .",

    "the tully  fisher ( tf ) relation was first obtained by correlating blue luminosity and the velocity width of the 21 cm line , as observed with telescopes that yield the integrated spectrum of the galaxy , rather than a map of the velocity field .",
    "since the technique requires that target galaxies be fairly inclined in order to minimize the amplitude of the corrections needed to recover the disk s rotational speed , it was realized early that uncertain corrections for internal extinction of the stellar flux would impose a serious limitation on the method .",
    "aaronson , huchra and mould ( 1980 ) adopted a photometric datum shifted to the h band , thus drastically reducing the amplitude of , and the error on internal extinction corrections . in the late 1980 s ,",
    "the advent of ccd devices stimulated the adoption of i and r band as the bandpasses of choice for tf work .",
    "sky background at those wavelengths is relatively low ( as compared to h and k bands ) , detectors have high efficiency and large fields and data acquisition is relatively fast even with small aperture telescopes .",
    "the population contributing most of the light at i band is comprised of solar  like stars , several gyr old .",
    "thus disks are well outlined but of smoother appearance than seen in the bluer parts of the visible spectrum , and their apparent inclinations to the line of sight can be reliably determined .",
    "moreover , processes operating in clusters that may alter the star formation rate in galaxies will have a retarded effect on the red and infrared light of disks ; thus , smaller  if any  systematic differences are expected between the tf relation of cluster and that of field galaxies , if i or r band photometry is used ( pierce and tully 1992 ) .",
    "hi single  dish linewidths sample effectively the outer regions of disks and yield values close to twice the asymptotic value of the rotational speed .",
    "they are also impervious to uncertainties on major axis position angle .",
    "however , not all sky is reachable by large aperture radio telescopes , and velocity widths have also been extensively derived from single ",
    "slit spectra , principally targeted at nebular h@xmath5 , n and s lines in the red part of the spectrum , and to a lesser extent from h@xmath5 fabry ",
    "perot imaging spectroscopy .",
    "hi synthesis imaging has so far had a small impact on this field of work , although the advent of broad  band spectrographs in arrays may make cluster tf work an advantageous proposition .",
    "much observational and theoretical work has been carried out on the tf relation , and a fair review of even the main individual works is impossible within the space constraints of this presentation .",
    "recent ccd tf work includes the surveys of pierce and tully ( 1988 , 1992 ) , han and mould ( 1992 ) , schommer ( 1993 ) , mathewson ( 1992 ) , courteau ( 1992 ) , willick ( 1990 ) , bernstein ( 1994 ) , bureau ( 1996 ) and giovanelli ( 1996 , hereafter g96 ) .",
    "by mid1996 , the tf distances of a few thousand galaxies had been estimated , principally with the purpose of determining the characteristics of the peculiar velocity field within @xmath6 .",
    "the investigation of the peculiar velocity ( @xmath7 ) field using the tf technique does _ not _ require an absolute distance calibration of the luminosity  width relation .",
    "the observed radial velocity of a galaxy at distance @xmath8 is @xmath9\\cdot   ( { \\bf d}/d ) \\eqno ( 1)\\ ] ] where * v*@xmath10 is the peculiar velocity vector and * v*@xmath11 its value at the observer s location . if the cmb dipole ( kogut 1993 ) is interpreted as a doppler shift , then in the cmb reference frame *",
    "tf yields the distance @xmath13 in .",
    "thus , a template with accurate slope and zero  point is required , such that any galaxy falling on the template can be considered at rest with respect to the comoving reference frame .",
    "a _ velocity calibration _ of the tf zero  point is necessary , which is introduced by assuming that the tf relation of one cluster , or the composite of a set of clusters define = 0 .",
    "section 4 deals with the process of establishing such calibration .",
    "once a reliable tf template is in hand , its luminosity scale can be absolutely calibrated by inspecting the location in the tf plane of galaxies with known distances , as obtained via primary indicators .",
    "this is equivalent to estimating .    in this presentation",
    ", the physical basis of the tf relation will be reviewed in section 2 , in terms of dynamical and scaling arguments . in section 3 ,",
    "the important issue of the scatter about the mean tf relation will be discussed : on it hinge not only the limits of applicability of the technique , but also the impact of bias .",
    "differences in estimate of the latter are largely responsible for wide discrepancies in inferences of both the value of the hubble constant and the amplitude of peculiar velocities , while the characteristics of scatter affect the issue of whether inverse formulations of the tf relation are bias  free tools . in section 4 ,",
    "the derivation of a template tf relation , from a sample of clusters spread between @xmath14 and 10,000 , will be presented , with emphasis on the treatment of the correction for bias . in sections 57 ,",
    "the tf template relation ( a ) will be calibrated using a set of nearby calibrators with available cepheid distances and ( b ) will be used to estimate the virgo and fornax clusters peculiar velocities .",
    "these determinations will be used to infer values of h@xmath15 . throughout this paper , the parametrization h@xmath16 will be used .",
    "there is no detailed physical understanding of the tf relation , the interpretation of which relies on simple scaling relations and dynamical arguments . in the scenario most recently discussed by eisenstein and loeb ( 1996 ) , consider a galaxy of mass @xmath17 collapsing from a spherical cloud at epoch @xmath18 ; the turnaround radius @xmath19 at that epoch is @xmath20 according to the spherical collapse model of gunn and gott ( 1972 ) for @xmath21 cosmologies .",
    "the total energy of the object after virialization is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is its velocity dispersion . assuming that a galaxy results from collapse at a single epoch and not from a succession of mergers , the combination of ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) yields @xmath24 so if all galaxies collapse in single events at the same epoch , and mass  to  light ratios do nt vary significantly @xmath25 .",
    "variations in the formation history of galaxy systems should be expected to introduce substantial scatter in the relation , as will be discussed in section 3 .    invoking an alternative set of scaling relations ,",
    "consider a pure exponential disk of central disk surface brightness @xmath26 and scale length @xmath27 ; its total luminosity is @xmath28 on the other hand , the mass internal to radius @xmath29 is @xmath30 , and if the rotation curve flattens in the outer regions of the disk as is usually the case for spiral galaxies , the total mass is @xmath31 combining eqns . ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , we can write @xmath32 if a dark matter halo is present so that the disk mass is @xmath33 , @xmath34 when a number of `` standard '' assumptions are made , i.e. that @xmath35 const , @xmath36 const and @xmath37 const ( freeman s law , 1970 ) , @xmath38 , which resembles the tf relation . in practice , none of the assumptions of constancy for @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath26 apply ; all those parameters exhibit mild dependencies on @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) , reducing the exponent to values @xmath43 , in a measure that depends on the adopted photometric band .",
    "empirical calibrations of the tf relation yield power law behavior as @xmath44 with values of @xmath45 in the i band .",
    "some workers ( e.g. aaronson et al . 1986 ; willick 1990 ; pierce and tully 1996 ) have found significant departures from a single power law behavior , and quadratic or bilinear tf fits have been adopted .",
    "it has been argued that inappropriate extinction corrections ( giovanelli et al .",
    "1995 ) or samples including a mixture of morphological types ( g96 ) may result in tf departures from linearity .",
    "there is however no _ a priori _ reason to expect that the tf relation be strictly linear .",
    "in order to correctly infer the predictive power of the tf method and to adequately estimate the amplitude of its biases , a fair understanding of the nature of the associated scatter and its sources is necessary .",
    "the scatter in the tf relation arises from several sources : errors in the _ measurement _ of tf parameters and uncertainties associated with the _ corrections _ applied to them combine with _ variance in the galactic properties _ produced by different formation and evolutive histories , characteristic of each object .",
    "the latter is often referred to as the _ intrinsic _ contribution to scatter , which may appear in the form of velocity field distortions , deviations from disk planarity , other gravitational and disk asymmetries , etc .",
    "several misconceptions regarding the nature of the tf scatter often appear in the literature : that it is well represented by a single number ; that the measurement and correction errors fully account for the observed dispersion ; that only errors on the velocity widths are important .",
    "g96 have made a detailed appraisal of the sources of i band tf scatter .",
    "their principal results , illustrated in figure 1 , are :    \\(i ) _ the total tf scatter can not be represented by a single value _ ; rather , _ it varies monotonically with the velocity width ( luminosity ) of the galaxy _ , as shown by the solid symbols and the heavy line in figure 1 . over the range of velocities generally used for tf studies , the r.m.s .",
    "scatter in magnitudes varies by a factor of @xmath46 , between 0.5 and 0.25 mag ( which translate in distance errors of respectively 25% and 12% ) .",
    "the use of low width objects is not particularly advantageous ( see hoffman & salpeter 1996 ) . rather , it is the high width galaxies that generally yield the highest accuracy .",
    "\\(ii ) _ measurement and processing errors are important contributors to , but they can not fully account for the amplitude of the total error_. average errors on the magnitude and on the widths are shown in figure 1 as dotted lines ( that on the width is multiplied by the tf slope so that it can be expressed in mags ) .",
    "it is clear that the _ intrinsic _ scatter makes an important contribution to the total error budget .",
    "such contribution varies between @xmath47 mag for low width objects and @xmath48 mag for high width ones . in figure 1 , the _ total measurement and processing error _ , @xmath49 , which is the result of the combination of magnitude ( @xmath50 ) and width ( @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the tf slope ) errors , is indicated by a thin , solid line . @xmath51 and @xmath50 are _ not _ added in quadrature , because errors in the two coordinates are coupled via inclination corrections .",
    "\\(iii ) measurement and processing errors on the magnitude can be important drivers of the scatter , especially for luminous , highly inclined galaxies .",
    "franx and de zeeuw ( 1992 ) have found that the tf scatter poses strong constraints on the elongation of the gravitational potential in the disk plane of spirals .",
    "their conclusion , that the average ellipticity of the potential in the plane of the disk must be smaller than about 0.06 , is reinforced by the scatter amplitude revealed in figure 1 .",
    "on the basis of 2.2 @xmath53 m photometry of 18 face  on spirals , rix and zaritsky ( 1995 ) find that departures from disk axisymmetry may contribute @xmath54 mag to the tf scatter .",
    "their conclusions apply principally to the inner regions of the disk , which are sampled by the k  band observations , and to tf scatter based on optical observations of the rotation field . when the tf relation is based on i band photometry and 21 cm spectroscopy ,",
    "the rix & zaritsky effect becomes of more ambiguous interpretation , as both the light and the hi emission arise in outer regions of disks .",
    "eisenstein and loeb ( 1996 ) estimate that the scatter resulting from varying formation histories of galaxies should exceed 0.3 mag for a broad class of cosmological scenarios .",
    "the relatively low values found for the intrinsic scatter in figure 1 suggest either an unexpectedly late epoch of galaxy formation or that a secular , regularizing feedback mechanism may be responsible for the tightness of the tf relation , as suggested by silk ( 1996 ) .",
    "sandage and collaborators ( 1994a , b ; 1995 ) advocate for a large value of the tf scatter , near or larger than 0.7 mag , as an explanation for the high values of the hubble constant resulting from the use of the tf relation .",
    "if the scatter were as large as proposed by that group , large biases would result ; their correction would change the zero  point of the tf template relation in the sense that the value of @xmath55 would be reduced . while the values of the scatter shown in figure 1 are not as low as advocated by other groups , it appears unlikely that the scatter may be as large as suggested by sandage .",
    "it has been advocated that the use of an _ inverse _ fit for the tf relation  one where the `` independent '' variable is the magnitude rather than the velocity width  does away with the need to correct for incompleteness bias ( e.g. schechter 1980 ) .",
    "the nature of the tf scatter , especially the fact that velocity width errors can be overshadowed by other sources , weakens the case for a bias ",
    "less inverse tf relation .",
    "the construction of a template relation is the most delicate aspect of any tf program . providing a large number of objects located at a common distance , and therefore exempt from the vagaries introduced by an _ a priori _ unknown peculiar velocity field in a field galaxy sample , clusters of galaxies are favorite targets for the determination of the properties of the tf relation .",
    "they are , however , not exempt from the necessity to evaluate and apply important corrections that take into consideration the interplay between scatter and sample completeness , the non  negligible line  of  sight extent of the cluster , corrections for morphological type mix and others .",
    "it is moreover necessary to verify whether a cluster s environment alters the photometric and kinematical properties of galaxies , so that the derived tf relation for the cluster may not be applicable to the field . in this section ,",
    "those issues are discussed principally in light of the results obtained by g96 , using a sample of galaxies in 24 clusters at @xmath56 between 1,000 and 10,000 .",
    "one commonly  adopted approach to the determination of a tf template relation is to select a single cluster of galaxies as a reference , thereby equating the universal template with the tf relation defined by its members .",
    "there are several problems with this approach . in order for the cluster to constrain well the tf slope ,",
    "a wide dynamic range in each of the tf parameters is desirable , which advocates for the use of a nearby cluster , in which less luminous galaxies can easily be targeted . such a cluster would , however , yield a highly uncertain zero point , since even a modest would result in a large magnitude offset .",
    "conversely , a distant cluster , for which the latter problem would be minimized , would provide lax constraint for the tf slope .",
    "a single cluster sample is moreover unlikely to contain more than two or three dozens of objects , which would produce a template of very poor statistical definition .",
    "tf relations of very low scatter are sometimes found in such cases , which reflect far more the capriciousness of small  number statistics than exceptional data quality . in those cases ,",
    "low scatter is seldom accompanied by accurate slope and zero  point .",
    "the alternative approach is that of using a set of clusters rather than a single one .",
    "more distant clusters in the set can effectively provide an estimate of the velocity zero point , while the nearby ones can help constrain the tf slope .",
    "the combination of the various data sets from several clusters does however require the simultaneous estimate of their relative , as well as of the bias and other corrections that apply differentially to each .",
    "the procedures followed in obtaining such a combination are discussed as follows .",
    "much has been written on the ways of estimating the incompleteness bias , which results from the interplay between the degree of completeness of a sample and the amplitude of the tf scatter relation ( e.g. bottinelli 1986 ; sandage 1994a ; sandage 1995 ; teerikorpi 1993 and refs . therein ) .",
    "the nature of the bias is illustrated in the simulation shown in figure 2 , where    a ` cluster sample ' is extracted from a population with a luminosity function ( lf ) as shown by the smooth curve plotted along the vertical axis .",
    "the extracted sample is however incomplete , as the histogram of magnitudes superimposed on the lf shows .",
    "incompleteness exhibits a `` soft '' edge , indicated by the progressive departure of the histogram from the lf . for a flux ",
    "limited sample , the histogram would of course track the lf for magnitudes brighter than the limit , then level suddenly to zero .",
    "the tf law assigned to the simulated data ( utf ) is represented by a dashed line , with a scatter twice as large as that illustrated in figure 1 , averaging about 0.7 mag .",
    "the magnified scatter serves to dramatize the bias .",
    "a heavy solid line connects filled symbols which identify mean values of the magnitude within bins of velocity width .",
    "incompleteness affects the tf relation derived from the simulated sample in several important ways : ( i ) the derived slope is less steep than that of the utf ; ( ii ) the zero  point is brighter than that of the utf ; ( iii ) the scatter is underestimated with respect to that of the utf .",
    "correction recipes for the incompleteness bias have been given in a variety of studies , most recently those by teerikorpi ( 1993 and refs .",
    "therein ) , willick ( 1994 ) , sandage ( 1995 ) and g96 . unlike most other works , which propose analytical or graphic solutions to the problem , g96",
    "give a solution obtained via monte carlo simulations , which applies to the case when the tf relation is obtained by fitting magnitude on the logarithm of the velocity width , taking into simultaneous account errors on both coordinates .",
    "this case , referred to as the _ bivariate _ fit , differs fron the one usually referred to as the _ direct _ fit , in which only errors in magnitude are taken into account .",
    "the computation of bias corrections does of course depend on the chosen type of fit .",
    "the incompleteness bias generally increases with increasing distance to the cluster .",
    "it is principally driven by the amplitude of the tf scatter .",
    "an important source of uncertainty in its application is related to the shape of the lf of the galaxy population from which the cluster sample is extracted .",
    "g96 estimate that the effect of this uncertainty on that of the tf zero  point is @xmath57 mag",
    ".      early work by roberts ( 1978 ) , de vaucouleurs ( 1982 ) and others showed that in the blue part of the visible spectrum there are significant differences in tf behavior among galaxies of different morphological types .",
    "aaronson and mould ( 1983 ) found such differences to be imperceptible when h band photometry is used . at i band ,",
    "g96 find a weak but significant difference in the zero point between early and late  type spirals , sa and sab galaxies being less luminous , at a given width , than sbc and sc galaxies . because cluster samples often include a sizable fraction of early  type spirals , an adjustment for the mixing needs to be made .",
    "in figure 3 , the residuals from the i band tf template relation are shown as a function of projected radial distance from the center of clusters . in panels ( b ) and",
    "( c ) galaxies are separated between the high and low richness halves of the 24 cluster set of g96 , while in panel ( a ) the total cluster sample is displayed at once .",
    "there is no significant evidence of differential tf behavior among spirals , on the basis of their projected cluster location .      using 14 clusters with @xmath58 to define the zero  point and the whole set of 24 clusters to constrain the slope , g96 obtain a template relation based on the data shown in figure 4 , after the necessary corrections for bias , morphology ,",
    "cluster extent and peculiar velocity have been applied .",
    "the plot includes 555 galaxies .",
    "the best bivariate fit is @xmath59 the statistical errors on the coefficients are small , but as we shall see they are not the principal contributors to the uncertainty of the peculiar velocities inferred using the template .",
    "the final step in the calibration of the tf relation towards deriving an estimate of relies on the availability of primary distances for galaxies with tf parameters of adequate quality .",

    "clear distortions are discernible : warps , tidal perturbations and other asymmetries reduce the reliability for tf calibration ( e.g. m31 , m33 and m81 ) .",
    "other systems are dwarf irregulars ( e.g. ngc 2366 and ngc 3109 ) , and thus ill - suited for use with the g96 template which is principally constructed using luminous spirals .",

    "our assignment of error bars to the data are thus reflective of this unorthodox method of parameter derivation , rather than of the original accuracy of the data .",
    "in figure 5 , the data of all galaxies in table 1 are plotted over a grid of renditions of the template relation , derived as discussed in section 4.4 and shifted according to values of the hubble parameter ranging between @xmath68 and @xmath69 . keeping the slope of the tf template fixed , we compute the value of @xmath70 that yields @xmath71 minimization of residuals for the set of calibrators .",
    "the statistical uncertainty of the derivation , based on the assigned errors to the velocity widths and absolute magnitudes of the calibrators , is small .",
    "if we use all the galaxies listed in table 1 , the resulting best fit value is @xmath72 .",

    "very large galaxies , for example , pose difficulties in the estimation of magnitudes because of problems associated with the determination of the sky brightness level , and the assumed 0.1 mag measurement error may in some cases be too small .",
    "corrections to widths , necessary to bring them to an internally compatible system , as well as commensurable with the data used to obtain the template relation , are also quite uncertain , when the data originate in as heterogenous a set of data sources as in this case . a realistic appraisal of the error arising from measurements and corrections applied to the tf parameters may be significantly larger than the statistical estimates given above .",
    "more conservatively than in table 1 , we shall assume that uncertainties in the calibrators tf parameters contribute @xmath75 mag to the error budget .",

    "the peculiar velocities of virgo and fornax are of particular interest since several of the most recent cepheid distance determinations correspond to galaxies thought to be members of those clusters . while the route to estimating a value of via the tf template relation followed in the preceding section is more accurate , it is useful to have at hand estimates of the of the two clusters , which in combination with their systemic velocities and distances can yield local estimates of .",

    "both values assume a systemic recesssion velocity for the cluster of @xmath91 , measured again in the cmb reference frame . if fornax lies at the distance of ngc 1365 , of @xmath92 mpc ( silbermann 1996 ) , and if its hubble velocity @xmath93 , then @xmath94 .",
    "virgo is not one of the clusters studied by g96 .",
    "we have , however , used the i band data of pierce and tully ( 1992 ) and of pierce ( 1988 ) , and selected a sample of galaxies reputed to be members of the ` a ' clump , according to the criteria of binggeli ( 1985 ; 1993 ) .",
