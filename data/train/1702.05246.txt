    "information is obscured behind the horizon as reflected in the black hole information paradox @xcite .",
    "there have been several solutions to this paradox , and there will be more until the fulfilment of the quantum theory of gravity . in most solutions to the paradox , one should take into consideration of the area , volume and singularity of black holes .",
    "for example , in reference @xcite , stanford and susskind proposed that the complexity of a state on the anti - de sitter ( ads ) boundary is proportional to the maximal spatial volume of the einstein - rosen bridge anchored at the boundary state .",
    "this refines susskind s earlier conjecture @xcite that the complexity is proportional to the length of the einstein - rosen bridge . and",
    "it is later superseded by an elaborated conjecture @xcite relating the complexity to the action of a wheeler - dewitt patch . among the three conjectures ,",
    "we feel that the complexity / volume duality conjecture is visually the most elegant though not perfect yet .",
    "apparently independent of the above stream , christodoulou and rovelli define the volume of a black hole as the volume of maximal spacelike hypersurface bounded by the event horizon @xcite .",
    "this was initially illustrated in details with spherically symmetric spacetime , such as the schwarzschild and the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black holes .",
    "later , more efforts were made on the extension to the kerr black hole @xcite , the relations between volume and entropy @xcite , and the effects of hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "so far the main attention has been paid on interior volume of black holes with curvature singularities , except for a very recent work @xcite which turned to non - commutative black holes . as emphasized by references @xcite , to resolve the information paradox , despite the potentially important role of volumes",
    ", we should not ignore the singularity . in the present paper",
    ", we will explore the case without curvature singularity , specifically two examples : the volume inside regular black holes in sections [ sect - rbh ] and [ sect - ads ] , and the volume outside the de sitter ( ds ) horizon in section [ sect - ds ] .",
    "although developed independently , the black hole volume defined by christodoulou and rovelli ought to be useful for the complexity / volume duality in the infinite - time limit @xcite , as we will emphasize in section [ sect - ads ] .",
    "remember that the complexity is defined for a state on the ads boundary .",
    "therefore , to apply the complexity / volume duality , we should restrict our investigations to black holes in asymptotically ads spacetime .",
    "but in section [ sect - rbh ] the examples collected from literature @xcite are asymptotically flat at spatial infinity .",
    "fortunately , an asymptotically ads regular black hole was constructed recently by fan in reference @xcite , see more solutions in reference @xcite .",
    "partially inspired by his work , in appendix [ app - cc ] , we will demonstrate a prescription to switch on cosmological constant in a class of solutions for the einstein gravity .",
    "this prescription can be applied to all solutions in section [ sect - rbh ] to get their ads counterparts . in section [ sect - ads ] , to such asymptotically ads solutions we will apply christodoulou and rovelli s definition of black hole volume together with stanford and susskind s conjecture of complexity / volume duality .",
    "some loose ends will be discussed in section [ sect - disc ] .",
    "throughout this paper , we will work in units in which @xmath0 , and restrict our study to @xmath1-dimensional spherical static spacetimes described by the line element @xmath2 where @xmath3 . using the advanced time @xmath4 ,",
    "it can be rewritten as @xmath5 a specific form of the lapse function @xmath6 dictates a special spacetime .",
    "for instance , the rn spacetime is determined by a lapse function of the form @xmath7 in the chargeless case @xmath8 , it reduces to the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "it is well known that both the schwarzschild and the rn black holes have a curvature singularity at the spatial origin @xmath9 inside the event horizon .",
    "in contrast , regular black holes retain event horizons but get rid of curvature singularities . in reference",
    "@xcite , ayon - beato and garcia showed in a specific example that regular black holes are solutions to einstein equations coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics . since then many solutions of regular black hole have been constructed in the literature .",
    ".the lapse function of some regular black holes asymptotic to flat spacetime at @xmath10 . to facilitate comparison ,",
    "we have transformed the model parameters into the mass @xmath11 and the charge @xmath12",
    ". please refer to original references for details .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     second , in the complexity / volume duality , there is a length scale undetermined .",
    "as mentioned in reference @xcite , the original complexity / volume duality @xcite stated that the complexity of the boundary state is proportional to the spatial volume @xmath13 of a maximal slice behind the horizon , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a length scale that has to be chosen appropriately for the configuration . for schwarzschild - ads black holes ,",
    "@xmath15 is typically chosen as the ads radius for large black holes and the schwarzschild radius for small black holes @xcite .",
    "however , there is no universal form of @xmath15 , especially for intermediate - sized black holes and charged black holes that we want to study .",
    "in fact , that was why brown et .",
    "al . turned to the complexity / action duality in references @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will tentatively circumvent the second obstacle by exploring the possibility that @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a constant to be determined soon , @xmath18 is the radius of outer horizon , and the hawking temperature @xmath19 . for schwarzschild - ads black holes , one may check that , as has been expected , @xmath20 if @xmath21 and @xmath22 if @xmath23 . we will fix @xmath17 by demanding that small schwarzschild - ads black holes saturate the complexity growth bound proposed in references @xcite @xmath24 and then check this bound and ansatz with asymptotically ads regular black holes .",
    "this is far from an exhaustive investigation , which would involve the finite - time einstein - rosen bridge and other geometries beyond the scope of this paper .    for simplicity",
    ", we replace the integral in inequality with @xmath25 .",
    "they are approximately the same for small black holes , but not for near - extremal large black holes @xcite .",
    "therefore , our results for large black holes in the near - extremal regime will have some uncertainties and should be taken with caution .",
    "recalling that the bekenstein - hawking entropy @xmath26 , one can rewrite inequality concretely as @xmath27 limited to small schwarzschild - ads black holes , one has @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 at large @xmath31 . in this limit",
    ", the complexity growth bound can be well saturated if and only if @xmath32 .",
    "normalized to the schwarzschild limit , the complexity growth bound now takes the form of a bound on the volume of black holes , @xmath33 this inequality can be numerically tested with black holes in table [ tab - ads ] .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure [ fig - ads ] , where the left hand side of inequality is depicted by red solid curves , and the right hand side by black dashed curves .",
    "for comparison , in the bottom panels we presented results for the rn - ads black hole , which is characterized by the lapse function @xmath34 in all of the left panels , @xmath35 , which is the case of intermediate - sized black holes .",
    "in right panels , @xmath36 , the case of large black holes . in every panel , we can see the red solid curve follows the black dashed curve closely .",
    "this suggests that the complexity growth bound is roughly saturated in all cases .",
    "although not to be taken too seriously , it is quite impressive that the red solid curve lies slightly below the black dashed curve in most panels , which means the bound is not violated .",
    "the only exception is ads - rbhe with @xmath37 , which appears to violate the bound . in section [ sect - disc ]",
    "we will give some important comments on these results .",

    "let us first consider the volume inside the ds horizon , which is conventionally calculated by integrate the volume measure of metric at constant time @xmath44 , that is @xmath45 agreeably , the same result can be also obtained with christodoulou and rovelli s recipe by maximizing the integral @xmath46 in the range @xmath47 .",

    "unfortunately , it is divergent in the limit @xmath10 . even if one sets @xmath49 to a finite value by hand , the integrand is divergent linearly as @xmath10 .",
    "the estimation is also ruined here , because deriving relies on the condition that @xmath52 spans a finite region .",
    "to proceed , we revise this volume to a tamable form @xmath53\\\\ & = & \\lim_{r_c\\rightarrow\\infty}4\\pi\\int_{\\ell}^{r_c}dr\\frac{r^4}{\\sqrt{r^4f(r)-r_c^4f(r_c)}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have introduced a cutoff radius @xmath54 which is pushed to infinity after maximization . at large @xmath54",
    ", the volume outside ds horizon grows quadratically with cutoff radius , @xmath55 this equation involves the gamma function and the hypergeometric function . in figure [ fig - ds ]",
    "we have numerically evaluated the first , the third and the last lines of this equation , depicted by black solid , purple dotted and blue dashed lines respectively .",
    "they coincide at large @xmath54 .    .",
    "the black solid line , the purple dotted line and the blue dashed line depict numerical result of the first , the third and the last lines of equation respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ] +    in the second line of equation , we kept only the quadratic term in the lapse function .",
    "therefore , we expect this equation holds not only for pure ds spacetime , but also for asymptotically ds spacetime with black holes inside the ds horizon .",
    "as proposed by christodoulou and rovelli , the volume of a black hole can be defined as the volume of maximal spacelike hypersurface bounded by the event horizon @xcite . in the present paper , we have investigated the implications of this proposal for some spacetimes with event horizons but free of singularity : asymptotically flat regular black holes , asymptotically ads regular black holes , and the ds spacetime .",
    "the asymptotically ads regular black holes are generated by a prescription demonstrated in appendix [ app - cc ] , which should be useful for studying solutions to einstein equations coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics .    restricted to regular black holes asymptotic to the ads spacetime at spatial infinity , in section [ sect - ads ] we explored the conjectures of complexity / volume duality @xcite and complexity growth bound @xcite , assuming a length scale . in figure [ fig - ads ] , we found the bound is nearly saturated in all examples and slightly violated in only one case .",
    "these behaviors are encouraging . in spite of the good behaviors",
    ", we should warn the readers that the length scale is ad hoc , and our primitive exploration in section [ sect - ads ] relies on the estimation @xmath56 .",
    "both of these approximations should be refined in an exhaustive study with rn - ads and kerr - ads black holes as well as other geometries , which is out of the scope this paper .",
    "we plan to return to this question in a future work .",

    "the authors would like to thank yu - chen ding for helpful discussions .",
    "many solutions of regular black hole have been constructed in the literature , especially after ayon - beato and garcia proposed the nonlinear - electrodynamics interpretation in reference @xcite .",
    "most of them are of the spherical static form on which we focus in this paper .",
    "as we will demonstrate in this appendix , in the einstein gravity , there is a simple prescription to switch on cosmological constant in this class of solutions , including both regular and singular ones .    for this class of solutions",
    ", the symmetry implies that the nonvanishing components of electromagnetic strength are @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for clarity ,",
    "let us introduce notations @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , raising the indices with metric , we find @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the key point is that the lapse function @xmath6 does not appear in the expression of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    in the einstein gravity , when the matter field is given by nonlinear electrodynamics , from the full action @xcite @xmath65 % i=\\frac{1}{16\\pi}\\int d^4x\\sqrt{-g}\\left[r+6\\ell^{-2}-\\mathcal{l}(\\mathcal{f})\\right]\\ ] ] in which @xmath66 , one can write down the einstein equations @xmath67 as well as the nonlinear electrodynamic equations @xmath68 substituting line element and the expression of electromagnetic strength , we can put them in the form @xmath69 @xmath70 with @xmath71 note that the lapse function @xmath6 disappears in the electromagnetic equations",
    ". we also note by passing that equations , are unchanged if one replaces @xmath6 with @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a constant . for regular black holes , this",
    "constant is always set to zero to avoid a curvature singularity at the origin @xcite .",
    "now we are ready to go to spacetimes asymptotic to ds / ads at spatial infinity @xmath10 . for concreteness , we will focus on the ads case with a cosmological constant @xmath74 .",
    "of course , it is easy to adjust our results to the ds case by reversing the signature of @xmath75 .    switching on the cosmological constant in action is equivalent to replacing @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "what is more , one can check that equations , are unchanged under the following replacement @xmath78 that is to say , _ in the einstein gravity , from an asymptotically flat solution of the spherical static form , one can get an asymptotically ads solution by replacing the lapse function @xmath6 with @xmath79 , leaving intact the electromagnetic field . _    99 p.  chen , y.  c.  ong and d.  h.  yeom , phys .",
