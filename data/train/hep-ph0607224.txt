    "for the investigation of qcd in the strongly coupled regime , non - perturbative numerical methods such as lattice qcd and truncated dyson - schwinger equations can be employed .",
    "similar to lattice qcd , numerical dyson - schwinger studies of qcd n - point functions are usually performed in euclidean space ( for recent reviews see  @xcite ) .",
    "although dyson - schwinger studies rely on truncation schemes , they have the great advantage , that they can in principle be solved in the continuum limit and with much higher numerical accuracy .",
    "an extraction of dynamical properties , in particular the spectral functions of propagators , is however highly desirable . in quantum monte carlo simulations , the maximum entropy method ( mem )",
    "turns out to be an especially suited tool and has been successfully applied in condensed matter physics ( see  @xcite for a review ) , lattice qcd in the vacuum ( see  @xcite for a review ) , as well as at finite temperatures  @xcite . in this work",
    "we show , that it can also successfully be employed for the extraction of spectral functions in dyson - schwinger studies .",
    "the starting point for the mem is the linear relation between the spectral function and numerically determined euclidean correlation functions via generalized kllen - lehmann representations .",
    "since the inversion of the latter is in general ill - posed due to the spectral properties of the linear operator , further knowledge has to be implemented non - linearly .",
    "this can be done from a regularization point of view leading to the `` historical maximum entropy ''  @xcite or in a bayesian approach leading to the `` classic maximum entropy ''  @xcite and to `` bryan s method ''  @xcite .",
    "the key idea in the latter case is the interpretation of the spectral function as a probability distribution due to its special properties and a proper consideration of the numerical error . as a result",
    ", the mem determines the most plausible or expected spectral function for a given euclidean correlator with known errors and some prior knowledge .",
    "it does not rely on a special form of the function and should , with decreasing errors , converge towards the exact solution .    for numerical dyson - schwinger studies",
    ", the method seems especially reliable , since the calculations can usually be performed with much higher numerical accuracy and for much more momentum points of the correlators than in lattice qcd .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ specfunc ] we collect those properties of spectral functions for fermions and bosons , which make them suitable for the application of the mem . in section  [ mem ]",
    "we discuss the mem procedure itself , in particular its adaptation to dyson - schwinger studies and to fermions . in section  [ numimpl ]",
    "we sketch the numerical implementation . after this",
    "we show in section  [ colddense ] some results for massless color - superconducting fermions in dense quark - gluon matter .",
    "finally we summarize and conclude in section  [ sumconc ] .",
    "performing calculations for propagators in euclidean space or rather within the imaginary time formalism means the determination of matsubara propagators .",
    "these are related to spectral functions in minkowski space via the generalized kllen - lehmann representation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . using the euclidean conventions of  @xcite we have @xmath0 for a dirac fermion propagator , where @xmath1 denotes a given matsubara frequency and @xmath2",
    "is the chemical potential .",
    "the spectral function is given by @xmath3 therefore @xmath4 is hermitian and has only positive eigenvalues in a given hilbert space .",
    "furthermore it has to fulfill the sum rule @xmath5 as a consequence of the ( anti-)commutation relations .",
    "thus @xmath4/4 can be identified with a probability distribution , which is the key property for motivating the use of the mem .    for a massive relativistic fermion in an isotropic ,",
    "even parity and @xmath6-symmetric phase , we can parameterize @xmath7 and knowing that all eigenvalues have to be positive , we get @xmath8 and furthermore the sum rules @xmath9    for the application discussed in section  [ colddense ] , we will for simplicity restrict ourself to the chiral limit , i.e. massless fermions ( the case of massive fermions is discussed at the end of section 3 ) . in this case",
    ", we can rewrite the propagators by using the energy projectors @xmath10 and obtain @xmath11 the spectral functions @xmath12 then fulfill @xmath13 with @xmath14    for completeness we also wish to show , how the solutions of the inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) can be used to determine the spectral functions of mesons or diquarks . for a given current @xmath15 ,",
    "the solution for the corresponding bethe - salpeter amplitude @xmath16 in momentum space ( see e.g.  @xcite ) determines the time - ordered product @xmath17 such that the current - current correlator is given by @xmath18 with @xmath19 again @xmath20 possesses a generalized kllen - lehmann representation and the spectral function has to fulfill positivity conditions .",
    "the maximum entropy method is a numerical tool for the inversion of potentially ill - posed linear equations by the implementation of additional information , i.e. constraints .",
    "it can be easily viewed from a standpoint of regularization as adding some non - linear auxiliary conditions , leading to the so - called `` historical maximum entropy ''  @xcite .",
    "this is known to underfit the data by overestimating the effective number of degrees of freedom , thus leading to solutions that are closer to the prior estimate .",
    "usually , the somewhat converse bayesian viewpoint is considered , since it essentially adjusts the number of effective degrees of freedom and also allows for an error estimation  @xcite .",
    "we briefly review this here , emphasizing the adaption to our problem .    given a ( numerically evaluated ) euclidean correlator , which is treated as data @xmath21 , the objective is to determine the most plausible ( related to `` classic maximum entropy ''  @xcite ) or the most expected ( related to `` bryan s method ''  @xcite ) spectral function @xmath22 by taking into account prior knowledge @xmath23 of the solution , regulated by the prior estimate @xmath24 to be defined below .",
    "the key entity is the plausibility functional @xmath25 $ ] for the spectral function @xmath26 under given @xmath21 and @xmath23 . with help of the so called `` bayesian theorem '' for conditional plausibilities @xmath27 = p[x|y]p[y ] = p[y|x]p[x],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this can be brought into the form @xmath28 & = & \\frac{p[d|\\rho h(m)]p[\\rho|h(m)]}{p[d|h(m ) ] }    \\nonumber\\\\&\\propto &    p[d|\\rho h(m)]p[\\rho|h(m)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we have introduced the `` likelihood function '' @xmath29 $ ] for the plausibility of the data @xmath21 under given @xmath26 and @xmath23 and the `` prior probability '' @xmath30 $ ] for the plausibility of @xmath26 under the prior knowledge @xmath23 . the constant plausibility @xmath31 $ ] of the data @xmath21 under the prior knowledge @xmath23 can be dropped , since we normalize the plausibility functional at the end .    considering the function ( or sequence at finite temperature ) @xmath21 in an interval @xmath32 $ ] as uncorrelated data points obeying a gaussian distribution functional , we have @xmath33 & = & \\exp\\left(-l\\left[\\rho\\right]\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the likelihood @xmath34    & = &    \\frac{1}{b - a}\\,\\int_{a}^{b}\\!dp_{4 }    \\frac{|d(p_{4})-d[\\rho](p_{4})|^{2}}{2\\sigma(p_{4})^{2 } }    \\nonumber\\\\&\\simeq &    \\frac{1}{b - a }    \\sum_{i}\\delta p_{4,i }    \\frac{|d_{i}-d[\\rho]_{i}|^{2}}{2\\sigma_{i}^{2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 $ ] is given by the generalized kllen - lehmann representation and a measure @xmath36 for the discretized integral @xmath37    the prior probability @xmath30 $ ] is usually somewhat arbitrary and essentially implements the positivity conditions non - linearly , at least from the regularization point of view .",
    "it can be motivated by the law of large numbers or axiomatically constructed ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the key idea in the latter case is to consider the spectral function as a probability distribution and derive the most general functional , fulfilling the requirements of subset independence , coordinate invariance , system independence and scaling .",

    "it can also be adopted to the knowledge from other methods .",
    "since the main purpose is the implementation of positivity , the results turn out to be comparatively insensitive to its choice .",
    "the advantage of our method is that , after an eventual test calculation , we can choose the discretization , i.e. the abscissas and weights , of the spectral function , such that it is interpolated by a small number of points .",

    "( [ specreppm ] ) . for the bare normal quark propagator with a constant gap @xmath99 , the spectral function",
    "is then given by @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "we will see below , how a non - trivial @xmath103-dependence generates a finite width .      as described in section  [ mem ] , the main input for",
    "the mem is the data with a proper error estimate . in dyson - schwinger studies ,",
    "these are obtained by self - consistent solutions of truncated integral equations .",
    "to lowest order , the error of @xmath104 therefore scales with the error of the numerical integrals , which determine the normal and anomal self energies @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( see  @xcite for details ) . in our case , we have chosen a simple riemann quadrature for the multidimensional integrals , due to the principle - value - type behavior around the fermi surface for ungapped channels .",
    "the error is therefore of order @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is a scaling factor of the integration mesh . for the error estimation",
    ", we therefore calculate the propagator for two different @xmath108 and extrapolate linearly to @xmath109 .",
    "the data are then taken as the result for the smaller scaling factor @xmath108 and the error as the difference between these data and the extrapolated result .",
    "in addition , the errors around nearest neighbors are averaged in order to avoid ( artifically appearing ) vanishing errors",
    ".    we also have to justify , that correlations between the data points are negligible for the likelihood in the form given in eq .",
    "( [ likel ] ) .",
    "since our numerical integrals for different values of @xmath103 are in principle independent , this is assumed to be true , at least when the discretized data is coarser than the numerical integral of the self energies .",
    "the input data for @xmath97 for the following example is chosen on an interval @xmath110 $ ] for the gapped channel in the @xmath94 phase at a quark chemical potential of @xmath95 . as an illustration , the input for momentum @xmath111 is shown in fig .",
    "[ datasplus ] .",
    "we consider the input as continuous due to our many data points and it has small errors of less than @xmath112 in absolute value above @xmath113 .      for the data input with given errors , we now need to choose an interval for the spectral function and a non - vanishing prior estimate .",
    "we take the comparatively large interval @xmath114 $ ] .",
    "furthermore we choose an interval for @xmath56 $ ] as discussed in the following subsection . for different prior estimates @xmath115 and @xmath116 at momentum @xmath111 , we then obtain the most expected spectral functions as shown in fig .",
    "[ varym ] .",
    "it turns out , that the extracted spectral function is remarkably insensitive on the variation of the prior estimate , even when varying it by more than three orders of magnitude .",
    "this is mainly related to the small errors of our data .",
    "we therefore fix @xmath117 in the following .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the @xmath39-dependence of the maximum of the functional @xmath88 $ ] as well as of @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath56 $ ] shows a pronounced maximum at @xmath118 , we choose the interval @xmath119 $ ] for @xmath56 $ ] to be non - vanishing and normalized , such that @xmath56>10^{-1}\\times p[\\alpha_{max}|dh(m)]$ ] for @xmath120 .",

    "they are only weakly varying , even when comparing the border of the interval @xmath64 to the maximum .",
    "this also substantiates laplace s rule for @xmath123 $ ] a posteriori , assuming that its @xmath39-dependence is weaker .    apart from this , in fig .",
    "[ palpha ] , the most expected spectral function is equal to the most probable spectral function given at @xmath118 and therefore not shown .",
    "thus the `` classic maximum entropy '' gives very similar results as `` bryan s method '' in our case of `` many '' data points and small errors .",
    "finally we are able to perform an error estimation around the expected value of a given interval .",
    "since we have two pronounced peaks for quasiparticles and quasiparticle - holes in the spectral function , we choose the intervals associated to their full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "the result for momentum @xmath111 is shown on the right in fig .",
    "[ rho2sc ] . again , the errors turn out to be very small .    on the left - hand side",
    "we show a contour plot of the spectral density as a function of the energy @xmath124 and momentum @xmath125 .",
    "the light ( online yellow ) line shows the maxima of the quasiparticle and quasiparticle - hole branches . for fixed momentum @xmath125 ,",
    "the difference between the dark ( online blue ) lines below and above the light ( online yellow ) line gives the fwhm of the corresponding peak .",
    "the latter is neglected in bcs - type spectral functions as given in eq .",

    "in this paper we have outlined , how the mem can be adapted to numerical dyson - schwinger studies , in particular to fermions . it turns out , that the extracted spectral functions are much more reliable and stable against variation , than in applications of the mem in lattice qcd .",
