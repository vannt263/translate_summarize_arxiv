    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most energetic electromagnetic events in the universe ( e.g. piran 2000 ; mszros 2002 ) .",
    "different models have been developed to explain the physical origin of these bursts .",
    "it is now widely believed that lgrbs are principally associated with the star core collapse into a black hole during a type ib / c supernova ( sn ) event ( macfayden , woosley & heger 2001 ) .",
    "this model , also known as the collapsar scenario , is linked to the evolution of single , massive stars which have mean lifetimes of several million years , implying a negligible typical lifetime for lgrb progenitors in cosmological terms . from this point of view",
    ", these events are commonly considered as possible unbiased tracers of the cosmic star formation history up to high redshift .",
    "however , this is still a controversial point due to different sources of bias such as dust extinction intrinsic to the host ( e.g. jakobsson et al . 2005 ; priddey et al . 2006 ) .",
    "also , the presence of metals in the progenitor star could play a significant role in the generation of lgrbs , introducing a bias .",
    "the metallicity of the progenitor star is an important input parameter for the collapsar model .",
    "high metallicity stars are able to develop strong stellar winds which lead to the loss of both mass and angular momentum . in the case of the collapsar model , this can prevent the generation of lgrbs ( e.g. macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) . in this model , grbs can only be formed by massive , single stars with a metallicity below @xmath4 ( hirschi et al . 2005 ; woosley & hegger 2006 ) .",
    "if grbs are associated to the formation of massive stars , they might provide information on the star forming regions in galaxies at different redshifts ( e.g. mao & mo 1998 ; hogg & fruchter 1999 ) .",
    "however , only recently it has been possible to obtain more insight into the properties of the hgs as discussed by le floch et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter lf03 ) and savaglio , glazebrook & le borgne ( 2006 ) , among others .",
    "these works find a trend for the hgs to be sub - luminous and bluer with higher star formation activity than luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "recent observations also provide information on the chemical abundances of the hgs at different redshifts ( sollerman et al .",
    "2005 ; savaglio et al .",
    "2006 ; stanek et al . 2006 ; wolf & podsiadlowski 2006 ; fynbo et al .",
    "these results suggest that hgs could be low metallicity galaxies compared with star - burst galaxies ( see also fruchter et al .",
    "conselice et al .",
    "( 2005 ) studied a sample of 37 hgs of lgrbs up to @xmath5 , finding that , at @xmath6 , hgs seem to be smaller than the average galaxy population while , at higher redshifts , hgs are more similar to the general galaxy population .",
    "the recent detection of lgrbs at @xmath7 probes that these events could also provide a unique physical technique for the identification of galaxies at very early stages of their evolution , which can not be spotted with usual methods ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 ; berger et al .",
    "2006 ) . the combination of this information with other observational results for high redshift galaxies ( e.g. chen et al . 2005 ; starling et al .",
    "2005 ) opens the possibility for a new stage in the study of the chemical enrichment of the universe by extending our knowledge to a very early epoch of galaxy formation .",
    "galaxy formation models could help us to test different possible grb scenarios , provided that the connection between the star formation activity and the triggering of grb events is valid . within a cosmological framework ( in particular in the @xmath0cdm concordance model )",
    ", the formation of galaxies is a complex process where the structure is assembled in a highly non - linear way .",
    "numerical simulations have proven to be a powerful tool to study the formation of structure in this regime .",
    "in particular , smoothed particle hydrodynamical codes are able to describe the joint evolution of dark matter and baryons while allowing the treatment of specific processes such as star formation , chemical evolution and sn energy feedback ( e.g. katz & gunn 1991 ; navarro & white 1993 ; mosconi et al .",
    "2001 ; springel & hernquist 2003 ; scannapieco et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "recently , courty , bjrnsson & gudmunsson ( 2004 ) made use of hydrodynamical structure formation simulations with the aim at identifying galaxy populations capable of reproducing the general observational features of the hgs .",
    "these authors find that , by requiring the hgs to have high star formation efficiency , the observed hg luminosity distribution could be reproduced .    in this work",
    ", we developed a monte carlo code for simulating the triggering of lgrb events assuming the collapsar model for their progenitor stars as described by fryer , woosley & hartmann ( 1999 , hereafter fwh99 ) .",
    "the lgrb code is then coupled to hydrodynamical cosmological simulations so that the generation of lgrbs can be followed as the structure forms and evolves .",
    "we used hydrodynamical simulations performed with the chemical gadget-2 code of scannapieco et al .",
    "this code can follow the chemical enrichment of baryons as the structure forms .",
    "the dynamical and chemical properties of the simulated hgs are analyzed and confronted with available observations .",
    "however , the simulations analyzed in this paper do not include sn energy feedback .",
    "this process is expected to be able to trigger strong , metal - loaded , galactic winds capable of transporting material out of the galaxies , affecting the dynamics of the systems .",
    "although sn energy feedback is an important physical mechanism , its modellization in hydrodynamical simulations is still controversial and only recently new numerical algorithms seem to be able to self - consistently take it into account ( marri & white 2003 ; scannapieco et al .",
    "for this reason , in this work , we concentrate on the chemical enrichment of baryons which is regulated by the gravitational growth of the structure and gas cooling , leaving for a future work the treatment of sn energy feedback . considering the critical dependence of the collapsar model on the metallicity of the progenitor star , the possibility of estimating the metallicity of the simulated stars self - consistently provides us with a powerful tool to study lgrb host galaxies .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the simulated galaxy catalogues used in this work .",

    "we used the synthetic galaxy catalogues constructed by de rossi , tissera & scannapieco ( 2006 ) from a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation of a typical region of the universe consistent with a concordance cosmogony with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 with @xmath14 .",

    "this code provides the history of enrichment of each element of fluid by individual chemical elements such as , e.g. fe@xmath17 and o@xmath18 as the structure is assembled in consistency with the adopted cosmology .",

    "the simulated volume corresponds to a periodic box of 10 mpc @xmath19 comoving size resolved with @xmath20 total particles with an initial mass of @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the gas and dark matter particles , respectively ( simulation s160 ) .",
    "we also analyzed a similar simulation ( s80 ) with @xmath23 particles to test the effects of resolution ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the gas and dark matter particles , respectively ) .",
    "for the s80 experiment , we found similar results to those of s160 supporting the claim that our findings are not strongly affected by numerical resolution ( see nuza et al .",
    "2005 for details on the s80 ) .",
    "the size of the simulated volume has been chosen as a compromise between the need to have a well - represented galaxy sample and high enough numerical resolution to study the astrophysical properties of the simulated galaxies .",
    "certainly , we are representing only galaxies in the field .",
    "a larger volume would be needed to study cluster regions which might contribute more importantly to grbs at high redshift .",
    "however , we would not expect significant changes in our results since the largest differences between the hgs and the general galaxy population are found for @xmath26 , where most of the star formation activity is located outside high density regions ( e.g. martinez & muriel 2006 ) .",
    "however , we note that the small simulated volume makes the comparison with observations more complex since as we move to high redshift , simulated galaxies get smaller as expected in a hierarchical clustering scenario .",
    "hence , at high redshift , the simulated galaxy population differs from the observed samples which tend to select luminous systems ( e.g. christensen et al . 2004 ; fruchter et al .",
    "2006 ) .    de rossi et al . ( 2006 ) constructed the catalogues of simulated galaxies by applying a density contrast criterion ( @xmath27 as in white , efstathiou & frenk 1993 ) to identify virialized structures .",
    "these catalogues include systems with virial mass larger than @xmath28 in order to prevent strong numerical artifacts .",
    "the synthetic catalogues comprises galaxies from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "our numerical resolution prevents us from exploring higher redshifts .",
    "for each simulated galaxy , the dynamical , astrophysical and chemical properties are estimated at the optical radius .",
    "this radius is defined as the one that encloses @xmath31 of the baryonic mass of the systems and provides a more realistic way of confronting simulated galaxies with observed ones . de rossi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) also estimated the synthetic magnitudes for each simulated galaxy by combining the age and metallicity of each star particle in the simulated galaxies and applying the population synthesis model of bruzual & charlot ( 2006 ) .",
    "hence , we will use the dynamical , astrophysical and chemical properties such as optical velocity @xmath32 ) measured at the optical radius .",
    "this velocity is comparable to the rotational velocity measured for galaxies at the maximum observed radius . ] ,",
    "absolute magnitudes and mean o / h abundances for the simulated galaxy sample comprised by 227 , 241 , 202 and 137 objects for @xmath33 respectively with the purpose of studying the properties of the hgs .",
    "a monte carlo code has been designed to work incombination with numerical simulations of a typical region of the universe to generate lgrb events in each of the galaxies in the simulation .",
    "we consider a simulated galaxy with at least one lgrb event as hg .",
    "we assumed poissonian statistics to emulate the probability distribution function of these events .",
    "fwh99 studied several alternatives for the grb progenitors , concluding that the collapsar model was the most likely scenario ( i.e. its expected rate is typically several orders of magnitude greater than for the coalescence - type grb models ) . for this scenario , fwh99 quoted an event rate of @xmath34 myr@xmath13 galaxy@xmath13 , where galaxy represents a typical galaxy . in the collapsar model ,",
    "the progenitor stars are assumed to be massive stars , ending their lives as snib / c .",
    "hence , our lgrb algorithm is designed to select massive stars as grbs candidates which have a short life time . for this purpose , we checked all star particles within two optical radius of a given simulated galaxy , searching for those with a stellar age younger than an adopted stellar - age cut - off , @xmath35 .",
    "the salpeter initial mass function ( see section 2 ) provides the number of massive stars within a given star particle .",
    "therefore , only massive stars younger than @xmath35 are considered as lgrb candidates .",
    "the monte carlo model was tested with several reasonable @xmath35 values within the limits imposed by stellar evolution , being the results insensitive to this parameter . throughout this work",
    ", we assumed @xmath36 yr , @xmath37 myr@xmath13 galaxy@xmath13 and a typical galaxy mass of @xmath38 .",
    "this set of parameters defines model i.    based on the fact that the high metallicity of the progenitor envelope may prevent the triggering of grbs within the collapsar model ( e.g. woosley & hegger 2006 ) , we also developed a model ii which takes into account the metallicity of the progenitor stars .",
    "in fact , in the collapsar model , @xmath39 is the maximum allowed metallicity for the triggering of grbs .",
    "hence , in model ii , only low metallicity , massive stars are considered as possible lgrbs progenitors .",
    "we tested the sensitivity of the results to the adopted metallicity threshold and chose one as the reference value as discussed in next section .",
    "we applied these lgrb models to all simulated galaxies from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "we generated 1000 monte carlo realizations for every selected stellar population ( represented by a given star particle ) in each simulated galaxy of the catalogues for model i and model ii , in order to generate probability distributions for lgrb events .",
    "by applying our lgrb scheme to each of the simulated galaxies as a function of redshift , we generated a distribution of possible lgrb events .",
    "since the lgrb scheme assumes that the progenitors are massive stars , then we expect that the simulated host galaxies of lgrb will reproduce the star formation rate ( sfr ) history of the simulated volume . and",
    "this is actually the case for model i where the predicted hgs agree with the general galaxy population for @xmath40 . for @xmath41",
    ", we found a difference between the @xmath42 determined by the total galaxy population and that traced by hgs in model i. up to @xmath43 of new stars are born in galaxies without lgrbs .",
    "this is a result of statistical fluctuations introduced by the low rates associated to lgrbs given the general decrease of the sf activity in galaxies for @xmath44 .",
    "we found that galaxies at @xmath30 without lgrb events have a sfr distribution with the mean at @xmath45 while hgs have a broader distribution with the mean at @xmath46 .",
    "we acknowledge that part of these effects could be due to the fact that we are not considering sn energy feedback . as a consequence ,",
    "small systems tend to exhaust their gas reservoir too quickly as soon as they collapse , so that their sf activity , later on , is lower than expected .",
    "however , this effect can not explain the trend by itself since galaxies of different virial masses contribute to both sorts of galaxy populations ( i.e. with and without lgrbs ) .    for model",
    "ii , the behavior is different . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the ratio between the comoving star formation rate density ( @xmath42 ) estimated by considering only the selected hgs in model ii and the total @xmath42 obtained from the complete galaxy population . to illustrate the sensitivity of model ii to the adopted metallicity threshold , we included the predicted @xmath42 for model",
    "ii using three metallicity thresholds , corresponding to @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .    evidently , as the restriction in the metallicity increases , the difference between the predicted @xmath42 and the total @xmath42 also increases .",
    "while for a threshold of @xmath47 , our simulations are capable of measuring @xmath50 of the star formation activity in the simulated volume at @xmath41 , this percentage decreases to less than @xmath51 for a lower metallicity threshold .",
    "if the metallicity content of the stars is a key ingredient in the triggering of lgrbs , then tracing the star formation history of the universe by using these events may introduce a biased signal , principally for @xmath44 .",
    "however , at very high redshift , our results suggest that , at the utmost , @xmath52 of the star formation activity could be missing if lgrbs are used as tracers of the star formation activity .",
    "hereafter , we will assume @xmath48 as the reference value for the discussion .",
    "then model ii requires the progenitor star to have a mean abundance 12 + log o / h @xmath53 .",
    "this metallicity threshold corresponds to an o / h level approximately an order of magnitude lower than the solar one given by allende - prieto , lambert & asplund ( 2001 ) . ] and is consistent with the theoretical estimations of yoon , langer & norman ( 2006 ) .",

    "we estimated the simulated mzr for the hgs in model i and model ii as a function of redshift .",
    "we found that both samples follow the general mzr predicted for the simulated galaxy population ( tissera , de rossi & scannapieco 2005 ) . as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , at @xmath30 , only 23 @xmath79 of the hg sample in model ii has a stellar mass larger than the characteristic mass of @xmath80 .",

    "as one moves to higher redshifts , more lgrbs with low metallicity progenitors are produced in larger stellar mass systems . in general , we can say that in our models the lgrbs pick galaxies that trace the general mzr , particularly at @xmath73 .",
    "we note that if the metal content of the lgrb progenitor star is used as a tracer of the mean stellar metallicity of the systems instead of the mean metallicity of the hgs , the dispersion introduced is so large that the mzr is lost . at least in our models ,",
    "the chemical abundance of the progenitor stars are not a good measure of the mean metallicity of the hgs .    .",
    "for clarity , we have not superimposed the general galaxy population which follows the same trends.,width=321 ]",
    "we developed a monte carlo code in order to generate lgrbs adopting the event rate inferred for the collapsar model in fwh99 .",
    "this code works in combination with hydrodynamical cosmological simulations consistent with a @xmath0cdm scenario .",
    "we assumed poissonian statistics for the probability distribution function of the events and adopted a collapsar rate @xmath81 from fwh99 .",
    "two lgrb models have been developed .",
    "model i requires the progenitor star to be a massive one .",
    "this model yields a hg population with similar properties to those of the total simulated galaxy sample .",
    "model ii includes an additional condition on the metallicity of the progenitor star : only low metallicity , massive stars are taken as lgrb candidates , adopting a metallicity threshold an order of magnitude lower than solar as a reference value .",
    "we found that model ii produces a set of hgs with properties in general agreement with observed ones . according to this model ,",
    "hgs tend to be slow rotating systems with high star formation efficiencies , principally at @xmath44 . at higher redshift ,",
    "the correlations get weaker since all galaxies tend to have high star formation efficiencies and larger low - metallicity gaseous reservoirs .",
    "these star formation efficiencies have been estimated by using the stellar mass and the @xmath55-band luminosity .    while at all redshifts there is a trend to have lgrbs in faint , small stellar mass systems with circular velocity smaller than 200 km @xmath82 , for @xmath83 , larger systems can",
    "also significantly contribute .",
    "this is produced by the larger disponibility of low metallicity gas for star formation in systems of all masses at high redshift . according to our results , at @xmath44 , hgs in model",
    "ii would tend to be smaller systems than the general galaxy population while at higher redshift , systems of different morphology and characteristics could be hgs .",
    "these results are in agreement with recent observational findings discussed by conselice et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "we found no tight correlation between the o / h abundance of the lgrb progenitor star and the mean metallicity of the hgs .",
    "however , in model ii the simulated hgs tend to have mean abundances smaller than the solar one since most of the lgrbs are produced in the small , gas - rich systems in agreement with observations .",
    "the low metallicity condition for the progenitor star resulted to be a key ingredient in our model to match the observed properties of hgs at low redshifts ( @xmath84 ) . in model ii ,",
    "the mean metallicity of the hgs are also within the observed values lately reported , although we have some simulated hgs with higher metallicities .",
    "it is also important to note that model ii is able to reproduce the main characteristics of the observed hg of lgrbs without getting contradiction with theoretical models for lgrbs which require metallicities smaller than @xmath85 solar .    the estimation of the mzr for hgs shows that in model ii , these systems are also good tracers of the galaxy mzr , although at @xmath26 this model tends to map better the low mass end . in general",
    "we found that hgs do not differ significantly from the general galaxy population although the probability to have a lgrb event is higher in galaxies with larger star formation activity and in faint systems ( since they are also more abundant and have more metal - poor gas ) . in our simulations ,",
    "the mzr is determined by the transformation of gas into stars which is mainly regulated by the assemble of the structure ( de rossi et al .",
    "2006 ) and its continuous enrichment by previous stellar generations .",
    "since no sn winds have been modeled in this work , we can not study their effect on the hgs relations .",
    "it is expected that sn winds might modify the distribution of chemical elements in galaxies , preferentially in low mass systems ( e.g larson 1974 ) where powerful , metal - loaded winds can develop ( scannapieco et al .",
    "however , we do not expect that this process would significantly modify our results , since slow rotating systems have , nevertheless , low metallicity .",
    "for this reason , we actually expect the predicted trends to be even stronger when including sn energy feedback since this process will help to regulate the transformation of gas into stars and will also eject part of the metals into the intergalactic media preferentially for slow rotating systems . although it will be interesting to study the effects of sn energy feedback in our results in the future , it is encouraging that this simple scheme for lgbrs , consistently included within a cosmological simulation , can already reproduce general trends of observed hgs .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for useful comments which helped to improve this paper significantly .",
