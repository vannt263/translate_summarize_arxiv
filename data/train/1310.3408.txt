    "although it has been known since the work of jacob and monod that genomes encode special regulatory sequences in the form of binding sites for proteins that modulate transcription , only recently has it become clear that genomes encode other regulatory features in their sequences as well .",
    "further , with the advent of modern sequencing methods , it is of great interest to have a base - pair resolution understanding of the significance of the entirety of genomes , not just specific coding regions and putative regulatory sites .",
    "one well - known example of other information present in genomes is the different sequence preferences that confer nucleosome positioning @xcite , with similar ideas at least partially relevant in the context of architectural proteins in bacteria also @xcite .",
    "it has been shown both from analyses of sequences isolated from natural sources and from _ in vitro _",
    "nucleosome affinity studies with synthetic sequences that the dna sequence can cause the relative affinity of nucleosomes for dna to vary over several orders of magnitude , most likely due to the intrinsic flexibility , especially bendability , of the particular dna sequence in question @xcite . the claim that intrinsic dna sequence flexibility determines nucleosome affinity has led not only to many theoretical and experimental studies on the relationship between sequence and flexibility @xcite , but also to the elucidation of numerous sequence `` rules '' that can be used to predict the likelihood that a nucleosome will prefer certain sequences over others ( summarized recently in @xcite ) .",
    "for example ,",
    "aa / tt / at / ta steps in phase with the helical repeat of the dna , with gg / cc / cg / gc steps five base pairs out of phase with the aa / tt / at / ta steps , are a common motif in both naturally occurring and synthetic nucleosome - preferring sequences @xcite .",
    "similarly , the g+c content of a sequence and occurrence of poly(da : dt ) tracts have been very powerful parameters in predicting nucleosome occupancy _ in vivo _ @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to explore the extent to which these sequences , when taken beyond the context of cyclization and nucleosome formation to another critical dna deformation motif , exhibit similar effects on a distinct kind of deformation .",
    "there has been an especially long history of the study of these intriguing sequence motifs known as poly(da : dt ) tracts , in the context of nucleosome occupancy as well as many other biological contexts . such sequences , composed of 4 or more a bases in a row ( @xmath0 with @xmath1 ) or two or more a bases followed by an equal number of t bases ( @xmath2 with @xmath3 ) , strongly disfavor nucleosome formation , both _ in vivo _ @xcite and _ in vitro _",
    "@xcite , and are in fact thought to be one of the primary determinants of nucleosome positions _ in vivo _",
    "@xcite , with their presence upstream of promoters and in the downstream genes correlating with increased gene expression levels @xcite .",
    "poly(da : dt ) tracts show unique structural and dynamic properties in a variety of _ in vitro _ and _ in vivo _ assays ( summarized recently in @xcite ) , with one of their hallmark characteristics being a marked intrinsic curvature @xcite .",
    "there is evidence that poly(da : dt ) tracts may also be less flexible than other sequences @xcite , which is often given as the reason for their low affinity for nucleosomes , though there is some evidence that poly(da : dt ) tracts might actually be _ more _ flexible than other sequences @xcite .",
    "it is clear , however , that some special property or properties of a - tracts leads them to be especially resistant to the deformations that are required for dna wrapped in a nucleosome @xcite , and , indeed , to their important functions in several other biological contexts as well @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we make use of sequences that , in the context of nucleosome formation and cyclization assays , appear to be associated with distinct flexibilities as a starting point for examining the question of what sequence rules control deformations induced by a dna - loop - forming transcription factor , as opposed to those induced in nucleosomes .",
    "we have previously argued using two synthetic sequences that dna looping does not necessarily follow the same sequence - dependent trends as do nucleosome formation and cyclization @xcite . here",
    "we expand our repertoire of sequences to specifically test the generalizability of three sequence features known to be important in nucleosome biology and cyclization .",
    "we focus in particular on the intriguing class of nucleosome - repelling , poly(da : dt)-rich dnas that are thought to be especially resistant to deformation , making use of a naturally occurring poly(da : dt)-rich sequence that forms a nucleosome - free region at a yeast promoter @xcite .",
    "we note that the poly(da : dt)-rich dna we use here differs from the _ phased _ a - tracts that have been extensively characterized in the context of dna looping , both _ in vivo _ and _ in vitro _ @xcite . phased",
    "a - tracts contain short poly(da : dt ) tracts spaced by non - a - tract dnas such that the poly(da : dt ) tracts are in phase with the helical period of the dna , generating globally curved structures that are known to significantly enhance dna looping @xcite .",
    "the poly(da : dt)-rich sequence we examine here contains _",
    "unphased _ a - tracts that we do not anticipate to have a sustained , global curvature .",
    "we compare the effects on looping of this poly(da : dt)-rich dna not only to the effects of two synthetic sequences we have previously studied , but also to those of two additional naturally occurring , genomic sequences : the well - known , strong nucleosome positioning sequence 5s from a sea urchin ribosomal subunit @xcite , which , along with the 601ta sequence we previously studied , contains the repeating aa / tt / ta / at and offset gg / cc / cg / gc steps that are common in nucleosome - preferring sequences ; and one of the gc - rich sequences that are abundant in the exons and regulatory regions ( _ e.g. _ promoters ) of human genes , and that correlate with high nucleosome occupancy _ in vivo _ @xcite . the 5s sequence has been examined using both _ in vitro _",
    "cyclization and _ in vitro _ nucleosome formation assays and , along with the two synthetic sequences e8 and 601ta @xcite , can be used as a standard for comparison between our and other _ in vitro _ assays .",

    "two - letter abbreviations given in parentheses under each full sequence name will be used in figure legends in the rest of this work .    to measure the effect of these sequences on looping rather than nucleosome formation , we made use of a combination of an _ in vitro _",
    "single - molecule assay for dna looping , called tethered particle motion ( tpm ) @xcite , with the canonical _ e. coli _ lac repressor to induce looping , and a statistical mechanical model for looping that allows us to extract a quantitative measure of dna flexibility , called the looping j - factor , for the dna in the loop @xcite .",
    "we have recently demonstrated @xcite that this combined method offers a powerful and complementary approach to established assays that have been used to probe the mechanical properties of dna , particularly at short length scales , to great effect , such as ligase - mediated dna cyclization @xcite and measured dna end - to - end distance by fluorescence resonance energy transfer @xcite . in particular , using the lac repressor as a tool to probe the role of dna deformability in loop formation allows us to examine the effect of sequence on the formation of shapes other than the roughly circular ones formed by cyclization and nucleosome formation , which we have argued may be an important caveat to discovering general flexibility rules from nucleosome formation and cyclization studies alone @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find that the poly(da : dt)-rich sequence that strongly excludes nucleosomes _ in vivo _ @xcite and that belongs to a class of sequences usually thought of as highly resistant to deformation is in fact the strongest looping sequence we have studied so far . moreover , the 5s and ta sequences , which share sequence features important to nucleosome formation ( see figures  [ fig : siseqlist1 ] and  [ fig : siseqlist2 ] in file s1 and ref .",

    "we also find that g+c content , a good predictor of nucleosome occupancy , is not likewise positively correlated with looping , and in fact our data suggest the g+c content and looping may be _",
    "_ anti__correlated .",
    "taken together , these results strongly suggest that very different sequence rules determine dna looping versus cyclization and nucleosome formation , possibly because of the protein - mediated boundary conditions that differ between looping geometries and nucleosomal geometries , and that the biophysical characteristics of poly(da : dt)-rich dnas and their biological functions may be more diverse and context - dependent than has been previously appreciated .",

    "we use the canonical lac repressor from _",

    "because more readily deformable sequences allow loops to form more easily , we can quantify sequence - dependent dna flexibility by quantifying the looping probability , which we calculate as the time spent in the looped state divided by the total observation time ( see methods for details ) .",
    "more precisely , our statistical mechanical model ( described in the methods section ) allows us to extract a parameter called the looping j - factor from looping probabilities @xcite .",
    "the j - factor is the effective concentration of one end of the loop in the vicinity of the other , analogous to the j - factor measured in ligase - mediated dna cyclization assays @xcite , and is mathematically related to the energy required to deform the dna into a loop , @xmath4 , according to the relationship : @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being boltzmann s constant and @xmath8 the temperature ) .",

    "however , in the case of dna looping by the lac repressor , where the boundary conditions are not well known ( summarized in fig . 4 of @xcite ) , an expression for the looping j - factor in terms of the twist and bend flexibility parameters of the loop dna has not been described . nevertheless , by measuring the j - factors for different sequences , we can comparatively assess the effect of sequence on the energy required to deform the dna into a loop , and thereby gain insight into the sequence rules that control this deformation .",
    "given that 5s and ta share both sequence features and similar trends in apparent flexibility in the contexts of nucleosome formation and cyclization @xcite , we expected these two sequences to behave similarly to each other in the context of looping . on the other hand , since poly(da : dt)-rich sequences are supposed to assume such unique structures as to strongly disfavor nucleosome formation @xcite , while high gc content is one of the strongest predictors of high nucleosome occupancy @xcite , we expected these two sequences to behave very differently from each other in the context of looping . given the common assumption that poly(da : dt)-rich dnas are highly resistant to deformation , we especially did not expect to observe much , if any , loop formation with the poly(da : dt)-rich , nucleosome - repelling sequence .",

    "[ fig : plooptot ] , none of these expectations were borne out .",

    ", the behavior of these special nucleosome - preferring or nucleosome - repelling sequences is dependent on the larger dna context , in that the addition of the 36-bp bacterial _",

    "[ fig : plooptot](c ) ) , the two synthetic sequences , e8 and ta , exhibit comparable amounts of looping , while the three natural sequences , including both 5s and poly(da : dt ) , all loop more than either e8 or ta . with the promoter ( fig  [ fig : plooptot](d ) ) , however , ta loops more than e8 , but 5s _ less _ than either e8 or ta . both with and without the promoter",

    "the looping probabilities of the poly(da : dt ) sequence are especially surprising  instead of looping very little , as we expected , this sequence loops more than any other sequence without the promoter and a comparable amount to ta with the promoter .",
    "these five sequences differ not only in looping probability , but also in the loop length at which that looping is maximal : the poly(da : dt ) sequence is maximized at 104  bp , the 5s and cg sequences at 105  bp , and the e8 and ta sequences at 106  bp .",
    "these different maxima could be explained by different helical periods for these five dnas , though without more periods of data we can not definitively quantify their helical periods . in the case of the poly(da : dt ) sequence , an altered helical period would not be unexpected , as pure poly(da : dt ) copolymers are known to have shorter helical periods ( 10.1 bp / turn ) than random dnas ( 10.6 bp / turn ) @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", 5s exhibits the same helical period as e8 and ta in cyclization assays @xcite , so it is intriguing that its looping maximum occurs at a different length than that of e8 and ta , perhaps suggesting a different helical period in the context of looping than that of e8 and ta .",
    "the promoter does not appear to alter the maximum of looping for a given sequence .",
    "as noted above , it is difficult to use these looping data to comment further on other dna elasticity parameters , in particular any sequence - dependent differences in torsional stiffness , but in fig .",
    "[ fig : sitwiststiffness ] in file s1 we provide evidence that these sequences may share the same twisting flexibility , even if they differ in helical period .     as described in the methods section .",
    "the j - factor is a measure of the free energy of loop formation ( and is related to the bending and twisting flexibility of the dna in the loop ) : the higher the j - factor , the lower the free energy required to deform the loop region dna into a loop . as described in @xcite",
    ", the addition of the promoter to the e8 loop sequence does not significantly affect its j - factor , so the j - factor for e8 with the promoter is shown as a reference in all panels ( black open points ) .",
    "in contrast to e8 , the addition of the promoter does change the j - factors for three of the four other sequences , making the ta - containing loops more flexible , but the 5s and , to a lesser extent , cg sequences less flexible .",
    "interestingly , the poly(da : dt ) sequence , like the e8 sequence , is unchanged with the inclusion of the promoter .",
    "we note that because the no - promoter versus with - promoter constructs contain different combinations of repressor binding sites , we can only use j - factors , not looping probabilities , to quantitatively examine the effect of the promoter ; the statistical mechanical model of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : ploop ] allows us to make this comparison.,width=576 ]    the effect of the promoter on loop formation can be more clearly seen when looping j - factors are compared across sequences , instead of the looping probabilities . because the no - promoter and with - promoter loops are flanked by different combinations of operators ( fig .",
    "[ fig : plooptot](b ) ; see also methods ) , their looping probabilities can not be directly compared . however , as described above and in the methods section , we can use the statistical mechanical model that we have described for this system to extract j - factors from each looping probability @xcite .",
    "these j - factors are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jloop ] .",
    "loop sequence can modulate the looping j - factor by at least an order of magnitude ( compare the poly(da : dt ) j - factors to those of 5s with promoter or e8 and ta , no - promoter ) .",
    "the _ _ lac__uv5 promoter has the largest effect on the ta and 5s sequences ( though of opposite sign ) , but appears to have little effect on poly(da : dt)-containing and e8-containing loops , and moderate effect on cg - containing loops .",
    "it is intriguing how large and diverse an effect the 36-bp _ _",
    "lac__uv5 promoter has on the roughly 100 bp loops we examine here ; but one possible explanation for its minimal effect on the poly(da : dt)-rich sequence , at least , compared to the others , is that the properties of a - tract structures tend to dominate over the properties of surrounding sequences @xcite .",
    "we note that our results in @xcite comparing the effect of sequence versus flanking operators on measured j - factors preclude the possibility that the differences between the no - promoter and with - promoter constructs are due to the difference in flanking operators .",
    "we also note that it is possible that the effect of the promoter stems not from the promoter sequence itself , but from the fact that the sequences of interest that form the rest of the loop are shorter when 36 bp of the loop are replaced by the promoter sequence .",
    "however , we consider this explanation to be less likely , because as shown in the left - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : plooptot](c ) and ( d ) above , we have measured the looping probabilities ( and j - factors ; see @xcite ) of more than two periods of e8- and ta - containing dnas , allowing a direct comparison of loops that contain the same amount of e8 and ta both with and without the promoter ( compare , for example , no - promoter loop lengths of 90 bp to with - promoter lengths of 120 bp ) . in this case",
    "we still find that without the promoter the j - factors of the e8- and ta - containing loops are indistinguishable , but with the promoter the ta sequence loops more than the e8 sequence , indicating that it is the promoter and not a shortening of some unique element(s ) of the e8 or ta sequences that cause the difference in j - factors with versus without the promoter for these two sequences .",
    "tpm trajectories not only provide information about the free energy of loop formation , captured by the j - factors discussed in the previous section , but also contain some information about the preferred loop conformation as a function of sequence , through the observed length of the tpm tether when a loop has formed .",
    "in fact , previous work from our group and others has shown that the lac repressor can support at least two observable loop conformations for any pair of operators , with any sequence , because these conformations lead to distinct tether lengths in tpm @xcite .",
    "although the underlying molecular details of these two looped states , which we label the `` middle '' ( `` m '' ) and `` bottom '' ( `` b '' ) states according to their tether lengths relative to the unlooped state , are as yet unknown , they must differ in repressor and/or dna conformation in a way that alters the boundary conditions of the loop , since they are distinguishable in tpm .",
    "it has been proposed that the two states arise from the four distinct dna binding topologies allowed by a v - shaped lac repressor similar to that shown in the lac repressor crystal structure @xcite , and/or two repressor conformations , the v - shape seen in the crystal structure and a more extended `` e '' shape @xcite .",
    "it is likely , in fact , that the two observed looped states are each composed of more than one microstate ( that is , some combination of v - shaped and e - shaped repressor conformation(s ) and associated binding topologies @xcite ) . even without knowing the details of the underlying molecular conformation(s ) of these two states , however",
    ", we can use them to provide a window into the effect of sequence on preferred loop conformation .    in particular , by examining the relative probability of the two looped states as a function of both loop length and loop sequence",
    ", we can assess the contributions of sequence to the energy required to form the associated loop conformation(s ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : ploopbvsm ] , which of the two looped states predominates depends in a complicated way upon the loop sequence , the presence versus absence of the _ _ lac__uv5 promoter , and the loop length . in @xcite , we showed that having e8 or ta in the loop region , over two to three helical periods , leads to alternating preferences for the middle versus the bottom looped state , with the middle state predominating when the operators are in - phase and looping is maximal , but the bottom state predominating when the operators are out - of - phase .",

    "the preferred state of the cg sequence is mostly insensitive to the presence versus absence of the promoter . both with and without the promoter ,",

    "however , the trend seen in the preceding section with cg and poly(da : dt ) having more in common than 5s and ta holds true for preferred loop conformation as well .",

    "further computational and modeling efforts will be required to relate these data on tether lengths and preferred loop length to loop structure , similarly to how towles and coworkers have used tpm tether lengths to show that different dna loop topologies can explain the observed tethered lengths of the two looped states @xcite . however , even without currently knowing the underlying molecular details causing these sequence - specific trends in tether length and preferred loop state , and therefore in loop conformation , it is clear that it is the loop sequence , and not the lac repressor itself , that determines the loop conformation to a large degree .",
    "it has been shown recently that the lac repressor is capable of accommodating many different loop conformations @xcite , which is consistent with the results we present here .",
    "we hope that computational and modeling efforts with these data , as well as continued efforts to use assays such as fret to directly probe loop conformation @xcite , will shed light on this complex interplay between sequence and loop conformation .",
    "in @xcite we showed that the synthetic e8 and ta sequences show no sequence dependence to looping in the absence of the _",
    "_ lac__uv5 promoter but a nucleosome - like sequence dependence in the presence of the promoter .",
    "we hypothesized that perhaps the promoter alters the preferred state of the loop to one whose shape is more similar to that of dna in a nucleosome or dna minicircle formed by cyclization , leading to similar sequence trends with the promoter as with nucleosomes .",
    "we still attribute the difference in the patterns of sequence dependence that we observe between looping and nucleosome formation to the role of the shape of the deformation in determining the observed deformability of a particular sequence .",
    "however , we have shown here with a broader range of sequences that the role of the promoter in controlling loopability is more complicated than we had previously hypothesized .",
    "neither with nor without the promoter does loop formation follow the sequence trends of nucleosome formation . as shown in figure  [ fig : comparecycloop ] , if looping j - factors did follow the same patterns of sequence preference as do cyclization j - factors and nucleosome formation free energies , a plot of the looping j - factors versus cyclization j - factors for the various sequences we have studied here would fall on a line with a positive slope .",
    "we find that this is not the case ; in fact , without the promoter there is perhaps a slight anticorrelation between looping j - factors and cyclization j - factors ( and no discernible correlation with the promoter ) .    )",

    "cloutier and widom used this correlation to argue that the same mechanical properties , particularly the bendability , of the dna contributed to nucleosome formation as to cyclization @xcite .",
    "the energy of cyclization , @xmath13 , is related to the cyclization j - factor for a particular dna , @xmath14 , through the relationship @xmath15 , where @xmath8 is the temperature , @xmath16 is the gas constant and @xmath17 is an arbitrary reference molecule ( see ref .",

    "the cyclization j - factors of the poly(da : dt)-rich and gc - rich sequences that we use here have not been reported , so they are shown as shaded regions whose height reflects the uncertainty in the looping j - factors we measure , and whose width reflect our estimates about what their cyclization behavior should be .",
    "in particular , the poly(da : dt)-rich sequence exhibits very low nucleosome occupancy _ in vivo _",
    "@xcite , and similar sequences have high energies of nucleosome formation _ in vitro _",
    "@xcite , which , according to the logic of ( a ) , should correspond to a low cyclization j - factor , probably lower than that of e8 .",
    "some poly(da : dt)-rich dnas were in fact recently directly shown to cyclize less readily than random sequences @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the gc - rich sequence should be a good nucleosome former ( though the nucleosome affinity of this particular sequence has not been tested either _ in vivo _ or _ in vitro _ ) , and so its cyclization j - factor is probably comparable to that of 5s and ta , the other strong nucleosome - preferring sequences on this plot .",
    "additional details of how this plot was generated can be found in the methods section.,width=576 ]    the strong correlation between a sequence s ease of cyclization and of nucleosome formation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparecycloop](a ) , has been used to argue that nucleosome sequence preferences depend largely on the intrinsic mechanical properties of a dna , particularly its bendability @xcite , though other mechanisms have also been proposed , such as that described by rohs and coworkers , which depends not on sequence - dependent dna flexibility but on sequence - dependent minor groove shape @xcite .",
    "we have shown here that three sequence features that commonly determine nucleosome preferences , either through their effect on dna flexibility or on other structural aspects recognized by the nucleosome , do not likewise determine looping , arguing for the need to identify a different set of sequence features that determine loopability .",
    "the most striking contrast between previously established sequence `` rules '' derived from nucleosome studies and the trends in looping j - factors that we observe here is that of the nucleosome - repelling , poly(da : dt ) sequence , which has the lowest looping free energy that we have quantified so far .",
    "other _ in vitro _ assays predominantly show poly(da : dt ) copolymers to be highly resistant to deformations ; for example , vafabakhsh and coworkers recently used a fret - based cyclization assay , analogous to traditional ligase - mediated cyclization assays , to show that poly(da : dt)-rich sequences have cyclization rates significantly smaller than other sequences such as e8 and ta @xcite .",
    "although ease of cyclization is often equated with bendability , it appears that such observed bendability is more context - dependent than has been previously appreciated : that is , the simplest model that one would write down to describe the energetics of these different deformed dnas would feature the persistence length as the governing parameter that is used to characterize bendability , and yet , the distinct responses seen in looping , nucleosomes and cyclization belie that simplest model",
    ". it will be informative to extend this study of an unphased poly(da : dt ) tract in dna loops to include more sequences containing both pure poly(da : dt ) copolymers and naturally - occuring poly(da : dt)-rich dnas that exclude nucleosomes _ in vivo _ , in order to elucidate the precise role of poly(da : dt)-tracts in determining looping .",
    "it is clear , however , that poly(da : dt)-rich dnas should not be exclusively thought of as stiff or resistant to bending in all biological contexts .",
    ".,width=288 ]    a second striking contrast between our results here and previously established rules for nucleosome formation concerns the role of g+c content in determining loop formation .",
    "the g+c content of a dna is one of the most powerful parameters for predicting nucleosome occupancy _ in vivo _",
    "@xcite , with higher g+c content correlating with higher occupancy .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gccontent ] , g+c content offers little predictive power for loopability , or is anticorrelated with looping .",
    "we note that a recent , systematic dna cyclization study demonstrated a quadratic dependence of dna bending stiffness on g+c content @xcite . in our case of protein - mediated dna looping",
    ", the looping j - factor contains contributions from protein elasticity in addition to those from dna elasticity , and our dna sequences contain a - tracts and gggccc motifs that were excluded in @xcite , making a direct comparison between our results and theirs difficult ; but it is possible that the looping j - factor is neither correlated or anticorrelated with g+c content but instead depends quadratically on g+c content , as do cyclization j - factors .",
    "more data will be necessary to make a strong statistical statement about the anticorrelation or lack of correlation between the looping j - factor and g+c content , and to determine the form of the relationship between the looping j - factor and g+c content ( _ e.g. _ quadratic versus linear ) , but we propose low g+c content as the starting point of a potential new sequence `` rule '' for predicting looping j - factors , and a fertile realm of further investigation .",
    "finally , we have shown that the repeating aa / tt / ta / at and gg / cc / gc / cg steps that characterize the 5s and ta sequences , as well as many nucleosome - preferring sequences , do not likewise determine looping j - factors , as these two sequences behave very differently from each other in the context of transcription factor - mediated dna looping .",
    "here we have extended our previous work on the sequence dependence of loop formation by the lac repressor to include three naturally occurring , genomic sequences that have either nucleosome - repelling or nucleosome - attracting functions _ in vivo _ , in addition to the two synthetic sequences we described previously @xcite .",
    "we find that two sequences that share sequence features important to nucleosome formation and that share trends in observed flexibility in cyclization and nucleosome formation assays , the 601ta and 5s sequences , behave less similarly in the context of dna looping than the two sequences that should have least in common , the gc - rich , nucleosome attracting sequence and the poly(da : dt)-rich , nucleosome repelling sequence . 5s and ta share neither trends in looping free energy relative to the random e8 sequence , nor loop length where looping is maximal , nor preferred loop conformation , nor their response to the larger sequence context ( as evidenced by the fact that the inclusion of the _ _ lac__uv5 promoter sequence in the loop increases the looping j - factor for ta but decreases it for 5s ) .",
    "we have also shown that a poly(da : dt)-rich dna that forms a nucleosome - free region in yeast @xcite is actually extremely deformable in the context of looping by a transcription factor .",
    "the rest of the sequences show a range of j - factors that does not correlate with any observed trends in flexibility as measured by ligase - mediated cyclization assays , nor with the observation that high g+c content correlates with nucleosome occupancy @xcite .",
    "the diversity of the effects on dna looping that we observe with these five sequences ( ten , if the inclusion of the promoter is considered to create a `` new '' sequence ) underscores the necessity of a large - scale screen for sequences that control loop formation both _ in vivo _ and _ in vitro _",
    ", much as has been done in the context of nucleosome formation to help establish the sequence - dependence rules of that field ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "our work in no way undermines previous claims of the sequence dependence to nucleosome formation and/or occupancy either _ in vivo _ or _ in vitro _ ; rather , it demonstrates that the `` rules '' of sequence flexibility derived from cyclization and nucleosome formation studies are inapplicable to dna looping , possibly due to the difference in the boundary conditions and therefore dna conformations involved in forming a protein - mediated loop versus a dna minicircle or a nucleosome",
    ". it will be interesting to extend these studies of the role of sequence in loop formation to other dna looping proteins besides the lac repressor .",
    "as noted above , it has been shown recently that the lac repressor can accommodate many different loop conformations @xcite .",
    "the variety in tether lengths and preferred looped states that we observe are consistent with a forgiving lac repressor protein .",
    "nucleosomes , on the other hand , have a more fixed structure that should not be as accommodating to a range of helical periods and dna polymer conformations ( hence the hypothesis that poly(da : dt)-rich dnas disfavor nucleosome formation because they adopt geometry that is incompatible with the structure of the dna in a nucleosome @xcite )",
    ". it would be informative to measure the looping j - factors of these same sequences with a more rigid looping protein .",
    "it will also be interesting to see if other bacterial promoter sequences have similar effect of altering the looping boundary condition as the very strong and synthetic _",
    "_ lac__uv5 promoter .",
    "in fact , the _ _ lac__uv5 promoter should be a key starting point for identifying sequences that have a strong effect on looping , since it can have significant effects on the behavior of a loop , even when it comprises only one - third of the loop length .",

    "cloning of the sequences of interest into the pzs25 plasmid was accomplished in either one or two steps . for the 5s sequences ,",
    "oligomers were first ordered from integrated dna technologies as single - stranded forward and reverse complements , consisting of 69 bp ( for the `` with - promoter '' constructs ) or 105 bp ( for the `` no - promoter '' constructs ) of the 5s sequence , plus the @xmath18 and @xmath19/@xmath20 operators , and , where applicable , the _ _ lac__uv5 promoter sequence .",
    "these oligomers were annealed and then ligated into the pzs25 plasmid at the aatii and ecori restriction sites that fall just outside the operators that flank the e8 or ta sequences in the original pzs25 plasmids @xcite .",
    "second , quik - change mutagenesis ( agilent technologies ) was performed to generate additional lengths ( that is , to introduce insertions or deletions ) of the 5s sequence from the initial 105 bp loop lengths .",
    "however , we found that this site - directed mutagenesis step generated distributions of products for the poly(da : dt ) constructs , possibly due to replication slipped mispairing over repetitive sequences @xcite .",
    "therefore all lengths of the poly(da : dt ) sequence , as well as of the gc - rich sequence , which also have the potential to contain such `` slippery '' regions , were created by ligation of synthesized oligomers into the pzs25 plasmid .",
    "all constructs were confirmed by sequencing ( laragen inc . ) to have clean sequence reads , and the approximately 450  bp digoxigenin- and biotin - labeled tpm constructs were created by pcr as described for the e8- and ta - containing constructs in @xcite .",
    "sequences of tpm constructs were again confirmed by sequencing before use .",
    "tethered particle motion assays were performed as described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , linear dnas , labeled on one end with digoxigenin and on the other end with biotin , were introduced into chambers created between a microscope slide and coverslip , with the coverslip coated nonspecifically with anti - digoxigenin .",
    "streptavidin - coated beads ( bangs laboratories , inc ) were then introduced into the chamber to complete the formation of tethered particles .",
    "the motion of the beads was tracked using custom matlab code that calculated each bead s root - mean - squared ( rms ) motion in the plane of the coverslip , and looping probabilities were extracted from these rms - versus - time trajectories as the time spent in the looped state ( reduced rms ) , divided by total observation time .",
    "similarly , the probabilities of the `` bottom '' versus `` middle '' states ( see results section ) were defined as the time spent in a particular state , divided by the total observation time .    by measuring the looping probability of a construct at a particular repressor concentration , and using the repressor - operator dissociation constants for @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath18 in @xcite",
    ", we can calculate the j - factor for that construct .",
    "all measurements in this work were carried out at 100 pm repressor , using repressor purified in - house .",

    "a similar expression can be derived for the j - factors of the individual `` bottom '' and `` middle '' looped states and is given in @xcite .",
    "the j - factors plotted in figure  [ fig : comparecycloop ] are the maximum looping or cyclization j - factors over a particular period . specifically , the looping j - factors used are those at 104 bp for da , 105 for 5s and cg , and 106 for e8 and ta ; the cyclization j - factors are for 94 bp of the e8 , 5s or ta sequences and are taken from @xcite .",
    "although we are not directly comparing identical lengths between cyclization and looping , the general trends hold regardless of lengths chosen .",
    "in fact , identifying the loop length that corresponds to a particular cyclization length is difficult , given that the flanking operators for looping must be taken into account in some fashion .",
    "that is , for cyclization , dna length is easy to compute  it is simply the length of the oligomer used in the ligation reactions .",
    "however , in the case of looping , it is unclear if the appropriate length for comparison is just the dna in the loop ( excluding the operators ) , or the length between the midpoints of the operators , or including all of the operators .",
    "similarly , we are not comparing identical loop lengths across sequences ; we chose to compare loop flexibility at the looping maximum for each sequence in an attempt to compare lengths at which the operators are most likely to be in phase , such that we are comparing only bending and not twisting flexibility . finally , we note that here we are interested in the same kind of comparison that cloutier and widom were in ref .",
