    "it is one of the most important tasks of future collider experiments to unravel in detail the mechanism of mass generation and electroweak symmetry breaking . within the standard model of particle physics ( sm )",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking is achieved by the higgs mechanism which postulates the existence of an electrically neutral scalar field that interacts with all sm particles carrying non - zero hypercharge and weak isospin .",
    "the particle masses are then generated by the higgs field vacuum expectation value @xmath1  gev , @xmath2 being the fermi constant , that arises through the higgs self interactions .",
    "the mechanism also predicts that the higgs field can be manifest as a massive , elementary , scalar bose particle that can be produced in collider experiments .",
    "the mass of the higgs boson is expected to lie between the current lower experimental limit of @xmath3  gev  @xcite and about @xmath4  tev .",
    "current analyses of electroweak precision observables yield a @xmath5 cl upper bound of @xmath6  gev for the higgs boson mass  @xcite .",
    "while a higgs boson with a mass smaller than @xmath4  tev can be found at the lhc , precise and model - independent measurements of its quantum numbers and couplings can be gained from the @xmath7 linear collider  @xcite .",
    "an important prediction of the higgs mechanism is that its yukawa couplings to quarks @xmath8 are related to the quark masses by @xmath9 .",
    "this makes the measurement of the yukawa coupling to the top quark particularly important since it can be expected that it will be determined with the highest precision among the yukawa couplings , either through direct or indirect methods . at the @xmath7 linear collider",
    "the top quark yukawa coupling can be measured from top quark pair production associated with a higgs boson , @xmath0 .",
    "this process is particulary suited for a light higgs boson since the cross section is then large and the rate is dominated by the amplitudes describing higgs radiation off the top or the antitop quark .",
    "assuming an experimental precision at the percent level , qcd and electroweak radiative corrections need to be accounted for in the theoretical predictions .    approximating the top quark and the higgs boson as stable particles the born cross section was already determined some time ago in refs .",

    "the @xmath10 qcd one - loop corrections a number of references in various approximations exist .",
    "an analysis for large energy and small higgs masses can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , while a full computation of the numerically dominant virtual photon exchange contributions , where the higgs is radiated exclusively from the top and antitop quark , was presented in ref .",
    "finally , the full set of qcd corrections was given in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , the full set of one - loop electroweak corrections was obtained in refs .",

    "0.0 cm    a particularly interesting kinematical phase space region is where the energy of the higgs boson is large and close to its kinematic end point . in this end point region",
    "the @xmath12 pair is forced to become collinear and to fly opposite to the higgs direction in order to maximize the momentum necessary to balance for the large higgs momentum , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for an illustration .",
    "the general relation between the higgs energy @xmath13 and the @xmath12 invariant mass @xmath14 reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the c.m.energy and @xmath17 the higgs boson mass .",
    "thus for large @xmath13 the @xmath12 invariant mass approaches @xmath18 and the top quark pair is nonrelativistic in its center - of - mass system . since",
    "a light higgs boson having a mass below the @xmath19 threshold is quite narrow  gev one finds @xmath20  gev  @xcite . ] and the hadronic higgs decay final state factorizes to a very good approximation , the strong interactions between the @xmath12 pair and the hadronic higgs final state can be neglected .",
    "therefore , close to the higgs energy end point , the @xmath12 qcd dynamics is exclusively governed by the nonrelativistic physics known from the process @xmath21 in the @xmath12 threshold region at @xmath22  @xcite .    in this regime the so - called coulomb singularities @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being the top quark relative velocity in the @xmath12 c.m.frame ,",
    "arise in the amplitudes and render the perturbative expansion in the number of loops inapplicable .",
    "this singularity structure is most easily visible in the higgs energy distribution , @xmath25 .",
    "while the born distribution approaches zero for @xmath26 , @xmath27  @xcite , the @xmath10 fixed - order perturbative corrections are proportional to @xmath28 at the end point  @xcite and the @xmath29 corrections even diverge like @xmath30 . in principle , the problem can be avoided by imposing a cut on the higgs energy ( or the @xmath12 invariant mass @xmath31 ) , but such a measure is unnecessary because there exists an elaborate technology from the threshold region in the process @xmath32",
    "@xcite , that allows to sum the coulomb singularities to all orders in @xmath28 and to carry out a simultaneous expansion in @xmath28 and @xmath33 using a nonrelativistic effective theory .",
    "imposing a cut is also disadvantageous since the nonrelativistic portion of the @xmath34 phase space increases for smaller c.m.energies or larger higgs masses . due to the large top quark sm width @xmath35  gev , which serves as an infrared cutoff ,",
    "the corresponding qcd effective theory computations can be carried out with perturbative methods for all higgs energies in the end point region .",
    "the effective theory also allows for a systematic summation of logarithmic terms @xmath36 to all orders in @xmath28 using the velocity renormalization group  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we compute the higgs energy distribution @xmath37 in the large higgs energy end point region at leading - logarithmic ( ll ) and next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nll ) order in the nonrelativistic expansion in the framework of `` velocity '' nonrelativistic qcd ( vnrqcd ) using the conventions and notations of refs .",

    "this behavior is well known from the predictions for @xmath21 at threshold  @xcite and originates from the structure of the large negative @xmath10 qcd corrections to the coulomb potential , eq.([vcoulomb ] ) , and from the sizable negative qcd corrections to the matching conditions in eq.([matchcond ] ) .    in principle",
    "this behavior is a point of concern because it could indicate that the renormalization parameter variation might be an inadequate method to estimate theoretical uncertainties .",
    "fortunately , the top quark mass is sufficiently large such that the regions where the conventional fixed - order expansion ( in powers of the strong coupling ) and where the nonrelativistic expansion ( described by the effective theory ) can be applied are expected to overlap . in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] the higgs energy spectrum is displayed in the fixed - order expansion at the born ( dashed lines ) and the @xmath10 level ( solid lines ) and in the nonrelativistic expansion at ll ( dotted lines ) and nll order ( solid lines ) .",

    "the born curves were obtained from the analytic results given in ref.@xcite a factor @xmath140 is missing for the term @xmath141 . in the coefficient functions @xmath142 and @xmath143 an overall factor of minus one is missing . ] and the @xmath10 curves were obtained from the numerical program developed by denner et al . in ref.@xcite .",
    "the two @xmath10 curves correspond to the renormalization scales @xmath144 ( lower curve ) and @xmath145 ( upper curve ) , where @xmath33 is the @xmath12 relative velocity defined in eq.([vdef ] ) .",
    "the latter choice for the fixed - order renormalization scale is motivated by the fact that the relative momentum of the top pair is the scale that governs the coulomb singularities contained in the fixed - order expansion close the large higgs energy end point .",
    "this choice for the fixed - order renormalization scale is therefore the more appropriate one closer to the higgs energy end point .",
    "for the nonrelativistic expansion the renormalization parameters @xmath127 were employed , as in fig .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a - d demonstrate that there is an overlap between the @xmath10 fixed - order prediction and the nll nonrelativistic one in the region where the @xmath12 relative velocity is approximately 0.2 .",
    "( the higgs energy with @xmath146 is indicated in each panel by the solid vertical line . )",
    "the overlap improves for increasing c.m.energies or decreasing higgs masses .",
    "this indicates that in the overlap regions the higher order contributions summed in the nonrelativistic prediction and the higher order relativistic corrections contained in the fixed - order result are both small . for smaller c.m.energies or increasing higgs masses ,",
    "on the other hand , the nll nonrelativistic predictions tend to lie slightly above the @xmath10 fixed - order results ( for @xmath147 ) illustrating the impact of the higher order corrections to each type of expansion .",
    "the discrepancy , however , remains comparable to the uncertainties estimated from the renormalization parameter variation of the nll nonrelativistic prediction .",
    "we therefore conclude that the renormalization parameter variation of the nll order nonrelativistic prediction should provide a realistic estimate of the theoretical uncertainties in the large higgs energy region .",
    "finally , let us discuss the numerical impact of the nonrelativistic contributions in the large higgs energy region on the total cross section .",
    "the results in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] show that the summation of the coulomb singularities and the logarithms of the top quark velocity lead to an enhancement of the cross section and that the portion of phase space where nonrelativistic effects are important increases for decreasing c.m.energy or increasing higgs mass . in tab.[tab3",

    "the term @xmath152 refers to the sum of the @xmath10 fixed - order cross section for @xmath153 using @xmath147 and the nll nonrelativistic cross section for @xmath154 with the renormalization parameter @xmath134 .",
    "the numbers for @xmath152 represent the currently most complete predictions for the total cross section of the process @xmath0 as far as qcd corrections are concerned . for the results for @xmath152",
    "we have also given our estimate for the theoretical error .",

    "[ tab3 ] both uncertainties were added linearly .",
    "the results show that the effect of the summations in the large higgs energy region is particularly important for smaller c.m.energies and larger higgs masses , when the portion of the phase space where the nonrelativistic expansion has to be applied is large . here",

    "the effect of the nonrelativistic summations of contributions from beyond @xmath10 is less pronounced and decreases to the one - percent level for c.m.energies above @xmath159  gev , see column  seven of tab.[tab3 ] .",
    "for all cases , except for very large c.m.energies around @xmath160  gev , however , the shift caused by the terms that are summed up in the nonrelativistic expansion exceeds the theoretical error . in the last column",
    "we have also displayed the ratio of the nll nonrelativistic cross section for @xmath154 with @xmath134 and the @xmath10 fixed - order cross section for @xmath161 with @xmath144 to illustrate the effect of the summation of qcd corrections beyond one loop that have to be carried out in the large higgs energy region .",
    "interestingly , the higher order summations lead to correction factors ranging between about @xmath162 and @xmath163 that are only very weakly dependent of the c.m.energy and the higgs mass . this fact might prove useful for rough implementations of nonrelativistic @xmath12 effects in other high energy processes .",
    "in this paper we have computed the higgs energy distribution for the process @xmath0 in the large higgs energy end point region . due to coulomb singularities @xmath164 and logarithmic divergences @xmath165 that arise at higher order of conventional multiloop - perturbation theory in the large higgs energy end point region , @xmath33 being the top velocity in the @xmath92 c.m.frame , usual fixed - order perturbation theory breaks down .",
    "we use the nonrelativistic effective theory vnrqcd to sum both types of singular terms and determine the higgs energy distribution in the end point region at next - to - leading logarithmic order .",
