    "[ i ] second harmonic generation ( shg ) has nowadays quite a long tradition as a mean of squeezed light generation @xcite .",
    "the preferred experimental setup has been the doubly resonant configuration as , at least in principle , permits arbitrarily large squeezing .",
    "however , such scheme has been hampered by the technical difficulties arising from keeping the resonance in both modes simultaneously .",
    "thus , in spite of the development of very ingenious stabilizing procedures @xcite , for the moment it has been only possible to maintain the double resonance for a few seconds . certainly , this kind of experimental delicacy can hardly surprise when dealing with the generation of non - classical states of light . in view of such difficulties ,",
    "some experimental efforts have been recently redirected to singly resonant configurations @xcite .",
    "although , the maximum noise suppression is then limited to a 90% @xcite , the efforts resulted in very stable intense squeezed light sources with degrees of squeezing even surpassing those reported in the doubly resonant counterparts @xcite .",
    "this evolution highlights the importance of reducing to a minimum the technical demanding of new proposals in a so experimentally challenging field .    at the same time , singly resonant optical parametric oscillation ( opo ) , the most successful method to squeeze the vacuum @xcite , has been generalized to singly resonant optical parametric amplification ( opa ) , i.e. a laser driving in the harmonic mode has been added , again showing an extraordinary stability at quite high noise suppression values in the fundamental mode @xcite . although the squeezed beams are in this case much less intense than the in shg counterpart , this setup permits a control of the phase of the squeezed quadrature , something which allowed a spectacular demonstration using quantum tomography , of the different kinds of squeezed states @xcite .    in view of this experimental success",
    "it seems timely to extend the quantum mechanical model beyond the pure phase matched cases .",
    "more specifically , we address here quantum noise reduction in an extension of the conventional singly resonant shg to include also a coherent input in the harmonic mode as well as phase mismatch between the interacting waves .",
    "on the other hand , an increasingly number of papers is being devoted to study quantum noise in systems combining different kinds of nonlinearities ( see , for instance , @xcite for some recent contributions ) . in particular , the combination of @xmath0 with kerr - like @xmath1 nonlinearities in c.w .",
    "cavity systems has been quite extensively studied @xcite .",
    "even exact full quantum results have been obtained showing , for instance , the emergence of tristability not present in the classical counterpart @xcite . with respect to the squeezing performance",
    "the results appear as very promising at least in degenerate doubly resonant configurations @xcite . the simplest system from the implementation point of view , combining this two kinds of nonlinearities that the authors can think of is precisely a singly resonant second order nonlinear system with phase mismatched interacting waves as then , by virtue of the cascading effect , an effective kerr - like third order nonlinearity appears .    in order to make the search of strong noise reduction through the parameter space affordable we are bounded to the standard linearization procedures , the only capable of yielding analytical results . inside the linear approximation perfect",
    "squeezing is possible at dynamic instabilities .",
    "we make use of this fact to find optimum working points showing up maximum squeezing .",
    "they are , however , an artifact of the method as the linear approximation breaks down at the instabilities .",
    "what matters for the practical implementation of new squeezed light sources ( our ultimate goal ) are the optimum paths through the parameter space approaching such points .",
    "let us explain a little more what we mean .",
    "fixed a particular parameter there will be a set of values of the remaining parameters ( including the frequency as such ) tuned up to yield the maximum noise reduction . when the chosen parameter is varied an optimum path is defined by the set of parameter values maximizing the noise reduction at any stage of the variation .",
    "the real optimum working point will be somewhere along these paths before reaching an instability .",
    "thus , these paths would guide the experimentalist towards the optimum working point in the real experimental setup .",
    "the essence of our approach to find such paths will be to isolate the dynamic aspect of the squeezing behavior from the static contributions to the noise coming from the different inputs .",
    "a simple adequate normalization will disentangle the two aspects of the quantum noise behavior .",
    "this simplifies the analysis sufficiently to allow a characterization of the optimum paths .",
    "another crucial issue when dealing with the squeezing performance of a system is precisely the election of the most relevant parameter to compare the different configurations with each other or with the reported related experiments .",
    "there is no universal criterion to determine the squeezing efficiency of a given device .",
    "an efficient setup regarding power consumption , i.e. , when compared for fixed input power could well be deceptive when compared for the same output power and perhaps inadequate to some spectroscopic applications .",
    "however , within the state of the art of the present squeezed light generators , the main concern is to improve the squeezing figures themselves having other considerations such as the power consumption a relative importance .",
    "under this perspective probably the parameter of utmost importance as far as c.w .",
    "resonant systems are concerned is the energy load inside the cavity . indeed ,",
    "the usual causes of squeezing degradation such as blue - light - induced red absorption come from an excessive mean photon number inside the cavity capable of significantly degrade the material optical response at the relevant frequencies .",
    "these considerations will lead us to define another normalization this time useful for the evaluation of the squeezing efficiency with respect to the intra - cavity photon number .",

    "the quantum mechanical model is presented . in section [ lee ]",
    "the evolution equations are linearized , the fixed points of the system obtained and their stability studied .",

    "is developed which allows the definition of general criteria to characterize the optimum paths and applied to the specific case here addressed .",

    "we will also assume just one input - output mirror of finite reflectivity .",
    "the effect of phase mismatch when only the fundamental mode is driven has been experimentally studied in @xcite where bistability induced by cascading was demonstrated .",

    "even in @xcite , a doubly resonant system specifically designed to squeeze the fundamental mode , the escape efficiency was around 0.9 , limiting the maximum squeezing achievable to 90% ( in practice , a 52% of noise reduction was reached ) .",
    "it appears , then , that nowadays the @xmath149 should be taken rather as an ideal illustrative case .    in contrast , the ultimate limit for the noise suppression in the harmonic mode ( eq .  ( [ eq : ilimit ] ) ) is pushed up by the fundamental mode photon number , opening a way to bypass the usual untouchable limit imposed by the escape efficiency of the cavity ( as in the fundamental mode )",
    ". therefore , the squeezing in the harmonic mode can be arbitrarily large under the ideal assumption that the energy load inside the cavity can be also arbitrarily large .",
    "however , this is not totally true as the model does not take into account the losses in the harmonic mode which necessarily limit the degree of noise suppression .",
    "we can estimate this limitation assuming the absorption in one single pass through the nonlinear material equivalent to the effect of a beam splitter with the adequate reflectivity .",
    "taking an absorption of 0.6%/cm as in @xcite and a length of 1 cm , the equivalent reflectivity would be of @xmath221 .",
    "the spectrum after the beam splitter is given by @xmath222 .",
    "setting @xmath223 and @xmath224 , the ultimate squeezing achievable is precisely @xmath225 , i.e. - 22 db . in other words , the chosen value of @xmath188 in figs .",

    "this ratio must be high enough in order to prevent a degradation of the nonlinear optical response in the system as commented in the introduction . besides , this ratio scales down the power available in the external sources . in view of these complications ,",
    "probably the most reliable way of setting the physical scale of @xmath131 is to compare the results with the reported experiments . in @xcite",
    "the quoted noise reduction was of -5.2 db .",

    "thus , 10 db of noise suppression are reached at @xmath229 , no such unthinkable value .",
    "however , -15 db of noise reduction requires @xmath230 , while a -20 db figure is at the @xmath188 limit , an order of magnitude higher .",
    "new nonlinear materials seem the only possibility for such high squeezing degrees .",
    "a promising via consists in the use of resonant nonlinearities in asymmetric quantum wells ( aqw ) .",

    "this can be a problem as the ratio @xmath226 could at the end of the day not be increased . to asses",
    "this possibility requires quite a detailed analysis out of the scope of the present work .",
    "we can foreseen , however , a promising advantage in the fact that the losses in the harmonic mode have little influence on the performance . by maintaining a strong two photon resonance but relaxing the one photon counterpart ( tuning with a d.c . field or by an adequate energy level engineering )",
    ", the nonlinearity would be certainly enhanced while the losses at the fundamental mode would not increase so strongly , thus enhancing @xmath226 . with only one passage through the cavity of the harmonic mode and taking into account",
    "that a very thin layer of material is capable of shg @xcite , the corresponding deleterious effect can not be very large .",
    "even a more exciting possibility comes from the recent experimental demonstrations of absorption inhibition in aqw induced by quantum interference @xcite .",
    "the absorption transparency and the resonant enhancement can be combined using an adequate quantum well engineering leading to very efficient frequency doublers ( see @xcite , where precisely a scheme only resonant at the harmonic mode is proposed ) .",
    "these are certainly promising perspectives but we should not dismiss the improvements arising at the range of the present nonlinear crystals performances . let us center then , around @xmath227 . as shown in the previous section the best strategy corresponds to drive both modes with relative phases @xmath231 ( negative @xmath196 ) and @xmath117 .      in fig .",

    "let us summarize the most relevant results .",
    "firstly , for any system with only one effective mode we have given a systematic approach capable of isolating the processing of quantum noise by the dynamic response of the system .",
