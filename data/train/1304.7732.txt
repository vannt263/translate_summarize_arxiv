    "in the recent decade magnetoelectricity has become one of the focal points of interest for both the magnetic and ferroelectric communities .",
    "the potentialities of combining magnetic and ferroelectric properties in the same system and , which is more important , the possibility of controlling one property by altering the other , open the way to new interesting applications .",
    "the promising applications of the magnetoelectric effect include new types of devices for reading , writing , and storage of information  @xcite , various sensors  @xcite , microwave  @xcite and spintronics  @xcite devices , and wireless energy transfer and energy harvesting technologies  @xcite .",
    "therefore considerable efforts are devoted from both the theoretical and experimental points of view to the search of new magnetoelectric crystals and explanation of their properties .",
    "the vast experimental data accumulated during the past years allows establishing specific features pertinent to magnetoelectrics , which have been summarized in recent reviews .",
    "the magnetoelectrics can be divided into two classes  @xcite . to",
    "the so - called type - i magnetoelectrics , which are sometimes referred to as ferroelectromagnets , belong crystals in which ferroelectricity and magnetic order appear independently and have different sources .",
    "the prominent examples are bifeo@xmath3  @xcite and ymno@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "type - i multiferroics are usually characterized by rather high ferroelectric transition temperatures and large electric polarization ( @xmath7 10  100@xmath8 ) , but the generally large difference between the ferroelectric and magnetic transition temperatures and the different causes of the two orders result in small coupling between them  @xcite .    the second class , the type - ii magnetoelectrics , is comprised of multiferroics , in which electric polarization appears upon magnetic phase transitions .",
    "this class is generally characterized by much lower transition temperatures ( 10  40  k ) and rather low electric polarization values ( usually of the order of 10  100@xmath9 ) .",
    "the prominent examples of such magnetoelectrics are rare - earth manganites rmno@xmath3 ( r = gd , tb , and dy )  @xcite . compared to ferroelectromagnets",
    "the type - ii multiferroics provide much stronger magnetoelectric coupling due to the fact that electric polarization is induced by magnetic order .",
    "therefore , application of external magnetic field alters the magnetic structure , which may result in suppression , induction , rotation , or a flop of electric polarization . in this paper",
    "we focus on the type - ii magnetoelectrics .",
    "two main features of the type - ii magnetoelectrics can be established from the analysis of the vast experimental data available to date .",
    "the first one consists in the fact that magnetoelectrics often exhibit complex temperature  pressure or temperature  magnetic field phase diagrams with alternating magnetically ordered modulated , commensurate , and magnetoelectric phases .",
    "common appearance of incommensurate magnetically ordered phases and the frequent emergence of electric polarization in them determine the description of magnetoelectricity from both the micro- and macroscopic points of view . despite the fact that ferroelectricity can be also induced by commensurate magnetism ( as , for example , in rare - earth manganates rmn@xmath1o@xmath6  @xcite ) , this manifests itself in consideration of various complex magnetic orders such as screw , cycloidal , helix , and others as sources of magnetoelectricity  @xcite .    from the macroscopic crystal symmetry point of view the close connection between the appearance of modulated and ferroelectric phases in magnetoelectrics",
    "was recently pointed out by the present authors  @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out , in particular , that in some magnetoelectrics the transformational properties of magnetic order parameters are described by the irreducible representations ( ir ) not satisfying the lifshitz criterion .",
    "this results in long - periodical modulation of the magnetic order , as well as in ferroelectric states among the low symmetry phases induced by these order parameters .",
    "unlike other phenomenological models ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) , in which one employs separate order parameters for different experimentally observed modulation wave vectors , our approach provides the whole picture description using the minimal number of order parameters . in the case when a commensurate magnetically ordered phase is present in the phase diagram , the order parameters belonging to its wave vector are chosen and the incommensurate phases are found to be well described by the existing lifshitz invariants .",
    "this is , for example , the case of rmn@xmath1o@xmath6  @xcite , mnwo@xmath0  @xcite , and cuo  @xcite . in other cases ( such as , for example , in cucl@xmath1  @xcite ) , when the magnetic order does not lock - in to a commensurate structure , one may choose the commensurate wave vector closest to that of the incommensurate phases to define the order parameters .",
    "this approach is justified by the fact that such models as , for example , the annni model , which describe the magnetic structure by the ising or heisenberg hamiltonians , show a multitude of incommensurate phases , but nevertheless usually have commensurate magnetic structure as the ground state  @xcite .",
    "another well established peculiarity of magnetoelectrics consists in the following .",
    "neutron diffraction studies of many magnetoelectrics and the respective symmetry analysis reveal that the description of the experimentally observed magnetic structures requires two or more magnetic order parameters belonging to the same wave vector  @xcite .",
    "these order parameters transform according to a single or different ir s of the symmetry group of the paraelectric and paramagnetic phase ( paraphase ) and induce electric polarization acting simultaneously .",
    "indeed , in the case where the space group of the initial paraphase possesses spatial inversion and the resulting magnetic cell of the magnetically ordered phase coincides with the initial chemical cell ( i.e. , when @xmath10 ) magnetic order parameters transforming according to a single ir can not induce polarization  @xcite .",
    "however , this is generally not the case for @xmath11 , for which a single magnetic order parameter may induce electric polarization  @xcite .",
    "it is found that , for example , in tbmno@xmath3  @xcite and mnwo@xmath0  @xcite two different order parameters condense successively , whereas in cucl@xmath1  @xcite they condense simultaneously .",
    "these order parameters transform according to different irreducible representations of the crystal space group .",
    "therefore , for the correct phenomenological description of the magnetic phase transitions in these magnetoelectrics it is necessary to assume the proximity of instabilities with respect to different irreducible representations on the thermodynamic path  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze several magnetoelectrics ( mnwo@xmath0 , cuo , pyroxenes nafesi@xmath1o@xmath2 and nafege@xmath1o@xmath2 , cu@xmath3nb@xmath1o@xmath4 , @xmath5-cacr@xmath1o@xmath0 , and fete@xmath1o@xmath6br ) from the point of view of crystal and exchange symmetry .",
    "we show that in all the considered cases their magnetic structures are described by ir s entering into a single exchange multiplet .",
    "for all the studied magnetoelectrics except for fete@xmath1o@xmath6br we introduce praphase structures , which are more symmetric crystal structures that can be obtained by small atomic displacements . in the cases of mnwo@xmath0 and cuo",
    "we show that their magnetically ordered phases are described by a single ir of the space group of the praphase . therefore",
    ", the complex phase diagrams of the studied magnetoelectrics can be interpreted as induced by a single ir either of the space group of the praphase or of the symmetry group of the exchange hamiltonian , which explains the proximity of various magnetic instabilities in magnetoelectrics .",
    "furthermore , even when the introduction of the praphase does not lead to the reduction of the number of order parameters , taking into account latent pseudosymmetries allows determining the influence of external magnetic or electric fields or elastic stresses of certain symmetry on the phase transitions . for mnwo@xmath0 and cuo",
    "we obtain temperature - magnetic field phase diagrams for certain field directions .",
    "the phase diagram for mnwo@xmath0 is in excellent qualitative correspondence with the experimental one , whereas that for cuo predicts new magnetic field - induced phases .",
    "the magnetic structures of the new phases in cuo as well as those of the phases * hf * , * iv * , and * v * of mnwo@xmath0 are discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we recall the basics of the symmetry of the exchange hamiltonian and its relation to the crystal symmetry , in we briefly discuss the application of the praphase concept to the theory of phase transitions , in   we perform the analysis of magnetic phase transitions in several magnetoelectrics using the exchange symmetry and the praphase concept , and in we discuss the obtained results .",
    "exchange interaction prevails in the magnetic structure formation of most of the magnetically ordered crystals  @xcite . in the simplest case",
    "the exchange hamiltonian can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the @xmath14th atom spin operator in the @xmath15th unit cell and @xmath16 is the exchange integral between the atoms @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the system of spins exceeding @xmath19",
    "the hamiltonian   contains terms of higher order with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "many - spin exchange is also possible .",
    "the exchange hamiltonian   depends only on the mutual orientation of spins and is , therefore , invariant with respect to simultaneous arbitrary angle rotation of all spins around any axis .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic structure relative to the crystal axes is determined by the relativistic interactions ( e. g. spin - orbit or dipole - dipole interaction ) , which in many cases are weaker than the exchange interaction  @xcite .    when building a phenomenological theory of magnetic phase transitions in crystals one usually proceeds from the symmetry of the disordered paramagnetic phase .",
    "the experimentally observed magnetically ordered states are then classified according to ir s of space group of the paramagnetic phase .",
    "thus , the exact symmetry of the exchange as well as relativistic interactions is taken into account . however , the symmetry of exchange interactions is higher , than that of the relativistic ones . consequently , in cases when the exchange interaction prevails in determining the magnetic structure , the information on the exchange interaction symmetry is lost .",
    "additional symmetry of the exchange interactions leads to additional exchange energy degeneracy of magnetic states , compared to that corresponding to the space group symmetry  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one first has to consider the symmetry of the exchange hamiltonian and then take into account the exact space symmetry of the crystal .",
    "the symmetry group of the exchange hamiltonian ( the exchange group ) is given by the direct product @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the space group acting on the atom coordinates , @xmath23 is the rotational group in the spin space , and @xmath24 is the inversion group containing the unit element and spin inversion  @xcite . it can be shown that every ir @xmath25 of the crystal space group , which is characterized by the wave vector star @xmath26 and which enters into the permutational representation of the atoms forming the magnetic structure , induces ir @xmath27 of the exchange group  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath28 is the representation giving the transformational properties of a pseudovector . to determine the connection between the irreducible representation of the exchange group with those of the space group one has to expand the limitation of @xmath29 on the space group with respect to its ir s  @xcite @xmath30 here @xmath31 are the expansion coefficients .",
    "the irreducible representations entering into expansion   are degenerate with respect to exchange energy and form the exchange multiplet  @xcite .",
    "the splitting of the energy of states corresponding to different ir s in the exchange multiplet is determined by anisotropic relativistic interactions and in many cases is small due to the smallness of these interactions compared to the exchange energy .",
    "therefore , the magnetic structure may be determined by a set of ir s of the space group , which form the exchange multiplet  @xcite .",
    "the praphase concept is widely used in many fields of science from elementary particle physics to the solid state . in the phase transition theory in crystals the praphase concept",
    "is widely used , for example , in description of reconstructive phase transitions  @xcite . adapting it to the needs of the present work",
    "the concept can be briefly described as follows .",
    "when building a phenomenological theory of phase transitions one starts with a symmetry @xmath32 of the parent phase .",
    "sometimes the crystal structure of the parent phase can be transformed by small relative displacements of the constituting atoms to a structure of higher symmetry @xmath33 .",
    "one may expect that this high symmetry structure , referred to as praphase , is realized upon temperature increase , however the decomposition or melting of the sample may occur earlier .",
    "the phase transition @xmath34 is described by a generally multicomponent order parameter @xmath35 .",
    "thus , one can base the phase transition model on the higher symmetry praphase structure taking into account that @xmath36 .",
    "the introduction of praphase improves the phase transition model by taking into account latent pseudosymmetries in the object under study . in the following we analyze a set of magnetoelectrics using the praphase concept and exchange symmetry .",
    "the praphase structures of the pyroxenes and cu@xmath3nb@xmath1o@xmath4 were found using the program pseudo located at the _ bilbao crystallographic server _ ( http://www.cryst.ehu.es/ )  @xcite .",
    "wolframite mnwo@xmath0 has become one of the prominent examples of magnetoelectrics since it shows incommensurate paraelectric and ferroelectric magnetically ordered phases , low - temperature commensurate magnetic phase , and complex temperature  magnetic field phase diagrams . at room temperature",
    "it possesses a monoclinic structure described by the space group @xmath37 ( c@xmath38 )  @xcite . on lowering",
    "the temperature mnwo@xmath0 undergoes a sequence of magnetic phase transitions at @xmath39=13.5  k , @xmath40=12.7  k , and @xmath41=7.6  k , which lead to the appearance of magnetically ordered states * af3 * , * af2 * , and * af1 * , respectively  @xcite . the structure of the low - temperature commensurate magnetic phase * af1 * is described by the wave vector @xmath42 , whereas the incommensurate phases * af2 * and * af3 * are characterized by the wave vector @xmath43  @xcite . in the phases * af1 * and * af3 * the collinearly aligned magnetic moments are confined to the @xmath44 plane forming an angle of about @xmath45 with the @xmath46 axis ( this direction is hereafter referred to as the easy axis ) , whereas in the * af2 * phase there appears an additional component along the @xmath47 axis .",
    "electric polarization along the @xmath47 axis appears at the second phase transition at @xmath40 from the paraelectric * af3 * phase to the ferroelectric * af2 * one  @xcite .",
    "the polarization @xmath48 continuously changes through @xmath40 and drops abruptly to zero at @xmath41 .",
    "the dielectric constant @xmath49 shows a sharp peak at @xmath40 and a steplike change at @xmath41 when the ferroelectric order disappears  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic phase transitions in wolframite were studied theoretically in a number of works  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite the authors developed phenomenological models of phase transitions in mnwo@xmath0 starting with the order parameters belonging to the incommensurate wave vector @xmath50 . in",
    "@xcite only the spin components along the easy and @xmath47 axes are considered , which precludes the description of the magnetic field - induced * hf * phase as discussed below  @xcite .    in a recent work  @xcite",
    "quirion and plumer suggested a landau theory of magnetic phase transitions in monoclinic multiferroics and applied it to mnwo@xmath0 and cuo .",
    "the magnetic phase diagrams for various magnetic field directions obtained from the model are in remarkable qualitative agreement with the experimental data . however , from our point of view the suggested model is not relevant neither to mnwo@xmath0 nor to cuo due to the following . in the model",
    "the magnetic structures of both mnwo@xmath0 and cuo are described by a complex pseudovector * s*. this implies that for every direction @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 the magnetic structures are described by a two - dimensional order parameter @xmath54 , which makes the whole magnetic representation 6-dimensional",
    ". however , the magnetic representations in both mnwo@xmath0 and cuo are 12-dimensional  @xcite .",
    "( both mnwo@xmath0 and cuo possess two magnetic ions in the primitive cell and their magnetic structures are described by the stars of wave vectors possessing two arms , which results in 12-dimensional magnetic representations for mn@xmath55 and cu@xmath55 ions , respectively  @xcite . )",
    "thus , despite excellent qualitative ( and to some extent even quantitative ) agreement in the topology of the calculated and experimental phase diagrams the model intrinsically can not reproduce neither the correct magnetic structures nor various macroscopic properties .",
    "for example , in the magnetic structure of the magnetic field - induced phase * hf * of mnwo@xmath0 as obtained in  @xcite the magnetic moments are directed along the two - fold axis of the monoclinic cell , which contradicts the experimental results  @xcite as well as the prediction from our model as discussed below .",
    "we also obtain different predictions for the magnetic structure of the newly discovered phase * af3 * in cuo  @xcite as discussed in .",
    "this illustrates how careful one should be when comparing multiparametric models to experiments .    in our previous work  @xcite we developed a phenomenological model of phase transitions using magnetic order parameters belonging to the @xmath56 point of the brillouin zone and accounted for the incommensurate phases by means of lifshitz invariants",
    "we also suggested that the phase transitions in wolframite be described starting from the orthorhombic praphase  @xcite . in this section using the praphase concept and exchange symmetry we discuss the magnetic structures of the magnetic field - induced phases * hf * , * iv * , and * v * and the magnetic field - induced flop of electric polarization ( with magnetic field applied along the easy axis ) .    in  @xcite we developed a phenomenological model of magnetic phase transitions in wolframite starting from the monoclinic structure @xmath37 .",
    "the magnetically ordered phases are described by the order parameters belonging to the star of wave vector @xmath56 . in this point of the brillouin zone",
    "the space group possesses two two - dimensional ir s @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the phases * af3 * and * af1 * are described by @xmath58 only , whereas @xmath57 additionally condenses in the phase * af2 *  @xcite .",

    "it was argued that the phase transitions in wolframite can be described using orthorhombic praphase  @xcite . in the monoclinic structure with the monoclinic angle @xmath59 the atoms",

    "the space group @xmath68 possesses one four - dimensional ir @xmath73 .",
    "thus , the ir s @xmath57 and @xmath58 stem from @xmath73 , which splits under the action of @xmath72 .",

    "the four quantities @xmath79 for every direction @xmath5 transform according to ir @xmath73 , i.e. , @xmath73 enters three times into the magnetic representation of mn@xmath55 ions .",
    "thus , three order parameters @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) , which give the magnetic moment components along @xmath5 and transform according to @xmath73 , determine the magnetic structure in wolframite .    at low temperatures in the phase * af1 * ( and also in the phase * hf * as suggested in  @xcite ) the magnetic moments are confined to the @xmath44 plane . therefore , in order to determine the magnetic structure of the * hf * phase we consider the order parameters with @xmath51 and @xmath53 only .",
    "the quadratic part of the thermodynamic potential expansion with respect to these order parameters can be written in the form @xmath82 where @xmath46 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 are phenomenological coefficients , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",

    "the sign change of the electric polarization @xmath48 for magnetic fields along the easy axis is explained by the sign change of the magnetoelectric invariant and the obtained dependence of @xmath48 is also in good qualitative correspondence with the experiments .",
    "however , we argue that the nature of the magnetoelectric memory effect for the magnetic field - induced phase transitions sequence * af2 * -*hf*-*iv * is dynamic .    in we applied the praphase concept to cuo .",
    "similarly to wolframite , cuo possesses an orthorhombic praphase and a phase transition to the observed monoclinic structure is described by the deformation tensor component @xmath72 . using the praphase as reference",
    "the magnetic structures of cuo are also described by a 4-dimensional ir which , splits into two two - dimensional ir s under the action of @xmath72 . analogously to mnwo@xmath0 we build the magnetic phase diagram in magnetic fields parallel to @xmath216 $ ] and @xmath217 $ ] , which thus possess the same symmetry as @xmath72 .",
    "our approach allows suggesting the magnetic structures of the newly discovered phase * af3 * , as well as of the magnetic field - induced phases * * af3**@xmath221 and * hf*. the obtained results are in disagreement with the results of the application of the model of quirion and plumer to cuo  @xcite , which from our point of view suffers from the same shortcoming as its use in the case of mnwo@xmath0 .",
    "similar to the cases of mnwo@xmath0 and cuo , the praphase - paraphase phase transition in pyroxenes nafesi@xmath1o@xmath2 and nafege@xmath1o@xmath2 is described by the deformation tensor component @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , external magnetic field applied in the @xmath44 plane will possess strong influence on magnetic phase transitions in pyroxenes , which is indeed observed experimentally , in contrast to magnetic field along the @xmath47 axis  @xcite .",
    "the praphase - paraphase phase transition in cu@xmath3nb@xmath1o@xmath4 is described by the order parameter @xmath356 possessing the symmetry of the deformation tensor components @xmath357 and @xmath358 . studies of this compound in magnetic fields were not performed yet . however , it can be argued that the magnetic fields with @xmath480 and @xmath481 will have the strongest influence on magnetic phase transitions in cu@xmath3nb@xmath1o@xmath4 as discussed in .    in the case of @xmath5-cacr@xmath1o@xmath0 the praphase - paraphase phase transition",
    "is described by component @xmath482 of a multi - component non - tensor order parameter with @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of hexagonal pseudosymmetry allows drawing important conclusions concerning the behavior of @xmath5-cacr@xmath1o@xmath0 in external magnetic fields . as discussed in some of the phenomenological interactions allowed by orthorhombic symmetry and reflecting the interaction of magnetic field with the magnetic structure in @xmath5-cacr@xmath1o@xmath0",
    "can be argued to be small , because they become proportional to @xmath483 when considered from the hexagonal praphase .",
    "moreover , in the hexagonal praphase the magnetic structure is described by a star with six nonequivalent vectors .",
    "due to orthorhombic distortion only two of them appear upon magnetic phase transitions .",
    "however , external magnetic fields applied along certain directions induce magnetic structures corresponding to the remaining four arms . therefore , additional magnetic reflections in the @xmath433 brillouin zone point of the orthorhombic lattice should be observed .",
    "single - crystal studies of @xmath5-cacr@xmath1o@xmath0 in external magnetic fields are required in order to confirm these predictions .",
    "in summary , we performed representation analysis of magnetic phase transitions in several magnetoelectrics using the praphase concept and taking into account the symmetry of the exchange hamiltonian .",
    "this approach allowed explaining the closeness of successive magnetic instabilities on the thermodynamic path and clarifying the behavior of these magnetoelectrics in external magnetic fields of certain directions .",
