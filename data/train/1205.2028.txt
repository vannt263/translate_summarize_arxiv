    "the camassa - holm ( ch ) equation @xmath9 was derived by camassa and holm @xcite as a shallow water wave model . in recent years , this equation has attracted much attention in soliton theory . in the literature , this equation was implicitly implied in the paper of fuchssteiner and fokas on hereditary symmetries as a very special case @xcite . however , since the work of camassa and holm @xcite , various studies on this equation have been remarkably developed .",
    "the ch equation possesses many important integrable properties . for instance",
    ", it admits lax representation , bi - hamiltonian structures , multi - soliton solutions , and algebro - geometric solutions @xcite-@xcite . also , it is integrable by the inverse scattering transformation @xcite . the most remarkable feature of the ch equation ( [ bch ] ) is to admit peaked soliton ( peakon ) solutions in the case of @xmath6 .",
    "a peakon is a weak solution in some sobolev space with corner at its crest .",
    "the stability and interaction of peakons were discussed in several references @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition to the ch equation being an integrable model with peakon solutions , other integrable peakon models have been found .",
    "those models include the degasperis - procesi equation @xcite-@xcite and the cubic nonlinear peakon equations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the present paper focuses on the following equation with both quadratic and cubic nonlinearity : @xmath10_x+\\frac{1}{2}k_2(2 m u_x+m_xu ) , \\quad m = u - u_{xx},\\label{bchfforq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are three arbitrary constants .",
    "it is clear that equation ( [ bchfforq ] ) is reduced to the ch equation ( [ bch ] ) when we take @xmath11 , @xmath12 . for @xmath13 , @xmath8 , equation ( [ bchfforq ] )",
    "is exactly the cubic nonlinear equation : @xmath14_x=0 , \\quad m = u - u_{xx},\\label{qe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which was derived independently by fokas @xcite , by fuchssteiner @xcite , by olver and rosenau @xcite , and by qiao @xcite where the equation was derived from the two - dimension euler system , and lax pair , the m / w - shape solitons and cuspon solutions were presented .",
    "recently , gui , liu , olver and qu worked out the peakon stability for the cubic nonlinear equation ( [ qe ] ) in the case of @xmath6 @xcite .    equation ( [ bchfforq ] ) is actually a linear combination of ch equation ( [ bch ] ) and cubic nonlinear equation ( [ qe ] ) .",
    "therefore , we may view equation ( [ bchfforq ] ) as a generalization of the ch equation , or simply call equation ( [ bchfforq ] ) a generalized ch equation .",
    "this structure is very similar to the one in dealing with the gardner equation , known as a linear combination of kdv and mkdv equations , which has important applications in various areas of physics @xcite .",
    "in fact , the structure of gardner equation is our mainly starting point to study equation ( [ bchfforq ] ) .",
    "we also notice that by some appropriate rescaling , equation ( [ bchfforq ] ) might implicitly be implied in the paper of fokas and fuchssteiner in the context of hereditary symmetries @xcite .    in this paper , we first present the lax representation , bi - hamiltonian structure and infinitely many conservation laws for equation ( [ bchfforq ] ) .",
    "this indicates that equation ( [ bchfforq ] ) is completely integrable .",
    "then we show that this equation possesses the single peakon of traveling wave type as well as multi - peakon solutions in the case of @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , for the one - peakon case , we find that the complex peakon ( i.e. pekaon with complex coefficient ) appears by properly choosing the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "for the two - peakon case , the peakon dynamical system is explicitly presented and their collisions are discussed in details .",
    "significant difference between the ch equation ( [ bch ] ) and the generalized ch equation ( [ bchfforq ] ) ( for the case of @xmath6 ) is analyzed through a comparison .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to show that equation ( [ bchfforq ] ) with @xmath8 ( namely , cubic nonlinear equation ( [ qe ] ) ) allows the weak kink solution in the case of @xmath7 .",
    "different from the multi - peakon solutions in the form of linear superpositions of the single - peakon , equation ( [ bchfforq ] ) with @xmath8 and @xmath15 does not allow the multi - kink solution in the form of the superpositions of single - kink .",
    "however , we find that equation ( [ bchfforq ] ) with @xmath8 and @xmath15 allows the solutions in the form of the superpositions of single - kink and multi - peakon .",
    "in particular , the weak kink and kink - peakon interactional solutions are shown and plotted . within our knowledge , this is probably the first time discussing the weak kink and kink - peakon interactional solutions . in the paper , we also study all possible smooth one - soliton solutions .",
