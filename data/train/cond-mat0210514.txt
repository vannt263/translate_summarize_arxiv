    "with the growing interest in social network analysis from the physics community , a new research area is emerging in the intersection between statistical physics and sociology ( albert and barabsi 2002 ; dorogovtsev and mendes 2002 ; newman 2003 ) .",
    "sociologists have been interested in network analysis for at least half a century , and with mathematicians and statisticians they have developed a set of tools to analyze positions , structures , and processes of social networks ( wasserman and faust 1994 ; butts 2001 ) . although there are exceptions ( fararo and sunshine 1964 ; skvoretz 1990 ) , most sociological and anthropological studies of networks have focused on small - group interaction or cognitive networks . in one respect",
    "this is quite natural as most groups and formal organizations are of small size .",
    "also , a pragmatic reason for this is that data collection of large social networks , behavioral or cognitive , is cumbersome and often practically impossible to carry through .",
    "therefore , although recent analyses ( watts and strogatz 1998 ; watts 1999 ; newman 2001 ) have brought new attention to comparative analysis of large - scale social networks , the statistical physics method , emphasizing the limit of large system sizes ( albert and barabsi 2002 ) , has been of limited utility .",
    "however , the extended use of database technology provide new possibilities for constructing real world networks for the analysis of e.g.  movie - actor networks ( watts and strogatz 1998 ) and co - authorship in science ( newman 2001 ) .",
    "surely , these networks reflect social interaction , but they are also heavily constrained by the logic of a particular industry or a particular professional activity .",
    "thus , to allow for exploration of the possible universal properties of social networks in general , there is still an urgent need to analyze other types of large empirical social networks .",
    "in this paper we report on an investigation of a large social network , aiming to give a phenomenological description that will hopefully shed some new light on the processes forming the structure of social networks . to put results in context , we try to compare our findings to other studies whenever possible , and to contrast parameters to what would be expected from a random network with similar characteristics .    to construct network data and large graphs based on more spontaneous patterns of human interaction than e.g.  co - authorship and co - actorship",
    ", one can consider data from e - mail exchange ( ebel , mielsch et al .",
    "2002 ) or user activity in internet communities ( rothaermel and sugiyama 2001 ; smith 2002 ) .",
    "the present work belongs to the latter category , with a strong focus on the dynamics of the network .",
    "in contrast to previous studies of internet communities ( smith 2002 ) , we use down - to - the - second timing of the communication to investigate time evolution and obtain steady state estimates of well - known measures of graph structure .",
    "we use data from a swedish internet community called pussokram.com ( roughly `` kissnhug '' in english ) that is primarily targeted at adolescents and young adults .",
    "the community provides an arena for flirting , dating , and other romantic communication ; as well as communication for non - romantic friendship .",
    "studies suggest that online interaction is driven by the same needs as face - to - face interaction , and should not be regarded as a separate arena but as an integrated part of modern social life ( wellman and haythornthwaite 2002 ) .",
    "thus communicative actions taken by members of the community can be expected to share many features with the web of human acquaintances and romances in the social off - line world .",
    "indeed , for many people in contemporary western societies , interaction on the internet is as real as any other interaction ( wellman 2001 ) .",
    "internet communities are interesting by and for themselves , but this suggests that the formation and dynamics of social networks in an internet community can share the same generic properties as all social acquaintance networks , and that the study of internet communities can provide important information for enhancing our understanding of social networks in general .",
    "the paper is divided into four sections . in the next section",
    "we give a detailed description of the functions of the internet community in focus .",
    "the third section contains statistical analyses and presentation of results that we summarize and discuss in the fourth and concluding section .",
    "pussokram.com is a swedish internet community primarily intended for romantic communication and targeted at adolescents and young adults .",
    "the community had around 30@xmath0000 active users during the spring and summer 2002 , the mean user age is 21 years , and approximately 70 percent of the users are women ( therefore , and to simplify , we will use the female gender when referring to users in this paper ) .",
    "both age and sex are self reported .",
    "it is possible to have multiple accounts on the community .",
    "a crude check on the number of accounts linked to every unique e - mail address indicates that this is not very common ( more than 99.7% of the membership accounts are associated with a unique e - mail address and no e - mail address are associated with more than 5 accounts ) .",
    "our data consists of all the user activities on pussokram.com logged for 512 days from 13:39:25 on february 13 , 2001 ( @xmath1 ) to 13:28:19 on july 10 , 2002 .",
    "the smallest time - unit on the log is 1 second .",
    "we analyze the activity of all users registered at time @xmath1 , as well as the activity of any new users during this time span .",
    "time @xmath1 defines the start up day for this particular community .",
    "however prior to @xmath1 there was a mail server for sending anonymous love messages on the internet .",
    "registered users of this service had their accounts automatically transferred to pussokram.com .",
    "we only study activity on the community , nevertheless this recruitment might induce higher initial growth of active users .",
    "pussokram.com has a pronounced romantic profile , where :    * users are encouraged to send messages to others that they are secretly in love with . * the provider answers questions related to love and sex posed by the users under the pseudonym dr",
    ".  love . *",
    "the design of the html - pages makes use of a romantic iconography well known to the targeted users ( with valentine s hearts , deep red colors , etc .",
    ", see fig .",
    "[ fig : pok ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , a quick glance through some of the public guest books reveals that many of the contacts taken are also non - romantic .",
    "there are four major modes of communication at pussokram.com .",
    "we study each of the networks generated by these four types of contacts separately and we also study the union of these networks generated by any of these contacts .",
    "a brief description of the four types of contacts follows :    * the * messages * are in effect intra - community e - mails .",
    "these are private in the sense that no one in the community , except the sender and receiver , can access them .",
    "not even information on how many messages other users have received are retrievable for other users . * in * guest book * signing , each user has a guest book that every community member is free to write in . * * flirt * or `` friendship request : '' user a can ask user b to be her friend . if user b accepts user a s request then they can both easily see if the other is online whenever they are logged onto pussokram.com .",
    "information on the friends of a specific user is private to the user only . *",
    "* friendship * : a friendship relation is established after acceptance of a friendship request , as described above .",
    "the friendship network is thus bi - directional .",
    "a friendship can be canceled by any of the friends .      unless engaged in peer - to - peer contact of some sort ,",
    "users at pussokram.com are relatively anonymous towards each other .",
    "there is reason to believe that knowledge about the prior interactive behavior of other individuals structures the present interactive behavior of a given individual ( the so called imitation factor ) .",
    "the only information about a user s interaction history available to other users .",
    "but there are several ways for an user to draw attention to herself ( i.e.  to direct other users to her community homepage ) , and for users to find information about others . here",
    "we summarize various ways that can be used to receive attention , search for other users , and promote oneself at pussokram.com .",
    "the following information is displayed when a logged on user browse the pussokram.com website :    * the username of the most recently registered community member . * the name of the most recently edited diary ( each user has space open for others to read , intended as a diary ) . * the names of the most recent users to browse a specific user s homepage . *",
    "the names of similar users are displayed on a specific users homepage .",
    "similarity is assesses through self - reported background variables . * a long interview with the `` user of the week '' (",
    "although updated more seldom than weekly ) .",
    "this is an epithet that users can apply for .",
    "* photographs of 10 - 20 users are displayed at the login - page .",
    "a user can search out other users with a search engine ( the `` skofinder''in english `` searchnfinder''in fig .",
    "[ fig : pok ] ) that handles the following criteria : sub - string of the username , gender , age , place of residence , online status , and if a user has provided a photograph of herself . presumably , these are the characteristics that drive user activity , but because it is hard to assess their validity , and because we are only interested in structural properties , we do not conduct any analysis on them .",
    "for comparison we also use networks by instant messaging at the french internet community nioki.com and scientific collaboration ( or , rather , co - authorship ) networks .",
    "nioki.com and pussokram.com are rather similar , both in terms of content and design , but compared to pussokram.com , nioki.com is even more youth oriented and not as focused on romantic relations as pussokram.com .",
    "besides the possibility of searching for user names , nioki.com has two search procedures _",
    "recherche lamiti _ ( search for friendship ) and _ recherche lamour _ ( search for love ) , where one can fill out questionnaires to find other users that match ones preferences .",
    "in the nioki.com network , an arc connects user a to user b if user b is in user a s list of contacts ( for details see ( smith 2002 ) . in the scientific collaboration networks ( newman 2001 ) the vertices are scientists who have uploaded manuscripts to the los alamos preprint repository arxiv.org , arcs are added between scientists who have co - authored a paper .",
    "in contrast to the pussokram.com and nioki.com networks , ties in the scientific collaboration network is bi - directional .",
    "note , that the pussokram.com networks are dynamic , while we only have access to snapshot data of nioki.com and scientific collaboration networks . for this reason we can only make comparisons between the static properties of these networks .",
    "in addition , following ( anderson , butts et al .  1999 ; pattison , wasserman et al .",
    "2000 ; shen - orr , milo et al .",
    "2002 ) , we compare some observed quantities to the corresponding average values from randomized networks with the same degree - sequence as the original . by this approach , we examine how aspects of structures other than the degree sequence , influences the quantities .",
    "every known real social network deviates from the average randomized network in a larger or lesser extent , depending on the social forces structuring the interaction .",
    "for example , with regards to the present case , we believe that an internet community network will be closer to the average randomized network than several other types of social networks , because time and space constraints are much less pressing than in , e.g. , a kinship network .",
    "these randomized networks are generated by sequentially going through all directed arcs a - b , and for every such arc randomly select another arc , c - d , and then rewire so that a - d forms one arc , and c - b forms another .",
    "the choice of c - d is done with uniform randomness among all arcs that would not introduce a loop or a multiple arc .",
    "we use this algorithm to generate @xmath2 networks and the quantities are averaged over these networks .",
    "this procedure is inspired by roberts ( 2000 ) .",
    "however it differs from roberts in the sense that we use sweeps over all arcs ( where each arc is rewired at least once ) as the unit of iterations of the algorithm .",
    "( see sect .",
    "[ sec : stat ] ) . for every arc @xmath3",
    "we construct a set @xmath4 of arcs such that if a member @xmath5 of @xmath4 is to be rewired with @xmath6i.e .  so that @xmath3 and @xmath5 are replaced by @xmath7 and @xmath8then",
    "no loops or multiple arcs are formed",
    ". then we choose one of @xmath9 s arcs with uniform randomness and rewire that arc with @xmath3 . ]",
    "the pussokram.com network consists of all registered users and the communication flow between these users as described above .",
    "communication is conceived of as directed links between users .",
    "this is translated into a graph of vertices ( users ) and arcs ( ties ) .",
    "vertices are added to the network the first time a registered user is active , i.e. the first time the user sends or receives a message , signs a guest book , or sends or accepts a friendship request as described above .",
    "each of these interactions defines a unique network , and by adding an arc for any activity one gets a total network of online activities .",
    "we thus study five networks , and for each of them the vertex set is empty at @xmath10 .",
    "we represent the network as a directed graph , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the vertex set and @xmath9 is the set of arcs , or ordered pairs of vertices .",
    "@xmath13 denotes the order ( number of vertices ) of @xmath14 , and @xmath15 represents the number of arcs .",
    "sometimes we study properties of the undirected graph obtained by taking the reflexive closure of @xmath14 . and",
    "@xmath16 then @xmath17 is added to @xmath9 . ]      for each network , the number of vertices of each network , @xmath18 , as a function of time during the sampling is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : len](a ) , and the average degree , i.e.  the average number of arcs per vertex , @xmath19 , is displayed in fig  [ fig : len](b ) . as can be seen , both the number of vertices and the average degree are increasing as a function of time , but with at a decreasing growth rate .",
    "the average degree appears to converge to a constant , but for @xmath20 , it increases as a power function .",
    "the more rapid growth rate in the beginning of the period is explained by the fact that old users log on for the first time during our sampling period ( see discussion in section  [ sec : pok ] ) .",
    "the decreasing growth , and apparent approach to equilibrium , stand in contrast to the accelerated growth of the internet and the world wide web ( dorogovtsev and mendes 2002 ) , as well the linear growth of scientific co - authorship networks extracted from article databases ( newman 2001 ; newman 2001 ; barabsi , jeong et al .",
    "however , in social networks , the average degree can not be increasing without bounds , and this goes for scientific collaboration networks too .",
    "we believe the difference stems from a wider effective sampling time frame  due to the much more rapid dynamics of an internet community ( compared to scientific collaborations ) we are , relatively speaking , able to follow the process for a much longer period . in the sense that @xmath14 is a steadily growing dynamic network , we deal with a non - equilibrium representation of the social situation .",
    "when we speak of the network `` reaching equilibrium , '' we refer to when all quantities that are bounded as a function of @xmath18 ( such as the average degree ) are reaching their constant limits .",
    "various types of social relations differ in direction , intensity , and frequency ( granovetter 1973 ) .",
    "messages between agents with different social status for example , tend to be unevenly distributed ( gould 2002 ) . in the present analysis",
    ", we can investigate the reciprocity of communicative action by looking at the direction of the communication flow between any two users .",
    "for example , if user a sends a friendship request to user b , we observe a link between user a and user b , and note an arc between the two vertices .",
    "but it makes quite a difference whether user b accepts the invitation or not , i.e.  whether we note one or two arcs between the vertices .",
    "we define reciprocity @xmath21 , as the fraction of mutual dyads , i.e.  the ratio between the number of vertex - pairs @xmath22 occur in two arcs ( @xmath3 and @xmath23 ) and vertex - pairs that occur in at least one arc . more analytically : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of arcs in the reflexive closure of @xmath14 . @xmath21",
    "lies strictly in the interval @xmath26 $ ] ; if @xmath27 is an arc then @xmath28 implies that @xmath17 is not an arc and @xmath29 implies that @xmath17 is an arc .",
    "[ tab : ass ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     values for @xmath30 and @xmath31 and their undirected counterparts are shown in table  [ tab : misc ] .",
    "we note that , with a few exceptions , the values for the real networks are significantly larger than the randomized ; the difference , however , is far less dramatic than for the scientific collaboration network .",
    "this is contrast between the internet community networks and the arxiv.org data is easily explained from the fact that a paper with @xmath32 authors represents a fully connected subgraph of @xmath14 ( contributing with @xmath33 triangles ) .",
    "however , we would like to stress that the values themselves are not very informative , compared to their time dependence .    the time development of @xmath34 and @xmath35 for different networks is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clu ] . as",
    "a quantity dependent on only the local network structure the density of short circuits is an intrinsic quantity ; and , as seen for the clustering coefficient ( barabsi , jeong et al .",
    "2002 ) , these quantities approach their equilibrium values from above . interestingly , just as for the assortative mixing coefficient , the relaxation towards equilibrium is faster for @xmath34 and @xmath35 than for the average degree @xmath19 ; i.e.  the density of short cycles is rather independent of the average degree .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : clu ] , most @xmath34 and @xmath35 curves have extremes in the middle of the time range ( the density of short circuits are at their minima ) .",
    "the reason for this comes from a conflict between counteracting mechanisms of different time - scales .",
    "there are three natural time - scales in the system : the average time between new registrations ; the average time between new contacts for an individual user ; and the average life span of a user in the community .",
    "the latter time - scale should be responsible for the long - term behavior such as the increase towards equilibrium of @xmath36 . and",
    "as shorter circuits are more likely in a dense network , it is natural that @xmath34 and @xmath35 increase in the large @xmath37 limit .",
    "the decrease for early times is a finite size effect that can be seen in evolving network models with constant average degree such as the barabsi - albert model ( barabsi and albert 1999 ; barabsi , albert et al .",
    "1999 ; barabsi , jeong et al .  2002 ) and extensions ( holme and kim 2002 ) , where the @xmath34 and @xmath35 curves converge from above .",
    "another interesting aspect is that the values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , although finite in the large @xmath37 limit , is much smaller than in the actor- and scientific - collaboration networks . in an internet community the way by which people introduce strangers among their acquaintances to each other ( newman 2001 ; holme and kim 2002 ) is likely not the mechanism responsible for the finite clustering ( remember that in network models such as the erds - rnyi ( 1959 ) and barabsi - albert ( barabsi and albert 1999 ; barabsi , albert et al .",
    "1999 ; barabsi , jeong et al .",
    "2002 ) models the clustering goes to zero as the network grows ) . instead",
    "a finite density of short circuits can be explained by the tendency formulated in the proverbial like - attracts - like , where the similarity is defined by signaled social , psychological , and physiological traits . and @xmath35 to finite values",
    "is that short circuits are introduced from the offline world outside the community .",
    "reading users guest books , however , gives the impression that the vast majority of community - dyads were strangers offline .",
    "we believe that this effect is negligible , but we are unfortunately unable to go beyond speculation on this point . ]    to further convince ourselves that the sampling time is large enough we also use rewiring to examine the time evolution of two structural measures ( the assortative mixing coefficient and the clustering coefficient for the undirected all - contacts network ) . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rewi ] the rewired quantities converge in the same time scale as @xmath38 and @xmath34 , which reconfirm that the sampling time frame is sufficient .",
    "we note that for @xmath39 days the assortative mixing coefficient is significantly lower than the rewired reference curve . for the same time interval the rewired clustering coefficient closely overlap the measured @xmath34-value ; for @xmath40 days the actual value overlap the mid - quartiles of the rewired data during around 30% of the 512 days . for the initial ` non - equilibrium ' part ( @xmath20 days ) of the time - evolution",
    "the curves of the rewired and real networks diverges . in this region",
    "the network is rather sparse ( see fig  [ fig : rewi ] ) which explains the low @xmath34-values for the rewired @xmath34-curve .",
    "the high early values of @xmath34 seems contradictory to the apparent absence of tendency towards triangle formation during latter times .",
    "this means that the contact patterns of the early network is no the same as later on .",
    "as it turns out , in the early community , a group of actors contact each other rather frequently ( rather more like ` chatting ' than romantic contact making ) whereas another group makes a few contacts before quitting the community .",
    "we interpret this such that it requires a minimal number , or `` critical mass '' ( cf.schelling 1978 ) of people for the community to function .",
    "before the critical mass is reached , the users either have the community as a chat room ( a usage with a presumably smaller critical mass ) or leave it .",
    "we have investigated networks of communication between the users of the internet community pussokram.com .",
    "the four different means of contact at pussokram.com defines five different networks in our study ( one for each separately and one for all taken together ) .",
    "apart from recent studies of scientific collaboration networks and movie actor networks , there are very few such phenomenological descriptions of large social networks , and thus there is limited knowledge that our findings can be related to .    it is obvious that the fact that the interaction under study takes place on the internet creates special conditions for communication .",
    "we believe that the interaction online is exposed to less structural forces than what is typically the case in most other social settings .",
    "for example , simultaneous interaction is not a prerequisite for communication in an internet community , i.e.  time as a structural force is therefore of less importance than in most other settings . neither does geographical space constraint communication . and",
    "in addition , that social signifiers are less visible ( compared to e.g.  face - to - face interaction ) , and the relative ease with which you can conceal your identity and transform your appearance in online interaction , are factors reducing the structure forming forces at work in ` offline ' social activity .",
    "it is therefore interesting to note , that despite these caveats , the networks under study here are much more structured than what would be expected in a random network .    to summarize our findings of the internet community pussokram.com , we see that :    * the average degree converges over time , but surprisingly we observe no cut - off in the degree distribution .",
    "previous studies do suggest that there is an upper limit to the mean number of contacts ( marsden 1987 ) , and on average we find this socio - cognitive limitation despite the fact that time and space is of less important here .",
    "the reason we see continued growth in the cumulative degree distribution might be that it s relatively costless to have a high turnover on ones contacts in an online community .",
    "contacts are established without much investment , and can also be dropped without much sanctioning .",
    "* reciprocity is rather low , and presumably lower can be expected in a regular acquaintance network .",
    "reciprocity levels quickly converge to a steady state . *",
    "most assortative mixing coefficients have small negative values , suggesting a pattern of dissasortative mixing .",
    "this can partly be explained by the conventional effect from the skewed degree sequence ( newman 2002 ) .",
    "the observed effect is significantly larger than can be expected solely from the degree distribution .",
    "an explanation for these higher @xmath38-values is the particular nature of the dating interaction ( cook , emerson et al .  1983 ) .",
    "we also find that mixing coefficients as a function of time converge rapidly .",
    "the dissasortative mixing in the internet community networks is in striking contrast to the strong assortative mixing seen in scientific collaboration networks , and the nice correspondence with previous work in sociology indicates that internet communities indeed strongly resembles off - line social communities . *",
    "the cumulative degree distributions are highly skewed , being a mixture of previous mappings of acquaintance networks ( amaral , scala et al .",
    "2000)for few contacts  and partnership networks ( liljeros , edling et al .",
    "2001)for many contacts . *",
    "the geodesic length initially increases as new vertices are added to the network .",
    "but as the network settles the increase is limited by the growing average degree .",
    "both @xmath41 and @xmath42 shows consistently that the average geodesic length is decreasing during the whole sample period ( a situation that can only exist for a non - equilibrium network ) . * clustering ",
    "the density of triangles  converges over time to non - zero values ( as opposed to completely random networks ) .",
    "still , values are probably on a much lower level than would be expected in offline acquaintance networks .",
    "the explanation for these low values is twofold  the lack of introduction as a mechanism for tie - formation , and the romantic profile of pussokram.com promoting romantic contacts .",
    "the latter aspect is also manifested in that the density of 4-circuits is larger than the density of triangles for the pussokram.com networks . once again",
    ", the internet community networks are different from the scientific collaboration network where clustering is larger than the density of 4-circuits .",
    "an internet community such as pussokram.com defines a structured social network that share more of the structuring forces with general acquaintance networks than networks of professional collaborations do .",
    "we believe that the precise timing resolution and fast dynamics ( giving a wide effective sampling time - frame ) will make internet communities an invaluable object for future social networks studies of the largest scale .",
