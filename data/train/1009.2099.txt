    "observational and theoretical studies of galaxy rotation curves @xcite , velocity dispersions of elliptical galaxies @xcite , baryon fraction in clusters @xcite , gravitational lensing , structure formation , cmb power spectrum etc . indicate that a significant fraction of the mass of the universe has no electromagnetic interaction @xcite . at galactic scale ,",
    "the main evidence for the existence of such gravitating matter with very high mass to light ratio comes from observations of galaxy rotation curves .",
    "the gravitational potential derived from the observed rotation curve can not be explained only by the visible mass with any reasonable mass to light ratio @xcite .",
    "though there are modified theories of the gravitation and other suggestions @xcite to explain this anomaly , the dark matter concept is widely accepted to be a simpler explanation of these observations . though observations of galaxy rotation curves established the existence of the dark matter at galactic scale , there is no general agreement on the nature and various properties ( like mass distribution ) of this major constituent of the universe @xcite .",
    "potentially , galaxy rotation curves can also shed light on some aspects of the dark matter properties and thus help us in deriving a better understanding of the nature of the dark matter .",
    "one such key aspect is the density profile or the mass distribution of the dark matter at galactic scale .    on the theoretical front",
    ", there are various mass distribution models of the dark matter halo .",
    "the isothermal profile , the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile and some variant of these two profiles are used extensively in both theoretical and observational studies . an almost flat observed rotation curve outside the core of a galaxy led to the dark matter halo model with @xmath0 isothermal density profile @xcite .",
    "the density at the centre is not finite in this model .",
    "however , it is possible to impose appropriate boundary conditions to derive a non - singular solution with density @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the central density and @xmath3 is the `` core radius '' . at large radius",
    ", this profile will be similar to @xmath0 singular isothermal profile .",
    "a cut - off radius @xmath4 is also required to be imposed to keep the total mass of the halo finite . however , the non - singular isothermal profile was not very successful in explaining the observed rotation curves .",
    "a significant progress in the field was the introduction of an alternative density profile , the nfw density profile , @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath6 and @xmath3 are the characteristic density and characteristic radius respectively @xcite .",
    "the nfw profile has been quite successful in explaining the observed rotation curves for many galaxies . over the time ,",
    "a class of variant of the isothermal and the nfw profiles are also introduced to fine tune the agreement of theory and observations @xcite .",
    "all these density profiles are of more or less similar merit , as far as explaining the rotation curve is concerned .",
    "however , detailed analysis shows that the nfw profile has a number of problems .",
    "for example , observations of galaxies and clusters suggest a central flat density core @xcite , whereas , in nfw profile , dark matter density has a central cusp with a logarithmic slope @xmath7 .",
    "numerical simulations show that the presence of baryon can change the mass distribution significantly ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and for isothermal cusp , minor merger and dynamical friction may lead to a shallower central density slope @xcite .",
    "the nfw profile also seems not to fit the observed rotation curves of the dark matter dominated low surface brightness galaxies and low mass dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "a more serious issue with the nfw profile is that the profile is derived by fitting analytical function to the density distribution derived from numerical simulation of structure formation with dark matter .",
    "this , in a sense , lacks a proper physical understanding .",
    "though some physical insight of the nfw profile have recently come from further high resolution dark matter simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the issue is far from being settled .",
    "moreover , even if these cosmological simulations are very successful on large scale , at galactic scale there are unsolved issues , like the `` angular momentum problem '' @xcite or the `` missing satellite problem '' @xcite , which are yet to be addressed .    here , we have developed a self - consistent model of the dark matter halo substructure distribution at galactic scale to explain observed nfw - like rotation curves .",
    "support for the existence of dark matter substructures has mainly come from numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "but , there are strong observational hints like flux anomalies and time delays in gravitational lensing @xcite , or enhanced gamma rays and leptonic cosmic rays @xcite , indicating the presence of substructures .",
    "the present model is based on the assumption of a scale free nature of the dark matter clustering that leads to a statistically self - similar distribution of the halo substructures at galactic scale .",
    "it is shown that a simple fractal model of the dark matter halo substructure predicts an nfw - like rotation curve .",
    "such a model also predicts a scale free power spectrum of the rotation velocity fluctuations .",
    "the model is described in section  [ sec : model ] , and the results are presented in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "possible limitations of our analysis are discussed in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "finally , we summarize and present our conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "assuming that the dark matter clustering has a scale free nature ( i.e. , there exist halo substructures of a wide range of mass ) , the density profile can be described as a combination of a smooth radial profile @xmath8 and a stochastic part @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath3 is a characteristic `` core '' radius and @xmath10 contains information of the density variation at scales larger than or comparable to @xmath3 . for the purpose of this work ,",
    "we have used a simpler model of this density distribution which , however , retains all relevant key features . in this simplified model , we have assumed that each dark matter clump has a number of smaller clumps around it .",
    "each of these smaller clumps are in turn just a scaled down version with even smaller clumps around them . as a result , the whole structure has an approximate spherical symmetry and a statistical self - similarity .",
    "it is assumed here that all these clumps have non - singular isothermal density profile where the central density ( @xmath2 ) , the core radius ( @xmath3 ) , the cut - off radius ( @xmath4 ) and the halo to subhalo distance ( @xmath11 ) are scaled down accordingly .",
    "however , this specific density profile is not a crucial assumption in our model and the individual substructures may have any non - singular density profile @xmath12 , where @xmath3 is some characteristic radius .",
    "essentially , this is a fractal structure with three parameters : ( i ) @xmath13 , the number of small clumps around any clump , ( ii ) @xmath14 , spatial scaling factor for core radius , cut - off radius and distance and ( iii ) @xmath15 , central density scaling factor between any clump and its next smallest clumps .",
    "a fractal is a fragmented and irregular geometrical shape with exact or stochastic self - similar structures at all scales @xcite .",
    "independent of the value of @xmath14 and @xmath13 , the ( hausdorff ) fractal dimension of such a structure is @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "however , since at each iteration , the linear size of clumps scales by a factor @xmath14 and the mass scales by a factor @xmath13 , the local mass dimension for any substructure level is @xmath18 over a certain range of scales .",
    "a mass dimension of @xmath19 for a medium implies that the mass enclosed in a sphere of radius @xmath20 in such a medium will be @xmath21 .",
    "so , for the @xmath22 substructure level , @xmath23 over a range of scales depending on @xmath24 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath11 and @xmath4 .",
    "note that this range is different for different substructure levels .",
    "hence , for the complete structure , the total mass @xmath25 , which is the sum of @xmath26 of all the substructure levels , will not have a simple power law radial dependence .",
    "but , the dark matter halo mass function will still be a power law , @xmath27 , where the power law index @xmath28 is a more physically motivated parameter of this model and can be constrained from theoretical and numerical analysis of dark matter structure formation @xcite .",
    "the density distribution can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is background density and @xmath31 is density profile of individual substructure centred at @xmath32 with central density ( @xmath33 ) , core radius ( @xmath34 ) and cut - off radius ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "considering the self - similarity of this model , @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is a unit length vector with random orientation and the initial set of parameters @xmath39 is for the largest subhalo centered at the origin . in principle , @xmath30 may be a smooth function of @xmath20 .",
    "but , since we are assuming it to be a small background density threshold , its effect on the final rotation curve is not very significant .",
    "so , for simplicity , we have assumed @xmath30 to be constant over the radius of our interest .",
    "this structure is shown schematically ( without any randomness for the shake of clarity ) in the left panel of figure  [ fig : dmfrac ] .",
    "after introducing randomness in angular position of the subhalos , one realization of such a structure with @xmath40 and @xmath41 is shown with two and four substructure levels in the middle and right panel respectively .",
    "this model can be considered as a simplified representation of the scale free , clumpy density structure of dark matter above a small threshold density at the galactic scale .",
    "we note that the parameters for this model are constrained to a good extent by various physical considerations . assuming that the structure is extended down to the infinitely small scale , to avoid a divergence of the total mass , the quantity @xmath42 must be less than unity .",
    "similarly , for a halo with cut - off radius @xmath4 , halo to subhalo distance @xmath11 must be greater than or equal to @xmath43 to avoid any overlap . also note that the density of any subhalo at the cutoff radius @xmath44 scales as @xmath45 .",
    "so , we adopt @xmath46 for further analysis to ensure a constant density at the cutoff radius for all the substructures . in this simplified model",
    ", we have assumed that all the parameters like @xmath11 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 etc .  are identical for all the subhalos for a particular substructure level and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 remain constant for all the levels . in a realistic situation , however , all these parameters may have some random variation . as a result of these fluctuations , the halo mass function , the radial mass distribution , and in turn",
    ", the rotation curves , are expected to be somewhat smoother than that are predicted from this analysis .",
    "a much stronger constraint on the parameters comes from the consideration of the stability of this structures preventing tidal disruption by invoking self - gravity . considering a rigid object of mass @xmath47 and radius @xmath20 at a distance @xmath48 from a bigger object of mass @xmath49 and radius @xmath50 , from the standard roche limit consideration",
    ", @xmath11 should be @xmath51 to avoid tidal disruption of the smaller body . in the case of any halo and its immediate subhalo , @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    "imply @xmath54 .",
    "for even smaller subhalo structures with @xmath55 , the mass is scaled accordingly @xmath56 and @xmath54 assures stability .",
    "hence , a distance @xmath57 will make the whole structure stable .",
    "here @xmath58 is a fudge factor and we use the value of @xmath59 to accommodate non - rigid density clumps . for a given value of @xmath11 ,",
    "the number of substructure @xmath13 is also constrained to be @xmath60 to avoid any possible overlap of subhalo structures .",
    "a detailed virial stability analysis requires numerical simulation of the dynamics of such a density distribution to get the time - averaged dynamical quantities .",
    "but , a simple ensemble average virial scaling analysis may be used to constrain the central density @xmath2 for a set of model parameter . as the whole structure is assumed to have an approximate spherical symmetry , average kinetic and potential energies , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , for thin spherical shells of radius @xmath20 and thickness",
    "@xmath63 will be @xmath64 where @xmath65 is dark matter velocity dispersion , @xmath25 is total mass within radius @xmath20 and @xmath66 is the scale dependent virial velocity equivalent of the `` circular velocity '' for rotating disk .",
    "since the rotation curve has a roughly constant value @xmath67 at large radius , the ratio @xmath68 will tend to the equilibrium value of @xmath69 at large radius if @xmath70 . using the minimum value for @xmath11 from equation  ( [ eq : roche ] )",
    ", the maximum extent of the structure @xmath71 will be @xmath72 and the average density will be @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "note , however , that this is a fractal structure with significant porosity .",
    "so , the average density of any individual clump is higher than @xmath75 by a factor of @xmath76 .",
    "now , for global stability of the whole structure , @xmath71 should be less than or equal to the radius within which the virial equilibrium is maintained .",
    "average density within this virial radius @xmath77 or @xmath78 should be @xmath79 times more than the critical density @xmath80 . for a choice of model parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath81 and @xmath58",
    ", this will constrain the lower limit of the central density @xmath2 so that @xmath82 . for individual substructures , both mass and volume scale as @xmath83 , keeping the average density constant .",
    "this implies that stability for one substructure level ensures stability for all other levels .",
    "since the halo density distribution is significantly clumpy , the velocity field for such a system is also expected to have fluctuations at all scales .",
    "however , due to approximate spherical symmetry of the clump distribution , the average rotation velocity over a spherical shell at radius @xmath20 will still be @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the total mass within this radius . as pointed out in subsection [",
    "sec : virial ] using the virial stability argument , the virial velocity or , equivalently , the `` rotation '' velocity is expected to be approximately same as the local velocity dispersion .",
    "this derived rotation curve for the fractal model is found to be nfw - like at large radial distance . at small radius , by construction , the rotation curve is obviously exactly same as that of a non - singular isothermal halo .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : rotcur ] .",
    "radial distance is scaled by @xmath3 and rotation velocity is scaled by @xmath67 , which is the rotation velocity at the maximum radius plotted .",
    "the black curve is the predicted rotation curve for the fractal substructure model with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath46 and @xmath88 and the red line is the best fit nfw profile to that .",
    "the background density threshold @xmath89 is assumed to be negligible in this model .",
    "rotation curves for non - singular isothermal sphere with and without a cutoff ( green and blue curves respectively ) as well as for nfw halo ( magenta curve ) are also shown in figure  [ fig : rotcur ] for a comparison .",
    "the velocity scaling ensures that the total mass encompassed by the maximum radius is same for all models .",
    "predicted rotation curve for the fractal substructure model ( black ) and the best fit nfw profile to that ( red ) .",
    "this is for @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath46 and @xmath88 .",
    "rotation curves for non - singular isothermal sphere with and without a cutoff ( green and blue curves respectively ) as well as for nfw halo ( magenta curve ) are also shown for a comparison . radial distance and rotation velocity",
    "are scaled by @xmath3 and @xmath67 ( rotation velocity at the furthest radial distance ) respectively.,width=340 ]     predicted rotation curve for the fractal substructure model for different background density threshold @xmath89 .",
    "all other parameters are same as in figure  [ fig : rotcur ] .",
    "different curves are for @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( black , red , green and blue curve respectively).,width=340 ]    the effect of the background density threshold @xmath89 is shown in figure  [ fig : rbgcur ] . here , the rotation curve is evaluated for different @xmath89 keeping all other parameters same as in figure  [ fig : rotcur ] . for scaling ,",
    "we have used the density @xmath44 at the cutoff radius @xmath88 .",
    "different curves in figure  [ fig : rbgcur ] are for @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( black , red , green and blue curve respectively ) .",
    "the general nfw - like nature of the rotation curve and the radial fluctuations remain unchanged . but depending on the value of @xmath89 , rotation curve at large radius may be rising , flat or declining .",
    "note that the derived rotation curves shown in figure  [ fig : rbgcur ] are with the simple model of a constant @xmath89 .",
    "in reality , @xmath89 is expected to be decreasing with increasing @xmath20 , giving rise to a rotation curve somewhat intermediate between the extremes shown in figure  [ fig : rbgcur ] .      the predicted rotation curve due to the clustering of dark matter subhalos is very similar to the observed rotation curve and the empirical nfw rotation curve .",
    "however , unlike the nfw model with a smooth radial density distribution , the present model predicts a significant fluctuation of rotation velocity in both angular and radial directions .",
    "since the underlying density field , which gives rise to this velocity fluctuations , is scale free , the velocity fluctuation power spectrum is expected to be a power law .",
    "though the fractal model has many free parameters , the only relevant parameters for the index of this power law are @xmath13 and @xmath14 while the rest of them will just introduce different multiplicative scaling .",
    "this prediction can be easily verified from high spatial and spectral resolution observation of neutral hydrogen of normal galaxies .",
    "note that part of this fluctuations will cancel out for the spherically averaged rotation curve and hence it is important to use the full velocity field to search for such scale free fluctuations .",
    "it is also important to note that fluctuations of the velocity field of the hydrogen gas will have contributions from the local density perturbations of the disk .",
    "but the scale dependence of these perturbations may makes it possible to disentangle the scale free perturbations due to the halo substructures .",
    "there is some indication of such a power law scaling of the rotation velocity fluctuation power spectra from direct observation and analysis of the h  i 21  cm velocity field of some nearby galaxy @xcite .",
    "we leave a more detailed treatment of this aspect to a future work .",
    "throughout this analysis we have assumed that the clump distribution in this model has an approximate spherical symmetry .",
    "this assumption is most likely to be untrue in reality . due to small count ,",
    "bigger substructures are more likely to cause departure from spherical symmetry .",
    "in this situation , rotation velocity field will also have strong azimuthal asymmetry .",
    "observationally , about half of the spiral galaxies show some degree of kinematical lopsidedness @xcite which may originate from tidal distortion partly due to deviation from spherical symmetry of the underlying gravitational potential of the lopsided dark matter halo @xcite . due to their large number , smaller substructures are likely to have relatively more symmetrical distribution .",
    "so , the velocity fluctuations spectrum is expected to show a power law scaling at large spatial frequency ( large @xmath94 , i.e. , small physical scale ) , and a departure from power law at small @xmath94 .",
    "we have also assumed in this analysis that the baryons will not significantly affect the galactic dynamics . however , some recent numerical studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that the presence of baryons have effects like flattening the central cusp , reducing the halo triaxiality , and introducing bias in clustering with environment density .",
    "effectively , baryon dissipation may destroy the similarity between different scales of clustering .",
    "however , @xcite have found that phenomenon like `` efficient feedback from stellar evolution and the central supermassive black holes '' may counterbalance this effect to some extent . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have found no significant effect of baryonic physics on properties like shape and radial alignment of substructures .",
    "numerical simulations also suggest that , even in the presence of baryons , the subhalo mass function remains a power law though the power law index changes from @xmath95 to @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "it is , hence , important to keep in mind that , in a realistic situation , baryon dissipation may alter the velocity fluctuations causing a significant departure from the scale free velocity fluctuations .",
    "we note that the key result of this analysis , that is an nfw - like rotation curve for the fractal model , is not crucially dependent on the exact density profile of individual halos .",
    "a variety of density profile without any central singularity ( variant of non - singular isothermal sphere ) will leads to a similar nfw - like rotation curve .",
    "this strongly suggests that the clustering properties of the dark matter particles dominantly govern the radial density profile of the halo .",
    "finally , these assembly of substructures will give rise to a flat nfw - like rotation curve for normal galaxies .",
    "but , for more dark matter dominated low mass dwarf galaxies and low surface brightness galaxies , depending on the exact form of the non - singular density profile , the dominant contribution of the central big halo may make the rotation curve for such galaxies intrinsically different which is consistent with observational results @xcite .",
    "1 .   the dark matter halo substructures at galactic scale is found to significantly affect the rotation curve .",
    "2 .   a self - consistent model of statistically self - similar hierarchical dark matter substructures predicts an nfw - like rotation curve , though each clump has a non - singular isothermal density profile .",
    "this nfw - like rotation curve emerges out of the fractal geometry and is independent of specific density profile of individual clumps .",
    "the model predicts a scale free power spectrum of the rotation velocity fluctuations which can be observationally verified .",
    "the model also provides some plausible explanation of the observed intrinsic difference between the dark matter halo density profile of normal galaxies and dark matter dominated low mass dwarf galaxies and low surface brightness galaxies .",

    "<S> the effect of halo substructures on galaxy rotation curves is investigated in this paper using a simple model of dark matter clustering . </S>",
    "<S> a dark matter halo density profile is developed based only on the scale free nature of clustering that leads to a statistically self - similar distribution of the substructures at galactic scale . </S>",
    "<S> semi - analytical method is used to derive rotation curves for such a clumpy dark matter density profile . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the halo substructures significantly affect the galaxy velocity field . </S>",
    "<S> based on the fractal geometry of the halo , this self - consistent model predicts an nfw - like rotation curve and a scale free power spectrum of the rotation velocity fluctuations . </S>"
