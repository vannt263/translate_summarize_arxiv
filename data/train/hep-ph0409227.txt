    "although most of the popular supersymmetric models are linear ones , it is still an open question whether supersymmetry is realized in nature in linear or nonlinear way @xcite .",
    "one of us have considered a nonlinear realization of supersymmetry with su(2 ) @xmath0 u(1 ) symmetry some years ago @xcite .",
    "this model requires at least two higgs doublets and a singlet for its higgs sector .",
    "thus , at least with respect to the higgs sector , this nonlinear model may be regarded as an alternative to the linear next - to minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) .",
    "analysis of this nonlinear model show that it is consistent with phenomenology @xcite .",
    "an unfavorable aspect of the nmssm is that its higgs sector is larger than the simplest linear supersymmetric model , the well - known minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which has just two higgs doublets .",
    "the nonlinear alternative that has the same higgs sector as the mssm is the minimal nonlinear supersymmetric su(5 ) model @xcite .",
    "the higgs potential of the low energy limit of this nonlinear model needs effectively only two higgs doublets .",
    "this model has been investigated in some detail by us @xcite .",
    "however , this minimal nonlinear supersymmetric su(5 ) model has a disadvantage compared to the mssm .",
    "that is , it has one more parameter than the mssm : the higgs sector of this nonlinear model at the electroweak scale is determined by two higgs doublets , and the higgs potential in terms of these higgs doublets contains in general three mass parameters .",
    "these mass parameters are essentially free at the electroweak scale .",
    "they are completely independent . on the other hand ,",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm has just two independent parameters .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to look for arguments which allow us to remove this disadvantage , that is , to reduce the number of independent parameters .",
    "one of the possibility is given by the _ freedom of fine tuning _",
    ", that is , to impose some constraints on the mass parameters at the gut scale . if they are constrained at the gut scale , their values at the electroweak scale would no longer be free but determined by the renormalization group ( rg ) equations that govern their evolutions as functions of energy scale .    in this article",
    ", we investigate the phenomenological implications of imposing constraints on the mass parameters in the higgs potential of the minimal nonlinear supersymmetric su(5 ) model . by considering a number of simple constraints , which are in fact analogous to the various constrained versions of the mssm",
    ", we examine the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson , as well as other higgs bosons , and their production cross sections in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "we find that some of the constraints yield unphysical results or phenomenologically unacceptable results whereas others give results that are consistent with the present experimental data .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in the next section , we describe the argument for the possibility of imposing constraints on the mass parameters . in section 3 , we review the results of unconstrained higgs potential . in section 4 , we consider a number of constraints in the increasing order of complexity . among them",
    "we investigate three particular cases which are phenomenologically interesting .",
    "concluding discussions are given in the last section .",
    "a peculiar aspect of the minimal nonlinear sypersymmetric su(5 ) model in its spontaneous symmetry breaking from su(5 ) to su(3)@xmath0u(1 ) is the necessity of _ manifold fine tuning _ in the following sense : in the conventional su(5 ) model the spontaneous symmetry breaking of su(5 ) to su(3)@xmath0u(1 ) is induced by the following vacuum expectation values of the diagonal elements of the adjoint higgs multiplet @xmath2 @xmath3 where only one fine tuning parameter , @xmath4 , is introduced , which is of order @xmath5 gev , and @xmath6 is of order @xmath7 gev .    in case of the minimal nonlinear supersymmetric",
    "su(5 ) model , one needs to introduce three fine tuning parameters such that the vacuum expectation value of @xmath2 is given by @xmath8 where all of the three fine tuning parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are of order @xmath5 .",
    "as they satisfy @xmath12 , only two of them are independent .",
    "we need fine tune them . in the sense that the minimal nonlinear supersymmetric su(5 ) model needs one more free fine tuning parameter than the conventional su(5 ) model , it might be said that the former is less natural than the latter , as far as the fine tuning is considered to be unnatural .",
    "however , a remarkable merit of the minimal nonlinear supersymmetric su(5 ) model is that there is a theoretically consistent method to break su(5 ) to su(3)@xmath0u(1 ) with no need of fine tuning .",
    "unfortunately , the result of the low energy limit of the minimal nonlinear supersymmetric su(5 ) model without fine tuning seems to be incompatible with existing experimental data , which will be discussed shortly .",
    "the higgs potential of the minimal nonlinear supersymmetric su(5 ) model , after the breaking of su(5 ) all the way down to su(3)@xmath0u(1 ) , in the low energy limit at the electroweak scale is given at the tree level by @xcite @xmath13 where three mass parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are introduced .",
    "these mass parameters are expressed as @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , where @xmath19 is of the same order of @xmath7 gev as @xmath6 , and the dimensionless parameter @xmath20 is of order of unity .",
    "generally , both @xmath6 and @xmath19 have to be fine tuned such that the difference @xmath21 should be of order of electroweak scale in order to make the model suitable for the electroweak phenomenology .",
    "it turns out in the minimal supersymmetric su(5 ) model that one can obtain without fine tuning the mass parameters a theoretically consistent model as a low energy limit by breaking first su(5 ) to su(3)@xmath0su(2)@xmath0u(1 ) and then breaking dynamically su(3)@xmath0su(2)@xmath0u(1 ) to su(3)@xmath0u(1 ) .",
    "first , the breaking of su(5 ) to su(3)@xmath0su(2)@xmath0u(1 ) can be , as shown in ref @xcite , accomplished by the vacuum expectation values of the quintuplets @xmath22 and @xmath23 as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , and the vacuum expectation value of @xmath2 given independently of @xmath26 as @xmath27 the extremum conditions with respect to @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 then imply that the three mass parameters in the above tree - level higgs potential are all zero : @xmath31 .    now , for the higgs potential with @xmath32 , if @xmath33 , su(3)@xmath0su(2)@xmath0u(1 ) is spontaneously broken to su(3)@xmath0u(1 ) at the tree level . if , on the other hand , @xmath34 , it is not possible for su(3)@xmath0su(2)@xmath0u(1 ) to be spontaneously broken at the tree level but only possible at the one - loop level .",
    "the parameters are evolved from the gut scale to the electraoweak scale via the rg equations given in appendix a. we carry out the calculation in the frame of one - loop effective potential given in appendix b. the renormalization scale is taken to be between 100 gev and 500 gev .",
    "it turns out that all loop contributions should be included : @xmath35 and @xmath36 quark , gauge bosons , and scalar higgs bosons , where the masses of @xmath35 and @xmath36 quark , and the neutral gauge boson are taken as @xmath37 gev , @xmath38 gev , and @xmath39 gev , respectively .",
    "prior to the extremum conditions with respect to @xmath40 and @xmath41 are imposed , the higgs potential has two independent parameters , namely , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . after imposing the two extremum conditions ,",
    "no free parameters are left in the higgs potential .",
    "therefore , the higgs potential contains no parameter ; it may be called zero - parameter model .",
    "for example the higgs boson masses are uniquely fixed .",
    "for @xmath44 we obtain 35 gev .    in order to examine whether it is possible for these higgs bosons to escape from experimental detection ,",
    "the production cross sections of @xmath45 in @xmath1 collisions are calculated .",
    "the relevant production channels are @xmath46 for @xmath47 gev , we obtain @xmath48 pb , which is much larger than 1 pb , the discovery limit of lep1 .",
    "therefore , this zero - parameter model is phenomenologically incompatible with the lep1 data , although it is theoretically interesting in the sense that no fine tuning is required .",
    "in this section , we summarize the results of unconstrained higgs potential , where the three mass parameters may have arbitrary values at the gut scale , in order to demonstrate the effects of the constraints @xcite .    the higgs potential of the minimal nonlinear supersymmetric su(5 ) model contains three mass parameters , @xmath49 ( @xmath18 ) . in general , the three mass parameters @xmath17 may take any value between zero and say of order 1000 gev . if we do not use the _ freedom of fine tuning _ , the three mass parameters are not constrained . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the phenomenology of this unconstrained model has been treated at the tree level . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the analysis has been extended to the one - loop level in the frame of effective potential method , where rg equations have not been used and only top and bottom contributions have been taken into account . in ref .",

    "the relevant channels are the same as eq .",
    "( [ productionchannel ] ) . as no scalar higgs boson has discovered at lep , it might have escaped the detection or its mass is bounded from below . for @xmath61 gev , which is the center of mass energy",
    "reached finally at lep2 , assuming the discovery limit of 40fb for lep2 , we find that @xmath45 should be heavier than 66 gev in order to escape the detection at lep2 .",
    "future @xmath1 colliders may discover the higgs bosons of this unconstrained model . assuming that at least 10 signal events are necessary to detect the higgs bosons",
    ", we set the necessary minimum luminosity @xmath62 for given center of mass energy of the future @xmath1 colliders : for the @xmath45 production , we find that @xmath62 is respectively 1.43 fb@xmath63 , 5.4 fb@xmath63 , and 21.3 fb@xmath63 for @xmath64 , 1000 , and 2000 gev . for the @xmath65 production , we obtain that @xmath66 fb@xmath63 for @xmath67 gev , and for the @xmath59 production , @xmath68 fb@xmath63 for @xmath67 gev .",
    "an integrated luminosity of this order for the future linear collider is sufficiently realistic , as the proposed linear collider project suggests that the baseline luminosity for the @xmath64 gev @xmath1 linear collider is above 10@xmath69 @xmath70s@xmath63 @xcite .",
    "now , let us use the _ freedom of fine tuning _ at the gut scale",
    ". the simplest form of fine tuning the mass parameters would be such that the number of them is reduced .",
    "in other words , we eliminate some of the mass parameters by fine tuning them . for example",
    ", we may eliminate all of them by tuning @xmath71 , or two of them by setting either @xmath72 but @xmath73 , @xmath74 but @xmath75 , or @xmath76 but @xmath77 , and so on .",
    "we find that among them , three cases of fine tunings yield phenomenologically reasonable results : @xmath78 we consider these three cases one by one . note that we take @xmath79 at the gut scale for our analysis and @xmath80 for the mass parameters .",
    "the other values we take in our calculations at the electroweak scale are @xmath37 gev , @xmath38 gev , and @xmath39 gev , and @xmath55 .      * case a *    in case a , there are two independent mass parameters .",
    "we fine tune at the gut scale one of the mass parameters to be zero , and let the other two mass parameters vary independently",
    ". from the gut scale where we set @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath79 , the rg equations lead us at the electroweak scale to @xmath84 with these allowed parameters , we calculate the higgs boson masses at the electroweak scale .",
    "we plot @xmath44 in fig .",
    "[ a-1 ] , where one can see that points are scattered between 104.6 gev and 183.4 gev for @xmath44 . in this way , we set the ranges for the higgs boson masses .",

    "the allowed range for @xmath44 is rather tight compared to the allowed ranges for @xmath87 or @xmath57 .",
    "now , the cross sections for the productions of these higgs bosons are calculated in order to check the possibility of detecting these higgs bosons in @xmath1 collisions . for @xmath88 gev ,",
    "the center of mass energy of lep2 , the results of our calculations show that the production cross sections for all these higgs bosons are well below the discovery limit of lep2 .",
    "thus , in case a , the existing experimental data can not put any constraints on the masses of the three higgs bosons in the minimal nonlinear supersymmetric su(5 ) model .",
    "the cross sections for the productions of these higgs bosons at the future @xmath1 linear colliders are also calculated . for @xmath45 , we plot in fig.[a-500-s1 ] @xmath89 for its production in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath64 gev .",
    "one can see that @xmath89 lies between about 7 and 9.8 fb .",
    "we also calculate for other center of mass energies .",
    "thus , the results for @xmath45 production in @xmath1 collisions for @xmath64 ( 1000 , 2000 ) gev are @xmath90    the lower bounds for @xmath91 and @xmath92 are nearly zero in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath64 gev .",

    "both @xmath65 and @xmath59 might be produced heftily .",
    "the production cross sections for both of them are obtained as @xmath96 for @xmath95 gev .",

    "so the no detection at lep1 of @xmath45 may put a lower bound on @xmath44 as @xmath102    if the @xmath1 center of mass energy is as large as the lep2 , all the three higgs bosons can be produced . here ,",
    "too , the production of @xmath59 is strongly suppressed by the same reason as given at lep1 .",

    "thus , lep2 can not put any limit on @xmath87 .    in @xmath1 collisions with very high center of mass energy",
    ", the channel ( iv ) in equation ( [ productionchannel ] ) is comparably dominant with other channels in size and @xmath92 becomes the same order of magnitude as @xmath89 and @xmath91 .",
    "we allow the parameters to vary within the ranges obtained by the rg equations , and calculate the production cross sections .",
    "we obtain the following lower bounds for them : for @xmath1 collisions with @xmath64 gev , @xmath104 for @xmath1 collisions with @xmath95 gev , @xmath105 and for @xmath1 collisions with @xmath67 gev , @xmath106      let us consider the case c. the higgs potential in the case c contains only one mass parameter at the gut scale , namely , latexmath:[$0 < |m^2_{1_{\\rm",

    ". [ c - lep206-ms1 ] , we plot the result as a function of @xmath44 . assuming the discovery limit of 40fb for lep2 , fig .",
    "[ c - lep206-ms1 ] indicates that there are some parameter regions for @xmath110 gev where @xmath45 might be detected at lep2 .",
    "thus , the figure suggests that the lower bound on the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson in our model is set as 107.3 gev by lep2 .    in the future @xmath1 linear colliders",
    "the cross section for the production of the lightest scalar higgs boson @xmath45 in this case is @xmath111 for @xmath64 ( 1000 , 2000 ) gev . for other higgs bosons ,",
    "we obtain that @xmath112 for @xmath64 ( 1000 , 2000 ) gev .",
    "the tendency is that the cross sections decrease as the higgs bosons become heavier and the cross sections increase as the higgs bosons become lighter . for @xmath65 and @xmath59 ,",
    "the minimum cross section for producing them at a @xmath64 gev @xmath1 colliding machine is nearly zero .",
    "however , the large upper bounds on the production cross sections suggest that they might also be detected at the future @xmath1 linear colliders depending on their masses .",
    "note that these numbers are large enough for the future @xmath1 linear colliders to examine the case c of the minimal nonlinear supersymmetric su(5 ) model .",
    "thus , if the discovery limit for the @xmath1 linear colliders at @xmath64 gev is 10 events , one would need an integrated luminosity of at least about 1.33 fb@xmath63 . in order to test the model by detecting , for example , @xmath45 , the minimum cross section of whose production is about 7.5 fb .",
    "we have investigated if the minimal nonlinear supersymmetric su(5 ) model is phenomenologically viable , by fine - tuning the mass parameters of the higgs potential .",
    "we have set some of the mass parameters to be constrained at the gut scale , and then have evolved them down to the electroweak scale via rg equations .",
    "we have found that three cases emerge as acceptable .",
    "one of them is the case where @xmath15 , the mass term of the higgs doublet @xmath113 , which gives mass to the top - quark , is set to be zero at the gut scale .",
    "a characteristic feature of this case is that the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson is predicted as 104.6 @xmath114 183.4 .",
    "note that the lower bound of @xmath44 is rather large while the allowed range of @xmath44 is comparatively narrow .",
    "another case is obtained by fine - tuning @xmath14 , the mass term of the doublet @xmath115 , which gives mass to the bottom - quark , to be zero at the gut scale .",
    "a novel feature of this case is that all scalar higgs bosons are predicted to be lighter than 200 gev .",
    "the other case has only one mass parameter at the gut scale .",
    "it is obtained by fine - tuning @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 to be equal non - zero value at the gut scale . in this case , all scalar higgs bosons are predicted to be between 85 gev and 345 gev .",
    "we have also shown that these three cases are compatible with the data of lep1 and lep2 .",
    "we have calculated the lower bounds for the production cross sections of some higgs bosons at the future @xmath1 colliders with @xmath64 , 1000 , and 2000 gev .",
