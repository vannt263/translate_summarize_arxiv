    "<S> controlling fluid droplets efficiently in the microscale is of great interest both from a basic science and a technology perspective . we have designed and developed a general - purpose , highly scalable microfluidic control strategy through a single global clock signal that enables synchronous control of arbitrary number of droplets in a planar geometry . </S>",
    "<S> a rotating precessive magnetic field provides a global clock signal , enabling simultaneous control of droplet position , velocity and trajectories . here , in this fluid dynamics video , we explain the main physics of this new microfluidic concept . </S>",
    "<S> video data from droplets moving in sync in different fluidic circuits are included . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental setup is described and video data is analyzed to provide a detailed view of the time - dynamics of propagating droplets . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we explore the operational limits of this concept , scaling and phase diagram with physical regime diagram . </S>"
