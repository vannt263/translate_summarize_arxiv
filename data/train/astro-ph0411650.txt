    "as the largest and latest virialised structures to form , galaxy clusters are especially useful cosmological probes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "next generation cluster cosmology surveys , such as the xcs @xcite , will detect sufficiently large numbers of clusters that uncertainties in values of cosmological parameters will be mainly systematic , requiring for example an accurate calibration between cluster x - ray temperature and mass .",
    "such measurements demand an improved understanding of cluster physics , therefore realistic numerical simulations of the cluster population are essential .",
    "in this paper we present a preliminary analysis of the @xmath3 cluster population within the clef hydrodynamics simulation , a large state - of - the - art cosmological simulation that , besides gravity and gas dynamics , includes a model for the effects of galaxy formation .",
    "as we will show , the simulation does a reasonably good job at reproducing x - ray scaling relations at @xmath3 .",
    "the clef ( cluster evolution and formation ) hydrodynamics simulation ( see fig  [ fig : image ] ) is a large simulation of structure formation within the @xmath4cdm cosmology , with the following cosmological parameters : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "these values are in good agreement with recent analyses @xcite .",
    "initial conditions were generated using a modified version of the cosmic software package provided with the hydra code @xcite .",
    "the appropriate transfer function , generated using cmbfast @xcite , was read in and a displacement field generated for a @xmath1 comoving box at @xmath10 .",
    "two regular cubic grids of @xmath11 particles , separated by half the interparticle distance in each of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 directions , were then perturbed by these displacements to create the initial particle positions .",
    "thus , the gas and dark matter particle masses were set to @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .    this initial configuration",
    "was then evolved to @xmath3 using version 2 of the gadget code @xcite , a hybrid particle - mesh / tree gravity solver with a version of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) that explicitly conserves entropy where appropriate .",
    "in addition , the gas could cool radiatively , assuming a fixed metallicity of @xmath16 . cooled gas , with @xmath17 and @xmath18k , could either form stars if @xmath19 or be reheated by stars if @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a random number drawn for each particle from the unit interval and @xmath22 is the reheated mass fraction parameter .",
    "each reheated gas particle was given a fixed amount of entropy , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , which further heats the icm as the particle does work on its surroundings .",
    "further details may be found in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we concentrate on comparing a selection of simulated and observed x - ray cluster scaling relations at @xmath3 .",
    "clusters were identified by first identifying local maxima in the density field and growing spheres around these maxima until the average density within each sphere was a fixed factor , @xmath25 , above the critical density , @xmath26 .",
    "values of @xmath25 used will be given in each subsection .",
    "for the virial density ( @xmath27 ) there are @xmath28 clusters with @xmath29 kev ( @xmath30 above 3 kev ) .",
    "we begin by showing in fig .",
    "[ fig : tm2500 ] the relation between hot gas mass - weighted temperature ( @xmath31 , where the sum is over all gas particles with @xmath32k ) and total mass for a density contrast @xmath33 . all clusters with @xmath34",
    "are considered .",
    "the dashed line is a best - fit relation to the clusters for a fixed slope of 2/3 , as expected if the clusters form a self - similar population .",
    "this relation is @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "when the slope is allowed to vary , the best - fit relation ( solid line ) is @xmath37 close to the self - similar relation .",
    "the thick band is the observed relation derived by @xcite , in good agreement with our results .",
    "it is more common in the literature for observed temperature - mass relations to be presented at larger radii , using spectroscopic ( photon - weighted ) temperatures and mass estimates assuming @xmath38-model surface brightness profiles and polytropic - model temperature profiles ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these results generally suggest a slope closer to 1/2 than 2/3 , attributed to non - gravitational processes ( see below ) , and a normalisation that is offset in mass from simulation predictions by @xmath3940 per cent .",
    "examining , for example , the x - ray emission - weighted temperature - mass relation from our simulation at @xmath40 , @xmath41 [ @xmath42 , where @xmath4 is an energy - dependent cooling function ] , we find a similar slope to the observations ( 0.53 ) but an offset in normalisation comparable to previous simulations .",
    "the cause of this offset is likely due to incorrect estimates of cluster masses ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and is something we will return to in a future paper .",
    "galaxy formation increases the entropy of intracluster gas , producing a relationship with temperature that is flatter than the self - similar scaling ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we plot this relation in fig .",
    "[ fig : st ] , again using an x - ray emission - weighted temperature for each cluster .",
    "two radii are considered ( @xmath44 and @xmath40 ) and only clusters with @xmath45kev are studied . again , the simulated clusters are in reasonably good agreement with the observations @xcite , containing an excess of entropy that is larger in smaller systems . for @xmath44 @xmath46 and for @xmath40 @xmath47      finally , we show bolometric x - ray luminosity versus x - ray emission - weighted temperature in fig .  [",
    "fig : lt ] .",
    "again , only clusters with @xmath45kev are considered .",
    "symbols with errors are observational data from @xcite and @xcite . to remain approximately consistent with this data , emission from within @xmath48 of our simulated cluster centres is omitted .",
    "the dashed line is a best - fit relation for a fixed slope equal to 2 ( self - similar ) , clearly a poor fit to the observations . when the slope is allowed to vary , the best - fit relation ( solid line ) is @xmath49 where @xmath50 , considerably steeper than the self - similar case .",
    "in fact , the simulated relation is not adequately described by a power law since the local gradient becomes progressively flatter with increasing temperature .",
    "fitting clusters with @xmath51kev ( dot - dashed line ) yields @xmath52 in reasonable agreement with the observations although the normalisation is a bit too high .",
    "better agreement was reached by @xcite , who used a slightly smaller gas fraction ( 0.15 rather than 0.162 used here , which is a closer match to the value ) .",
    "it is likely however that fine tuning of the feedback model parameters would improve the agreement between the simulated and observed relations .",
