    "among the most challenging questions for high energy physics research during the next decades is the origin and stabilization of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking in particle physics and the nature of dark matter and baryogenesis in cosmology .",
    "both aspects suggest the existence of new symmetries within the reach of the next generation of colliders , thereby highlighting an interface between particle physics and cosmology .",
    "the existence of dark matter in the universe has been firmly established by various experiments .",
    "recently the dark matter abundance has been precisely determined by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , in agreement with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , @xmath6 at the 95% c.l . here",
    "@xmath7 is the ratio of the dark matter energy density to the critical density @xmath8 , where @xmath9 km / s / mpc is the hubble constant and @xmath10 is newton s constant .",
    "one of the most attractive possibilities to explain the nature of dark matter is the existence of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which are stable due to an additional new symmetry .",
    "moreover , the generation of the baryon - antibaryon - asymmetry ( baryogenesis ) in the universe also demands the introduction of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "any mechanism for baryogenesis must fulfill the three sakharov conditions @xcite : ( i ) the existence of baryon number violating processes , ( ii ) cp violation and ( iii ) a departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "although the three conditions are fulfilled in the standard model , the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis is ruled out .",
    "baryon number violation arises in the standard model and extensions thereof in the form of non - perturbative sphaleron processes .",
    "out - of - equilibrium transitions can occur at the electroweak phase transition if it is sufficiently strongly first order , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the higgs vacuum expectation value at the critical temperature @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a first - order phase transition can be induced by loop contributions of light bosonic particles to the finite temperature higgs potential , but in the standard model the contribution of the gauge bosons is too small to allow for @xmath11 while obeying the higgs mass bound from lep @xcite .",
    "in addition , cp violation in the standard model through the phase in the ckm quark mixing matrix is not sufficient to explain the baryon asymmetry in the universe @xcite .",
    "one of the most compelling theories for physics beyond the standard model is supersymmetry , which stabilizes the difference between the scale of electroweak physics , @xmath14 gev , and the scale of grand unified theories ( guts ) , @xmath15 gev .",
    "the hierarchy stabilization suggests that the masses of the supersymmetric partners of the standard model particles are near the tev scale , within reach of the next generation of colliders . in the presence of @xmath16-parity , which assigns @xmath17 to standard model particles and @xmath18 to their supersymmetric partners ,",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable and provides a natural dark matter candidate .    in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm )",
    ", the superpartners of the top quark , the scalar top quarks ( stops ) , have an important impact on the higgs potential @xcite .",
    "loop effects of light stops can induce a strongly first order electroweak phase transition , thus generating the out - of - equilibrium condition for electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "in addition , supersymmetric models offer new sources of cp violation to explain the magnitude of the baryon asymmetry .    to open the window for electroweak baryogenesis , the lightest stop mass is required to be smaller than the top quark mass , whereas the higgs boson involved in the electroweak phase transition must be lighter than about 120 gev @xcite .",
    "hence there is an interesting region of parameter space for which the light stop is only slightly heavier than the neutralino lsp , thus implying that the stop - neutralino co - annihilation process becomes significant . in the stop - neutralino co - annihilation region",
    "consistent with the measured dark matter value , the mass difference between the light stop and the lightest neutralino is smaller than about 30 gev @xcite .",
    "the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments will be able to probe a light higgs boson with standard - model - like couplings to the gauge bosons , as required by electroweak baryogenesis , but the stop parameter region compatible with dark matter is very difficult to explore at hadron colliders .",
    "preliminary studies for the tevatron show that with 24 fb@xmath19 of integrated luminosity , stops with masses up to about 170 gev may be detected if the stop - neutralino mass difference is larger than 3050 gev @xcite .",
    "smaller mass differences can not be covered due to the reliance on a trigger for the signature of missing transverse energy .",
    "so far , no dedicated studies for light stop exist for the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "however , limitations due to background levels and detector thresholds will be even more severe at the lhc than at the tevatron , with same - sign leptonic tagging of the top quarks , might offer additional prospect for studying stops for small mass differences .",
    "this channel is currently under study . ] .",
    "a future international @xmath20 linear collider ( ilc ) provides a clean environment with relatively small background levels that allows the study of stops for small stop - neutralino mass differences .",
    "for instance , the large electron - positron collider ( lep ) was able to set limits on the stops even for a mass difference to the neutralino close to 1  gev  @xcite .",
    "based on the experience from lep , the ilc might be able to explore mass differences down to a few gev even for stop masses comparable with the top quark mass . in the region of parameters where stop - neutralino co - annihilation leads to a value of the relic density consistent with experimental results , the stop - neutralino mass difference is never much smaller than 15  gev , and hence an ilc seems well suited to explore this region efficiently .",
    "in addition to establishing the existence of light stop quarks , the precise measurement of their properties is crucial for testing their impact on the dark matter relic abundance and the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "the relevance of a linear collider to probe mssm baryogenesis through the chargino sector have been discussed in ref .",
    "a linear collider provides an excellent environment to perform precise measurements of the stop @xcite and chargino systems  @xcite .    in this work",
    "it is shown that the ilc offers a unique possibility to elucidate the scenario of light stop quarks and its cosmological implications .",
    "the capabilities of the ilc for searching stops with small stop - neutralino mass differences is investigated in detail , including realistic detector simulations .",
    "it is studied to which accuracy the stop mass , mixing angle and stop - neutralino mass difference can be determined at the ilc , also under the presence of potential cp phases .",
    "this involves the analysis of the decay spectra and production cross - sections for different beam polarizations . from the expected accuracies at the ilc",
    ", we will furthermore explore how precisely the contribution of stop co - annihilation to the dark matter relic density can be computed .",
    "after introducing the relevant notations and theoretical constraints and assumptions for the light stop scenario in section  [ sec : not ] , an experimental study for stop searches at the linear collider is presented in section  [ sec : stop ] .",
    "section  [ sec : param ] analyzes the achievable precision for the determination of the underlying supersymmetric parameters , which is used in section  [ sec : dm ] to derive the expected accuracy for the computation of the dark matter density from linear collider measurements .",
    "the final conclusions are given in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "this work is restricted to the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , including cp - violating phases in the supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "since the yukawa couplings of the first two generations are very small , mixing between the l- and r - sfermions , partners of the left- and right - handed fermions , of the first two generations can be neglected . for the supersymmetric partners of the top quark , the scalar top quark ( stop ) , on the other hand ,",
    "mixing effects are very important .",
    "the stop mass matrix is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the left- and right - chiral stop supersymmetry breaking masses , respectively , @xmath25 is the trilinear stop soft breaking parameter and @xmath26 is the higgs / higgsino parameter in the superpotential .",
    "diagonalization of the stop mass matrix yields the mass eigenvalues @xmath27,\\ ] ] and the mixing angle @xmath28 in this work , inter - generational ( ckm ) mixing effects for fermions and sfermions are neglected .",
    "apart from the electroweak parameters , the spectrum of the charginos and neutralinos is described by the higgs / higgsino parameter @xmath26 and the soft su(2 ) and u(1 ) gaugino parameters , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . in the wino - higgsino basis ,",
    "the chargino mass matrix reads @xmath31 the mass eigenvalues and the mixing angles for the left- and right - chiral chargino components are obtained according to @xcite @xmath32 with @xmath33    the neutralino mass term in the current eigen - basis is given by @xmath34 with the symmetric mass matrix @xmath35 in which the abbreviations @xmath36 and @xmath37 have been introduced ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the sine and cosine of the electroweak mixing angle .",
    "the transition to the mass eigen - basis is performed by the unitary mixing matrix @xmath40 , @xmath41 explicit analytical solutions for the mixing matrices can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite used in ref .",
    "@xcite is different from eq .  .",
    "] .    in the mssm higgs sector , the tree - level masses of the cp - even neutral higgs bosons @xmath42 and @xmath43 and the charged scalar @xmath44 can be expressed through the gauge boson masses , the mass of the pseudo - scalar higgs boson , @xmath45 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the born relations are however significantly modified by radiative corrections , with dominant effects originating from top and stop loops .    in the mssm",
    "the higgs mass is very sensitive to the stop spectrum . in order to be consistent with the bound @xmath46 from direct searches at lep @xcite and with one light stop state , the heavier stop mass has to be above about 1 tev and the trilinear coupling @xmath47 has to be sizable @xcite .",
    "constraints from electroweak precision data are satisfied when the light stop is mainly right - chiral .",
    "this is naturally achieved for values of the stop supersymmetry breaking parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the stop mixing parameter @xmath50 is bounded from below by the higgs boson mass constraint from lep and from above by the requirement of the strength of the first order electroweak phase transition , leaving the allowed range @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the lower bound is weakened for large values of @xmath23 of several tev .",
    "the mssm higgs masses with cp violation have been calculated including complete one - loop and leading two - loop corrections , see _",
    "e.g. _ ref .  @xcite . in this work , however , the process of baryogenesis at the electroweak phase transition is computed with the program of refs .",
    "@xcite , which includes only one - loop corrections to the zero temperature higgs potential .",
    "since the allowed mass range for the higgs boson is constrained by the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis , for consistency the higgs mass is determined by the minimization of the one - loop effective potential .",
    "this implies that only one - loop corrections are included in the calculation of the higgs mass as well .    for successful electroweak baryogenesis",
    ", an additional source of cp violation beyond the standard model ckm matrix is necessary . within the mssm",
    ", the dominant source are chargino loops , with a contribution proportional to @xmath52 @xcite . to generate a sufficiently large baryon asymmetry , the charginos are required to be relatively light , @xmath53 . in addition",
    ", the cp - violating phase needs to be sizable , @xmath54 @xcite .    a very large cp - violating phase , on the other hand ,",
    "is restricted by experimental bounds on the electric dipole moments of the electron , neutron and @xmath55hg nucleus .",
    "the leading contributions from one - loop sfermion - gaugino loops @xcite become small for large masses of the first two generation sfermions of several tev .",
    "furthermore , cp - violating phases in the sfermion @xmath56-parameters can result in cancellations for the electric dipole moments @xcite , without having much effect on electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "for the present work , the strongest constraint arises from the bound on the electric dipole moment of the electron , @xmath57  cm @xcite , effectively restricting the allowed mssm parameter space .",
    "a cp - violating phase in @xmath29 can always be transferred into the @xmath26 parameter by means of a unitary transformation . in principle",
    ", there can also be non - trivial phases in the gaugino parameters @xmath30 and @xmath58 , but their effect on electroweak baryogenesis is small .",
    "therefore in the following all gaugino soft parameters are assumed real , while the generation of the baryon asymmetry is connected with a phase in the @xmath26 parameter , @xmath59 for simplicity , this report will only investigate scenarios where the lightest neutralino is bino - like , _ i.e. _ @xmath60 and the annihilation cross - section is importantly enhanced through co - annihilation with the stop . for small values of @xmath26 , the lsp can acquire a significant higgsino component , which increases the annihilation via s - channel @xmath61 and higgs boson exchange .",
    "this case will be considered elsewhere .",
    "for small mass differences @xmath62 , the dominant decay mode of the light stop quark , @xmath63 , is into a charm quark and the lightest neutralino , @xmath64 . in the parameter region where the co - annihilation mechanism becomes efficient ,",
    "the typical mass differences are @xmath65 gev .",
    "thus the two- and three - body decay modes @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are kinematically forbidden , since the sneutrino and chargino are assumed to be heavier than the light stop .",
    "since the decay @xmath64 occurs only at one - loop order , it is formally of the same order @xmath70 as the four - body decay @xmath71 .",
    "however , the decay into a charm quark is sensitive to the supersymmetric flavor structure at the supersymmetry breaking scale @xcite . for models with high - scale supersymmetry breaking ,",
    "this therefore introduces a large enhancement factor for this process . in the following it",
    "is assumed that the branching ratio for @xmath64 is 100% .    in this section",

    "all processes are simulated including beamstrahlung for cold ilc technology as parameterized in the program circe 1.0 @xcite .",
    "the effect of beamstrahlung is twofold .",
    "firstly , due to electromagnetic interactions between the two densely charged incoming bunches , a spread of the @xmath81 beam energy spectra is generated .",
    "on the other hand , these electromagnetic interactions result in the radiation of ( typically soft ) photons that can interact and lead to two - photon events in addition to the normal two - photon background mentioned above . in table  [",

    "if the stop is very light and the light chargino can decay into the stop and a bottom quark , @xmath82 , the largest supersymmetric background comes from chargino pair production .",
    "although this process has a four - jet signature with two b - quark jets and two c - quark jets , a fraction of events with overlapping jets can be a relevant background to stop pair production , since the chargino production cross - section is typically large , of the order of 1 pb . the contribution of this background will be addressed later in this section .",

    "_ [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : points ]    the points a , c and f give a dark matter density in good agreement with current astrophysical observations . here",
    "the scenario c is identical with the one introduced in the appendix .",
    "the point d is marginally consistent with the wmap constraints , while the points b and e result in a dark matter density below and above , respectively , the wmap measurement by more than the 95% confidence level .    performing the analysis of experimental uncertainties as explained in the previous section for each of the points in table  [ tab : points ] leads to the results shown in fig  [ fig : dm2 ] .",
    "[ fig : dm2 ]    as evident from the figure , the linear collider measurements constrain the computed dark matter relic density with a precision comparable to the current direct astrophysical observation .",
    "for the points a , c and f this would indicate strong evidence that supersymmetry with a lsp neutralino and a light stop contributing to the co - annihilation mechanism is the source of dark matter in the universe .    in case of scenario d , the linear collider data would restrict the dark matter abundance to @xmath85 within 1@xmath86 experimental errors .",
    "while this result would still be consistent with the current astrophysical result @xmath87 from wmap , it imposes constraints on the supersymmetric parameter space . under the assumption that our understanding of the cosmological evolution is correct",
    ", the @xmath88 mass is for example required to be less than about 130 gev .",
    "for point e , the deduced neutralino dark matter density turns out to be too large compared to the wmap result by roughly two standard deviations .",
    "this could be due to other particles contributing to increase the total dark matter annihilation cross - section .",
    "it can also be interpreted as evidence that our current theoretical understanding of the evolution of the universe needed to be revised . on the other hand ,",
    "scenario b leads to a dark matter density that is smaller than the wmap result by about two standard deviations .",
    "this discrepancy could be explained by the existence of another source for cold dark matter or , as before , might put our description of cosmological evolution into question .",
    "the mssm with light scalar top quarks provides a framework for simultaneously explaining electroweak baryogenesis and the correct dark matter relic density .",
    "the stop - neutralino co - annihilation mechanism can play an important part in this picture .",
    "the exploration of this scenario relies on precision measurements at accelerator experiments and will be within reach for the next generation of colliders , in particular the ilc .",
    "based on a detailed experimental simulation including detector effects , it was shown that light stop quarks can be discovered at the ilc for stop masses up to almost the beam energy and for stop - neutralino mass differences @xmath89 down to about 5 gev .",
    "in particular , the complete parameter region where stop - neutralino co - annihilation is effective can be covered . since stops with small @xmath90",
    "are difficult to explore at hadron colliders , the ilc thus provides a unique discovery capability for this kind of scenario .",
    "in addition , it was found that the stop mass and mixing angle can be accurately determined from measurements of the stop production cross - section for two different beam polarizations at the ilc .",
    "together with precision measurements in the chargino and neutralino sector , this would allow to compute the dark matter relic density from experimental results at the ilc in a bottom - up approach , _",
    "i.e. _ without assuming a specific mechanism or pattern for supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "including statistical and systematic errors in the experimental analysis , it was estimated that the precision for the relic density induced from ilc measurements is slightly worse , but comparable with the current direct determination from wmap and sdss .",
    "refinements in the determination of the stop mass can improve this result significantly .    in mssm scenarios that are consistent with electroweak baryogenesis ,",
    "the lower limit on the higgs boson mass from searches at lep and bounds from electric dipole moments , the sfermions of the first two generations need to be relatively heavy . as a consequence , for these scenarios",
    "the exploration of supersymmetric partners and their properties is difficult at the lhc .",
    "nevertheless , the lhc can establish lower limits on the masses of heavy superpartners , thus providing important information for the understanding and computation of the dark matter density in the universe .",
    "the present scenario with light scalar top quark and small stop - neutralino mass differences is also a motivation for refining the development of the vertex detector .",
    "the analysis is based on a fast and realistic simulation of a detector which includes a ccd vertex tracker .",
    "the importance of the vertex detector performance for c - quark tagging in scalar top quark decays has been discussed in the framework of the linear collider flavour identification ( lcfi ) collaboration which studies ccd detectors for quark flavour identification . regarding the vertex detector design , the study of c - quark tagging with small visible energy , as expected from the scalar top decays in the discussed scenario , is particularly challenging and could serve well as a benchmark reaction .",
    "this paper is the first step in a larger project aiming to explore in detail the collider signatures and measurements that can elucidate the origin of baryonic and dark matter in the universe within the framework of supersymmetry .",
    "future avenues include refinements in the experimental analysis , especially for small mass differences @xmath90 , and the investigation of the impact of the vertex detector layout on the charm tagging performance .    in this work ,",
    "the experimental analysis was designed with a selection procedure that is independent of the actual values of the unknown supersymmetry parameters .",
    "such a search strategy , which does not require any prior knowledge of the supersymmetry scenario , is important for a model - independent discovery potential .",
    "however , once evidence for a stop signal would be found and the stop and neutralino mass would be measured with some precision , the analysis can be refined using this knowledge , in order to achieve a better separation of signal and background and increase the precision of the stop parameter determination .    in the present analysis , the projected uncertainty in the computation of the dark matter abundance",
    "is dominated by the error in the stop mass . by including other methods for the stop mass measurement , the precision for the dark matter computation could possibly be improved substantially .",
    "a promising possibility is a method making use of cross - section measurements near the pair production threshold , which seems to be able to reduce the stop mass error by a factor of two .",
    "the present work has been performed using tree - level formulae and cross - sections for the ilc analysis and the computation of the dark matter annihilation rate .",
    "for the expected experimental precision , however , radiative corrections are important and introduce a dependence on other supersymmetry parameters , _ e.g. _ sfermion masses and mixing outside of the stop sector .",
    "this issue will be studied in future work .    in this publication",
    "a specific mssm scenario was studied in detail for the experimental determination of parameters and the dark matter analysis . in future work , this analysis shall be extended to other scenarios that are similarly cosmologically motivated , but have different collider signatures .",
    "the study presented in this report opens a window toward exploring some of the main unsolved questions in the evolution of the universe by establishing cross - relations between collider measurements and cosmological processes and by combining experimental analyses and theoretical computations . a sophisticated phenomenological program with precision measurements of new physics properties at the ilc sets the base for deepening our understanding of the cosmos .",
    "the numerical analysis in sections [ sec : param ] and [ sec : dm ] are based on a specific mssm parameter point characterized by the following values : @xmath91 the potentially large contribution of one - loop sfermion - neutralino and sfermion - chargino loops to the electric dipole moments of the electron and neutron requires the sleptons and squarks of the first two generations to be heavy .",
    "therefore all squark soft supersymmetry breaking parameters of the first two generations are taken to be 4 tev , and in addition , the left - chiral sleptons are also assumed to be heavy .",
    "the right - chiral sleptons contribute to the electron electric dipole moment on a sub - leading level and can be taken with a mass of a few hundred gev if the selectron @xmath56-parameter carries a cp - violating phase that cancels part of the effect of the phase of @xmath26 . here ,",
    "the right - chiral slepton soft supersymmetry breaking mass is assumed to be 200 gev , resulting in physical r - slepton masses within the kinematical reach of a 500 gev linear collider .",
    "the chosen parameters are compatible with a strongly first order electroweak phase transition for electroweak baryogenesis , @xmath11  @xcite , generate a sufficiently large baryon asymmetry , @xmath92 , and yield a value for the dark matter relic abundance within the wmap bounds , @xmath93 . in addition , the supersymmetry parameters , in particular the stop parameters , are chosen such that the mass of the lightest higgs boson is @xmath94 gev , sufficiently above the bound from direct searches at lep @xmath46 @xcite . at tree - level",

    "<S> the minimal supersymmetric standard model opens the possibility of electroweak baryogenesis provided that the light scalar top quark ( stop ) is lighter than the top quark . </S>",
