    "the recent discovery of topological insulators has generated great interest in the fields of condensed matter physics and materials science , largely driven by their exotic surface electronic properties .",
    "@xcite these materials are insulating in the bulk , but support topologically protected helical edge or surface state in two- or three - dimensional systems .  @xcite the surface states are predicted to have special properties that could be useful for practical applications in spintronics and quantum computation .",
    "@xcite to date , topological states have been observed in a number of materials ,  @xcite opening the door for detailed and systematic investigations of various topological phenomena in laboratories .",
    "while the essential features of topological insulators have been established , our understanding of the fundamental physics in relation to basic material properties is far from complete .",
    "this type of knowledge will be crucial in potential device applications .    in this work ,",
    "we theoretically demonstrate the possibility of tuning the topological order in cubic semiconductors by applying external strain , using insb as a prototype system .",
    "our choice of the material system is motivated by the fact that many technologically important semiconductors crystalize in one of the cubic crystal structures , including the group - iv elements in the diamond structure , and the iii - v and ii - vi compounds in the zinc - blende structure .",
    "ternary compound semiconductors with the tetrahedral coordination , such as half - heuslers  @xcite and chalcopyrites  @xcite , also belong to this category .",
    "we first establish , based on tight - binding analysis , that lattice _ expansion _ can induce a topological phase transition of small band - gap cubic semiconductors via a band inversion , and further breaking of the cubic symmetry leads to a topological insulating phase . using density functional theory calculations ,",
    "we then demonstrate that insb enters into a topologically nontrivial state at a reasonable biaxial lattice expansion around @xmath0 .",
    "the relationship between mechanical strain and topological order has been discussed in layered bismuth compounds  @xcite as well as half - heuslers  @xcite .",
    "our analysis provide a physical picture of these findings .",
    "the band topology of materials with time - reversal symmetry is characterized by the so - called @xmath1 topological index . in general",
    ", the calculation of the @xmath1 index requires the knowledge of the occupied bloch wave functions in the entire brillouin zone because it is a global property of the energy bands .",
    "however , in most practical situations the @xmath1 index can be determined by counting the number of band inversions at the time - reversal invariant @xmath2-points . in passing from a topologically trivial to nontrivial state , a band inversion ,",
    "i.e. , switching of occupied and unoccupied bands with opposite parity around the fermi level , must happen .",
    "if an odd number of band inversions occur within the brillouin zone , then the material could be a topological insulator .",
    "( color online ) the band order of cubic diamond / zinc - blende semiconductors at the @xmath3 point with @xmath4 .",
    "( a ) the normal band order .",
    "( b)-(c ) the inverted band order can be obtained from the normal band order by either increasing the spin - orbit coupling @xmath5 ( b ) or by decreasing the coupling potentials @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( c ) .",
    "the band inversion strength is defined as @xmath8 , which has positive value in normal band order and negative value in inverted band order . ]",
    "we now specialize to zinc - blende semiconductors . in a typical band structure ,",
    "the low - energy electronic properties is dominated by bands around the @xmath3 point .",
    "away from the @xmath3 point the valence and conduction bands are well separated .",
    "therefore we only need consider the band order at @xmath3 .",
    "the relevant states are the @xmath9 anti - bonding state of the @xmath10-orbitals , and the @xmath11 and @xmath12 bonding states of the @xmath13-orbitals . using the tight - binding model ,  @xcite the band energies of these states",
    "are obtained @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the @xmath10- and @xmath13-orbital energies of the cation and anion , respectively , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the coupling potentials of the @xmath10-@xmath10 and @xmath13-@xmath13 bonds , and @xmath5 is the spin - orbit coupling strength . note that @xmath9 and @xmath17 states have opposite parity .    usually , the @xmath9 state is located above the @xmath17 states , forming the conduction band minimum .",
    "this is the so - called normal band order [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : order](a ) ] . there are two ways to change the band order .",
    "( i ) if the spin - orbit coupling strength is increased , depending on the sign of @xmath5 , either the @xmath12 ( @xmath4 ) or the @xmath11 ( @xmath18 ) state could rise above the @xmath9 state , realizing the necessary band inversion [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : order](b ) ] .",
    "( ii ) in addition to varying @xmath5 , which is an intrinsic property of the material , the band order can be also changed by varying the coupling potentials @xmath6 and @xmath7 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : order](c ) ] . increasing the lattice constant leads to a decrease of the coupling potentials , which lowers",
    "the @xmath9 anti - bonding state and raises the @xmath17 bonding states . at sufficiently large lattice constant , the band inversion can be realized .",
    "thus in the design of topological insulators , both factors should be taken into account .",
    "the relation between the band gap and lattice constant has been discussed previously in the context of band gap pressure coefficient .",
    "@xcite in a more realistic situation , there are other factors that could affect the band positions , such as the @xmath13-@xmath19 coupling in the compounds with active @xmath19-orbitals in the valence bands , as well as the kinetic energy effect under pressure . a detailed analysis can be found in refs . ; the general trend we discussed above still holds .    finally , if @xmath20 in the inverted band structure ( @xmath4 ) , the twofold degenerate @xmath21 state is fully occupied while the fourfold degenerate @xmath22 state is half filled , resulting in a zero band - gap semiconductor [ for example , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hydrostatic](c ) and [ fig : hydrostatic](d ) ] . to realize a truly insulating ground state , a possible way is to apply a biaxial strain so as to break the cubic symmetry and thereby open a band gap at @xmath3 point [ see fig .",

    "having established the general tuning principle , next we verify whether the anticipated topological phase transition can happen in real materials at a reasonable lattice expansion .",
    "we choose insb as a prototype system because it has a relatively small band gap of 0.235 ev,@xcite indicating that insb is on the verge of becoming a topological insulator .",
    "the band structure calculations in this work were performed using full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave method@xcite implemented in package wien2k.@xcite a converged ground state was obtained using @xmath31 @xmath2-points in the first brillouin zone with @xmath32 , where @xmath33 represents the smallest muffin - tin radius and @xmath34 is the maximum size of reciprocal - lattice vectors .",
    "the muffin - tin radius was set to @xmath35 bohr for both in and sb atoms .",
    "wave functions and potentials inside the atomic sphere are expanded in spherical harmonics up to @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "spin - orbit coupling is included by a second - variational procedure ,  @xcite where states up to 9 ry above fermi level are included in the basis expansion .",
    "the modified becke - johnson exchange potential together with local - density approximation for the correlation potential ( mbjlda )  @xcite was used to obtain the band structures .",
    "the mbjda potential can effectively mimic the behavior of orbital - dependent potential around the band gap , and it is expected to obtain accurate positions of states near the band edge  @xcite .",
    "in fact , both standard local - density approximation ( lda)@xcite and generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite calculations predict that insb is a zero - band gap semiconductor with an inverted band order , while the mbjlda calculation produce a band gap about 0.253 ev , which is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 0.235 ev .  @xcite the mbjlad method has been applied for small band - gap half - heuslers in the context of topological insulators  @xcite and yields favorable comparison with more sophisticated gw method .",
    "@xcite    we consider two types of lattice expansion .",
    "the first is the hydrostatic lattice expansion , equally increasing the lattice constants along all the three axes .",
    "this situation is more of academic interest rather than for practical applications . in the second case",
    ", we consider the biaxial lattice expansion , where the crystal structure is expanded in the @xmath38-plane and relaxed in the @xmath39-axis .",
    "this can be achieved by growing the sample on a substrate with a larger lattice constant .",
    "although the mbjlda potential gives very accurate band gap and band order , it has no corresponding definition about its energy functional .",
    "@xcite hence , both the lda and gga for the exchange - correlation potential were used to optimize the lattice constants .",
    "-plane and ( b ) along @xmath39-axis .",
    "the black solid circles are the results without lattice optimization , orange down - diamonds and purple up - diamonds are optimized by lda and gga potential receptively .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) are normal band order and inverted band order , which correspond to the states marked by dotted circles in ( a ) .",
    "the size of dots is proportional to the probability of @xmath10-orbit projection . ]",
    "the crystal structure of insb is zinc - blende with space group @xmath40 ( no .",
    "the unit cell of insb contains two inequivalent atoms , in and sb , with the fractional coordinates ( 0,0,0 ) and ( 0.25,0.25,0.25 ) , respectively . the initial equilibrium lattice constant of 6.479 @xmath41",
    "is taken from previous experimental measurements.@xcite    figure  [ fig : hydrostatic ] shows the band structures of insb at its equilibrium lattice constant and under hydrostatic lattice expansion ranging from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "the relative energy changes of the states @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are listed in table  [ tab : energy1 ] .",
    "we find that , as anticipated , the band inversion takes place upon lattice expansion , somewhere between 1% and 2% .",
    "in addition , we find that the spin - orbit coupling strength , characterized by @xmath44 , stays almost a constant with a slight decrease as the lattice constant increases .",
    "hence the evolution of the band order during lattice expansion is dominated by the change of the coupling potentials @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "although a hydrostatic expansion already converts the normal band order into the inverted band order , a nonhydrostatic strain is still needed to creat a band gap at @xmath3 point by breaking the cubic symmetry . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : uniaxial ] , we investigate the evolution of band order with the nonhydrostatic expansion both in @xmath38-plane and along the @xmath39-axis .",
    "note that in the tetragonal symmetry the band inversion strength @xmath45 is redefined as the energy difference between the @xmath10-like states and the top of valence bands .",
    "first , we consider the lattice expansion in the @xmath38-plane with fixed lattice constant along the @xmath39-axis ( without lattice optimization ) . the @xmath45 change from positive values to negative values as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : uniaxial](a ) ( black solid circles ) .",
    "the band structures of two typical states are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : uniaxial](c ) and [ fig : uniaxial](d ) .",
    "one is normal band order with @xmath42 expansion [ fig .",
    "[ fig : uniaxial](c ) ] and another is inverted band order with @xmath43 expansion [ fig .  [",
    "fig : uniaxial](d ) ] .",
    "then , we consider the lattice optimization along the @xmath39-axis by using both lda and gga potential .",
    "it is well known that lda usually underestimates the lattice constant and gga overestimates it , hence these results give us a lower and upper bound . the true transition point for",
    "the expansion in @xmath38-plane is in the range of @xmath46 . finally ,",
    "if we expand the lattice along @xmath39-axis , there exist similar topological order transition .",
    "the only quantitative difference is that a larger lattice expansion is needed , as shown in [ fig : uniaxial](b ) .",
    "finally , we mention the possibility that the tensile biaxial expansion may also be realized by growing the cubic semiconductor on the top of a piezoelectric substrate whose lattice can be changed by applying an electric field . in this way",
    ", the topological order of the semiconductor can be tuned with electric field .",
    "in summary , we have explored the strain tuning of topological band order in cubic semiconductors by the combination of simple tight - binding analysis and density functional theory calculation .",
    "we have predicted that insb can realize the topological insulating state under the biaxial lattice expansion of @xmath47 .",
