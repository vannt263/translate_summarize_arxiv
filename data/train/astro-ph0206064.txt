    "hot cores in molecular clouds have a characteristic diameter of @xmath2 0.1 pc , density @xmath3 and temperature @xmath2 100 k. those hot cores that are luminous in the far ir ( l@xmath4 10@xmath5 l@xmath6 ) but have no free - free radio emission are thought to be precursors to ultra - compact ( uc ) hii regions ( kurtz et al , 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "they are found in regions of massive star formation , often offset from uc hii regions ( hunter et al .",
    "hot cores are principally studied through their molecular line emission and mm - submm continuum emission .",
    "hofner et al . (",
    "1996 ) observed the uc hii region complex g9.62 + 0.19 and found that ch@xmath0cn emission is centered on the youngest , densest component in this complex .",
    "this component also drives an energetic molecular outflow ( hofner et al .",
    "1996 ) and has weak ( @xmath7 1 mjy ) radio continuum emission at cm wavelengths ( testi et al .",
    "2000 ) . based on observations of g9.62 + 0.29 , hofner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) postulated that ch@xmath0cn emission might be a tracer of uc hii precursors .",
    "wilner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) used ch@xmath0cn ( j=12 - 11 ) observations of w49n to estimate the timescale for hot core evolution ; they concluded that hot cores , which preceed the uc hii stage , have lifetimes less than or equal to uc hii regions .",
    "zhang et al . ( 1998 ) observed many molecular lines , including ch@xmath0cn ( j=8 - 7 ) , toward w51 and concluded from line asymmetries that ch@xmath0cn was tracing infalling material .",
    "these studies found that ch@xmath0cn tends to be : 1 ) tightly confined ( @xmath2 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath8 au ) , 2 ) associated with regions of massive star formation and 3 ) optically thick in mm - wave transitions .",
    "watt & mundy ( 1999 ) observed ch@xmath0cn ( j=6 - 5 ) toward 4 massive star formation regions ( 2 detections , 2 nondetections ) .",
    "based on emission morphology , excitation analysis and chemical models by millar et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , watt & mundy ( 1999 ) concluded that the hot core near g34.26 + 0.15 traced by ch@xmath0cn emission was probably externally heated .",
    "in contrast to typical results from the observations cited above , they found no significant dust emission at 3 mm .",
    "based on single - dish detection and interferometer non - detection , they also concluded that the ch@xmath0cn emission toward g11.94 - 0.62 has an extent of @xmath2 50,000 au .    a ch@xmath0cn ( j=12 - 11 )",
    "survey was undertaken using the 10 m heinrich hertz submillimeter telescope ( smt ) toward 48 known massive star formation regions to determine the fraction with detectable ch@xmath0cn emission ( pankonin et al .",
    "forty - six percent of the regions surveyed were detected in ch@xmath0cn emission . because the angular resolution was @xmath230  , they were unable to determine if ch@xmath0cn originates from uc hii regions or from neighboring sites of even younger precursors of uc hii regions .",
    "pankonin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found beam - averaged rotation temperatures and column densities to be consistent with internal heating , presumably from embedded protostars or the ionizing stars of the uc hiis .",
    "they argued that beam dilution allowed only lower limits for ch@xmath0cn column densities .",
    "an investigation in the lines of ch@xmath0cn ( j=6 - 5 ) using interferometric resolution toward w75n is presented here to better determine the properties of this source and to establish how important resolution effects may be in the analysis of ch@xmath0cn line emission .",
    "w75n was selected because it is a relatively nearby region of massive star formation region with strong ch@xmath0cn emission and there are few previous observations of the hot core in this object .",
    "observations of w75n were obtained with the bima millimeter interferometer ( welch et al .",
    "1996 ) on october 8 , 11 and 12 , 1999 and april 30 , 2000 in the c configuration and on october 14 , 1999 in the b configuration .",

    "2025 + 337 was found to have a flux density of 2.29 jy , which is within the range of previous measurements ( welch et al .",
    "all data editing and reduction were performed using the miriad package ( sault , teuben , & wright 1995 ) .",

    "mm1 is one of the most compact hot cores yet observed ( @xmath10 = 5.0  x 1.5  = 10,000 au x 3,000 au ) .",
    "the distribution of line emission is slightly elliptical , with a deconvolved major - to - minor axis ratio of 3.4 and position angle of 24@xmath11 west of north , determined by a least - squares 2d gaussian fit to the line emission .",
    "the individual k - components were imaged separately and found to be indistinguishable from the integrated line emission .",
    "the mm1 continuum emission is also elongated with a position angle , 24@xmath12 west of north but deconvolved axis ratio of 1.6 .",
    "mm1 has a peak 3 mm continuum flux density of 80 @xmath13 16 mjy / beam and integrated continuum flux density of 390 @xmath13 80 mjy ( integrated over 200 square arcsecs ) .",

    "1997 at 1.3 cm ) .",
    "those observations had beam sizes @xmath2 0.1  , which permitted them to resolve the cm - sources ( see figure  [ continuum ] , each vla source is represented by a white x ) .",
    "the sources lie roughly along the mm continuum major axis of mm1 .",
    "the mm continuum and ch@xmath0cn major axes are both perpendicular to the mm1 outflow axis ( discussed below ) .",
    "this alignment is suggestive of an oblate cloud core , although the mm and ch@xmath0cn morphology could also result from the alignment of the three compact vla continuum sources . mm1 and",
    "mm2 were not detected by the msx satellite ( mill et al .",
    "1994 ) between 8@xmath14 m and 21@xmath14 m .",
    "modeling the emission as thermal dust emission at t=35 k ( see section 3.3.2 ) , we estimate that expected flux densities ( s@xmath15 1 mjy ) are below the msx detection limits ( s@xmath16 100 mjy ) .",
    "a second mm - continuum source , mm2 , was found @xmath17 5  to the southwest of mm1 .",
    "mm2 has a peak 3 mm continuum flux density of 45 @xmath13 9 mjy / beam and integrated continuum flux density of 200 @xmath13 40 mjy .",
    "mm2 was not detected at cm wavelengths , indicating that its mm emission is probably due to dust .",
    "previous submm observations do not have the spatial resolution to distinguish between mm1 and mm2 ( hunter et al .",
    "mm2 was also not detected via k - band photometry by moore et al .",
    "( 1988 , 1991 ) or msx ( 8@xmath14 m to 21 @xmath14 m ) .",
    "absence of emission at k - band is probably due to intrinsically weak emission , although high optical depth may also be important at @xmath18 m . there are four possible explanations for these observations which we can not distinguish between : 1 ) mm2 is heated by a proto o - star which has not formed a detectable hii region because of infall , 2 ) mm2 is heated by a non - ionizing star , 3 ) mm2 is heated by internal shocks , probably associated with the outflow from mm1 , or 4 ) mm2 is heated externally , probably by the three cm - components of mm1 .      a bipolar outflow has been detected toward mm1 in co ( j=3 - 2 ) ( davis et al .",
    "1998a ; hunter et al .",
    "1994 ) , co ( j=2 - 1 ) ( davis et al .",
    "1998b ) and in cm - radio continuum ( torrelles et al .",
    "1997 ) ; all of whom find that the outflow position angle is 66@xmath12 east of north ( indicated by a black line in figures  [ continuum ] and  [ emline ] ) .",
    "the outflow source has not been clearly determined .",
    "the outflow axis is perpendicular to the mm - continuum and ch@xmath0cn major axis .",
    "the cm continuum is likely produced by free - free emission , which , assuming the source is optically thin , would not be detectable at 3 mm .",
    "oh masers have also been measured along the outflow axis , although no significant velocity gradient was measured ( hunter et al .",
    "1994 and torrelles et al . 1997 ) .",
    "shepherd ( 2001 ) observed w75n at 3 mm and 1 mm and found a third mm source ( mm3 ) @xmath210  to the northeast of mm1 , hinted at by the lowest contour in figure  [ continuum ] .",
    "mm3 , like mm2 , lies along the outflow axis but on the opposite side of mm1 relative to mm2 .",
    "using flux density measurments at 1  mm ( 230 ghz ) and 3  mm ( 90 ghz ) of shepherd ( 2001 ) , the spectral indices of mm2 and mm3 are 3.1 and 1.8 , respectively . comparing shepherd s measurements with those in this study , we estimate the error in the spectral index of mm2 to be large , @xmath21 .",
    "the alignment of mm2 and mm3 suggests that they are associated with the outflow from mm1 . in this scenario and based on its spectral index , emission from mm2 and mm3 could originate either from shock heated dust or shock - ionized optically thick gas in the outflow .",
    "ch@xmath0cn is a symmetric top molecule whose k - components are closely spaced in frequency but have a wide range of excitation energies above ground .",
    "j=6 - 5 , k=0 has an excitation energy of 13 k above ground , whereas the k=3 transition , which is only 19 mhz lower in frequency , is 76 k above ground .",
    "assuming the line emission from mm1 is optically thin , an excitation analysis , based on the radiation transfer equation , allows a determination of the rotation temperature ( t@xmath20 ) and column density ( n@xmath21 ) .    the pattern of k - components were simultaneously fit with gaussian profiles . that is , we fixed the line separations and shifted the overall pattern to obtain a least squares fit .",
    "we also forced each line to have the same fwhm , true if all emission lines originate in the same volume .",
    "thus , we allowed only 6 free parameters at each position : one common width ( fwhm ) , one pattern velocity and 4 intensities ( t@xmath22 ) .",
    "the gaussians were fit using a levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization technique ( argonne national labs , minipak project 1980 ) .",
    "we discarded fits to spectra at any position for which t@xmath23 for any single emission line .",
    "some of the assumptions on which the excitation analysis rests are not strictly true .",
    "specifically , the ratios of k - component intensities show that @xmath24 1 in mm1 for many lines .",
    "figure  [ tau ] shows the k=3 optical depth as calculated from its ratio with the k=2 line .",
    "the k=3 optical depth was found to range from 0.7 to @xmath2 8.5 .",
    "if the emission lines originate from different volumes of gas , however , this optical depth measurement would not be accurate .",
    "the optical depth of the k=0 and k=1 lines were not calculated because of blending .",
    "the optical depth of the k=4 line was not calculated because the line was not strong enough for a spatially resolved analysis .",
    "goldsmith & landger ( 1999 ) studied the effects of optical depth on the boltzmann analysis and concluded that in such an analysis optically thick emission lines can produce a large scatter . in order to avoid calculating erroneous excitation temperatures and column densities ,",
    "goldsmith & landger ( 1999 ) recommend combining observations of lines with a wide range of rotational states .",
    "pankonin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) compared results between their boltzmann analysis and three different statistical equilibrium analyses and found that the average difference between the two methods in t@xmath20 was @xmath230% .",
    "pankonin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also derived lower limits for n@xmath21 which were a factor of @xmath23 lower than the statistical equilibrium analyses . because the optical depth of these lines is large , we limit our analysis to the determination of line optical depths from line data and mass from continuum data .",
    "pankonin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found that in a sample of 20 sources with 5 detected ch@xmath0cn ( j=12 - 11 ) k - components , 8 had k=2 component optical depths @xmath25 8 .",
    "since w75n was among the 12 sources they reported without an optical depth measurement , our analysis here implies that ch@xmath0cn line emission from hot cores frequently may be optically thick . in such cases ,",
    "a source model including kinematics coupled with a radiative transfer / statistical equilibrium analysis is essential to correctly determine physical properties such as t@xmath20 and n@xmath21 .",
    "observations with significantly higher resolution observations , high signal - to - noise and a wide range of excitation energy will be required to provide enough constraints to justify such a model .",
    "the ch@xmath0cn emission observations toward w75n show some similarity to observations toward iras 20126 + 4104 ( cesaroni et al .",
    "that study concluded that ch@xmath0cn was tracing an infalling accretion disk .",
    "the resemblance , however , is only strong enough to encourage further observations as described above .",
    "we can also approximate the mass in mm1 and mm2 using the measured mm - continuum .",
    "we estimate the free - free emission contribution to the 3 mm emission by extrapolating from observations at 1.3 cm ( torrelles et al .",
    "1997 ) and 3.6 cm ( hunter et al .",
    "the three cm - components of mm1 all have rising spectra from 3.6 cm to 1.3 cm , indicating the sources are partly optically thick . using the spectral index between 3.6 cm and 1.3 cm to esimate the flux density at 3 mm due to free - free emission would predict @xmath2 100 mjy .",
    "if the sources are optically thin shortward of 1.3 cm , however , we estimate the free - free component would be @xmath220 mjy at @xmath26 = 3 mm . since we wish to obtain an upper mass limit ( see below ) and would prefer to overestimate the dust emission , we assume the free - free component of the 3 mm emission of mm1 is @xmath220 mjy . assuming thermal dust emission accounts for the remaining 3 mm emission ( 370 mjy ) and following the method of hildebrand ( 1983 ) , mm - continuum emission is related to the total mass ( gas + dust ) according to : @xmath27 where d is the distance to the source , f@xmath28 is the continuum flux density , b@xmath28 is the planck function at frequency @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the opacity of dust at @xmath29 .",
    "m@xmath31 is given as a lower limit because the measured flux density may not represent the entire range of dust temperatures present .",
    "we assume a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 and thus @xmath32 @xmath33 g@xmath34 ( carpenter 2000 ) .",
    "we assume a frequency index , @xmath35 = 1.5 ( shepherd 2000 , pollack et al .",
    "1994 ) for the dust opacity .",
    "this result is sensitive to the assumed value of t@xmath36 .",
    "if we use a lower limit for t@xmath36 = 10 k , however , the relationship above gives an upper mass limit of 440 m@xmath37 for mm1 ( see table  [ results ] ) .",
    "if more than @xmath2500 m@xmath37 were present at any reasonable temperature , we would measure a greater flux density at 3 mm .",
    "since typical values for the mass of clouds that give rise to o - stars are @xmath38 1,000 m@xmath37 ( see hunter et al . 2000 ) , we conclude that w75n is unlikely to be forming an o - star .",
    "this result is consistent with hunter et al .",
    "( 1994 ) who inferred the spectral types of the three cm sources comprising mm1 to be early b - stars . since hunter et al .",
    "( 1994 ) did not account for dust absorption or free - free self - absorption , however , the true spectral types may be earlier . the mass upper limit calculated for mm2 using the same method",
    "is reported in table  [ results ] .",
    "ch@xmath0cn ( j=6 - 5 ) was observed toward w75n using the bima interferometer with 2  resolution .",
    "five compact ( @xmath2 10,000 au ) k - components were detected ( k=0 - 4 ) toward the peak of mm1 .",
    "ch@xmath0cn emission is elongated with a deconvolved major - minor axis ratio of 3.4 .",
    "the major axis coincides with the alignment of three cm - continuum sources reported previously with 0.1  resolution vla observations .",
    "thus , the elongation is probably caused by multiple sources lying approximately along a straight line projected on the plane of the sky , although we can not rule out ch@xmath0cn tracing out an oblate cloud core .",
    "a bipolar outflow was previously detected toward mm1 in co(j=1 - 0 , j=3 - 2 ) and cm - continuum .",
    "mm2 and mm3 ( detected by shepherd 2001 ) lie on opposite sides of mm1 along the outflow axis , indicating that they may be heated by shocks as the outflow interacts with the local interstellar medium .",
    "analysis of k=2 and 3 emission lines indicates that ch@xmath0cn ( j=6 - 5 ) is optically thick ( @xmath39 8) .",
    "thus , a radiative transfer / statistical equilibrium model which encorporates source kinematics and temperature and density gradients will be required to estimate t@xmath20 and n@xmath40 .",
    "the results of this study support the previously observed pattern that ch@xmath0cn in massive star formation regions tends to be compact ( @xmath2 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath8 au ) and optically thick in mm - wave transitions .",
