    "psr  j0514@xmath04002a was discovered in a 327-mhz search for steep - spectrum pulsars in globular clusters ( gcs ) carried out with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) at khodad , near pune , india ( freire et al .",
    "2004 , henceforth paper i ) .",
    "the pulsar is located in the globular cluster ngc  1851 and we will hereafter designate it to be ngc  1851a .",
    "it has a spin frequency of 200 hz and is a member of a binary system , with a massive @xmath7 companion and a very eccentric orbit ( @xmath8 ) .    in the galaxy",
    ", all msps are either found isolated or in low - eccentricity binary systems with low - mass white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "there are pulsars with eccentric orbits and massive companions , but their spin periods are tens , not hundreds , of hz . for these systems ,",
    "there is not much time for accretion before the massive companion becomes a neutron star ( see lorimer , 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "ngc  1851a has hybrid characteristics .",
    "its fast rotation indicates that the pulsar itself probably formed in the same manner as a normal msp , ending up with a light wd companion in a nearly circular orbit .",
    "however , a subsequent stellar interaction could have disrupted the original binary system , replacing the lowest mass component ( the original wd ) with the present companion star in a highly eccentric orbit .",
    "such exchange interactions are only likely to happen in environments with very high stellar densities , like the central regions of globular clusters .",
    "the same process could also form even more exotic systems , such as msp / msp or msp / black hole binaries .",
    "an alternative scenario for the formation of such binaries is the nearly head - on collision of a neutron star ( possibly even an msp ) with a giant star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this can form an e  =  0.9 binary system consisting of the msp and the stripped core of the giant star .",
    "we discuss this possibility at length in section ",
    "[ sec : flux ] , since it might provide an explanation for the unusual flux density variations observed for this system .    in paper",
    "i , we had limited information to constrain the nature of the companion star , no mass estimates for either the pulsar or the companion , and no precise pulsar timing solution . in order to correct these deficiencies",
    ", we observed the pulsar on 43 occasions over the last two years with the green bank telescope , and we present the results below .",
    "when observing ngc  1851a , we used mostly the prime - focus receiver pf1 with the 350-mhz feed . on several occasions , however , we used the pf1 receiver with the 425- and 820-mhz feeds , and twice used s - band receiver .",
    "the back - end instrument was the pulsar spigot ( kaplan et al .",
    "for the observations at frequencies below 1ghz , where the pulsar is clearly detectable , we observed a total bandwidth of 50mhz , divided in 1024 channels , with a sampling time of 81.92@xmath9s .",
    "the s - band observations had a bandwidth of 600mhz , 768 channels , and 81.92@xmath9s sampling .",
    "the data were dedispersed and folded using the presto software package , resulting in 64-bin pulse profiles ( @xmath1077@xmath11s per bin ) approximately every 500s .    with the pulsar s dispersion measure ( dm ) of 52.14pc@xmath12 , the 350mhz observations had 492@xmath11s of dispersive smearing in each channel , giving an effective system time resolution of 499@xmath11s .",
    "at this frequency , dispersive smearing is the dominant contribution to the width of the gaussian - like pulse profile , which is @xmath10590@xmath11s at half - power . at 425 mhz",
    "the dispersive smearing is 275@xmath11s and the total time resolution is 287@xmath11s , compared to the observed pulse width of @xmath10370@xmath11s .",
    "therefore dispersive smearing is still the dominant contribution to the pulse width at 425mhz .",
    "these measurements suggest that the use of coherent dedispersion would significantly improve the timing precision of this pulsar .",
    "we cross - correlated the average pulse profiles with a gaussian template in the fourier domain @xcite to obtain topocentric times of arrival ( toas ) .",
    "these were then analyzed with tempo , using the de 405 solar system ephemeris @xcite to model the motion of the green bank telescope relative to the solar system barycenter .",
    "after an initial fit , we obtained a @xmath13 per degree of freedom of 1.5 .",
    "because there are no unmodeled trends in the residuals ( their distribution is gaussian ) , we believe that the routine used to derive the toas is slightly under - estimating the toa uncertainties . after increasing the toa uncertainties by 22% ( a value similar to what we have seen for isolated msps timed with the same software ) we obtained a @xmath13 per degree of freedom of 1.0 .",
    "the resulting timing parameters are presented in table [ tab : parameters ] , the uncertainties are the 1-@xmath14 tempo estimates .",
    "the significance of these timing parameters is discussed below .",
    "the orbital parameters were determined using the damour & deruelle orbital model @xcite .",
    "we measured the longitude of periastron ( @xmath15 ) and the time of periastron passage ( @xmath16 ) at a time ( august 2005 ) where we have a sequence of daily observations that cover one full orbit . that @xmath16 was chosen as the reference epoch .",
    "the relativistic parameter @xmath17 , if included in the model , is very strongly correlated with the projected semi - major axis @xmath18 and @xmath15 . when @xmath17 eventually becomes needed by the timing model ,",
    "the measured @xmath18 and @xmath15 will not change by more than 0.007s and 0.09@xmath19 , respectively , from their present values .",
    "in paper i , the position of the source identified as the pulsar in an interferometric map of the cluster is given as @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 given in table [ tab : parameters ] are 1-@xmath14 consistent with these values , but much more precise .",
    "the pulsar is about 4@xmath246 ( about 1.3 core radii ) east of the center of the cluster ( see table [ tab : gc ] ) .",
    "such close proximity to the center is typical for gc pulsars due to the effects of mass segregation .",
    "the uncertainty in the derived magnitude of the projected offset from the center of the cluster is dominated by uncertainties in the position of the cluster center and the cluster s core radius .",
    "the observed period derivative , @xmath25 , is the sum of several different terms @xcite :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the intrinsic period derivative of the pulsar , @xmath28 is the difference in galactic accelerations between the solar system barycenter and ngc  1851 projected along the line - of - sight , @xmath11 and @xmath29 are the proper motion and distance to the pulsar ( assumed to be the same as the cluster values in table [ tab : gc ] ) and @xmath30 is the acceleration of the binary caused by the cluster , also projected along the line - of - sight . for @xmath28 , we obtain @xmath31 @xcite . for @xmath32 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath33 , using the value for @xmath11 obtained by dinescu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . with these values and @xmath25",
    "we obtain :    @xmath34    pulsars with negative @xmath35 can put lower limits on the absolute value of @xmath30 , and for that reason have been used to study the gravitational potential of their parent gcs ( e.g. , possenti et al .",
    "2002 , freire et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this case , that ca nt be done , but we can say that it is very likely that the pulsar is located on the more distant half of the cluster . if it were on the near side , then @xmath30 in eqn .",
    "[ eq : acc2 ] would be positive , and @xmath36 ( 2@xmath37 upper limit ) .",
    "this would imply an anomalous characteristic age of more than 280 gyr . in the likely event that the pulsar has a more normal characteristic age",
    ", then @xmath30 has to be negative , placing the pulsar on the far side of the cluster .    in table",
    "[ tab : gc ] , @xmath38 is the spread of stellar line - of - sight velocities at the core . using this , the cluster core radius and an analytical gravitational model for the central regions of gcs @xcite , we can calculate the maximum negative acceleration that the cluster can induce on the pulsar at its sky position . from this",
    "we can derive an upper limit on the intrinsic period derivative and surface magnetic flux density , and a lower limit on the characteristic age ( see table [ tab : parameters ] ) , as assumed in the formation scenarios in paper i.",
    "in paper i , we reached the conclusion that , in the event of an extended companion , the circularization timescale for this system is larger than the age of the cluster .",
    "an extended companion could not therefore be disproved because of the system s eccentricity .    in table",
    "[ tab : geometry ] , we present results of calculations of the companion masses , absolute component separation at superior conjunction ( @xmath39 ) and its projection in the plane of the sky ( @xmath40 ) for a set of orbital inclinations .",
    "the companion masses are calculated for a pulsar mass of 1.2  m@xmath5 ; the mass of the lightest known ns , the companion of psr  j1756@xmath02251 ( faulkner et al .",
    "2005 , ferdman et al .",
    "2006 ) . for these companion masses",
    ", we list the radii of zero - age main - sequence stars , calculated using @xmath41 , which apply for stars of mass similar to that of the sun @xcite .",
    "the use of the smallest possible pulsar mass and corresponding zero age main sequence radii leads to the lowest possible companion masses and ( if extended ) sizes , the most conservative assumption in the discussion that follows .    for @xmath42",
    "( limits are approximate ) , the companion masses are above 1m@xmath5 . in a star cluster as old as ngc  1851 ( about 9gyr ,",
    "[ tab : gc ] ) , such stars have either finished their life cycles and left compact remnants behind , or are now in their giant phases .",
    "giant stars have radii that are tens to hundreds of times that of similarly massive stars on the main sequence , which are of the order of one solar radius .",
    "such giant stars would not even fit within the distance between the components of ngc  1851a at superior conjunction or periastron .",
    "in the first scan taken in 2006 july 7 , we can detect the pulsar clearly through periastron , implying that the possibility of such a giant companion is excluded .    for @xmath43 ,",
    "the radius of a main - sequence companion star is larger than @xmath44 , implying that an eclipse should occur .",
    "the longitude of periastron for this system is 82.27@xmath19 , and therefore superior conjunction occurs at a true anomaly of 7.73@xmath19 , 15min and 54.1s after periastron . for the second scan taken on 2006 july 7 , the two toas occur 11.3 and 22.5 min of barycentric time after the periastron and this observation , superior conjunction occurred 15min and 52.8s after periastron , a difference of 1.3s relative to the reference epoch . ] .",
    "the pulsar is detectable throughout the whole scan .",
    "this excludes the possibility of the companion being a main sequence star with a mass smaller than 0.87  m@xmath5 .    for @xmath45",
    ", we could in principle avoid eclipses and still postulate a main - sequence companion . for any higher pulsar mass , or extended stars larger than zero age main - sequence ,",
    "this inclination interval becomes smaller .",
    "however , even for the lowest inclination listed in table [ tab : geometry ] , the pulsar signal would be passing only 1.2  r@xmath5 above the surface of the companion , right through its corona .",
    "we also note that the pulsar wind should lead to a denser and more extended corona in this star , so we should be able to detect some increase in the electron column density at this orbital phase . dividing the second observation of 2006 july 7 in 4 sub - bands and calculating toas for the whole observation",
    ", we obtain a dm of 52.148(5)pc@xmath12 , not measurably different than the dm at other orbital phases and smaller than the increases in the plasma column density seen at superior conjunction for pulsars with extended companions ( see freire , 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , if the companion was extended , there would be tidal effects on the orbit of the pulsar ( e.g. , psr  j0045@xmath07319 , lai 1996 and psr  b1259@xmath063 , wang et al .",
    "these include changes in the inclination ( and therefore , changes in the projected size @xmath46 ) of the orbit , large variations in the orbital period ( @xmath47 ) , and unmodeled and systematic trends in the residuals .",
    "as described above , the values for @xmath48 and @xmath49 are not significant ( see table [ tab : parameters ] ) , and the object times as well as an isolated msp , with no unmodeled trends in the residuals despite the fact that our timing precision is much higher than for either psr  j0045@xmath07319 or psr  b1259@xmath063 . in order to avoid eclipses and any measurable tidal effects",
    ", the companion has to be a compact object .",
    "the implications of this are discussed below .      for a system consisting of two compact objects ,",
    "the observed @xmath50 is due solely to the effects of general relativity .",
    "this allows an estimate of the total mass of the system : @xmath51 .",
    "given the mass function , the pulsar mass can not be larger than 1.50m@xmath5 and the companion mass must be larger than 0.96m@xmath5 . for a median inclination of 60@xmath19 ,",
    "the mass of the pulsar is 1.350m@xmath5 , a value that is fairly typical of the neutron stars with well - determined masses . in this case",
    ", the companion mass would be about 1.105m@xmath5 .    for @xmath52",
    ", both components would have masses within the present range of well - measured neutron stars ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_mass ] ) ; however , given a flat probability distribution in @xmath53 , it is about 15 times more likely that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 . in the higher inclination range , there is the possibility that the companion is the lightest ns ever discovered .",
    "however , this is probably more than compensated for in the lower inclination range by the possibility that the companion is a wd or a stripped core of a giant star with @xmath56 .",
    "we therefore believe that the probabilities are not far from 15 to 1 against the companion being a neutron star . given the slight possibility , though , that the companion star could be a msp , we searched several of the 350 , 820 , and 1950mhz observations for additional pulsations , but found none .",
    "in table [ tab : parameters ] we list the average flux densities at 350 , 425 , 820 and 1950mhz , together with the number of observations averaged , we derive a spectral index of @xmath02.65 . at 350mhz , the flux density changes very significantly , from about 0.2 to 1.4mjy .",
    "even our brightest detection is significantly fainter than the average flux density reported in paper i ( 3.4@xmath570.4mjy ) .",
    "this could explain the discrepancy in reported spectral indices ; in paper i we use the non - detection at 610mhz to derive @xmath58 .",
    "however , the gmrt flux density at 325mhz comes from imaging , so it is possible that there is extra unpulsed radio emission in the vicinity of the pulsar .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility of some lapse in our understanding of the sensitivity of these systems .",
    "the timescale for the variations near periastron ( @xmath59 ) is of the order of 1000s ; near apastron the flux density is seen to change very slowly and monotonically over several hours , only becoming significant from one day to the next ( i.e.  @xmath60 ) .",
    "the flux density variations are almost certainly not caused by diffractive scintillation .",
    "the scintillation bandwidth at 350mhz is ( very roughly ) 10@xmath020khz ( cordes and lazio 2002 ) , so our observations average over many hundreds of scintles in the 50mhz bandwidth . furthermore , refractive scintillation will change the flux by no more than @xmath1050% , on timescales of @xmath1010@xmath61 seconds ( cordes and lazio , 2002 ) . therefore ,",
    "if the ism between us and the cluster has everywhere a kolmogorov spatial spectrum and is described , to within a few orders of magnitude , by the cordes and lazio model , then no large - amplitude variations in the flux density should be observed .",
    "scintillation by a region or regions of particularly high ionized gas density could provide an explanation , we could alternatively be dealing with small eclipses caused by gas in the vicinity of the binary .",
    "flux density variations of similar magnitude and duration have been observed for several eclipsing binary pulsars away from superior conjunction .",
    "the best documented examples are psr  j1740@xmath05340 , a msp - main sequence binary located in the gc ngc  6397 ( ferraro et al .",
    "2001 ) , and psr  j1748@xmath02446a , an eclipsing binary msp located in the gc terzan  5 @xcite also known as terzan  5  a. as in virtually all eclipsing binaries , the companions of these two pulsars are losing gas as a result of their interaction with the pulsar wind .",
    "part of the observed flux density variations away from superior conjunction are due to secondary eclipses thought to be caused by gas clumps that remain in the vicinity of these binary systems ; even though the precise mechanism of the modulation is not known .",
    "many , but not all , of these secondary eclipses are `` total '' ( i.e.  the pulsars become completely undetectable ) .",
    "the companion of ngc  1851a is much more massive than the companions of either psr  j1740@xmath05340 or terzan  5  a. no outgassing has ever been clearly detected by pulsar timing in systems where the companion is a massive white dwarf , and it has not been detected in ngc  1851a either (  [ sec : companion ] )",
    ". however , there could still be gas clumps in the vicinity of the system if the companion of ngc  1851a is outgassing at a lower level than what we can detect .",
    "this is a possibility if it is a stripped core of a giant star .    unlike psr  j1740@xmath05340 or terzan  5  a , in ngc  1851a we detect no ``",
    "total '' eclipses caused by gas clumps at superior conjunction or away from it .",
    "furthermore , a common feature of such eclipses is that they invariably affect the lower frequencies more strongly ( e.g.  longer duration eclipses ) , although in varying degrees for different binary systems .",
    "that is not observed in ngc  1851a , where the attenuation may be frequency dependent , although in a variable and inconsistent manner .",
    "however , it is important to note that the behavior of the other pulsars mentioned above varies strongly from orbit to orbit . in our case , we only have good observations through a single periastron and superior conjunction . with the current data we can not conclusively demonstrate that the variations are caused by orbiting gas .",
    "however , we do consider it a possible explanation for the observed flux density variations .",
    "it is possible that , despite the predictions of cordes and lazio , the changes in flux density are indeed due to scintillation .",
    "this is more likely if , somewhere between us and the pulsar , there are unusual regions of the ism acting as strong lenses .",
    "we can use the changes in @xmath62 to constrain their location . assuming a maximum inclination of 90@xmath19 , the pulsar is traveling at @xmath63l73kms@xmath64 relative to the center of mass at periastron , and at @xmath6510kms@xmath64 relative to the center of mass at apastron .",
    "furthermore , the distance and proper motion listed for this cluster in table [ tab : gc ] imply a perpendicular cluster velocity of @xmath10160  km  s@xmath64 .    if the lenses are near us , at apastron the velocity of the pulsar @xmath66 relative to those lenses can not be much different from the perpendicular velocity of the cluster times @xmath67 ( the distance from the solar system to the lens divided by the distance from the solar system to ngc  1851 ) .",
    "at periastron , we obtain @xmath68  km  s@xmath64 , depending on how the pulsar s orbital velocity at periastron adds to its proper motion .",
    "this would imply @xmath69 , which is inconsistent with observation .",
    "if @xmath67 is very small , then the earth s orbital velocity becomes dominant in determining @xmath62 and we can then produce a larger range of @xmath70 , however , no seasonal variations in @xmath71 are observable . if , on the other hand , the medium responsible for the variations has a small velocity relative to the center of mass of the binary , we obtain @xmath72 , which is consistent with observation .",
    "this suggests that a hypothetical lensing medium would probably be located in the cluster , which is also the case if we were instead observing gas clumps orbiting the binary itself . given the proximity to the pulsar , we can then readily estimate the associated spatial scale of the medium , independently of its nature , from @xmath73 and @xmath59 : about 10@xmath74 km .",
    "in this work we have determined the phase - coherent timing solution of ngc  1851a .",
    "this allowed us to locate the pulsar in the globular cluster and determine precise rotational and orbital parameters .",
    "the geometry of the system , the lack of any observable tidal effects in the timing and the lack of eclipses or a measurable increase of the dm at superior conjunction allow us to exclude the possibility of an extended companion .",
    "this in turn allows us to calculate the total mass of the system from the observed rate of the advance of periastron : 2.453(14)m@xmath5 .",
    "the pulsar mass has to be smaller than 1.5  m@xmath5 and the companion mass has to be larger than 0.96  m@xmath5 .",
    "the companion is either a massive wd or the stripped core of a giant star , and less likely a neutron star .",
    "the flux density variations remain puzzling .",
    "they could be due to gas clumps in the vicinity of the binary created by outgassing from the companion , a possibility considering that it could be the stripped core of a giant star .",
    "alternatively , they could be due to refractive scintillation , in which case the lensing structures are also likely to be located in ngc  1851 .",
    "this would imply the presence of intra - cluster gas , the second instance after 47  tucanae @xcite where such gas was confirmed in a globular cluster .",
    "if we observe the pulsar often close to periastron , it might be possible to measure the velocity of the binary relative to the medium that causes the flux density variations and decide which of the scenarios discussed is the correct one .",
    "furthermore , a detailed study of the orbital variability of @xmath62 might allow a determination of the orbital inclination of the system , and lead to a determination of the individual masses .",
    "so far , only one msp , psr  j1909@xmath03744 has a well - determined mass , 1.44m@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "measuring more msp masses precisely is important in order to estimate how much mass a neutron star needs to accrete in order to become a msp .    such a detailed mass measurement will be confirmed ( or refuted ) by the measurement of another relativistic timing effect , the einstein delay ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "our simulations suggest that , with the present observing strategy and timing precision , we will be able to measure @xmath17 to better than 1 ms within 6 to 8 years . for an edge - on orbit ,",
    "@xmath17 is predicted to be 16.13ms , and for @xmath75 , @xmath76ms .",
    "the shapiro delay can not be measured with the present timing precision , no tests of general relativity are possible with the present telescope sensitivities .    the national radio astronomy observatory is a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , incorporated .",
    "we thank jason hessels and fernando camilo for help with observations , david nice for assistance with toa simulation software and christopher salter for a first skeptic review of the paper .",
