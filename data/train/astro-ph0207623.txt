    "after @xmath3and @xmath4 , the most abundant nucleus in a @xmath5 white dwarf ( wd ) interior is @xmath0 .",
    "the reason for this starts with the physics of the cno cycle in the hydrogen burning phase of a star s life .",
    "the slowest step in the cno cycle is the proton capture onto @xmath6and almost all of the cno catalyst nuclei end up as @xmath6at the completion of @xmath7burning .",
    "the @xmath6@xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11@xmath12@xmath0reaction sequence during the subsequent helium burning then processes all the @xmath6into @xmath0 .",
    "this results in a @xmath0mass fraction of @xmath13 for recently formed wds of @xmath5 ( see , for example , @xcite ) made from stars of initial mass @xmath14 .",
    "the possibility that @xmath0could play a role in the energetics of a cooling wd was first noted by @xcite .",
    "they discussed the possibility of gravitational energy release if @xmath0phase separates at core crystallization .",
    "this was followed by more detailed studies @xcite which differed in their conclusions about the final state once crystallization was complete ; ranging from all the @xmath0 in the stellar center to most of it having an unchanged profile .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter bh01 ) examined another aspect of @xmath0which had been previously overlooked ( except for a brief mention in bravo et al .",
    "1992 ) , namely its ability to sink through the liquid wd interior .",
    "as discussed in bh01 , there is an upward pointing electric field of magnitude @xmath15 in the degenerate wd interior , where @xmath1 is the local gravitational acceleration and @xmath16 is the proton mass . the net force on @xmath0is therefore @xmath17 , biasing the diffusion of @xmath0inward .",
    "it is the excess neutrons of the @xmath0nucleus ( relative to the predominant @xmath18 nuclei , @xmath19 being the atomic mass number and @xmath20 the charge ) that make it special in this regard .",
    "bh01 found that the gravitational energy released by sedimenting @xmath0is comparable to the thermal content of the wd at an age of a few gyrs .",
    "this raised the question of whether @xmath0could settle fast enough to significantly affect the wd s cooling significantly .",
    "the rate at which @xmath0sinks in the liquid c / o wd depends on the @xmath0diffusion coefficient , @xmath21 .",
    "the conditions there are very non - ideal , as the average coulomb energy for the ions is comparable to the thermal energy , or @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , there is substantial ( factors of many ) uncertainty in the diffusion coefficients in these liquid regimes , as the familiar notions of mean free path lose their meaning . in the absence of a definitive calculation of @xmath21 for this situation , bh01 proceeded by estimating @xmath21 for @xmath0 in a c / o plasma by the self - diffusion coefficient , @xmath24 , of the classical one - component plasma ( ocp ) . with this , bh01 then estimated the power released , @xmath25 , by @xmath0sinking for a fixed @xmath0profile .",
    "this calculation suggested that @xmath0sedimentation might release sufficient energy to impact wd cooling .",
    "we now take the next step in addressing this question by performing a self - consistent evolution of both the @xmath0density , @xmath26 , and the wd core temperature , @xmath27 , in wds composed of a single dominant ion species .",
    "we find that @xmath0heating delays the time it takes a wd to cool to a given luminosity . _",
    "the total increase in cooling age by the time the wd completely crystallizes ranges from 0.25 - 1.6 gyr , depending on the value of @xmath21 and the wd mass_.    we also investigate the seismological impact of the @xmath0abundance profile at the time the wd crosses the zz ceti instability strip .",
    "the gradient in @xmath0abundance produces a gradient in the electron mean molecular weight , @xmath28 , that provides an additional buoyancy and alters the brunt - visl frequency , @xmath29 .",
    "_ this contribution alters the pulsation periods of high radial order g - modes by more than the measurement errors_. thus @xmath28 gradient contributions from sedimenting @xmath0cannot be ignored in precision wd pulsation work such as recent contraints on the interior abundance profiles @xcite or @xmath3@xmath12@xmath4reaction rate @xcite .",
    "an unexpected result of our calculations is the interaction between the infalling @xmath0and the outward moving crystal / fluid boundary as the wd cools .",
    "we assume that sedimentation halts in the crystalline interior , forcing @xmath0to accumulate at the crystal / fluid boundary and elevating the abundance there .",
    "this abundance is then frozen as the crystal front moves outward .",
    "the jump in @xmath0abundance at a given location depends on both the rate of @xmath0infall and the rate at which the crystal front moves outward .",
    "this leads to an @xmath0abundance in the crystal regions of the star that _ increases _ outward .",
    "whether or not this profile is subject to an elastic rayleigh - taylor instability remains an open question .    in @xmath30",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we cover the details of how we model the evolution of the @xmath0density , @xmath26 , and the wd core temperature , @xmath27 . we also discuss the current uncertainties in the ocp self - diffusion coefficient used to calculate our @xmath0flow rates .",
    "the details of the numeric evolution of @xmath26 are in @xmath30[sec : diffusion ] . in  [ sec : cool ] we detail the results of our self - consistent calculations .",
    "we first discuss the evolution of @xmath26 , highlighting the influence of @xmath21 , wd mass , and crystallization on the adundance profiles .",
    "we then turn to the thermal evolution of the wd and present our new cooling curves . with the @xmath0abundances in hand",
    ", we estimate in  [ sec : brunt ] the impact @xmath0can have on wd pulsations , focusing on high radial order g - modes .",
    "we close in  [ sec : conclusions ] with a summary of our results and a discussion of unanswered questions .",
    "the appendix discusses the brunt - visl frequency in the deep interior .",
    "the wd interior is a plasma of very degenerate electrons whose corresponding ions may be either in a liquid or crystalline state . for our calculation , we presume that the wd is composed a one component plasma ( ocp ) of ions whose @xmath19 is between 12 and 16 and whose @xmath31 .",
    "we treat @xmath0as a trace species throughout the entire calculation , therefore neglecting its effect on the hydrostatic structure of the wd as the models evolve .",
    "as can be seen from the initial composition profile of a realistic pre - wd model shown in figure [ fig : xinit ] , the @xmath0trace assumption is valid initially and we find that it remains valid at all times considered in our calculations .",
    "the physical state of the ions is specified by the parameter , @xmath32 where @xmath33 g @xmath34 . for @xmath35 ,",
    "the plasma is in a liquid state .",
    "the plasma undergoes a phase transition from the liquid to crystalline states once @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0concentration evolution is governed by mass continuity @xmath37 where @xmath26 and @xmath38 are the local @xmath0density and @xmath0flux respectively .",
    "the flux has two pieces ; the diffusive flux caused by @xmath0density gradients and the drifting flux caused by the inward force , @xmath39 , on @xmath0 , @xmath40 where @xmath21 is the diffusion coefficient of @xmath0 in the background plasma and @xmath41 is the magnitude of the local @xmath0drift velocity .",
    "we assume that @xmath0is no longer able to sink once the wd has crystallized and fix the @xmath0concentration of the crystal to be that of the fluid just prior to crystallization .",
    "thus we do not consider concentration changes due to fractionation upon freezing ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned in bh01 , the microphysical calculation of the diffusion coefficient of @xmath0through a plasma that is representative of wd interior conditions has not yet been performed .",
    "a proper treatment involves the calculation of a trace species diffusing through a multi - component plasma in both the classical and quantum liquid regimes .",
    "the latter will be important in the higher mass wds , where the core becomes a quantum liquid long before crystallization starts ( i.e. while the core is still liquid , @xmath42 ; @xcite ) . in light of these uncertainties , bh01 estimated @xmath21 in two ways . the first was using the stokes - einstein relation for a particle of radius @xmath43 ( taken to be the radius of the charge neutral sphere around @xmath0 ) undergoing brownian motion in a fluid of viscosity @xmath44 , which gives @xmath45 when the fluid is allowed to `` slip '' at the particle / fluid interface .",
    "this estimate works well in liquids , where it is accurate at atomic dimensions @xcite .",
    "the second was to use the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath46 calculated by @xcite for the ocp , where @xmath47 is the ion plasma frequency .",
    "these two estimates differ by 20 - 40 % .",
    "in addition , there is still uncertainty in the ocp self - diffusion coefficient in the regime of interest . to highlight these uncertainties in @xmath24",
    ", we consider calculations of the ocp shear viscosity , @xmath44 , which are related to the ocp self - diffusion coefficient via the stokes - einstein relation .",
    "a summary of shear viscosity calculations for the ocp are presented in figure [ fig : viscosity ] , where we show the reduced viscosity , @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "the results represent a range in calculation techniques ",
    "monte carlo @xcite , kinetic theory @xcite , and molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered a glassy state above the normal crystal transition point , thus their data extends to @xmath50 .",
    "error bars are displayed when there was sufficient information in the literature to determine them . between these results , there is disagreement on the 10 - 30% level .",
    "the solid line displays the analytic result of the ocp ( no - screening ) limit of the yukawa system as calculated by @xcite .",
    "the dotted line shows our fit to the data that reproduces the reduced viscosity implied from @xmath24 of equation ( [ eq : diff ] ) and the stokes - einstein relation in the regime @xmath51 while approximately fitting the data in the of tanaka & ichimaru for @xmath52 .",
    "this fit is given by @xmath53 the first term in equation ( [ eq : etaglfit ] ) is the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath49 inferred from equation ( [ eq : diff ] ) .",
    "we utilize this fit to explore the consequences of wd interiors not crystallizing but instead undergoing a transition to a glassy state .    with all of these uncertainties in mind ,",
    "we follow bh01 and take @xmath55 as our fiducial best guess for the @xmath0diffusion coefficient .",
    "but , as we consider the actual value of @xmath21 to be uncertain even in the case of @xmath0diffusing in a single component plasma , we carry out calculations with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 to determine to what extent a reasonable variation in the diffusion rate may alter the impact of @xmath0sedimentation . although the actual @xmath21 may be less than @xmath24 , we only consider @xmath58 here since for @xmath59 , the impact of @xmath0on wd evolution is irrelevant .",
    "the variation of up to 10 times @xmath24 is probably large for the more typical low mass wds , but for the more massive wds , where the interior plasma can be a quantum liquid over a substantial portion of the wd before it crystallizes , the use of the classical ocp formula may be seriously in error .",
    "once @xmath21 is specified , the downward drift velocity , @xmath41 , of the @xmath0ions under a macroscopic force @xmath60 is @xmath61 where the latter equality holds for @xmath62 .",
    "this is the approximation we use to determine @xmath41 in our calculations . as @xmath63 over most of the stellar radius , the motion of @xmath0is dominated by falling at the local drift velocity set by equation ( [ eq : v ] ) ( bh01 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : v ] ) also allows a rough estimate of the sedimentation timescale .",
    "the time it takes a @xmath0ion to sink from the surface to the center of a constant density star when it falls at the rate given by equation ( [ eq : v ] ) is @xmath64 ( bh01 ) .",
    "using the central densities as an estimate , a pure oxygen(carbon ) @xmath65 wd at @xmath66 has @xmath67 , so that complete @xmath0sedimentation is unlikely for the most common @xmath68 wds .",
    "however , the strong density dependence means that this time decreases for massive wds .",
    "for example , a pure oxygen @xmath69 wd at @xmath70 has @xmath71 .",
    "one caveat of our specification of the relation between @xmath41 and @xmath21 should be mentioned .",
    "our wd model is constructed using a fully degenerate eos everywhere ( with no inclusion of ion contributions in the structure calculation ) and we take initially the @xmath0mass fraction to be @xmath72 = 0.02 everywhere . this choice of model and @xmath0profile confines us to the wd interior where the electron fermi energy @xmath73 .",
    "modeling the outer non - degenerate parts of the star requires a more accurate background model and electric field calculation .",
    "since we are most interested here in the overall energetics , we can safely neglect the role of the thin outer layers .",
    "our wd model consists of a plasma of a single predominant ion species plus a trace amount of @xmath0at a local number density of @xmath74 .",
    "the energetics included are the heat provided by @xmath0sedimentation , latent heat released upon crystallization of the major species , and the wd s radiative losses .",
    "since we are modeling the late ( @xmath75 myr ) evolution , we neglect the slight gravitational energy release as the wd contracts to its final radius .",
    "also , other potential heat sources such as the potential h burning in the inner envelope and fractionation effects are not included for the sake of simplicity as our goal here is to demonstrate the potential impact of @xmath0sedimentation separated from other sources of uncertainty in wd cooling .    the _",
    "net _ power generated per @xmath0ion by the sedimentation process is @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the bulk velocity of the @xmath0flow .",
    "this quantity is different from the drift velocity since we must take into account both diffusive and drifting currents .",
    "thus @xmath78 and the net gravitational energy release is given by @xmath79 where @xmath74 .",
    "the latent heat released upon crystallization is @xmath80 per nuclei @xcite . for the energy lost to radiation",
    ", we use the @xmath81 relations of @xcite . for the heat capacity of the liquid state ,",
    "@xmath82 , we use equation ( 17 ) of @xcite which takes into account the ideal ion and ion - ion interactions .",
    "we neglect the small electron contributions to the heat capacity .",
    "quantum liquid effects are not taken into account . in the solid state",
    "we utilize equation ( 5 ) of @xcite .",
    "since the thermal conduction time across the wd core is much less than the evolution time , we treat all energy sources and sinks as global quantities .",
    "the thermal evolution of the instantaneously isothermal wd at temperature @xmath83 is then @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the mass of the wd that has crystallized .",
    "for a spherically symmetric flow , equation ( [ eq : cont ] ) reads @xmath86 we discretize equation ( [ eq : spcont ] ) according to the prescription @xmath87 @xcite . here",
    "the superscripts refer to the time index and subscripts the spatial index and the factors of two come about from the averaging of @xmath88 between adjacent cells .",
    "the first two terms give the diffusive fluxes through the top and bottom of the mass shell at radius @xmath89 .",
    "the second two terms give the same for the drifting fluxes .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath90 at @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the wd radius .",
    "we use @xmath26 instead of @xmath0concentration as our dependent variable since this simplifies the form of the continuity equation .",
    "the rate at which @xmath0flows through the interior is completely determined by @xmath21 . in the liquid regions of the star , we set @xmath93 ( equation ( [ eq : diff ] ) ) .",
    "the @xmath49 dependence of @xmath24 means that as the wd cools , @xmath21 , and hence @xmath41 , decrease and @xmath0flow slows .",
    "we expect @xmath0diffusion to halt in regions of the wd that have crystallized .",
    "there is thus an abrupt transition in the @xmath0flow rate at the crystal / liquid interface . combined with the fact that the neon concentration is fixed behind the crystal / liquid boundary",
    ", the crystallizing of the wd leaves a significant imprint on the @xmath0concentration profile in the star , as we discuss in  [ sec : cool : diffusion ] .    in order to avoid numerical difficulties",
    ", we handle the transition in the value of @xmath21 to zero in crystallizing regions by smoothing the transition with the formula @xmath94 here @xmath95 sets the factor by which @xmath21 is reduced from @xmath24 in the crystalline state and @xmath96 sets the width in @xmath49 over which the transition from liquid to crystal occur in the @xmath97 shell .    by smoothing out the transition from liquid to crystal states",
    ", we effectively resolve the propagation of the crystal / liquid boundary within a single shell of our grid in the sense that it now takes a finite time for the shell to go from fully liquid to fully crystalline .",
    "this is important because the width of the transition region affects the @xmath0profile near the crystal / liquid boundary .",
    "we choose @xmath98 so that the time it takes for each shell to transition from liquid to crystal ( the transition regime being defined by @xmath99 ) equals the amount of time it takes the crystal front to move across the shell . an easy way of approximating @xmath98 is to consider the @xmath27 at which the adjacent cells in our grid crystallize .",
    "these two temperatures set the lower and upper bounds of the range in @xmath49 in the @xmath100 between which the cell undergoes crystallization . from this @xmath101",
    "is determined by the simple relation @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "for our models , the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : dgamma ] ) is @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we presume that the latent head is released instantaneously when @xmath106 in the shell .    as mentioned prior",
    ", we also utilize the diffusion coefficient implied by the stokes - einstein relation and equation ( [ eq : etaglfit ] ) to calculate the effects of @xmath0diffusion in wds if the interior plasma undergoes a glassy transition instead of crystallizing . in the glassy state",
    ", we expect diffusion to continue .",
    "thus @xmath0sedimentation will continue to generate energy long past the time when sedimentation would have stopped in a crystallized wd .",
    "obviously , such a process has the potential to maintain a wd at a higher luminosity than it otherwise would have at very late times .",
    "we explore this possibility in section [ sec : cool : cool ] .    before including the thermal evolution of the wd",
    ", we performed checks on the accuracy of our algorithm at constant @xmath27 in a @xmath107 mass wd .",
    "the motion of @xmath0over most of the wd is dominated by falling at the local drift speed , @xmath41 , allowing an analytical calculation of the @xmath0concentration as a function of time by considering only the drift contributions to the flux .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 in a thin shell ( at radius @xmath108 and thickness @xmath109 ) . from @xmath110",
    "we calculate the position at later times of @xmath0ions starting at the inner and outer boundaries of this shell .",
    "then , the new @xmath26 in the shell can be calculated from the old @xmath26 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 and the new @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the resulting @xmath72 at @xmath111 gyr is displayed in figure [ fig : xcomp1 ] along with the full numerical results at the same wd age .",
    "the lower panel of the plot displays the relative difference between the two calculations , which show a good agreement in the inner regions of the wd .",
    "we also compared the numeric and analytic results for the diffusive equilibrium of @xmath0 .",
    "with @xmath21 and @xmath41 specified , the @xmath0profiles in diffusive equilibrium ( @xmath112 ) is given by @xmath113 which gives @xmath114\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath115 normalized by total @xmath0mass .",
    "a comparison between this expression and the equilibrium reached in the numeric integration shows very good agreement .",
    "we utilize equation ( [ eq : numcont ] ) and the discretization of equation ( [ eq : tc ] ) @xmath116 to perform the mutual evolution of @xmath27 and @xmath26 numerically . here",
    "@xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 are the luminosity , central temperature , total heat capacity of the wd , and latent heat released during the @xmath100 timestep . in what follows we consider a wd composed of a single ion species as the background .",
    "figure [ fig : xinit ] is typical of the c / o ratio in wd interiors predicted by stellar evolution models .",
    "we can approximate this composition profile by performing calculations taking the entire star to have a mean molecular weight @xmath121 throughout .",
    "therefore we consider in greatest detail the results for models with this composition .      in figure",
    "[ fig : d1x22 ] we show the @xmath0profile evolution in the @xmath107 c / o wd when @xmath62 for 5 different epochs .",
    "the initial @xmath0profile is a horizontal line at @xmath122 .",
    "the major qualitative result of the @xmath0evolution is a significant depletion in the @xmath0concentration in the outer layers of the wd , where the rate of sinking is largest . elsewhere through the star , other than a gradual increase with time ,",
    "the concentration is not much affected , at least as long as the wd remains in the liquid state .",
    "this is to be expected since the sedimentation time for a low mass wd is much longer than the cooling time .",
    "the sedimentation rate is affected by both @xmath21 and @xmath123 .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : x221gyr ] a comparison of the @xmath0profiles in our 0.6 @xmath124 c / o wd at 1 gyr for various values of @xmath21 .",
    "as expected , the larger values of @xmath21 lead to more rapid sedimentation and a faster depletion of @xmath0 in the outer layers of the wd and a stronger gradient in the @xmath0concentration as compared to @xmath62 .",
    "since the sedimentation time decreases with density , @xmath0settles out at a faster rate in more massive wds .",
    "figure [ fig : x22m1 ] shows the @xmath0concentrations at several ages for a 1.0 @xmath124 c / o wd .",
    "two effects compared to the lower mass wd are apparent .",
    "first , as expected , the rate of @xmath0sedimentation is greater leading to much faster depletion in the outer regions and accumulation in the central ones .",
    "but , second , the wd begins crystallizing much sooner ( since the coulomb interactions are greater ) and the star finishes crystallizing at a much younger age .",
    "this limits the extent to which @xmath0is able to settle inward before being frozen in place",
    ".    the depletion of @xmath0 in the outer layers of the wd may play a role in setting the inter - diffusion properties of @xmath3/@xmath4and @xmath125at the core - envelope boundary .",
    "all three of these species have @xmath126 and the macroscopic forces acting them are approximately equal , at least in the degenerate regions of the wd . in these regions ,",
    "significant mixing of @xmath125and the @xmath3/@xmath4 in the core should occur , at least on timescales much longer than typical diffusion times . however , with @xmath0present , the @xmath28 of the core is slightly larger than that of the envelope and @xmath125may be excluded from penetrating into @xmath0rich regions .",
    "but , as @xmath0is evacuated from the outer layers of the core , the buoyant barrier created by @xmath28 gradients between the core and envelope is removed .",
    "thus @xmath0sedimentation might set a natural limit on the depth to which @xmath125can inter - mix with the core plasma , but further work needs to be done to verify if this is truly the case .",
    "the time , @xmath127 , it takes for the @xmath0to evacuate the outer layers of the wd can be approximated by integrating equation ( 4 ) of bh01 @xmath128 over the outer regions of the wd , where we can take @xmath1 constant and the pressure to be dominated by non - relativistic , degenerate electrons . if we make the further assumption that the layer is isothermal over the time it takes a @xmath0ion to fall between the limits of the integral , we find that @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the value of @xmath49 at the mass coordinate @xmath131 , @xmath132 is the mass outside of the depth of the ion , and @xmath123 is the wd mass . equation ( [ eq : deltm ] ) is equivalent to equation ( 6 ) from bh01 , but expressed in terms of mass coordinates .",
    "of interest is the approximate time that it takes the @xmath0to be depleted from the outer @xmath133 of the wd  that is from a region of roughly the same mass as the @xmath125layer on the wd .",
    "taking a 50/50 mixture of @xmath3/@xmath4 in the outer core of the wd , equation ( [ eq : deltm ] ) gives @xmath134 , where @xmath135 at these times in the outer wd .",
    "thus within several gyrs , any barrier to significant @xmath125penetration into the core should be removed .",
    "crystallization leaves an imprint on the @xmath0profile .",
    "the location of the outward moving crystal / fluid boundary can be seen in figure [ fig : d1x22 ] where the jump in @xmath0concentration in the 3 and 4 gyr profiles occurs .",
    "this jump is a result of the halting of @xmath0sedimentation in crystallized regions of the star . at the crystal / fluid interface , @xmath0ions falling through the liquid portion of the star encounter the impenetrable crystal boundary and",
    "as the star cools , the location of the crystal / fluid boundary moves outward , freezing the @xmath0concentration at the level to which it has accumulated .",
    "the question then arises as to what determines the magnitude of the jump in @xmath0concentration at the crystal / fluid boundary , and therefore fixes the @xmath0profile in the crystal portions of the wd .",
    "consider a thin region of thickness @xmath109 in front of the crystal / fluid boundary , located at a radius @xmath136 . at this location , the boundary position is moving outward at a rate @xmath137 , the @xmath0falls towards the interface at a velocity @xmath41 and has a density of @xmath26 . in the time",
    "@xmath138 it takes the crystal boundary to cross the region @xmath109 , the total mass of @xmath0that flows into this region is @xmath139 the @xmath0density in the shell between @xmath140 and @xmath141 after freezing is then @xmath142 or defining @xmath143 @xmath144 since @xmath145 .",
    "this analysis is valid as long as both @xmath26 and @xmath41 are constant over the time it takes to crystallize the shell .",
    "both conditions are satisfied when @xmath146 , i.e. when @xmath147 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : v ] ) gives @xmath41 as a function of @xmath148 , the velocity,@xmath149 , is calculated by considering the density , @xmath150 , at which @xmath151 for a given @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath149 is given by @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the inter - ion spacing defined in section [ intro ] .",
    "this evaluates to @xmath154 where @xmath155 represents the net rate of energy loss in the wd due to all sources and sinks and @xmath156 is calculated from the wd s @xmath157 .",
    "the ratio @xmath158 determines the @xmath0density jump across the liquid / crystal boundary .",
    "how this ratio changes over the wd interior determines the gradient in the @xmath0concentration profile in the crystalline state .",
    "a plot of @xmath158 for the models under consideration is shown in figure [ fig : crysstep ] . the increase in this ratio",
    "outward is due to an increasing @xmath41 near the surface where @xmath149 decreases .",
    "this leads to an inverted @xmath0concentration profile in the crystalline portion of the wd seen in figure [ fig : d1x22 ] .",
    "this @xmath0abundance profile could well be destabilizing , as @xmath28 is increasing outwards .",
    "however the linear stability is complicated by the elastic shear of the crystalline state , which might stabilize a profile that would otherwise be rayleigh - taylor unstable .",
    "further calculations are needed to resolve this question .",
    "one may also ask the question of how the increase in @xmath0at the crystal / fluid boundary affects the role that fractionation plays in wd cooling .",
    "current thought is that under conditions typical of wds , a c / o/@xmath0plasma has liquid and solid phases of equal @xmath0concentration @xcite . when the wd starts to crystallize ,",
    "the resulting phases are an o rich solid and c rich liquid .",
    "the solid is the denser phase and an o rich solid core forms .",
    "it is not until the temperature of the plasma is reduced to 1.12 times the freezing temperature of the pure carbon plasma that @xmath0fractionation begins to occur .",
    "according to @xcite , by this time 70% ( by mass ) of the wd has already crystallized and the additional effects of ne distillation ( see @xcite ) on the cooling process is small .",
    "if the results of @xcite ( i.e. his figure 1 ) are correct , the small increase in @xmath0concentration at the crystal / fluid boundary will not change this scenario . to do so",
    "would require @xmath0concentrations of order @xmath159 , far above the additional increase in @xmath72 at the crystal / fluid boundary exhibited here .",
    "thus , we do not expect @xmath0sedimentation to alter the picture developed to date of the role of @xmath0fractionation in wd cooling .",
    "we have only considered wd models of a single ion species .",
    "more realistic models with varying composition may have interesting effects on the @xmath0profile in the star .",
    "for example , we expect that the viscosity of the interior plasma to increase with increasing @xmath4mass fraction which produces a corresponding change in @xmath41 . in regions where the composition is rapidly changing , for example near 0.5 @xmath124 in figure [ fig :",
    "xinit ] , sharp spikes in the @xmath0composition may occur when the region crystallizes .",
    "the rapid variation in composition may effect the @xmath0flow rates sufficiently in the liquid state to cause local increases in @xmath0concentrations at this stage also .",
    "another way in which the @xmath0profile could be altered is through fractionation of the c / o/@xmath0plasma when crystallization occurs , an effect that we have ignored in this paper .",
    "a full calculation including @xmath0sedimentation and full consideration of the 3 component plasma phase transition is needed to answer the question of how much this may change the final @xmath0profile in the wd .",
    "the effects of @xmath0sedimentation on wd cooling are summarized in figures [ fig : tclgcrys ] and [ fig : ltcrys ] .",
    "figure [ fig : tclgcrys ] shows the instantaneous power generated by @xmath0sedimentation , @xmath25 , in comparison with the luminosity of the wd ( dash - dot line ) as a function of core temperature . shown",
    "are the @xmath25 produced for pure @xmath3and pure @xmath4(solid and dashed lines respectively ) stars as well as a comparison between calculations performed with @xmath62 and @xmath160 ( lower and upper sets of curves ) .",
    "the results for a c / o wd are between the @xmath3and @xmath4wd curves .",
    "the effect of crystallization in halting the @xmath0sedimentation is seen in the sharp change in slope for the @xmath25 curve near @xmath161 k. since @xmath162 , it is seen that this wd always cools .",
    "thus , in the case of low mass wds , the possibility for @xmath0sedimentation to provide a wd s luminosity seems unlikely , at least if wds crystallize as they cool .",
    "in addition , the results for a c / o wd that has a phase change to a glassy state at high @xmath49 values is shown for both masses by the dash - dot line .",
    "as mentioned before , @xmath21 in this case was calculated from equation ( [ eq : etaglfit ] ) and the stokes - einstein relation . that sedimentation continues to generate energy at late time is quite obvious , and in the case of a @xmath124 wd",
    "can dramatically affect the wd s late evolution .",
    "concentrating on the 0.6 @xmath124 , @xmath62 curves for a moment , @xmath25 is substantially less than @xmath163 over most of the evolution of the wd and the effects of @xmath0sedimentation on wd cooling take some time to become apparent .",
    "this is seen in figure [ fig : ltcrys ] where a comparison between the cooling with and without @xmath0settling is shown . not until after about 4 gyr is there a substantial difference in the cooling age of this model .",
    "the fact that the low mass wds crystallize slowly combined with slow @xmath0sedimentation cause the delays from @xmath0sedimentation to increase until the wd is completely crystalline ( which occurs at about @xmath164 in this model ) .",
    "the total delay in cooling that occurs for this model is about 0.25 gyr by 10 gyr .",
    "we also indicate the approximate location of the zz ceti instability strip in this figure by the horizontal dashed line .",
    "the @xmath0profile at the time at which the wd crosses this location is needed to determine the potential effects that @xmath0sedimentation may have on the seismological properties of the star ( see  [ sec : brunt ] ) .    as found by bh01 ,",
    "the competition between the heating due to @xmath0and the energy output of the wd is much closer in the more massive wds , as exemplified by the 1.0 @xmath124 model in the lower panel of figure [ fig : tclgcrys ] .",
    "however , in all cases we examined ( including calculations with @xmath165 in the 1.0 @xmath124 model ) , the power generated by @xmath0sedimentation never exceeded the luminosity of the wd .",
    "thus it appears improbable in all but maybe the most massive wds that @xmath0sedimentation would be able to power the wd .",
    "however , the early competition between the @xmath0heating and radiative losses does show up in the cooling curves as will be seen in a moment .    the overall impact of @xmath0on the cooling of the more massive wds due to this rapid sedimentation is mitigated by the equally rapid crystallization in these stars , as exhibited by the earlier turnover in the @xmath25 curves in these models .",
    "we can also see a qualitative differences in the effect of @xmath0sedimentation on differing mass models from this plot . in the lower mass wds ,",
    "@xmath0sedimentation is a slower , enduring process which takes substantial time to compete with cooling at a significant level .",
    "but , @xmath25 in this case stays competitive with @xmath163 for a longer period of time . for the higher mass stars , sedimentation is fast and @xmath25 is large initially but drops off quickly .    in the 1.0 @xmath124 model ,",
    "the @xmath165 exhibits the effects of rapid @xmath0depletion in the outer layers of the wd .",
    "the extremely rapid sedimentation in this model leads to a large delay in the cooling time early on as compared to the other models which include sedimentation effects .",
    "but , as the @xmath0is depleted from the outer layers in this model , energy generation due to sedimentation decreases compared to the models with smaller diffusion coefficients and the relative delays between them decrease at late times .",
    "the effects of these differences are seen in the cooling curves shown in figure [ fig : ltcrys ] . for clarity",
    ", data is only shown for wds with @xmath121 ; results for pure @xmath3and @xmath4wds bracket these results .",
    "both plots show the effects of varying @xmath21 over the range of @xmath166 along with a model that neglects @xmath25 ( the bottom curve in each ) and a model that undergoes a transition to a glassy state instead of crystallizing ( dotted curve ) .",
    "as could be expected from figure [ fig : tclgcrys ] , the delays introduced in the @xmath107 model only grow significant at late times , whereas those of the @xmath167 model are apparent early .",
    "these delays continue until the wds have almost fully crystallized , which occurs by the time @xmath168 for the @xmath169 models .",
    "a summary of the increase in cooling ages , @xmath127 , for these models is in figure [ fig : delays ] .",
    "each panel shows the difference between the age of our @xmath121 models with @xmath170 ( solid lines , bottom to top , respectively ) and one without @xmath0diffusion included .",
    "in the 1.0 @xmath124 model , the early termination of increases in @xmath127 in the @xmath171 and @xmath165 models as compared to the @xmath62 model is the results of rapid depletion of @xmath0 in the outer layers of the wd .",
    "so , there is little @xmath0left to sediment out in the remaining liquid regions of the wd before the wd completely crystallizes .",
    "the dash - dot line in figure [ fig : delays ] shows the difference in age between the reference model and a wd that undergoes a glassy transition . for a period",
    "while the reference model is undergoing crystallization , the glassy wd model is actually _ younger _ than the reference model .",
    "the explanation for this is that the glassy wd does not liberate latent heat , which is a much more significant quantity of energy while the reference star is crystallizing .",
    "once the crystallization process is finished , the continued release of energy from @xmath0sedimentation in the glassy wd produces the age increases seen ( at least in combination with the rapid cooling that the crystallized wd undergoes once it enters the debye cooling regime ) . in the glassy wd models , the increase in wd age for a given luminosity continue to increase indefinitely and would lead to an abundance of faint wds greater than would otherwise be expected .      from equation ( [ eq : lg ] ) ,",
    "the power generated by @xmath0sedimentation is proportional to @xmath0number density .",
    "the delays in cooling time produced by @xmath0sedimentation will thus vary with the metallicity of the wd progenitor .",
    "a particular example where this may be observationally relevant is the open cluster ngc 6791 .",
    "ngc 6791 is interesting both because is it old ( @xmath172 gyr ) and metal _ rich _ , @xmath173=0.4 $ ] @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:06ltczcomp ] shows a comparison in the @xmath25 generated in the 0.6 @xmath124 @xmath121 wd models whose progenitor s metallicity were solar ( as in the prior calculations ) or @xmath174 , as is appropriate for wds within ngc6791 . shown in figure [ fig:06ltzcomp ]",
    "is the comparison of cooling curves between these wds .",
    "as is readily seen , wds whose progenitors were metal rich will be more affected by the effects of @xmath0sedimentation .",
    "this will be especially true if @xmath21 is significantly larger than our fiducial best guess of @xmath24 .",
    "can this seen ?",
    "most likely , yes , if a massive ( @xmath175 ) is found , as these should be equal in age to the cluster since their massive progenitors had such short lives .",
    "figure [ fig : ngc6791cmd ] shows the location of a @xmath176 wd in the cluster cmd for different values of @xmath21 but all at a fixed age of 8 gyr .",
    "the deceleration of the aging process is evident , as the @xmath62 model is @xmath177 mags brighter than the model without diffusion included . for comparison the effects on the more typical lower mass wds",
    "are also shown .",
    "the fact that @xmath0sedimentation s effects on the wd cooling sequence is metallicity dependent also provides the most straightforward means of separating it from other uncertainties in wd cooling . to our knowledge",
    ", no other uncertainty has as significant dependence on the metal content of the wd as @xmath0sedimentation .",
    "the only other effect that might is the fractionation of @xmath0during crystallization .",
    "but , according to @xcite , the extent to which this effect matters is much smaller than that due to c / o fractionation and in any case occurs only after the larger portion of the wd has crystallized .",
    "separating the delays in wd cooling due to @xmath0from other contributions is difficult in the absence of observational comparisons between metal rich and metal poor wds . in the low mass wds , at the point where @xmath0 s effects become apparent ,",
    "the star has already begun crystallizing and the uncertain energy releases from fractionation can occur . in the high mass stars , especially for large @xmath0diffusion rates , there is a window between 1 - 4 gyrs in which @xmath0sedimentation can have an extremely significant impact on the cooling age of the wd . to be fair , here again ,",
    "crystallization has already started in these stars , but the potential magnitude of @xmath0contributions may allow separation of @xmath0and fractionation effects .    although not yet feasible , potentially the clearest test of @xmath0sedimentation s impact on wd cooling in particular , and wd cooling theory in general , would be the construction of empirical cooling curves for wds of specified masses .",
    "as the overall morphology of the cooling curves can depend on which effects are included and their magnitudes , this may provide at least a qualitative means of determining empirically which phenomenon are operative in wds .",
    "such a comparison would require a large sample of confirmed wds homogeneous in mass and metallicity and whose cooling ages are determined independently of their luminosity .",
    "typical @xmath0abundance profiles at the time our wd models reach the zz ceti instability strip are shown in figure [ fig : neprofiles ] .",
    "the abundance gradient in @xmath0creates a gradient in the mean molecular weight per electron , @xmath28 , that provides an extra restoring force for the g - modes .",
    "we now show that this modifies the pulsation periods at levels comparable to the uncertainties of the measurements . to see this ,",
    "we start with the brunt - visl frequency @xmath178 \\;,\\ ] ] @xcite where @xmath179 is one of the adiabatic indices . for an isothermal background of degenerate , relativistic electrons , and an ideal ion gas ( the coulomb corrections to @xmath180 are small ; @xcite ) and a @xmath28 gradient that depends only on the gradients of the trace @xmath0 , we find ( see appendix ) @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 is the ion mean molecular weight .",
    "the first piece is the thermal contribution to @xmath180 ( previously known to be small in the deep interior ; @xcite ) while the second is the @xmath0contribution .",
    "figure [ fig:10brunt ] shows @xmath180 for a 1 @xmath184 wd with @xmath185 for @xmath62 and @xmath186 at the point its @xmath187 k ( the ages of the two models are 1.2 and 1.5 gyr respectively ) . for this plot , we improved upon equation ( [ eq : n2rel ] ) by explicitly calculating @xmath188 using the fully degenerate equation of state instead of using either limiting approximations ( see appendix ) .",
    "the high pressure limit is set by the location of the crystal / fluid boundary , which effectively acts as a hard - sphere boundary @xcite .",
    "the solid horizontal lines show selected mode periods of the only solar mass zz ceti known , bpm 37093 @xcite .",
    "it is clear that these observed modes probe the region of the wd interior in which @xmath0gradients make their largest contribution to @xmath180 .",
    "the contribution from the @xmath0abundance profile affects @xmath29 over the interior and thus the periods of the longer period modes that penetrate deeply .",
    "we estimate the extent to which @xmath0sedimentation affects the mode frequencies by performing the integral @xmath189 through the liquid wd interior ( the envelope s contribution to the integral is @xmath190 ) . using only the thermal contribution to @xmath180 gives @xmath191 through the wd core .",
    "the same core integral evaluated taking into account the @xmath0gradient gives @xmath192 for @xmath62 and @xmath193 for @xmath186 , or a total change in the interior integral of 8 - 30% .",
    "adding the envelope contribution tells us that @xmath0sedimentation can affect pulsation periods by greater than 1% , or over 100 times larger than the measurement error .",
    "the effects of @xmath0sedimentation in a @xmath194 wd are about 0.6% , or 4 seconds for 700 second modes , at the levels where work is already in progress ( e.g. @xcite ) . the question of whether or not the seismological effects of @xmath0gradients can be separated from those due to the uncertainties in the c / o profile and envelope layer thicknesses will have to wait until detailed models are made that include the @xmath0contributions .",
    "it seems probable that once this is done , it will be seen that distinguishing between theoretical mode spectra calculated with or without @xmath0gradient contributions is possible based on the fact that the @xmath0gradients introduce a new spike in the brunt - visl frequency in the wd interior . whether or not pulsation studies will be able to confirm the presence of such gradients in real wds remains to be answered .",
    "with two extra neutrons ( over and above the @xmath195 ratio of the background ions ) , the diffusion of @xmath0is biased inward in the liquid interior of wds .",
    "the impact of this sedimentation on wd cooling was first estimated by bh01 .",
    "we have extended their work by calculating the mutual evolution of the @xmath0density , @xmath26 , and core temperature , @xmath27 , for wd models composed of a single background ion species .",
    "the heating produced by @xmath0increases the cooling age of our models on order of 0.2 - 1.5 gyr ( see figure [ fig : delays ] ) depending on the value of @xmath21 .",
    "we have also performed initial estimates of the effects that @xmath0abundance gradient can have on the pulsation modes of wds .",
    "although more precise work needs to be done , these initial calculations indicate that the corrections to mode periods due to @xmath28 gradients impact the results at the current level of observational precision .",
    "the uncertainty in the actual value of the diffusion coefficient produces a large uncertainty in the possible impact @xmath0may have on wd evolution .",
    "the significant impact that @xmath0sedimentation may have on ages of recently formed wds provides clear astrophysical motivation for authoritative calculations for the @xmath21 of @xmath0through a multicomponent plasma .",
    "hopefully further theoretical work in this direction will eliminate this source of uncertainty .",
    "observations can constrain the diffusion rate of @xmath0 in wd interiors .",
    "for example , say the age of a wd is known because of its membership in a cluster .",
    "its luminosity will then depend on the rate at which @xmath0sinks and on the overall amount of @xmath0present in the wd ( see equation ( [ eq : lg ] ) ) .",
    "also the amount by which the brightness of the wd will be affected is very dependent on the wds mass , as can be seen by the differences between the 0.6 and 1.0 @xmath124 cooling curves in figure [ fig : ltcrys ] .",
    "having an independent measure of these four quantities ( @xmath123 , @xmath163 , wd age , and @xmath72 ) can allow meaningful tests of our theory .",
    "the main uncertainty in wd cooling , namely fractionation effects , do not come into play until a large portion of the wd has crystallized and do not seem to be a function of @xmath0concentration ( at least for @xmath196 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "increases in wd luminosity over that expected from the canonical cooling theory for times prior to crystallization or which show a strong metallicity dependence are most readily interpreted as the effects of @xmath0sedimentation .",
    "the question is whether or not @xmath0can affect the wd luminosity to a measurable degree in the regimes where fractionation is unimportant .",
    "one place we might look are massive young wds . for ages between 14 gyrs ,",
    "the @xmath163 of such objects is strongly dependent on @xmath21 .",
    "but , on the other hand , these wds begin to crystallize in this time frame . for @xmath197 , c / o fractionation effects may dominate over @xmath0sedimentation , at least if @xmath198 ( @xcite and see also figure [ fig : delays ] ) . for larger values of @xmath21",
    "though , these wds will be maintained at a high enough temperature that fractionation becomes significantly less important at these times .",
    "the other place we might look for the effects of @xmath0are in wds born from metal rich progenitors . in this case , the effects on @xmath0sedimentation even in the lower mass wds are more readily apparent and may be observable .    the data required for either of the above two observational programs can be obtained for wds that are members of open clusters . in this case",
    ", the age of the wd can be inferred from the difference between the cluster s turn - off age and the main sequence lifetime of it progenitor , if the wd mass is known .",
    "the cluster s metallicity constrains the @xmath0content of the wds . to date , though , the actual quantity of data for confirmed wd cluster members is rather scarce .",
    "a compilation of such objects was performed by von hippel in 1998 @xcite . in this sample ( which is still seemingly complete )",
    ", there is only one wd ( g152 in ngc 2682 ) with a mass or @xmath1 determination in a cluster older than 1 gyr @xcite .",
    "the other 27 objects all reside in clusters younger than this . of these , there are about 5 - 6 wds with masses greater than 0.9 @xmath124 and several ( most notably the two wd members of ngc 2168 ) whose mass determination are highly suspect @xcite .",
    "obviously , it would be ideal to increase the number of known wds in clusters with a wider range of ages than we have currently .",
    "such a program should be a priority if for no other reason than the need for a direct observational test of wd cooling theory in general .    in the past seven years or so ,",
    "the number of wd candidates in open clusters have grown substantially due to the series of deep ( limiting magnitudes of 24 - 26 in the @xmath199 band ) photometric studies of open clusters that several groups have undertaken @xcite . the goal of these studies is to provide a determination of cluster ages using the age of the oldest wd candidates found in each cluster .",
    "identification of an object as a wd is based on the object s location in the cluster s color - magnitude diagram and on it having a spatial morphology that is stellar in nature ( as opposed to one that is galactic ",
    "contamination of the wd sequence with faint blue galaxies in these studies is one of the difficulties encountered)@xcite . to date",
    ", no follow up spectroscopy to confirm these objects aras wds and to make mass determinations if they are has been done , although the cfht group has future plans to do so @xcite .",
    "overall the number of new wd candidates added by these studies is around 300 objects .",
    "the clusters studied so far range in age from 0.5 - 7 gyrs .",
    "it is worth noting that only one of the 19 clusters in the cfht survey has an age greater than 1 gyr @xcite .",
    "follow up spectroscopy on clusters outside of the cfht sample is thus highly desirable . as mentioned earlier , the cluster ngc 6791 is an extremely interesting target due to its high metal content . to our knowledge",
    ", there have been no wd candidates identified in this cluster and discovery of a wd sequence in ngc 6791 could provide a ready test of our theory since the effects of @xmath0on wd cooling will be greatly amplified there .",
    "we would like to thank peter heflich for providing the pre - wd evolutionary models from which we based our discussion of wd composition , leandro althaus for providing the @xmath200 relations used in our calculations , and james liebert for a critical reading of our manuscript .",

    "<S> the subsequent gravitational energy released slows the cooling of the wd by 0.251.6 gyrs by the time it has completely crystallized , depending on the wd mass and the adopted sedimentation rate . </S>",
    "<S> the effects will make massive wds or those in metal rich clusters ( such as ngc 6791 ) appear younger than their true age . </S>",
