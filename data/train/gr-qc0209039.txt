    "the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) is a deep - space mission , jointly proposed to the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) and the european space agency ( esa ) , to detect and study gravitational radiation in the millihertz frequency band .",
    "lisa will use coherent laser beams exchanged between three remote , widely separated , spacecraft . modeling each spacecraft as carrying lasers , beam splitters , photo - detectors , and drag - free proof masses on each of two optical benches ,",
    "it has been shown @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that the six measured time series of doppler shifts of the one - way laser beams between spacecraft pairs , and the six measured shifts between adjacent optical benches on each spacecraft , can be combined , with suitable time delays , to cancel the otherwise overwhelming frequency fluctuations of the lasers ( @xmath3 ) , and the noise due to the mechanical vibrations of the optical benches ( which could be as large as @xmath4 ) . the achievable strain sensitivity level @xmath5 is set by the buffeting of the drag - free proof masses inside each optical bench , and by the shot noise at the photo - detectors .",
    "in contrast to earth - based , equi - arm interferometers for gravitational wave detection , lisa will have multiple readouts .",
    "the data they generate , when properly time shifted and linearly combined , provide observables that are not only insensitive to laser frequency fluctuations and optical bench motions , but also show different couplings to gravitational radiation and to the remaining system noises @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the space of all possible interferometric combinations can be generated by properly combining four generators @xcite , and it has been shown to be an _ algebraic module _ @xcite . in this paper",
    "we derive from first principles a particular combination of these generators which , for a given waveform and source location in the sky , give maximum signal - to - noise ratio . in this respect",
    ", lisa should no longer be regarded as a single detector , but rather as an array of interferometers working in coincidence .",
    "an outline of the paper is presented here .",
    "section ii provides a brief summary of time - delay interferometry , the data processing technique needed to remove the frequency fluctuations of the six lasers used by lisa . after showing that the entire set of interferometric combinations can be derived by properly combining four generators , ( @xmath6 ) , in section",
    "iii we turn to the problem of optimization of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) within this functional space . as an application",
    ", we apply our results to the case of sinusoidal signals randomly polarized and randomly distributed on the celestial sphere .",
    "we find that the standard lisa sensitivity figure derived for a single michelson interferometer @xcite can be improved by a factor of @xmath0 in the low - part of the frequency band , and by more than @xmath2 in the remaining part of the accessible band . in section",
    "iv we present our comments and conclusions .",
    "figure 1 shows the overall lisa geometry .",
    "the spacecraft are labeled @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and distances between pairs of spacecraft are @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being opposite spacecraft @xmath14 .",
    "unit vectors between spacecraft are @xmath15 , oriented as indicated in figure 1 .",
    "we similarly index the relative frequency fluctuations @xmath16 data to be analyzed : @xmath17 is the relative frequency fluctuations time series measured at reception at spacecraft @xmath7 with transmission from spacecraft @xmath8 ( along @xmath12 ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath18 is the corresponding time series derived from reception at spacecraft @xmath7 with transmission from spacecraft @xmath9 .",
    "the other four one - way relative frequency time series from signals exchanged between the spacecraft are obtained by cyclic permutation of the indices : @xmath7 @xmath19 @xmath8 @xmath19 @xmath9 @xmath19 @xmath7 . the useful notation for delayed data streams",
    "will be also used : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , etc .",
    "( units in which @xmath22 ) .",
    "six more doppler difference series result from laser beams exchanged between adjacent optical benches within each spacecraft ; these are similarly indexed as @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) .    the light paths for the @xmath25 s and @xmath26 s can be traced in figure 2 .",
    "an outgoing light beam transmitted to a distant spacecraft is routed from the laser on the local optical bench using mirrors and beam splitters ; this beam does not interact with the local proof mass .",
    "conversely , an _ incoming _ light beam from a distant spacecraft is bounced off the local proof mass before being reflected onto the photo - detector where it is mixed with light from the laser on that same optical bench .",
    "these data are denoted @xmath17 and @xmath18 in figure 2 .",
    "beams exchanged between adjacent optical benches however do precisely the opposite .",
    "light to be _ transmitted _ from the laser on an optical bench is _ first _ bounced off the proof mass it encloses and then directed via fiber optics to the other optical bench . upon reception",
    "it does _ not _ interact with the proof mass there , but is directly mixed with local laser light .",
    "they are @xmath27 and @xmath28 in figure 2 .",
    "the frequency fluctuations introduced by the gravitational wave signal , the lasers , the optical benches , the proof masses , the fiber optics , and the measurement itself at the photo - detector ( shot noise ) enter into the doppler observables @xmath16 , @xmath23 with specific time signatures .",
    "they have been derived in the literature @xcite , @xcite , and we refer the reader to those papers for a detailed discussion .",
    "the doppler data @xmath16 , @xmath23 are the fundamental measurements needed to synthesize all the interferometric observables unaffected by laser and optical bench noises .     and @xmath27 .",
    "the right hand bench analogously reads out @xmath18 and @xmath28 .",
    "the random velocities of the two proof masses and two optical benches are indicated ( lower case @xmath29 for the proof masses , upper case @xmath30 for the optical benches.),width=480 ]    the simplest such combination , the totally symmetrized sagnac response @xmath31 , uses all the data of figure 2 symmetrically @xmath32 and its transfer functions to gravitational waves and instrumental noises were derived in @xcite , and @xcite respectively . in particular , @xmath31 has a `` six - pulse response '' to gravitational radiation , i.e. a @xmath33-function gravitational wave signal produces six distinct pulses in @xmath31 @xcite , which are located with relative times depending on the arrival direction of the wave and the detector configuration .",
    "together with @xmath31 , three more interferometric combinations , ( @xmath34 ) , jointly generate the entire space of interferometric combinations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "their expressions in terms of the measurements @xmath16 , @xmath23 are as follows @xmath35 with @xmath36 , and @xmath37 derived by permuting the spacecraft indices in @xmath38 .",
    "like in the case of @xmath31 , a @xmath33-function gravitational wave produces six pulses in @xmath38 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .    we should remind the reader that the four interferometric responses ( @xmath6 ) satisfy the following relationship @xmath39 jointly they also give the expressions of the interferometric combinations derived in @xcite , @xcite : the unequal - arm michelson ( @xmath40 ) , the beacon ( @xmath41 ) , the monitor ( @xmath42 ) , and the relay ( @xmath43 ) responses @xmath44 with the remaining expressions obtained from equations ( [ eq:4 ] , [ eq:5 ] , [ eq:6 ] , [ eq:7 ] ) by permutation of the spacecraft indices .",
    "all these interferometric combinations have been shown to add robustness to the mission with respect to failures of subsystems , and potential design , implementation , or cost advantages @xcite , @xcite .",
    "all the above interferometric combinations have been shown to individually have rather different sensitivities @xcite , as a consequence of their different responses to gravitational radiation and system noises .",
    "lisa has the capability of observing a gravitational wave signal with many different interferometric combinations , all having different antenna patterns and noises .",
    "we should thus no longer regard lisa as a single detector system but rather as an array of gravitational wave detectors working in coincidence .",
    "this suggests that the presently adopted lisa sensitivity could be improved by _ optimally _ combining the four generators ( @xmath6 ) . in mathematical terms",
    "this can be restated by saying that we should be able to find that particular combination of the four generators that has maximum signal - to - noise ratio to a given gravitational wave signal .    in order to proceed with this idea ,",
    "let us consider the following linear combination @xmath45 of the fourier transforms of the four generators ( @xmath46 ) @xmath47 where the @xmath48 are arbitrary complex functions of the fourier frequency @xmath49 , and of a vector @xmath50 containing parameters characterizing the gravitational wave signal ( source location in the sky , waveform parameters , etc . ) and the noises affecting the four responses ( noise levels , their correlations , etc . ) .",
    "for a given choice of the four functions @xmath51 , @xmath52 gives an element of the functional space of interferometric combinations generated by ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "our goal is therefore to identify , for a given gravitational wave signal , the four functions @xmath51 that maximize the signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath53 , of the combination @xmath52 @xmath54 in equation ( [ eq:9bis ] ) the subscripts @xmath55 and @xmath56 refer to the signal and the noise parts of ( @xmath57 ) respectively , the angle brackets represent noise ensemble averages , and the interval of integration ( @xmath58 ) corresponds to the frequency band accessible by lisa .    before proceeding with the maximization of the @xmath53 we may notice from equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) that the fourier transform of the totally symmetric sagnac combination , @xmath59 , multiplied by the transfer function @xmath60 can be written as a linear combination of the fourier transforms of the remaining three generators ( @xmath61 ) . since the signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath52 and @xmath62 are equal , we may conclude that the optimization of the signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath52 can be performed only on the three observables @xmath63 .",
    "this implies the following redefined expression for @xmath53 @xmath64 the @xmath53 can be regarded as a functional over the space of the three complex functions @xmath65 , and the particular set of complex functions that extremize it can of course be derived by solving the associated set of euler - lagrange equations .    in order to make the derivation of the optimal snr easier ,",
    "let us first denote by @xmath66 and @xmath67 the two vectors of the signals ( @xmath68 ) and the noises ( @xmath69 ) respectively .",
    "let us also define @xmath70 to be the vector of the three functions @xmath71 , and denote with @xmath72 the hermitian , non - singular , correlation matrix of the vector random process @xmath73",
    "@xmath74 if we finally define @xmath75 to be the components of the hermitian matrix @xmath76 , we can rewrite @xmath53 in the following form @xmath77 where we have adopted the usual convention of summation over repeated indices . since the noise correlation matrix @xmath72 is non - singular , and the integrand is positive definite or null , the stationary values of the signal - to - noise ratio",
    "will be attained at the stationary values of the integrand , which are given by solving the following set of equations ( and their complex conjugated expressions ) @xmath78 = 0 \\ \\ \\ , \\ \\ \\ k = 1 , 2 , 3 \\ . \\label{eq:16bis}\\ ] ] after taking the partial derivatives , equation ( [ eq:16bis ] ) can be rewritten in the following form @xmath79    \\ ( { \\bf a}^*)_i \\ \\ \\ , \\ \\",
    "\\ i = 1 , 2 , 3   \\label{eq:16tris}\\ ] ] which tells us that the stationary values of the signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath52 are equal to the eigenvalues of the the matrix @xmath80 .",
    "the result in equation ( [ eq:16bis ] ) is well known in the theory of quadratic forms , and it is called the rayleigh s principle @xcite , @xcite .    in order now to identify the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath80 , we first notice that the @xmath81 matrix @xmath82 has rank @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that the matrix @xmath83 has also rank @xmath7 , as it is easy to verify .",
    "therefore two of its three eigenvalues are equal to zero , while the remaining non - zero eigenvalue represents the solution we are looking for .",
    "the analytic expression of the third eigenvalue can be obtained by using the property that the trace of the @xmath81 matrix @xmath83 is equal to the sum of its three eigenvalues , and in our case to the eigenvalue we are looking for . from these considerations",
    "we derive the following expression for the optimized signal - to - noise ratio @xmath84 @xmath85 we can summarize the results derived in this section , which are given by equations ( [ eq:9],[eq:18 ] ) , in the following way :    \\(i ) among all possible interferometric combinations lisa will be able to synthesize with its four generators @xmath6 , the particular combination giving maximum signal - to - noise ratio can be obtained by using only three of them , namely ( @xmath63 ) ;    \\(ii ) the expression of the optimal signal - to - noise ratio given by equation ( [ eq:18 ] ) implies that lisa should be regarded as a network of three interferometer detectors of gravitational radiation ( of responses ( @xmath34 ) ) working in coincidence @xcite .      as an application of equation ( [ eq:18 ] ) , here we calculate the sensitivity that lisa can reach when observing sinusoidal signals uniformly distributed on the celestial sphere and of random polarization . in order to calculate the optimal signal - to - noise ratio we will also need to use a specific expression for the noise correlation matrix @xmath72 . as a simplification",
    ", we will assume the lisa arm - lengths to be equal to its nominal value @xmath86 , the optical - path noises to be equal and uncorrelated to each other , and finally the noises due to the proof - mass noises to be also equal , uncorrelated to each other and to the optical - path noises . under these assumptions",
    "the correlation matrix becomes real , its three diagonal elements are equal , and all the off - diagonal terms are equal to each other , as it is easy to verify by direct calculation @xcite .",
    "the noise correlation matrix @xmath72 is therefore uniquely identified by two real functions , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , in the following way @xmath89    the expression of the optimal signal - to - noise ratio assumes a rather simple form if we diagonalize this correlation matrix by properly `` choosing a new basis '' .",
    "there exists an orthogonal transformation of the generators ( @xmath61 ) which will transform the optimal signal - to - noise ratio into the sum of the signal - to - noise ratios of the `` transformed '' three interferometric combinations .",
    "the expressions of the three eigenvalues @xmath90 ( which are real ) of the noise correlation matrix @xmath72 can easily be found by using the algebraic manipulator _ mathematica _",
    "@xcite , and they are equal to @xmath91 note that two of the three real eigenvalues , ( @xmath92 ) , are equal .",
    "this implies that the eigenvector associated to @xmath93 is orthogonal to the two - dimensional space generated by the eigenvalue @xmath94 , while any chosen pair of eigenvectors corresponding to @xmath94 will not necessarily be orthogonal",
    ". this inconvenience can be avoided by choosing an arbitrary set of vectors in this two - dimensional space , and by ortho - normalizing them .",
    "after some simple algebra , we have derived the following three ortho - normalized eigenvectors @xmath95 equation ( [ eq:21 ] ) implies the following three linear combinations of the generators ( @xmath96 ) @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 are italicized to indicate that these are `` orthogonal modes '' .",
    "although the expressions for the modes @xmath98 and @xmath99 depend on our particular choice for the two eigenvectors ( @xmath101 ) , it is clear from our earlier considerations that the value of the optimal signal - to - noise ratio is unaffected by such a choice . from equation ( [ eq:22 ] ) it is also easy to verify that the noise correlation matrix of these three combinations is diagonal , and that its non - zero elements are indeed equal to the eigenvalues given in equation ( [ eq:20 ] ) .    in order to calculate the sensitivity corresponding to the expression of the optimal signal - to - noise ratio , we have proceeded similarly to what was done in @xcite , @xcite , and described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "we assume an equal - arm lisa ( @xmath102 light seconds ) , and take the one - sided spectra of proof mass and aggregate optical - path - noises ( on a single link ) , expressed as fractional frequency fluctuation spectra , to be ( @xcite , @xcite ) , @xmath103}^{-2 } \\",
    "hz^{-1}$ ] and @xmath104}^2 \\ hz^{-1}$ ] , respectively .",
    "we also assume that aggregate optical path noise has the same transfer function as shot noise .",
    "the optimum snr is the square root of the sum of the squares of the snrs of the three `` orthogonal modes '' ( @xmath105 ) . to compare with previous sensitivity curves of a single lisa michelson interferometer",
    ", we construct the snrs as a function of fourier frequency for sinusoidal waves from sources uniformly distributed on the celestial sphere . to produce the snr of each of the ( @xmath105 ) modes we need the gravitational wave response and the noise response as a function of fourier frequency .",
    "we build up the gravitational wave responses of the three modes ( @xmath105 ) from the gravitational wave responses of ( @xmath34 ) . for @xmath106 fourier frequencies in the @xmath107 hz to @xmath108 hz lisa band , we produce the fourier transforms of the gravitational wave response of ( @xmath63 ) from the formulas in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the averaging over source directions ( uniformly distributed on the celestial sphere ) and polarization states ( uniformly distributed on the poincar sphere ) is performed via a monte carlo method . from the fourier transforms of the ( @xmath34 ) responses at each frequency",
    ", we construct the fourier transforms of ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "we then square and average to compute the mean - squared responses of ( @xmath105 ) at that frequency from @xmath109 realizations of ( source position , polarization state ) pairs .",
    "the noise spectra of ( @xmath105 ) are determined from the raw spectra of proof - mass and optical - path noises , and the transfer functions of these noises to ( @xmath105 ) . using the transfer functions given in @xcite , the resulting spectra are equal to @xmath110 s^{proof\\ mass}_y(f ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\ 8 \\ \\sin^2(\\pi f l ) \\ [ 2 + \\cos(2 \\pi f",

    "the snr for , e.g. @xmath98 , @xmath113 , at each frequency @xmath49 is equal to @xmath112 times the ratio of the root - mean - squared gravitational wave response at that frequency divided by @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the bandwidth conventionally taken to be equal to @xmath7 cycle per year . finally ,",
    "if we take the reciprocal of @xmath116 and multiply it by @xmath117 to get the conventional @xmath118 sensitivity criterion , we obtain the sensitivity curve for this combination which can then be compared against the corresponding sensitivity curve for the equal - arm michelson interferometer .    in figure 3",
    "we show the sensitivity curve for the lisa equal - arm michelson response ( @xmath118 ) as a function of the fourier frequency , and the sensitivity curve from the optimum weighting of the data described above : @xmath119 .",
    "the snrs were computed for a bandwidth of 1 cycle / year .",
    "note that at frequencies where the lisa michelson combination has best sensitivity , the improvement in signal - to - noise ratio provided by the optimal combination is slightly larger than @xmath0 .",
    "in figure 4 we plot the ratio between the optimal snr and the snr of a single michelson interferometer . in the long - wavelength limit , the snr improvement is @xmath0 . for fourier frequencies greater than or about equal to @xmath120 ,",
    "the snr improvement is larger and varies with the frequency , showing an average value of about @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , for bands of frequencies centered on integer multiples of @xmath120 , @xmath121 contributes strongly and the aggregate snr in these bands can be greater than @xmath8 .    in order to better understand the contribution from the three different combinations to the optimal combination of the three generators , in figure 5 we plot the signal - to - noise ratios of ( @xmath122 ) as well as the optimal signal - to - noise ratio . for an assumed @xmath123 ,",
    "the snrs of the three modes are plotted versus frequency . for the equal - arm case computed here ,",
    "the snrs of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are equal across the band . in the long wavelength region of the band ,",
    "modes @xmath98 and @xmath99 have snrs much greater than mode @xmath100 , where its contribution to the total snr is negligible . at higher frequencies",
    ", however , the @xmath100 combination has snr greater than or comparable to the other modes and can dominate the snr improvement at selected frequencies .",
    "the use of time - delay interferometry has shown that lisa has the capability to simultaneously observe gravitational waves in the millihertz band with several , and rather different , interferometric data combinations . in this paper",
    "we have identified , for a given ( but otherwise arbitrary ) gravitational wave signal , the particular interferometric combination that gives maximum signal - to - noise ratio . in this context",
    "we have actually shown that lisa should no longer be regarded as a single - instrument mission , but rather as a network of interferometer detectors of gravitational radiation working in coincidence .",
    "we have identified the general expression of the optimal combination of the generators ( @xmath34 ) , which should be used when observing a specified gravitational wave signal .    under rather general assumptions on the properties of the noise correlation matrix , and for sinusoidal gravitational wave signals that are randomly distributed over the celestial sphere and over the polarization states , we have found that the sensitivity gain of the optimal data combination over that of the michelson combination can be significant , and it varies over the frequency band accessible by lisa . in the low part of the frequency band",
    "such improvement is equal to @xmath0 , and it grows to values larger than @xmath2 at higher frequencies and in small frequency bands centered on frequencies that are integer multiple of the inverse of the one - way light - travel time .",
    "the results derived in this paper will have immediate application to the solution of the so called `` inverse problem '' for lisa , that is to say the determination of the source location and of the wave s two independent amplitudes from the data lisa will be able to generate .",
    "we will estimate the accuracies in the determination of the source location and of the wave s amplitudes that the optimal combination of the three interferometric responses ( @xmath34 ) derived in this paper will imply .",
