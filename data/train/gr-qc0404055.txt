    "ever since bekenstein@xcite and hawking@xcite argued that a black hole has an entropy @xmath1 which is a quarter of its horizon area @xmath2 it has been a challenge to theoretical physicists to explain what this is an entropy of . in recent years candidate theories of quantum gravity",
    "have provided concrete realizations of quantum mechanical microstates .",
    "both string theory@xcite and loop quantum gravity@xcite have given derivations for the bekenstein - hawking entropy .    in this article",
    "we will describe how one can fix a free parameter , known as the immirzi@xcite parameter , to obtain the exact bekenstein - hawking result for the entropy in loop quantum gravity .",
    "we will do this using an input from classical relativity , namely the quasinormal mode spectrum of black holes .",
    "the first three sections of this paper deal with this argument . the following sections then deal with rotating black holes and also discuss a new insight into the problem that relies on supersymmetry .",
    "the reaction of a black hole to perturbations is dominated by an infinite discrete set of damped oscillation called quasinormal modes@xcite .",
    "one remarkable feature of the quasinormal mode spectrum for non - rotating black holes is that the real part of the frequency approaches the non - zero value @xmath3 as the damping increases ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "a non - rotating black hole has thus associated with it one distinguished frequency . one",
    "might then ask if there is a special process in the underlying quantum theory that gives rise to this particular frequency .",
    "we will come back to this question after having taken a closer look at loop quantum gravity .",
    "in loop quantum gravity a surface is thought to acquire area through the punctures of spin network edges .",
    "spin networks form the basis of the hilbert space of lqg .",
    "they consist of graphs whose edges are labelled by representations of the gauge group of the theory . in our case",
    "this is su(2 ) ( or so(3 ) ) .",
    "the labels are thus ( half-)integers .",
    "for a puncture with label @xmath4 the area is @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the planck length .",
    "the free parameter @xmath7 is the so - called immirzi@xcite parameter .",
    "one can think of the horizon area of a black hole to be the result of a large number of spin network edges puncturing the horizon surface .",
    "the hilbert space of the theory living on the boundary is increased by each puncture .",
    "if the edge has a label @xmath4 the dimension of the hilbert space increases by a factor of @xmath8 .",
    "the statistically most important contribution comes from the lowest possible spin @xmath9 .",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space is thus @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of punctures . since the area due to one puncture is @xmath12 ( see formula ( [ eqn : area ] ) ) this number @xmath11 is given by @xmath13 .",
    "the entropy of the black hole is thus @xmath14 the entropy is proportional to the area but the result so far is not satisfactory since it contains the free parameter @xmath7 .",
    "when discussing the high damping limit of the quasinormal mode frequencies we asked the question whether there could exist a quantum mechanical process that could give rise to the the limiting frequency @xmath15 . given the picture developed in the last section such a process is easy to imagine .",
    "it is the appearance or disappearance of a puncture of the horizon ( see figure [ fig2 ] * * ) .",
    "as hod@xcite pointed out , the emission of a quanta of frequency @xmath15 would change the area of a non - rotating black hole by @xmath16 .",
    "this has to be equated with the change in area @xmath12 due to one puncture .",
    "this equation fixes the immirzi parameter and gives for the entropy @xmath17 we see that we obtain exactly the bekenstein - hawking result if @xmath18 .",
    "this can be achieved if one chooses so(3 ) as the gauge group instead of su(2)@xcite .",
    "wheelers@xcite `` it from bit '' gets thus modified to `` it from trit '' ( see figure [ fig2]b ) .",
    "in the last section we have used quasinormal modes to learn something about the quantum mechanics of non - rotating black holes . a new argument by hod@xcite tries to go the other way .",
    "this time the quantum mechanics of black holes is used to gain insight into the quasinormal mode spectrum of a rotating black hole .",
    "the starting point is the first law of black hole mechanics @xmath19 using the expressions in the kerr metric for the temperature @xmath20 and the angular velocity @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are the horizon radii , together with the identification @xmath23 and @xmath24 one obtains an expression for re@xmath25 from equation ( [ eqn : flaw ] ) : @xmath26 we thus obtain a prediction for how the frequency re@xmath25 changes as a function of the rotation parameter @xmath27 .    to check the validity of this prediction hod",
    "compared it to numerical data obtained by onozawa@xcite , who used numerical techniques developed by leaver@xcite .",
    "the graph obtained is reproduced in figure [ fig3 ] using our own numerical data .",
    "the two graphs match well .",
    "the largest deviation occurs at the origin .",
    "this is to be expected since we are looking at low damping .",
    "it is assumed that the situation improves for larger damping .",
    "this is not the case though for the largest damping we have tested .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] * * shows quasinormal modes for @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] * * then shows the re@xmath29 plot , this time including all the values of @xmath30 .",
    "none of the graphs shows a good matching with the theoretical prediction .",
    "in section [ sec : fix ] we saw that we could get perfect agreement of the loop quantum gravity calculation with the bekenstein - hawking result provided we change the gauge group from su(2 ) to so(3 ) .",
    "this step is problematic since it is not clear how to include fermions in such a theory . using supersymmetric spin networks ling and",
    "zhang@xcite were able to circumvent this problem .",
    "for supersymmetric spin networks the area spectrum is @xmath31 and the dimension of the representation spaces is @xmath32 . using the same arguments as above ling and zhang",
    "obtain the following result for the entropy : @xmath33 exact agreement is thus obtained for @xmath34 .",
    "we have seen how the classical theory of quasinormal modes could be used to fix an ambiguity in loop quantum gravity .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment of black holes in loop quantum gravity will be required to see how real this connection is .",
