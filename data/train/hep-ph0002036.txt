    "investigation of the symmetry breaking mechanism of the electroweak @xmath2 gauge symmetry will be one of the prime tasks of the lhc .",
    "correspondingly , major efforts have been concentrated on devising methods for higgs boson discovery , for the entire mass range allowed within the standard model ( sm ) ( 100  gev@xmath3  tev , after lep2 ) , and for higgs boson search in extensions of the sm , like the mssm  @xcite .",
    "while observation of one or more higgs scalar(s ) at the lhc appears assured , discovery will be followed by a more demanding task : the systematic investigation of higgs boson properties . beyond observation of the various cp even and cp odd scalars which nature may have in store for us ,",
    "this means the determination of the couplings of the higgs boson to the known fermions and gauge bosons , i.e. the measurement of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 couplings , to the extent possible .",
    "clearly this task very much depends on the expected higgs boson mass . for @xmath10  gev and within the sm , only the @xmath11 and @xmath1 channels",
    "are expected to be observable , and the two gauge boson modes are related by su(2 ) . above @xmath12  gev",
    ", where detector effects will no longer dominate the mass resolution of the @xmath13 resonance , additional information is expected from a direct measurement of the total higgs boson width , @xmath14",
    ". a much richer spectrum of decay modes is predicted for the intermediate mass range , i.e. if a sm - like higgs boson has a mass between the reach of lep2 ( @xmath15  gev ) and the @xmath16-pair threshold .",
    "the main reasons for focusing on this range are present indications from electroweak precision data , which favor @xmath17  gev  @xcite , as well as expectations within the mssm , which predicts the lightest higgs boson to have a mass @xmath18  gev  @xcite .    until recently ,",
    "the prospects of detailed and model independent coupling measurements at the lhc were considered somewhat remote  @xcite , because few promising search channels were known to be accessible , for any given higgs boson mass . taking atlas search scenarios as an example , these were  @xcite [ eq : gghaa ] ggh , m_h 150  gev , + [ eq : gghzz ] gghzz^*4,m_h 130  gev , and [ eq : gghww ] gghww^*|| , m_h 150  gev , with the possibility of obtaining some additional information from processes like @xmath19 and/or @xmath20 associated production with subsequent @xmath21 and @xmath22 decay for higgs boson masses near 100  gev . throughout",
    "this paper , `` @xmath23 '' stands for inclusive higgs production , which is dominated by the gluon fusion process for a sm - like higgs boson .",
    "this relatively pessimistic outlook is changing considerably now , due to the demonstration that weak boson fusion is a promising higgs production channel also in the intermediate mass range .",
    "previously , this channel had only been explored for higgs masses above 300  gev .",
    "specifically , it was recently shown in parton level analyses that the weak boson fusion channels , with subsequent higgs decay into photon pairs  @xcite , [ eq : wbfhaa ] qqqqh , h , m_h 150  gev , into @xmath24 pairs  @xcite , [ eq : wbfhtautau ] qqqqh , h , m_h 140  gev , or into @xmath25 pairs  @xcite [ eq : wbfhww ] qqqqh , hww^(*)e^^/_t , m_h 120  gev , can be isolated at the lhc .",
    "preliminary analyses , which try to extend these parton level results to full detector simulations , look promising  @xcite .",
    "the weak boson fusion channels utilize the significant background reductions which are expected from double forward jet tagging  @xcite and central jet vetoing techniques  @xcite , and promise low background environments in which higgs decays can be studied in detail .",
    "the parton level results predict highly significant signals with ( substantially ) less than 100  fb@xmath0 .",
    "the prospect of observing several higgs production and decay channels , over the entire intermediate mass range , suggests a reanalysis of coupling determinations at the lhc  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we attempt a first such analysis , for the case where the branching fractions of an intermediate mass higgs resonance are fairly similar to the sm case , i.e. we analyze a sm - like higgs boson only .",
    "we make use of the previously published analyses for the inclusive higgs production channels  @xcite and of the weak boson fusion channels  @xcite .",
    "the former were obtained by the experimental collaborations and include detailed detector simulations .",
    "the latter are based on parton level results , which employ full qcd tree level matrix elements for all signal and background processes .",
    "we will not discuss here differences in the performance expected for the atlas and cms detectors nor details in the theoretical assumptions which lead to different estimates for expected signal and background rates .",
    "the reader is referred to the original publications from which numbers are extracted . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we summarize expectations for the various channels , including expected accuracies for cross section measurement of the various signals for an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath0 .",
    "implications for the determination of coupling ratios and the measurement of higgs boson ( partial ) decay widths are then obtained in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "a final summary is given in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "[ table : gg.aa ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the first precision test of the higgs sector is provided by taking ratios of the @xmath26 s and ratios of the @xmath27 s . in these ratios",
    "the qcd uncertainties , and all other uncertainties related to the initial state , like luminosity and pdf errors , cancel . beyond testing @xmath28-universality",
    ", these ratios provide useful information for higgs masses between 100 and 150  gev and 120 to 150  gev , respectively , where more than one channel can be observed in the weak boson fusion and gluon fusion groups .",
    "typical errors on these cross section ratios are expected to be in the 15 to 20% range ( see table  [ table : xyratio ] ) . accepting an additional systematic error of about 20%",
    ", a measurement of the ratio @xmath29 , which determines the @xmath4 to @xmath7 coupling ratio , can be performed , by measuring the cross section ratios @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "expected accuracies are listed in table  [ table : xyratio ] . in these estimates",
    "the systematics coming from understanding detector acceptance is not included .    beyond the measurement of coupling ratios ,",
    "minimal additional assumptions allow an indirect measurement of the total higgs width .",
    "first of all , the @xmath32 partial width , properly normalized , is measurable with an accuracy of order 10% .",
    "the @xmath32 is a third generation fermion with isospin @xmath33 , just like the @xmath34-quark . in all extensions of the sm with a common source of lepton and quark masses ,",
    "even if generational symmetry is broken , the ratio of @xmath34 to @xmath32 yukawa couplings is given by the fermion mass ratio .",
    "we thus assume , in addition to @xmath28-universality , that    * the ratio of @xmath34 to @xmath32 couplings of the higgs is given by their mass ratio , i.e. y = _ b _",
    "= 3c_qcdg_hbb^2g_h^2 = 3c_qcdm_b^2(m_h)m_^2 , where @xmath35 is the known qcd and phase space correction factor . *",
    "the total higgs width is dominated by decays to @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , i.e. the branching ratio for unexpected channels is small : = 1- ( & & b(hb|b)+b(h)+b(hww^(*))+ + & & b(hzz^(*))+b(hgg)+b(h ) ) 1 .    note that , in the higgs mass range of interest , these two assumptions are satisfied for both cp even higgs bosons in most of the mssm parameter space .",
    "the first assumption holds in the mssm at tree level , but can be violated by large squark loop contributions , in particular for small @xmath42 and large @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "the second assumption might be violated , for example , if the @xmath44 partial width is exceptionally large .",
    "however , a large up - type yukawa coupling would be noticeable in the @xmath29 coupling ratio , which measures the @xmath4 coupling .    with these assumptions",
    "consider the observable @xmath45 where @xmath46 is determined by combining @xmath47 and the product @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 provides a lower bound on @xmath50 .",
    "provided @xmath51 is small ( @xmath52 suffices for practical purposes ) , the determination of @xmath49 provides a direct measurement of the @xmath53 partial width .",
    "once @xmath54 has been determined , the total width of the higgs boson is given by [ eq : gamma_tot ] = _ w^2x_w=1x_w ( x_(1+y ) + x_w(1+z ) +",
    "x_+ x_g ) ^2 1(1-)^2 . for a sm - like higgs boson",
    "the higgs width is dominated by the @xmath21 and @xmath53 channels .",
    "thus , the error on @xmath49 is dominated by the uncertainties of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 measurements and by the theoretical uncertainty on the @xmath34-quark mass , which enters the determination of @xmath57 quadratically . according to the particle data group , the present uncertainty on the @xmath34",
    "quark mass is about @xmath58  @xcite . assuming a luminosity error of @xmath59 in addition to the theoretical uncertainty of the weak boson fusion cross section of @xmath59 , the statistical errors of the @xmath60 and @xmath61 cross sections of tables  [ table : wbf.tautau ] and [ table : wbf.ww ] lead to an expected accuracy of the @xmath49 determination of order 10% .",
    "more precise estimates , as a function of the higgs boson mass , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : widthaccurcy ] .     of data in each experiment .",
    "results are shown for the extraction of the the @xmath1 partial with , @xmath54 , and and the total higgs boson width , @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath51 is the sum of the residual ( small ) branching ratios of unobserved channels , mainly @xmath63 ( see text for detail).,width=340 ]    the extraction of the total higgs width , via eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_tot ] ) , requires a measurement of the @xmath64 cross section , which is expected to be available for @xmath65  gev  @xcite .",
    "consequently , errors are large for higgs masses close to this lower limit ( we expect a relative error of @xmath66 for @xmath67  gev and @xmath68 ) . but for higgs boson masses around the @xmath38 threshold , @xmath69 can be determined with an error of about 10% .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : widthaccurcy ] and look highly promising .",
    "in the last section we have found that various ratios of higgs partial widths can be measured with accuracies of order 10 to 20% , with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath0 per experiment .",
    "this translates into 5 to 10% measurements of various ratios of coupling constants .",
    "the ratio @xmath70 measures the coupling of down - type fermions relative to the higgs couplings to gauge bosons . to the extent that the @xmath9 triangle diagrams are dominated by the @xmath25 loop , the width ratio @xmath71 measures the same relationship .",
    "the fermion triangles leading to an effective @xmath72 coupling are expected to be dominated by the top - quark , thus , @xmath29 probes the coupling of up - type fermions relative to the @xmath7 coupling .",
    "finally , for higgs boson masses above @xmath73  gev , the absolute normalization of the @xmath7 coupling is accessible via the extraction of the @xmath53 partial width in weak boson fusion .",
    "note that these measurements test the crucial aspects of the higgs sector .",
    "the @xmath7 coupling , being linear in the higgs field , identifies the observed higgs boson as the scalar responsible for the spontaneous breaking of @xmath2 : a scalar without a vacuum expectation value couples to gauge bosons only via @xmath74 or @xmath75 vertices at tree level , i.e. the interaction is quadratic in scalar fields .",
    "the absolute value of the @xmath7 coupling , as compared to the sm expectation , reveals whether @xmath76 may be the only mediator of spontaneous symmetry breaking or whether additional higgs bosons await discovery . within the framework of the mssm",
    "this is a measurement of @xmath77 , at the @xmath78 level .",
    "the measurement of the ratios of @xmath79 and @xmath80 then probes the mass generation of both up and down type fermions .",
    "the results presented here constitute a first look only at the issue of coupling extractions for the higgs .",
    "this is the case for the weak boson fusion processes in particular , which prove to be extremely valuable if not essential .",
    "our analysis is mostly an estimate of statistical errors , with some rough estimates of the systematic errors which are to be expected for the various measurements of ( partial ) widths and their ratios .",
    "a number of issues need to be addressed in further studies , in particular with regard to the weak boson fusion channels .    * the weak boson fusion channels and their backgrounds",
    "have only been studied at the parton level , to date .",
    "full detector level simulations , and optimization of strategies with more complete detector information is crucial for further progress . * a central jet veto has been suggested as a powerful tool to suppress qcd backgrounds to the color singlet exchange processes which we call weak boson fusion . the feasibility of this tool and its reach need to be investigated in full detector studies , at both low and high luminosity . * in the weak boson fusion studies of @xmath1 and @xmath81 decays , double leptonic @xmath82 and @xmath83 signatures have not yet been considered .",
    "their inclusion promises to almost double the statistics available for the higgs coupling measurements , at the price of additional @xmath84jets and drell - yan plus jets backgrounds which are expected to be manageable . * other channels , like @xmath19 or @xmath20 associated production with subsequent decay @xmath85 or @xmath22 ,",
    "provide additional information on higgs coupling ratios , which complement our analysis at small higgs mass values , @xmath86  gev  @xcite .",
    "these channels need to be included in the analysis . *",
    "much additional work is needed on more reliable background determinations . for the @xmath87 channel in particular , where no narrow higgs resonance peak can be reconstructed ,",
    "a precise background estimate is crucial for the measurement of higgs couplings .",
    "needed improvements include nlo qcd corrections , single top quark production backgrounds , the combination of shower monte carlo programs with higher order qcd matrix element calculations and more . *",
    "both in the inclusive and wbf analyses any given channel contains a mixture of events from @xmath23 and @xmath88 production processes .",
    "the determination of this mixture adds another source of systematic uncertainty , which was not included in the present study . in ratios of @xmath89 observables ( or of different @xmath27 )",
    "these uncertainties largely cancel , except for the effects of acceptance variations due to different signal selections .",
    "since an admixture from the wrong production channel is expected at the 10 to 20% level only , these systematic errors are not expected to be serious .",
    "* we have only analyzed the case of a single neutral , cp even higgs resonance with couplings which are close to the ones predicted in the sm . while this case has many applications , e.g. for the large @xmath42 region of the mssm , more general analyses , in particular of the mssm case , are warranted and highly promising .",
    "while much additional work is needed , our study clearly shows that the lhc has excellent potential to provide detailed and accurate information on higgs boson interactions .",
    "the observability of the higgs boson at the lhc has been clearly established , within the sm and extensions like the mssm .",
    "the task now is to sharpen the tools for accurate measurements of higgs boson properties at the lhc .",
