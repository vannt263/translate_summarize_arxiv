    "sbs0335 - 052 is a blue compact dwarf galaxy at a redshift of 0.0136 , @xcite , a distance of 54.3 mpc and with an apparent v magnitude of 16.65 @xcite .",
    "the close group of super star clusters ( sscs ) in the galaxy s center has been and currently is the subject of intense scrutiny .",
    "@xcite , hereinafter tskev , provides a recent summary of previous observations and investigations of the sscs in sbs0335 - 052e .",
    "part of the attention is due to the extremely low metallicity of the galaxy .",
    "the metallicity , as measured by 12 + log(o / h ) , in sbs0335 - 052e ranges between 7.20 and 7.31 @xcite .",
    "sbs0335 - 052e has the fourth lowest metallicity of any star forming galaxy , surpassed only by its western component sbs0335 - 052w with the lowest measured metallicity , j0956 + 2849 , and the well known i zw 18 @xcite .",
    "because of its low metallicity and its now intense star formation , possibly due to an encounter with the nearby giant spiral galaxy ngc 1376 , it represents star formation and feedback in an environment very much like star formation in the early universe .",
    "sbs0335 - 052e is obviously in a very early stage of its star formation since the observed stellar mass of @xmath2 m@xmath3 is only about 1/25 of the gas mass of @xmath4 m@xmath3 which is again small relative to the dynamical mass of @xmath5 m@xmath3 @xcite , most of which must be dark matter .",
    "a main conclusion of tskev was that the majority of photo - ionizing radiation from the stars in the actively star forming sscs is absorbed within a few stellar radii thus delaying the onset of negative feedback due to photo - ionization .",
    "this conclusion is validated in the present study under the assumption that the diffuse pa@xmath0 flux around the sscs s1 and s2 is due to in - situ stars and not from ionizing flux leaking out of the sscs .",
    "the tskev study relied heavily on _ hubble space telescope _ near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( hst nicmos ) camera 3 observations of sbs0335 - 052e which were part of the sings @xcite large survey of nearby galaxies .",
    "the 0.2pixel scale of camera 3 is not sufficient to resolve much of the detail of the feedback mechanism on star formation operating in the clusters to get a higher spatial resolution near infrared picture of the sscs new observations with the 0.075pixel scale nicmos camera 2 were taken in the pa@xmath0 and h@xmath1 filters .",
    "the primary goal of this work is to study in detail the feedback effect of the photoionizing flux generated in the super star clusters on past and current star formation .",
    "this study also utilizes archival nicmos camera 2 images in pa@xmath0 and the broad band filters f160w and f205w from observations taken by k. johnson ( see   [ s - obs ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - map ] shows the location of all of the sources discussed in this paper .",
    "sources s1-s6 are the sources originally designated from wfpc2 images in @xcite .",
    "the sources s3-pa@xmath0 , s7 and s8 are names ascribed by this work .",
    "s3-pa@xmath0 is considered a separate source from s3 as it is offset from the continuum source s3 and is most likely a completely separate source .",
    "s7 is the source that was designated by a question mark ( ? ) in tskev and s8 is diffuse source about @xmath6 west of s1 and s2 .",
    "unfortunately this source is marked as s7 in @xcite who did not have the spatial resolution to resolve the source we designate as s7 as a separate source .",
    "unlike the nicmos camera 3 images used in tskev the new , much higher resolution , nicmos camera 2 images clearly resolve s1 and s2 and detect the separation between s3 and s3-pa@xmath0 .",
    "sources s3-pa@xmath0 and s7 only appear as slight extensions of the continuum emission in figure  [ fig - map ] but are clearly shown in the pa@xmath0 contours in figure  [ fig - mcon ] .",
    "the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) image in figure  [ fig - mcon ] is an archival acs solar blind channel ( sbc ) image in the uv f140lp filter @xcite which is also discussed in tskev .",
    "the new observations presented in this paper were taken with the hst nicmos camera 2 in 4 narrow band filters ( f187n , f190n , f212n and f215n ) centered at 1.87 @xmath7 , 1.90 @xmath7 , 2.12  and 2.15  ( proposal i d 10856 ) .",
    "these filters are designed to measure pa@xmath0 and the h@xmath1 s(1 ) lines in the f187n and f212n filters respectively .",
    "the redshift of sbs0335 - 052 , however , shifts these lines to the f190n and f215n filters with the shorter wavelength filters acting as the continuum filters .",
    "the program executed in 8 orbits .",
    "exposures were taken in all 4 filters in each orbit without moving hst during an orbit . during each earth",
    "occultation the telescope was dithered one step in a spiral dither pattern with a dither step of @xmath8 .",
    "the f190n filter which images the strong pa@xmath0 emission had an integration time of 320 seconds ( step32 , nsamp=17 ) and the remaining filters all had integration times of 768 seconds ( step64 , nsamp=20 ) in each orbit for a total of 2560 seconds for the f190n filter and 6144 seconds in each of the remaining filters .",
    "the field of view of the nicmos camera 2 is @xmath9 by @xmath10 which easily encompasses all of the known sscs .",
    "additional archival images in the f160w , f205w , f187n and f190n filters ( k. johnson proposal i d 10894 ) , @xcite , were also retrieved .",
    "there are 8 images in the f160w and f205w filters .",
    "the f160w images use step16 with 26 samples and the f205w images use step16 with 24 samples for integration times of 304 and 272 seconds respectively .",
    "there are 16 on target images in the f187n and f190n filters , again with step16 and 26 samples for f187n and 25 samples for f190n for integration times of 304 and 288 seconds .",
    "the total integration times of the archival images are : f160w , 2432 seconds ; f205w , 2176 seconds ; f187n , 4864 seconds ; f190n , 4600 seconds .",
    "archival acs hrc and wfc1 images of sbs0335 - 052 from proposal 10575 ( pi goran stlin ) in f220w , f330w , f550 m , f435 m filters and the fr656 ramp filter were also retrieved from the stsci mast archive .",
    "the combined drizzled images are used with no further processing .",
    "these images along with previous f122 m and f140lp images from proposal 9470 ( pi daniel kunth ) have been used by @xcite to make h@xmath0 and ly@xmath0 images .",
    "table  [ tbl - obs ] gives a summary of the observational parameters of the images used in this analysis .",
    "parallel to the nicmos observations , images of the spiral galaxy ngc 1376 in 8 medium band filters were taken with the acs wfc .",
    "two images in one of the 8 filters were taken in each orbit .",
    "the acs observations will be described in a separate publication .",
    "sbs0335 - 052 is probably engaged in a minor merger with ngc 1376 and the images were taken to see if there is any evidence of the interaction .",
    "no obvious signs of tidal disruption were seen in the ngc 1376 images . given the small mass of sbs0335 - 052 relative to ngc 1376 the absence of any disruption is not surprising .",
    "all of the images were reduced with the nicmos idl based pipeline procedures operating on the raw frames as described in @xcite .",
    "the new images and the archival images were aligned separately since they were at different orientations and had separate dither patterns .",
    "the new images were aligned using offsets determined from the f190n image .",
    "the position of the point - like object s1 , described below , was determined by centroiding with the idl procedure idp3 @xcite for each image . the same offsets were used for the other images in each orbit since hst was not moved during an orbit .",
    "the images in each filter were offset in idp3 to the position of the images in the first orbit and then median combined . during processing",
    "visual inspection showed that two images , one line image and one continuum image , were affected by a cosmic ray persistence streak .",
    "this occurs when there is a strong cosmic ray event before the integration begins and the image of the event persists in subsequent images .",
    "the pixels involved in the event were identified and then not used in the formation of the median image .",
    "this means that the median is formed from only 7 images rather than 8 for those pixels .",
    "the archival images were aligned separately , using the image of s1 in each filter as the fidelity of the pointing between images was not accurately known .",
    "subtraction of the associated narrow filter continuum image from the image in the emission line filter produces an emission line image .",
    "the continuum images are scaled by the known responses of the line and continuum filters and detector qe and subtracted from the line image to produce a continuum free image .",
    "the spacing between the narrow line and continuum filters is only 0.03 microns therefore the spectral slope of the seds , determined from the ground based spectra of @xcite , has a negligible effect on the calculated line power .",
    "the pa@xmath0 image is the f190n image minus the scaled f187n image and the h@xmath1 image is the f215n image minus the scaled f212n image .",
    "the archival line emission images were reduced in the same manner and then rotated and shifted to match the new line images .",
    "a straight average was taken of the two images for the final line emission images .",
    "the f187n image determines the continuum level near the pa@xmath0 emission to measure the pa@xmath0 equivalent widths given in table  [ tbl - ne2v ] .",
    "the archival wide filter continuum images were also rotated and shifted to match the new images .",
    "a median of all of the dithered f205w images was produced with no shifts to produce a median sky image .",
    "the median sky was then subtracted from the f205w image to remove the thermal sky and instrument background .",
    "contour plots of the acs uv f140lp image from the data of @xcite and contour plots of the new nicmos continuum and line images are shown in figure  [ fig - mcon ] .",
    "figure  [ fig - pa ] shows the images of pa@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , and the f160w continuum , along with acs uv f140lp image . in these figures north",
    "is up in all cases .",
    "source s8 does not appear in these figures due to the smaller size of the maps and images .",
    "one aspect of sbs0335 - 052e , as pointed out earlier by @xcite , is that the majority of the star formation has occurred in very compact regions rather than being spread diffusely over the region as occurs in the orion star forming complex in our own galaxy .",
    "three of the sources s1 , s5 and s6 display airy rings indicative of a point - source .",
    "we use nicmos camera 2 observations of known single sources observed to determine the nicmos camera 2 psf to get an estimate of the true size of these sources . for the size of the pa@xmath0 emission we use",
    "the psf star gd-71 observed in the f190n filter and for the continuum we use the psf star hd 3670 observed in f160w filter .",
    "the psf image of gd-71 is a median combination of 4 images at separate positions on the camera 2 detector array .",
    "the images were shifted to a common position using idp3 .",
    "idp3 uses bi - cubic interpolation to resample and shift the images .",
    "the hd 3670 psf image is the addition of two images again shifted and resampled in idp3 .",
    "each of these images were then resampled in an 8 times finer pixel scale , again by bi - cubic interpolation in idp3 .",
    "the images of s1 , s5 and s6 were then also resampled in the same way for comparison with the psf star images .",
    "the two resampled psf star images were next convolved with 2d gaussians with fwhm values of 3/8 , 5/8 , 3/4 , and 15/16 of the _ original _ camera 2 0.075pixel size .",
    "the radial profiles of the original psf , the convolved psf and the object images at the 8 times finer scale were calculated in idp3 and then plotted in figure  [ fig - size ] .",
    "the convolved radial profiles were visually compared with the source profiles to determine the source size .",
    "the comparisons were only made in the inner @xmath11 of the profile to avoid significant contamination from the diffuse background .",
    "we did not attempt to subtract the background since it is non - uniform with significant structure , particularly for the pa@xmath0 background .",
    "the source s1 is resolved in both the continuum and in pa@xmath0 and is consistent with the radial profile of a gaussian source with a fwhm of @xmath12 to @xmath13 convolved with the nicmos psf . at the 54.3 mpc distance of sbs0335 - 052 @xcite the radius of s1 , taken as",
    "1/2 of the fwhm of the gaussian , is between 16 and 18 pc .",
    "this is 4 to 5 times larger than the radius of s1 estimated in tskev based on the acs f140lp image .",
    "that estimate was simply done by eye without a similar analysis using convolved psfs and was clearly an underestimate .",
    "this does not , however , alter any of the conclusions in tskev , other than the speculation on the formation of intermediate mass black holes .",
    "the s1 continuum source may be slightly more compact than the paschen @xmath0 but the difference is less than the error in comparing the observed profile with the broadened psf profiles .",
    "the known `` breathing '' of the hst secondary mirror produces temporal changes of the psf that are approximately plus and minus half the spacing between the psf profile and the first broadened profile .",
    "the comparison may also be influenced by the extensive diffuse emission in the area .",
    "the faint source s6 is also resolved with a size similar to s1 determined in the same manner as for s1 .",
    "source s5 is not resolved in this image .",
    "it is consistent with a point source with an upper limit on the radius of 10 pc .",
    "it does not have any paschen @xmath0 emission and is therefore probably not undergoing intense star formation .",
    "all of these sources have sizes consistent with current day globular clusters and are most likely the young predecessors of globular clusters .",
    "the sources s1-s7 lie in a roughly north - south alignment with the northern most source s6 separated from the southern most source s1 by approximately @xmath14 which is 490 pc at 54.3 mpc .",
    "a supernova cavity lies about @xmath15 (  1kpc ) north of source s1 .",
    "there appears to be a progression of ages of the clusters along the north - south axis ( thuan , izotov & lipovetsky 1997 , tskev ) starting with the supernova cavity in the north to the very young sources s1 and s2 which has lead to the speculation that the sscs are the result of triggered star formation propagating from the north to the south ( tskev ) . in the following discussion",
    "we have arbitrarily divided the sources into sources with pa@xmath0 emission and those without .",
    "we could have equally well divided the sources into compact ( sscs ) and extended .",
    "in fact the compact sources without pa@xmath0 emission are most likely older versions of the compact sources with pa@xmath0 emission .",
    "five sources , s1 , s2 , s3-pa@xmath0 , s7 and s8 along with a diffuse background have detectable pa@xmath0 emission and hence measurable star formation rates .",
    "unlike in tskev the high resolution nicmos camera 2 images accurately determine the distribution of pa@xmath0 flux between s1 and s2 .",
    "in addition to the pa@xmath0 flux associated with the continuum emission of s1 and s2 , the images also show diffuse background pa@xmath0 emission in the region of s1 and s2 which was not evident in the previous lower spatial resolution observations .",
    "the total diffuse pa@xmath0 flux is comparable to the sum of the fluxes from the sources and is due to either in - situ ionizing stars or to ionizing radiation that has leaked from the sources s1 and s2 .",
    "the former is more likely than the latter ( see   [ ss - ds1ds2 ] ) . if the emission is due to ionization by in - situ stars it is not clear whether it is due to a diffuse distribution of individual stars or a distribution of smaller clusters that is not resolved in the present observations .",
    "two types of photometry were carried out on the sources .",
    "the first is aperture photometry with a 5 pixel diameter ( 0.378 ) that encompasses all of the flux inside the first airy ring of a point source .",
    "this is @xmath16 of the total flux of a point source in the f160w filter and @xmath17 in the f190n filter .",
    "larger apertures begin to infringe on adjacent sources . to first order",
    "adjacent sources add approximately the same flux to the aperture as falls outside the aperture from the primary sources .",
    "we therefore do not correct the aperture flux for the percentage of primary object flux in the aperture .",
    "the background was measured in annular rings 3 pixels thick around the sources .",
    "the inner and outer diameters of the annular rings were adjusted to avoid flux from adjacent sources .",
    "the measured backgrounds , adjusted to the area of the photometric aperture were subtracted from the source flux . the photometric error is taken as @xmath18 of the total flux for the bright compact sources and is dominated by the systematics of source overlap and background subtraction .",
    "the equivalent widths were similarly measured in a 6 pixel ( 0.454 ) diameter aperture .",
    "the continuum measure for the equivalent widths is provided by the narrow band f187n filter which is adjacent to the f190n band that measures the pa@xmath0 flux .",
    "this filter accurately measures the continuum level at the location of the pa@xmath0 line and is free of other contaminating emission lines .",
    "the larger aperture was used to increase the signal to noise of the measurements in the f187n filter which has much lower flux than the pa@xmath0 filter or the broad band f160w filter .",
    "the smaller aperture photometry agreed within their signal to noise ratios with the larger aperture measurements .",
    "table  [ tbl - flux ] gives the line and continuum fluxes for all of the sources along with the equivalent widths of the pa@xmath0 line .",
    "it is evident that the equivalent widths of the extended sources s7 and s8 are significantly higher than for the compact sources s1 and s2 .",
    "again note that s7 is the source denoted by a question mark in tskev and s8 is the source marked s7 in @xcite .",
    "unlike in tskev the new observations are deep enough to detect the faint continuum associated with the extended sources and are of high enough resolution to discern the offset between the continuum and line emission in s3 . in the following",
    "we discuss the nature of the sources .",
    "the pa@xmath0 emission in s1 and s2 is coincident with the continuum emission . in the new images it is clear that the pa@xmath0 emission in the region of s1 and s2 has at least three components , s1 , s2 and diffuse , therefore , the extinction of a@xmath19 = 12.1 derived from the comparison of pa@xmath0 and br@xmath0 flux ratios in tskev is an average extinction .",
    "the extinction curves of @xcite were used to compute the extinction .",
    "the extinction for any of the individual components may be different than the average . if , however , the extinction is primarily foreground then the extinction effects all sources equally and the derivation is valid .",
    "we note that the 1.6   to 2.05  color is similar for s1 and s2 indicating that they may have the same extinction .",
    "the color of the diffuse continuum emission is blue rather than red , however , which supports the idea of less extinction in the regions of diffuse emission .    to get an estimate of the spatial distribution of the extinction we produced a h@xmath0 image from the archive acs hst images of sbs0335 - 052 from proposal 10575 ( pi g. stlin ) by subtracting the f550 m image from the fr675n ramp filter image .",
    "the f550 m image was multiplied by a factor of 0.2 to account for the differences in throughput .",
    "the factor was determined by the requirement that the sources with no pa@xmath0 emission , and therefore presumed to have no h@xmath0 emission , subtract to zero .",
    "this does not guarantee an accurate subtraction in the sources with hydrogen line emission since they are generally redder than the non - emission line sources .",
    "the h@xmath0 image was then resampled to the spatial resolution of the nicmos pa@xmath0 image . the ratio of the two images is an indicator of the relative extinction and is scaled to unity at the location of s1 .",
    "the differences in wavelength which changes the diameter of the airy rings limits the accuracy of this procedure .",
    "the extinctions of s1 and s2 are equal within the signal to noise of the image .",
    "the extinction of the extended sources s3-pa@xmath0 , s7 and s8 are also equal to s1 and s2 within the rather low signal to noise .",
    "the extinction in the diffuse region is 1/2 of that of s1 and s2 in terms of absolute flux .",
    "we therefore decrease the extinction in the diffuse flux by a factor of two in computing the properties of the diffuse emission .",
    "the extinction map shows significant structure due to the differences in spatial resolution and we estimate the accuracy of the relative extinctions derived from the map to be @xmath20 .",
    "the volume emission measure ( @xmath21 ) for s1 of @xmath22 @xmath23 is almost exactly the same as the previous measurement in tskev of @xmath24 , therefore the primary conclusions on the nature of s1 remain valid .",
    "note that throughout the discussion of the pa@xmath0 sources the ionized gas temperature is assumed to be 20,000k as discussed in tskev .",
    "s1 has a stellar mass of @xmath25 m@xmath3 , see ",
    "[ s - mass ] , with stars of less than 1 m@xmath3 probably not yet on the main sequence .",
    "there are 8650 stars earlier than o9 and the luminosity of the stellar population is @xmath26 l@xmath3 based on the output of starburst99 @xcite if we only account for the pa@xmath0 flux in the point - like object",
    ". a further discussion of the starburst99 calculation is given in ",
    "[ s - age ] .",
    "the star formation rate is 1.2 m@xmath3 per year based on a recombination case b recombination rate for 20,000k @xcite and the sfr to q(h@xmath27 ) ratio given by @xcite .",
    "the specific star formation rate , star formation rate divided by the mass of the s1 , of @xmath28 yr@xmath29 is relatively high .",
    "the specific star formation rate for the entire galaxy of @xmath30 yr@xmath29 , however , is quite low .",
    "we now resolve s2 from s1 and obtain a volume emission measure of @xmath31 @xmath23 for s2 , somewhat less than the arbitrary half of the total s1 plus s2 emission measure that was assigned to s2 in tskev .",
    "the parameters discussed above for s1 simply scale for s2 by the ratio of the volume emission measures .",
    "the difference between the values of the emission measure for s1 plus s2 in this work versus tskev is due to the separation of the sources from the diffuse background , some of which was included in the aperture measurement of pa@xmath0 in the previous work . unlike s1 , s2 is clearly not a point like object .",
    "it is irregular in shape and extended in the east - west direction .",
    "its average spatial extent is @xmath32 larger than s1 which puts its radius at 30 pc averaged over the east - west and north - south directions .",
    "the diffuse emission is the pa@xmath0 emission that remains after all of the emission associated with the sources s1-s8 is subtracted .",
    "the associated diffuse continuum emission is defined in the same way .",
    "the majority of the diffuse emission , defined in this manner , is in the region around s1 and s2 . in the commonly used radio emission measure the volume emission measure of @xmath33 @xmath23 is equivalent to that of @xmath34 o7 stars .",
    "the volume emission measure of the diffuse emission is more than 1/3 of the emission measures of s1 and s2 .",
    "this implies that the current star formation is roughly equally spread between diffuse and compact regions .",
    "we consider two possible interpretations of the diffuse pa@xmath0 emission .",
    "the first is ionizing radiation from s1 and s2 that escapes the clusters and ionizes the surrounding gas .",
    "the second is an underlying population of young stars .",
    "the volume emission measure of the diffuse gas is @xmath35 of the volume emission measure of s1 and s2 .",
    "the diffuse emission therefore requires some source of ionizing flux at the level of @xmath35 of that produced by s1 and s2 .",
    "this assumes that all of the ionizing photons from the source of ionizing flux for the diffuse emission are absorbed by the diffuse gas and none escape from the region .",
    "if the source of ionizing photons is photons that escape s1 and s2 but are trapped by the diffuse gas the mass and luminosity of the two sources must increase by a similar percentage .",
    "this would place the mass of s1 and s2 at @xmath36 m@xmath3 and @xmath37 m@xmath3 respectively .",
    "the luminosities for s1 and s2 become @xmath38 l@xmath3 and @xmath39 l@xmath3 . these are still reasonable parameters for the 2 sscs but they lie at the high side of known clusters , eg .",
    "@xcite . a difficulty may be that this makes the percentage of dust re - emitted luminosity of @xmath40 l@xmath3 @xcite , only @xmath20 of the total luminosity of s1 and s2 .",
    "the discussion of the h@xmath1 emission in   [ s - h2 ] , however , shows that this is a reasonable number .",
    "another difficulty could arise if the assumption that all of the ionizing flux produces observable pa@xmath0 emission is false .",
    "if a large fraction of the ionizing flux escapes the region then the mass and luminosity requirement can become unrealistic .",
    "also if the diffuse emission is simply ionized gas with no stellar continuum its pa@xmath0 equivalent width should be higher than that of s1 and s2 , instead it is lower .",
    "the equivalent width calculations described in   [ s - age ] in fact show that the diffuse emission has the lowest equivalent width of any pa@xmath0 source .",
    "this is very strong evidence against the concept that the diffuse pa@xmath0 is due to uv leakage from the clusters .",
    "the discussion in   [ s - age ] also indicates that the diffuse emission stellar population is most likely older than the other pa@xmath0 sources .",
    "the possibility that the diffuse ionization region is produced by an in - situ diffuse distribution of stars is a more plausible explanation .",
    "accounting for the diffuse emission with in - situ stars requires a stellar mass of @xmath35 of the combined masses of s1 and s2 if the stars are at the same epoch of evolution as the two sscs .",
    "the net star formation rate of the diffuse component in this explanation is 0.85 m@xmath3 yr@xmath29 .",
    "if this is the correct explanation for the diffuse emission then star formation in sbs0335 - 052 is occurring in a bi - modal fashion .",
    "the majority of the stellar mass is in the form of compact objects , s1-s6 , but the current star formation is roughly divided 2 to 1 between the compact and diffuse regions whereas current star formation in the milky way appears to be predominantly in diffuse regions .",
    "s3-pa@xmath0 is a source with a pa@xmath0 equivalent width very close to those of s1 and s2 . to delineate the pa@xmath0 emitting region from the continuum source s3 we have designated the emission region s3-pa@xmath0 .",
    "the separation of s3-pa@xmath0 is the reason that @xcite found an offset between the continuum and the line emission near s3 . as with the diffuse emission",
    "the question is whether this is a separate star forming source or is it gas that is ionized by the double source s3 or possibly the more distant sources s1 and s2 .",
    "s3-pa@xmath0 has a volume emission measure of @xmath41 @xmath23 which is equal to that of @xmath42 o7 stars . if this volume emission measure is due to sources other than in - situ stars it would have to be due to intercepted ionizing flux from one of the other sources .",
    "the lack of detectable pa@xmath0 flux at the location of s3 argues against it as the source of the ionizing flux .",
    "the only possibility would be if the the region around and in s3 is largely free of gas .",
    "the observed pa@xmath0 region subtends 2.2 steradians as seen from the location of s3 if its radial dimension is the same as its extent on the sky and therefore receives approximately @xmath43 of the emitted flux from s3 if it is emitted isotropically .",
    "note that as in the discussion of the diffuse emission we assume that the source of uv flux , the stars , emit radiation isotropically .",
    "sources can be `` beamed '' by large scale distributions of dust but dust structures simply block ionizing flux , they do not enhance the flux along any particular line of sight .",
    "the volume emission measure for s3 would then have to be @xmath44 @xmath23 , almost as high as s1 .",
    "the requirements for ionization by s1 and s2 are even more formidable .",
    "@xmath45 steradians as seen from s1 .",
    "the ionizing flux from s1 and s2 would then have to be 370 times larger than listed in table  [ tbl - ne2v ] , increasing their stellar mass to almost @xmath46 m@xmath3 .",
    "this is clearly not possible .",
    "the most likely source of ionization of s3-pa@xmath0 is in - situ young stars .",
    "this is the explanation that requires the minimum amount of ionizing flux as is the case for the diffuse flux discussed earlier .",
    "the star formation in this source is then in a more extended region than in the sscs , again showing the bi - modal nature of high pressure , low metallicity star formation .",
    "another argument in favor of local star formation in s3-pa@xmath0 is that the equivalent width of the pa@xmath0 flux is almost exactly the same as in s1 and s2 .",
    "this argues that s3-pa@xmath0 is the location of early star formation such as in s1 and s2 while the diffuse emission around s1 and s2 , which has a lower equivalent width , is due to an older stage of star formation as is further discussed in   [ s - age ] .",
    "two of the pa@xmath0 emitting sources are distinguished by significantly larger equivalent widths than the rest of the sources .",
    "they are s7 , the previously known source that was marked with a question mark in tskev and s8 , @xmath47 ( 664 pc ) from s1 as shown in figure  [ fig - map ] .",
    "note that both s7 and s8 are clearly visible in the images presented by @xcite , eg .",
    "their figure 3 , but were not commented on in the paper . both of these sources are extended and far away from any other known ionizing sources , particularly for s8 .",
    "it appears clear that these must be sites of new star formation and the ionization is due to in - situ stars .",
    "their volume emission measures , as shown in table  [ tbl - ne2v ] , are about a factor of 10 less than s1 and s2 and the total mass of stars is less .",
    "the star formation rates are 0.14 and 0.043 m@xmath3 yr@xmath29 respectively . the extinction map discussed in   [ ss - s1s2 ]",
    "gives the same average extinction in s7 and s8 as for s1 and s2 , but , the low signal to noise of the continuum make variations by a factor of 2 quite possible .",
    "the sources s3 , s4 , s5 and s6 are distinguished by the absence of any associated pa@xmath0 emission indicating a lack of ionized gas and current star formation in these sources .",
    "their continuum 1.6 to 2.05  colors are bluer than s1 and s2 which is most likely a function of the foreground extinction rather than their intrinsic color .",
    "source s3 deserves special mention as it may be the most enigmatic of all of the non - pa@xmath0 sources . in the acs uv",
    "f140lp image in figure  [ fig - pa ] s3 is clearly double , also seen in figure 1 right of tskev , with a spacing of @xmath48 ( 23 pc ) in the northeast - southwest direction on the sky .",
    "the infrared continuum is centered on the northeast component with no indication of a southwest source or extension .",
    "the continuum fluxes for s3 are also hard to explain . at uv wavelengths the two components of s3",
    "are roughly equal in brightness ( figure  [ fig - pa ] acs uv f140lp ) while at infrared wavelengths ( figure  [ fig - pa ] 1.6  continuum ) only the northeast component is seen but it is quite bright .",
    "a possibility is that the northeast component has an intrinsic brightness much brighter than the southwest but is much more heavily obscured so that at uv wavelengths they appear to be a roughly the same brightness .",
    "this explanation is possible but appears to be a bit contrived .",
    "the obscuring dust would have to be a significant distance in front of the northeast component of s3 otherwise we should see mid and far infrared emission from that location . on the other hand , it must be small enough to only obscure the northeast source .",
    "the discussion in   [ s - age ] indicates that the non - pa@xmath0 sources are older than the other sources which is consistent with triggered star formation starting in the north and propagating southward .",
    "only s3 is inconsistent with this progression since it is very near the young star forming region s3-pa@xmath0 .",
    "s5 is somewhat unique in that it is extremely compact as discussed in ",
    "[ s - size ] .",
    "s5 could possibly be a young globular cluster that has undergone core collapse .",
    "all of the non - pa@xmath0 sources have probably had most of the residual gas swept out of them and are bound young globular clusters .",
    "table  [ tbl - flux ] gives equivalent widths for the pa@xmath0 emission sources .",
    "the equivalent width is relative to the continuum measured in the f187n narrow line filter which is adjacent in wavelength to the f190n filter that measures the pa@xmath0 flux .",
    "use of the f160w or f205w filter images would give higher signal to noise but the uncertainty in the detailed spectrum and the inclusion of other emission lines in the broad filter compromises the accuracy of the equivalent width . in an attempt to determine the ages of the emission line sources we ran a starburst99 @xcite simulation with a stellar mass range of 0.1 - 120 m@xmath3 , a standard kroupa imf , a metallicity of 0.001 , time steps of @xmath49 years and an instantaneous burst of star formation .",
    "the luminosity of the pa@xmath0 line was calculated from the output pa@xmath50 luminosity using case b recombination and a temperature of 20,000k . from this line luminosity and the computed continuum flux at the wavelength of pa@xmath0",
    "the equivalent width of pa@xmath0 was calculated and plotted versus age in figure  [ fig - eqw ] .",
    "note that the continuum includes both stellar and nebular emission .",
    "the plot is marked with asterisks at the equivalent width appropriate for each source .",
    "the position marked for s8 is at the oldest consistent time .",
    "this equivalent width is achieved at two earlier times but the time spent at those values is very brief , @xmath49 and @xmath51 years , as opposed to @xmath52 years at the marked position .",
    "the dip in equivalent width around @xmath53 years is due to a rise in the infrared continuum rather than a dip in the pa@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "the parameters of the starburst99 simulation have little effect on the age sequence and ages of the sources for an instantaneous starburst .",
    "it is only the lifetimes of the high mass stars that affect the evolution of the ionizing flux .",
    "higher metallicities would decrease the ionizing flux per unit mass and different imfs would change the total mass needed to achieve the observed ionizing fluxes but not the time evolution . to check this assumption we produced another starburst99 simulation with a salpeter rather than kroupa imf .",
    "the resultant equivalent to figure  [ fig - eqw ] was indistinguishable from figure  [ fig - eqw ] .",
    "these changes only affect the mass estimate discussed in   [ s - mass ] .",
    "if , however , the star formation in each of the clusters is not short relative to the present age of the cluster the ages could be quite different from those derived here .",
    "the ages from figure  [ fig - eqw ] are only valid if the star formation epoch is short relative to the age of the clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig - eqw ] indicates that s7 and s8 are young star forming regions with ages less than 10 million years with s7 , the youngest , at about 4 million years .",
    "s1 , s2 and s3-pa@xmath0 all formed at roughly the same epoch and are now about 10 million years old . the diffuse emission is from an older group of stars formed a million years before the s1 , s2 , s3-pa@xmath0 group .",
    "the sources without detectable pa@xmath0 emission are at least 15 million years old or older .",
    "this shows a general progression in age of the sscs with oldest sources in the north and the youngest in the south , evidence for triggered star formation running from north to south .",
    "new star formation is now occurring in s7 and the more distant s8 .",
    "a 1 km / sec wind would propagate 10 pc in 10 million years which makes it doubtful that s8 , which is 340 pc from s1 and s2 , is causally affected by the sscs .",
    "the starburst99 output provides an estimate of the stellar mass for those objects with pa@xmath0 emission . the starburst99 calculation used a stellar mass of @xmath54",
    ", therefore , the ratio of the observed pa@xmath0 power versus the calculated pa@xmath0 power times @xmath54 at the age given in figure  [ fig - eqw ] gives the mass .",
    "the masses are given in the last column of table  [ tbl - ne2v ] .",
    "as discussed in   [ s - age ] the masses are sensitive to the parameters used in the starburst99 model , particularly on the imf and metallicity used .",
    "the metallicity is appropriate for that measured in the clusters but we do not have sufficient information to accurately determine the actual imf and many of the low mass stars are still probably in their pre - main sequence evolutionary stages .",
    "the largest mass components are the two compact sources s1 and s2 plus the diffuse component which total to a mass of @xmath55 .",
    "if the sscs with no pa@xmath0 are included with an average mass of @xmath56 per ssc then the total mass is on the order of @xmath57 .",
    "taking the total gas mass as @xmath58 @xcite then the ratio of total stellar mass in the nucleus of sbs0335 - 052e to the gas mass of 1 to 26 is significantly higher than the average nuclear cluster mass to gas ratio found by @xcite .",
    "the average nuclear cluster mass to gas ratio in @xcite , however , is dominated by nuclear clusters in large spiral galaxies rather than in bcd low metallicity galaxies . the objects",
    "s3-pa@xmath0 , s7 and s8 , which have less concentrated star formation have significantly less mass , with s7 having only @xmath59",
    ". this may represent star formation in what we would term open clusters and they may not remain bound for very long .",
    "a new finding of this investigation is the precise location of the h@xmath1 emission in s1 and s2 .",
    "previous ground based observations by @xcite did not have the spatial resolution to resolve the sources .",
    "the contour map in figure  [ fig - h2 ] shows separate emission regions in both s1 and s2 .",
    "the emission region in s1 is consistent with being point - like while the emission in s2 is extended as is the continuum emission .",
    "both of the regions are offset from the center of the continuum emission .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission region in s1 is offset by @xmath60 ( 11.6 pc ) to the east from the continuum center and the h@xmath1 region in s2 is offset by the same amount to the south .",
    "these offsets are less than the radii of the clusters so that the molecular emission regions exist inside the region of pa@xmath0 emission .",
    "there is no chance that the offsets are due to misalignment of the images as the new h@xmath1 and pa@xmath0 images were taken in the same orbit for each dither position with no change is hst attitude .",
    "taken alone these images clearly show the offset .",
    "the additional archival pa@xmath0 images were then registered to the new pa@xmath0 images and the same offset was present .",
    "it is remotely possible that the two h@xmath1 regions are located along the line of sight to s1 and s2 but outside of the clusters .",
    "this might be considered a possibility if only one ssc coincided with a h@xmath1 source but it is highly unlikely that two sscs lie along the line of sight to the only two h@xmath1 sources .",
    "the survival of molecular gas inside the sources is another line of evidence that the photo - ionizing flux does not reach throughout the clusters .",
    "the molecular regions are also the most likely sources of the observed mid - infrared emission found by @xcite and further discussed by @xcite . if these are the emission regions and they are small dust regions embedded in the cluster then they are not capable of absorbing all of the luminosity of the cluster and re - emitting it in the infrared .",
    "this accounts for the low ir luminosity to total luminosity ratio discussed in   [ ss - ds1ds2 ] .",
    "their location inside the cluster also probably accounts for the high temperature of the observed dust emission .",
    "the calculation of the mass of h@xmath1 needed to produce the observed emission depends on the temperature of the h@xmath1 gas and the ratio of thermal to fluorescent emission , neither of which is accurately available .",
    "@xcite find that the emission is a mixture of fluorescent and thermal emission which makes the line ratios an unreliable monitor of the thermal temperature . to get a rough estimate of the amount of h@xmath1 needed to produce the observed ( 1 - 0 ) s(1 ) emission we calculate the h@xmath1 abundance needed for a 2500 k thermal gas using an einstein a value of @xmath61 s@xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this estimate should be good to about a factor of two to three , modulo the amount of extinction , if the contributions from thermal and fluorescent emission are about equal .",
    "table  [ tbl - ne2v ] gives the mass of h@xmath1 needed to produce the observed line strength under the assumption of the same extinction as used in the pa@xmath0 calculation .",
    "this is a lower limit on the h@xmath1 since the extinction will be significantly higher in the dust protected molecular region .",
    "@xcite calculate a 9.7   extinction of 0.49 magnitudes which predicts about 2.6 magnitudes of extinction at 2.12  as opposed to the 1.4 magnitudes derived from the atomic hydrogen lines .",
    "@xcite spectroscopically observed a line strength that is about 2.2 times larger than that quoted in the table .",
    "we may have missed some of the extended flux but the value here is within 1.9@xmath62 of the spectroscopic value .",
    "the primary conclusions on the nature of the sscs s1 and s2 in tskev remain intact .",
    "although the possibility exists that the diffuse emission around s1 and s2 is due to ionizing radiation from them , the more likely explanation is that the ionization is done by in - situ stars .",
    "the lower equivalent width of the diffuse radiation is strong evidence for this view .",
    "if the diffuse emission was due to pure ionized gas with no stars its equivalent width should be higher rather than lower than the equivalent width of the star rich clusters s1 and s2 .",
    "this leaves the conclusion that s1 and s2 are currently not producing any negative feedback from photo - ionizing flux on star formation in sbs0335 - 052e intact .",
    "the delay in photo - ionizing feedback may also have implications for planet formation .",
    "the ambient uv radiation field may be significantly less than the fields calculated without considering absorption by stellar winds , eg .",
    "this would increase the probability of planet formation even in the environment of a ssc which would normally be considered not conducive to planet formation .",
    "it also has implications on whether globular clusters are good sites for future searches for planets .",
    "the deeper and higher spatial resolution images have revealed that there are star formation regions in sbs0335 - 052e that are not compact sscs .",
    "two of these regions , s7 and s8 , appear to be younger than s1 and s2 while the other extended region , s3-pa@xmath0 appears to be roughly coeval with s1 and s2 .",
    "the appearance of these extended regions of star formation may mark the end of the formation of compact stellar clusters and perhaps the beginning of negative photo - ionizing feedback . because the volume emission measures of the extended sources are significantly lower than that of s1 and s2 , modulo extinction , they do not contribute much to the net radio emission .",
    "if the extended regions have extended hii regions then they should be optically thin .",
    "future observations with the evla should be capable of taking spatially resolved radio images of the different sources to determine whether they are optically thick or thin at radio frequencies .    @xcite discuss the effect of pressure on the ratio of compact to diffuse star formation .",
    "they claim that high pressure favors the formation of compact clusters as opposed to diffuse star formation .",
    "@xcite has simulated the merger of two dwarf galaxies with stellar masses @xmath63 and gas masses of @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 of the new stars in this simulation appear in compact clusters , far more than in simulations at lower pressures .",
    "sbs0335 - 052 has a gas mass of @xmath66 and a gas to stellar mass ratio of 25 - 26 ( pustilnik et al . 2001 ; this work ) therefore the central gas pressure should be significantly higher than the model considered by @xcite leading to an increased fraction of star formation in clusters .",
    "one day after the initial submission of this manuscript , new work on sbs0335 - 052e became publicly available @xcite , hereinafter rjh , which reaches some different conclusions than this work .",
    "rjh derive significantly lower masses and ionizing fluxes than this work , particularly for the youngest sources , s1 and s2 , where the difference is a factor of 15 and 10 respectively .",
    "the main diagnostic tool of rjh is sed fitting to the optically observed hst acs images of @xcite .",
    "this fitting , confined to the first 4 acs bands leads to significantly lower dust extinction values than are derived in this work and tskev .",
    "our a@xmath19 value is 12.1 as opposed to 0.5 in rjh .",
    "this is the primary reason for the different conclusions drawn between the two works .",
    "source fluxes redder than the f550 m band deviate strongly from the rjh derived sed and must be explained by a combination of hot dust and extended red emission @xcite .",
    "the extinction model needed to account for the observed hydrogen emission line ratios is gray from h@xmath50 to br@xmath67 with 0.9 magnitudes of extinction for each line .",
    "our model with an a@xmath19 value of 12.1 and an extinction law given by @xcite implies significantly more line flux which requires a larger @xmath21 and more mass in stars to provide the ionizing flux . this model does not require the extra emission components to match the observed fluxes",
    "new high spatial resolution nicmos camera 2 images of the region of sbs0335 - 052e that contains a compact group of sscs have improved our detailed knowledge of the geometry and physics of the system .",
    "there are 6 point - like objects , 7 if the binary nature of s3 is taken into account , that are either currently sscs ( s1 and s2 ) or were most likely previously sscs ( s3-s6 ) .",
    "we now know that the continuum source s3 is not at the same position as the pa@xmath0 source s3-pa@xmath0 .",
    "in addition to the compact sources there are 4 diffuse or extended regions of pa@xmath0 emission , indicating current star formation in non compact objects . it should be noted , however , that a diffuse distribution of many compact sources with stellar masses on the order of @xmath68 m@xmath3 would be difficult to differentiate from a diffuse distribution of individual stars .",
    "two of these regions , s7 and s8 appear to be significantly younger than the two star forming sscs .",
    "one of the star forming regions , s8 , is well separated from the compact group of previously known sources .",
    "these regions are the first indication of significant star forming activity in sbs0335 - 052e in anything other than very compact clusters .",
    "they are significantly less massive than the very compact clusters , modulo extinction , and may be open clusters that will not remain bound after the gas is expelled . the new images still support the general picture of delayed photo - ionizing negative feedback from the sources s1 and s2 along with the general picture of propagating star formation from the north to the south .",
    "this delay in feedback may also affect the number of planetary systems that can form in what would normally be considered a very harsh environment .",
    "we have also confirmed that the h@xmath1 emission is inside both s1 and s2 but is not at the exact center of the two objects and probably marks the location of the regions producing the observed mid - infrared emission .",
    "one result that differed from tskev is the size of s1 where the possibility was raised that sscs may be the origin of intermediate mass black holes through the merging of stellar mass black holes created by supernova events in the cluster .",
    "the new radius of 15 pc is approximately 3 times larger than the previous radius and would affect the possibility of forming intermediate mass black holes .",
    "equation 1 of @xcite indicates that the time scale for forming merged intermediate mass black holes is dependent on radius to the 3/2 power .",
    "the new radius of s1 would therefore increase the time scale by about a factor of 5 .",
    "even at the new radius , however , sscs seem to be a leading candidate for the formation site of greater than stellar mass black holes .",
    "see also the very recent discussion of massive black hole formation in early low metallicity star clusters by @xcite .",
    "we wish to acknowledge very helpful discussions with kelsey johnson and to thank an anonymous referee for comments that have improved this manuscript .",
