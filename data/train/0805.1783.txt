    "magnetic helicity is a physical quantity that measures the topological complexity of a magnetic field , such as the degree of linkage and/or twistedness in the field ( moffatt 1985 , berger & field 1984 ) . in a previous paper ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter referred to as zfl ) we proposed that in an open atmosphere such as the solar corona there is an upper bound on the total magnetic helicity that a force - free field can contain .",
    "the accumulation of magnetic helicity in excess of this upper bound would initiate a non - equilibrium situation , resulting in a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) as a natural product of coronal evolution .",
    "our approach ( zhang & low 2003 , 2005 , zfl ) shifts the traditional focus on the mechanism for cme evolution from the storage of magnetic energy to the accumulation of magnetic helicity , although the two types of considerations are not necessarily exclusive with each other .",
    "the advantage of using magnetic helicity as a more fundamental physical quantity is that from observations we know that the magnetic fields are emerging from the solar interior with a preferred helicity sign in each solar hemisphere ( pevtsov et al .",
    "1995 , rust & kumar 1996 , bao & zhang 1998 , zhang 2006 ) . as a result ,",
    "an accumulation of the total magnetic helicity in the corona becomes unavoidable because the total magnetic helicity is approximately conserved in the corona during coronal processes including fast magnetic reconnection ( berger 1984 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we study how the magnitude of the upper bound of the total magnetic helicity depends on the boundary condition .",
    "section 2 presents the model with two new boundary conditions .",
    "results and analysis are presented in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "a brief summary of the paper is given .",
    "following flyer et al . ( 2004 ) and zfl , we use the families of power - law axisymmetric force - free fields to understand the basic physical properties of interest .    with axisymmetry ,",
    "the solenoidal magnetic field @xmath0 in @xmath1 can be written in the form of @xmath2 ~,\\ ] ] where the flux function @xmath3 defines the poloidal magnetic field and the function @xmath4 defines the toroidal ( or azimuthal ) field .",
    "@xmath4 is defined as a strict power - law in @xmath3 with the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an odd constant index required to be no less than 5 in order for the field to possess finite magnetic energy in @xmath1 and @xmath7 is a free parameter which we choose to be positive without loss of generality .",
    "this form of @xmath4 reduces the force - free condition to the following governing equation for the flux function @xmath3 : @xmath8    this governing equation was solved numerically as a boundary value problem within domain @xmath1 in flyer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and zfl , subject to the prescribed boundary flux distribution of @xmath9 this boundary flux distribution and its associated normal field distribution are plotted in the top panels of figure 1 .",
    "all force - free fields discussed in flyer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and zfl share the boundary flux distribution given by ( [ dipolar ] ) , which is the same as that for a dipole potential field corresponding to the solution of equation ( [ eqna ] ) with @xmath10 . the solutions of ( [ eqna ] ) with boundary condition ( [ dipolar ] ) shall be referred to as dipolar force - free fields or dipolar fields for short .",
    "we refer interested readers to flyer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and zfl for various properties of dipolar force - free fields for the cases of @xmath11 .      in this paper ,",
    "we solve the same governing equation ( [ eqna ] ) using the numerical methods described in flyer et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 but subject to two new and distinctively different boundary conditions .",
    "we use these numerical solutions to investigate how properties we discussed in zfl would change with the new boundary conditions .",
    "the first new boundary condition has the flux distribution of @xmath12 this flux distribution and its associated normal field distribution are plotted in the middle panels of figure 1 .",
    "we see that this new boundary condition has its flux concentrated nearer to the equator than that of the dipolar field .",
    "this makes it more like solar active regions with its normal field strength much higher at equatorial regions than that near the poles .",
    "we shall refer this family of power - law axisymmetric force - free fields as bipolar force - free fields or bipolar fields hereafter .",
    "the second new family of solutions are those that we shall refer to as multipolar force - free fields or multipolar fields .",
    "they are also the solutions to ( [ eqna ] ) but subject to the following boundary condition : @xmath13 its flux distribution and associated normal field distribution are plotted in the bottom panels of figure 1 .",
    "we see that fields with this boundary condition have both positive and negative magnetic fields in one hemisphere , distinctively different from those in dipolar force - free fields and bipolar force - free fields where fields in one hemisphere have the same magnetic polarity .",
    "table 1 presents a comparison of the three boundary conditions .",
    "we see that their common feature is that they all have @xmath14 at solar poles and @xmath15 at the equator .",
    "the dipolar boundary and bipolar boundary differ by the contrast of their respective maximum @xmath16 values to their @xmath16 values at the northern pole .",
    "the multipolar boundary condition differs from the dipolar and bipolar boundary conditions by the existence of both magnetic polarities in each hemisphere , indicated by its negative minimum @xmath3 value .    in table 1",
    "we also present the total surface poloidal flux ( @xmath17 ) for the three boundary conditions , where @xmath18 we see that dipolar and bipolar fields have the same total surface poloidal flux ( @xmath19 ) and the multipolar fields have a larger total surface poloidal flux ( @xmath20 ) . in the latter development of the paper , we will normalize calculated magnetic helicity by @xmath21 in order to make fields with different boundary conditions comparable .",
    "as in zfl , for each new boundary condition , we numerically solve ( [ eqna ] ) for three cases : @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in each case , the numerical method , that is , the newton s iteration combined with a pseudo - arc length continuation scheme , guarantees the completeness of each solution branch generated by the @xmath7 values .",
    "also as in zfl , for each obtained solution , we calculate three physical quantities of the field .",
    "they are : total magnetic energy @xmath25 total azimuthal flux @xmath26 and total relative magnetic helicity @xmath27 the derivation of these formula can be found in zfl .",
    "the only difference is that since we are also considering multipolar fields the absolute value of @xmath28 ( that is , @xmath29 ) is introduced when calculating total azimuthal flux .    in the geometric simplicity of these force - free fields ,",
    "the equilibrium in each case is due to the magnetic tension force of the poloidal flux confining the magnetic pressure of the azimuthal flux .",
    "the magnitude of the tension force is sensitively related to the poloidal flux at the inner boundary ( @xmath30 ) that serves as an anchor agent .",
    "moreover , the poloidal flux and its tension force become weaker in the outward radial direction . hence ,",
    "if the azimuthal flux becomes too large it can not be confined by such a mechanism as was shown in zfl for dipolar fields .",
    "the magnetic pressure is independent of the sign of the field .",
    "therefore , the total unsigned azimuthal flux given by ( [ fphi ] ) is more relevant for the consideration of flux confinement than the total signed azimuthal flux .",
    "figure 2 presents the variations of the total magnetic energy ( @xmath31 ) , total azimuthal flux ( @xmath32 ) and total magnetic helicity ( @xmath33 ) versus @xmath7 along the solution curve for bipolar force - free fields with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the figure is similar to the figure 2 of zfl except that figure 2 in zfl is for dipolar force - free fields .",
    "each point along the solution curve , denoted by a plus symbol in the figure , represents a solution to ( [ eqna ] ) . by solution curve",
    "we mean that all solutions along the curve are obtained with the same boundary condition and the same constant index @xmath6 but with a monotonically increasing magnitude of total azimuthal flux .    from these curves of solutions",
    "we see that there may be upper bounds on the total magnetic energy , total azimuthal flux as well as total magnetic helicity for bipolar fields , as that we have suggested in zfl for dipolar fields .",
    "from figure 2 we can also see that the magnitude of the helicity upper bound for bipolar fields is smaller than that for dipolar fields .",
    "while the upper bound for dipolar fields is close to 14 , the upper bound for bipolar fields only approaches 9 . to illustrate this further",
    ", we plot in figure 3 the variation of the total magnetic helicity ( @xmath33 ) versus azimuthal flux ( @xmath32 ) along the solution curve for fields with the dipolar ( top panels ) and bipolar ( bottom panels ) boundary conditions .",
    "here we have normalized the values of total magnetic helicity ( @xmath33 ) of each field by the square of their corresponding surface poloidal fluxes ( @xmath21 ) as those in demoulin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , van driel - gesztelyi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and demoulin ( 2007 ) .",
    "we see that while the upper bound of @xmath34 is about 0.35 for dipolar fields , for bipolar fields it is significantly lower at 0.22 .",
    "this result suggests a dependence of the helicity upper bound on the boundary condition , which in our view gives an insight into observed associations between cmes and magnetic features at their solar surface origins .",
    "observationally we know that cmes can be triggered by flux emergence ( e.g. feynman & martin 1995 , subramanian & dere 2001 ) and converging motions ( e.g. martin 1990 ) .",
    "different theoretical models have also proposed that cme - type eruptions can be triggered by various surface field variations ( e.g. chen & shibata 2000 , amari et al .",
    "2000 , 2003a , 2003b ) .",
    "we suggest that the common physics underlying the different mechanisms associated with such surface field variations is the dependence of helicity upper bound on the boundary condition . when a magnetic field has accumulated a certain amount of magnetic helicity ( but not yet enough for an eruption )",
    "then a change of the boundary condition could lower the helicity upper bound , resulting in a non - equilibrium situation and hence a cme eruption under the new boundary condition .",
    "for example , if @xmath34 were 0.3 for a dipolar boundary condition , then an evolutionary change to a bipolar boundary condition would result in a cme eruption because the applicable upper bound on the conserved total helicity has been reduced as suggested by our numerical experiments .",
    "a note to address here is that although in this paper we have emphasized the role of boundary condition variations this does not mean that the role of magnetic helicity accumulation becomes less important .",
    "a change of the boundary condition may bring in an eruption only when the field has accumulated enough helicity for an eruption under the new boundary condition .",
    "if not , the field does not erupt even when the boundary flux distribution is changing .",
    "this is consistent with the observation ( zhang et al .",
    "2007 ) that although flux emergences are indeed found to be associated with cme eruptions , the same rate of flux emergence can also be found when there is no cme or solar activities .",
    "this means that flux emergence may be a trigger of a cme eruption , but flux emergence alone do not guarantee an eruption .",
    "another interesting result from our calculations is that these normalized @xmath34 helicities , estimated from simple axisymmetric power - law force - free fields , lie close to those estimated from observations .",
    "van driel - gesztelyi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and demoulin ( 2007 ) pointed out that the @xmath34 numbers , estimated from the extrapolated magnetic fields based on observed photospheric magnetograms , are between 0.02 to 0.2 .",
    "our helicity upper bound numbers of dipolar and bipolar fields are just a little higher .",
    "notice that the numbers estimated from the observations may be somehow underestimated because of the limited spatial resolution of the observed magnetograms .",
    "so there seems to be consistency between the theoretical @xmath34 helicities and those estimated from observations .",
    "figure 4 presents four field configurations selected from the @xmath24 solution curve , positions of which along the curve are illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "we see that starting from the potential field ( panel a ) the curve first reaches the maximum-@xmath7 field ( panel b ) and then the field with maximum total magnetic energy ( panel c ) and then the one with maximum total azimuthal flux ( panel d ) . a clear bubble ( representing a flux rope )",
    "is presented in the field of panel c but not in the field of panel d where the latter actually possesses more total azimuthal flux than the former .",
    "this tells us that although the existence of a flux rope ( or flux ropes ) in the low corona does represent a storage of a certain amount of magnetic helicity ( see more discussions in zhang & low 2003 ) it is not necessary that they are present in the field with a maximum helicity storage .      as in figure 2 , we present in figure 5 the variations of the total magnetic energy , total azimuthal flux and total magnetic helicity versus @xmath7 along the solution curve with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 but for the multipolar fields .",
    "we see that these curves also suggest the existence of upper bounds on the total magnetic energy , total azimuthal flux as well as total magnetic helicity as those for dipolar fields and bipolar fields .",
    "the figure also shows that the magnitude of the helicity upper bound for multipolar fields is smaller than that for dipolar fields .",
    "this reduction is even more evident in figure 6 where we plot @xmath34 versus @xmath35 .",
    "we see that the upper bound of @xmath34 for multipolar fields is below 0.04 , almost ten times smaller than that of dipolar fields .",
    "such a severe reduction of @xmath34 upper bound not only further confirms our previous result that the helicity upper bound is dependent on the boundary condition , but also brings our theoretical @xmath34 value even closer to those estimated from observations ( regnier et al .",
    "furthermore , the severe reduction of the helicity upper bound in terms of @xmath34 values may also explain why solar eruptions such as cmes are more likely to happen in complicated active regions where the multipolar field , by the above property , will take less time to reach its helicity bound , producing an eruption .",
    "as in figure 4 , figure 7 presents four field configurations selected from the @xmath23 solution curve of the multipolar fields .",
    "we see again a clear bubble in the field of panel c but not in panel d. therefore , as with bipolar fields , multipolar fields with maximum helicity storage need not contain a flux rope .",
    "a rope of highly helical field is susceptible to an instability that causes the rope to kink ( friedberg 1987 ) . from elementary calculations",
    ", this kink instability sets in if a critical twist is exceeded ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the exact value of @xmath37 depends on the detailed field models , and could increase from the traditional kruskal - shafranov limit @xmath38 to @xmath39 ( hood & priest 1981 ) and @xmath40 ( mikic et al .",
    "1990 ) .    since we have helical flux tubes ( or flux ropes ) present in our solutions , it is interesting to investigate whether these flux ropes have exceeded the kink instability .",
    "figure 8 presents the variation of the average twist ( @xmath41 ) versus @xmath42 for two fields .",
    "one of the fields is the bipolar @xmath24 maximum - energy field , the one presented in panel c of figure 4 .",
    "the other is the multipolar @xmath23 maximum - energy field , the one presented in panel c of figure 7 . here",
    "@xmath42 is the angle from the equator .",
    "the average twist ( @xmath41 ) is obtained from @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the total relative magnetic helicity in domain @xmath45 , enclosed by the @xmath30 surface and the flux surface with @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the total surface ( @xmath30 ) polodial flux of the domain @xmath45 .",
    "we see that in both fields the average twist of the central part of the field ( that is , where the flux rope is located ) has exceeded the kink instability criteria , @xmath39 of hood & priest ( 1981 ) or @xmath40 of mikic et al .",
    "this tells us that with the accumulation of a certain amount of magnetic helicity , the flux rope formed in the field can possess a twist number that is larger than the kink instability criteria .",
    "if other necessary conditions are favorable , for example , if the field has accumulated enough free magnetic energy , an eruption may happen even before the field has reached its helicity upper bound state . in that sense , reaching the helicity upper bound state may not be a necessary condition for eruption , but the helicity upper bound is a sufficient condition upon which an eruption will become unavoidable .",
    "this also shows that cme eruptions that are initiated by the kink instability ( e.g. torok and kliem 2005 , fan & gibson 2007 ) or by the existence of helicity upper bound could both be viewed as the consequences of magnetic helicity accumulation and they are not mutually exclusive .",
    "in this paper , we continue our study on the hydromagnetic origin of cmes in terms of magnetic helicity accumulation . as in a previous paper ( zfl )",
    ", we numerically solve ( [ eqna ] ) to get families of axisymmetric power - law force - free fields , but subject to two new boundary conditions .      1 .",
    "the suggestion that there may be an upper bound on the total magnetic helicity for force - free fields is also found for the two new boundary conditions .",
    "the magnitude of the helicity upper bound of force - free fields is non - trivially dependent on the boundary condition . in our examples ,",
    "the fields with a surface flux distribution more like a simple active region ( bipolar fields ) have their helicity upper bound smaller than that of fields with dipolar boundary condition . for multipolar fields , the helicity upper bound ( @xmath34 ) can be ten times smaller than that of dipolar fields .",
    "these results provide some insights into the observed association of cmes with flux emergence and surface field variation .",
    "these results also suggest a physical reason why eruptions are more likely to happen in complicated active regions .",
    "cme initiations by kink instability and by the existence of a helicity upper bound can both be the result of magnetic helicity accumulation in the corona .",
