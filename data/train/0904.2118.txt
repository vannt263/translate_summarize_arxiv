    "<S> first principles calculations are used to investigate the effects of epitaxial strain on the structure of the perovskite oxide catio@xmath0 , with particular focus on the stabilization of a ferroelectric phase related to a polar instability hidden in the orthorhombic equilibrium bulk @xmath1 structure but found in previous first - principles studies of the ideal cubic perovskite high - symmetry reference structure . at 1.5% strain </S>",
    "<S> , we find an epitaxial orientation transition between the @xmath2-@xmath3 phase , favored for compressive strains , and the @xmath4-@xmath3 phase . for larger tensile strains , a polar instability develops in the @xmath4-@xmath3 phase and an epitaxial - strain - induced ferroelectric phase </S>",
    "<S> is obtained with polarization along a @xmath5110@xmath6 direction with respect to the primitive perovskite lattice vectors of the square substrate .    with the recent dramatic advances in the synthesis of coherent epitaxial films of complex oxides </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it is possible to maintain extremely high strains in thin film materials , often as much as 23% . in some materials , such high strains can drive the system through a structural phase boundary to a novel phase with structure and properties distinct from those of the bulk equilibrium phase . </S>",
    "<S> first principles calculations can provide quantitative predictions about these novel phases and phase boundaries ; in particular , such phases can be identified from examination of the lattice instabilities of the high - symmetry reference structure of the bulk phase @xcite , and their structure and properties predicted .    </S>",
    "<S> a prototypical example is strain - induced ferroelectricity in srtio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the bulk equilibrium paraelectric phase , strain - polarization coupling results in a polar instability beyond critical values of both tensile and compressive ( 001 ) epitaxial strain . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior was predicted by landau theory @xcite and further analyzed in first principles investigations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental observation of epitaxial - strain induced ferroelectricity in srtio@xmath0  @xcite demonstrates this strain - induced ferroelectricity both for compressive and tensile strain .    </S>",
    "<S> catio@xmath0 presents a greater challenge for the observation of strain - induced ferroelectricity . </S>",
    "<S> a relatively large temperature - dependent dielectric response has led to the characterization of catio@xmath0 , like srtio@xmath0 , as an incipient ferroelectric @xcite . however , unlike srtio@xmath0 , catio@xmath0 has a strong tendency to oxygen - octahedron rotations , which tend to suppress polar lattice instabilities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the bulk @xmath1 structure  @xcite , a structure type that includes a large number of other perovskite oxides , is obtained as a distortion of the high - symmetry cubic perovskite reference structure by freezing in components of the m@xmath7 and r@xmath8 oxygen octahedron modes ( notation from ref .  ) involving rotation around [ 001 ] and tilting around [ 110 ] , respectively , with additional changes in the lattice constants @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath4 and ca displacements preserving the space group symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> all other known phases are also nonpolar : these include a paraelectric cubic structure at high temperatures and two intermediate phases ( one tetragonal and one orthorhombic ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> less is known about high - pressure phases , though a transition to a nonpolar orthorhombic @xmath11 structure and , at higher pressures , to a nonpolar post - perovskite structure like that of mgsio@xmath0 have been proposed based on first - principles results @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> first - principles calculations of the full phonon dispersion relation of the cubic perovskite structure of catio@xmath0 show that in addition to the expected instability of m@xmath7 and r@xmath8 , the cubic perovskite structure does have a strongly unstable polar @xmath12 mode  @xcite . freezing in of this polar mode , which involves displacements of the ca and ti ions relative to the oxygen octahedron network , </S>",
    "<S> would yield a ferroelectric phase with nonzero spontaneous polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that it does not contribute to the observed bulk phases suggests that it is inhibited by the oxygen octahedron rotations . </S>",
    "<S> if the rotations are artificially suppressed , as is possible in a first - principles calculation , the @xmath12 mode dominates and the resulting ferroelectric @xmath13 phase is found to have a very large polarization  @xcite .    to stabilize a ferroelectric phase of catio@xmath0 under conditions realizable in the laboratory , it is necessary to change the balance of the competition between the octahedral rotations and the polar instability in favor of the latter . as in srtio@xmath0 , the polar instability in catio@xmath0 could be strengthened through the well - established sensitivity of the polar mode to strain in the titanates  @xcite , specifically by tuning epitaxial strain  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the oxygen - octahedron distortions inevitable in catio@xmath0 will couple to the epitaxial strain and polar instability , leading to a richer set of possibilities than in srtio@xmath0 .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study the use of epitaxial strain to stabilize a ferroelectric phase of catio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the orthorhombic bulk ground state , and investigate whether epitaxial strain can induce a polar instability , analogous to the behavior of srtio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively low symmetry of the @xmath1 structure requires careful attention in imposing the epitaxial constraints , and introduces new features into the strain - induced ferroelectric state .    </S>",
    "<S> we performed density functional theory total - energy calculations within the lda approximation using the vasp code  @xcite with its supplied paw potentials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the plane - wave energy cutoff was 680 ev and the k - point grid was @xmath14 .    for the study of the effects of epitaxial strain , we carried out  strained bulk \" calculations , in which total - energy calculations are performed for the periodic crystal with appropriate epitaxial constraints imposed on the lattice parameters . in some cases , these are constraints which can not be automatically imposed within the available vasp relaxation algorithms . in such cases </S>",
    "<S> , we developed an elastic energy expansion around the lowest energy @xmath1 structure that satisfies the epitaxial constraint by fitting to the energies of structures with small changes in strain ( the latter structures not necessarily satisfying the epitaxial constraints ) . </S>",
    "<S> this elastic energy is then minimized with respect to strain subject to the epitaxial strain constraint ; the resulting lattice parameters are then fixed in a total - energy calculation in which the internal structural parameters are relaxed . </S>",
    "<S> all structures were relaxed until the forces on the atoms were less than @xmath15 mev /  .    for selected structures , we compute the stability against zone - center modes by performing frozen phonon calculations in which single atoms are displaced by approximately @xmath16  . from finite differences of the resulting forces , </S>",
    "<S> the force constant matrices are determined and subsequently diagonalized to obtain eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors .    </S>",
    "<S> our results for the structure of the bulk orthorhombic ground state are given in table [ wyckoff ] . </S>",
    "<S> the structure has an energy 410 mev / f.u .  </S>",
    "<S> lower than the ideal cubic perovskite structure . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with previous first - principles calculations @xcite , we find good agreement between the computed structure and experiment , taking into account that in the local density approximation lattice constants typically tend to be underestimated by about one percent .    </S>",
    "<S> .[wyckoff ] the wyckoff parameters of the @xmath1 ground state and the @xmath4-@xmath3 structure at 3% tensile strain . [ cols=\">,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     next , we investigate the effects of epitaxial strain on the @xmath1 phase . as in ref . , we designate the strained phases as @xmath3 , where the prefix @xmath17 denotes `` epitaxial . '' </S>",
    "<S> we consider epitaxial strain on a square lattice substrate , corresponding to a ( 001 ) perovskite surface . to allow direct comparison with experiment despite the lattice constant </S>",
    "<S> underestimate discussed above , we define epitaxial strain relative to @xmath18 = 3.77  , which is the cube root of the computed volume per formula unit of the relaxed @xmath1 structure . in the @xmath1 structure , there are two symmetry - inequivalent primitive perovskite ( 001 ) planes , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ epbnm ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there are two distinct orientations for an epitaxial film : the first , with @xmath19 in the matching plane and @xmath20 and @xmath21 out of the plane ( @xmath2-@xmath3 , figure [ epbnm ] ( a ) ) , and the second , with @xmath19 normal to the matching plane ( @xmath4-@xmath3 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ epbnm](b ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we compute the total energies for these two orientations for epitaxial strains ranging from @xmath221.5% to 4% @xcite . for @xmath4-@xmath3 , the @xmath4 lattice parameter and internal structural parameters are relaxed at each strain , maintaining the @xmath1 symmetry ; the @xmath9 and @xmath10 lattice parameters are fixed by the constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the epitaxial constraint allows for @xmath19 not to be normal to the matching @xmath2-plane and tilting @xmath19 could lower the energy </S>",
    "<S> . however , an elastic analysis for the @xmath221.5% and 4% cases showed that tilting @xmath19 does not lower the energy and we assumed this to be true for the intermediate strains as well . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2-@xmath3 has lower symmetry than @xmath4-@xmath3 ; that is , distinguishing one of the two ( 110 ) planes removes space group symmetries , resulting in a space group @xmath23 ; the constraint fixes @xmath24 and @xmath25 , as well as the condition @xmath26 = 0 . to optimize the lattice parameters for this case </S>",
    "<S> , we use the elastic energy expansion method described in the previous section .    </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ totalenergy ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2-@xmath3 is favorable for compressive strains and @xmath4-@xmath3 is favored with increasing tensile strains . within this subspace of nonpolar structures </S>",
    "<S> , there is an epitaxial orientation transition at 1.5% .     </S>",
    "<S> the two distinct relative orientations of the lattice vectors and the primitive perovskite substrate matching planes in the @xmath1 structure are shown for ( a ) the @xmath2-@xmath3 phase and ( b ) the @xmath4-@xmath3 phase . ]     </S>",
    "<S> total energy per five - atom formula unit for various epitaxially constrained structures as a function of misfit strain . at each strain </S>",
    "<S> , the energy of the @xmath4-@xmath3 structure is taken as the zero of energy . </S>",
    "<S> the connecting lines are a guide to the eye . ]    </S>",
    "<S> next , we turn to the stability of the @xmath3 phases against symmetry - breaking distortions , with special attention to polar phonons . previous computation of the phonon frequencies for the bulk equilibrium structure showed three low - frequency polar phonons at 94 @xmath27 , 88 @xmath27 and 89 @xmath27 , with induced polarizations along @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath4 , respectively  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these phonons are expected to be sensitive to changes in strain , based on known polarization - strain coupling in calcium titanate  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we first consider @xmath4-@xmath1 with 4% tensile strain , with computed structural parameters reported in table 1 . a zone - center frozen phonon computation for this structure showed four unstable phonons , the lowest two , at 213i  @xmath27 and 209i  @xmath27 , being polar and generating structures with space groups @xmath28 ( polarization along @xmath9 ) and @xmath29 ( polarization along @xmath10 ) , respectively . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the orientation of polarization with respect to the primitive perovskite axes is along the @xmath5110@xmath6 directions . </S>",
    "<S> the energies of the structures for these two space groups , optimized under the epitaxial strain constraint , are 35 mev / f.u .  and 28 mev / f.u .  below @xmath4-@xmath1 , respectively , with polarizations 0.46 </S>",
    "<S> c / m@xmath30 and 0.45 c / m@xmath30 computed using born effective charges and atomic displacements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at 4% tensile strain , we predict strain - induced ferroelectricity in catio@xmath0 .    for the full range of strains </S>",
    "<S> , the unconstrained internal structural parameters were optimized within these two polar space groups . </S>",
    "<S> only in the 4% case was @xmath24 re - optimized for the polar structures ; this only had a marginal effect on the energy and the polarization compared to when the relaxed value for the @xmath4-@xmath3 structure was used , presumably because the polarizations are in the @xmath2-plane . at compressive strain , </S>",
    "<S> the nonpolar @xmath4-@xmath3 structure is stable against polar distortions , and no ferroelectricity is observed . for tensile strain , </S>",
    "<S> the ferroelectric instabilities first appear at 2% strain , and the energy gain and polarization of the optimized ferroelectric phases grow with increasing strain .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider @xmath2-@xmath3 with 4% tensile strain . </S>",
    "<S> we looked for polar instabilities in this structure by displacing atoms in such a way that the resulting , lowered symmetry allowed for nonzero polarization , and then relaxing the internal structural parameters while keeping the lattice parameters fixed at their @xmath2-@xmath3 values . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure revealed two structures with polarizations in the matching plane of 0.33 c / m@xmath30 along @xmath4 ( space group @xmath31 ) and 0.40 c / m@xmath30 along the @xmath2 diagonal ( space group @xmath32 ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ( the polarizations were obtained using born effective charges and atomic positions  @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> the former is the lowest in energy but still above @xmath28 and @xmath29 , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ totalenergy ] . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure was also carried out for epitaxial strains of 3% and @xmath221.5% . </S>",
    "<S> no polar phase was found in the latter case .    </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism of strain - induced ferroelectricity in the @xmath1 phase is closely related to that for srtio@xmath0 , which similarly has a high strain sensitivity of the low - frequency polar mode . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effect in srtio@xmath0 is equally strong for compressive as for tensile strain , as elongation of the unit cell produced by compressive strain destabilizes the polar mode as effectively as elongation in the in - plane direction for tensile strain . </S>",
    "<S> this is a direct consequence of the fact that srtio@xmath0 is cubic in the paraelectric phase ; the cubic - tetragonal transition being at low temperatures and the rotational distortion not being strong enough to inhibit the strain - enhanced polar instability .    in catio@xmath0 , in contrast , the rotational instabilities are much stronger and the resulting distortions are much larger . no ferroelectric @xmath3 phase was found for compressive strain , despite elongation of the unit cell along the direction normal to the surface ; this presumably is due to inhibition by the pattern of octahedral rotations . </S>",
    "<S> this highlights the idea that in a nonpolar low - symmetry phase , unlike in a cubic phase , the relationship between the crystal axes and the epitaxial constraints is very important , different choices yielding quite distinct structures and coupling to potential instabilities .    to investigate the relative importance of enhancing the polar instability compared to suppressing the rotational instabilities </S>",
    "<S> , we analyzed the structural parameters of the @xmath4-@xmath3 phase as a function of epitaxial strain . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes of the m@xmath7 and r@xmath8 modes change surprisingly little in the range of strains reported here , suggesting that the dominant mechanism of the strain - induced ferroelectricity is the strain enhancement of the polar instability .    </S>",
    "<S> epitaxial strain in the @xmath1 is not the only possible avenue to a ferroelectric phase . </S>",
    "<S> another promising approach is to replace the rotational pattern in the @xmath1 structure with a different pattern which allows the gain associated with the octahedral rotation instability but which is less inhibitory to the polar modes ; this will be discussed in a separate publication @xcite .    in comparing these predictions with experiments on epitaxial strained catio@xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> it is important to keep in mind that our approach considers only the effect of strain on the ground state structure and properties . in a real thin film , especially the ultrathin films needed to sustain very high strains , other factors </S>",
    "<S> can affect the observed phase , including temperature , the atomic arrangements at the substrate and the film - substrate interface , relaxation , reconstruction , and adsorption at the free surface , and defects and impurities in the film itself . </S>",
    "<S> however , the tendency to ferroelectricity with increasing tensile strain is clear in our results , and to the extent that these other factors do not act dominantly against it , we expect ferroelectricity in catio@xmath0 to be observed at experimentally accessible strains . investigations are currently in progress @xcite .    in summary , we have performed first - principles calculations for epitaxially strained structures of catio@xmath0 . at 1.5% strain </S>",
    "<S> , we find an epitaxial orientation transition between the @xmath2-@xmath3 phase , favored for compressive strains , and the @xmath4-@xmath3 phase , favored for tensile strains . for sufficiently large tensile strains , </S>",
    "<S> a polar instability , which was hidden in the equilibrium bulk structure , develops in both phases . </S>",
    "<S> the epitaxial - strain - induced ferroelectric phase lowest in energy originates in the @xmath4-@xmath3 phase and has the polarization along a @xmath5110@xmath6 direction with respect to the primitive perovskite lattice vectors of the square substrate . </S>"
