    "nearly twenty - five years ago , berry and mondragon @xcite introduced the ` neutrino billiard ' , a dirac hamiltonian describing a massless spin one - half particle in a plane with lateral confinement , as a fictitious , conceptually simple quantum system which exhibits time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) breaking without magnetic fields .",
    "they demonstrated that the energy eigenvalues of such a dirac billiard are statistically distributed according to the corresponding gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) of random matrix theory ( rmt ) , i.e.the ensemble of random hermitian matrices without trs , if the quantum system possesses a classical counterpart that is chaotic .",
    "ballistic cavities built from monolayer graphene ( for recent reviews see refs . ) with fermi energy close to the dirac point , have been proposed as realizations of such a neutrino billiard@xcite .",
    "in fact due to the coexistence of the dirac points associated with the two independent valleys in the graphene band structure , graphene - based billiards represent two copies of a dirac billiard mutually coupled through _",
    "intervalley scattering_. for vanishing intervalley coupling , the entire graphene hamiltonian is composed of two decoupled sectors with degenerate sets of eigenvalues each set obeying gue statistics just like the neutrino billiard .",
    "however , for sufficiently strong intervalley coupling , one expects an eigenvalue statistics according to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , because the entire graphene hamiltonian is time - reversal invariant , i.e.it is a real symmetric matrix in the absence of additional magnetic fields .",
    "therefore intervalley coupling is an effective symmetry restoring parameter that allows tuning from gue to goe behavior in graphene .    in disordered graphene samples ,",
    "short ranged scattering potentials or vacancies cause intervalley scattering .",
    "depending on the corresponding intervalley scattering time and other relevant inverse scattering rates of the system ( e.g.the phase coherence time ) , the magnetoconductance of disordered bulk graphene is expected to show signatures of weak localization or weak antilocalization@xcite .",
    "this theoretical picture has been confirmed experimentally to some extent by the measurement of weak localization@xcite and weak antilocalization@xcite in disordered graphene .",
    "in contrast , in ballistic graphene nanostructures ( with elastic mean free paths on scales of several microns@xcite ) , it is the edges that are responsible for intervalley scattering .",
    "however , not all types of edges are effective intervalley scatterers : while scattering of quasiparticles from a zigzag or an infinite mass type edge is an _ intravalley _ scattering process , armchair edges couple quasiparticle states from both dirac points .",
    "recent experiments on nanostructured graphene@xcite have revealed that the magnetoconductance in such samples can not be consistently described using the bulk theory of ref . and",
    "signatures of ballistic transport were found to be non - negligible . while several numerical studies have investigated quantum interference effects in spectral and transport properties of ballistic graphene nanostructures@xcite ,",
    "so far there is no analytical theory that is capable of treating quantum interference effects in arbitrarily shaped graphene nanostructures . in this work ,",
    "we provide a semiclassical theory for the conductance of ballistic graphene structures as well as for spectral correlations , particularly focusing on the effects of different edge types .",
    "our semiclassical approach requires @xmath0 with @xmath1 the fermi wavelength and @xmath2 the system size , while at the same time the energies should be compatible with the assumption of a linear dispersion law in the effective dirac theory for graphene , i.e.@xmath3 , with the graphene lattice constant @xmath4 .",
    "fortunately , both conditions are well fulfilled for most mesoscopic graphene structures : for example , for a system size of order @xmath5 100 nm , there are thousands of levels in the linear dispersion regime , where the dirac equation is valid .",
    "this is the second paper of a two - paper series on edge effects in graphene nanostructures . in the first paper @xcite ,",
    "referred to as paper i in the following , we derived an expression for the single - particle green s function of a ballistic or weakly disordered graphene structure in terms of multiple reflections from the system boundary . using this expansion",
    ", we could account for different types of boundary conditions ( zigzag , armchair , infinite mass or combinations of those ) , while the propagation inside the system was treated on the level of the effective dirac theory .",
    "furthermore , we obtained expressions for the mean density of states ( dos ) valid in the semiclassical limit , highlighting the role of edge states at zigzag boundary segments , as well as for the oscillating part of the dos in terms of periodic orbits for classically chaotic and certain integrable graphene cavities .",
    "graphene edge phenomena and the effects from sublattice and valley pseudospin dynamics enter into those trace formulae through ( traces over ) pseudospin propagators evolving along the classical orbits that otherwise are the same as in a corresponding non - relativistic billiard .    here",
    "we consider the spectral statistics of closed chaotic graphene cavities as well as the conductance of open graphene cavities coupled to ( two ) leads .",
    "we address the question as to how their universal properties are governed by the underlying dirac - type dynamics together with the graphene - specific edge effects .",
    "in particular , we study signatures of the afore mentioned crossover , mediated through intervalley scattering , between unitary and orthogonal symmetry classes in spectral and transport observables .",
    "we are thereby able to give semiclassical explanations and analytical expressions for results obtained earlier in ref . mainly numerically and in terms of symmetry arguments .",
    "there it was shown that intervalley coupling ( mediated through scattering at armchair edges ) acts differently on spectral and transport properties of classically chaotic graphene cavities : while in quantum transport a crossover from unitary to orthogonal behavior should be observable with increasing intervalley coupling , spectral statistics probing the scale of the mean level spacing is predominantly governed by the orthogonal symmetry class , even for rather weak armchair scattering . here",
    "we study the spectral statistics at energy scales larger than the mean level spacing , where the unitary symmetry should be observable even at moderate intervalley scattering .    to this end",
    "we start from the semiclassical expressions for the green s function and dos in terms of interfering classical trajectories , derived in paper i , which we introduce in sec.[sec : green - symmetry ] . in sec.[sec : spec - stat ] we address spectral fluctuations , more specifically we derive semiclassical expressions for the spectral form factor , the fourier transform of the spectral two - point correlator characterizing spectral statistics .",
    "we find that the leading order and the next to leading order contributions are strongly influenced by the edges .",
    "the total amount of armchair edges is the relevant quantity that determines the size of graphene specific correlations : our results suggest that evidence for partial ( effective ) breaking of the time reversal symmetry ( trs ) is visible in the spectral correlations at scales of many mean level spacings .",
    "the reader with main interest in transport can also skip sec.[sec : spec - stat ] and directly go to sec.[sec : transport ] , which is devoted to mesoscopic phenomena in coherent transport .",
    "we study imprints of the edges and the chaotic dynamics in confined graphene systems on weak localization , conductance fluctuations , and shot noise .",
    "we start from an exact expression for the green s function in terms of multiple scatterings from the boundary@xcite and generalize advanced semiclassical techniques , introduced in refs .",
    ", for graphene , accounting for classical trajectory correlations , which have proven essential for understanding spectral statistics and quantum phenomena in ballistic transport through chaotic schrdinger billiards .",
    "in this way we derive analytical expressions for the observables mentioned above that allow us to predict the edge dependence of several quantities in the semiclassical regime . while the details of the edge structure are crucial for the form factor , the weak localization correction and the conductance fluctuations , it turns out that shot noise is not affected to leading order in the inverse channel numbers of the leads .",
    "we finally conclude and give an outlook in sec.[sec : conclusions ] , and collect longer derivations in three appendices .",
    "in secs .  [ sec : spec - stat ] and [ sec : transport ] we employ the green s function in order to study correlations in the spectra and the conductance of graphene flakes in the semiclassical limit . in paper",
    "i we derived an exact expression for the green s function of a graphene flake in terms of a multiple reflection expansion , where each term in this expansion corresponds to the sum of feynman paths with a specific number of reflections at the system boundary . in this section",
    "we repeat our main results that will be useful for the present paper .    for a confined ballistic graphene structure quasiparticle dynamics",
    "is described by the effective dirac hamiltonian @xmath6 with appropriate boundary conditions at the edges . here",
    "the @xmath7 denote pauli matrices in sublattice pseudospin space and pauli matrices in valley - spin space are represented by @xmath8 , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are unit matrices acting on the corresponding spin space .",
    "then the full green s function is given in the semiclassical limit by ( cf .",
    "( 78 ) in i ) @xmath11 here the sum runs over all _ classical orbits _",
    "@xmath12 leading from point @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "these classical orbits consist of straight lines that are connected by specular reflections at the boundary , so that the condition of least action is satisfied .",
    "this situation is similar to billiards with spin orbit interaction ( soi ) where the entire effect of the soi is contained in the spin matrix with the same trajectories@xcite . in eq.([eq : gsc ] ) @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the classical action ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the fermi momentum and the length , respectively ) and the number of conjugate points for the classical orbit @xmath12 , and @xmath19 denotes an element of the stability matrix of the path @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the components of the initial momentum and final position perpendicular to the trajectory . in eq .",

    "runs over all @xmath24 reflections that occur at boundary points @xmath25 along the orbit @xmath12 , with the edge dependent pseudospin rotations for reflections at zigzag ( zz ) , armchair ( ac ) , and infinite mass ( i m ) type edges @xmath26 here @xmath27 denotes the reflection angle at the @xmath28-th bounce with the boundary , while @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the direction of the tangent to the boundary and the @xmath31-coordinate of the reflection point @xmath25 , respectively ( see fig.[fig : refangle ] ) .",
    "further we define for a given vector @xmath32 the pauli matrix @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is the distance of the dirac points from the @xmath35-point of the brillouin zone . for reflections at infinite mass type edges , the sign in eq.([eq : k_i ] )",
    "is equal to the sign of the mass potential outside of the system@xcite . for zigzag edges",
    "the sign is determined by the type of sublattice at the zigzag edge .",
    "for an a - edge , the upper sign is valid and for a b - edge the lower sign . for armchair edges ,",
    "the upper sign is valid when the order of the atoms within each dimer is @xmath36-@xmath37 along the direction of @xmath29 , and the lower sign is valid for @xmath37-@xmath36 ordering .",
    "equations ( [ eq : gsc ] - [ eq : k_i ] ) specify the contribution of a given classical orbit @xmath12 to the semiclassical green s function . note that the dynamical part is identical to the semiclassical green s function of a schrdinger system , while it is the pseudospin propagator @xmath38 , through which the graphene specific physics enters .",
    "this relation allows us to use many results from the semiclassical theory of schrdinger billiards .          in order to compare the results from our semiclassical theory with universal rmt predictions , we need to consider the relevant antiunitary symmetries of the hamiltonian @xmath39 , eq.([eq : ham ] )",
    "an antiunitary operator is given by the complex conjugation followed by a unitary operator .",
    "we assume that all spatial symmetries , such as invariance under reflection or rotation , are broken .",
    "thus the only relevant unitary operations are rotations in the pseudospin spaces .",
    "as mentioned above we adapt here the valley - isotropic basis , in which the bulk hamiltonian is invariant under the transformations @xmath40",
    "with@xcite @xmath41 furthermore we note that @xmath42 while .",
    "that means @xmath43 , the overall trs that connects states from opposite valleys , drives the system into the orthogonal symmetry class .",
    "this symmetry is not broken by any of the boundaries we consider .",
    "however , we will see that it is only relevant if intervalley scattering is present . in the absence of intervalley scattering ,",
    "the effective intravalley trs @xmath44 gives rise to the symplectic universality class .",
    "however , for the boundary conditions that do not couple the valleys ( infinite mass , zigzag ) , @xmath44 is not preserved , and thus it is irrelevant for ballistic systems . finally @xmath45 is also a symplectic symmetry .",
    "it is broken by intervalley scattering armchair edges and left intact by zigzag or infinite mass type edges . for preserved valleys",
    "it thus ensures the ( kramers ) degeneracy of the two valleys .",
    "we note that , since the bulk hamiltonian has a particle - hole symmetry ( @xmath46 ) , the chiral universality classes are relevant at zero energy . in this paper , however , we consider fermi energies away from zero , where the normal and the chiral universality classes lead to the same results@xcite .    sections [ sec : spec - stat ] on spectral statistics and sec.[sec : transport ] on transport can both be read independently .",
    "we begin with the analysis of spectral statistics which is conceptually slightly simpler .",
    "quite generally , the dos can be split into a smooth part , i.e.the mean dos @xmath47 , and an oscillating part @xmath48 , @xmath49 while @xmath47 contains information about the coarse structure of the spectrum , details about the level distribution are in @xmath48 .",
    "the mean dos @xmath47 and the trace formulae for the oscillating dos @xmath48 were addressed in i. here we use the trace formula for @xmath48 to study statistical properties of the spectral fluctuations . to this end , we focus on the spectral two - point correlator @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes averaging over a ( classically ) small window of the fermi energy @xmath52 or , respectively , on its fourier transform the spectral form factor @xmath53 here @xmath54 denotes the time in units of the heisenberg time @xmath55 . in the limit @xmath56 , rmt predicts the universal expression@xcite @xmath57 which is expected to be valid for chaotic systems .",
    "systems with a trs @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( e.g. a free electron without magnetic field ) belong to the orthogonal symmetry class and systems without trs ( e.g. an electron in a magnetic field ) to the unitary class .",
    "systems with a trs @xmath58 and @xmath60 ( e.g. a spin 1/2 particle with broken spin rotational symmetry ) are members of the symplectic class .",
    "however , as mentioned above , for ballistic graphene flakes the edges break the symmetry @xmath44 that would lead to the symplectic universality class . in the presence of spin - orbit interaction , which we neglect in this paper , the symplectic class could be relevant .        for chaotic schrdinger billiards , it is possible@xcite to connect the properties of classical orbits to @xmath61 . using this relation",
    "the universal rmt form factor ( [ eq : frmt2 ] ) has been derived semiclassically using gutzwiller s trace formula@xcite for schrdinger systems . in the following",
    "we will extend this semiclassical theory to describe the spectral correlations of chaotic graphene systems .",
    "we start by the following extension of gutzwiller s trace formula ( see eq.(103 ) in i ) to graphene : @xmath62 here the sum runs over infinitely many _ periodic _ classical orbits @xmath12 .",
    "the classical amplitudes @xmath63 depend on the period , the stability and the number of conjugated points of the corresponding orbit@xcite . as mentioned above ,",
    "the trace over the pseudospin propagator @xmath38 accounts for the graphene features .    from eqs.([eq",
    ": pspinprop],[eq : k_i ] ) we know that the valley part of @xmath38 contains an off - diagonal factor @xmath64 for every reflection at an armchair edge .",
    "this implies that the trace vanishes , @xmath65 , unless the total number of ac reflections @xmath66 along @xmath12 is even .",
    "if @xmath66 is even , the pseudospin factor we have for an orbit with a total number of @xmath67 reflections is ( see app.[app : pspintrace_1 ] ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a phase factor that depends on the exact sequence of ac , zz , and i m type reflections , @xmath70 is the sum over all reflection angles @xmath27 along the orbit @xmath12 , @xmath71 measures the differences in the @xmath31-coordinate of pairs of subsequent ac reflection points , and @xmath72 in eq.([eq : vartheta_def ] ) the sum is restricted to the @xmath73 reflections at zz edges along @xmath12 , and @xmath74 is the number of ac reflections that occur _ after _ the specific zz reflection @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore @xmath75 for reflections at @xmath36-edges and @xmath76 for reflections at @xmath37-edges .",
    "we note that @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath12 are time reversed partners in the classical sense , i.e.they are identical up to the direction of movement .",
    "we now evaluate the spectral form factor for graphene semiclassically .",
    "we insert eq.([eq : gutzwiller ] ) into the definition of @xmath61 and obtain the approximate expression @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the period of an orbit , @xmath81 , and the short notation for the pseudospin traces @xmath82 the action difference between the orbits is given by @xmath83 .",
    "if @xmath84 is an arbitrary , uncorrelated pair of orbits , @xmath85 is generically a rapidly oscillating function of @xmath17 in the semiclassical limit .",
    "thus after @xmath17 averaging , the corresponding contribution to @xmath86 vanishes and the relevant contributions to @xmath86 come from classes of orbit pairs with small or even vanishing action difference .",
    "that means the actions of the orbits have to be classically correlated .",
    "the most obvious class of correlated orbit pairs are captured by the so - called diagonal approximation , where only equal action pairs @xmath87 ( and @xmath88 ) are considered .",
    "these orbit pairs give rise to the leading order ( @xmath89 ) terms in the expansion ( [ eq : frmt2 ] ) for @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the second order terms ( @xmath90 ) in the goe case are connected to another class of periodic orbit pairs : loop contributions that are sketched in fig.[fig : figure8 ] .",
    "these two orbits follow each other closely for most of the time but one of them has a self - crossing ( @xmath91 ) while the other one avoids   this crossing ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "therefore the propagation directions are the same in one part of the paths ( @xmath2 ) and opposite in the other part ( r ) @xcite .    in the following",
    "we study the diagonal contribution and the off - diagonal loop corrections ( fig.[fig : figure8 ] ) to @xmath61 for graphene billiards .",
    "we find that both contributions depend on the structure of the edges due to the interplay between the boundary conditions and the ( effective ) trs of graphene flakes .      for the diagonal terms in the double sum ( [ eq : fsc ] ) , the spectral form factor reads ( including pairs @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) @xmath94 equation ( [ eq : trace - k ] ) yields for the product of traces ( [ eq : defz ] ) @xmath95 provided that the total number of ac reflections @xmath66 along @xmath12 is even , otherwise @xmath96 .",
    "since @xmath12 is a periodic orbit , the total rotation angle is @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the integer winding number .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 count the reflections with positive or negative reflection angles , respectively .",
    "this leads to @xmath102 and thus for even @xmath66 @xmath103",
    "+ for pedagogical reasons , we first consider the simpler case of billiards whose boundaries consist only of a combination of zz and i m type edges . in other words",
    "we assume that @xmath104 for all orbits , so that there is no intervalley coupling at all . in order to perform the orbit sum in eq.([eq : fsc ] ) we need to average @xmath105 accordingly . to perform this averaging , we first note that classically chaotic billiards exhibit ergodic dynamics , thus a long orbit will hit all boundary points with the same probability .",
    "therefore we average @xmath105 over the possible edge types or boundary conditions , respectively . since we assume that no ac edge are present @xmath106 in eq.([eq : zgg ] ) .",
    "if no zz edges are present either , also @xmath107 , otherwise @xmath108 is randomly distributed between zero and @xmath109 . in both cases",
    "the squared cosine in ( [ eq : zgg ] ) is on average @xmath110 , since for long orbits even and odd @xmath111 are equally probable .",
    "that means we obtain @xmath112 now we can pull @xmath113 out of the sum in ( [ eq : fd_sep1 ] ) and are left with the evaluation of the form factor as in the schrdinger case . by employing the sum rule@xcite we obtain@xcite @xmath114 according to eq.([eq : frmt2 ] ) this result is four times the gue prediction for the linear term of @xmath61 . to understand the factor of four we recall the antiunitary symmetries of the problem .",
    "the physical trs @xmath43 would lead to the orthogonal symmetry class .",
    "however , since there is no intervalley scattering and @xmath43 connects states from different valleys , it is basically irrelevant . the effective intravalley trs @xmath44 , which would lead to a symplectic ensemble , is broken by both zigzag and infinite mass type edges .",
    "hence we end up with two unitary subsystems that are kramers degenerate partners due to the remaining symmetry @xmath45 . equations ( [ eq : rdef ] ) and ( [ eq : fdef ] ) yield @xmath115 in this case , where @xmath116 is the form factor of the non - degenerate subsystem .",
    "the loop contribution ( see below ) agrees with this picture .",
    "+       + when there is no ac scattering , the valleys are uncoupled and we have @xmath154 we decompose the angles @xmath155 into @xmath156 and thus obtain @xmath157 the averaged pseudospin contribution to @xmath147 vanishes @xmath158 because the angles @xmath159 and @xmath160 have to be averaged separately , and thus the cosine terms and the sine terms cancel on average .",
    "this result holds also if zz edges are absent and all reflections happen at i m edges . in the latter case @xmath161 and",
    "therefore @xmath162 is either identically zero ( odd @xmath111 ) or @xmath163 ( even @xmath111 ) , leading again to eq.([eq : zavl_1 ] ) , because for long orbits there are equally many orbits with even and odd @xmath164@xcite .",
    "that means there is _ no loop contribution _ to the spectral form factor , @xmath165 if there are no intervalley scattering ac edges .",
    "+ we consider the opposite limit and assume that all reflections happen at ac edges .",
    "the term @xmath117 can only take discrete values @xmath118 for a generic boundary , @xmath119 is random and thus the average of the pseudospin contribution ( [ eq : zgg ] ) reads @xmath120 .",
    "consequently we obtain the diagonal contribution to the spectral form factor @xmath121 in agreement with the rmt prediction for the orthogonal symmetry class .",
    "the orthogonal symmetry is expected because the intervalley mixing due to the armchair scattering restores the trs described by @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "+       + in the opposite limit of dominant ac scattering , eq.([eq : trkgtrkgx ] ) gives for even @xmath166 @xmath167 to average this , we have to distinguish between two different cases .",
    "first we assume that @xmath164 , the number of reflections in the @xmath148-part of @xmath12 , is even .",
    "then @xmath168 and @xmath169 are well defined and we have @xmath170 from the trigonometric relation analog to eq.([eq : trig_1 ] ) it follows that these orbits do not contribute on average . on the other hand if @xmath164 is odd , it is straight - forward to show that @xmath171 and therefore for even @xmath111 @xmath172 since only orbits with even @xmath111 and odd @xmath164 contribute we obtain for the average @xmath173 that is the graphene specific pseudospin trace enters merely with an overall prefactor 2 to the spectral form factor .",
    "the rest of the calculation is identical to evaluation of the semiclassical form factor in ref .. the full contribution of pairs of orbits @xmath174 is obtained by summing over all @xmath12 and for each @xmath12 counting the number of self encounters , i.e.  self intersections with a ( small ) crossing angle @xmath175 .",
    "we introduce @xmath176 as a measure for the density of self crossings of an orbit of length @xmath177@xcite , @xmath178\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath179 with @xmath180 the average lyapunov exponent and @xmath181 a constant , is the minimal time to form a closed loop .",
    "then the angular integral over the exponents of the phase differences is computed , leading to@xcite @xmath182 as for a schrdinger billiard@xcite .",
    "evaluating the remaining orbit sum similar to eq.([eq : fd_sep1 ] ) yields @xmath183 in agreement with the rmt prediction [ cf .",
    "eq.([eq : frmt2 ] ) ] for the goe .",
    "+       + for very strong armchair scattering , @xmath276 , the well known lorentzian magnetoconductance profile@xcite is restored , @xmath277 describing the usual goe @xmath206 gue transition , where the total wl signal has a size of approximately @xmath278 for identical leads in the limit of large channel numbers .",
    "since the valleys are completely mixed , the trs @xmath43 is active at @xmath279 , leading to the orthogonal universality class .",
    "the magnetic field breaks @xmath43 , driving the system into the unitary class .",
    "+    [ [ weak - ac - scattering ] ] weak ac scattering + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +     + for very weak ac scattering , @xmath280 , eq.([eq : gl ] ) becomes @xmath281 that is the wl correction vanishes linearly with @xmath282 , reflecting ( partial ) effective trs breaking .",
    "the overall trs associated with the antiunitary operator @xmath43 is intact for zero magnetic field , implying orthogonal symmetry .",
    "however , in the limit of vanishing ac scattering , @xmath283 , the hamiltonian is block diagonal and @xmath43 is ineffective since it connects states from different valleys . within each valley",
    "the effective trs associated with @xmath44 is broken by the zz and i m boundary conditions thus @xmath273 is suppressed but never becomes positive .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of disordered bulk samples with small intervalley scattering rate , where the symmetry corresponding to @xmath44 is not broken leading to weak anti - localization @xcite .",
    "that means we have two ( nearly ) decoupled unitary subsystems that lead to vanishing ( or strongly suppressed ) wl .",
    "we point out that the magnetoconductance curves described by eq.([eq : gl_weak_ac ] ) are squared lorentzians and thus steeper and more narrow than lorentzians with the same height ( cf .",
    "dashed blue line in fig.[fig : gl ] ) .",
    "that means the magnetic dephasing is essentially assisted by the partial trs breaking .",
    "+ in fig.[fig : gl ] we summarize our findings graphically . the main panel shows the dependence of the wl correction on the magnetic flux , or @xmath284 , respectively , for different values of the ratio @xmath282 . as the ac scattering becomes stronger , the magnetoconductance gets closer to the lorentzian behavior known from usual 2degs .",
    "the inset shows the crossover as a function of @xmath282 for the case of zero magnetic flux .",
    "+ to obtain eq.([eq : gl ] ) , we have assumed that the ehrenfest time @xmath285 is much smaller than the dwell time @xmath241 and thus neglected terms of order @xmath286 or higher .",
    "@xmath287 is the time scale after which a minimal wave packet in a chaotic cavity has spread over the whole system , so that quantum interference is possible@xcite . for schrdinger systems it is known@xcite that a finite ehrenfest time leads to an exponential suppression of the wl correction .",
    "since for graphene the ac scattering enters the integral ( [ eq : modloopdens_g ] ) in a similar way as the magnetic dephasing time , the semiclassical calculation@xcite is unchanged . thus performing the integrals in eq.([eq : sigl_ints ] ) for finite @xmath286",
    ", the wl is suppressed in the same way also here , namely in eq.([eq : gl ] ) we get an overall exponential suppression @xmath288      in fig.[fig : gl_tb ] we compare our analytical results with the conductance obtained from numerical tight binding simulations . here",
    "we consider a graphene cavity with the shape of a desymmetrized half stadium giving rise to chaotic scattering@xcite .",
    "we model infinite mass boundaries by adding a smooth mass term close to the edges of the system ( for details see ref . ) .",
    "in order to tune @xmath127 we cut a hole into the smooth mass so that locally a small region with armchair edges is present .",
    "the system is shown schematically as an inset in fig.[fig : gl_tb ] .",
    "we then calculate the magnetoconductance numerically ( the inset shows three examples ) using an adaptive recursive green s function method @xcite and obtain @xmath273 as the difference of @xmath289 at zero flux and @xmath290 .",
    "the main panel in fig.[fig : gl_tb ] compares the absolute value of the wl correction obtained in this way with the semiclassical prediction ( [ eq : gl_zerophi ] ) .",
    "we find that the numerical data reproduces our semiclassical theory very well ( dashed line ) .",
    "the agreement is even better if we assume an effective offset in @xmath132 of five lattice constants , @xmath291 ( solid line ) .",
    "this offset can be explained by the fact that our smooth mass edges can not completely avoid intervalley scattering from armchair edges or sharp edges at the boundary , e.g.at the lead mouths .",
