    "the number of nambu - goldstone modes coincides with that of pion fields @xmath106 and the number of  eaten \" nambu - goldstone modes by gauge fields is that of pion fields .",
    "however , in the case without lorentz invariance , the number of pion fields and the nambu - goldstone modes do not always coincide and hence it is not clear whether the number of the  eaten \" nambu - goldstone modes coincides with that of the pion fields or nambu - goldstone modes .",

    "we note that if the first term is zero for some @xmath105 in this sector , both one - time and two - time derivative terms for some @xmath135 disappear , because @xmath136 in @xmath130",

    "furthermore we classify these into  first - class \" and  second - class \" constraints . in the first - class constraints ,",

    "though @xmath140 are not equal to @xmath141 in general , these values do not affect the classification scheme because these terms can be set to @xmath141 with the redefinition of @xmath142 by adding the linear combination of the constraints @xmath143 and @xmath144 for @xmath130 . from eqs.([k32]-[k35 ] ) , we conclude each type of constraints : @xmath145 thus we find that the number of the constraints is given as follows : @xmath146    as a result , the physical degrees of freedom in the higgs system without lorentz invariance are found to be @xmath147 where we used @xmath148 . comparing eqs .",
    "( [ k38 ] ) with ( [ k16 ] ) , we conclude the degrees of freedom of the gauge fields in this system coincide with those of the nambu - goldstone bosons ( the first term ) and pure gauge fields ( the second term ) .",
    "thus all of the nambu - goldstone modes are absorbed by the gauge fields .",
    "this notable fact implies that it is irrelevant for the degrees of freedom in the higgs system whether the system includes type - i , type - ii , or massive nambu - goldstone modes , but the existence or non - existence of two - time derivative terms are essential . particularly in the system with one - time derivative terms and without two - time derivative terms , the absorbed nambu - goldstone modes are just type - ii nambu - goldstone modes , while in the system with one - time and two - time derivative terms , those are type - ii and massive nambu - goldstone modes .",
    "we give two examples of the higgs systems without lorentz invariance : a gauged ferromagnet model and su(2 ) higgs - kibble model with the fixed length of the higgs field at finite chemical potential @xmath149 .      in a ferromagnet system corresponding to the case of @xmath150 o(3 ) and @xmath151o(2 ) , the effective lagrangian does not include the two - time derivative terms and thus one type - ii nambu - goldstone mode without the massive ones appears @xcite .",

    "the consistency conditions for @xmath160 appear : @xmath161 because of the first term , the consistency conditions for @xmath162 are satisfied with the determination of the lagrange multiplier @xmath163",
    ". therefore all constraints are obtained .",
    "next , we classify these constraints into first - class and second - class constraints . the possion brackets between these constraints",
    "are given as follows : @xmath164 and other possion brackets are zero except for @xmath165 . with the redefinition of @xmath166 by taking the linear combination of @xmath167 , @xmath168",
    "reduce to zero .",
    "thus , the first - class constraints are @xmath169 and @xmath159 and the second - class constraints are @xmath170 and @xmath171 the degrees of freedom absorbed by gauge fields are @xmath172 corresponding to the number of the nambu - goldstone mode in this system .",
    "this also suggests that @xmath173 degrees of freedom appear in the spectrum at least perturbatively .",
    "if su(2 ) higgs - kibble model at finite chemical potential @xmath149 does not include gauge fields , the type - i , type - ii and massive nambu - goldstone modes appear and the reduction of degrees of freedom does not occur @xcite . by fixing the radial degree of freedom for the scaler field corresponding to the higgs field , the lagrangian reduces to the effective lagrangian in the case of one- and two - time derivatives characterized by @xmath150 su(2 ) and @xmath174 .",
    "therefore su(2 ) higgs - kibble model at finite chemical potential @xmath149 without fluctuation of the higgs field also correspond to one of the model analyzed in sec.[constraints for higgs ] . in this case , the lagrangian in unitary gauge may be expressed just by the gauge fields , @xmath175 with @xmath176    now we consider the constraints of this system .",
    "the primary constraints are given by @xmath157 and the consistency condition for the time evolution of the primary constraints are given by @xmath177 note that the last term leads to the determination of the lagrange multiplier with the consistent condition for the time evolution .",
    "this means that all of the constraints,@xmath178 and @xmath121 , are second - class ones .",
    "thus the number of absorbed nambu - goldstone modes is @xmath179 corresponding to the total number of type - i , type - ii and massive nambu - goldstone modes .",
    "in conclusion , we have first elucidated the influence of two - time derivative terms in the effective lagrangian without lorentz invariance on the counting rule for nambu - goldstone bosons . in this case ,",
    "type - i , type - ii and massive nambu - goldstone bosons may appear .",
    "in the systems with both one - time and two - time derivative terms , type - ii nambu - goldstone bosons are accompanied by the massive bosons and the degrees of freedom are not reduced , whereas in the system with one - time and without two - time derivative terms , only type - ii bosons appear and the degrees of freedom are reduced .",
    "the difference reflects in the higgs phenomenon in a striking way .",
    "we have shown that the number of the eaten physical degrees of freedom by the gauge fields does not coincide with that of the broken symmetries , but that of nambu - goldstone bosons , which suggests that these degrees of freedom appear in the spectrum .",
