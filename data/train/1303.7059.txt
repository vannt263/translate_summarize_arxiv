    "recently , the number of known long period variables ( lpvs ) has increased dramatically thanks to the analyses for the extensive photometric data from various gravitational microlensing surveys , massive compact halo object ( macho ) , optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) , exprience de recherche dobjets sombres ( eros ) , and mirolensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "analyzing photometric data of red giants brighter than @xmath5 in macho survey of the lmc , @xcite found several sequences in the period - luminosity ( pl ) plane with periods ranging from about 20 to a thousand days .",
    "they named these sequences a , b , c , e , and d from shorter to longer periods , in which the sequence c coincides with the known pl relation of mira variables .",
    "later @xcite found that sequence c which corresponds to overtone mira variables can be isolated from the sequence b. from the light curves , sequence e is attributed to eclipsing binaries @xcite .",
    "sequence d is sometimes called long secondary periods ( lsps ) because in those stars , shorter period pulsations are superposed on a lsp of about 400  1500 days .",
    "although the origin of the sequence d is discussed by several authors , it is not settled yet ( a historical account on lpvs is given in e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in this paper",
    "we do not consider stars on sequence d.    @xcite isolated ogle small amplitude red giants ( osargs ) from the lpvs .",
    "the osargs can be divided into two groups ; red - giant branch ( rgb ) stars less luminous than the giant tip ( corresponding to the occurrence of the core helium flash ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "@xcite identified three ridges in the pl plane for the rgb osargs named b@xmath6 , b@xmath1 and b@xmath7 from longer to shorter periods ; b@xmath1 and b@xmath7 apparently correspond to sequence b and a of @xcite , and b@xmath8 and a@xmath8 of @xcite , respectively .",
    "furthermore , b@xmath6 , b@xmath1 and b@xmath7 correspond to r@xmath6 , r@xmath1 , and r@xmath7 discussed by @xcite from ogle - ii data .",
    "similarly , @xcite named four agb osargs as a@xmath6 , a@xmath1 , a@xmath7 and a@xmath0 . in this paper",

    "the structure of the distribution is more clearly seen in fig.[psd002 ] .",
    "we see two major ridges in fig.[psd002 ] at @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; the former corresponds to the period ratios between b@xmath7 and b@xmath6 , and the latter is formed by the ratios b@xmath25b@xmath6 and b@xmath26b@xmath1 .",
    "the additional ridges at @xmath27 and @xmath28 are attributed to the presence of sub - ridges in the p - l plane along b@xmath1 and b@xmath7 as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the less densely populated ridges in fig.[psd002 ] at @xmath29 and @xmath30 might be associated with the sub - ridges of b@xmath1 and b@xmath7 .",
    "these sub - ridges strongly suggest the presence of nonradial pulsations in osargs .",
    "we note that the petersen diagram ( fig.[psd002 ] ) has an advantage over the period - luminosity diagram such as fig.[pld001 ] in comparing theoretical results with observation to determine pulsation modes .",
    "obviously the pl diagram is affected by errors in luminosities and stellar radii , while only the accuracy in periods for each star matters in the petersen diagram .",
    "therefore , we use petersen diagrams to determine pulsation modes for the period - luminosity sequences , b@xmath31 b@xmath7 .",
    "in order to identify pulsation modes for each of the corresponding osarg(rgb ) pl relations , we have calculated linear nonadiabatic radial and non - radial pulsation periods for envelope models along evolutionary tracks .",
    "the evolutionary models were calculated by using the mesa stellar evolution code @xcite for initial masses of 0.9 , 1.0 , 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , 1.4 and 1.6@xmath32 , in which wind mass loss is included by adopting reimers formula @xcite @xmath33 with @xmath34 . for our canonical models ,",
    "we have adopted a chemical composition of @xmath35 and a mixing - length of 1.5 pressure scale height .",
    "( we discuss the effects of changing these parameters later in this paper . )",
    "opacity tables of opal @xcite with low - temperature extension by @xcite were used .",
    "envelope models for radial and nonradial pulsation analyses were calculated at selected evolutionary stages of each evolutionary track .",
    "we set the surface boundary at @xmath36=0.001 for the envelope calculations with @xmath36 being the optical depth associated with the rosseland - mean opacity .",
    "@xcite discussed the uncertainties in the pulsation properties caused by various assumptions around the outer boundary of agb models . to check the influence of the particular place of the outer boundary , we have calculated models imposing the outer boundary condition at @xmath36=0.01 .",
    "we have found that the difference in periods is less than a few percent , and that the period ratios are hardly different . for radial pulsations we set the bottom of an envelope arbitrarily at @xmath37 . for nonradial pulsations we set the inner boundary just below the convective envelope , suppressing possible coupling with high order core g - modes .",
    "this is justified because only p - modes completely trapped in the convective envelope can be excited to observable amplitudes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "linear nonadiabatic analyses for radial and nonradial pulsations were performed using the codes described in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in both cases convection - pulsation coupling",
    "is disregarded by neglecting the perturbation of the divergence of the convective flux .",
    "convective turnover time in the convective envelope of a typical model for rgb osargs varies from much longer ( deep interior ) to shorter ( in the outer layers ) than low - order pulsation periods .",
    "this indicates that we should not trust the stability results of our analyses .",
    "for this reason we used only periods from these codes disregarding the stability results .",
    "we compared our periods and period ratios with fig.3 of @xcite , in which the effect of convection - pulsation interaction is included , and found our results to be consistent with their values .",
    "this confirms that the convection - pulsation coupling hardly affects periods , and justifies the use of our theoretical periods .",
    "this is understandable because the nonadiabaticity is not very strong in the rgb models and the nonadiabatic periods are very close to the adiabatic ones .",
    "finally , the fact that the convective turnover time is comparable to the pulsation periods in some layers in the envelope is favorable for the pulsations to be stochastically excited by turbulent convection .",
    "the period of a pulsation mode is approximately proportional to @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the mean density ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , which depends on the stellar mass and radius .",
    "generally the dependence of the periods ratios on these two parameters is rather weak .",
    "in addition , fig.[psd002 ] indicates the period ratios depend only weakly on period . for that reason ,",
    "the period ratios are useful for determining pulsation modes , while pulsation periods are used to determine the appropriate luminosity ( or mass ) ranges .",
    "first , we determine which radial modes are excited in the rgb osargs .",
    "figs.[psd003 ] and [ psd004 ] compare observed period ratios with theoretical ones formed by the radial fundamental ( f ) , 1st ( 1o ) , 2nd ( 2o ) , and 3rd ( 3o ) overtone periods along a part of the evolutionary track ( @xmath40 ) of an initial mass of @xmath41 .",
    "the luminosity range roughly corresponds to that of rgb osargs .",
    "fig.[psd003 ] shows the ratios involving fundamental mode ( denoted as f )",
    ". obviously none of the period ratios involving the fundamental mode agrees with any major ridges around 0.5 or 0.7 .",
    "this indicates that the fundamental mode is not responsible for any of the period - luminosity sequences , b@xmath6 , b@xmath1 , and b@xmath7 . for this reason we do not consider the radial fundamental mode any further .",
    "models are compared to the observed ratios of osargs in the lmc ( red dots ) .",
    "the solid line shows the first overtone to fundamental period ratio ( 1o / f ) , while the dashed line is for the 2o / f ratio and the dotted line is for the 3o / f ratio .",
    "these lines do not fit with any of the ridges in the distribution of osarg period ratio , indicating that fundamental mode are not excited in the rgb osargs.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     but for period ratios without fundamental mode .",
    "the solid , dashed and dotted lines show the ratios between radial overtones as indicated .",
    "the 3o/2o and 2o/1o ratios go through close to the ridge around 0.7 , while the 3o/1o ratio goes through the ridge at 0.5 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    fig.[psd004 ] shows that the ratio of the third overtone to the first overtone ( 3o/1o ) is close to 0.5 in the middle of the luminosity range agreeing with the b@xmath7/b@xmath6 ratio .",
    "in addition , the period ratios of 2o/1o and 3o/2o are around 0.7 in the middle of the luminosity range , although they do not go through the central part of the ridge . from these comparisons",
    "we conclude that the radial first , second , and third overtones correspond to , respectively , the b@xmath6 , b@xmath1 , and b@xmath7 sequences of the rgb osargs .",
    "we note that @xcite was unable to explain the period - luminosity sequences b@xmath1 and b@xmath7 by assigning the first overtone ( 1o ) to b@xmath1 and the second overtone ( 2o ) to b@xmath7 .",
    "our identifications differ by one order ; i.e. , 2o to b@xmath1 and 3o to b@xmath7 .",
    "fig.[psd004 ] indicates that the theoretical relations of @xmath41 models can not explain the period ratios for the whole period range of the rgb osargs .",
    "they agree with the observed ratios only in a period range of @xmath42 which corresponds to a luminosity range of @xmath43 .",
    "this means that we have to apply models having different initial masses for different luminosity ( hence period ) ranges . in other words , the running of the pl relations must be explained by not the stellar evolution of a single mass star , but the evolution of stars with a range of initial masses .",
    "we will discuss different mass models in the next subsection .    here , we consider period ratios involving nonradial pulsations in our @xmath44 models in the luminosity range @xmath43 .",
    "figs.[psd006 ] and [ psd007 ] show period ratios between dipole ( @xmath45 ) and radial modes , and quadrupole ( @xmath46 ) and radial modes , respectively , where solid lines , lines with triangles , lines with filled circles correspond to the ratios with 1o , 2o , 3o , respectively .",
    "nonradial modes considered are p@xmath47 for both @xmath45 and 2 .",
    "fig.[psd006 ] indicates that among the dipole modes , only p@xmath0 is consistent with all the observed ridges in the petersen diagram .",
    "this mode explains the @xmath48 sub - ridge by paring with 1o ( b@xmath6 ) , the @xmath24 major ridge by paring with 2o ( b@xmath1 ) , and @xmath49 by paring with 3o ( b@xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore , we can identity the dipole @xmath50 p@xmath0-mode as a sub - ridge of b@xmath7 .",
    "fig.[psd007 ] indicates that for the quadrupole ( @xmath46 ) modes , p@xmath1-mode yields period ratios consistent with the observed ones ; ratios with o1 and o3 correspond to the central ridge at @xmath24 and the ratio with o2 corresponds to the ridge at @xmath28 .",
    "this means that quadrupole p@xmath1-mode corresponds to a sub - ridge of b@xmath1 .",
    "this figure might also indicate the possible presence of p@xmath51 as a sub - ridge of b@xmath6 .",
    "more data are needed to confirm its presence .",
    "in summary , we have identified 1o for b@xmath6 , 2o and p@xmath52 for b@xmath1 , and 3o and p@xmath53 for b@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite argued that each of the sequences b@xmath1 and b@xmath7 has two sub - ridges in addition to a main ridge , while our mode identifications explain only one sub- and main ridge pair .",
    "second sub - ridges , if real , might correspond to higher degree ( @xmath54 ) modes .",
    "also , the ratios with the second sub - ridge within each of sequences b@xmath1 and b@xmath7 might be consistent with the period ratios around 0.98 ( e.g. , fig.[psd007 ] ) which we can not explain with our mode identifications .",
    "it is interesting that the main part of the ridge at @xmath55 is reproduced by the ratios involving nonradial pulsations .",

    "some other nonradial modes may be involved because clumps in the period - ratios and ridges in the pl plane are broad .",

    "although different choices for the parameters would shift the mass ranges , mode identifications are not affected because the period ratios hardly depend on these parameters .",
    "the sequence b@xmath6 is fitted by radial 1o , b@xmath1 by radial 2o and nonradial p@xmath52 , and b@xmath7 by radial 3o and nonradial p@xmath53 modes .",
    "the reason why only the two nonradial modes are observed is not clear .",
    "the scaled @xmath4 of solar - like oscillations evaluated with our model parameters goes through roughly the middle of the three ridges populated by rgb osargs in the period - luminosity plane .",
    "in addition , the period - luminosity relations look like a high - luminosity extension of the solar - like oscillations recently detected by the kepler satellite in g / k giants of the open clusters ngc 6791 and ngc 6819 .",
    "these facts strongly suggest that pulsations in osargs are stochastically excited by turbulent convections .",
