    "convective flows in low - prandtl - number fluids in the presence of magnetic field have been studied for many years due to its importance in geophysical and astrophysical problems  @xcite . generally this flow is called magneto convection .",
    "there are also industrial applications of this kind of flow in crystal growth  @xcite and in fusion reactor as heat exchanger  @xcite .",
    "there has been extensive theoretical and numerical studies of thermal convection in fluids in presence of external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "these studies reveal the stabilizing effect of the magnetic field on convective flow . in several experiments",
    "@xcite it have been shown that magnetic field affects the convective flow strongly .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of horizontal magnetic field , both in the longitudinal and the transverse directions , on wavy roll instability in a rayleigh - bnard experiment with mercury .",
    "they found that the horizontal magnetic field inhibited the oscillatory instability and made the convection two dimensional .",

    "@xcite and hof et .",
    "@xcite considered the effect of external horizontal magnetic field on low - prandtl - number thermal convection and found that the magnetic field delayed the onset of wavy instability .",
    "so magnetic field typically inhibits the oscillatory instability but there are situations when magnetic field can stimulate instabilities  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a better understanding is necessary for this kind of flow .",
    "numerical simulations complement experiments because very low - prandtl - number fluids can not be achieved in the laboratory .",
    "even the fluids like mercury ( @xmath7 ) do not allow very good visualization in experiments .",
    "however , the simulations are costly in terms of computer time .",
    "the simulations , due to large number of modes , often makes the understanding of the basic physics of convective flow difficult . here",
    ", low - dimensional models play a very important roll .",
    "low - dimensional models are useful for modeling large scale flows .",
    "it takes much less computer time and yet provide valuable information of the dynamics of the fluid flow .    in this paper",
    "we study the effect of uniform horizontal magnetic field applied along a fixed horizontal direction ( @xmath8-axis ) using a low dimensional model . in the absence of magnetic field",
    "the model shows the onset of convection in the form of steady two dimensional rolls ( 2-d ) .",
    "the 2-d rolls become three dimensional ( 3-d ) via wavy roll instability  @xcite , when the rayleigh number @xmath0 is raised slightly above critical value @xmath1 .",
    "the wavy rolls become chaotic , if @xmath0 is raised about @xmath9 above @xmath1 for low values of prandtl number @xmath2 .",
    "these rolls may be aligned either along @xmath10-axis or along @xmath8-axis .",
    "two sets of rolls compete with each other with further increase in @xmath0 .",
    "the horizontal magnetic field does not shift the threshold of the primary instability ( stationary convection ) .",
    "however , it delays the onset of the secondary instability in the form of wavy rolls .",
    "if chandrasekhar s number @xmath4 , which is proportional to the square of the applied horizontal magnetic field @xmath11 , is raised above certain value , the rolls are oriented along the direction of the magnetic field in the horizontal plane .",
    "the dimensionless number @xmath5 scales with @xmath4 as @xmath6 at the onset of wavy instability .",
    "if the intensity of the magnetic field is sufficient , it suppresses chaotic flow and makes the convection periodic for relatively higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "a stronger magnetic field suppresses the oscillatory convection even at higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "the flow becomes steady and two dimensional in the presence of stronger horizontal magnetic field .",
    "the results of the model are also compared with those observed in experiments  @xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we describe the physical system together with boundary conditions . section iii deals with the derivation of the low - dimensional model .",
    "the results of the model and their comparison with experimental and numerical simulations are described in section iv .",
    "conclusions are given in section v.",
    "as a physical system , a thin horizontal layer of electrically conducting fluid of thickness @xmath12 , uniform kinematic viscosity @xmath13 , thermal diffusivity @xmath14 , magnetic diffusivity @xmath15 and coefficient of volume expansion @xmath16 is kept between two horizontal plates , and is heated uniformly from below . a uniform horizontal magnetic field @xmath17 is applied along a fixed direction ( say along @xmath8-axis ) .",
    "note that we have taken @xmath10 and @xmath8-axes along horizontal directions and @xmath18-axis along vertical upward direction .",
    "we consider the flow of liquid metals which have magnetic prandtl number , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) of the order of @xmath21  @xcite .",

    "the dimensionless parameters are : rayleigh number @xmath38 , thermal prandtl number @xmath39 and chandrasekhar s number @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the acceleration due to gravity and @xmath42 is the reference density of the fluid .",
    "@xmath43 is a unit vector directed vertically upward and @xmath44 is the horizontal laplacian .",
    "we assume the horizontal boundaries to be stress - free , thermally and electrically good conductors .",

    "we then derive the model by projecting the hydrodynamical equations  ( [ motion]-[continuity ] ) on the above mentioned modes .",
    "the model , given in the appendix , consists of twelve dimensional coupled first - order nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the above fourier amplitudes .",

    ", the secondary instability appears as wavy rolls  @xcite as @xmath47 is raised above @xmath55 . with little further increase in @xmath47",
    ", we find chaotically oscillating wavy rolls either oriented along @xmath8-axis or along @xmath10-axis depending upon the choice of initial conditions .",
    "these wavy rolls are observed for @xmath56 for @xmath57 . for @xmath58",
    ", the model shows chaotic competition of rolls and squares  @xcite . in the next subsections we present the results of the model on the effects of magnetic field on the onset of wavy roll instability and chaotic flows .",
    "the convection generated magnetic field adds a term @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 only in the dimensionless navier - stokes equation , where @xmath60 denotes the inverse of laplacian .",
    "this term represents some kind of anisotropic viscosity  @xcite .",
    "therefore it inhibits velocity variations along the magnetic field direction . as a result , the magnetic field inhibits the onset of oscillatory instability and greatly enhances the stationary 2-d convection regime .",
    "it is observed that the onset of oscillatory instability depends both on @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "[ ro_q](a ) clearly shows how the stability boundary of the 2-d convection regime pushed towards higher values of @xmath47 due to the application of uniform magnetic field in horizontal plane .",
    "this result corroborates the experimental  @xcite as well as numerical  @xcite results .",
    "the threshold for wavy instability depends on prandtl number @xmath2 as well as chandrasekhar s number @xmath4 .",
    "the combination of dimensionless numbers @xmath62 shows power law behaviour ( see fig.[ro_q](b ) ) , and scales with @xmath4 as @xmath6 .",
    "we have also displayed the behaviour of the relative distance from the threshold of oscillatory instability @xmath63 in figure  [ scaling](a ) and the angular frequency @xmath64 at the onset of oscillatory instability in figure  [ scaling](b ) as a function of @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 are the threshold values of oscillatory ( secondary ) convection in the presence of the external magnetic field ( @xmath67 ) and in the absence of external magnetic field(@xmath68 ) respectively .",
    "the results of our model is in good agreement with the numerical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite results showing the power law .",
    "the quantity @xmath63 scales with @xmath4 as @xmath69 with @xmath70 , while the experiments and direct numerical simulations gave @xmath71 .",

    "figure  [ chaos_sq_q ] shows the effect of horizontal magnetic field on the orientation of the convective rolls .",
    "fourier modes @xmath72 ( blue curve ) and @xmath73 ( green curve ) oscillate chaotically in the absence of the external magnetic field .",
    "figure  [ chaos_sq_q](a ) shows chaotic wavy rolls along @xmath10-axis for @xmath74 in the absence of external magnetic field ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the set of wavy rolls initially along @xmath10-axis orient themselves along the direction of the magnetic field ( see , figure  [ chaos_sq_q](b ) ) for @xmath76 . for slightly higher values of the reduced rayleigh number ( @xmath77 )",
    ", the model shows competition between mutually perpendicular sets of wavy rolls ( fig .",
    "[ chaos_sq_q](c ) ) in the absence of external magnetic field ( @xmath75 ) in stead of one set of wavy rolls ( fig .",
    "[ chaos_sq_q](a ) ) .",
    "however , the set of wavy rolls along @xmath10-axis disappears and only the rolls along @xmath8-axis survive ( see fig .",
    "[ chaos_sq_q](d ) ) for @xmath78 .",
    "we conclude that the external magnetic field orients the wavy rolls along its own direction .",
    "as mentioned above , in the absence of magnetic field the model shows three types of chaotic patterns : chaotic wavy rolls along @xmath8-axis , chaotic wavy rolls along @xmath10-axis and a competition of mutually perpendicular sets of chaotic wavy rolls depending upon the choice of initial conditions and the value of @xmath47 .",
    "the external uniform horizontal magnetic field of moderate strength applied along @xmath8-axis orients the rolls along its own direction , if it is not already oriented along the magnetic field ( see , figure .  [ chaos_sq_q ] ) .",
    "once the roll - patterns are oriented along the field direction , the effect of further increase of magnetic field is similar to its effect on a roll - patterns already oriented along @xmath8-axis .",
    "figure  [ y_roll](a ) displays the time series of the fourier modes @xmath72 ( blue ) and @xmath73 ( green ) in the absence of magnetic field ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "this represents chaotic wavy rolls along @xmath8-axis .",
    "if the external magnetic field along @xmath8-axis is gradually increased to a large value , chaotic flow is suppressed and a periodic flow develops .",
    "the time series of the fourier mode @xmath72 corresponding to the periodic flow is displayed in figure  [ y_roll](b ) .",
    "further increase in the field strength makes the amplitude of oscillation of the mode @xmath72 smaller ( see , figure  [ y_roll](c ) ) .",
    "the flow becomes stationary and two - dimensional ( 2-d ) as field strength is increased more .",
    "figure  [ y_roll](d ) shows the time series of @xmath72 corresponding to 2-d stationary solution .",
    "the mechanism of the suppression of chaos and reorientation of wavy rolls in the direction of the external magnetic field ( @xmath8-axis ) is displayed very clearly in figure  [ pattern ] .",
    "it displays the isotherms at @xmath79 computed from the model for different values @xmath47 and @xmath4 .",
    "the top row shows the various convective patterns in the absence of magnetic field ( @xmath75 ) : ( a ) chaotic square patterns ( @xmath80 ) , ( b ) chaotic wavy rolls along @xmath8-axis ( @xmath74 ) and ( c ) chaotic wavy rolls along @xmath10-axis ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the effect of increasing magnetic field on different patterns are shown in three columns of figure  [ pattern ] .",
    "as @xmath4 increases , the wavy rolls orient themselves along the direction of the horizontal magnetic field . the chaos is suppressed for relatively higher values of @xmath4 and the flow becomes steady and two dimensional for further higher values of @xmath4 .",
    "the route to chaotic flow from stationary convective motion is displayed in figure  [ route_to_chaos ] .",
    "as chandrasekhar s number @xmath4 is decreased from higher to lower value , the system shows a series of bifurcations . for much higher values of @xmath4",
    "the convection is stationary in the form of 2-d rolls along the direction of the magnetic field . with further decrease in @xmath4 ,",
    "there is a hopf bifurcation from stationary state .",
    "the convective flow shows time periodic behaviour ( figure  [ route_to_chaos]a - b ) .",
    "as @xmath4 is lowered below certain value of @xmath4 , one more independent frequency develops in the flow .",
    "consequently , the convection becomes quasi - periodic in time ( figure  [ route_to_chaos]c - d ) .",
    "further decrease of @xmath4 leads to chaotic motion ( figure  [ route_to_chaos]e - f ) .",
    "the route to chaos is via temporal quasi - periodic convection .",
    "the chaotic motion becomes more complicated with further decrease in @xmath4 ( see figure  [ route_to_chaos]g - h ) .",
    "the amplitude and frequency of oscillatory convection due to hopf bifurcation , as @xmath4 is lowered from higher to lower values for a fixed value of @xmath47 , are displayed in figure  [ fre_amp ] .",
    "the dimensionless frequency decreases linearly with the decrease in @xmath4  ( figure  [ fre_amp]a ) .",
    "the square of the amplitude of the oscillatory motion increases linearly with the decrease in @xmath4 near the onset of hopf bifurcation  ( figure  [ fre_amp]b ) .",
    "however , the square of the amplitude starts increasing slower than linear with decrease in @xmath4 away from the onset of oscillatory behaviour .",
    "ultimately , its growth is stopped and it starts decreasing with decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "this may be the influence of quasi - periodic bifurcation present in the model .",
    "we have also plotted the nusselt number obtained from the model as a function of rayleigh number @xmath0 in figure  [ nusselt ] .",
    "the time averaged nusselt number at the onset of convection has strong similarity with the behaviour of nusselt number computed in the direct numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the results of the model also show the convergence of nusselt numbers for higher values of @xmath0 as observed in simulation  @xcite for various values of @xmath4 . for intermediate values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the nusselt number obtained from the model shows differences with the same obtained in dns .",
    "this may be due to severe truncation of the fourier expansion of various fields in the model .",
    "in this paper we presented a low - dimensional model to study the effect of uniform horizontal magnetic field on rayleigh - bnard convection in low - prandtl - number fluids .",
    "the model is capable of capturing convective patterns in the form of two sets of mutually perpendicular straight ( 2-d ) rolls as well wavy ( 3-d ) rolls .",
    "the external field affects the flow patterns significantly .",
    "it inhibits the onset of wavy rolls , which appear at the secondary instability .",
    "the stationary straight rolls at primary instability as well as wavy rolls at secondary instability orient themselves along the direction of the magnetic field , if it is sufficiently strong .",
    "the threshold value of the rayleigh number at the onset of wavy instability shows power law behaviour .",
    "stronger magnetic field causes the suppression of chaotic flow .",
    "the results obtained from this simple model have good qualitative agreement with those observed in experiments and simulations .",
