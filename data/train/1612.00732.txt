    "the infection by human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) continues to be a major global public health issue , having claimed more than 34 million lives so far @xcite .",
    "the most advanced stage of hiv infection is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) .",
    "there is yet no cure or vaccine to aids .",
    "however , antiretroviral ( art ) treatment improves health , prolongs life , and substantially reduces the risk of hiv transmission . in both high - income and low - income countries , the life expectancy of patients infected with hiv who have access to art is now measured in decades , and might approach that of uninfected populations in patients who receive an optimum treatment ( see @xcite and references cited therein )",
    "however , art treatment still presents substantial limitations : does not fully restore health ; treatment is associated with side effects ; the medications are expensive ; and is not curative . according to the joint united nations programme on hiv and aids ( unaids ) , the main advocate for accelerated , comprehensive and coordinated global action on the hiv / aids epidemic , the number of people living with hiv continues to increase , in large part because more people are accessing art therapy globally . in 2015 , 15.8 million people were accessing treatment .",
    "new hiv infections have fallen by 35% since 2000 and aids - related deaths have fallen by 42% since the peak in 2004 . in 2000 , fewer than 1% of people living with hiv in low- and middle - income countries had access to treatment . in 2014 ,",
    "the global coverage of people receiving art therapy was 40% .",
    "however , in 2014 , around 2 million people were newly infected with hiv and 1.2 million people died of aids - related illnesses .",
    "of the 36.9 million people living with hiv globally in 2014 , 17.1 million did not know they had the virus and were not aware of the need to be reached with hiv testing services . around 22 million do not had access to hiv treatment , including 1.8 million children @xcite .",
    "cape verde is an island country spanning an archipelago of 10 volcanic islands in the central atlantic ocean .",
    "located 570 kilometres ( 350 miles ) off the coast of western africa , the islands cover a combined area of slightly over 4,000 square kilometres ( 1,500 square miles ) .",
    "since the early 1990s , cape verde has been a stable representative democracy , and remains one of the most developed and democratic countries in africa .",
    "its population is of around 506,000 residents with a sizeable diaspora community across all the world , outnumbering the inhabitants on the islands .",
    "such facts make cape verde an important case study , with global implications @xcite .    in 2014 , 409 new hiv cases were reported in cape verde , accumulating a total of 4,946 cases . of this total",
    ", 1,766 developed aids and 1,066 have died .",
    "the municipality with more cases was praia , followed by santa catarina ( santiago island ) and so vicente .",
    "cape verde has developed a strategic national plan to fight against aids , which includes art treatment , monitoring of patients , prevention actions and hiv testing . from the first diagnosis of aids in 1986 ,",
    "cape verde got significant progress in the fight , prevention and treatment of hiv / aids @xcite .",
    "mathematical models , based on the underlying transmission mechanism of the hiv , can help the medical and scientific community to understand and anticipate its spread in different populations and evaluate the potential effectiveness of different approaches for bringing the epidemic under control @xcite .",
    "several mathematical models have been proposed for hiv / aids transmission dynamics : see , e.g. , and references cited therein .    in this paper , based on @xcite ,",
    "we propose and analyse a mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of hiv and aids .",
    "our aim is to show that a simpler mathematical model than the one of @xcite can help to clarify some of the essential relations between epidemiological factors and the overall pattern of the aids epidemic , as it was stated in @xcite .",
    "our model considers art treatment of hiv - infected individuals with and without aids symptoms .",
    "the hiv - infected individuals with no aids symptoms that start art treatment move into the class of individuals that respect carefully art treatment and stay in what we call a _ chronic _ stage of the infection .",
    "we assume that individuals in the chronic class have the same expectancy of life as non hiv infected individuals .",
    "our model is then calibrated to the cumulative cases of infection by hiv and aids in cape verde , from 1987 to 2014 , as reported in @xcite .",
    "we show that our model predicts well such reality . a sensitivity analysis",
    "is then carried out , for some of the model parameters , and some conclusions for cape verde and worldwide inferred .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is formulated and analysed in section  [ sec : sica : model ] . in section  [ sec : global : stab ] , we prove the global stability of the unique endemic equilibrium whenever the basic reproduction number is greater than one . in section  [ sec : sensitivity ] , we do a sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : model : capeverde ] we apply our model to hiv / aids cape verde infection data from the period of 1987 to 2014 and some conclusions are derived in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we propose and analyse a mathematical model for hiv / aids transmission with varying population size in a homogeneously mixing population .",
    "the model is based on that of @xcite and subdivides the human population into four mutually - exclusive compartments : susceptible individuals ( @xmath0 ) ; hiv - infected individuals with no clinical symptoms of aids ( the virus is living or developing in the individuals but without producing symptoms or only mild ones ) but able to transmit hiv to other individuals ( @xmath1 ) ; hiv - infected individuals under art treatment ( the so called chronic stage ) with a viral load remaining low ( @xmath2 ) ; and hiv - infected individuals with aids clinical symptoms ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the total population at time @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath5 , is given by @xmath6 the susceptible population is increased by the recruitment of individuals into the population , assumed susceptible , at a rate @xmath7 .",
    "all individuals suffer from natural death , at a constant rate @xmath8 .",
    "although individuals in the chronic stage , with a low viral load and under art treatment , can still transmit hiv infection , as art greatly reduces the risk of transmission and individuals that take art treatment correctly are aware of their health status , we assume that individuals in the class @xmath2 do not have risky behaviours for hiv transmission and do not transmit hiv virus .",
    "we also assume that individuals with aids clinical symptoms @xmath3 are responsible and do not have any behaviour that can transmit hiv infection or , in other cases , are too sick to have a risky behaviour . based on these two assumptions ,",
    "susceptible individuals acquire hiv infection by following effective contact with individuals in the class @xmath1 at a rate @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the effective contact rate for hiv transmission .",
    "we assume that hiv - infected individuals with and without aids symptoms have access to art treatment .",
    "hiv - infected individuals with no aids symptoms @xmath1 progress to the class of individuals with hiv infection under art treatment @xmath2 at a rate @xmath11 , and hiv - infected individuals with aids symptoms are treated for hiv at rate @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that an hiv - infected individual with aids symptoms @xmath3 that starts treatment moves to the class of hiv - infected individuals @xmath1 and he will move to the chronic class @xmath2 only if the treatment is maintained .",

    "we assume that only hiv - infected individuals with aids symptoms @xmath3 suffer from an aids induced death , at a rate @xmath14 .",
    "these assumptions are translated in the following mathematical model : @xmath15 \\dot{i}(t ) = \\beta \\frac{i(t)}{n(t ) } s(t ) - ( \\rho + \\phi + \\mu)i(t ) + \\alpha a(t )   + \\omega c(t ) , \\\\[0.2 cm ] \\dot{c}(t ) = \\phi i(t ) - ( \\omega + \\mu)c(t),\\\\[0.2 cm ] \\dot{a}(t ) =   \\rho \\ , i(t ) - ( \\alpha + \\mu + d ) a(t )",

    "the model is epidemiologically and mathematically well posed in the sense of @xcite .",

    "therefore , the treatment of hiv - infected individuals with no symptoms of aids , @xmath1 , has always a positive impact in reducing the hiv burden .",
    "on the other hand , the treatment of hiv - infected individuals increases the number of hiv - infected individuals , explained because when they start art treatment their expectancy of life increases and there will be more people living with hiv - infection with no aids symptoms .",
