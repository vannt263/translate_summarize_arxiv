    "new technological advances in physico - chemical manipulation of colloidal mixtures have brought up again the issue of theoretically understanding the phase behaviour of polydisperse systems @xcite .",
    "` polydispersity ' in colloidal solutions means that , due to their production process , suspended macroparticles with the same chemical composition can not be exactly identical to each other , but in general have different sizes , and possibly different surface charges , shapes , etc . in practice",
    ", a polydisperse system can be reckoned as a mixture with very large  or essentially infinite ",
    "number @xmath3 of different species or components , identified by one or several parameters ( @xmath3 large but finite refers to _ discrete polydispersity _ , whereas @xmath4 with a continuous distribution of polydisperse parameters corresponds to _ continuous polydispersity _ ) .",
    "the present paper will consider discrete polydispersity of spherical colloidal particles , with their diameter being the only polydisperse attribute ( size - polydispersity ) .",
    "when polydispersity is not negligible , the phase behaviour becomes much richer , but the determination of phase transition boundaries requires a much more involved formalism , compared to the monodisperse counterpart .",
    "in fact , the coexistence condition in terms of intensive variables requires that all phases must have equal temperature , pressure and chemical potentials of the @xmath5 components . in the presence of polydispersity",
    ", one should thus solve a number of equations of the order of @xmath6 , a task which is practically impossible for @xmath3 large or infinite .",
    "however , the study of phase equilibria can conveniently start from the appropriate thermodynamic potential , which is the helmholtz free energy @xmath7 when the experimentally controlled variables are temperature , volume and numbers of different colloidal species . in the one - component case",
    ", the coexistence condition of equal pressure and chemical potential has a simple geometrical interpretation in terms of free energy density @xmath8 : the densities of two coexisting phases are determined by constructing a double - tangent to @xmath8 plotted versus particle density .",
    "this recipe leads to the well known maxwell construction , which connects suitably selected points along a van der waals ( vdw ) subcritical isotherm , in order to reduce its unphysical loop to a constant - pressure line characteristic of a first - order phase transition .    in the polydisperse case",
    ", a significant progress in the very difficult problem of predicting phase equilibria can be obtained for models with _ truncatable _",
    "free energies @xcite . here ` truncatable ' means that the excess free energy of the polydisperse system turns out to depend only on a _ finite _ number of moments of the distribution corresponding to the polydisperse attribute ( the diameter @xmath9 in the simplest cases ) . for spherical colloids ,",
    "the excess free energy of the vdw model extended to polydisperse fluids has such a truncatable structure . due to this property , this vdw theory has often been employed as the simplest model to investigate the effects of polydispersity on the gas - liquid transition @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the influence of polydispersity on freezing has been addressed by using the hard - sphere ( hs ) mixture model , which also admits a truncatable free energy @xcite ( for the fluid phase , the boublik - mansoori - carnahan - starling - leland ( bmcsl ) @xcite expression was employed ) .",
    "it is worth recalling that it is currently believed that size - polydispersity might destabilize crystallization , eventually inhibiting freezing above a certain ` terminal ' value of polydispersity sollich02 .",
    "the present paper focuses on  and reviews  a number of recent attempts to investigate polydisperse phase equilibria , at least within some approximations , for another prototype model useful for studying colloidal suspensions , namely baxter s sticky - hard - spheres ( shs ) @xcite . here",
    "the particles are hard spheres with a surface adhesion , and the corresponding potential can be obtained as a limit of an attractive square - well which becomes infinitely deep and narrow , according to a particular prescription which ensures a finite non - zero contribution of adhesion to the second virial coefficient ( ` sticky limit ' ) . for the one - component version of this model , baxter and collaborators",
    "@xcite solved the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) integral equation coupled with the percus - yevick ( py ) approximation ( ` closure ' ) .",
    "this _ fully analytical _ solution allows to determine all structural and thermodynamical properties of the shs fluid . on the other hand ,",
    "the multi - component py solution , which soon followed baxter s work @xcite , is practically inapplicable in the presence of significant polydispersity .",
    "in fact , it requires the computation of a set of parameters @xmath10 determined by a system of @xmath11 quadratic equations , which  in general  can not be solved even numerically for a mixture with a large number of components .",
    "moreover , even in the presence of a general solution for this non - linear algebraic system , the problem of phase coexistence would still remain out of reach in view of the previous remarks .    in a series of recent papers gazzillo00,gazzillo02,gazzillo03,fantoni05,fantoni06,gazzillo06",
    ", we have attempted to make some progress along two different lines .",
    "first , starting from the _ density _ expansion of the cavity function at contact , we have considered a sequence of simpler approximations ( compared to the py one ) gazzillo00,gazzillo02,gazzillo03,gazzillo04,fantoni05 . within the two simplest ones among these approximations , denoted as @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( for reasons which will become clear in the following ) , we have been able to derive analytically all relevant information regarding structure and thermodynamics , including the phase coexistence , in view of the fact that the corresponding free energy turns out to be truncatable @xcite .",
    "due to the simplicity of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , it is however reasonable to expect these approximations to fail at high packing fractions , with a consequently incomplete or even incorrect description of the effects of polydispersity on the phase diagram .",
    "therefore , in collaboration with peter sollich , we have recently explored a second approach @xcite , where the expansion variable ( which must be small ) is an appropriate polydispersity index .",
    "in such a way , we have tried to solve the non - linear algebraic system  involved in the py result  _ perturbatively in polydispersity _ , starting from the monodisperse py solution .",
    "the shs model is defined as limiting case of  a particular square - well ( sw ) model @xcite , based upon a potential including steeply repulsive core and short - ranged attractive tail , i.e.    @xmath12    with@xmath13where @xmath14 is the hs diameter of species @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the depth and the width of the well , respectively , @xmath18 denotes boltzmann s constant , @xmath19 the temperature .",
    "moreover , @xmath20where the conventional baxter parameter @xmath21 is an unspecified increasing function of @xmath19 , while @xmath22 measures the strength of surface adhesion or ` stickiness ' between particles of species @xmath15 and @xmath23 .",
    "the ` sticky limit ' of @xmath24 corresponds to taking @xmath25 . while the sw width goes to zero ,",
    "its depth @xmath26 diverges , giving rise to a dirac delta function in the boltzmann factor @xcite , i. e.@xmath27where @xmath28 , while @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the heaviside step function and the dirac delta function , respectively .",
    "the advantage of the sticky limit is that one effectively deals with a single parameter @xmath21 for each pair , rather than a combination of energy and length scales ( as occurs in the square - well model , for which no analytical solution is known ) . on the one hand , this particular limit has the disadvantage of introducing some pathologies in the model , notably in the one - component case @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "baxter s model represents the simplest paradigmatic example of a combination of steep repulsion and short - range attraction which entails a complete analytical solution in the one - component case , within a robust approximation such as the py closure .      as a consequence , although the py closure is commonly believed to be very sound for short - range potentials ( for one - component shs fluids this was confirmed by recent numerical simulations @xcite ) , one has to conclude that , in the multi - component ( polydisperse ) case , the py solution has a very limited practical usefulness , since its solution scheme can not be fully accomplished .",
    "this is the reason why other possible routes have been attempted , as we discuss next .",
    "a ` closure ' is a relationship , added to the oz equation , between the direct correlation function @xmath46 and @xmath47 or @xmath48 ( @xmath49 being the radial distribution function ) @xcite .",
    "let us go back to baxter s sw model given by eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) ( i.e. _ before _ the ` sticky limit ' ) , and consider the following general class of ` closures ' @xcite @xmath50the expression @xmath51 inside the core ( @xmath52 ) is exact and dictated by the hs potential .",
    "the form outside the well ( @xmath53 ) may then be identified with the py approximation , @xmath54 , \\]]since , for baxter s potential , the mayer function , @xmath55 -1 $ ] , vanishes for @xmath53 .",
    "the choice of @xmath56 inside the well ( region which shrinks in the sticky limit ) defines one particular closure within the proposed class .",
    "of course , @xmath57 corresponds to the py approximation . on the other hand , when @xmath58 , we are in the presence of _ mixed closures , _ which have frequently appeared in the literature @xcite . in order to define mixed closures simpler than the py approximation , we consider the _ density _ expansion of the exact direct correlation function @xcite , and denote as @xmath0 approximation a truncation of this series to order @xmath59 .",
    "the simplest two approximations are    @xmath60   &   &   \\text{(}c_{1}\\text { closure),}% \\end{array}%\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 is the number density of species @xmath62 , while @xmath63 denotes convolutive integration @xcite .    in the ` sticky limit '",
    "@xmath64 the well region shrinks , but a ` memory ' of the approximation chosen for @xmath65 remains in the solution of the oz integral equation .",
    "in fact , although all solutions @xmath66 corresponding to closures belonging to the class given by eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) have the same functional form as the py solution  eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] )  , each closure is characterized by its own approximation to @xmath35 , which is involved in the expressions of the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath67 .",
    "for instance , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 approximations correspond to    @xmath68    which are , respectively , the zeroth and first  order truncations of the density expansion for the exact cavity function at contact ( see ref .",
    "gazzillo04 for details ) .",
    "while a brute - force truncation of the above - mentioned density expansions leads to analytical expressions simple enough to be applied to the multi - component ( polydisperse ) case , one should reasonably expect less accuracy , expecially in the high - density regime . in the one - component case",
    ", we can carefully check this point .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "coexistence curves obtained from the @xmath69 and @xmath2 approximations are compared with the py ones ( using both compressibility and energy routes ) , and with monte carlo simulations from ref .",
    "it is apparent how the py energy route ( pye ) yields a rather precise representation of the mc results , unlike the compressibility route ( pyc ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the results stemming from the @xmath2 approximation , although rather close to the mc data in the low - density branch , clearly fail to accurately reproduce them for higher densities , as expected .    in spite of their lack of accuracy , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 approximations provide however a rather sound basis for getting some insight into phase equilibria of polydisperse shs fluids , since they allow simple analytical , or semi - analytical , treatments .",
    "a first important feature of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 approximations for polydisperse shs is that the corresponding free energy has a _ truncatable _ structure , that is it depends upon few ( @xmath70 at most ) moments of the ( discrete ) size distribution , @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "a second remarkable fact is that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 approximations are able to describe the so - called _ fractionation _ phenomena characteristic in phase equilibria of polydisperse systems .",
    "while we refer to a recent review @xcite for detailed description of the increased complexity in the polydisperse phase diagrams , here we just mention the two important points .",
    "first , fractionation means that daughter phases , obtained from demixing of a parent homogeneous phase , need not have the same composition of the parent phase . as a consequence",
    ", there is no a single coexistence line ( ` binodal ' ) as in the one - component case , but one rather finds a _ cloud curve _ , representing the temperature - density dependence line of the low - density majority phase ( gas ) , and a _ shadow curve _ representing the temperature - density dependence of the high - density minority phase ( incipient liquid ) . while for one - component systems these two curves are identical , for polydisperse systems in general they are not , with the exception of the critical point where they coincide by definition .",
    "however , in order to apply the @xmath1 and @xmath2 approximations to the multi - component shs model , we have to tackle a further important problem , that is the definition of the stickiness parameters @xmath21 .",
    "in mixtures , @xmath21 will depend on the particular pair @xmath73 considered , and reasonably should be expected to be related to the particles sizes . assuming that we are dealing only with size - polydispersity , we can always decouple temperature and adhesion as @xmath74where the last equality stems from the assumption of size - polydispersity and of a purely pairwise potential .",
    "unfortunately , the exact form of the size - dependence of these stickiness parameters is still an open problem , due to the lack of experimental and theoretical insights on this @xcite . on the other hand , few guidelines  based on arguments discussed in refs .",
    "provide , as reasonable and plausible , the following dependences @xmath75here @xmath76 is a characteristic reference length ( e.g. the parental mean diameter ) and the numbering of the various cases follows the convention of previous work @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] reports the results of the calculation of the cloud and shadow curves for polydisperse shs within the simple @xmath1 approximation . here and below",
    ", polydispersity is measured by an index @xmath77 , which is the normalized standard deviation of the size distribution .",
    "hence @xmath78 corresponds to a mono - disperse case , whereas @xmath79 and @xmath80 indicate moderate and significant polydispersity , respectively .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] depicts the results for case i of size - dependence of stickiness parameters . as @xmath77 increases",
    ", the coexistence region shrinks , thus suggesting that polydispersity _ disfavours _ the phase transition . on the other hand ,",
    "this trend is markedly case - dependent , as illustrated in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the cloud - shadow pairs with polydispersity @xmath80 are displayed for different cases of size - dependence .",
    "it can be clearly seen that while , for cases i and v the same trend is observed , case iv seems to suggest a _ widening _ of the phase coexistence region ( and hence a favouring of the phase transition ) .    in view of the lack of numerical simulation for polydisperse shs to compare with , we have no way , at the present stage , to check how realistic those results are .",
    "on the other hand , we might suspect , based on the comparison in the one - component case , @xmath1 to fail to provide accurate representation in the region of low temperatures and high densities .",
    "this is the reason why other possible approaches have been recently tested .",
    "we now illustrate a different perturbative approach , which has proved to be promising in this context .",
    "the main difficulty in dealing with the py solution for polydisperse shs stems from the solution of the coupled quadratic system of equations ( eq4 ) , as remarked . as the one - component case has a well - defined solution",
    ", one might then suspect that  for weak polydispersity ",
    "a perturbative expansion around this solution might include the main effects of polydispersity .",
    "this is in fact what happens , as recently shown fantoni06 by exploiting a general perturbation theory due to evans evans01 .",
    "the main idea is that , for weak polydispersity , size - distributions are narrowly peaked around a mean reference value ( @xmath81 in the present case ) , and hence all quantities such as@xmath82are small .",
    "therefore one might expand both @xmath83 and all quantities appearing in @xmath84 in powers of @xmath85 .",
    "similar expansion can be performed in the free energy , and hence all thermodynamic quantities can be computed .",
    "the entire procedure is described in detail in refs .",
    "here we just summarize the main results .",
    "the approximate range of validity of the perturbation expansion can be envisaged by considering the polydisperse hs case where the ` exact ' bmcsl approximation @xcite can be compared with the corresponding perturbative solution based on the one - component ( @xmath78 ) counterpart .",
    "this is reported in the top - left part of figure [ fig3 ] , where the quantity @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) is plotted against the packing fraction @xmath88 for increasing values of polydispersity .",
    "it is apparent how the perturbative solution remains rather close to the exact polydisperse bmcsl solution even for moderate polydispersity @xmath89 , which is the maximum value considered in the remaining part of the work .",
    "the remaining plots in figure [ fig3 ] display the effect of polydispersity on the py pressure equation of state as obtained from the energy route and for decreasing values of the temperature @xmath90 . in the one component case",
    "@xmath78 , a van der waals loop starts to appear when we cross the critical temperature @xmath91 coming from the high @xmath90 regime .",
    "obviously this signals the onset of a liquid - gas phase transition , and the corresponding phase diagram can be obtained by a standard maxwell construction by connecting appropriate points with the same pressure . in the presence of polydispersity",
    "( here represented by choice iv for size - dependence of the stickiness parameters ) the same procedure _ can not _ be applied due to fractionation , as already discussed .",
    "nevertheless , we can clearly see that as @xmath77 increases , the van der waals loop region ( when present ) expands , thus suggesting that phase transition is favored by the presence of polydispersity .",
    "a similar feature occurs for the polydisperse van der waals model @xcite and for the numerical results of the py compressibility equation of state @xcite ( note that in the latter a _ gap _ rather that a _ loop _ is signalling the onset of the transition ) .",
    "a somewhat surprising feature is that , at fixed packing fraction @xmath88 , the pressure decreases with increasing polydispersity _",
    "less _ in the presence of adhesion rather than in its absence ( i.e. for the hs case ) .",
    "an intuitive plausible interpretation of this feature can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the same perturbative approach allows the determination of the cloud and shadow curves for the various cases of size - dependence of @xmath92 .",
    "this is reported in figure [ fig4 ] for cases ii , iv ( top panel ) and i , v ( bottom panel ) . in the first case the cloud and shadow lines collapse into a single curve , and",
    "this can be understood on the basis of the particular scaling properties of the free energy to this order in perturbation theory @xcite . in all cases there",
    "is a breakdown of the perturbation theory on approaching the critical point , and this is a known general drawback of evans perturbative scheme .",
    "nevertheless , in all cases and to this order in perturbation theory , there is a tendency of the phase coexistence region to _ increase _ with polydispersity , in qualitative agreement with the intuitive picture obtained from figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "it is worth stressing the difference with previous non - perturbative results stemming from the @xmath1 solution , where all different cases ( with the notable exception of iv ) were predicting a reduction of the phase coexistence region .",
    "while in the @xmath1 description we have provided a careful treatment of polydispersity at the expenses of accuracy of the exploited approximation , in the perturbative description of the py solution , polydispersity is assumed to be small and hence one might suspect that solutions with large polydispersities can not fit within this picture . on a balance , nevertheless , we would favour the latter rather than the former description .",
    "an almost correct representation of the one - component counterpart , is a necessary requirement to check the effect of polydispersity on it , and we are not aware of any physical or experimental system where the effects of polydispersity are so strong that they could not kept into account , at least at the simplest qualitative level , by the perturbative scheme proposed here . along this line , some further proposals have been put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite to derive a phenomenological bmcsl - like approximation for shs , which might be regarded as our best and simplest guess to the _ exact _ phase behavior of polydisperse shs . even on the size - dependence of @xmath22",
    "some possible support of the proposed forms may be argued @xcite .",
    "in this work we have summarized recent advances in predicting theoretically the phase diagram for polydisperse suspensions of colloidal particles with surface adhesion , within the simple description of baxter s model .",
    "emphasis was put on the crucial  unsolved ",
    "step required to get the multi - component shs - py solution , and the proposed recipies to deal with this problem .",
    "this first one is based on a simplification of the closure .",
    "it has the advantage of allowing a complete analytical analysis on the effects of polydispersity , including fractionation , but has the disadvantage of a very questionable accuracy .",
    "the second one is based on a perturbative method , starting from the energy py one - component solution , which is known to provide an accurate description of the phase diagram .",
    "the drawback of this scheme is that it works for mild polydispersity , and that can not describe the changes of the critical point region .",
    "notwithstanding these limitations , this novel approach is expected to find practical application in the interpretation of all those phenomena where baxter s model and polydispersity both play a privileged role .",
