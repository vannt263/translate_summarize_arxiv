    "recently , a power - counting renormalizable , ultra - violet ( uv ) complete theory of gravity was proposed by hoava in @xcite . although presenting an infrared ( ir ) fixed point , namely general relativity , in the uv the theory possesses a fixed point with an anisotropic , lifshitz scaling between time and space .",
    "due to these novel features , there has been a large amount of effort in examining and extending the properties of the theory itself @xcite .",
    "additionally , application of hoava - lifshitz gravity as a cosmological framework gives rise to hoava - lifshitz cosmology , which proves to lead to interesting behavior @xcite .",
    "in particular , one can examine specific solution subclasses @xcite , the phase - space behavior @xcite , the gravitational wave production @xcite , the perturbation spectrum @xcite , the matter bounce @xcite , the black hole properties @xcite , the dark energy phenomenology @xcite , the astrophysical phenomenology @xcite , the thermodynamic properties @xcite etc .",
    "however , despite this extended research , there are still many ambiguities if hoava - lifshitz gravity is reliable and capable of a successful description of the gravitational background of our world , as well as of the cosmological behavior of the universe @xcite .",
    "although the discussion about the foundations and the possible conceptual and phenomenological problems of hoava - lifshitz gravity and cosmology is still open in the literature , it is worth investigating in a systematic way the constraints imposed by observations in a universe governed by hoava gravity",
    ". thus , in the present work we use big bang nucleosynthesis conditions , together with type ia supernovae ( snia ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data , in order to construct the corresponding probability contour - plots for the parameters of the theory .",
    "furthermore , in order to be general and model - independent , we perform our analysis with and without the detailed - balance condition",
    ". as we will show , both the detailed - balance and beyond - detailed - balance formulations are compatible with observations , however under tight constraints on the model parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we present the basic ingredients of hoava - lifshitz cosmology , extracting the friedmann equations , and describing the dark matter and dark energy dynamics . in section [ observational constraints ]",
    "we constrain both the detailed - balance and the beyond - detailed - balance formulations from the observational point of view .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] is devoted to the summary of the obtained results .",
    "let us present the scenario where the cosmological evolution is governed by hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "the dynamical variables are the lapse and shift functions , @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , and the spatial metric @xmath2 ( roman letters indicate spatial indices ) . in terms of these fields the full metric",
    "is written as : @xmath3 where indices are raised and lowered using @xmath2 .",
    "the scaling transformation of the coordinates reads : @xmath4      the gravitational action is decomposed into a kinetic and a potential part as @xmath5 .",
    "the assumption of detailed balance @xcite reduces the possible terms in the lagrangian , and it allows for a quantum inheritance principle @xcite , since the @xmath6-dimensional theory acquires the renormalization properties of the @xmath7-dimensional one . under the detailed balance condition",
    "the full action of hoava - lifshitz gravity is given by @xmath8 \\right\\ } , \\label{acct}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the extrinsic curvature and @xmath10 the cotton tensor , and the covariant derivatives are defined with respect to the spatial metric @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath11 is the totally antisymmetric unit tensor , @xmath12 is a dimensionless constant and the variables @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constants with mass dimensions @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "finally , we mention that in action ( [ acct ] ) we have performed the usual analytic continuation of the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath14 of the original version of hoava - lifshitz gravity , since such a procedure is required in order to obtain a realistic cosmology @xcite ( although it could fatally affect the gravitational theory itself ) . therefore ,",
    "in the present work @xmath19 is a positive constant , which as usual is related to the cosmological constant in the ir limit .    in",
    "order to add the matter component ( including both dark and baryonic matter ) in the theory one can follow two equivalent approaches .",
    "the first is to introduce a scalar field @xcite and thus attribute to dark matter a dynamical behavior , with its energy density @xmath20 and pressure @xmath21 defined through the field kinetic and potential energy .",
    "although such an approach is theoretically robust , it is not suitable from the phenomenological point of view since it requires special matter - potentials in order to acquire an almost constant matter equation - of - state parameter ( @xmath22 ) as it is suggested by observations . in the second approach one",
    "adds a cosmological stress - energy tensor to the gravitational field equations , by demanding to recover the usual general relativity formulation in the low - energy limit @xcite .",
    "thus , this matter - tensor is a hydrodynamical approximation with @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( or @xmath20 and @xmath23 ) as parameters .",
    "similarly , one can additionally include the standard - model - radiation component ( corresponding to photons and neutrinos ) , with the additional parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( or @xmath24 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "such an approach , although not fundamental , is better for a phenomenological analysis , such the one performed in this work .",
    "now , in order to focus on cosmological frameworks , we impose the so called projectability condition @xcite and use an frw metric , @xmath27 with @xmath28 where @xmath29 corresponding to open , flat , and closed universe respectively ( we have adopted the convention of taking the scale factor @xmath30 to be dimensionless and the curvature constant @xmath31 to have mass dimension 2 ) . by varying @xmath0 and @xmath2 , we obtain the equations of motion : @xmath32-\\nonumber\\\\   & -&\\frac{\\kappa^4\\mu^2\\lambda   k}{8(3\\lambda-1)^2a^2 } \\",
    ", \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath33-\\nonumber\\\\   & -&\\frac{\\kappa^4\\mu^2\\lambda   k}{16(3\\lambda-1)^2a^2}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the hubble parameter as @xmath34 . as usual ,",
    "@xmath20 ( dark plus baryonic matter ) follows the standard evolution equation @xmath35 while @xmath24 ( standard - model radiation ) follows @xmath36    finally , concerning the dark - energy sector we can define @xmath37 @xmath38 the term proportional to @xmath39 is the usual `` dark radiation term '' , present in hoava - lifshitz cosmology @xcite , while the constant term is just the explicit cosmological constant .",
    "therefore , in expressions ( [ rhode]),([pde ] ) we have defined the energy density and pressure for the effective dark energy , which incorporates the aforementioned contributions .",
    "finally , note that using ( [ rhode]),([pde ] ) it is straightforward to see that these dark energy quantities satisfy the standard evolution equation : @xmath40    using the above definitions , we can re - write the friedmann equations ( [ fr1fluid]),([fr2fluid ] ) in the standard form : @xmath41- \\frac{\\kappa^4\\mu^2\\lambda   k}{8(3\\lambda-1)^2a^2}\\ ] ] @xmath42-\\frac{\\kappa^4\\mu^2\\lambda   k}{16(3\\lambda-1)^2a^2}.\\ ] ] therefore , if we require these expressions to coincide with the standard friedmann equations , in units where @xmath43 we set @xcite : @xmath44 with @xmath45 the usual newton s constant .",
    "note that the running of the light speed with @xmath12 , is not a problem , since in this work we will remain in the phenomenologically relevant case of @xmath46 .",
    "the aforementioned formulation of hoava - lifshitz cosmology has been performed under the imposition of the detailed - balance condition .",
    "however , in the literature there is a discussion whether this condition leads to reliable results or if it is able to reveal the full information of hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "therefore , one needs to investigate also the friedmann equations in the case where detailed balance is relaxed .",
    "in such a case one can in general write @xcite : @xmath47+\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\frac{\\sigma_2}{3(3{\\lambda}-1)}\\frac { k}{a^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath48+\\nonumber\\\\&+ &   \\frac{\\sigma_2}{6(3{\\lambda}-1)}\\frac { k}{a^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 , and the constants @xmath50 are arbitrary ( with @xmath51 being negative ) .",
    "note that one could absorb the factor of @xmath52 in redefined parameters , but we prefer to keep it in order to coincide with the notation of @xcite . as we observe , the effect of the detailed - balance relaxation is the decoupling of the coefficients , together with the appearance of a term proportional to @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the corresponding quantities for dark energy are generalized to @xmath54 therefore , it is easy to see that @xmath55 finally , if we force ( [ fr1c]),([fr2c ] ) to coincide with the standard friedmann equations , we result to : @xmath56",
    "having presented the cosmological equations of a universe governed by hoava - lifshitz gravity , both with and without the detailed - balance condition , we now proceed to study the observational constraints on the model parameters .",
    "this is performed in the following two subsections , for the detailed and non - detailed balance scenarios separately .",
    "we mention that since the cosmological observations lie deep inside the ir , in the following we set the running parameter @xmath12 to @xmath18 .",
    "we work in the usual units suitable for observational comparisons , namely setting @xmath57 ( we have already set @xmath43 in order to obtain ( [ simpleconstants0 ] ) ) .",
    "this allows us to reduce the parameter space , since in this case ( [ simpleconstants0 ] ) lead to : @xmath58 inserting these relations into friedmann equation ( [ fr1fluid ] ) we obtain @xmath59 in terms of the usual density parameters ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) this expression becomes : @xmath63 finally , applying this relation at present time and setting the current scale factor @xmath64 we get : @xmath65 where a @xmath17-subscript denotes the present value of the corresponding quantity .",
    "as was mentioned above , we have used the analytic continuation , as a result of which @xmath66 is positive .",
    "thus , relation ( [ fr0detb ] ) can in principle be satisfied by a suitable choice of @xmath66 .",
    "however , note that without the analytic continuation ( and therefore with a negative @xmath66 ) relation ( [ fr0detb ] ) could never be satisfied ( as expected , since in this case the theory would not have the @xmath46 ir , general - relativity limit ) , and this offers another indication , from the phenomenological point of view , for the necessity of the analytic continuation in the detailed - balance version of hoava - lifshitz cosmology .    in order to proceed to the elaboration of observational data , we consider as usual the matter ( dark plus baryonic ) component to be dust , that is @xmath67 , and similarly for the standard - model radiation we consider @xmath68 , where both assumptions are valid in the epochs in which observations focus .",
    "therefore , the corresponding evolution equations ( [ rhodotfluid]),([rhodotfluidrad ] ) give @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "finally , instead of the scale factor it proves convenient to use the redshift @xmath71 as the independent variable , which is given by @xmath72 . inserting these into friedmann equation ( [ friedmandb ] ) we obtain @xmath73 \\big\\ } ,   \\label{frdbfinal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have also introduced the dimensionless parameter @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the constraint ( [ fr0detb ] ) can be rewritten as : [ cond1 ] _ m0+_r0+_k0++=1 .    as we have already mentioned above , the term @xmath75 is the coefficient of the dark radiation term , which is a characteristic feature of the hoava - lifshitz gravitational background .",
    "since this dark radiation component has been present also during the time of nucleosynthesis , it is subject to bounds from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . as discussed in more details in the appendix ,",
    "if the upper limit on the total amount of dark radiation allowed during bbn is expressed through the parameter @xmath76 of the effective neutrino species @xcite , then we obtain the following constraint : [ cond2 ] = 0.135_r0 .",
    "finally , we mention that as usual , the density parameter for standard model radiation ( photons and three species of neutrinos ) @xmath77 is entirely determined by @xmath78 , @xmath79 and the measured value of the cmb temperature @xcite .    in most studies of dark energy models",
    "it is customary to ignore curvature ( e.g.@xcite ) , especially concerning observational constraints .",
    "this practice is well motivated for at least two reasons .",
    "firstly , most inflationary scenarios predict a high degree of spatial flatness .",
    "secondly , the cmb data impose stringent constraints on spatial flatness in the context of constant-@xmath14 models ( for example a combination of wmap+bao+snia data @xcite provides the tight simultaneous constraints @xmath80 and @xmath81 , both at 95% confidence ) .    however , it is important to keep in mind that owing to degeneracies in the cmb power spectrum ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the limits on curvature depend on assumptions regarding the underlying dark energy scenario .",
    "for example , if instead of a constant @xmath14 one works with a linearly varying @xmath14 , parameterized as @xmath82 , the error on @xmath83 is much larger , on the order of a few percent @xcite .",
    "the constraints on curvature for different parameterizations was studied in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite showed that for some models of dark energy the constraint on the curvature is at the level of @xmath84 around a flat universe , whereas for others the data are consistent with an open universe with @xmath85 .",
    "according to @xcite , geometrical tests such as the combination of the hubble parameter @xmath86 and the angular diameter distance @xmath87 , using ( future ) data up to sufficiently high redshifts @xmath88 , might be able to disentangle curvature from dark energy evolution , though not in a model - independent way .",
    "@xcite highlight the pitfalls arising from ignoring curvature in studies of dynamical dark energy , and recommend treating @xmath83 as a free parameter to be fitted along with the other model parameters .    in the present work ,",
    "the spatial curvature plays a very crucial role , since , as it has been extensively stated in the literature @xcite , hoava - lifshitz cosmology coincides completely with @xmath66cdm if one ignores curvature .",
    "therefore , and following the discussion above , we choose to treat @xmath83 as a free parameter .    in summary ,",
    "the scenario at hand involves four parameters ( we fix @xmath79 by its 5-year wmap best - fit values , given in table 1 of @xcite ) , namely @xmath78 , @xmath83 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , subject to constraint equations ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , only two of these parameters are independent .",
    "although one would usually expect to be able to choose two of them at will , the non - linear nature of the constraint equations does not facilitate this , and one has no choice but to use @xmath78 and @xmath90 as free parameters . inverting ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) to express @xmath89 and @xmath83 in terms of these independent parameters for a given curvature ,",
    "we obtain : [ invert1 ] @xmath91=1-_m0-(1-)_r0 & & + -0.73@xmath92 & & and [ invert2 ] _",
    "k0@xmath93=.    the bbn upper limit on @xmath90 is @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "a negative value of @xmath90 ( which is usually associated with models involving decay of a massive particle ) is not possible in the present model , since @xmath89 ( i.e. @xmath66 ) is always positive .",
    "additionally , @xmath95 corresponds to the zero curvature scenario ( a non - interesting case since hoava - lifshitz cosmology with zero curvature becomes indistinguishable from @xmath66cdm ) .    in fig .",
    "[ posdb ] and fig [ negdb ] we use a combination of observational data from snia , bao and cmb to construct likelihood contours for the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath90 for positive and negative curvatures respectively .",

    "the yellow ( light ) region is excluded at the 2@xmath97 level , and the orange ( darker ) region is excluded at the 1@xmath97 level .",
    "the red ( darkest ) region is not excluded at either confidence level .",
    "the white diamond marks the best - fit point .",

    "for example , the @xmath101 limits on @xmath83 , @xmath66 and @xmath15 ( which is actually connected to @xmath66 through ( [ simpleconstants0 ] ) ) are presented in table [ dblimits ] . for convenience",
    "we have kept the factors of @xmath79 and @xmath102 .",
    "thus , one can either use the usual ansatz @xmath103 , or insert physical units using @xmath104gev and @xmath105 gev@xmath106 .",

    "however , they impose strong constraints on @xmath114 ( for the case of @xmath116 the constraints on @xmath114 for both the positive and negative curvature cases are stronger than the upper bound from bbn ) , and extremely tight constraints on @xmath117 .",
    "additionally , the constraints on the curvature are of the order of a percent .",
    "note that the contours expand as @xmath90 is reduced .",
    "this is expected since the smaller the amount of exotic components ( dark - radiation and kination - like ones ) , the closer the model is to @xmath66cdm .",
    "the approximate @xmath101 limits on the model parameters @xmath50 are presented in table [ ndblimits ] .",
    "the lower limit on @xmath118 is zero . from ( [ ndbcond1 ] ) and ( [ ndbcond2 ] ) it is clear that @xmath119 and @xmath120 attain their maximum values when @xmath118 is at its minimum , and vice versa .",
    "similarly to the previous subsection , one can either use the usual ansatz @xmath103 , or insert physical units using @xmath121gev and @xmath105 gev@xmath106 . in the later case ,",
    "one obtains that @xmath119 is tightly constrained to be at the level of the cosmological constant @xmath122ev@xmath123 , as expected .",
    "additionally , the data impose extremely stringent constraints on @xmath120 , which was also expected .",
    "however , even for such small values , the phenomenological implications of the kination - like @xmath120-component are very interesting .",
    "as discussed in detail in @xcite , it could dominate the universe prior to bbn and it could significantly affect the freeze - out , and hence the relic abundances of neutralino dark matter , by a few orders of magnitude . for dark matter that decays into leptons ( see e.g. @xcite ) this could be relevant to recent observations of high energy positrons and electrons by the pamela @xcite and atic @xcite experiments .",
    "in this work we constrained hoava - lifshitz cosmology using observational data . in particular , we considered scenarios where the gravitational sector is forced to satisfy the detailed - balance condition , and also those where this condition is relaxed .",
    "additionally , we have included the matter and radiation sectors following the usual effective fluid approach .",
    "these constructions , which cover the range of hoava - lifshitz cosmology , were confronted with data from bbn , snia , cmb and bao observations .",
    "our first result is that the detailed - balance formulation of hoava - lifshitz gravity can not fulfill observational requirements , without the analytic - continuation transformation . under the analytic continuation we found that hoava - lifshitz cosmology can be compatible with observations , and we presented the corresponding contour - plots on the model parameters .",
    "these likelihood - contours impose tight constraints on the model parameters , and the corresponding 1@xmath97-bounds are presented in table [ dblimits ] . however , we mention that although analytic continuation is necessary for a realistic cosmology , it can fatally affect the gravitational theory itself , spoiling its initial stability and well - behaving nature",
    ". therefore , the detailed - balance version of hoava - lifshitz cosmology seems rather unlikely to be a robust description of nature .",
    "the version of hoava - lifshitz cosmology in which the detailed - balance condition has been abandoned , is also compatible with observations .",
    "we constructed the likelihood - contours for the two involved free parameters , namely the curvature and the dark - radiation coefficients .",
    "as we showed , observations lead to strong bounds in these parameters , and the corresponding 1@xmath97-allowed ranges are presented in table [ ndblimits ] .",
    "this feature was expected , since the data refer to redshifts in which the novel terms of hoava - lifshitz cosmology are downgraded .",
    "however , these terms can have significant cosmological implications prior to nucleosynthesis , which could be probed by recent observations of high energy positrons and electrons by the pamela @xcite and atic @xcite experiments .",
    "although the present analysis indicates that hoava - lifshitz cosmology can be compatible with observations , it does not enlighten the discussion about possible conceptual problems and instabilities of hoava - lifshitz gravity , nor it can interfere with the questions concerning the validity of its theoretical background , which is the subject of interest of other studies .",
    "in particular , without a solid theoretical basis , it is not clear whether hoava - lifshitz gravity is able to pass the basic parametrized post newtonian ( ppn ) tests that any physically interesting gravitational theory should @xcite .",
    "the present work just faces the problem from the phenomenological point of view , and thus its results can been taken into account only if hoava - lifshitz gravity passes successfully the aforementioned theoretical tests .",
    "the authors would like to thank bob scherrer for useful discussions .",
    "in this appendix , we briefly review the main sources of observational constraints used in this work , namely , big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . + _",
    "a. big bang nucleosynthesis constraints _ + big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) provides a highly sensitive tool for probing physics beyond the standard model ( for reviews see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "bbn therefore imposes constraints on the densities of possible extra exotic radiation constituents ( beyond the standard model photons and three flavors of neutrinos ) .",
    "the constraints on the energy density of these exotic constituents are usually expressed in terms of the effective neutrino species @xmath124 . assuming that neutrinos are fully decoupled from photons and do not gain energy from @xmath125 annihilation , they are colder than photons by a factor of @xmath126 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . using also that the neutrino energy is related to the photon one by a factor of @xmath127 , the total energy density of relativistic species - photons and @xmath128 species of neutrinos - reads _",
