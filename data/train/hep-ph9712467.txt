    "[ intro ]    velocity power counting in non - relativistic quantum field theories ( nrqft ) @xcite , especially in nrqcd and nrqed , and identification of the relevant energy and momentum rgimes has proven more difficult than previously believed . in a recent article , beneke and",
    "smirnov @xcite pointed out that the velocity rescaling rules proposed by luke and manohar for coulomb interactions  @xcite , and by grinstein and rothstein for bremsstrahlung processes  @xcite , as united by luke and savage  @xcite , and by labelle s power counting scheme in time ordered perturbation theory  @xcite , do not reproduce the correct behaviour of the two gluon exchange contribution to coulomb scattering between non - relativistic particles near threshold .",
    "this has cast some doubt whether nrqcd , especially in its dimensionally regularised version @xcite , can be formulated using a self - consistent low energy lagrangean . the aim of this article is to demonstrate that a lagrangean establishing explicit velocity power counting exists , and to show that this lagrangean reproduces the results in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this article is confined to outlining the ideas to resolve the puzzle , postponing more formal arguments , calculations and derivations to a future , longer publication @xcite which will also deal with gauge theories and exemplary calculations .",
    "it is organised as follows : in sect .",
    "[ philosophy ] , the relevant rgimes of nrqft are identified .",
    "a simple example demonstrates the usefulness of dimensional regularisation in enabling explicit velocity power counting .",
    "[ rescaling ] proposes the rescaling rules necessary for a lagrangean with manifest velocity power counting .",
    "the feynman rules are given .",
    "simple examples in sect .",
    "[ bsexamples ] establish further the necessity of the new , soft rgime introduced in sect .",
    "[ philosophy ] .",
    "summary and outlook conclude the article , together with an appendix on split dimensional regularisation @xcite .",
    "[ philosophy ]    for the sake of simplicity , let us  following @xcite  deal with the lagrangean @xmath3 of a heavy , complex scalar field @xmath4 with mass @xmath5 coupled to a massless , real scalar @xmath6 . the coupling constant @xmath7 has been chosen dimensionless .",
    "@xmath4 will be referred to as `` quark '' and @xmath6 as `` gluon '' in a slight but clarifying abuse of language . in nrqft ,",
    "excitations with four - momenta bigger than @xmath5 are integrated out , giving rise to four - point interactions between quarks .",
    "the first terms of the non - relativistically reduced lagrangean read @xmath8 where the non - relativistic quark field is @xmath9 and the coefficients @xmath10 are to be determined by matching relativistic and non - relativistic scattering amplitudes .",
    "to lowest order , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the non - relativistic propagators are @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the kinetic energy of the quark .",
    "when a coulombic bound state of two quarks exists , the two typical energy and momentum scales in the non - relativistic system are the bound state energy @xmath2 and the relative momentum of the two quarks @xmath1 ( i.e.  the inverse size of the bound state ) @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath15 is the relativistic generalisation of the relative particle velocity .",
    "cuts and poles in scattering amplitudes close to threshold stem from bound states and on - shell propagation of particles in intermediate states .",
    "they give rise to infrared divergences , and in general dominate contributions to scattering amplitudes . with the two scales at hand , and energies and momenta being of either scale , three rgimes are identified in which either @xmath16 or @xmath17 in ( [ nonrelprop ] ) is on shell : @xmath18 ultrasoft gluons @xmath19 are emitted as bremsstrahlung or from excited states in the bound system .",
    "soft gluons @xmath20 do not describe bremsstrahlung : because in- and outgoing quarks @xmath21 are close to their mass shell , they have an energy of order @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , overall energy conservation forbids all processes with outgoing soft gluons but without ingoing ones , and vice versa , as their energy is of order @xmath1 .",
    "the list of particles is not yet complete : in a bound system , one needs gluons which change the quark momenta but keep them close to their mass shell : @xmath22 so far , only potential gluons and quarks , and ultrasoft gluons had been identified in the literature of power counting in nrqft @xcite . that the soft rgime was overlooked cast doubts on the completeness of nrqft after beneke and smirnov @xcite demonstrated its relevance near threshold in explicit one- and two - loop calculations . in this article",
    ", the fields representing a non - relativistic quark or gluon came naturally by identifying all possible particle poles in the non - relativistic propagators , given the two scales at hand .    when a soft gluon @xmath23 couples to a potential quark @xmath24 , the outgoing quark is far off its mass shell and carries energy and momentum of order @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , consistency requires the existence of quarks in the soft rgime as well , @xmath25 as the potential quark has a much smaller energy than either of the soft particles , it can  by the uncertainty relation  not resolve the precise time at which the soft quark emits or absorbs the soft gluon .",
    "so , we expect a `` temporal '' multipole expansion to be associated with this vertex . in general",
    ", the coupling between particles of different rgimes will not be point - like but will contain multipole expansions for the particle belonging to the weaker kinematic rgime . for the coupling of potential quarks to ultrasoft gluons ,",
    "this has been observed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "propagators will also be different from rgime to rgime : for soft quarks , @xmath26 is negligible against the kinetic energy @xmath27 , so that the soft quark propagator may be expanded in powers of @xmath26 , and @xmath28 is expected to become static to lowest order .",
    "as the energy of potential gluons is much smaller than their momentum , the @xmath29-propagator is expected to become instantaneous .    with these five fields @xmath30 representing quarks and gluons in the three different non - relativistic rgimes , soft , potential and ultrasoft",
    ", nrqft becomes self - consistent .",
    "the application of these ideas to nrqcd with the inclusion of fermions and gauge particles is straightforward and will be summarised in the next publication @xcite .",
    "an ultrasoft quark ( which would have a static propagator ) is not relevant for this paper .",
    "it is hence not considered , as is a fourth ( `` exceptional '' ) rgime in which momenta are of the order @xmath2 and energies of the order @xmath1 or any rgime in which one of the scales is set by @xmath5 .",
    "they do not derive from poles in propagators , and hence will be relevant only under `` exceptional '' circumstances .",
    "a future publication @xcite has to prove that the particle content outlined is not only consistent but complete .",
    "it is worth noticing that the particles of the soft rgime can neither be mimicked by potential gluon exchange , nor by contact terms generated by integrating out the ultraviolet modes : fields in the soft rgime have momenta of the same order as the momenta of the potential rgime , but much higher energies .",
    "therefore , seen from the potential scale they describe instantaneous but non - local interactions , as pointed out in @xcite . integrating out the scale @xmath1 , one arrives at soft gluons and quarks as point - like multi - quark interactions in the ultrasoft rgime .",
    "the physics of potential quarks and gluons will still have to be described by spatially local , but non - instantaneous interactions .",
    "the resulting theory  baptised potential nrqcd by pineda and soto @xcite  can be derived from nrqcd as presented here by integrating out the fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "there is no overlap between interactions and particles in different rgimes .    in order to clarify this point , and before investigating the interactions of the various rgimes further",
    ", the following example will demonstrate the power of dimensional regularisation in nrqft .",
    "it also highlights some points which simplify the discussion of the following sections .",
    "the integral corresponding to a one - dimensional loop @xmath33 is easily calculated using contour integration .",
    "assuming @xmath34 , the dominating contributions come from the regions where @xmath35 is close to @xmath36 ( `` smaller rgime '' ) or @xmath37 ( `` larger rgime '' ) .",
    "then , one can approximate the integral by @xmath38   { { \\mathrm{d}}k\\;}\\frac{1}{k^2-a^2+{\\mathrm{i}}\\epsilon}\\ ; \\frac{1}{k^2-b^2+{\\mathrm{i}}\\epsilon } \\;\\;.\\ ] ] in the first integral , @xmath39 is small against @xmath37 , so that a taylor expansion in @xmath40 in that rgime is applicable and yields @xmath41 if @xmath42 becomes comparable to @xmath43 , the expansion breaks down , so that the approximated integral can not be solved by contour integration . in general , the ( arbitrary ) borders of the integration rgimes ( the `` cutoffs '' ) will enter in the result , and lead to divergences as they are taken to infinity because of contributions from regions where @xmath44 .",
    "a cutoff regularisation may hence jeopardise power counting in @xmath0 .",
    "dimensional regularisation overcomes this problem in a natural and elegant way : if one treats ( [ example3 ] ) as a @xmath45-dimensional integral with @xmath46 only at the end of the calculation , the exact result will emerge as a power series in @xmath47 .",
    "first , one extends the integration rgime from the neighbourhood of @xmath48 to the whole @xmath45-dimensional space .",
    "then , one calculates the integral order by order in the expansion , still treating @xmath49 as formally small .",
    "rewriting @xmath50 only the ( @xmath51)-term contributes thanks to the fact that dimensionally regularised integrals vanish when no intrinsic scale is present , @xmath52 the result , @xmath53 is exactly the contribution one obtains in the contour integration from the pole at @xmath54 .",
    "albeit the integral was expanded over the whole space , dimensional regularisation missed the poles at @xmath55 after expansion .",
    "the integration about @xmath56 is treated likewise by expansion and term - by - term dimensional regularisation . adding this contribution , @xmath57 to ( [ example6 ] ) , one obtains term by term the taylor expansion of the exact result ( [ example1 ] ) in the small parameter @xmath47 .",
    "each of the two regularised integrals sees only the pole in either of the rgimes @xmath58 or @xmath56 .",
    "indeed , the overlap of the two rgimes is zero in dimensional regularisation , even for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "but then , the expansion in the two different rgimes can be terminated only at the cost of low accuracy .",
    "one could therefore have started with the definition of two different integration variables , one formally living in the smaller rgime with @xmath59 , the other formally living in the larger rgime , @xmath60 : @xmath61 the momentum @xmath39 is represented in each of the kinematic rgimes by either @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "the integrands _ must _ then be expanded in a formal way _ as if _ @xmath59 and @xmath60 . otherwise , the poles are double counted .",
    "if one wants to calculate to a certain order in @xmath0 , the expansion in the different variables @xmath64 and @xmath65 is just terminated at the appropriate order .",
    "no double counting of the poles can occur .",
    "coming back to the three different rgimes of nrqft ( [ regimes ] ) , there will therefore be no double counting between any pair of domains .",
    "finally , note that the limit @xmath66 is not smooth : for @xmath67 , dimensional regularisation of ( [ example3 ] ) is zero because of the absence of a scale ( [ example5 ] ) . a pinch singularity",
    "encountered in contour integration at @xmath68 behaves hence like a pole of second order in dimensional regularisation and is discarded , see also app .",
    "[ app : splitdimreg ] .    by induction",
    ", the arguments presented here can be extended to prove that for any convergent one - dimensional integral containing several scales , laurent expansion about each saddle point and dimensional regularisation gives the same result as contour integration .",
    "a formal proof of the validity of threshold expansion does presently not exist for the case of multi - dimensional and divergent integrals , but beneke and smirnov  @xcite could reproduce the correct structures of known non - trivial two - loop integrals using threshold expansion , which is highly suggestive that such a proof can be given .",
    "this claim is supported by the observation that threshold expansion is very similar to the asymptotic expansion of dimensionally regularised integrals in the limit of loop momenta going to infinity , for which such a proof exists  @xcite  .",
    "[ rescaling ]    in order to establish explicit velocity power counting in the nrqft lagrangean , one rescales the space - time coordinates such that typical momenta in either rgime become dimensionless , as first proposed in @xcite for the potential rgime , and in @xcite for the ultrasoft rgime : @xmath69 in order for the propagator terms in the nrqft lagrangean to be properly normalised , one has to set for the representatives of the gluons in the three rgimes @xmath70 and for the quark representatives @xmath71 the rescaled free lagrangean in the three regions reads then @xmath72\\;\\;,\\\\    \\label{pfreelagr }     \\mbox{potential : } & & { { \\mathrm{d}}^{3}\\:\\!\\ ! x_{\\mathrm{s}}\\;}{{\\mathrm{d}}t_{\\mathrm{u}}\\;}\\big [     \\phi_\\mathrm{p}^\\dagger\\big({\\mathrm{i}}{\\partial}_0+\\frac{1}{2 } \\vec{{\\partial}}^2 \\big )     \\phi_\\mathrm{p } + { \\frac{1}{2}}\\big({\\mathcal{a}}_\\mathrm{p } { \\vec{{\\partial}}}^2 { \\mathcal{a}}_\\mathrm{p } - v^2     { \\mathcal{a}}_\\mathrm{p } { \\partial}^2_0 { \\mathcal{a}}_\\mathrm{p}\\big ) \\big]\\;\\;,\\\\    \\label{ufreelagr }     \\mbox{ultrasoft : } & & { { \\mathrm{d}}^{3}\\:\\!\\",

    "derivatives are to be taken with respect to the rescaled variables of the volume element .",

    "must be treated as insertions as in the example , ( [ example1 ] ) .",
    "insertions are represented by the ( un - rescaled ) feynman rules @xmath74 except for the physical gluons @xmath20 and @xmath19 , there is no distinction between feynman and retarded propagators in nrqft : antiparticle propagation has been eliminated by the field transformation from the relativistic to the non - relativistic lagrangean , and both propagators have maximal support for on - shell particles , the feynman propagator outside the light cone vanishing like @xmath75 .",
    "feynman s perturbation theory becomes more convenient than the time - ordered formalism , as less diagrams have to be calculated .",

    "the soft exchange diagram vanishes , so that no new contribution is obtained .",
    "it is not even necessary to specify how soft quarks couple to external sources : if energy is conserved at the production vertex , the integral to be calculated is @xmath99 as the gluon is soft , @xmath100 and the quark propagators must be expanded in @xmath101 , giving zero to any order as no scale is present in the dimensionally regularised integral .",

    ", the proposed nrqft lagrangean reproduces the result for the planar graph of the relativistic theory _ only if _ the soft gluon and the soft quark are accounted for : the four - fermion contact interaction produces just a @xmath135-term , graphs containing ultrasoft gluons were absent , and the potential gluon ( [ vertex2ppresult ] ) gave no @xmath136 contribution .",

    "[ conclusions ]    the objective of this article was a simple presentation of the ideas behind explicit velocity power counting in dimensionally regularised nrqft .",
    "it started with the identification of three different rgimes of scale for on - shell particles in nrqft from the poles in the non - relativistic propagators .",
    "this leads in a natural way to the existence of a new quark field and a new gluon field in the soft scaling rgime @xmath138 . in it , quarks are static and gluons on shell , and hqet becomes a sub - set of nrqcd .",
    "neither of the five fields in the three rgimes should be thought of as `` physical particles '' .",
    "rather , they represent the `` true '' quark and gluon in the respective rgimes as the infrared - relevant degrees of freedom . none of the rgimes overlap .",
    "an nrqft lagrangean has been proposed which leads to the correct behaviour of scattering and production amplitudes .",
    "it establishes explicit velocity power counting which is preserved to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the reason for the existence of such a lagrangean , once dimensional regularisation is chosen to complete the theory , was elaborated upon in a simple example : the non - commutativity of the expansion in small parameters with dimensionally regularised integrals .    due to the similarity between the calculation of the examples in the work presented here and in @xcite",
    ", one may get the impression that the lagrangean presented is only a simple re - formulation of the threshold expansion .",
    "partially , this is true , and a future publication @xcite will indeed show the equivalence of the two approaches to all orders in the threshold and coupling expansion .",
    "a list of other topics to be addressed there contains : the straightforward generalisation to nrqcd ; a proof whether the particle content outlined above is not only consistent but complete , i.e.  that no new fields ( e.g.  an ultrasoft quark ) or `` exceptional '' rgimes arise ; an investigation of the influence of soft quarks and gluons on bound state calculations in nrqed and nrqcd ; a full list of the various couplings between the different rgimes and an exploitation of their relevance for physical processes . the formal reason why double counting between different rgimes and especially between soft and ultrasoft gluons does not occur , a derivation of the way soft quarks couple to external sources , and the rle of soft gluons in compton scattering deserve further attention , too .",
    "i would like to stress that the diagrammatic threshold expansion derived here allows for a more automatic and intuitive approach and makes it easier to determine the order in @xmath139 to which a certain graph contributes . on the other hand , the nrqft lagrangean",
    "can easily be applied to bound state problems . as the threshold expansion of beneke and smirnov starts in a relativistic setting",
    ", it may formally be harder to treat bound states there .",
    "indeed , i believe that even if one may not be able to prove the conjectures of the one starting from the other , both approaches will profit from each other in the wedlock of nrqft and threshold expansion .",

    "split dimensional regularisation agrees with other methods to compute loop integrals in non - covariant gauges , such as the non - principal value prescription @xcite , but two features make it especially attractive : it treats the temporal and spatial components of the loop integrations on an equal footing , and no recipes are necessary .",
