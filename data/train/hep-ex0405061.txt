    "the search for double hypernuclei ( dh ) ( nuclei with two @xmath0 s replacing two non - strange nucleons ) , started in the sixties with the pioneering works of danysz  _ et al . _ and prowse  _ et al .",
    "_ , who first observed @xmath1  @xcite and @xmath2  @xcite in emulsions exposed to @xmath3 beams . both experiments measured @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the measurement of these quantities is at present the only experimental way to collect information about the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction and this is the reason of the stronger interest for the dh investigation with respect to single hypernuclei .",
    "other interesting features of dh are : a ) their nuclear structure , with two levels both filled by strange hadrons ; b ) the possibility to explore the existence of the @xmath6 dibaryon ( a double strange system of 6 quarks predicted several years ago by jaffe  @xcite ) ; c ) the information about the levels of the @xmath7-atom , that is formed during the dh production process . in spite of the interest of these topics ,",
    "only few experiments have been devoted to dh so far , mainly because of the difficulty to produce them .",
    "the traditional way is to produce a double strange @xmath7 particle via the strangeness exchange reaction @xmath8 between a @xmath3 meson and a proton bound in a nucleus , giving @xmath9 and @xmath7 ; this last , if decelerated to rest before decaying , can be captured inside a nucleus in which it interacts with a proton eventually releasing two @xmath0 s in two hypernuclear levels .",
    "the @xmath7 energy may be of order of some hundred mevs , thus the slowing down process takes long time in ordinary matter .",
    "this explains why the probability of dh formation is so low : in fact , danysz  @xcite and prowse  @xcite observed one dh event each , among a @xmath3 number of around a million .",
    "in more recent experiments at bnl - ags ( e885 ) and kek ( ps e176 ) about @xmath10 and @xmath11 stopped @xmath7 s respectively were observed , as reviewed by pochodzalla  @xcite . also at the planned japanese hadron facility ( jhf ) the number of produced @xmath7 s is expected to be of order of some thousands .",
    "furthermore the results obtained from experiments in terms of the above mentioned binding energies are too much different , clearly outside the experimental errors ( see again  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , while the existence of dh seems ascertained , an increase of statistics in the @xmath7 production is mandatory in order to step forward in their understanding .",
    "even though the traditional double strangeness exchange reaction will be pursued in the next future at jhf , as already mentioned , nevertheless the advent of new antiproton facilities , like hesr and jhf ( second phase ) , allows the scientific community to explore alternative techniques of @xmath7 production from antiproton beams .",
    "a first one was proposed by kilian  @xcite who suggested the annihilation of antiprotons at rest to produce @xmath3 s which subsequently could exchange strangeness with the residual nucleus , giving a @xmath7 hyperon .",
    "this technique requires a low energy antiproton machine and could be implemented , for instance , at cern - ad .",
    "but also in high energy antiproton machines like hesr and jhf , the @xmath7 hyperon may be directly produced in the antiproton annihilation reaction together with its antiparticle .",
    "the advantages are :    1 .   an higher rate with respect to the double reaction involving the annihilation at rest ; 2 .   the presence of the antiparticle , to be used for tagging purposes .",
    "the only disadvantage is the high momentum of the @xmath7 s which need to be strongly decelerated before being captured at rest .    in this work we present the first preliminary results of a monte carlo simulation based on a simplified intra - nuclear cascade model , and",
    "performed to explore the rates of the produced and stopped @xmath7 s and their probability to be captured forming a dh , as may be expected in the future panda experiment at the hesr - gsi facility .    in sec .",
    "[ production ] , the @xmath7 production techniques are illustrated ; in sec .",
    "[ section xi production ] , the details of the antiproton annihilation into the @xmath7 s are discussed ; in sec .  [ slowing down ]",
    ", the slowing down processes of @xmath7 inside the residual nucleus , in the target and in a second target devoted to the dh formation are analysed ; in sec .",
    "[ results ] , the results of our simulation in terms of dh rates are reported , and finally in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] the conclusions are drawn .",
    "the simplest way for producing double strange nuclear systems is the dh direct formation through @xmath12 reactions ; on the contrary , an indirect method is the formation using @xmath7 capture at rest .",
    "the latter is known to have a higher rate  @xcite .",
    "a classical technique , adopted in the e176 experiment at kek  @xcite , is based on a @xmath13 kaon beam that induces the quasi - free nuclear reaction @xmath14 , thus producing a relatively high number of fast @xmath15 hyperons .",
    "these hyperons subsequently slow down in an emulsion stack and some @xmath16 hypernuclei are formed following the @xmath15 capture at rest . in such kind of experiments ,",
    "the emulsion is also the detector , with high enough resolution for tracking the formed hypernuclei and the products of their decay as well .",
    "a further improvement has been obtained in e373 at kek  @xcite , through a @xmath13 beam ( with momentum @xmath17 ) impinging on a diamond target in which the same reaction previously sketched occurs , though at far higher rate : in the experimental setup , the diamond block was followed by an emulsion stack as for e176 and the tracking detector was a fiber - bundle system . in all these experiments ,",
    "the @xmath15 hyperon is captured in a light nucleus ( i.e. carbon , nitrogen or oxygen ) of the emulsion and therefore the observed double hypernuclei are @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath18 .",
    "let us consider now the new technique proposed for the planned panda experiment at hesr - gsi ; it relies on the same method of stopped @xmath7 s , the main difference being that the hyperon production reaction is realized through an intense beam of antiprotons on a target of @xmath19 nuclei ( where @xmath20 is the mass number , @xmath21 is the atomic number and @xmath22 is the neutron number ) .",
    "the two reactions of interest are @xmath23 and @xmath24    in reaction  [ antiproton - neutron reaction ] , the energetic antiproton annihilates on a neutron bound inside the @xmath25 nucleus , while in reaction  [ antiproton - proton reaction ] it annihilates on a proton .",
    "the fast @xmath15 slightly slows down in the production target itself , but the main part of its energy - loss process occurs in a second separate target , that is also the place in which a statistical collection of double hypernuclei is supposed to be formed with some probability . in both reactions  [ antiproton - neutron reaction ] and  [ antiproton - proton reaction ] , beside the @xmath16 hyperon @xmath7 , an anti - hyperon ( @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) is released too , according to the strangeness and baryon conservation laws of strong interactions : this antiparticle can play a crucial role in the experimental detection of the whole double hypernuclei formation , as it may be used for trigger purposes .    before proceeding ,",
    "we want to point out that a still different technique has also been proposed  @xcite , in which an antiproton interacts at rest with the @xmath19 nucleus .",
    "a possible reaction is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath13 resonance at @xmath30 , that subsequently interacts with the residual nucleus , giving @xmath31 where the @xmath15 hyperon emerges with a momentum between @xmath32 and @xmath33 approximately . in comparison with the method based on reactions  [ antiproton - neutron reaction ] and  [ antiproton - proton reaction ] ,",
    "this technique has the disadvantage that the @xmath15 production occurs in two distinct steps ( reactions  [ step1 ] and  [ step2 ] ) , each one characterized by a somewhat low probability .",
    "let us start considering the @xmath15 production from reaction  [ antiproton - neutron reaction ] .",
    "a highly energetic antiproton @xmath34 interacts with a neutron @xmath35 bound in a nuclear potential well . in",
    "what follows , we assume that the neutron be free ; indeed , we expect that the total antiproton energy be of order of a few gevs , while the average binding energy of a nucleon is roughly @xmath36 for the most tightly bound nuclei ( i.e. @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "if we consider @xmath34 momenta below @xmath40 production threshold , the previous discussion allows us to consider the reaction as a two - body process , with the manifest advantage that its simple kinematics can be treated analytically , starting from the relativistic four - vector energy - momentum conservation ; a similar discussion also applies to reaction  [ antiproton - proton reaction ] .",
    "hence , the two reactions simplify as @xmath41 and @xmath42 and from now on , we shall refer to them both as strangeness creation reactions , namely scrs .",
    "the calculated threshold for the two scrs ( neglecting the slight difference between the proton mass and the neutron mass ) is located at an antiproton momentum of @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , the upper limit for the two - body exit channel ( i.e. below pion production ) is @xmath44 .",
    "let be @xmath45 the angle between the direction of the incident antiproton @xmath34 and the direction of the outgoing @xmath15 hyperon , in the laboratory frame of reference . as it is well known from the relativistic kinematics of two - body reactions with threshold , the @xmath45 angle ranges between @xmath46 and a maximum , @xmath47 , that is a function of the antiproton momentum @xmath48 . furthermore , for any given value of @xmath45 ,",
    "two different momenta of the @xmath15 hyperon are allowed , whose relative probability strongly depends on the dynamics of the reaction itself .",
    "all these peculiar characteristics are shown in fig .",
    "[ threeplots ] referring to the scr of eq .",
    "[ antiproton - neutron reaction simplified ] : the dependence of the maximum angle @xmath47 on @xmath48 looks evident . at the antiproton momentum @xmath49",
    ", we obtain that the maximum angle is @xmath50 .     against the exit angle @xmath45 after scr , considering three different values of the antiproton momentum , namely @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "both first and second kinematical solution are shown together .",
    "the curve labelled @xmath49 has been adopted in our calculations . ]    the argument that led us to the choice of @xmath48 relies on the results of the quark - gluon string model  @xcite which predicts that the @xmath54 reaction cross section @xmath55 shows a maximum at an antiproton momentum of around @xmath56 ; in this case , the estimated maximum value is @xmath57 .",
    "then , in our following calculations , we adopt @xmath49 and we suppose that the same total nuclear cross section , @xmath58 , does hold for both scrs of eqs .",
    "[ antiproton - neutron reaction simplified ] and  [ antiproton - proton reaction simplified ] . lying on these physical hypotheses we obtain that , as far as the first ( most probable ) kinematical solution is concerned , the @xmath15 momentum ranges from @xmath59 in the forward direction , to @xmath60 at the limit angle while , considering the second solution , it spans from @xmath61 to about @xmath60 respectively , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ threeplots ] .    because of the high average momentum , the energy - loss process is of central importance in the planned experiment , and therefore the evaluation of the @xmath15 slowing down is worth while",
    "; we have performed it through a monte carlo simulation , as described in sec .  [ slowing down ] . as a starting point",
    ", we generate @xmath62 @xmath15 particles produced from scr for each solution , assuming that reaction  [ antiproton - neutron reaction simplified ] occurs through a s - wave in the centre of mass frame of reference , namely assuming an uniform spherical distribution . according to the @xmath56 curve in fig .",
    "[ threeplots ] , the momentum spectra of the simulated @xmath15 hyperons are presented in fig .",
    "[ momentum spectra after scr ] , for both kinematical solutions .        for tagging purposes ,",
    "the momentum spectrum of the anti - hyperon is of great interest ; our computer simulated results are reported in fig .",
    "[ antikaon momentum spectra after scr ] . the @xmath63 ( or @xmath64 ) momentum ranges from @xmath65 to @xmath66 , with an average emission angle of @xmath67 , in first solution , and from @xmath68 to @xmath69 in second solution , with an average angle equal to @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , the maximum angle is @xmath71 ; therefore , the tagged anti - hyperon is expected to be released very close to the antiproton beam direction .",
    "let us start by noticing that the @xmath15 slowing down process consists of two distinct steps :    1 .   a sequence of nuclear elastic scattering events with some of the @xmath72 nucleons of the residual nucleus in which the annihilation has occurred ; 2 .   the energy loss by ionization in the ordinary matter of the two targets .",
    "we shall discuss each step separately .",
    "we assume , on the basis of ref .",
    "@xcite , that the total elastic cross section for the @xmath73 and @xmath74 scattering processes be @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , we assume a differential elastic cross section @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the second mandelstam variable , and @xmath78 is suitably taken as @xmath79  @xcite . furthermore , we model the nucleus as a homogeneous sphere of nucleons of radius @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "we perform the numerical simulation of this first slowing down step in the framework of an inc - like ( intra nuclear cascade ) model  @xcite , starting from the distribution of fast hyperons shown in fig .",
    "[ momentum spectra after scr ] .",
    "the basic hypothesis of this model is that the @xmath82 residual nucleus does survive for a time longer than the time spent by the hyperon during its intra - nuclear path .",
    "furthermore , the scattering exit angle of @xmath15 after each nuclear scattering is chosen uniformly in the centre of mass frame of reference .    as far as nuclear scattering events are concerned , we treat these processes as instantaneous since the calculated average spent time is of order @xmath83 ( proper time ) , while the @xmath15 mean life , in its rest frame of reference",
    ", is @xmath84 .",
    "we obtain that , from the @xmath85 simulated random walks , @xmath86 of the hyperons scatter in the residual nucleus at least once if we consider the first kinematical solution ( the maximum number of consecutive scattering events being @xmath87 ) , and @xmath88 considering the second solution ( and the maximum number of scattering events is , correspondingly , @xmath89 ) .",
    "the main physical effects due to hyperon - nucleon elastic scattering are twofold : on one hand , the @xmath90 momentum spectrum is modified with respect to that of fig .",
    "[ momentum spectra after scr ] , showing a low momentum tail from @xmath60 down to @xmath91 ( first solution ) and from @xmath61 to @xmath92 ( second solution ) ; on the other hand , the angle @xmath93 between the exit direction and the antiproton direction ( @xmath94 if the hyperon does not scatter at all ) , after the nuclear scattering process , spans from @xmath46 up to @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively , which are much higher than the limit angle @xmath47 defined in sec .",
    "[ section xi production ] .",
    "thus , this first step provides a non negligible fraction of hyperons with relatively low momentum and large angles .",
    "the next step , involving the passage of particles through matter and the ionization energy - loss , further modifies the momentum spectrum , without modifying the @xmath93 angle . due to the low probability",
    ", the nuclear scattering of the hyperon inside the target has been neglected .",
    "thus , the final flight in the experimental apparatus is a simple straight line .      in the study of the energy - loss during the passage of particles through matter",
    ", the geometry of the experimental setup plays a crucial role , because it determines the effective hyperon path as a function of the exit angle @xmath93 , and thus the slowing down effectiveness .",
    "we adopt here a simple geometry consisting of two distinct targets : the first one , in which the scr takes place , is a thin parallelepipedal wire of gallium or gold ( @xmath97 long and @xmath98 square ) orthogonal to the beam direction , while the second one is a diamond parallelepiped ( @xmath99 as transverse dimensions and @xmath100 thick ) with a hole of radius @xmath101 in its centre .",
    "the two targets are separated by a @xmath102 vacuum gap .",
    "the physics of our simulation essentially relies on the bethe - bloch equation , which expresses the mean rate of energy - loss per unit length : we take it from  @xcite and we report it here for the sake of discussion @xmath103\\ ;   , \\label{bethe bloch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the hyperon kinetic energy , @xmath106 is the density of target material , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the atomic number and the mass number of medium , @xmath110 is the dimensionless velocity of hyperons , @xmath111 is the electron mass , @xmath112 is the relativistic factor , @xmath113 is the mean excitation energy , @xmath114 is the hyperon rest mass and @xmath115 is the speed of light .",
    "the parameters @xmath116 and @xmath117 , usually negligible at high energy , play an important role in our similation because the final stage of the slowing down process takes a major fraction of the total time spent by the hyperon before being stopped ; the value of @xmath117 has been taken from the accurate work of sternheimer  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and reads @xmath118 with @xmath119 , and where @xmath116 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite for the diamond target .",
    "the total time @xmath124 elapsed during the energy - loss process is comparable with the @xmath7 mean life , @xmath125 : thus , a fraction of hyperons decays prior to complete stopping .",
    "in order to evaluate the number of surviving @xmath7 s , the following procedure has been adopted .",
    "each @xmath7 has been assigned a lifetime @xmath126 according to the @xmath127 distribution , in the frame in which the particle is at rest ; at each interval of lost kinetic energy @xmath128 , the corresponding time interval @xmath129 ( in the laboratory frame ) spent by @xmath7 to travel a path @xmath130 has been transformed into the rest frame in order to obtain the total proper time elapsed @xmath124 , and compare it with the proper lifetime @xmath126 . thus , eq .  [ bethe bloch ] should be solved provided that the condition @xmath131 be satisfied , where @xmath132 is the final time after complete stopping of the hyperon in the laboratory frame of reference .",
    "[ bethe bloch ] can be formally expressed through @xmath133    furthermore , the hyperon momentum @xmath134 depends over @xmath105 as @xmath135    from eqs .",
    "[ time condition ] , [ formal bethe bloch ] and  [ momentum - energy relation ] , we straightforwardly obtain @xmath136 @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the stopping range and @xmath139 is the hyperon s initial kinetic energy . performing a numerical integration of eq .",
    "[ range ] , at each step the corresponding time integral of eq .",
    "[ time ] is calculated and checked whether @xmath124 is lower or greater than the lifetime @xmath126 . in the former case the integration proceeds until complete stopping , otherwise the hyperon decays along its path .",
    "the simulation procedure described in the previous section has been applied to the above mentioned geometry ( a wire as @xmath7 production target followed by a second one as hypernuclear target ) ; furthermore we run the simulation twice , considering two different materials ( gallium and gold ) for the wire , in order to check the effectiveness of the atomic weight on hyperon production . for both materials , @xmath85 @xmath7",
    "s have been generated in a spot of radius @xmath140 on the surface of the wire .",
    "the calculated parameters of our simulation are :    * the fraction @xmath141 of hyperons stopped in the second target ; * the fraction @xmath142 of hyperons decayed before stopping ; * the fraction @xmath143 of hyperons lost in the gap between the two targets or in the central hole of the second target .",
    "since reaction  [ antiproton - neutron reaction ] can produce @xmath7 s of two different momenta , both kinematical solutions have been simulated separately .",
    "the most relevant parameters for the experiment are the total number @xmath144 of stopped and detected @xmath7 s per second and the number @xmath145 of produced and detected double hypernuclei per second . in order to calculate these values from the simulated fractions",
    "already defined , one has to make a few reasonable assumptions about the luminosity of the machine and the detection efficiency ; moreover , other physical parameters mentioned below have been roughly estimated just to get a first insight of the rates , though further accurate evaluation is needed .    as already discussed in sec .",
    "[ section xi production ] , we have assumed a total cross section @xmath146 for the scr reaction between an antiproton and a free nucleon at @xmath56 ; accordingly , the corresponding reaction cross section of reaction  [ antiproton - neutron reaction ] occurring on a neutron inside a nucleus reads @xmath147 where the surface annihilation scaling has been taken into account  @xcite .    furthermore , we assume a luminosity of the antiproton beam of roughly @xmath148 , as realistically expected at hesr , and a reconstruction efficiency for the whole detector @xmath149 .    following refs .",
    "@xcite , we also assume that the conversion probability ( i.e. the probability for the hyperonic @xmath15-nucleus conversion into a @xmath150-hypernucleus ) per stopped @xmath15 be @xmath151 , and that the level population fraction be @xmath152 ; the probability of transition per event has been taken as @xmath153 and the @xmath154-photo peak efficiency as @xmath155 .",
    "thus , the number of stopped @xmath7 s and of formed @xmath150-hypernuclei can be calculated through @xmath156 and @xmath157    the final results are reported in tab .",
    "[ table of results ] for both gallium and gold wires and both kinematical solutions .    0.1 in    .results of the monte carlo simulation of the double hypernuclei production , considering two materials ( gallium and gold ) for the hyperon production wire .",
    "each kinematical solution has been investigated separately , and the corresponding results are shown .",
    "( see text for the physical meaning of the different parameters ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table of results ]    the relative weight of each solution is at present totally unknown as no measurements of the differential cross section for reactions  [ antiproton - neutron reaction simplified ] and  [ antiproton - proton reaction simplified ] exist nor theoretical estimates as well .",
    "hence , the actual value of @xmath145 is located between the two values of first and second solution reported in tab .",
    "[ table of results ] .",
    "being conservative , one may take the value of the first solution only ; nevertheless , even in this pessimistic hypothesis , the total number of stopped @xmath7 s is around @xmath158 per month and the total number of formed double hypernuclei is around @xmath159 per month considering the gallium wire , while we obtain @xmath160 and @xmath161 respectively when considering the gold wire .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath34 annihilation occurs through reaction  [ antiproton - proton reaction ] instead of reaction  [ antiproton - neutron reaction ] , the processes of @xmath7 slowing down and double hypernuclei formation are in practice identical to those considered so far : therefore , it is reasonable to expect that the total @xmath7 production and double hypernuclei formation should be enhanced by a factor @xmath162 .    as a first indication from the values of the stopped @xmath7 s , one can observe that the weight of the nucleus strongly influence the hyperon slowing down through nuclear scatterings .    of course these results",
    "depends on the estimates of the machine , detector and physical parameters chosen for our simulation , but the values assumed here seem quite realistic indeed .",
    "in fact , hesr design s first priority is the high luminosity and the panda apparatus will be an ensemble of several detectors with good reconstruction capabilities .",
    "a preliminary evaluation of the rates for the complete stopping of a @xmath7 hyperon , produced through a high energy antiproton interacting with a gallium or a gold nucleus , in a diamond ( carbon ) target has been performed using a monte carlo technique based on an inc - like model .",
    "the chosen geometry is suitable for the panda experiment project at the future hesr machine at gsi .",
    "the results , relying on the expected performances of the apparatus , show the feasibility of a large production of double hypernuclei : our preliminary estimates , in terms of stopped @xmath7 s and formed double hypernuclei , are larger than the previous data existing in literature and also larger than the expectation of other future experiments and machines .",
    "a lot of calculations are of course still necessary in order to fully design the geometrical arrangement , the sizes and the materials of the targets , in order to optimize the production and to meet the beam requirement of the machine , and this will be the future work for the next months .",
