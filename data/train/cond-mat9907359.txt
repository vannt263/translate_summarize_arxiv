    "colloidal solutions consist of mesoscopic particles , with diameters between @xmath0 m and @xmath1 m , suspended in a microscopic fluid .",
    "colloidal particles of a same chemical species are not necessarily identical , but may differ in size , charge or other properties.@xcite this phenomenon is called `` polydispersity '' , and systems in which it does not occur are said to be `` monodisperse '' .",
    "a microscopic description of a fluid with a significant polydispersity is a difficult task , requiring a large number of independent variables .",
    "a great simplification is , however , possible by using the so - called _ continuous - mixture _ , or _",
    "polydisperse - mixture _ , formalism .",
    "such a model , adopted also in this paper , views the fluid as containing an infinite number of components ( @xmath2 ) , with a continuous distribution of size and/or other properties .",
    "all molar fractions of the components are then replaced by a single distribution function , which describes the composition of the system .",
    "since polydispersity can significantly affect the microscopic ordering of colloidal suspensions , it must be taken into account in the analysis of experimental data on such fluids .",
    "in particular , we are interested in static structure factors obtainable from small angle scattering of light , neutrons or x - rays .",
    "in this paper we present integral equation ( ie ) calculations for the structure of polydisperse one - species fluids constituted of uncharged particles with hard sphere ( hs ) or lennard - jones ( lj ) interactions , with polydispersity in size and , for lj systems , also in energy parameters .",
    "ies of statistical mechanics represent a powerful , although approximate , tool to determine both structures and thermodynamics of fluids in a simple way .",
    "however , while using ies for pure fluids or binary mixtures is a rather common and successful practice , their application to multicomponent systems with large @xmath3 or @xmath2 is problematic and , consequently , less frequent in the literature.@xcite only in special cases , when analytical solutions are available , ie calculations for polydisperse fluids can be performed in a rigorous and relatively easy way .",
    "for instance , a closed analytical formula for the scattering intensity of polydisperse hard spheres was obtained by vrij @xcite from the solution of the percus - yevick ( py ) ie .",
    "similar expressions were derived for polydisperse charged hard spheres , by using the corresponding analytical solution in the mean spherical approximation.@xcite    unfortunately , for most `` closures '' and for most potentials , including the lj one , the ies must be solved numerically , requiring more and more computer memory and time with increasing @xmath3 , so that the problem soon becomes practically intractable ( daguanno _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reached @xmath4 for yukawa plus hs interactions ) .    to overcome the impossibility of investigating polydisperse systems when ies have to be solved numerically ,",
    "alternative routes have been proposed .",
    "the common idea is to replace the polydisperse fluid with an appropriate system with very few components .",
    "a first method , not analyzed in this paper , builds up an equivalent _ effective mixture _ with @xmath5 new components , whose molar fractions and diameters - in the case of size polydispersity - are determined by replacing the continuous size distribution with a @xmath6-component histogram and requiring the equality of the first @xmath7 moments of the two distributions ( @xmath8 or 3 is usually sufficient).@xcite other methods assume that the properties of polydisperse fluids can be obtained , to a good approximation , from those of _",
    "pure _ fluids , if suitably averaged parameters and appropriate recipes are used .",
    "this same basic idea has often been employed , in several variants ( van der waals equation of state , perturbation theories , etc . ) , to predict thermodynamics of liquid mixtures with a small number of components.@xcite some significant applications of these concepts have also been made to structural studies of polydisperse systems , mainly by experimentalists in the analysis of scattering data .",
    "kotlarchyk and chen @xcite introduced the _ decoupling approximation _ ( da ) , which is perhaps the most famous of these approaches and involves an exact evaluation of the form factors for all components of the polydisperse system , but approximates every partial structure factor with that of an one - component fluid . a second approximation , suggested by pedersen @xcite and known as _ local monodisperse approximation _ ( lma ) , replaces the polydisperse fluid not with a single pure system , but with a superposition of non - interacting pure fluids",
    ", whose number equals that of the species in the mixture .",
    "the aim of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , both da and lma are discussed in terms of pair correlation functions , to get some insight into their shortcomings .",
    "second , we propose a simple _ scaling approximation _ ( sa ) , which , with respect to da and lma , takes excluded volume effects more correctly into account and therefore yields significantly improved structure factors . by using corresponding states arguments",
    "the sa derives all pair correlation functions of a polydisperse mixture from an appropriate pure fluid counterpart , at the cost of _ only one _ ie computation .",
    "the performance of sa is tested on two typical potential models , namely polydisperse hard spheres and polydisperse lennard - jones particles . for hs systems , sa results for the `` measurable '' structure factor",
    "are compared to those obtained from vrij s analytical expression,@xcite which is exact within the py approximation . for polydisperse lj fluids , sa is tested against molecular dynamics data generated for this purpose .",

    "pedersen justified this approximation on the ground of a physical picture , in some sense complementary to da , which assumes that particle sizes and positions are completely correlated .",
    "this means that particle size varies slowly with position , so that every particle is surrounded by particles of the same size and the system looks _ locally monodisperse_. on the other hand , lma may simply be regarded , in a corresponding states framework , as a conformality assumption not for @xmath123 but for @xmath161 , done to reduce the double sum to a single sum in both structure factors .      after analyzing da and lma in terms of pair correlation functions ,",

    "finally , it is worth looking at the number - number structure factor @xmath67 . in figure",
    "[ f : fig3 ] a comparison is made among @xmath185 , @xmath184 , and @xmath234 .",
    "the results for @xmath185 were obtained from our closed analytical expression , which is exact within the py approximation ( griffith _ et al . _",
    "@xcite presented similar data , calculated without using a closed formula @xcite ) . for @xmath235 ,",
    "all these structure factors coincide , but with increasing @xmath88 the differences become larger and larger . in particular , @xmath185 exhibits a more rapid flattening of the first peak than @xmath184 , while its increase in the low-@xmath212 region is much more dramatic ( see the extreme case @xmath236 , also included ) .",
    "since that @xmath237 measures the fluctuations in the total particle density ( irrespective of the species ) , this behavior of @xmath67 provides more physical information than that provided by @xmath66 .",
    "figure [ f : fig4 ] then shows the @xmath67 predicted by sa , compared to @xmath185 .",
    "the performance of sa is good in the first peak region and beyond , but the approximation fails in the low-@xmath212 region and is unable to reproduce the number density fluctuations correctly .",
    "this discrepancy is , however , less important in @xmath66 , which is the structure factor more directly comparable with small angle scattering data . in fact , multiplying @xmath46 by the product of form factors @xmath238 reduces the mentioned defect ( as already seen in figure [ f : fig2 ] ) ; moreover , a significant part of the region near @xmath239 is experimentally unaccessible .",
    "from @xmath240 and the berthelot rule , eqs .",
    "( [ pcl13 ] ) and ( [ pl2 ] ) , it follows that    @xmath241    with @xmath242 .    as for hs mixtures ,",
    "in addition to a density @xmath243 , it is convenient to define a second dimensionless variable @xmath244 , or @xmath245 , which plays the same role as the hs packing fraction @xmath157 ( although , rigorously , a lj particle has no definite boundary and volume ) . for the schulz size distribution , @xmath246 .",
    "we performed ie and md calculations for lj mixtures at fixed @xmath247 , @xmath248 ( @xmath249 ) with @xmath75 and polydispersity parameter @xmath235 ( monodisperse case ) , @xmath250 and @xmath196 . for @xmath235 ,",
    "one has @xmath251 , and the corresponding thermodynamic state , @xmath252 , @xmath247 , is near the triple point in the lj phase diagram .",
    "@xcite with increasing @xmath88 at fixed @xmath253 , @xmath193 decreases . taking into account the superiority of sa with respect to da , lma and vdw1 approximation in the polydisperse hs case ,",
    "our ie calculations for the lj potential were restricted only to sa ( some information about the performance of vdw1 for lj potentials can be found in works by hoheisel _",
    "et al._,@xcite but only for binary mixtures ) .",
    "kofke and glandt @xcite presented similar monte carlo results for a polydisperse lj model of n - paraffins . unfortunately , since these authors started from an activity distribution , rather than a composition distribution , their simulations are not directly comparable with our ie calculations .",
    "the md simulations employed 1000 particles , in a cube with periodic boundary conditions , and , using andersen s stochastic collision method,@xcite described a fluid constrained at constant @xmath248 and maintained in contact with an heat bath .",
    "the equations of motion were integrated using the velocity verlet algorithm.@xcite the atomic diameters @xmath69 where drawn from a schulz distribution at the desired @xmath88 , with well depths given by eq .",
    "( [ lj1 ] ) . to reduce the sampling noise ,",
    "the distribution was periodically regenerated during the simulation . to avoid truncation effects in the fourier transforms ,",
    "@xmath66 was evaluated in the simulation using directly the definition    @xmath254    where @xmath255 is the wavevector , @xmath256 , @xmath257 is the position of the @xmath258th particle and @xmath259 its form factor , eq .",
    "( [ scatt ] ) .",
    "a similar expression was used to obtain @xmath67 , and we also calculated its @xmath13-space counterpart , the number - number correlation function @xcite @xmath260 .      the scaling approximation for the lj potential is derived from eq .",
    "( [ cs14 ] ) with the choice @xmath261 and @xmath146 ( analogous to eq .",
    "( [ sa1 ] ) for the hs potential ) , and    @xmath262    which is consistent with eqs .",
    "( [ pcl13 ] ) and ( [ lj1 ] ) .",
    "the sa for lj therefore reads    @xmath263    note that @xmath264 decreases with increasing @xmath88 : with eqs .",
    "( [ cs15 ] ) , ( [ salj2 ] ) and the schulz distribution , @xmath265^{z/3}$ ] .    to evaluate @xmath266 , we solved numerically , for each @xmath264 value , the mhnc - ml integral equation with @xmath231 and @xmath267 ( which corresponds to @xmath268 , just as in the hs case ) . from the resulting @xmath142 ,",
    "the polydisperse structure factors @xmath174 and @xmath173 were finally evaluated from the obvious analogue of eq .",
    "( [ sa4 ] ) , in the same manner presented in detail for the hs potential .    in figures",
    "[ f : fig5 ] and [ f : fig6 ] the @xmath174 and @xmath173 results are tested against the corresponding md data .",
    "the overall agreement is good . for @xmath195",
    "the positions of maxima and minima and the shape of both structure factors are correctly predicted ; only the height of the first peak is slightly underestimated . for @xmath269 the first peak",
    "is well reproduced in @xmath173 , but not equally well in @xmath174 . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath173 is completely off in the region near the origin , where the discrepancy in @xmath174 is less dramatic .",
    "finally , figure [ f : fig7 ] shows the behavior of @xmath260 : also in @xmath111space sa works quite well . in the ie calculations we employed the expression @xcite    @xmath270",
    "the md data for the monodisperse case , @xmath235 , have been found to be in perfect agreement with the monte carlo results for @xmath271 published by llano - restrepo and chapman @xcite ( not reported in figure [ f : fig7 ] ) .",
    "the slightly worse performance of sa in the lj case with @xmath269 , with respect to the hs one with the same polydispersity , depends only on the higher packing fraction ( @xmath272 , whereas @xmath194 for hard spheres ) .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that we also performed md simulations with different @xmath74 values ( @xmath273 and 3 ) , and tested variants of the sa with alternative choices for @xmath122 ( for instance , @xmath274 , or @xmath275 . only very small changes of peak heights were found in all cases .",
    "this relative insensitiveness to the well depths may perhaps be explained by the well known fact that at high packing fractions the structure depends essentially on the repulsive part of potentials , while the attractive forces sensibly affect only thermodynamics .",
    "an improved sa could be obtained by replacing @xmath276 in eq .",
    "( [ sagr ] ) with @xmath277 .",
    "this choice would be akin to the `` mean density approximation'',@xcite used for binary lj mixtures.@xcite however , we have not attempted its application to polydisperse fluids , since it would require the evaluation of @xmath278 at many different reduced temperatures , which is inconvenient when ies have to be solved numerically . in the particular case of the lj potential one could take advantage of an explicit analytical parametrization for the rdf proposed by goldman.@xcite",
    "this extension goes beyond the scope of the present paper and might be the subject of future work .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the structure of simple polydisperse fluids can be successfully predicted by integral equation methods , even when no analytical solution is available and a numerical one is unpracticable because of the very large number of components .",
    "we have obtained rather accurate structure factors by solving ies for appropriate pure fluids and applying a recipe based upon a corresponding states approach , which assumes conformality of all rdfs in the polydisperse mixture .",
    "thus the hypothesis that all rdfs have essentially the same shape , but are scaled with respect to each other , turns out to be physically sound .",
    "the good performance of the scaling approximation for rather concentrated systems is due to a correct treatment of excluded volumes .",
    "this feature appears to be lacking in both the decoupling approximation and the local monodisperse approximation , when these are reformulated in terms of pair correlation functions .",
    "the importance of evaluating the properties of the reference pure fluid at exactly the same packing fraction of the mixture is also to be emphasized .",
    "this condition is not satisfied by the very similar vdw1 approximation .",
    "a shortcoming of sa is certainly the equality of all rdfs at contact , but this error appears to be a higher order effect , at least at high packing fractions .    in conclusion , the proposed sa approximation offers to small angle scattering experimentalists a simple and valuable tool to predict structure factors or to fit data , and has proved superior to both da and lma .",
    "we have shown that the sa is applicable to different potentials for nonionic fluids .",
    "an extension of sa to polydisperse ionic mixtures will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
