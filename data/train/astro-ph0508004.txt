    "the deliberate search for and study of solar analogs has been ongoing for nearly 30 years , initiating with the seminal early works of hardorp ( e.g. , hardorp 1978 ) .",
    "@xcite gives an authoritative review of this early history , many photometric and spectroscopic results , and the astrophysical motivations for studying solar analogs .",
    "as of a decade ago , these motivations were of a strong fundamental and utilitarian nature , seeking answers to such questions as : ( a ) what is the solar color ?",
    "b ) how well do photometric indices predict spectroscopic properties ?",
    "c ) how robust are spectral types at describing or predicting the totality of a stellar spectrum ?",
    "d ) are there other stars that can be used as exact photometric and/or spectroscopic proxies for the sun in the course of astrophysical research programs ?    while these important questions remain incompletely answered and of great interest , the study of solar analogs and search for solar twins has taken on renewed importance .",
    "much of this has been driven by the detection of planetary companions around solar - type stars ; the impact of these detections on solar analog research was foreshadowed with great prescience by @xcite .",
    "precision radial velocity searches for exoplanets are most robust when applied to slowly rotating and inactive stars ; solar analogs are thus fruitful targets  metal - rich ones apparently even more fruitful @xcite .",
    "the appeal in searching for elusive terrestrial exoplanets around solar analogs remains a natural one given the existence of our own solar system .",
    "solar analogs of various age also provide a mechanism to examine the past and future evolution of the sun without significant or total recourse to stellar models .",
    "such efforts looking at the sun in time @xcite now appear to be critical complements to studying the evolution of planets and life surrounding solar - type stars .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that solar - type stars may be subject to highly energetic superflare outbursts , perhaps induced by orbiting planets , that would have dramatic effects on atmospheres surrounding and lifeforms inhabiting orbiting planets @xcite .",
    "it also seems clear that the nominal non - stochastic gradual evolution of solar - type chromospheres has important implications for a diversity of planetary physics ( in our own solar system and others ) : the structure and chemistry of planetary atmospheres , the water budget on mars , and even the evolution of planetary surfaces @xcite ; such issues are critical ones to understand in the development and evolution of life .    the utilitarian importance of studying solar analogs has also persisted . for example , there should be little argument that differential spectroscopic analyses performed relative to the sun are most reliable when applied to stars like the sun early g dwarfs .",
    "happily , such objects can be found in a large variety of stellar populations having an extreme range of metallicity and age .",
    "the development of large aperture telescopes and improved instrumentation such as multi - object spectrographs and wide field imagers over the next decade or so mean that the stellar astronomy community is poised to undertake abundance surveys of tens or hundreds of thousands of galactic stars .",
    "critical questions confronting such ambitious but inevitable initiatives include :  a ) how reliable are photometric metallicities ?",
    "b ) can low - resolution spectroscopy yield results as robust as those from high - resolution spectroscopy ?",
    "c ) will automated spectroscopic analyses needed to handle such large datasets yield reliable results ? all these questions can be addressed well by comparison with the results of high - resolution spectroscopy of solar analogs .    despite the importance of carrying out high - resolution spectroscopic analyses of solar analogs ,",
    "efforts at doing so have been deliberate in pace .",
    "recent exceptions to this include the solar analog studies of @xcite and @xcite . here , we present the first results from a small contribution aimed at remedying this pace of study . using the results of dr .",
    "d.  soderblom s recent chromospheric h & k survey of nearby ( @xmath4 pc ) late - f to early - k dwarfs in the _ hipparcos _ catalog , we have selected a sample of poorly - studied solar twin candidates having @xmath5 , chromospheric fluxes within a few tenths of a dex of the mean solar value , and @xmath6 within a few tenths of a magnitude of the solar value ; there are roughly 150 such objects accessible from the northern hemisphere .",
    "these objects have been or are being observed as time allows during other observing programs . here , we present echelle spectroscopy of 4 candidates obtained with keck / hires .",
    "the objects are hip 71813 , 76114 , 77718 , and 78399 .",
    "our 4 solar twin candidates were observed on ut july 8 2004 using the keck i 10-m , its hires echelle spectrograph , and a tektronix @xmath7 ccd detector . the chosen slit width and cross - disperser setting yielded spectra from 4475 to 6900  at a resolution of @xmath8 .",
    "exposure times ranged from 3 to @xmath9 minutes , achieving per pixel s / n in the continuum near 6707  of @xmath10 .",
    "a log of the observations containing cross - identifications is presented in table 1 .",
    "standard reductions were carried out including debiasing , flat - fielding , order identification / tracing / extraction , and wavelength calibration ( via solutions calculated for an internal th - ar lamp ) .",
    "the h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 features are located at the blue edge of their respective orders ; the lack of surrounding wavelength coverage with which to accomplish continuum normalization thus prevented us from using balmer profile fitting to independently determine @xmath0 .",
    "samples of the spectra in the @xmath13 region can be found later in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "clean , `` case a '' and lines from the list of @xcite were selected for measurement in our 4 solar twin candidate spectra and a similarly high s / n and @xmath8 keck / hires lunar spectrum ( described in @xcite ) used as a solar proxy spectrum .",
    "equivalent widths were measured using the profile fitting routines in the 1-d spectrum analysis software package spectre @xcite .",
    "line strengths of all the features measured in each star and our solar proxy spectrum can be found in table 2 .",
    "abundances were derived from the equivalent widths using the 2002 version of the lte analysis package moog and kurucz model atmospheres interpolated from atlas9 grids .",
    "oscillator strengths were taken from @xcite ; the accuracy of these is irrelevant inasmuch as normalized abundances [ x / h ] were formed on a line - by - line basis using solar abundances derived in the same manner .",
    "the solar model atmosphere was characterized by @xmath14 k , log @xmath15 , a metallicity of [ m / h]=0 . , and a microturbulent velocity of @xmath16 ; the latter is intermediate to the values of @xmath17 from the calibrations of @xcite and @xcite . an enhancement factor of 2.2 was applied to the van der waals broadening coefficients for all lines .",
    "stellar parameters were determined as part of the fe analysis in the usual fashion . @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath17 were determined by requiring zero correlation coefficient between the _ solar normalized _ abundances ( i.e. , [ fe / h ] ; again , accomplished on a line - by - line basis ) and the lower excitation potential and reduced equivalent width , respectively .",
    "this approach leads to unique solutions when there is no underlying correlation between excitation potential and reduced equivalent width .",
    "we show in figure 1 that there is no such underlying correlation in our sample .",
    "figure 2 displays the -based line - by - line [ fe / h ] values versus both lower excitation potential ( top ) and reduced equivalent width ( bottom ) using our final model atmosphere parameters for the case of hip 76114 ; the linear correlation coefficients in both planes are @xmath18 .",
    "our abundance analysis is thus a purely differential one , and the derived parameters do not depend on the rigorous accuracy of the @xmath19 values .",
    "the 1@xmath20 level uncertainties in @xmath0 and @xmath17 were determined by finding the values of these parameters where the respective correlation coefficients became significant at the 1@xmath21 confidence level .",
    "gravity estimates were made via ionization balance of fe .",
    "the error estimates for log @xmath22 include uncertainties in both [ /h ] and [ /h ] due to measurement uncertainty , @xmath0 errors , and @xmath17 errors .",
    "the final parameters and their uncertainties can be found in the summary of results in table 4 .",
    "abundances of al , ca , ti , and ni were derived in a similar fashion using the line data in table 2 and model atmospheres characterized by the parameters determined from the fe data .",
    "abundances of a given species were normalized on a line - by - line basis using the values derived from the solar spectrum , and then averaged together .",
    "typical errors in the mean are only 0.01 - 0.02 dex , indicative of the quality of the data .",
    "the sensitivity of the derived abundances to arbitrarily selected fiducial variations in the stellar parameters ( @xmath23 k in @xmath0 ; @xmath24 dex in log @xmath22 ; and @xmath24 km s@xmath25 in microturbulence ) are provided for each element in table 3 .",
    "coupling these with the parameter uncertainties and the statistical uncertainties in the mean yielded total uncertainties in the abundance ratio of each element .",
    "the mean abundances and the @xmath26 uncertainties are given in table 4 .",
    "o abundances were derived from the measured equivalent widths of the @xmath27 [ o i ] feature ( table 2 ) using the blends package in moog to account for contamination by a feature at 6300.34 .",
    "isotopic components @xcite of ni were taken into account with the @xmath19 values taken from @xcite ; the [ o i ] @xmath19 value ( -9.717 ) is taken from @xcite .",
    "the assumed ni abundances were taken as [ ni / h]=0.00 , -0.04 , -0.16 , and -0.01 for hip 71813 , 76114 , 77718 , and 78399 respectively .",
    "abundances are given in table 4 .",
    "uncertainties in [ o / h ] are dominated by those in the equivalent widths ( @xmath28 m ) measurements of the stars and the sun , and that in log @xmath22 ( @xmath29 dex ) .",
    "these uncertainties from these 3 sources were added in quadrature to yield the total uncertainties associated with the [ o / h ] values given in table 4 .",
    "li abundances were derived from the @xmath13 resonance features via spectrum synthesis . utilizing",
    "the derived parameters , synthetic spectra of varying li abundance were created in moog using the line list from @xcite . no contribution from @xmath30li",
    "was assumed , a reasonable assumption given that the li abundances in our objects are well - below meteoritic ( log @xmath31(li)=3.31 ; @xmath30li/@xmath32li@xmath33 ) .",
    "smoothing was carried out by convolving the synthetic spectra with gaussians having fwhm values measured from clean , weak lines measured in our spectra .",
    "comparison of the syntheses ( solid lines ) and the keck / hires spectra in the @xmath13 region are shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "total uncertainties include those due to uncertainties in the @xmath0 value ( table 3 ) and in the fit itself .",
    "the li results are listed in table 4 .",
    "the same fwhm values measured for each star and used to smooth the syntheses were assumed to be the quadrature sum of components due to spectrograph resolution and ( twice the projected ) rotational velocity . the resulting @xmath34 sin @xmath35 values are listed in table 4 .",
    "inasmuch as we assume no contribution from macroturbulent broadening mechanisms , we present these estimates as upper limits to the projected rotational velocity . the h&k chromospheric emission indices of our objects are listed in table 4 and come from the low - resolution ( @xmath36 ) kpno coude feed - based survey of d.  soderblom .",
    "masses and ages of the sun and our four solar twin candidates were estimated by placing them in the @xmath6 versus @xmath0 plane using our temperature estimates and the hipparcos - based absolute visual magnitudes .",
    "comparison of these positions with isochrones and sequences of constant mass taken from appropriate metallicity yonsei - yale isochrones @xcite ( as updated by @xcite ) yielded the mass and age estimates in table 4 .",
    "the uncertainties in mass and age are calculated assuming the influence of uncertainties in our @xmath0 and @xmath6 values ; including the uncertainty in our metallicity estimates ( @xmath37 dex ) has a negligible effect on the uncertainty of our estimated masses , but would contribute an additional 0.4 gyr uncertainty in the age estimates .",
    "the hr diagrams containing our objects and these isochrones are shown in figure 5 .",
    "hip 71813 is included in the recent geneva - copenhagen solar neighborhood survey of @xcite .",
    "their photometric metallicity determination of [ fe / h]@xmath38 is in outstanding agreement with our al , ca , ti , fe , and ni abundances , which range from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "their photometric @xmath0 estimate of 5662 k is some 90 k lower than our spectroscopic value .",
    "if the solar color , @xmath41 , adopted in table 4 is to be believed , then our @xmath0 value would seem to be more consistent with the nearly indistinguishable @xmath42 index ( 0.644 ) of hip 71813 .",
    "hip 76114 is also included in the geneva - copenhagen survey .",
    "the @xcite photometric metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath43 is also in outstanding agreement with our al , ca , ti , fe , and ni abundances , which range from @xmath44 to @xmath39 .",
    "the photometric @xmath0 difference between hip 71813 and 76114 ( former minus latter ) of 52 k is in excellent agreement with our spectroscopic difference of 40 k.    hip 77718 has a photometric metallicity , [ fe / h]@xmath45 from the @xcite solar neighborhood survey that is in good agreement with our al , ti , fe , and ni determinations , which range from @xmath46 to @xmath47 ; our [ ca / h ] abundance of @xmath48 appears only mildly anomalous in comparison .",
    "the hip 77718 minus 71813 photometric @xmath0 difference of 92 k is in outstanding agreement with the 90 k spectroscopic difference . @xcite",
    "have determined the parameters and overall abundance of hip 77718 via the analysis of low resolution blue spectra as part of their nstar survey .",
    "the independent spectroscopic @xmath0 estimate , made via different comparisons of different spectral features in a different part of the spectrum , of 5859 k is only 19 k larger than our own and 105 k larger than the photometric value .",
    "the @xcite metallicity of [ m / h]@xmath49 is indistinguishable from our own result .",
    "hip 78399 has not been subjected to any published abundance or high - resolution spectroscopic analysis that we are aware of .",
    "accordingly , it lacks a radial velocity determination .",
    "we remedied this by determining a radial velocity relative to hip 76114 via cross - correlation of the spectra in the 6160 - 6173  range .",
    "we assumed the precision radial velocity of @xmath50 km / s from @xcite for hip 76114 .",
    "cross - correlation of the telluric b - band spectra in the 6880  region revealed a 9.9 km / s offset between the spectra . while larger than anticipated , this intra - night drift was confirmed by comparison of telluric water vapor features in the 6300  region .",
    "accounting for this drift and the appropriate relative heliocentric corrections , we find a radial velocity of @xmath51 km / s for hip 78399 .",
    "@xcite included hip71813 as a member of the wolf 630 moving group .",
    "membership in this putative kinematic population was defined by eggen in a vast series papers as traced in the work of @xcite .",
    "regardless of one s view on the reality of these kinematic assemblages , it is likely that the recent passing of o.  eggen has meant that a wealth of modern data ( in particular _ hipparcos _",
    "parallaxes and precision radial velocities ) has not yet been brought to bear on the reality , properties , and detailed membership of the wolf 630 group .",
    "a notable exception is the work of @xcite , who find a clustering of late - type stars at @xmath52 km s@xmath25 that is absent in the kinematic phase space of their early - type stellar sample ; this is highly suggestive of an old moving group at eggen s suggested position of the wolf 630 group in the bottlinger ( @xmath53,@xmath54 ) diagram .",
    "the salient characteristics identified by eggen for the wolf 630 group are a ) a kinematically old disk population , b ) a characteristic galactic rotational velocity of @xmath55 km / s , and c ) a color - luminosity array similar to m 67 .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to revisit or refine characteristics of the wolf 630 group .",
    "however , several notes can be made .",
    "first , our 8 gyr age estimate for hip 71813 is certainly consistent with an old disk object .",
    "second , if the estimate of @xcite of [ fe / h]@xmath56 for the wolf 630 group metallicity is accurate , then hip 71813 would not seem to be a member .",
    "third , using _ hipparcos _ parallaxes and proper motions , and modern radial velocity determinations @xcite , the @xmath2 kinematics of hip 71813 can be compared with those of wolf 629 , a wolf 630 group defining member according to eggen .",
    "the heliocentric galactic velocities of all our objects are listed in table 4 .",
    "the ( u , v)=(+21.3@xmath57,-36.3@xmath58 ) results for hip 71813 are in excellent agreement with those for wolf 629 ( + 21.0@xmath58,-33.4@xmath59 ) , and consistent with the canonical wolf 630 group values ( 26 , -33 ) given by @xcite",
    ". none of our other candidate solar twins has kinematics , which are listed in table 4 , consistent with those of the wolf 630 group .",
    "_ hip 71813_. the @xmath0 value , light metal - abundances , and chromospheric emission of hip 71813 are indistinguishable from solar values . the li abundance , however , appears to be depleted by a factor of @xmath60 compared to the sun .",
    "more importantly , however , the star appears significantly more evolved than the sun .",
    "the @xmath6 and log @xmath22 values are significantly lower than the solar values , and our estimated age is a factor of 2 older than the sun s . while clearly an inappropriate solar twin candidate , the star would appear to be an excellent solar analog of significantly older age .",
    "_ hip 76114_. hip 76114 is marginally cooler than the sun , @xmath61 k. while any of the light element abundances alone are indistinguishable from solar , taken together they suggest a metallicity some 0.04 dex lower than solar ; this is confirmed by the photometric metallicity of @xcite .",
    "the emission and li abundance is solar within the uncertainties , but the star appears marginally evolved relative to the sun as indicated by its slightly lower @xmath6 and log @xmath22 values ; table 4 suggests that hip 76114 is @xmath62 gyr older than the sun .",
    "this object may be a suitable solar analog of slightly older age , albeit of likely slightly lower metallicity , that can be included in studies looking at solar evolution .",
    "_ hip 77718_. while the chromospheric emission and age determination of hip 77718 are observationally indistinguishable from the sun , our analysis indicates this star is clearly warmer ( @xmath63 k ) and some 0.16 dex metal - poor relative to solar ; both the warmer temperature and slightly metal - poor nature are independently confirmed by the spectroscopic analysis of @xcite .",
    "the li abundance is some 20 times higher than solar .",
    "this difference may be related to reduced pms li depletion due to lower metallicity or reduced main - sequence depletion due to a younger age ; our observations can not distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "regardless , this star is not a good solar twin candidate , nor an optimal metal - poor or younger solar analog .",
    "_ hip 78399_. the poorly - studied hip 78399 appears to hold great promise as a solar twin candidate .",
    "its @xmath0 , luminosity , mass , age , light metal abundances , and rotational velocity are all indistinguishable from solar values .",
    "the only marked difference seen is the li abundance , which is a factor of @xmath9 larger than the solar photospheric abundance .",
    "while the evolution of li depletion in solar - type stars is a complex and still incompletely understood process subject to vigorous investigation , this difference may suggest a slightly younger age for hip 78399 , which is allowed by our age determination and may be consistent with a slightly larger chromospheric flux .",
    "currently , the `` closest ever solar twin '' title belongs to hr 6060 @xcite .",
    "several spectroscopic analyses of this star have been carried out @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 estimates range from 5693 to 5835 k , and [ fe / h ] estimates from 0.06 to + 0.05 ; the precision @xmath0 analysis using line ratios @xcite indicates a @xmath0 difference with respect to the sun of 17 k. the h&k emission index ( -5.00 , gray 1995 ) and rotational velocity ( @xmath64 km / s , de mello & da silva 1997 ) are indistinguishable from solar values .",
    "hipparcos_-based absolute magnitude strongly suggests the mass and age of hr 6060 are virtually identical to the sun s @xcite . just as for hip 78399 ,",
    "the only glaring outlying parameter is li abundance , which is a factor of @xmath65 larger than the solar photospheric li abundance @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite on 1 @xmath66 stars in the solar - age and -abundance cluster m67 suggests that we can expect such objects to exhibit a @xmath67 dex range in li ; thus , the sun may not be an especially good li `` standard '' .",
    "based on our analysis , we believe there is a case to be made that hip 78399 share the stage with hr 6060 as the closest ever solar twin . for those engaged in studies of solar twins or the sun in time , hip 78399 is certainly worthy of closer follow - up study . particularly valuable",
    "would be : a ) refining its t@xmath68 and luminosity estimates relative to the sun via balmer line profile fitting , analysis of line ratios , etc .",
    "b ) analysis of the @xmath69 lines to confirm whether its o abundance is truly subsolar , c ) performing an independent check on its relative age via the [ th / nd ] ratio @xcite , and d ) determining a @xmath70be abundance , which is more immune to the effects of stellar depletion and also contains embedded information about the `` personal '' integrated galactic cosmic - ray history of matter comprised by the star .",
    "we have carried out high s / n high - resolution keck / hires spectroscopy of four candidate solar twins drawn from a",
    "_ hipparcos_-defined h&k survey .",
    "parameters , abundances , masses , ages , and kinematics have been derived in a differential fine analysis .",
    "comparisons suggests that the _ relative _ photometric @xmath0 values of @xcite and our spectroscopic temperatures are indistinguishably robust ; however , the photometric @xmath0 values are typically 100 k cooler .",
    "there are several lines of evidence that suggest the photometric scale is misanchored ( at least near solar @xmath0 ) .",
    "first , if the solar color of @xcite is nearly correct , then our spectroscopic @xmath0 values are in outstanding accord with the colors of hip 71813 and 78399 .",
    "second , the independent analysis of hip 77718 by @xcite using different spectral features in the blue yields a spectroscopic @xmath0 in outstanding agreement with our own .",
    "third , the @xcite photometric @xmath0 estimate for the `` closest ever solar twin '' hr 6060 is 5688 k , some @xmath71 k lower than the precision @xmath0 estimate of @xcite .    at the same time , our light metal - abundances are in excellent agreement with the photometric metallicity estimates for the 3 of our objects in @xcite , differing by no more than a few hundredths of a dex .",
    "there is no sign of the abnormally low photometric metallicity values seen for some very cool pop i dwarfs in the hyades and uma group as noted by @xcite .",
    "as these authors note , anomalous photometric estimates may be restricted to late g dwarfs .",
    "our spectroscopic metallicity for hip 77718 is in nearly exact agreement with that derived from low - resolution blue spectra by @xcite .",
    "we present the first abundances and radial velocity estimate for hip 78399 . using the radial velocities and _ hipparcos _ proper motions and parallaxes",
    ", we derive the @xmath2 kinematics of our four solar twin candidates .",
    "the position of hip 71813 in the @xmath72 plane is consistent with membership in eggen s wolf 630 moving group , a kinematic structure of late - type _ hipparcos _ stars apparently verified by @xcite .",
    "our metallicity for hip 71813 , [ fe / h]@xmath73 , is 0.1 dex higher than the wolf 630 estimate of @xcite , however . revisiting the characteristic metallicity via identification of assured wolf 630 group members using _ hipparcos _ data and new precision radial velocities , and follow - up high resolution spectroscopy to determine abundances would be of great value .",
    "hip 77718 is @xmath74 k warmer than the sun , significantly more metal - poor ( [ m / h]@xmath75 ) , significantly more li - rich ( log @xmath31(li)@xmath76 ) and a few percent lass massive than the sun ; we deem it neither a suitable solar twin nor solar analog to trace the evolution of the sun .",
    "the light - metal and li abundances of hip 76114 are much closer to solar",
    ". however , hip 76114 does appear to be slightly metal - poor ( [ m / h]@xmath77 ) , cooler @xmath78 k , older @xmath79 gyr , and a few percent less massive compared to the sun .",
    "hip 71813 appears to be an excellent solar analog of solar abundance , mass , and @xmath0 , but advanced age@xmath80 and @xmath81 gyr ; the more evolved state of this star is likely reflected in the subsolar upper limit to its li abundance .",
    "finally , our first ever analysis of hip 78399 suggests this object may be a solar twin candidate of quality comparable to the `` closest ever solar twin '' hr 6060 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 , mass , age , and light metal abundances of this object are indistinguishable from solar given the uncertainties .",
    "the only obvious difference is that which characterizes hr 6060 as well a li abundance a factor of a few larger than the solar photospheric value .",
    "this object merits additional study as a solar twin to refine its parameters ; of particular interest will be confirming our subsolar o abundance derived from the very weak @xmath27 [ ] feature .",
