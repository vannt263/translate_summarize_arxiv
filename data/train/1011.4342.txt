    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) show very complicated time profiles and , despite extensive investigations , are still not fully understood .",
    "the fourier power density spectrum ( pds ) of grbs , on the other hand , seem to show relatively simple behavior .",
    "@xcite found that a typical pds shows a low - frequency power - law component and a high - frequency flat component ( usually associated with poisson noise ) .",
    "@xcite considered each grb as a realization of some common stochastic process and showed that when averaged over many bursts the resulting pds exhibits a power - law behavior with an exponent of -1.67 , which the authors note is consistent with the -5/3 kolmogorov spectral index expected from processes involving turbulent flow .",
    "in addition , they claim that there is a break in the averaged pds at @xmath4 1 hz . the authors were not in a position to correct their sample for the time dilation due to the cosmological redshifts .",
    "@xcite analyzed grb power spectra by dividing them into six luminosity bins using the variability - luminosity correlation  @xcite .",
    "the pds was averaged in each bin after correcting for pseudo - redshifts obtained through the variability - luminosity relation  @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the dominant frequency ( @xmath5 ) of the pds is strongly correlated with the variability parameter obtained by taking a modified variance of the de - trended light curve  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath5 is obtained by finding the maximum of the function @xmath6@xmath7 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the author further states that the red - noise component of the averaged pds for the six luminosity bins is well described by a broken power - law function with a low - frequency slope of -2/3 and high - frequency slope of -2 . in this case , the break frequency is a function of both luminosity and the variability parameter .",
    "@xcite did a similar analysis of power spectra but used measured redshift information to correct for time dilation effects before averaging .",
    "the burst sample was subdivided into two populations based on the calculated values of the autocorrelation function .",
    "after averaging , the pds of one population shows a power - law index of @xmath4 -2.0 ( consistent with the spectral index expected of brownian motion ) and the pds of the other population is characterized by a low - frequency exponentially decaying component and a high - frequency power - law component with an index of @xmath4 -1.6 ( which again is consistent with the -5/3 kolmogorov spectral index ) .",
    "most of the previous work on power density spectra of grbs has been based on observations with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the compton gamma ray observatory @xcite where a relatively modest amount of redshift information is available .",
    "the launch of the @xmath8 satellite  @xcite ushered in a new era of grb research .",
    "due to its rapidly disseminated , arcsecond grb positions , @xmath8 has enabled more subsequent redshift measurements of grbs than ever before .",
    "the availability of redshift information enables the study of rest - frame properties of bursts and provides an opportunity for further exploration of correlations involving burst parameters such as luminosity and variability .    in this paper",
    "we present a study of fourier power density spectra of 206 @xmath8 long bursts .",
    "unlike previous work , we avoid averaging pds of multiple bursts and examine them individually .",
    "we have developed a method to estimate the uncertainties in pds for each burst .",
    "then we extract pds for all the grbs in the sample and investigate the distribution of the extracted parameters .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section  [ data_analysis ] we discuss our methodology for extracting the pds . in section  [ results ] , we present our results for a sample of 206 long bursts and investigate various correlations between the extracted parameters . in addition , we propose a new frequency - luminosity relation based on a sample of 58 grbs with spectroscopically measured redshifts . in section  [ discussion ]",
    ", we discuss observational biases of our results .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusion ] we summarize our conclusions . in this work , we have adopted the standard values for the cosmological parameters : @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the hubble constant @xmath11 is @xmath12 . throughout this paper ,",
    "the quoted uncertainties are at the 68% confidence level , unless noted otherwise .",
    "@xmath8 bat is a highly sensitive , coded aperture instrument  @xcite .",
    "bat uses the shadow pattern resulting from the coded mask to facilitate few arc - minute localization of gamma - ray sources . in order to generate background",
    "subtracted light curves , we used a process called mask weighting .",
    "the mask weighting assigns a ray - traced shadow value for each individual event , which then enables the user to calculate light curves or spectra .",
    "we used the ` batmaskwtevt ` and ` batbinevt ` tasks in the @xmath8 bat ftools to generate mask weighted , background - subtracted light curves in the bat energy range @xmath13 kev .",
    "the light curves that are generated have rates that are measured in counts per second per detector ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "in addition , the above tools also generate uncertainties associated with the rates that are calculated by propagation of errors from raw counts ( subject to poissonian noise ) . for",
    "the bat instrument one can potentially go down to the minimum time binning of @xmath4 0.1 ms .",
    "however , in this work , we used 1-ms time binned light curves .",
    "we calculate the fourier transform , @xmath15 , of each grb light curve , @xmath16 ( measured in counts / sec / detector ) , using a standard fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "we used a time segment of the burst light - curve where the total fluence is accumulated ( i.e. start and end times corresponding to burst t100 which is calculated by the ` battblocks ` task ) .",
    "the pds of each burst is calculated using @xmath17 .",
    "the power spectra are not normalized nor are they averaged . in addition , we have employed logarithmic binning for our power spectra .",
    "this process of treating pds individually is different from that of @xcite and @xcite , as they used some averaging process to obtain the slope of the red - noise component of the power spectra .",
    "the wide variety of light curves exhibited by grbs is potentially indicative of different emission and scattering processes that eventually shape the observed light curves and therefore we have avoided averaging power spectra so as not to compromise this valuable information .",
    "the uncertainties of the individual pds are calculated as follows : for each burst , we simulate 100 light curves based on the original light curve ( @xmath18 ) and its uncertainty ( @xmath19 ) , i.e. @xmath20 here @xmath21 is a random number generated from a gaussian distribution with the mean equal to zero and the standard deviation equal to one .",
    "for each simulated light curve we calculate a pds . then we re - bin each pds logarithmically . the uncertainties in the original pds",
    "( obtained from the original light curve ) are derived by taking the standard deviation of the 100 simulated pds .",
    "the power spectra for the grbs in the sample are fitted with the function depicted in equation  [ eq : no2 ] ( see figure  [ power_spectrum ] for a typical fit ) .",
    "this function consists of a power - law component ( to fit the low - frequency `` red noise '' component ) and a constant component ( to fit the flat high - frequency `` white noise '' component ) .",
    "@xmath22 here @xmath1 is the threshold frequency where the red - noise component intersects the white - noise component of the power density spectrum , and @xmath23 is the white - noise power density .",
    "out of 451 grbs which triggered @xmath8 bat from 2004 december 19 to 2009 december 31 , we selected a sample of 226 long grbs that show a significant red - noise component above the flat white - noise region . in figure",

    "presumably , the ` red - noise ' component of the pds comes primarily from the grb but the flat ` white - noise ' component can in principle arise from the poisson noise ( intensity fluctuations ) associated with the grb and the natural background in the field - of - view of the detector .",
    "for distant and/or intrinsically weak bursts , noise unrelated to the burst may dominate the observed white - noise component , thereby overwhelming the red - noise part of the signal .",
    "this , in turn , would make the extraction of the threshold frequency brightness - dependent . in figure  [ freqvsbrightness ]",
    "we plot the peak photon flux and the photon fluence as a function of the threshold frequency .",
    "the red dashed line in the top panel of figure  [ freqvsbrightness ] is the best fit , given by equation  [ eq : no3.5 ] , and blue dotted lines indicate a @xmath46 confidence interval . @xmath47 indeed , a positive correlation can be seen between @xmath1 and the peak photon flux .",
    "however , no significant correlation is observed between @xmath1 and fluence .",
    "we discus this important matter further in the next section .",
    "it is conceivable that the proposed frequency - luminosity correlation is a direct result of the observed correlation between @xmath1 and the peak photon flux of the burst ( see the top panel of figure  [ freqvsbrightness ] ) .",
    "if this is the case , then for a statistically significant sample of bursts with similar apparent brightness , we should not see a correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath39 . in order to select a sample of grbs with similar apparent brightness we plot in figure  [ ppf_histogram ] the peak photon flux distribution for the sample of 58 bursts used to investigate the frequency - luminosity correlation in figure  [ fth_vs_liso ] .",
    "we see from figure  [ ppf_histogram ] that about half of the sample ( 28 grbs ) have a very similar peak photon flux ( 0.0 @xmath48 ( peak photon flux ) @xmath49 0.5 ) . for this subset of bursts",
    "we plotted their peak photon flux and @xmath39 as a function of @xmath30 and the results are shown in figure  [ fth_ppf_freq ] . in the top panel of figure  [ fth_ppf_freq ] , it is clear that there is a significant correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath50 with correlation coefficient of @xmath51 .",
    "this implies that the correlation observed in figure  [ fth_vs_liso ] ( @xmath31 - @xmath39 correlation ) is not entirely due to the correlation seen in the top panel of figure  [ freqvsbrightness ] ( @xmath52peak photon flux correlation ) .",

    "the size of the star is proportional to the redshift of the burst.,width=317 ]    in addition , we can approach the issue from the other direction , i.e. , we select a subset of bursts with similar luminosity and ask the question whether the correlation between peak photon flux and @xmath1 comes from the proposed @xmath31 - @xmath50 correlation . in order to perform this test we selected a subset of bursts which have the roughly the same @xmath39 values ( 51.5 @xmath54 52.5 ) and plotted their peak photon flux as a function of @xmath1 . in figure",
    "[ fth_ppf_const_liso ] , we show the peak photon flux as a function of @xmath1 ( top panel ) and the redshift corrected @xmath1 ( bottom panel ) . there is clearly a strong correlation between the two parameters in both panels .",
    "it is interesting , however , that after the redshift correction , the correlation strength drops significantly .",
    "accordingly , it would appear that the correlation between the peak photon flux and @xmath1 ( top panel of figure  [ freqvsbrightness ] ) is not entirely due to the @xmath31 - @xmath39 correlation ( figure  [ fth_vs_liso ] ) .",
    "since the spectral power is proportional to the square of the flux and the pds follows a @xmath55 behavior ( see figure  [ fft_alpha_histogram ] ) , we expect to see a correlation between peak photon flux and @xmath30 . hence , this correlation is in most part observational .",

    "the obvious question is how to determine the noise - level for each burst .",
    "one way of defining the noise - level is the following :    @xmath57    the detrending of the light curve ( lc ) can be done in a number of ways and we adopted the following method .",
    "we generated two light curves of the same burst with two bin sizes . in order to produce the coarser binned light curve",
    ", we chose a time bin size that resulted in at least 100 points in the burst duration ( t100 ) .",
    "the other light curve may have bin sizes that vary from 1 ms up to the coarser bin size .",
    "clearly , with the different binning , the two light curves will have a different number of points . in order to properly detrend ,",
    "we need to have the same number of points in the two light curves .",
    "we accomplish this by using a simple linear interpolation of the coarser binned light curve .",
    "the interpolated light curve is then subtracted from the finer binned light curve to generate the detrended light curve .",
    "using equation  [ eq : no4 ] we extract a noise level for each burst . however , the extracted noise - level depends on the bin size used in the detrending process .",
    "this aspect needs to be either removed or accounted for before the noise level of all the bursts can be treated on an equal footing .",
    "the level of the flat white - noise region of the pds does not depend on the bin size , i.e. , for a given burst the white noise level is constant irrespective of the bin size , and for that matter so too are the extracted parameters @xmath0 and @xmath30 . in order to remove the bin size dependence in the extraction of the noise - level , we modify equation  [ eq : no4 ] as follows .",
    "@xmath58 here @xmath59 is the number of data points in the finely binned light curve .",
    "our tests indicate that the results given by equation  [ eq : no5 ] do not depend on the time bin size of the light curve and provide a robust measure of the noise - level of a given burst .    in order to further investigate the dependance of @xmath1 on the noise - level , we performed additional tests .",
    "we simulated different noise levels by adding increasing amounts of gaussian noise to a burst light curve ( in this case grb 050315 ) .",
    "then we extracted @xmath1 values for each setting of the noise - level .",
    "our results , the extracted frequency values versus the noise - level , are shown in figure  [ simulated_lcs ] as a log - log plot .",
    "the threshold frequency does indeed depend on the noise - level .",
    "however , there is a linear relationship between the logarithmic values of the two quantities .",
