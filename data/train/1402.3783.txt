    "in recent years significant attention has been devoted to the development of accurate and low cost wireless localization systems for indoor civilian applications , since they can be employed to provide a number of new services , like asset tracking and tracking of people with special needs @xcite . in these services",
    "estimated positions need always to be related to a surrounding infrastructure ( e.g. , rooms and corridors ) to be useful to their end users , so that the knowledge of the map of the environment where users are expected to move ( e.g. , the plan of a building floor ) is required . in principle ,",
    "map knowledge ( i.e. , _ map - awareness _ ) can be also exploited to improve the estimation accuracy of a localization system .",
    "in fact , any wireless localization system first acquires a set of point - to - point measurements related to user position ( first step ; technology - dependent ) and then processes such measurements for _ bi - dimensional _",
    "( 2-d ) or three - dimensional position estimation by means of a proper localization technique ( second step ; technology - agnostic ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) . maps can play a significant role in the second step , since they provide information about environmental obstructions ( e.g. , walls ) which interfere with signal propagation ; however , a full exploitation of these information requires a ) the availability of _ map - aware statistical models _ for the acquired measurements and b ) the development of localization techniques explicitly based on these models .    at present",
    "the only available map - aware statistical models are the model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 6 ) ) and",
    "the model ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.11.5 ) ( also known as _ wall - attenuation _ model or _ multi - wall _ model @xcite ) ; these models have been developed for and localization systems , respectively , and are based on experimental evidence .",
    "this preliminary work shows that map - awareness can significantly improve localization accuracy by compensating for the so called _ bias _ , which is a major source of error .",
    "however , as far as we know , the accuracy and validity of the above mentioned models in real world localization systems is under - explored and , generally speaking , there is a lack of experimental results supporting them in the technical literature .",
    "in fact , most of the state - of - the - art localization methods rely on _ map - unaware models_. for instance , the well known _ log - distance propagation model _",
    "@xcite ( or , in some cases , models based on polynomial series expansions @xcite ) are adopted to relate rss to distance .",
    "similar comments hold for those models relating and to distance ; in this case additive error terms are usually represented by gaussian _ random variables _ ( rvs )",
    "* eq . ( 6 ) ) , @xcite , although more refined models accounting for propagation are also available ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that map - awareness is implicitly employed in _ fingerprinting_-based localization systems to select fingerprint locations @xcite . in those systems",
    "no statistical modelling of acquired measurements is needed ( even if combined fingerprinting / statistical approaches are possible @xcite ) ; however , extensive and time consuming measurement campaigns ( which may be very sensitive to environmental changes ) are necessary to achieve an acceptable accuracy , since the localization error of fingerprinting methods is roughly bounded by the spacing between calibration sites .",
    "the aim of this manuscript is twofold .",
    "first of all , a novel _ unified statistical map - aware model _ for , or measurements is proposed and is validated exploiting a set of rss and toa data acquired in indoor environments . secondly , the improvement in localization accuracy provided by optimal localization algorithms based on the novel map - aware modelling with respect to their counterparts relying on map - unaware modelling is quantified ; this unveils that , specially in rss systems , the accuracy improvement justifies the increased complexity of map - aware modelling .",
    "the proposed map - aware model has the following relevant features : a ) it relates the nlos bias affecting measurements to map geometrical features ; b ) it can be employed in localization systems based on ranging techniques ( i.e. , toa , tdoa and rss , but not angle of arrival @xcite ) provided that their radio signals mainly propagate through obstructions ; c ) it contains few parameters to be estimated from measurements ; d ) even if its validity is assessed for narrowband low - frequency rss measurements and for toa measurements , its use can be envisaged for other technologies , like _ wireless local area network _",
    "toa / tdoa or even non - radio - based technologies ( e.g , ultra - sound ) , since it does not rely on technology - specific properties ; e ) likelihood functions based on it can be employed in navigation systems ( where mobile agents are considered ) .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ sec : statistical_model ] , the localization system we consider is described and general statistical models for map - aware and map - unaware scenarios are proposed .",
    "specific models for rss and toa measurements , based on our experimental data , are illustrated in section [ sec : experimental_results ] . in section [ sec : accuracy_results ] map - aware and map - unaware optimal localization algorithms are derived , their performance is assessed and compared , and some indications about their computational complexity are provided .",

    "these models are illustrated in the following three paragraphs .",

    "we assume that any _ map - aware _ ( _ map - unaware _ ) localization system is endowed with the knowledge of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "note that the propagation of wireless signals ( and , consequently , localization performance ) is affected by the obstructions ( e.g. , walls ) shaping the map support @xmath24 ; in particular , an important role is played by the number of obstructions @xmath26 interposed between two arbitrary points @xmath27 and @xmath28 , both belonging to @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that an agent located at @xmath18 is connected with the @xmath29-th anchor when the of the wireless signal radiated by this anchor and received by the agent exceeds a given threshold ( i.e. , the agent s _ receiver sensitivity _ ) ; therefore , each anchor is characterized by a specific coverage region . even if the map of the environment is known , the prediction of the shape of each coverage region is not easy .",
    "for this reason , the following simple ( map - unaware ) connectivity model is adopted : the coverage region @xmath30 of the @xmath29-th anchor is a circle centered at @xmath31 and whose radius @xmath32 depends on the power radiated by the anchor itself and the propagation conditions represents a form of a priori knowledge ; when such a knowledge is unavailable , @xmath33 can be selected . ] .",

    "the number @xmath35 of observations available to the agent may differ from the number which can be predicted theoretically using the above mentioned connectivity model .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the set of indices associated with the anchors _ truly connected _ with the agent ; then , we have that @xmath37 and that , if @xmath38 , then @xmath39 . consequently",
    ", in a _ map - aware _ localization system the agent position has to be searched for inside the region @xmath40 whereas , in a _ map - unaware _ system , the agent position is expected to belong to @xmath41 finally , it is important to note that the wireless links referring to the anchors connected with an agent located at @xmath18 can be in or conditions . for this reason , the set @xmath36 can be partitioned into the subsets @xmath42 and @xmath43 containing the indices of the connected anchors in and conditions , respectively .",
    "the localization system we consider statistically infers the agent position @xmath18 from a set of @xmath35 observations ( in practice , estimated ranges ) @xmath44 extracted from the radio signals coming from the connected anchors . for an indoor environment ,",
    "such signals are affected by _",
    "multipath fading _",
    "5 ) which substantially complicates the problem of the statistical modelling of the available observations . to simplify this problem , we assume that : a ) the time interval needed to acquire all the observations is small with respect to the coherence time of the propagation scenario , so that the effects due to its _ time selectivity _ can be ignored ; b ) in toa - based systems the effects due to the _ time dispersion _ characterising the propagation scenario are mitigated transmitting wideband signals , so that multiple echoes of the signal radiated by a given anchor can be resolved by the agent ( in particular , the first path can be correctly detected ) .",
    "given such assumptions , the observation model @xmath45 characterized by additive bias and noise terms and commonly adopted in the localization literature ( e.g. , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 3 ) ) , @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",

    "it is important to point out that :    1 .",
    "the effects of _ spatial selectivity _ ( that may generate substantial fluctuations in the received power as the agent position changes ) are difficult to predict and hence have been included in the noise term , even if the availability of a simple and reliable model for spatial fading would certainly improve model accuracy .",
    "the @xmath29-th observation @xmath34 ( [ eq : z_model ] ) is generated by mapping , through a function denoted @xmath49 in the following , the physical quantity measured by the hardware ( e.g. , a rss or a toa ) into a _ range_. the function @xmath49 is derived under the assumption of los propagation , since nlos propagation conditions are accounted for by introducing the bias term @xmath47 in ( [ eq : z_model ] ) . in map - aware modelling such a term",

    "this is due to the fact that the former technique mitigates nlos bias ( which represents a major source of error ) more accurately than the latter one .",

    "note also that localization errors for both and are smaller than @xmath166 for all measurement sites except # 3 , # 8 and # 12 .",
    "this result can be explained referring to the specific case of site # 3 , for which it has been found that the large error is due to a combination of a ) an anchor placement characterized by an high _ geometric dilution of precision _",

    "2 ) , although in the scenario we consider both and perform better than the and algorithms analysed in that reference ) .",
    "this is due , in the toa case , to errors in toa estimation originating from significant multipath @xcite ; in the rss case , instead , variations originate from the spatial selectivity experienced in indoor environments .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that some additional numerical results ( e.g. , referring to the robustness of the proposed statistical models to parametric inaccuracies ) have not been included here for space limitations , but are publicly available online ( see @xcite ) .      in this paragraph",

    "unluckily , the parameter @xmath177 can not be easily related to the other parameters of the proposed strategy ( [ eq : map ] ) , since it is non - linearly related to the shape of @xmath137 ( which is non - convex and non - differentiable ) and depends strongly on the exact type of optimization method employed ( see paragraph [ sub : mapbe ] ) .",
    "as far as the map - unaware ( [ eq : ml ] ) is concerned , its overall complexity can be expressed as @xmath178 since the complexity associated with the evaluation of the likelihood @xmath142 ( [ eq : likelihood_no_maps_toa_final_exp])-([eq : likelihood_no_maps_rss_final_gaussian ] ) is @xmath179 ; note that @xmath180 denotes the overall number of times the likelihood function ( [ eq : likelihood_no_maps_toa_final_exp ] ) or ( [ eq : likelihood_no_maps_rss_final_gaussian ] ) is evaluated and , just like @xmath177 , it can not be easily related to the other parameters of the .",
    "the constraint @xmath84 appearing in ( [ eq : ml ] ) makes even more difficult obtaining a closed expression for @xmath180 ; however , it can not be neglected , specially on large maps , because : a ) the map - unaware likelihood functions ( [ eq : likelihood_no_maps_toa_final_exp])-([eq : likelihood_no_maps_rss_final_gaussian ] ) are not defined for @xmath181 ; b ) even if the likelihood domains are extended to @xmath182 , minima different from the global one are substantially less likely to be contained in the domain @xmath141 than in the whole @xmath182 space . for these reasons , constrained optimization methods capable of handling the constraint @xmath84 must be selected ( eventually employing heuristic approximations ; see paragraph [ sub : mle ] ) .",
    "the considerations illustrated above led us to the conclusion that an accurate estimation of the computational complexity of both ( [ eq : map ] ) and ( [ eq : ml ] ) requires a mixed analytical / simulative approach ; for more details , the reader is referred to @xcite , which provides an in - depth computational complexity analysis together with reduced - complexity algorithms .",
    "in this manuscript novel statistical models for map - aware indoor localization have been developed .",
    "such models are based on experimental evidence and , in particular , rely on toa uwb and low - frequency narrowband rss measurements acquired in experimental campaigns .",
    "these measurements have been exploited to a ) develop suitable parametric models for nlos bias and noise , b ) estimate the values of the parameters appearing in such models and c ) assess the accuracy of map - aware localization techniques based on the proposed models .",
    "our results have evidenced that map - aware localization techniques may significantly outperform their optimal map - unaware counterparts , even when state - of - the - art map - unaware algorithms based on los / nlos detection and mitigation are considered .",

    "<S> the accuracy of indoor wireless localization systems can be substantially enhanced by _ map - awareness _ , i.e. , by the knowledge of the map of the environment in which localization signals are acquired . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this knowledge can be exploited to cancel out , at least to some extent , the signal degradation due to propagation through physical obstructions , i.e. , to the so called _ non - line - of - sight _ bias . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be achieved by developing novel localization techniques that rely on proper map - aware statistical modelling of the measurements they process . in this manuscript a unified statistical model for the measurements acquired in map - aware localization systems based on _ time - of - arrival _ and _ received signal strength </S>",
    "<S> _ techniques is developed and its experimental validation is illustrated . finally , the accuracy of the proposed map - aware model is assessed and compared with that offered by its map - unaware counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results show that , when the quality of acquired measurements is poor , map - aware modelling can enhance localization accuracy by up to 110% in certain scenarios .    </S>",
