    "<S> a table of the fitted values for @xmath72 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is included in the supplemental information.@xcite also , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : h_kappa ] are the results for @xmath9 and @xmath10 from the spt expression  [ eq : spt - s ] and from the rosenfeld dft.@xcite the dft results agree remarkably well with the simulation results for the values of @xmath30 shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> most notable in these results is the fact that the estimates for @xmath9 for the spherical and cylindrical geometries shown in fig .  [ fig : h_kappa ] are in excellent agreement , as predicted by hadwiger s theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the spt prediction agrees well with the simulation results at low packing fractions , but underestimates @xmath9 and slightly overestimates @xmath10 at packing fractions above about 0.25 . </S>",
    "<S> note that , as mentioned earlier , the value of @xmath0 and , by extension , the hadwiger coefficients @xmath72 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 will depend upon the choice of dividing surface ; however , the hadwiger form ( eq .  [ eq : hadwiger ] ) is remains valid , albeit with modified coefficients.@xcite    above @xmath73 , however , significant deviations from the hadwiger form were found . to quantify this deviation </S>",
    "<S> , we performed a cubic and quadratic weighted least - square regression with respect to @xmath33 on the sphere and cylinder data , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the results of these calculation are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : nonhad ] . at packing fractions below 0.42 , </S>",
    "<S> the cubic coefficient ( @xmath74 ) for the spherical surface is zero within the estimated statistical error , consistent with hadwiger s theorem , but this coefficient diverges quickly from zero at packing fractions above 0.42 , indicating a significant breakdown of the hadwiger form at packing fractions approaching the freezing density ( @xmath75 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is similar for the quadratic coefficient ( @xmath58 ) for the cylindrical case ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : nonhad ] top panel)- there is one value of @xmath58 at @xmath76 that is marginally different from zero outside the error bars , but given its marginality and the small value of the coefficient , we do not view this deviation as significant . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the divergence of the non - hadwiger coefficients at high packing fraction can be seen in the inset in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gamma ] in which the excess volume , @xmath38 , is plotted for the spherical surface as a function of @xmath30 for @xmath77 and 0.5 . at high @xmath30 , the excess volume @xmath78 for the planar wall ( @xmath67 ) exhibits a downward curvature that is not present in the other values of @xmath1 , making it impossible to fit @xmath79 purely as a quadratic polynomial in @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that this anomalous decrease in @xmath38 for the planar wall is connected to the prefreezing transition that has been observed for the hard - sphere fluid at a hard planar wall at high packing fraction@xcite , and further analysis is underway .    </S>",
    "<S> these results also indicate that the errors in the spt at the intermediate packing fractions are not likely to be due to the omission of higher - order terms ( beyond the quadratic for the sphere ) in @xmath33 , as has been proposed ( see ref .   for a review ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results here put severe upper bounds on the magnitude of any such higher - order terms . as an example , </S>",
    "<S> our calculated value for @xmath0 at @xmath80 and @xmath81 is 0.6595(6 ) . the corresponding spt value from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : spt - s ] is 0.6711 - a difference of 0.0116(6 ) , which is more than an order of magnitude larger than the estimated upper bound to the contribution of the cubic term @xmath74 at this packing fraction from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : nonhad ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that largest contribution to the difference comes from @xmath72 , the value for the planar wall .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated the curvature dependence of the interfacial free energy between hard - sphere fluid and hard spherical and cylindrical colloidal particles of varying radius , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations have important applications in determining the solvation free energy of nanoscale objects . from our simulation results </S>",
    "<S> , we have verified that the predictions of hadwiger s theorem,@xcite which predicts that @xmath0 for fluids at a bounding surface , under certain restrictions , is completely described by a linear combination of the average mean and gaussian curvatures , are valid for the systems studied at low to moderate fluid packing fractions ( @xmath82 ) and have calculated the coefficients of this linear combination ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) as functions @xmath30 . for these packing fractions , the hadwiger form for @xmath0 ( eq .  [ eq : hadwiger ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is shown to be valid for both convex spherical and cylindrical surfaces even down to @xmath83 , where the radius of the bounding surface is equal to that of the fluid particles . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , earlier dft results based on rosenfeld s fundamental measure theory are found to be in excellent agreement with the results of the current simulations . at higher packing fractions @xmath84 , however , significant deviations from the hadwiger form are observed . </S>",
    "<S> the results of these simulations can serve as a useful reference model to determine the thermodynamics of the hydrophobic solvation of nanoscale particles . </S>"
