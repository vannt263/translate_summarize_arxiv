    "one of the defining properties of globular clusters ( gcs ) is that they show star - to - star differences in the abundances of the light elements , as manifested by c ",
    "na , and ( in some cases ) mg  al anticorrelations ( @xcite ; the recent review by @xcite ) .",
    "with relatively few exceptions ( notably @xmath20  cen , e.g. , @xcite ; and m@xmath1422 , @xcite ) , the [ fe / h ] values of member stars do not vary by more than a few hundredths of a dex , if that ( though some variations with evolutionary state , primarily in the vicinity of the turnoff ( to ) , are expected to be the consequence of atomic diffusion  see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in at least a few systems , there are strong indications that the helium and/or the total c@xmath21n@xmath21o abundances vary significantly ; see the studies of ngc@xmath142808 by @xcite and of ngc@xmath141851 by @xcite .",
    "more commonly deduced are helium mass - fraction abundance variations amounting to @xmath22 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , it is known that clusters of the same [ fe / h ] can have quite different abundances of the so - called  @xmath3-elements \" ( o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and ti ) . whereas most of the milky way gcs with [ fe / h ] @xmath23 appear to have [ @xmath3/fe ] @xmath24 ( @xcite ) , a value near 0.0 has been derived for a few of them , including , e.g. , palomar 12 ( @xcite ) , which seems to be connected to the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( @xcite ) .    to interpret photometric data for the ancient stellar populations found in gcs",
    " or those residing in , e.g. , nearby dwarf galaxies or the galactic bulge , which are characterized by different relations between [ @xmath3/fe ] and [ fe / h ] , as well as other chemical peculiarities ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )  it is obviously important to use stellar models for the _ observed _ abundances .",
    "it has long been known , for instance , that the locations on the h - r diagram of the main - sequence ( ms ) and red - giant branch ( rgb ) segments of isochrones for a fixed age ( @xmath25 gyr ) and low metallicities depend on @xmath13 , but not their subgiant branches ( sgbs ) , which are predicted to be nearly coincident except for a small change in slope ( @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", the cno elements mainly affect the luminosity of the to and the sgb , with little or no impact on the lower ms or the rgb ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , as reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter v12 ) , the temperatures of red giants appear to be controlled chiefly by mg , si , and fe , which are the most abundant metals that are also important electron donors . among the ground - breaking papers that have examined the effects on stellar models of varying the @xmath3-element abundances",
    "are those by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , whereas the implications for observed color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of light - element anticorrelations have been studied by @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xcite ) .",
    "the main purpose of this investigation is to present updated victoria - regina evolutionary tracks and isochrones that allow for variations in [ @xmath3/fe ] , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath13 .",
    "the next paper in this series will provide isochrones in which [ o / fe ] is also treated as a free parameter , whereas subsequent studies will assess the implications of @xmath26 dex variations in [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] over a wide range in [ fe / h ] .",
    "once these projects have been completed , it will be possible , using the interpolation codes provided in this study ( see the appendix ) , to generate evolutionary tracks and isochrones for metals mixtures that have arbitrary amounts ( within reason ) of o , ne , mg , and si at [ fe / h ] values of interest , assuming ( at least initially ) [ @xmath27/fe ] @xmath8 and @xmath2 for the other @xmath3-elements .",
    "there are two main differences between our computations and the model grids reported by other groups ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "first , as described in ",
    "[ sec : abund ] ( following a brief overview of the victoria stellar structure code in   [ sec : input ] ) , our tracks have been calculated for specific values of [ fe / h ] , instead of @xmath28 ( the total mass - fraction abundance of the metals ) , in order to facilitate direct comparisons between theory and observations .",
    "( at constant @xmath28 , the [ @xmath27/h ] value of _ each _ metal changes when the @xmath29 abundance of any one of the heavy elements is modified in the assumed metals mixture . for this reason , the sensitivity of stellar models to the abundances of individual metals , or groups of metals , should be inferred from computations at constant [ fe / h ] , as in the study by v12 , rather than those generated for fixed values of @xmath28 ; see , e.g. , @xcite . )",
    "second , the accompanying software , which is briefly described in the appendix , interpolates simultaneously in all three of the chemical abundance parameters so that isochrones may be generated for arbitrary values of [ @xmath3/fe ] , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath13 ( within the ranges encompassed by the models ) , as well as age . as a result of this flexibility , the consequences of differences in the assumed helium and/or @xmath3-element abundances for observed cmds , the derived mass - radius diagrams of binary stars , etc .",
    ", may be readily evaluated .",
    "indeed , one may also examine the implications of different relations between @xmath13 and/or [ @xmath3/fe ] with [ fe / h ] . in ",
    "[ sec : vrmod ] , plots of selected isochrones on the h - r diagram are presented and discussed , while a few examples of the application of our isochrones to observational data are provided in   [ sec : obs ] .",
    "brief concluding remarks are given in ",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "the evolutionary code described in considerable detail by v12 has been used to compute all of the stellar models reported in this paper . in all respects , up - to - date physics and , in particular , a careful treatment of the gravitational settling of helium has been incorporated into it , together with sufficient extra mixing below envelope convection zones ( when they are present ) to satisfy , in particular , the solar li abundance constraint .",
    "the settling of the metals has not been considered , but the neglect of this physics is largely inconsequential , since a change in the central cno abundances at the several percent level , arising solely from diffusive processes , will have little effect on to luminosity versus age relations .",
    "( because the effective temperature of the turnoff will be altered to some extent by the diffusion of the metals , this physics will affect the _ absolute magnitude _ of the to by a small amount through the bolometric corrections . )",
    "this assertion is supported by the fact that the abundances of the cno elements must be increased by about a factor of two ( i.e. , @xmath3020 times the enhancement caused by settling ) in the nuclear - burning region of a star in order to reduce the predicted age at a given turnoff luminosity by 1 gyr ( see v12 ) .",
    "most of the @xmath31% reduction in age that is generally attributed to the inclusion of atomic diffusion is therefore due to the settling of helium over the star s core h - burning lifetime ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    to be sure",
    ", models that take the diffusion of the metals into account predict that the transition from lower - mass stars that possess radiative cores at central h exhaustion to those of higher mass that have convective cores at the end of the ms phase occurs at a lower mass and luminosity than when this physics is not treated ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the relevant masses ( @xmath32 , depending on the metallicity ) evolve to the rgb tip in less than @xmath33 gyr , whereas the focus of the present study is on stars with longer lifetimes .",
    "moreover , both settling and radiative accelerations should be treated in order to provide the best possible predictions of the chemical abundances at the surfaces of stars as a function of their evolutionary state ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ) .",
    "on the other hand , most spectroscopic studies have failed to detect any differences in the surface metallicities of gc stars between the to and the lower rgb ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite )  unless a hot effective temperature ( @xmath34 ) scale is assumed ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; but even then , the observed [ @xmath27/h ] variations ( @xmath35 dex ) are considerably less than expected .",
    "improved consistency with the model predictions can be obtained if an _",
    "ad hoc _ additional mixing process , perhaps due to turbulence , is assumed to occur at the bottom of surface convection zones when they are present ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but current formulations of this extra mixing ( also see v12 ) involve free parameters that must be calibrated using observations ( e.g. , li abundance data ) .",
    "insofar as the calculation of isochrones is concerned , the neglect of metals diffusion is not a serious omission because this physics mainly affects the predicted temperatures of stars ( in a relatively minor way ; see v12 , their fig .  1 ) , which are subject to many other uncertainties ( see   [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "in particular , the surface boundary conditions play a major role in determining the model @xmath34  scale .      to model the lowest masses ( each grid has a minimum mass of @xmath10 ) , marcs model atmospheres ( @xcite ) at an optical depth @xmath36 were attached to the interior structures following the procedures described by @xcite . in the case of 0.3@xmath37 models ( or somewhat higher masses in the metal - rich or super - metal - rich regimes ) , the stellar photosphere was taken to be the outer boundary and the pressure at @xmath38 was determined by integrating the hydrostatic equation from very small optical depths to the photospheric value , assuming the semi - empirical ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hm74 ) @xmath39@xmath40 structure ( specifically , the fit to the latter given by @xcite ) .",
    "[ when using the sun to calibrate such quantities as the convective mixing - length parameter , it is obviously important to assume the _ solar _ atmospheric structure instead of , say , a grey atmosphere ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "encouragingly , the temperature stratification predicted by recent 3d model atmospheres for solar parameters appears to satisfy observational constraints even better than the hm74 model , which is preferable to current 1d model atmospheres in representing the surface layers of the sun ; see the discussion by @xcite . ]    the ramifications of different treatments of the atmospheric layers for low - mass , [ fe / h ] @xmath8 stellar models are shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "( for an instructive example of similar work carried more than 15 years ago , see @xcite . ) using the properties of marcs model atmospheres at @xmath36 to derive the outer boundary conditions ( bcs ) of stellar models clearly results in increasingly cooler temperatures and reduced luminosities with decreasing mass than attaching the same atmospheres to the interior structures at @xmath38 or deriving the boundary pressure using the scaled hm74 @xmath39@xmath40 relationship ( compare the locations of the open circles along the solid , dashed , and dot - dashed curves , respectively ) .",
    "for these computations ( and , indeed , for all of the lower - ms models in which the marcs atmospheres were attached at depth ) , the advanced equation - of - state ( eos ) developed by a.  irwin was used in its most efficient ",
    "eos4 \" mode .",
    "because irwin s eos , even in the eos4 mode , is slower by a factor of 34 than the eos which is normally employed by the victoria code ( see @xcite ) , we have opted to use the latter for higher mass models ( where the tracks are essentially independent of this choice , see v12 ) .",
    "since the lowest mass models are based a different eos and surface bcs than those for higher masses , it is necessary to make a smooth transition between the two regimes . to accomplish this , evolutionary tracks for masses in the range 0.3@xmath41",
    "were computed ( for each combination of the chemical abundance parameters ) to just past the zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) location on the h - r diagram , assuming the eos and atmospheric bcs employed in the lower - main - sequence ( lms ) grids , on the one hand , and those used in the higher mass tracks , on the other .",
    "the mass for which the differences in @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the respective zams models were the smallest was taken to be the transition mass , and the mean luminosity and temperature differences , which were usually @xmath44 in both @xmath42 and @xmath43 , were calculated .",
    "these offsets were applied to a complete track for the transition mass ( assuming the physics that has been employed for higher masses ) , which became the adopted track for that mass .",
    "no adjustments of any kind were made to the evolutionary sequences for lower or higher masses .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] for a subset of the model grids , the resultant h - r diagrams ( upper panels ) and mass - luminosity relations ( lower panels ) are very smooth in the lms region where this join has been made ( and elsewhere ) . only in magnified versions of this and",
    "similar plots are some _ very slight _ irregularities evident ; e.g. , the spacing between the fourth and fifth loci close to the @xmath37 zams models in the upper panel for @xmath45 is a bit larger than those between the third and fourth or fifth and sixth loci .",
    "however , they have no obvious impact on the predicted mass - luminosity relations .",
    "note that some kind of a transition is unavoidable because proper model atmospheres , attached at depth , must be used as boundary conditions for very low mass models in order to obtain the most realistic @xmath34 scale , whereas scaled hm74 atmospheric structures are the preferred choice for the sun and solar - type stars ( as discussed below ) .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] also plots the lower - ms portion of a 4 gyr isochrone for solar abundances ( the dotted curve ) that was kindly provided to us by g.  feiden ( 2011 , private communication ) .",
    "the bcs for these models ( see @xcite ) were derived from phoenix model atmospheres ( @xcite ) : the latter were attached to the interior structures at @xmath36 if @xmath46 , or at the photosphere , in the case of higher masses .",
    "remarkably , the lowest mass models overlay those represented by the solid curve nearly perfectly , while at @xmath47 , they are cooler than our atmosphere - interior models by @xmath48  k. this is really quite good agreement between completely independent predictions of the properties of very low mass stars .    at lower metallicities ,",
    "the differences between the present victoria - regina and published dartmouth models ( @xcite ) are even less , as shown in the left - hand plot in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] . although they employ different model atmospheres as boundary conditions , the latter are apparently sufficiently similar to marcs atmospheres that they yield nearly the same @xmath34  scale .",
    "moreover , it is apparent from the near coincidence of the filled and open circles that the predicted mass - luminosity relations ( especially at masses @xmath49 ) are in excellent agreement as well .",
    "however , perhaps the most compelling demonstration of the reliability of our computations for lms stars is provided in the right - hand plot , which illustrates how well our models reproduce the mass - radius relation that describes the lowest mass ( 0.213 and @xmath50 ) components of the triple system , koi-126 ( @xcite ) . a similar ( equally successful ) comparison , but using dartmouth models ,",
    "was reported by feiden et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who note that some low - mass binaries ( notably cm draconis ) continue to be problematic , possibly due to the neglect of magnetic fields and activity effects ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "regardless , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] and additional plots presented later in this paper ( see   [ sec : obs ] ) provide encouraging support for the quality of our ms and lms models . [",
    "although discrepancies between predicted and observed cmds are generally found at the faintest absolute magnitudes ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , they are likely due mostly to deficiencies in current color@xmath34  relations , given the great difficulty of accounting for all of the sources of blanketing in model atmospheres and synthetic spectra for cool stars . ]",
    "one question that warrants some discussion is the following : why has the scaled solar hm74 @xmath39@xmath40 relation been used to determine the boundary pressures for the majority of our computed models instead of marcs model atmospheres ?",
    "as already mentioned , the former is the preferred choice for the calculation of a standard solar model , and presumably for models which are relevant to stars with properties similar to that of the sun .",
    "in fact , @xcite showed that surface bcs derived in this way agree rather well with those obtained from scaled , differentially corrected ( sdc ) marcs models over wide ranges in @xmath34 , gravity , and metallicity .",
    "( note that the latter were constructed in order that the resultant solar model atmosphere reproduces the temperature structure derived by hm74 . ) while it is not necessarily the case that the sdc atmospheres provide a better representation of those applicable to , e.g. , metal - deficient stars than standard marcs models , the implied @xmath34  scale agrees quite well with that derived by @xcite ( via the infra - red flux method ) for field subdwarfs that have @xmath17 [ fe / h ] @xmath51 ( see ( * ? ? ? * and   [ subsec : sbd ] later in this paper ) ) .    as regards the @xcite examination of the use of marcs model atmospheres as bcs for interior structures , it is pertinent to note that an identical treatment of convection and the same chemical abundances were assumed in the victoria and marcs codes .",
    "indeed , plots were included in the paper by vandenberg et al .  to illustrate the close agreement of , among other things , the predicted variations with depth ( in the atmosphere ) of the pressure , the adiabatic temperature gradient , the opacity , and the convective flux .",
    "it is not possible to obtain similar consistency with the large grids of model atmospheres published by @xcite because , for one thing , they assumed a value of 1.5 for the mixing - length parameter @xmath52 , whereas the evolutionary models presented in this paper required @xmath53 to satisfy the solar constraint .",
    "there are also minor differences in the adopted heavy - element abundances , which could have some effect on the opacities at low temperature .",
    "in addition , the marcs atmospheres were computed for a fixed helium abundance ( @xmath29(he)@xmath54 , on the scale @xmath29(h)@xmath55 , or @xmath56 ) . in stellar models that take gravitational settling into account",
    ", the surface value of @xmath13 can fall to quite small values when the envelope convection zones become very thin ( see v12 ) .",
    "such variations will affect the mean molecular weight in the atmospheric layers and presumably have some repercussions for the temperature structure .    even though suitable model atmospheres for use as bcs in the computation of _ diffusive _ stellar models are not currently available , we did some limited explorations of the effects on the predicted @xmath34  scale of using the current marcs grids in this way .",
    "the results of those experiments are shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] , which plots evolutionary tracks for the indicated masses and chemical abundances , on the assumption of different treatments of the atmosphere . the dotted track for [ fe / h ] @xmath57 differs only slightly from one that passes through @xmath58 ( @xmath59  k ) and @xmath60 ( the solar temperature and bolometric luminosity ) at the solar age ( 4.57 gyr ) insofar as it assumed @xmath61 whereas a standard solar model requires @xmath62 .",
    "the solid and dashed loci for the same metallicity assume @xmath53 , as in the case of the dotted curve ( and indeed , all other evolutionary sequences that have been computed ) , but instead of employing bcs based on the hm74 @xmath39@xmath40 relation , interpolations in the tabulated properties of the marcs model atmospheres at @xmath38 or at @xmath36 , respectively , were carried out to fit the atmospheres to the interior structures .",
    "in contrast with the findings of @xcite , who found fairly small differences between the tracks ( for similar masses and chemical compositions ) when marcs atmospheres were fitted to _ non - diffusive _ stellar models at the photosphere or at depth , the solid and dashed tracks are appreciably offset from each other .",
    "because they run roughly parallel to one another , it seems more likely that differences in the low-@xmath39 opacities or of the assumed value of @xmath52 is responsible for this separation since , at the zero - age ms location , diffusion has not had enough time to significantly alter the surface abundances .",
    "regardless , one could apply suitable adjustments to the pressures predicted by the marcs atmospheres , either at the photosphere or at @xmath36 , to force consistency of these cases with the solar constraint .",
    "doing so results in the long - dashed and dot - dashed curves , which are not very different from the dotted track .",
    "the solar calibration thus compensates for most of the differences in the assumed physics .",
    "however , the computations for [ fe / h ] = @xmath63 show that there are systematic variations in the tracks as a function of metallicity .",
    "when marcs atmospheres are used as bcs , with or without _ ad hoc _ adjustments to the pressures at the photosphere or at @xmath36 , the resultant tracks are all hotter than the dotted track ( by as much as 200 k , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) . whether or not this is telling us that the isochrones presented in this study for low [ fe / h ] values are too cool is hard to say ( though it is tempting to conclude that this is probably the case ) . on the one hand ,",
    "the use of the same @xmath39@xmath40 structure for all stellar models , regardless of mass , metallicity , and evolutionary state , can hardly be realistic .",
    "on the other hand , our isochrones appear to be able to reproduce the properties of local subdwarfs with _ hipparcos _",
    "parallaxes quite well ( see   [ subsec : sbd ] , and vandenberg et al .",
    "it is always possible , for instance , that errors associated with the surface bcs are compensating for those arising from the treatment of convection or from other physics ingredients .",
    "the observed @xmath34  scale is simply not yet precise enough to provide good constraints on the temperatures predicted by stellar models .",
    "the final point worth making here is that , as shown by v12 , the victoria and recent mesa ( @xcite ) evolutionary codes produce nearly identical tracks when very close to the same physics is assumed .",
    "indeed , predictions of such quantities as the age , luminosity , and helium core mass at the rgb tip are also in excellent agreement .",
    "the same can be said of the tracks produced by the dartmouth code ( @xcite ) , as those computations also appear to be nearly indistinguishable from ours when the same mass and chemical abundances , and very similar input physics , are adopted ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .",
    "3 ) ) . judging from e.g. , the plots provided by @xcite , such good consistency between the results of the various evolutionary codes currently in use is not always obtained , though the extent to which differences in the physics are responsible for this is not clear .",
    "efforts should be made to understand the origin of any such discrepancies that are found .",
    "although v12 computed numerous grids of models for wide ranges in [ fe / h ] that allowed for variations in @xmath13 and [ @xmath3/fe ] , as well as for different heavy - element mixtures in which the abundances of @xmath64 metals were varied in turn , the decision was made to recompute most of them .",
    "doing so enables us to adopt the updated solar abundances by @xcite instead of the preliminary determinations given by @xcite ( which were assumed by v12 ) , and to consider ( in subsequent papers in this series ) @xmath26 dex variations in the abundances of those metals which have especially important consequences for observed cmds ( notably o , ne , mg , and si ) .    in their exploratory study , v12 investigated the effects of 0.4 dex enhancements in the abundances of individual metals .",
    "such variations are too large : in the case of the most abundant @xmath3  elements , star - to - star variations about some representative [ @xmath3/fe ] value ( e.g. , 0.4 dex , if [ fe / h ] @xmath18 ) are typically @xmath650.2 dex ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , it is of some interest to determine how both overabundances and underabundances of the various metals affect computed tracks and isochrones as a function of [ fe / h ] given that such effects are unlikely to have a strictly linear dependence .",
    "( because of the overwhelming importance of oxygen for turnoff luminosity versus age relations and the likelihood that the most metal - deficient stars have [ o / fe ] @xmath66 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the next paper will provide low - metallicity models in which [ o / fe ] varies from 0.2 to 1.0 , in 0.2 dex increments , on the assumption of [ @xmath27/fe ] @xmath67 for the other @xmath3  elements .",
    "sets of models for [ @xmath3/fe ] @xmath8 , but with [ o / fe ] @xmath68 dex , will also be provided . )",
    "the models provided in this paper thus represent the  base grids \" that will be intercompared with those to be presented in subsequent studies that allow for variations in the abundances of individual metals . here ,",
    "the same [ @xmath27/fe ] values ( @xmath9 , 0.0 , and @xmath2 ) have been adopted , in turn , for each of the @xmath3 elements ( o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and ti ) assuming the @xmath29 abundances for the solar mixture given by @xcite . these determinations are listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] , together with the abundances of the other 11 metals that are considered when opal opacities ( @xcite ) are requested for stellar interior conditions using the livermore laboratory web site .",
    "( as in v12 , opal opacities for each of the assumed chemical mixtures have been employed , along with the complementary low-@xmath39 opacities that have been generated specifically for this project using the code described by @xcite . ) once the abundances of the @xmath3  elements had been set ( to be consistent with the desired value of [ @xmath3/fe ] ) , the abundances of all 19 metals were scaled to the [ fe / h ] values of interest simply by adding the latter to the resultant @xmath29 values .",
    "thus , for the case in which [ @xmath3/fe ] @xmath4 and [ fe / h ] @xmath69 , the @xmath29 abundances of , e.g. , c , o , and fe are 7.43 , 8.09 , and 6.50 , respectively .",
    "this ensures that , for this particular example , [ c / fe ] @xmath8 and [ o / fe ] @xmath4 for the assumed [ fe / h ] value , and hence that [ c / h ] @xmath70 [ fe / h ] @xmath69 while [ o / h ] @xmath71 .    since theoreticians express metal abundances in terms of mass - fractions , @xmath72 ( for the @xmath73 element ) , and the total metallicity by the quantity @xmath28  as opposed to the use of @xmath27/h number - abundance ratios by observers  it is necessary to transform between the different ways of specifying chemical abundances in order to ensure that stellar models are computed for the _ observed _ abundances .",
    "fortunately , both groups of astronomers are comfortable using @xmath13 to describe the helium abundance , but this does cause a slight complication when converting from number- to mass - fraction abundances ( or to [ @xmath27/h ] values ) .",
    "assuming @xmath74 for hydrogen and , say , 10.9 ( as a first approximation ) for helium , the number - fraction abundances for the @xmath75 element are given by @xmath76 , where the summation includes all of the elements that are considered . if @xmath77 is used to represent the atomic weight of element @xmath78 , then the corresponding mass - fraction abundances are given by @xmath79 , and @xmath80 . by iterating on the value of @xmath29(he ) using , e.g. , the secant method ,",
    "these calculations can be repeated until @xmath81 is equal to the desired value of @xmath13 .    from the resultant determinations of @xmath29 , the values of [ @xmath27/h ]",
    "can be computed using the adopted solar abundances ( the second column in table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) .",
    "note that , if stable isotopes of a given element are not treated separately , as in the calculation of the number - fraction abundances that must be specified when generating opal opacities , the appropriate number - weighted value of @xmath77 should be used .",
    "for instance ,",
    "@xmath82(c)@xmath83 if @xmath84(@xmath85c)@xmath86(@xmath87c)@xmath88 and the atomic weights of @xmath85c and @xmath87c are 12.00000 and 13.00336 ( @xcite ) , respectively . by following these procedures , it is obviously quite easy to obtain essentially exact equivalences between the different ways of specifying the abundances of the chemical elements in stars and in stellar models . in particular ,",
    "very precise values of @xmath72 and @xmath28 can be determined that correspond to arbitrary values of [ fe / h ] ( or , more generally , [ @xmath27/h ] ) .",
    "put another way : starting with the tabulated @xmath29 and desired [ fe / h ] values , the procedures described above will yield the correct mass - fraction abundances that should be assumed in the models which are used to interpret data for the observed metallicities .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig5 ] provides a pictorial summary of the values of [ @xmath3/fe ] and [ fe / h ] for which grids of evolutionary tracks have been computed . at each of the 42 points which are represented by open circles ,",
    "model sequences have been generated for @xmath0 , 0.29 , and 0.33 , and for masses that vary from @xmath10 to a sufficiently high value ( ranging between 1.1 and @xmath89 , depending on the metallicity ) that its rgb tip age is @xmath905 gyr .",
    "this ensures that isochrones with complete giant branches can be computed for older ages ( @xmath91 gyr ) .",
    "in general , the tracks were terminated at the onset of the helium flash , once the he - burning luminosity due to the triple-@xmath3 process exceeded @xmath92 , or when the age of the model reached 30 gyr , whichever occurred first .",
    "the methods described by v12 , with the recent updates to them that are reported in the appendix of the present paper , were used to determine the so - called  equivalent evolutionary phase \" ( eep ) points along the tracks .",
    "it is these eep files that are interpolated to produce isochrones for arbitrary values of age , [ @xmath3/fe ] , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath13 ( within the ranges encompassed by the model grids ; see the appendix ) .",

    ", the importance of advancing our understanding of model atmospheres , which provide the interface between stellar interior models and observed stars and stellar populations , can hardly be understated .      in their extensive survey of gc ages",

    "acs ( advanced camera for surveys ) photometry obtained by @xcite when the cluster distances were determined from fits of zero - age horizontal - branch ( zahb ) loci to the observed hb stars .",
    "all of the models used in that investigation assumed the solar metal abundances given by @xcite , with suitable enhancements to the abundances of @xmath3-elements and then scaled to the [ fe / h ] values derived by @xcite . as we have not yet computed zahbs for the chemical mixtures assumed in this study , we are unable to follow exactly the same procedure here in order to ascertain , in particular ,",
    "how the inferred distance moduli will differ from those found by vandenberg et al .",
    "however , the predicted zahb luminosities , at the same [ fe / h ] , are likely to be quite similar because the main difference in the solar mixtures given by grevesse & sauval and @xcite are the abundances of cno , which mainly affect the color of the hb .. since the majority of low - metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath18 ) stars in the milky way appear to have [ o / fe ] @xmath189 ( see , e.g. , ramrez et al .",
    "2012 ) , it is our intention to provide the means to interpolate in the resultant grids to obtain zahb sequences ( and isochrones ) for different oxygen abundances at the same values of [ fe / h ] and @xmath13 ( assuming [ @xmath27/fe ] @xmath8 and @xmath2 for the other @xmath3-elements ) .",
    "a further advantage of presenting all of the zahb models in the same paper is that our discussion of them will be considerably simplified . ]    because to luminosity versus age relations depend sensitively on the absolute abundance of oxygen ( see v12 ) , and because our models assume a smaller value of [ o / fe ] ( by 0.1 dex ) as well as a lower solar abundance of oxygen , it can be expected that we will obtain higher ages for metal - poor clusters than those derived by @xcite ( if all other variables are kept constant ) .",
    "however , this is a moot point for the present discussion .",
    "our main motivation for examining the cmds of a few gcs is to check how well our models are able to reproduce the observed ms and rgb morphologies . to partially compensate for the expected effects of the different abundances of oxygen noted above ( and of other metals ) , we have _ arbitrarily _ assumed slightly larger distance moduli ( by @xmath190 mag ) and ages ( by 0.25 gyr ) than the values derived by vandenberg et al . , and then matched the predicted and observed turnoffs . to accomplish this , it was necessary to apply a small blueward shift to the isochrones ( by @xmath191 mag ) after the observed colors had been dereddened .",
    "scale were adjusted to lower values by 0.20.3 dex to be consistent with the findings of recent spectroscopic studies of m15 ( @xcite , @xcite ) and m92 ( @xcite ) , and by 0.10.15 dex at metallicities appropriate to more metal - rich clusters , such as m5 . however",
    ", this is just one of many possible explanations of differences between predicted and observed turnoff colors ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their   6.1.2 ) ) . ]",
    "the result of this exercise is shown in figure  [ fig : fig14 ] for the gcs 47 tuc , m@xmath143 , m@xmath145 , and m@xmath1492 .",
    "as in the vandenberg et al study , the [ fe / h ] values derived by @xcite have been assumed .    except at @xmath192 ,",
    "where the solid curves deviate to the blue side of the observed lower - ms stars , the isochrones do quite a good job of matching the main sequences of the gcs over the entire range in [ fe / h ] sampled by them .",
    "the biggest differences between theory and observations occur along the lower rgb , where the models are too red .",
    "however , the tendency of photometric scatter due to blending to be preferentially blueward on the giant branch may explain some fraction of such offsets ( see @xcite ) .",
    "curiously , the discrepancies resemble the effect on the location of the rgb of varying the helium content : as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] , increasing @xmath13 causes a larger temperature shift at the base of the giant branch than near the tip . on the other hand , it is possible that our treatment of the atmospheric boundary condition is responsible for the apparent difficulties ( recall fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) , or perhaps they signal some problems with the color@xmath34 relations that we have used or our treatment of convection . as noted in the introductory remarks given at the beginning of ",
    "[ sec : obs ] , predicted temperatures and colors are subject to many uncertainties , and it should not be a surprise to find some discrepancies between isochrones and observed cmds .    to corroborate this point , we have generated isochrones for the case represented in fig .",

    "that is , a full set of evolutionary tracks has been computed for [ fe / h ] @xmath193 , @xmath0 , and [ @xmath3/fe ] @xmath67 in which the surface boundary conditions have been derived from the properties of marcs model atmospheres at @xmath36 , with the small increase in the pressure at that point implied by the corresponding standard solar model .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fig15 ] , the 13 gyr isochrone derived from these tracks , unlike the one plotted in the bottom , right - hand panel of the previous figure , provides a good fit to the lower rgb stars of m@xmath1492 , but not those at higher luminosities .",
    "( granted , the predicted turnoff is slightly too blue , but an improved fit to the to could be obtained , without affecting the location of the lower rgb , simply by assuming a somewhat higher oxygen abundance . ) in this example , the discrepancies along the upper giant branch could be telling us that , e.g. , our treatment of convection or the adopted color@xmath34  relations are inadequate .",
    "we could force the models to provide an essentially perfect match to the data ( by , for instance , suitable adjustments of the color transformations or the atmospheric boundary conditions ) , but the assumed distance and chemical abundances of m@xmath1492 may not be correct . although isochrones may need to be  calibrated \" for some investigations , not doing so enables one to retain the predictive power of stellar models .",
    "in fact , it is remarkable that current stellar models perform as well as they ( appear to ) do .",
    "to obtain the correct understanding of stars and stellar populations , it is important to determine the observed chemical abundances and , in the case of complex systems ( e.g. , @xmath194cen ) , their variations from star - to - star with as much accuracy and detail as possible through spectroscopic and photometric studies .",
    "it is just as important to interpret such data using stellar models for the observed chemistries because the most abundant metals ( and helium ) affect the predicted luminosities and temperatures of stars in different ways ( see , e.g. , v12 ) . for this investigation ,",

    "one point worth additional emphasis is that our models ( and the marcs color@xmath34 relations ) favor a relatively hot temperature scale for metal - poor stars .",
    "this is not a new result , as virtually the same thing was found by @xcite .",
