    "the nucleus is a two component , charged system with a finite diffuse layer .",
    "this fact specifies a number of various peculiarities of the nuclear surface and symmetry energies : dependency on the density profile function , non - zero contribution to the surface symmetry energy , connection to the nuclear incompressibility , etc .",
    "the additional refinements appear due to the quantum effects arising from the smallness of nucleus .",
    "in particular , the curved interface creates the curvature correction to the surface energy @xmath5 and the surface part of symmetry energy @xmath6 of order @xmath7 and can play the appreciable role in small nuclei as well as in neck region of fissionable nuclei .",
    "the presence of the finite diffuse layer in nuclei creates the problem of the correct definition of the radius and the surface of tension for a small drop with a diffuse interface .",
    "two different radii have to be introduced in this case @xcite : the equimolar radius @xmath0 , which gives the actual size of the corresponding sharp - surface droplet , and the radius of tension @xmath1 , which derives , in particular , the capillary pressure .",
    "bellow we will address this problem to the case of two - component nuclear drop . in general , the presence of the curved interface affects both the bulk and the surface properties .",
    "the curvature correction is usually negligible in heavy nuclei .",
    "however , this correction can be important in some nuclear processes . for example the yield of fragments at the nuclear multifragmentation or the probability of clasterization of nuclei from the freeze - out volume in heavy ion collisions @xcite . in both above mentioned processes , small nuclei necessarily occur and the exponential dependence of the yield on the surface tension @xcite should cause a sensitivity of both processes to the curvature correction",
    ". moreover the dependency of the curvature interface effects on the isotopic asymmetry of small fragments can significantly enhance ( or suppress ) the yields of neutron rich isotopes .    in the present paper ,",
    "we analyze of the interface effects in an asymmetric nuclear fermi - liquid drop with a finite diffuse layer .",
    "we follow the ideology of the extended thomas - fermi approximation ( etfa ) with effective skyrme - like forces combining the etfa and the direct variational method with respect to the nucleon densities , see ref .",
    "the proton and neutron densities @xmath8 and @xmath9 are generated by the diffuse - layer profile functions which are eliminated by the requirement that the energy of the nucleus should be stationary with respect to variations of these profiles . in order to formulate proper definition for the drop radius , we use the concept of the dividing surface , originally introduced by gibbs @xcite . following the gibbs method , which is applied to the case of two component system , we introduce the superficial ( surface ) density as the difference ( per unit area of dividing surface ) between actual number of particles @xmath10 and the number of bulk , @xmath11 , and neutron excess , @xmath12 , particles which a drop would contain if the particle densities were uniform .",
