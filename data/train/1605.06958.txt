    "originally , random walks have been introduced by plya @xcite in 1921 . since then , many studies have dealt with this topic , as they are an ubiquitous model for physical , biological and social processes @xcite .",
    "example applications from biology include self - propelled motion of bacteria , and the diffusion of nutrients @xcite , as well as animal motion in general @xcite .",
    "another example is the marking of territories by animals or the description of home ranges @xcite . for the latter case a strong increase of the amount of experimentally available data ocurred after the introduction of automated radio / gps tagging of animals @xcite .",
    "the usage of minimum convex polygons , called _ convex hulls _ , bordering the trace of an animal @xcite is a simple yet versatile @xcite way to describe the home range and can be used for any type of ( random - walk ) data . in two dimensions ,",
    "the convex hull of a point set is the minimum subset whose elements form a convex polygon in such a way that ( a ) all points of the set and ( b ) the connecting lines between all possible pairs lie inside the polygon .    much progress has been made on the analytical side , when the number of steps is very large and the random walk ( with a finite variance of the step size ) converges to the continuous - time brownian motion ( for a review see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the mean perimeter @xcite and mean area @xcite of a single two - dimensional brownian motion are known for a long time .",
    "it was shown @xcite recently that the problem of computing the mean perimeter and the mean area of the convex hull of an arbitrary two - dimensional stochastic process can be mapped to computing the extremal statistics of the one - dimensional component of the process .",
    "this procedure was successfully applied recently to compute the mean perimeter and the mean area of several two - dimensional stochastic processes such as the random acceleration process in 2d  @xcite , 2d branching brownian motions with absorption and applications to edpidemic outbreak  @xcite and 2d anomalous diffusion processes  @xcite . very recently , this method was also successfully used to compute the exact mean perimeter of the convex hull of a planar brownian motion confined to a half - space  @xcite . finally , using different methods , the mean perimeter and the mean area of the convex hull of a single brownian motion , but in arbitrary dimensions ,",
    "have been computed recently in the mathematics literature  @xcite .",
    "analytical calculations of even the second moment for the area and perimeter of a convex hull regarding single two - dimensional brownian motion turned out to be very difficult @xcite . for",
    "the full distributions of the area and perimeter no analytical results are known so far , so the usage of computer simulations is a natural approach , as done in a recent study @xcite .    here",
    ", we are interested in multiple random walkers , which perform their walks independently from each other . the investigation of @xmath0 non - interacting random walkers on a @xmath13-dimensional regular lattice has been done in @xcite .",
    "many studies have been published for interacting multiparticle walkers @xcite , e.g. , in one dimension @xcite .",
    "the mean first passage time of @xmath0 independent diffusing particles in euclidean space is calculated , e.g. , in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "recently , the mean perimeter and the mean area of @xmath0 independent brownian motions have been computed in 2d  @xcite . in this article",
    "we want to check the predictions from theory by numerical simulations of @xmath0 non - interacting time - discrete brownian random walkers as well as the probability density functions of the area and perimeter of the corresponding convex hulls .",
    "in particular we apply a numerical large - deviation approach to obtain the probability density functions over a large range of the support , down to probability densities as small as @xmath6 . in addition , we are interested in what way the same results for @xmath14 walkers are found in comparison to the @xmath9 case @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ rw_ch_a ] introduces the random walk model , the convex hull of a two - dimensional point set , and briefly elucidates an algorithm to obtain such a convex hull . part [ ld_sch ]",
    "explains the large - deviation scheme used to obtain the probability density function over a large range of the support including the low - probability tails .",
    "the next part [ res ] presents the results achieved from our simulations .",
    "the last section [ concl ] concludes the article and a short outlook is given .",
    "a time - discretized random walk consists of @xmath1 step vectors @xmath15 , and the position @xmath16 at time step @xmath17 is the sum of all steps up to @xmath18 , i.e. : @xmath19 the walk configuration itself is then the set @xmath20 of steps @xcite . the step @xmath21 itself denotes a displacement of the particle by @xmath22 in @xmath2-direction and @xmath23 in @xmath3-direction . here",
    ", we consider a time - discrete approximation to a brownian walk , i.e. , both @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , for each @xmath24 , drawn randomly from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance one .",
    "all considered walks are open , i.e. , the walker does not need to get back to the starting point @xmath25 after @xmath1 steps .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , where only single walks with one walker have been investigated , we put multiple random walks under scrutiny .",
    "so , starting from the origin of the coordinate system , @xmath0 independent random walkers perform their walks simultaneously .",
    "the resulting point set @xmath26 of @xmath27 points given by the individual positions of all @xmath0 walkers after each time step is then further investigated .",
    "the convex hull @xmath28 of a two - dimensional point set @xmath29 is described through a convex set over @xmath30 .",
    "the points @xmath31 within @xmath32 are given by all possible combinations @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( definition given according to @xcite ) .",
    "this means :    1 .",
    "all points @xmath37 lie within @xmath32 .",
    "2 .   all lines @xmath38 also lie within @xmath32 .",
    "the boundary of the convex set is a polygon which connects a subset @xmath39 of @xmath40 points from the point set , i.e. , @xmath41 , with @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the hull is attributed with area @xmath4 and perimeter @xmath5 according to ( identifying @xmath44 with @xmath45 ) : @xmath46    for our work , we determined the polygons bordering convex hulls ( for which one uses shortly the term `` convex hull '' ) numerically . for convenience ,",
    "we use dimensionless quantities subsequently , as all convex hulls are represented in a computer .    here",
    ", we used the `` jarvis march '' algorithm @xcite , which has a complexity of @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the number of points in the investigated point set and @xmath40 the number of points in the convex hull . in this algorithm , the convex hull",
    "is calculated in a `` gift - wrapping '' manner , where one needs to make sure that all points of the set lie on e.g. , the right side of a starting point .",
    "the next point added to the convex hull is the point which has the minimum angle between the line connecting both points and the vertical .",
    "this procedure is repeated until one reaches the starting point again .    in usual cases ,",
    "the application of convex hull algorithms can be accelerated by usage of pre - selection heuristics , such as the one introduced by akl and toussaint @xcite .",
    "this heuristic looks up extreme points of the set ( i.e. , those of maximum and minimum @xmath2- and @xmath3-coordinates ) and discards all points which lie inside the quadrilateral formed by these points .",
    "we use a custom refinement of this heuristic , which is based on iterating the heuristic under rotation of the coordinate origin , which eliminates another fraction of inert points per each iteration .",
    "for simple - sampling results , walk configurations @xmath49 for multiple walkers @xmath0 are generated randomly , and the according convex hulls @xmath32 are calculated through the algorithm , resulting in a multitude of values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "obtaining histograms of these values only gives access to the high probability regime , where the convex - hull properties of typical random walks are measured .",
    "however , in order to obtain values of these quantities with especially low probabilities , allowing us to measure the distributions @xmath50 and @xmath51 over a large range of the support , a certain markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) scheme can be used @xcite .",
    "the mcmc consists of an evolution of random walks @xmath52 and corresponding sets @xmath53 of points .",
    "@xmath54 is another discrete `` time '' parameter , not to be confused with the time parameter @xmath18 of the random walks . for the walks",
    ", we measure the property @xmath55 , i.e. , the area ( @xmath56 ) or perimeter ( @xmath57 ) of the convex hull of the point sets , depending on which distribution @xmath50 or @xmath51 we are aiming at .",
    "the initial configuration @xmath58 is any walk configuration , e.g. , a randomly chosen one .    at each monte carlo step @xmath54 , all @xmath0",
    "independent walks @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) are altered to @xmath61 by replacing one randomly selected step @xmath15 ( @xmath62 ) in each walk with a newly generated step @xmath63 .",
    "the new step is generated according to the same distribution as all other random walk steps , i.e. , the @xmath2- and @xmath3-coordinate of @xmath63 are drawn independently from a gaussian distribution .",
    "note that by exchanging e.g. , the first step @xmath64 , all following positions @xmath65 ( cf . , eq .  ) of the walk are changed .",
    "the convex hull of the point set @xmath66 resulting from the @xmath0 walks @xmath61 is calculated , leading to the quantity @xmath67 .",
    "the alteration @xmath68 is _ accepted _ ( @xmath69 ) according to the metropolis probability :    @xmath70\\,.\\ ] ]    here , @xmath71 is the ( artificial ) monte carlo `` temperature '' , which is a parameter used to set the range of the sampled values .",
    "if the alteration is not accepted , it is _ rejected _ ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath72 .    like in any mcmc simulation one needs to equilibrate the simulation , i.e. , discards the initial part of the measured quantities until `` typical '' values are found .",
    "typical equilibration times are @xmath73 sweeps ( one sweep equals @xmath1 mc steps ) for e.g. , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 for the area of the convex hull . in addition , we pick only each @xmath77th data point from the original measurement to get roughly decorrelated values . for the case above we use @xmath78 sweeps , which is a typical value . towards low absolute values of the temperature this value needs to be increased , so e.g. , for @xmath79 in the above case , we choose @xmath80 sweeps .    for a given quantity ( @xmath56 or @xmath57 ) and a given walk length @xmath1 one gets different probability density functions ( pdfs ) @xmath81 for each temperature @xmath71 used .",
    "they are related to the actual distribution @xmath82 according to the relation @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a normalization constant . for different values of @xmath71 , different ranges of the measured value @xmath85",
    "are obtained .",
    "this allows for a piecewise reconstruction of @xmath82 via suitable choices of the normalization constants @xmath84 .",
    "they can be calculated through inversion of this formula whenever for two values @xmath86 and @xmath87 the ranges of the sampled values of @xmath85 overlap .",
    "thus , the temperatures are chosen such that for neighbouring @xmath71 the measured histograms sufficiently overlap .    for a more detailed description of the calculation of the normalization constants @xmath84 and the determination of the pdf from the pdfs for the single temperatures we refer to , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "note that the large - deviation approach has already been applied successfully for the case of the convex hull of the point set of one ( @xmath9 ) walker @xcite . in that reference also",
    "the test case of independent points was simulated and a comparison with analytical results yielded a good agreement .",
    "for @xmath75 random walks we performed simulations for walk lengths of @xmath88 $ ] while measuring and biasing for the area @xmath4 and the perimeter @xmath5 of the convex hulls , respectively . to obtain a large range of the support for the pdfs of these two quantities we used e.g.  17 temperatures @xmath89 $ ] ( excluding the value @xmath90 , which corresponds to simple sampling ) for @xmath74 for the pdf of @xmath4 and about 40 temperatures @xmath91 $ ] for @xmath5 .",

    "[ pdf_l50_xwalks_area_res ] and [ pdf_l50_xwalks_peri_res ] show the distributions with a corresponding rescaling of the axis .",
    "apparently the quality of the collapse is not very good but seems to get gradually better when making the number @xmath0 of walks very large .",
    "this can be seen when looking at the insets of the figures , where the change of the distributions for @xmath193 @xmath194 @xmath97 is rather small , compared to the change @xmath92 @xmath194 @xmath195 .",
    "this corresponds to the just discussed behavior of the mean , where also strong scaling corrections at small number @xmath0 of walks are visible .",

    "[ pdf_l50_xwalks_peri_res],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    finally , we consider the shape of the distributions in the limit of a large number of walkers and long walk lengths .",
    "the distribution of the perimeter , on which we focus here , can be approximated @xcite by the distribution of @xmath197 times the _ span _ of @xmath0 independent one - dimensional random walkers .",
    "since the span is given by the sum of the two extreme points in positive and negative directions of the @xmath0 one - dimensional walkers , this distribution is basically given by the convolution of two gumbel extreme - value distributions .",

    "correspondingly to eq .",

    "the dashed line shows the result of a fit to the distribution given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bessel : fit ] ) , wich resulted in @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 , yielding @xmath209 .",
    "the inset shows the reduced chi - square for two different numbers of walkers as a function of the walk length .",

    "[ rate_fct_peri_xwalks ] we show the data of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bessel : fit ] ) with the parameters as obtained from the fit for @xmath204 and @xmath205 plotted in the same way as the rate function , also in double - logarithmic scale .",
    "apparently , the shape of the rate functions shown in the main plot become more and more similar to the function shown in the inset .",
    "the actual values are quite different , because the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are very different for the two cases .",
    "this is due to strong corrections to the leading scaling behavior , as visible in fig .",
    "[ rate_fct_3walks_area ] , where also the minimum moves left and down when increasing the walk length  @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , the result supports qualitatively the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bessel : fit ] ) . for a more quantitative statement",
    "the numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 which can be studied using the large - deviation approach are too small due to the huge numerical effort which would needed in this case .    anyway , our results indicate that for @xmath211 and @xmath212 the distribution of the perimeter of many walkers can indeed be described by a suitably rescaled convolution of two gumbel extreme - value distributions .    for the case of the area ( not shown ) we observe a similar behavior as for the perimeter .",
    "again we found that close to the minimum a change of the shape starts to appear .",

    "we have performed simulations of multiple two - dimensional discrete - time random walks with gaussian displacements .",
    "convex hulls of the random walks have been calculated and the area @xmath4 and perimeter @xmath5 have been obtained .",
    "we have applied a large - deviation scheme , via biasing markov - chain monte carlo evolutions in the configuration space of walks .",
    "the bias was introduced with respect to large or small areas or perimeters , respectively . in this way we have been able to obtain these distributions , for moderate number of walks , over large ranges of the support .",
    "thus , we could measure probability densities spanning as many as 1000 decades in probability .",
    "the resulting probability densities show the same scaling behavior as the mean with respect to the length @xmath1 of the walks , i.e. , @xmath213 and @xmath214 appear to be universal densities .    for small numbers @xmath0 of walkers , the shape of these universal densities follows gaussian distributions for @xmath5 and @xmath10 , respectively , as for the @xmath9 case .",
    "also , for the deviations of the distribution in the direction of very small diameters and areas , the previously found ( @xmath9 ) essential singularity is obtained for low-@xmath0 multiple random walks .",
    "we also obtained the rate functions for area and perimeter , rescaled with the scaling behavior of the maxima , i.e. , @xmath215 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "for both quantities , the finite - length rate functions approach limiting functions for @xmath184 , showing that the densities follow the large - deviation principle @xcite .",
    "this makes it likely that using analytical approaches from large - deviation theory , some results for the distributions of the convex hulls may be obtained .",
    "anyway , the rate functions seem to be well described by a power law in the case @xmath216 , as found previously in the @xmath9 case .",
    "finally , we have verified , that the scaling behavior of the averages with respect to the number @xmath0 of walks is predicted as in the literature @xcite . the convergence is slow , such that on the level of the full distribution the convergence to a limiting function is not fully visible .",
    "nevertheless , using simple - sampling simulations of number of walks up to @xmath97 , a convergence in the high - probability , i.e. , peak region is visible , making a full convergence likely .",
    "furthermore , these results are compatible with a convergence of the distribution of the perimeter to a convolution of two gumbel extreme - value distributions .",
    "for future research it would be interesting to investigate multiple interacting walkers  @xcite , or multiple walkers performing self - avoiding walks or loop - erased random walks  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in higher dimensions a change of the scaling of the obtained distributions and thus also of the shape of the distributions can be anticipated , making such studies useful .",
    "finally , it would be very interesting to apply the methods used here to biological models to investigate the formation of animal territories  @xcite , which had originally motivated this work .",
