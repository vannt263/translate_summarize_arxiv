    "in this paper we analyze the number of irreducible substructures of @xmath0-noncrossing , @xmath3-canonical rna structures .",
    "we prove that the numbers of irreducible substructures of @xmath0-noncrossing , @xmath3-canonical rna structures are , in the limit of long sequence length , given via the density function of a @xmath4-distribution .",
    "an rna structure is the helical configuration of its primary sequence , i.e.  the sequence of nucleotides * a * , * g * , * u * and * c * , together with watson - crick ( * a - u * , * g - c * ) and ( * u - g * ) base pairs .",
    "as rna structure is oftentimes tantamount to its function , it is of key importance .",
    "the concept of irreducibility in rna structures is of central importance since the computation of the minimum free energy ( mfe ) configuration of a given rna molecule is determined by its largest , irreducible substructure .",
    "three decades ago , waterman @xcite pioneered the combinatorics of rna secondary structures , an rna structure class exhibiting only noncrossing bonds .",
    "secondary structures can readily be identified with motzkin - paths satisfying some minimum height and plateau - length , see figure  [ f : sec ] .",
    "the latter restrictions arise from biophysical constraints due to mfe and the limited flexibility of chemical bonds .",
    "it is clear from the particular bijection , that irreducible substructures in rna secondary structures are closely related to the number of nontrivial returns , i.e.  the number of non - endpoints , for which the motzkin - path meets the @xmath6-axis .    for dyck - paths",
    "this question has been studied by shapiro @xcite , who showed that the expected number of nontrivial returns of dyck - paths of length @xmath7 equals @xmath8 .",
    "subsequently , shapiro and cameron @xcite derived expectation and variance of the number of nontrivial returns for generalized dyck - paths from @xmath9 to @xmath10 @xmath11=\\frac{2n-2}{tn+2}\\quad \\mbox { and } \\quad \\mathbb{v}[\\xi_t]=\\frac{2tn(n-1)((t+1)n+1)}{(tn+2)^2(tn+3)}.\\ ] ] the bijection between dyck - path of length @xmath7 and the unique triangulation of the @xmath12-gon , due to stanley @xcite , implies a combinatorial proof for @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "an alternative approach is to employ the riordan matrix @xcite , an infinite , lower triangular matrix @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 with @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 .",
    "clearly , @xmath19 is the generating function of dyck - paths and let @xmath20 denote the number of dyck - paths of length @xmath7 with @xmath21 nontrivial returns .",
    "we consider the riordan matrix @xmath22 and extract the coefficients @xmath20 from its generating function @xmath23 by lagrange inversion .",
    "setting @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we obtain @xmath27(f(z)+1)^{j+1 } = \\frac{j+1}{2n - j-1}{2n - j-1 \\choose n},\\ ] ] where @xmath28 . from this",

    "( [ e : formel ] ) , for @xmath31 follows .    in section  [ s : gap ]",
    "we consider the bivariate generating function directly , which relates to the riordan matrix in case of generalized dyck - path as follows @xmath32 our main idea is to derive the bivariate generating function from the riordan matrix employing irreducible paths and to establish via singularity analysis a discrete limit law .",
    "this is done , however , for the far more general class of @xmath33-tableaux introduced in section  [ s : back ] : in theorem  [ t : central ] we show that the limit distribution of nontrivial returns for these vacillating tableaux is given in terms of the density function of a @xmath34-distribution , which is , already for motzkin - paths , a new result . for restricted motzkin - paths satisfying specific height and plateau - lengths , the riordan matrix ansatz does not work `` directly '' , since the inductive decomposition of restricted motzkin - paths is incompatible .",
    "instead we introduce the notion of irreducible paths and express the riordan matrix in terms of the latter , see lemma  [ l : bistar ] .",
    "this ansatz allows us to compute the generating function of irreducible paths via setting one indeterminate of the bivariate generating function to one .",
    "the framework developed in section  [ s : gap ] and section  [ s : empty ] , in fact works as long as the generating function of the particular path - class has a singular expansion and is explicitly known .",
    "we have , for instance , for nontrivial returns of motzkin - paths with height @xmath35 and plateau length @xmath35 : @xmath36\\approx 0.8625 $ ] and @xmath37\\approx 1.2343 $ ] .",
    "indeed , rna structures are far more complex than secondary structures : they exhibit additional , cross - serial nucleotide interactions @xcite .",
    "these interactions were observed in natural rna structures , as well as via comparative sequence analysis @xcite .",
    "they are called pseudoknots , see figure  [ f : reid3.eps ] , and widely occur in functional rna , like for instance , ep rna @xcite as well as ribosomal rna @xcite .",
    "rna pseudoknots are conserved also in the catalytic core of group i introns . in plant",
    "viral rnas pseudoknots mimic trna structure and in vitro rna evolution @xcite experiments have produced families of rna structures with pseudoknot motifs , when binding hiv-1 reverse transcriptase .",
    "combinatorially , cross serial interactions are tantamount to crossing bonds . to this end",
    ", rna pseudoknot structures have been modeled via @xmath0-noncrossing diagrams @xcite , i.e.  labeled graphs over the vertex set @xmath1=\\{1,\\dots , n\\}$ ] with degree @xmath38 .",
    "diagrams are represented by drawing their vertices @xmath39 in a horizontal line and its arcs @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , in the upper half plane . here",
    "the degree of @xmath42 refers to the number of non - horizontal arcs incident to @xmath42 , i.e.  the backbone of the primary sequence is not accounted for .",
    "the vertices and arcs correspond to nucleotides and watson - crick ( * a - u * , * g - c * ) and ( * u - g * ) base pairs , respectively , see figure  [ f : reid3.eps ] .",

    "let @xmath50 be a sequence of isolated points , and @xmath51 be an arc .",
    "we call @xmath50 interior if and only if there exists some arc @xmath51 such that @xmath52 holds and exterior , otherwise . any exterior sequence of consecutive , isolated vertices is called a gap . a diagram or subdiagram",
    "is called irreducible , if it can not be decomposed into a sequence of gaps and subdiagrams , see figure  [ f : gapsub ] .",
    "accordingly , any @xmath0-noncrossing diagram can be uniquely decomposed into an alternating sequence of gaps and irreducible subdiagrams . in fact",
    "irreducibility is quite common for natural rna pseudoknot structures , see figure  [ f : pseudo1 ] .",
    "we call a @xmath0-noncrossing , @xmath3-canonical diagram with arc - length @xmath53 and stack - length @xmath54 , a @xmath0-noncrossing , @xmath3-canonical rna structure , see figure  [ f : dia ] .",
    "we accordingly adopt the notions of gap , substructure and irreducibility for rna structures .",
    "our main result is theorem  [ t : centra2 ] , which proves that the numbers of irreducible substructures are in the limit of long sequence length given via the density function of a @xmath4-distribution .",
    "furthermore , we show that the probability generating function of the limit distribution is given by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is expressed in terms of the generating function of @xmath0-noncrossing , @xmath3-canonical rna structures @xcite and its dominant singularity @xmath57 . in figure",
