    "in 2004 , kim and chan @xcite discovered a rotational anomaly in torsional oscillator ( to ) measurements on solid @xmath0he and proposed that it was due to supersolidity . in measurements of the shear modulus of solid @xmath0he , day and",
    "beamish @xcite observed a softening of the solid with the same dependence on temperature and @xmath3he concentration as that of the resonant frequency shift in to measurements .",
    "the softening was attributed to the evaporation of @xmath3he impurities from dislocations as the temperature @xmath4 increased above 100 to 200  mk .",
    "it was a surprise to realize that , in its `` supersolid '' state where part of the mass is supposed to flow through the rest of the solid , this solid was actually stiffer than when no flow is observed.@xcite however , this apparent contradiction was tentatively explained by assuming that mass superflow occurs in the core of dislocations only if the latter are not free to move.@xcite according to this scenario , the rotational anomaly ( i.e. the supersolidity ) and the elastic anomaly ( the change in stiffness ) could be two consequences of a single phenomenon , namely the binding / unbinding of @xmath5he impurities to dislocations .    at the same time",
    ", one realized that , as @xmath4 was lowered , both an inertia decrease due to the appearance of supersolidity and a stiffening due to dislocation pinning should induce an increase of the to resonance frequency.@xcite moreover , j.d .",
    "reppy observed a large frequency shift that was not consistent with supersolidity and more likely due to a stiffness change.@xcite when a to is made of several parts that are not rigidly bound together , as is the case in reppy s experiment , the to frequency shift may reach several percent of the `` mass loading '' - the shift due to filling the to with solid @xmath6he .",
    "we understand this as a `` glue effect '' , which means that solid @xmath6he glues parts together so that any change in the stiffness of solid @xmath6he has a large effect on the to frequency . on the other hand , very rigid tos with a simpler geometry should not exhibit this glue effect and the magnitude of the elastic effect has been much smaller .",
    "this is the case with the to used by west et al.@xcite where the frequency shift was about 0.015% and the calculated contribution from the stiffness change 60 times smaller .    as a consequence one should check in every experiment whether a rotational anomaly in a to measurement originates from a change in the inertia or in the elastic coefficient ( ref . ) .",
    "for this reason we have built a simple and rigid to with a sapphire `` minibottle '' that could be filled either with a single crystal or with a polycrystal ( fig .",
    "[ schematic ] ) .",
    "if one assumes that superflow in a supersolid takes place inside defects , the magnitude of the superfluid fraction should increase with disorder and it should be _ smaller _ in single crystals than in polycrystals",
    ". this would be consistent with measurements by clark et al.@xcite as for elastic properties , rojas _",
    "et al_.@xcite showed that single crystals have a _",
    "larger _ stiffness anomaly than polycrystals.@xcite the softening observed in the crystals is consistent with a 50 to 86% decrease in the elastic coefficient @xmath7 whereas that in the polycrystals is due to a 7 to 15% decrease in the effective shear modulus @xmath8 .",
    "based on these numbers , one would expect a larger frequency shift for a single crystal than for a polycrystal if the rotation anomaly is controlled by elasticity.@xcite our comparison of single crystals to polycrystals in a sapphire to could thus discriminate between the two possible origins of rotational anomalies . as we shall see below , we observed a larger effect with single crystals , a result that is not consistent with the supersolid scenario .",
    "we first verified that growth at constant volume from the normal liquid using the `` blocked capillary method '' produces polycrystals whose grain boundaries could be seen during melting , while growth from the superfluid on the melting line produces single crystals without grain boundaries and with easily visible facets.@xcite as we shall see below , we found that in our to the rotation anomaly for a polycrystal is below the resolution of our measurement , if it exists . on the opposite , we found definite frequency shifts for single crystals .",
    "the magnitudes of these frequency shifts were reproducible when measured with the same crystal , but they varied from one single crystal to another , as expected from recent calculations , if the crystal orientation with respect to the rotation axis changed.@xcite",
    "our transparent sapphire minibottle sits atop a coin silver torsion rod ( fig .",
    "[ schematic ] ) .",
    "the sample volume in our cell has a cylindrical geometry with a hemispherical part at the top to which the fill line was glued with stycast 1266 .",
    "this cell shape has no sharp corners .",
    "it was chosen to obtain a rigid cell that could be filled by solid helium without leaving liquid regions behind during crystallization when the liquid - solid interface goes up from the bottom .",
    "it also minimized the risk of facet blocking as the single crystals reached the neck at the top of the minibottle .",
    "the cylindrical section had an inner diameter of 11.1 mm and a height of 15.2 mm .",
    "the growth of polycrystals at constant volume started at 2.55 k and finished at 1.97 k , implying that the final pressure in the solid was 38 bar .",
    "this to resonates near 910  hz . the `` mass loading '' was 1.8  hz . all measurements shown here were done with the fill line of the 1k stage closed in order to minimize mechanical vibrations .",
    "we have grown many crystals in this cell . for clarity we present the last three ones for which the best stability and reproducibility was obtained after optimization of our methods .",
    "the sample labeled `` single crystal # 1 '' was first grown at 10  mk with a growth speed @xmath910 @xmath8 m/s . before any further treatment , the to results in this crystal were not reproducible as a function of time .",
    "random jumps of order 1  mhz always occurred during the temperature scan ( 12 hours ) .",
    "these jumps made it impossible to achieve the stable resolution we needed ( 0.1 mhz ) .",
    "apparently , when a high quality crystal is in equilibrium with liquid @xmath6he at the orifice of the fill line , some mass spontaneously rearranges somewhere , which makes the to frequency unstable .",
    "we had to escape from the liquid - solid equilibrium to obtain stable measurements .",
    "this was achieved by warming the crystal to 1.4 k , melting 10% of the crystal and then regrowing it with a growth speed @xmath93 @xmath8 m/s . at 1.4  k",
    ", no facet could block the growth near the orifice of the fill line.@xcite furthermore , if a small amount of liquid still remained in the cell at 1.4 k , it would have solidified very soon after cooling started.@xcite since cooling below 1.4  k along the melting line changes the cell pressure , some anisotropic stresses may have produced some dislocations in this single crystal until all the liquid space including the fill line had solidified .",
    "single crystal # 2 was obtained in the same way but grown from a different seed .",
    "this crystal was warmed up to 1.45 k , at which point 20% of the crystal was melted and regrown . in single crystals grown at 1.4  k , syshchenko and beamish @xcite measured a dislocation density in the range 10@xmath3 to 10@xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "we estimate that this dislocation density is approximately equal to or possibly greater than the density in our single crystals .",
    "we primarily operated the to at constant response amplitude and constant drive frequency , extracting the resonant frequency , @xmath12 , and quality factor , @xmath13 , from the phase of the to response and the drive level with a method similar to that of ref . .",
    "this method is different from the more widely used phase locked loop where the response amplitude and the drive frequency are not kept constant while scanning the temperature .",

    "a function generator is used to apply an ac voltage , @xmath19 , on the order of millivolts to the drive electrode .",

    "the susceptibility @xmath30 characterizes  the response , @xmath31 , of a to to an externally applied torque , @xmath32 .",
    "our to is well described by the form@xmath33where the coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 may be temperature dependent .",
    "we have defined @xmath36 so that a positive static torque decreases @xmath31 .",
    "the resonant frequency @xmath37 and @xmath13 of the to are related to the root of @xmath38 ( ref . ) .",
    "we obtain@xmath39and@xmath40 one way we determined @xmath37 and @xmath13 of the to was by measuring the response of the to at constant temperature and drive level while sweeping the drive frequency through the resonance ( a frequency sweep ) .",

    "the drive level was set so that the desired to rim speed was approximately obtained at the starting temperature of the temperature sweep .  at this point",

    "the values of @xmath37 and @xmath45 at the desired rim speed were then obtained by averaging for 10 minutes .",
    "the temperature was then incremented or decremented , and the measurement routine was repeated .",
    "in fig .  [ raw ] we present example measurements of the resonant frequency shift @xmath67 of the to @xmath68 temperature @xmath4 for the three different samples . this shift is the difference between the actual to frequency and a reference frequency .",
    "this reference frequency is adjusted for each sample so that the high temperature parts superimpose .",
    "the specified rim speeds are measured at the inner surface of the cylindrical portion of the minibottle . the frequency shift with the polycrystalline sample is linear in @xmath4 above @xmath980 mk , as found when the cell is filled with superfluid except for a different slope .",
    "near 40  mk , the frequency shows a maximum which is known to be due to the to fabrication materials as found by other groups.@xcite thus , we see no evidence for a rotational anomaly within the resolution of our experiment ( 0.2  mhz ) .",
    "this means that , if it exists , the superfluid fraction is less than 10@xmath69 in this polycrystal .",
    "it is also consistent with a change in @xmath8 of less than 15%,@xcite a reasonable value.@xcite this result is robust : for example , we show in fig .",
    "[ raw ] that the @xmath4 dependence of the frequency shift is the same for rim speeds of 3 and 10 @xmath8m / sec for both warming and cooling .",

    "we compute the frequency shift relative to the polycrystal rather than a superfluid filled cell because the latter has a linear @xmath4 dependence above 300 mk that is different from the solid ones , as found by other groups.@xcite the slope is 9 mhz / k when the cell and its fill line are filled with superfluid , compared with 8 mhz / k for the solid samples .",
    "thus , computing @xmath70 best exposes the relevant behavior .",
    "as the temperature was decreased , an increase in @xmath70 was observed with a magnitude of 1  mhz ( 2 mhz ) for single crystal # 1 ( # 2 ) .",

    "our observation of larger frequency shifts in single crystals than in polycrystals does not seem consistent with supersolidity since the density of dislocations along which the supersolid may flow is presumably at least as large in polycrystals as in single crystals .",
    "thus softening of the crystals seems like the most likely explanation for our observations.@xcite one usually assumes that edge dislocations easily glide only parallel to the basal planes of the hcp structure @xcite and therefore that @xmath7 is the only elastic coefficient that softens in helium crystals .",
    "however , the magnitude of the frequency shift we observe in single crystal # 2 is too large to be explained by variation of @xmath7 alone . according to ref .",
    ", the 86% reduction in @xmath7 ( relative to its intrinsic , low @xmath4 value ) observed in ref . can produce a frequency shift as large as 0.03% of the mass loading .",
    "single crystal # 2 had a three times larger shift of 2  mhz ( 0.1% of the mass loading ) .",
    "if dislocations can glide parallel to non - basal high density planes , other elastic coefficients could soften , for example @xmath76 .",
    "calculations of the to frequency shift as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath81 are shown in fig .",
    "[ assf].@xcite if the @xmath77-axis of the crystal is parallel to the axis of rotation of our to and @xmath7 is close to zero , @xmath81 would need to soften by approximately 50% to produce a frequency shift of 0.1% of mass loading , as with single crystal # 2 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the frequency shift reaches very large values as @xmath7 and @xmath81 approach zero , for this orientation .",
    "there are some interesting differences between the present results and previous observations .",
    "_ @xcite observed a frequency shift that was three to five times larger when samples were grown at constant volume ( forming polycrystals ) than at constant @xmath4 and @xmath82 from the superfluid ( presumably forming single crystals ) .",
    "this is the opposite of the dependence on crystal quality that we observe , even though the topology the cells in the two experiments is the same and the rigidity of the cells is similar .",
    "this difference could be due to the different shapes of the two cells ( the interior of our cell has no sharp angles so as to minimize any liquid regions after growth at constant temperature ) or the fabrication material ( our cell is the only one to be constructed with polished sapphire , producing very smooth walls ) .",
    "we also observe the softening in single crystals at a higher temperature than in other experiments , except perhaps that of penzev _",
    "et al_.  @xcite we checked that this difference can not be attributed to a difference in @xmath3he content .",
    "a possible explanation is that the geometry of our cell and our growth process produces crystals with very low dislocation density . as the dislocation density decreases , the average pinning length in the absence of impurities , i.e. the network length @xmath83 , increases .",
    "this in turn causes an increase in the pinning temperature @xmath84 ( supplement to ref . ) , where @xmath85 is the @xmath5he impurity binding energy , @xmath86 is the atomic spacing along the dislocation , and @xmath87 is the bulk concentration of @xmath5he impurities .",
    "thus the onset of the frequency shift should occur at a higher temperature .",
    "our results therefore suggest that our geometry , cell materials and crystal growth procedure produce very high quality crystals",
    ". it would thus be interesting to directly measure the dislocation density in the crystal .",
    "our results also suggest that elastic coefficients other than @xmath7 may change . in view of this",
    ", it would also be interesting to measure the temperature dependence of all elastic coefficients of @xmath0he oriented single crystals , not only the average shear modulus of polycrystals  day2007 or some combination of coefficients in single crystals .",
