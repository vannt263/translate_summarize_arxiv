    "the past decade has seen the discovery of a large number of massive young star clusters throughout the local universe .",
    "these systems are large and young enough that they contain statistically significant numbers of massive stars , affording us key insights into their initial mass function and structural properties .",
    "of greatest interest to dynamicists are those systems in which stellar dynamical time scales are short enough that the cluster can undergo significant structural change during the lifetimes of the most massive stars . in such clusters ,",
    "dynamical evolution opens up entirely new avenues for stellar and binary evolution , allowing the formation of stellar species completely inaccessible by standard stellar and binary evolutionary pathways .    from this perspective",
    ", the clusters listed by portegies zwart and mcmillan ( these proceedings ) represent an ideal combination of properties , having ages of less than a few million years and relaxation times of less than a few tens of millions of years . in these clusters , dynamical evolution ,",
    "traditionally regarded as a `` slow '' process , actually occurs much more rapidly than the stellar evolution of even the most massive stars .",
    "thus the dynamics controls the early phases of these stars lives .",
    "we focus here on perhaps the most dramatic environmental modification of standard stellar evolution  repeated physical collisions between stars .",
    "the scenario described below is fast becoming the `` standard '' paradigm by which runaway stellar mergers might occur , perhaps forming intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) in sufficiently dense systems .",
    "the possibility of multiple mergers of massive stars in dense stellar systems was first demonstrated in n - body simulations of r136 by portegies zwart et al .",
    "subsequently ebisuzaki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that the ultraluminous x - ray source m82-x1 might be the result of such a process ; this possibility was explored in detail by portegies zwart et al .",
    "portegies zwart & mcmillan ( 2002 ) and mcmillan & portegies zwart ( 2003 ) have explored the possibility of imbh formation in young clusters in the galactic center .",
    "recently , grkan et al .  (",
    "2004 ) have reaffirmed the basic process using monte - carlo simulations , and have carried out systematic studies of runaway mergers in galactic nuclei .    in this paper",
    "we consider how a young star cluster might come to be in such a high - density state , and look critically at the key physical processes needed for a runaway merger to occur .",
    "we then turn briefly to the possibility of an imbh in the center of the milky way galaxy ( maillard et al .",
    "2004 ) , showing how theory and recent observations may provide a consistent picture of the galactic center .",
    "consider a massive object of mass @xmath0 and radius @xmath1 moving through a field of background stars of total mass density @xmath2 and velocity dispersion @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are large compared to the masses and radii of other stars , and all velocities are small enough that gravitational focusing dominates the total cross section , the object s collision cross section is @xmath6 , nearly independent of the properties of the other stars .",
    "the rate of increase of the object s mass due to collisions then is @xmath7 if the object initially has @xmath8 and we adopt a simple mass  radius relation @xmath9 , then for the object to reach @xmath10 in 3 myr ( to form an imbh within the lifetime of a massive star ) , the local density must satisfy @xmath11 such a density is much higher than the mean density of any known star cluster , young or old . for comparison ,",
    "the average density of the arches cluster is @xmath12 , that of a fairly compact globular cluster is @xmath13 , while even the most concentrated globular cluster cores have @xmath14 .",
    "mergers would be enhanced if the cluster were born very centrally concentrated , as suggested by portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and merritt et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . as a simple limiting model of such a cluster ,",
    "consider the nearly isothermal system of total mass @xmath15 and half - mass radius @xmath16 , described by the density profile @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "densities exceeding @xmath19 are found for @xmath20 , where @xmath21 where the cluster velocity dispersion is @xmath22 .",
    "however , the total mass contained within this radius is just @xmath23 we conclude that , for reasonable cluster parameters , there is too little initial mass in the high - density region to accomplish the task of forming a @xmath24 object in the time available .",
    "thus collisions in a static cluster core can not lead to the formation of an ultramassive object . however , cluster dynamical evolution can result in conditions much more favorable for a runaway merger to occur .",
    "the evolution of a cluster is governed by its half - mass relaxation time , the time scale on which two - body encounters transport energy around the system : @xmath25 ( heggie & hut 2003 ) . here , @xmath26 is the number of stars in the system , @xmath27 is the mean stellar mass , taken here to be @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the mean cluster density , and @xmath30 . for an equal - mass system , the time scale for dynamical evolution  the core collapse time  is about @xmath31 , too long to cause significant structural change within a few million years .",
    "however , the presence of even a modest range in masses greatly accelerates the process of core collapse ( spitzer 1987 ) .",
    "the time scale for a star of mass @xmath32 to sink to the cluster center as equipartition reduces its velocity is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the local relaxation time .",
    "portegies zwart & mcmillan ( 2002 ) find that the most massive ( @xmath35 ) stars segregate rapidly to the cluster center , forming a dense stellar subcore on a time scale @xmath36 .",
    "a central density increase of 23 orders of magnitude is typical , boosting even a relatively low - density core into the range where collisions become common , and greatly increasing the supply of raw material to form a collision runaway . in systems with @xmath37 myr ( @xmath38 myr ) , essentially all the massive stars in the cluster reach the center before exploding as supernovae , and hence can participate in the runaway process .",
    "the arches and westerlund i fall into this category ; the quintuplet , ngc 3603 , and r136 all come close . in these cases ,",
    "the maximum mass of the runaway is limited primarily by the total number of massive stars in the system  anywhere from a few percent to several tens of percent of the total , depending on the cluster mass function .    in less dense or more massive clusters",
    ", the longer half - mass relaxation time means that only a fraction of the massive stars initially present in the system can reach the center in the time available , but the total supply of mass may still ensure that a runaway can occur .",
    "we can estimate the amount of mass made available by mass segregation as follows . again adopting an isothermal model to simplify the calculation , and taking the segregation time scale from eq .",
    "[ tseg ] , it is easily shown that a star of mass @xmath32 can sink to the center within time @xmath39 if its initial distance @xmath40 from the cluster center satisfies @xmath41 the fraction of stars of mass @xmath32",
    "satisfying this relation is @xmath42 choosing ( again for simplicity ) a mass function @xmath43 for @xmath44 , we determine the total stellar mass potentially available for mergers as @xmath45 where the lower mass limit @xmath46 is somewhat greater than the mean stellar mass ( @xmath47 here ) , but is otherwise unimportant so long as it is much less than the upper limit of @xmath48 .",
    "the result for the chosen mass function is @xmath49 comfortably above the value needed for imbh formation .",
    "we have assumed here that the cluster relaxation time is long enough that @xmath50 for all @xmath32 of interest .",
    "this is the case for @xmath51 myr .",
    "an appropriately modified version of this analysis for @xmath52 myr shows the available mass leveling off at a fixed fraction of the cluster mass as @xmath53 , as expected .",
    "given that dynamical evolution can concentrate enough mass in a cluster core for collisions to occur at a significant rate , we can then ask ( i ) if the collisions actually lead to mergers , and ( ii ) under what circumstances a runaway merger can occur . the answer to the first question",
    "is provided by the sph simulations of freitag & benz ( 2001 ; see also lombardi et al .",
    "2003 ) , who find that the low relative velocities typical of these systems ensure that the colliding stars usually merge with minimal mass loss . in small systems ( containing less than a few tens of thousands of solar masses ) ,",
    "collision rates are significantly enhanced by the fact that the massive object tends to form binaries , which are then perturbed into eccentric orbits by encounters with other stars ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ) .",
    "binary - induced mergers increase the collision cross section , but they still require high central densities before the ( three - body ) binary formation rates become significant . in larger systems ,",
    "unbound collisions appear to be the norm .",
    "thus collisions naturally involve the most massive stars in the cluster , and lead to the production of even more massive objects .",
    "the merger products are generally out of thermal equilibrium and often rapidly rotating , with the result that their subsequent stellar evolution is currently poorly understood . in our simulations",
    "we generally assume that the merged object evolves along a suitably rejuvenated ( non - rotating ) track appropriate to its mass ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "this is at best a crude approximation , but we note that it probably underestimates the radius of the merger product during the out - of - equilibrium phase and hence the likelihood of a runaway .",
    "acting in the opposite sense is the fact that , while stellar mass loss rates are very uncertain , ultramassive stars probably have very strong winds .",
    "van beveren ( these proceedings ) points out that if the wind mass loss rate exceeds the accretion rate due to mergers , then the entire runaway process may fail .",
    "our simulations generally yield net merger accretion rates of @xmath54 , suggesting that a high ( but perhaps not impossibly so ) mass - loss rate is needed to shut the process down .",
    "of course , it must be conceded that next to nothing is known about the detailed evolution and ultimate fate of stars hundreds or thousands of times more massive than the sun . nevertheless",
    ", the estimates presented here make it clear that dynamical evolution in dense stellar systems can easily produce conditions suitable for repeated stellar collisions .",
    "the collision runaway at the center of such a system should be extremely luminous and eminently observable during its short lifetime .",
    "observations of the cores of dense young star clusters in our galaxy and beyond may thus shed light on the structure and lifetimes of such ultramassive stellar objects .",
    "if our evolving cluster happens to reside close to the galactic center , then dynamical friction will tend to drive it inward , raising the possibility that mass segregation can lead to a collision runaway en route , and that the resulting imbh can be transported rapidly toward the center by the much more massive cluster ( mcmillan & portegies zwart 2003 ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates this possibility .",
    "it shows the mass @xmath4 and galactocentric distance @xmath5 of the runaway formed in a cluster of initial mass @xmath55 , placed in a circular orbit of radius 10 pc , as it spirals inward and is disrupted by the galactic field .",
    "we clearly see the inward transport of the growing merger product , terminating with the dissolution of the cluster at @xmath56 myr .",
    "subsequently , the black hole sinks more slowly to the center , eventually reaching @xmath57 at @xmath58 myr .",
    "the early ( @xmath59 myr ) portion of the figure is from an n - body simulation ; the remainder is based on a simple analytical model of the galactic potential ( sanders & lowinger 1972 ) .",
    "the recent report by maillard et al .",
    "( 2004 ) of a possible imbh near the galactic center , at the heart of the swarm of stars known as irs13 , provides the exciting prospect of confronting our models directly with reality .",
    "portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 2005 , in preparation ) find that the observed properties of irs13 are completely consistent with theoretical expectations for a dense cluster remnant .",
    "they further estimate that the total imbh mass resulting from runaway collisions in the cluster population which produced the inner bulge is consistent with the @xmath60 supermassive black hole at the galactic center .",
