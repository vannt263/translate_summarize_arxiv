    "the continuous photodetection model ( cpm ) was proposed in the early 1980 s in order to treat quantum optics situations in which a weak electromagnetic field enclosed in a cavity is continuously measured through the photocounting approach @xcite .",
    "the theory has received considerable attention in the following years due to its new microscopic interpretation of the photodetection process @xcite , relation to the quantum trajectories approach @xcite and several proposals for applications . among them",
    "we find studies of photocounts statistics in diverse systems @xcite , quantum non - demolition measurements @xcite , implementation of measurement schemes @xcite , quantum state preparation a9,a11,a12,a13,a16 , quantum control via photodetection @xcite , and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "cpm is extensively discussed in the literature ueda2,a15,sd1,sd2,omd - job , so we shall mention only its main properties .",
    "the model , also referred as a theory , describes the field state evolution during the photodetection process in a closed cavity and is formulated in terms of two fundamental _ operations _ , assumed to represent the _ only _ events taking place at each infinitesimal time interval .",
    "( 1 ) the one - count operation , represented by the _ quantum jump superoperator _ ( qjs ) , describes the detector s action on the field upon a single count , and the trace calculation over the qjs gives the probability per unit time for occurrence of a detection .",
    "( 2 ) the _ no - count _",
    "operation describes the field non - unitary evolution in absence of counts .    if one sets the formal expressions for these operations , all possible outcomes of a photocounting experiment can be predicted .",
    "for instance , the photocounts @xcite and the waiting time waiting1,waiting2,waiting3,waiting4 statistics are among the most common quantities to be studied both theoretically and experimentally . moreover , cpm conferred a new step in photodetection theories by allowing to determine the field state after an arbitrary sequence of measurements , thus creating the possibility of controlling the field properties in real time experiments @xcite .    actually , the qjs is the main formal ingredient within the theory , since it also dictates the form of the no - count superoperator @xcite .",
    "two different models for the qjs were proposed _",
    "ad hoc_. the first one was proposed by srinivas and davies @xcite , the _ sd - model _ , as @xmath0where @xmath1 is the field density matrix , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the usual bosonic ladder operators and @xmath4 is roughly the detector s ideal counting rate @xcite . from the very",
    "beginning the authors @xcite denounced the presence of some inconsistences when the qjs ( [ 01 ] ) is employed for describing a real photodetection process , this point was also appointed in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this qjs is widely used in the literature ueda2,ueda4,ueda6,a2,a4,a6,a7,a9,a10,a12,a13,a16 .",
    "the other proposal @xcite assumes for the qjs an expression written in terms of the ladder operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( also known as _ exponential phase operators _",
    "p1,p2,vourd92,p3,p4 ) @xmath7 in @xcite we called _ e - model _ such a choice , to differentiate from the sd qjs ( [ 01 ] ) .",
    "besides eliminating the inconsistencies within the sd - model , the use of  the e - model leads to different qualitative and quantitative predictions for several observable quantities . by an analysis of a microscopic model for the detector",
    ", it was recently shown that the qjs s ( [ 01 ] ) and ( [ 02 ] ) are particular cases of a general time - dependent _ transition superoperator _ , each one occurring in a particular regime of the detector experimental parameters @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was pointed out that by manipulating certain detector s accessible parameters one could engineer the form of the qjs , thus changing the dynamics of the photodetection , as well as the field state after a sequence of measurements .    a way to check the validity of the cpm and to decide which qjs better describes",
    "the phenomenon in practice can be accomplished through photocount experiments in a high finesse cavity by comparing the results to the theoretical predictions . however , real detectors and cavities are far from ideal .",
    "so our first goal is to include into the cpm the effects of non - ideality , such as quantum efficiency ( qe ) , dark counts , detector s dead - time and cavity damping . our second goal is to call attention to the fact that standard photodetection measurements could verify which of the qjs models actually prevails experimentally .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec . [",
    "s2 ] , we present a simple model , which enables us to include the effects of non - ideality  qe and dark counts  into the cpm using the quantum trajectories approach . then we calculate the main quantities characterizing the photodetection process  the photocounting and waiting time distributions . in subsection [ suba ]",
    "we do this using the qjs ( [ 01 ] ) , and in subsection [ subb ] we repeat the same procedure for e - model . in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] , we analyze the behavior of the lower moments of the above distributions in realistic situations and point out how one could decide about a qjs from experimental data . sec .",
    "s4 contains conclusions . in the appendix [ apendix1 ]",
    "we treat the effects of dead - time and cavity damping : we show that 1 ) cavity losses are not significant compared to non - unit qe effect , 2 ) the dead - time effect leads to mathematical inconsistences in sd - model , yet it is free of them in e - model , being however quite small compared to qe effect .",
    "appendix apendix2 contains some mathematical details concerning evaluation of quantities of interest for different quantum states .",
    "we consider a free electromagnetic mono - modal field of frequency @xmath8 , enclosed in an ideal cavity together with a photodetector ( in the appendix [ apendix1 ] we show that the cavity damping is not crucial if the detector has non - unit qe ) .",
    "the _ unconditioned time evolution _ ( ute ) of the field in the presence of the detector , i.e. the evolution when the detector is turned on but the outcomes of the measurements are disregarded ( not registered ) , is described by the master equation @xcite @xmath9where @xmath10 is a superoperator and @xmath11 is the number operator .",
    "the first term stands for the free field evolution while the second describes the effect of the detector on the field due to their mutual interaction .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is the field - detector coupling constant , roughly equal to the ideal counting rate @xcite .    to describe photocounting with qe @xmath12 and finite dark counts rate @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the ratio between the dark counts rate and the ideal photon counting rate ) , we assume the following expression for the qjs ( c.f .",
    "the expression resulting from the microscopic model in @xcite ) @xmath15it describes the action of the detector on the field upon a photodetection , and its trace gives the probability per unit time of the click .",
    "actually , the microscopic model @xcite suggests that ( [ qjs ] ) has a diagonal form in the fock basis , but this will not be important here , since we shall be interested only in diagonal elements . the first term within the parenthesis describes the absorption of a photon from the field with probability per unit time @xmath16 = \\eta \\lambda \\bar{n}$ ] , where @xmath17 is the field mean photon number  this means that the detector ` sees ' all the photons .",
    "the second term describes the occurrence of a dark count with field - independent probability density @xmath13 , and this event by itself does not modify the field state ( the field state after a single dark count is @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , when both terms are present , the field state upon a detector s click becomes a mixture of both outcomes .    from the quantum trajectories approach and cpm @xcite ,",
    "all the quantities related to photodetection can be calculated provided the complementary no - count superoperator @xmath19 is known ( @xmath19 describes the action of the detector on the field during the time interval @xmath20 without registered counts ) . acting @xmath19 on the initial field state @xmath21",

    "is slightly modified , yet it is quite different from the behavior in the sd - model , as shown in the figure figure2 .",
    "this is another possible manner for verifying the applicability of sd- or e- models .",
    "we now turn our attention to the waiting time analysis .",
    "it is important to define the time interval in which we do the average : if one has non - zero dark counting rate , then by performing the average over a very large time interval , we shall always get for the mean waiting time the value @xmath119 , which is nothing but the mean time interval between consecutive dark counts .",
    "since experimentally the average is done over finite time intervals , we shall proceed in the same way : the mean waiting time for initial times , when the photon number is significative , is roughly @xmath120 ( because @xmath121 is the effective counting rate ) , so we shall take the average over a time interval @xmath122 .",
    "this means that if one does not detect consecutive counts within the time @xmath123 , such a measurement will not contribute to the average .",

    "this is a drastic difference from the ideal case , in which no counts occur after all the photons having been absorbed , so the mean waiting time saturates at the inverse value of the counting rate , as shown in @xcite . moreover , from figure figure3 one verifies that as long as there are photons in the cavity the mean waiting time is nearly time - independent within the e - model ( and truly independent in the ideal case @xcite ) , and do increase substantially in time for sd - model",

    ", we showed that in standard photodetection experiments one could check the applicability of the qjs of sd- or e- models .",
    "namely , we indicated three different ways for revealing the actual qjs : ( 1 ) quantitatively , one should study the time dependence of the normalized second factorial photocounts moment .",
    "qualitatively , we showed that the models can be also distinguished by measuring : ( 2 ) whether the effective detection time depends on the initial average photon number in the cavity and ( 3 ) whether the mean waiting time is modified as time goes on . to that end",
    "we have considered three different kinds of field in the cavity : the number , coherent and thermal states ; each one on its own permitted to do comparisons between the two studied qjs s .",
    "results with other kinds of fields could also be presented here , as for instance the binomial state or the so - called squeezed state , however , no new physics related to the goals of the paper appears . a last remark , if the experimental data would depart significantly from the theoretical prediction one should reconsider both models and try to look for alternative mechanisms to reproduce the outcomes .    in conclusion , we believe that our theoretical treatment could provide clues for an experimental verification of the cpm , contributing with valuable insights about the quantum nature of the photodetection in cavities , as well as giving rise to the possibility of field state manipulation through detector post - action on the field .",
