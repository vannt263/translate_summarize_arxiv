    "cooperation , predator - prey , and competition are three main interactions among species in eco - systems . among them , competition is one of the most popular interactions .",
    "such interactions occur when two or more species compete for the same resource such as food , shelter , nesting sites , etc . due to competition ,",
    "the growth of a species is depressed in the presence of others .",
    "traditionally , competitive interactions are modeled by systems of ordinary differential equations known as the lotka - volterra models .",
    "for instance , a competitive lotka - volterra model for two species takes the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent the densities of the two species at time @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are intrinsic growth rates , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are intra - specific competition rates while @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the inter - specific competition .",
    "an important question regarding the competitive interaction is whether the species co - exist or a competitive exclusion occurs .",
    "this question has been addressed fully for the deterministic model given by .",
    "we state a result whose proof can be found in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "[ thm1 ] let @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    *",
    "if @xmath12 and @xmath13 , all positive solutions @xmath14 to converge to the unique positive equilibrium @xmath15 . * if @xmath12 and @xmath16 , all positive solutions @xmath14 converge to @xmath17 . *",
    "if @xmath18 and @xmath13 , all positive solutions @xmath14 converge to @xmath19 . *",
    "if @xmath18 and @xmath16 , there is an unstable manifold @xmath20called the separatrix@xmath21 splitting the interior of the positive quadrant @xmath22 into two regions .",
    "solutions above the separatrix converge to @xmath23 , while solutions below the separatrix tend to @xmath19 .",
    "proposition [ thm1 ] indicates that in case ( i ) , the interspecific competition is not too strong , so the two species coexist . for the rest of the cases ,",
    "the competitive exclusion takes place .",
    "in particular , in case ( iv ) , one population with starting advantage ( i.e. , its initial density is sufficiently larger than that of the other ) will eventually win , while the other will be extinct .",
    "in addition , in case ( ii ) or ( iii ) , one species always dominates the other .    in the past decade , besides deterministic models , stochastic ecology models have gained increasing attention to depict more realistically eco - systems .",
    "the main thoughts are that such systems are often subject to environmental noise .",
    "various types of environmental noises have been considered .",
    "general lotka - volterra models perturbed by white noise have been studied in @xcite , while the authors in @xcite go further by considering the effect of both white and colored noises to the lotka - volterra models .",
    "assuming that the population may suffer sudden environmental shocks , e.g. , earthquakes , hurricanes , epidemics , etc , bao et .",
    "al . in @xcite",
    "consider competitive system with jumps .",
    "meanwhile , tran and yin @xcite use a wonham filter to deal with a regime - switching lotka - volterra model in which the switching is a hidden markov chain . in the aforementioned papers , some nice estimates on moment and pathwise asymptotic behaviors have been given .",
    "some efforts have also been devoted to providing conditions for permanence and extinction of the species as well as the existence of stationary distribution .",
    "nevertheless , no conditions as sharp as their deterministic counterpart ( cf .",
    "proposition [ thm1 ] ) have been obtained .",
    "motivated by the needs , this paper aims to provide the classification for a stochastic competitive model that is similar to proposition [ thm1 ] .",
    "suppose that the coefficients of are subject to random noise that can be represented by brownian motions , the model becomes @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are independent brownian motions . to reduce unnecessary computations due to notational complexity and to make our ideas more understandable but still preserve important properties , we assume that the lowest - power terms are not affected by environment noise for simplicity , that is , @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the following model will be considered throughout the rest of the paper : @xmath29 similar to the deterministic case , we introduce two values @xmath30 that can be considered as threshold values and that can be calculated from the coefficients . we show that if both of them are positive , the coexistence takes place and all positive solutions to converge to a unique invariant probability measure in total variation norm . if one of the quantities is positive and the other is negative , then one species will dominate , the other will die out . in case",
    "both values are negative , each species will die out with a positive probability .",
    "another distinctive contribution of this paper is the demonstration of link of the threshold values and the lyapunov exponents .",
    "we demonstrate that when @xmath31 or @xmath32 converge to @xmath33 , their lyapunov exponents are precisely @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "it should be mentioned that some related results have been obtained for stochastic lotka - volterra models of predator - prey type ; see @xcite",
    ". however , the methods used in @xcite are not applicable to our model for two reasons .",
    "first , relying on the basic principle that the predator will die out without prey , there is only one threshold value determining whether the predator will be extinct or permanent .",
    "in contrast , our model requires to examine two values arising from the behavior of solutions leading to much more difficulty .",
    "second , in @xcite , the inter - specific terms were assumed not to subject to random noise so that the solutions in @xmath22 , the interior of @xmath36 , can be compared easily to the solutions on the boundary .",
    "it is not the case for our model .",
    "some new techniques will therefore be introduced to overcome the difficulty .",
    "moreover , it can be seen in our proofs that similar results can be obtained for the general model using our new method .    to proceed ,",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "we present our main results and provide some numerical examples demonstrating our findings in section [ sec : mai ] . because the proofs are quite technical , sections [ sec : coe ] and [ sec : com ] are devoted to the proofs for the coexistence and the exclusion cases , respectively . in section [ sec : pie ] , we treat a kolmogorov system of competitive type under telegraph noise . that section complements our earlier results in @xcite .",
    "we conclude with discussion on model and its variants .",
    "let @xmath37 be a complete filtered probability space with the filtration @xmath38 satisfying the usual condition , i.e. , it is increasing and right continuous while @xmath39 contains all @xmath40-null sets .",
    "we consider model , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are three @xmath44-adapted , mutually independent brownian motions .",
    "we suppose that @xmath45 are positive constants for @xmath46 .",
    "we also suppose that @xmath47 , @xmath46 so that the diffusion is non - degenerate . the degenerate case will be discussed later . throughout this paper , to simplify the notation , we denote @xmath48 , and @xmath49 we also denote @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
