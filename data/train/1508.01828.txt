    "heusler alloys have been attracted considerable attention due to their several possible applications , such as on spintronics @xcite , magneto - optics @xcite , magnetoeletronics @xcite , solar thermoeletrics and other technological devices @xcite .",
    "the physical properties for these applications , such as magnetization @xcite and the curie temperature @xcite , can be further optimized managing some parameters , as , for instance , lattice parameter and valence electrons numbers ( @xmath0 ) , in which are possible to be ruled by chemical substitution .",
    "an example of the above are alloys that were optimized to exhibit the curious memory shape behavior , defined as the ability of the material to come back to its original shape after deformed by a change in temperature and magnetic field ; found , for instance , on ni@xmath8co@xmath9mn@xmath10in@xmath11@xcite . also remarkable is the magnetocaloric effect around the magnetic transition temperature due to the occurrence of coupled magneto - structural transitions ; found , for instance , on non - stoichometric ni - mn - ga alloys @xcite .",
    "other important example is the half - metallicity , in which the alloy presents a gap in the minority band , working therefore as a perfect spin filter , since electrons at the fermi level are fully polarized .",
    "this feature is useful for spintronic purposes and is found , for instance , on fe@xmath1mnsi@xcite , fe@xmath1mnp@xcite and the high temperature ferromagnets co@xmath1mnsi and co@xmath1mnga@xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is thus to predict a multifunctional heusler alloy , with enhanced magnetocaloric effect at room temperature and half - metallicity .",
    "more precisely , the magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) has been studied by several researchers in order to develop magnetocaloric materials of low cost , good thermal conductivity , low electrical resistivity and mainly maximized magnetocaloric potential .",
    "the mce can be seen from either an adiabatic or isothermal process , both due to a change of the applied magnetic field . from an adiabatic process",
    ", the magnetic material changes its temperature ; while for an isothermal process it exchanges heat with a thermal reservoir .",
    "it is therefore possible to create a thermomagnetic cycle and a magnetic refrigerator based on these processes @xcite .",
    "some compounds that exhibit remarkable mce potentials are , for instance , manganites @xcite ; mnas - based compounds @xcite ; heusler alloys @xcite ; la - fe - si alloys @xcite ; intermetallics like rni@xmath1 ( r = nd , gd , tb)@xcite , rco@xmath1 ( r = er , tb)@xcite and prni@xmath2co@xmath3 @xcite ; and even diamagnetic materials like graphenes@xcite .    on the other hand , half - metal materials is one of the key rules to spintronics , since these materials are able to filter majority spins of an incoming non - polarized current .",
    "these are therefore useful for tunnel junctions , spin - injection and giant magnetoresistance devices@xcite , specially those with high curie temperature .",
    "more precisely , the tunnel magnetoresistance ratio ( tmr ) become theoretically infinity based on the julliere s model , for tunnel junctions using half - metals in both electrodes@xcite .",
    "the half - metallicity can be verified from either the theoretical density of states , obtained from first - principle methods , or the total magnetic moment of the compound , that must obey the generalized slater - pauling rule @xmath12@xcite , where the valence electrons number @xmath0 is written , for our case , as@xcite : @xmath13 above , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the valence electrons for each atom .    considering this scenario ,",
    "our aim is to provide a multifunctional heusler alloy , with half - metallicity and enhanced magnetocaloric effect , tuning thus this multifunctionallity with the valence electrons number @xmath0 . to this purpose ,",
    "our test bench materials are the si - rich side of the half - metallic series fe@xmath1mnsi@xmath2ga@xmath3 .",
    "the magnetic and structural properties of parent fe@xmath1mnsi and fe@xmath1mnga heusler alloys have been previously investigated @xcite .",
    "the former is a well know half - metallic ferromagnet alloy with @xmath18 around 224 k@xcite and @xmath19 spacial group ( cu@xmath1mnal type structure ) ; while fe@xmath1mnga is also a half - metallic ferromagnet with @xmath18 far above room temperature , around 800 k as previously reported @xcite , and crystallizes in the @xmath20 spacial group ( cu@xmath21au type structure ) .    in spite of different crystallographic structures of those parent compounds , it is possible to achieve single phase samples of the series fe@xmath1mnsi@xmath2ga@xmath3 ; however , only for the si - rich side up to 50% ; i.e. , the crystal structure of fe@xmath1mnsi parent compound supports ga substitution up to @xmath22 , with the lattice parameter @xmath23 increasing by increasing ga content@xcite . in spite of these finds ,",
    "the literature has no results on the magnetocaloric effect of these materials , but the curie temperature of this series was detailed explored by this group and reported in reference @xcite .",
    "this last was presented as a function of the valence electrons number @xmath0 and an interesting linear behavior was found ( see figure [ tc ] ) .",
    "thus , since the aim of the present work is to provide a multifunctional heusler alloy with enhanced magnetocaloric properties ruled by @xmath0 and half - metallicity , from figure [ tc ] it is straightforward to extrapolate the curie temperature to 300 k and verify that @xmath24 would bring the ferromagnetic transition up to room temperature ( a desired feature expected to optimize magnetocaloric materials ) .",
    "other studies connecting @xmath18 and @xmath0 confirm the linear growth tendency of these quantities for half - metallic heusler alloys @xcite .    ) as a function of the valence electrons number @xmath0 . the `",
    "+ ' signal marks the necessary @xmath0 value to reach @xmath18 at room temperature , found to be @xmath24.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    thus , as a consequence of the above reported , we must increase the valence electrons number @xmath0 to further optimize the magnetocaloric properties of half - metal heusler alloys . to achieve this goal ,",
    "either si or ga must be replaced by other element ( or elements ) that can contribute with more electrons ; i.e. , those elements belonging to , for instance , group 15 of the periodic table , such as p or as .",
    "these elements contribute with 5 electrons and can indeed increase the overall valence electrons number of the system . on the other hand , a substitution by a group 14 element , such as ge and sn",
    ", does not increase the overall valence electrons number for this series , since these have only 4 valence electrons ( the same valence electron number of si ) .",
    "in fact , zhang @xcite found values for @xmath18 between only 243 and 260 k in the same structural phase , by replacing si by ge in parental fe@xmath1mnsi compound .    from the above",
    ", we propose therefore fe@xmath1mnsi@xmath25p@xmath26 , since kervan and kervan @xcite conducted an _ ab initio _ calculations concerning the fe@xmath1mnp and confirmed the half - metallic features of the systems .",
    "polycrystaline ingots of fe@xmath27mnsi@xmath2ga@xmath28 heusler alloys were synthesized in arc furnace under ar atmosphere .",
    "the mass of the reactants of high purity were calculated in stoichiometric quantities , with exception of mn , which was added in excess of 3% from the stoichiometry to compensate possible losses during the melting process .",
    "this additional amount was found using the preparation process described in @xcite .",
    "the ingots were wrapped in tantalum foils , sealed in a quartz tube filled with argon and annealed for 3 days at 1323 k with subsequent quench in water to obtain single phase samples .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction data were obtained at room temperature using a bruker axs d8 advance diffractometer with cu - k@xmath6 radiation ( @xmath29 = 1.54056  ) at _ laboratrio de difrao de raios - x _ at uff and confirmed the single phase formation for all samples .",
    "energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) performed at _ laboratrio de caracterizao de materiais _ at if - sudeste mg was used to obtain the samples composition .",
    "the found average values are in very good agreement with the nominal composition .",
    "magnetization data were acquired as a function of temperature and magnetic field using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device ( squid , from quantum design@xmath30 ) at _ laboratrio de baixas temperaturas _ at unicamp .",
    "further details about samples preparation and structural characterization can be found in the reference @xcite .",
    "the physical quantities that measure the magnetocaloric potential are the magnetic entropy change @xmath31 and the adiabatic temperature change @xmath32 .",
    "the magnetic entropy change is more common to be found in the literature , since it only needs the magnetization map , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "thus , we performed magnetization measurements as a function of magnetic field for several temperatures around the magnetic transition temperature @xmath18 ( see figure [ mce]-left ) , for some selected compositions ( @xmath22 , 0.12 and 0.02 ) , chosen among those available on figure [ tc ] .",
    "from @xmath34 _ vs. _ @xmath35 isothermal curves it is possible to obtain @xmath31 accordingly to : @xmath36 the calculated values of @xmath31 are presented on figure [ mce]-right for @xmath5 = 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 and 50 koe .",
    "a really interesting result was then found by increasing @xmath0 ( replacing ga by si ) , in which the maximum magnetic entropy change increases . as mentioned above",
    ", the curie temperature also increases by increasing @xmath0 ( see figure [ tc ] ) , and therefore a shift towards higher temperatures on the magnetic entropy change peak is observed ( and expected ) .",
    "these results are clearly seen on figure [ mce]-left and summarized on figure [ ds ] .     for several values of @xmath5 and as a function of @xmath0 for fe2mnsi@xmath2ga@xmath3 series .",
    "the ` + ' signals mark the possible @xmath37 values of the proposed compound with @xmath18 close to room temperature .",
    "( right axis - color online ) scaling law to collapse the experimental data , ratifying therefore the validity of equation [ finalfwnfew ] and the parameters obtained from figure [ ab].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    from now on let us then focus on figure [ ds ] .",
    "note the maximum magnetic entropy change @xmath37 has a linear behavior depending on ga by si substitution , i.e , depending on @xmath0 ; and , for @xmath38 , it is expected to achieve 1.2 j / kg.k@20 koe , that would indeed be comparable to standard metallic gd ( 4 j / kg.k@20 koe ) .",
    "thus , the heusler alloy with @xmath38 would optimize the curie temperature , shifting @xmath37 towards room temperature , and , in addition , enhance the magnetocaloric properties ( see figure [ ds ] ) .",
    "let us see deeper into this result .",
    "note @xmath37 has a linear dependence with @xmath0 for any value of applied field change @xmath5 , but the slope and intercept parameters of these straight lines are @xmath5 dependent .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to propose : @xmath39 note therefore the value of @xmath0 for which @xmath37 goes to zero does not depend on @xmath5 and then @xmath40 ratio is a constant ( @xmath41 ) , i.e. , independent of @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , there is also a boundary condition : @xmath42 and thus we can write @xmath43 . taking advantage of these ideas , it is reasonable to propose : @xmath44 that leads to : latexmath:[\\[\\label{finalfwnfew }    above equation satisfies what we are observing .",
    "the point now is to obtain the parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath46 from the experimental results . to go further ,",
    "we then need @xmath47 and @xmath48 as a function of @xmath5 ; and these quantities can be easily obtained from the experimental data presented on figure [ ds ] - and these are shown on figure [ ab ] .     as a function of @xmath0 ( see figure [ ds ] ) .",
    "these parameters depend on the magnetic field change in a power law fashion @xmath49 ( see equation [ abequations ] ) , experimentally found to be @xmath50 , for both parameters @xmath23 and @xmath51 . from these dependence",
    "the empirical relationship on equation [ finalfwnfew ] could be obtained .",
    "the straight dotted line is a guide to the eyes , to verify the lack of linearity between those parameters and @xmath5.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    equation [ abequations ] were then fitted to the presented data on figure [ ab ] and the needed parameters were obtained : @xmath52 j / kg.k.koe@xmath53 , @xmath54 j / kg.k.koe@xmath53 and @xmath50 .",
    "an important point should be emphasized : each fitting has its @xmath46 exponent free to change and the experimental data lead those two ( one from @xmath23 and the other from @xmath51 ) , to the same value of 0.80(1 ) .",
    "it is an experimental evidence that indeed those straight lines on figure [ ds ] tend to the same value of @xmath0 for a zero @xmath37 value ; otherwise we could not factored @xmath55 as it is on equation [ finalfwnfew ] and , as a consequence , @xmath40 would be @xmath5 dependent ( contrarily to what was observed ) .",
    "to stress this idea , figure [ ds]-right axis presents @xmath56 and indeed this quantity collapses all of the magnetocaloric data into a single point .",
    "in the present paper we explored the si - rich side of fe@xmath1mnsi@xmath2ga@xmath28 heusler alloys and concluded that the valence electron number @xmath0 plays an important rule on their curie temperature and magnetic entropy change .",
    "increasing @xmath0 ( equivalente to increase the si content from fe@xmath1mnsi@xmath57ga@xmath57 compound ) , leads to a linear increasing of those both quantities .",
    "our conclusion is that @xmath38 would bring the curie temperature of the compound to room temperature , as well as promote an increasing on the maximum magnetic entropy change . from these results we could also propose ( based on the experimental data ) , an empirical linear relationship of the maximum magnetic entropy change @xmath37 with @xmath0 , weighted by a power law of @xmath5 , i.e. : @xmath4 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are constants experimentally determined . to achieve the goal of the present effort",
    ", we also propose to substitute ga by a group 15 element , like p ; and we expect that fe@xmath1mnsi@xmath25p@xmath26 would have their curie temperatures close to 300 k , with an enhanced magnetocaloric effect . in addition , it is know from reference @xcite that fe@xmath1mnp is a half - metal heusler alloy and therefore we expect that the above proposal leads , in addition to the enhanced mce properties , a half - metal system with the curie temperature close to room temperature .",
    "thus , this ideas can indeed lead to new multifunctional material , opening doors for further researches on this topic .",
