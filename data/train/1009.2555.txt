    "the cogent collaboration has announced detection of very low energy events which are not consistent with any known backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "one possible interpretation of these events is elastic scattering of a light dark matter particle ( @xmath5 gev ) with a spin - independent cross section , @xmath1 , on the order of @xmath6 @xmath7 (  @xmath8 )  @xcite .",
    "this is not very far from the region required to explain the annual modulation observed by the dama / libra collaboration  @xcite . a consistent interpretation of both the dama and observations  @xcite is for dark matter to have mass and",
    "cross section in a @xmath9 ellipse ranging from @xmath10 at @xmath11 down to @xmath12 at @xmath13 .",
    "clearly , it is of great interest to explore different kinds of dark matter models with regard to their ability to yield large @xmath1 for @xmath14 .    a number of groups have addressed this issue within the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite .",
    "however , given the structure of the mssm higgs sector and constraints thereon from lep and elsewhere , achieving the above cross section at low lsp mass is not possible  @xcite . a much higher local density of dark matter than the measured cosmological dark matter density , @xmath15  gev/@xmath16 , would be needed to bring the @xmath1 required to describe the /dama events down to the level possible within the mssm .",
    "basically , the problem is that the higgs with enhanced coupling to down quarks , whose exchange is primarily responsible for the elastic scattering of the lsp ( the lightest neutralino ) on a nucleon , must be rather heavy in the mssm context after imposing lep constraints . of course , a local density much larger than the cosmological average",
    "could be assumed so as to get the needed @xmath1 at low @xmath17 .",
    "however , there is a second problem . for low lsp mass",
    ", the mssm simply does not allow sufficient early universe annihilation to yield the observed cosmological average relic density once tevatron limits on @xmath18 are imposed  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is interesting to see if an extension of the mssm could allow the relevant higgs boson to have lower mass than allowed in the mssm , thereby achieving @xmath19 , while maintaining consistency with all constraints . in a previous paper  @xcite",
    ", we explored this question within the context of supersymmetric models with an additional generic chiral singlet superfield and found that this was indeed possible , the successful scenarios being ones in which both the lsp and exchanged higgs are substantially singlet in nature . in this paper , we focus on the concrete ( and more restrictive ) case of the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) .",
    "our conclusion will be that the observed cosmological relic density can be achieved while maintaining consistency with limits on @xmath18 but that the largest @xmath1 values that can be achieved for standard inputs regarding the @xmath2-quark content of the nucleon fall short of the preferred @xmath1 region of @xcite by a significant factor .",
    "in particular , in the strict nmssm , scenarios with a light singlet @xmath20 and largely singlet light higgs can not be realized at high @xmath21 while satisfying all other constraints .",
    "we also briefly discuss possibilities for enhancing the nmssm cross sections by enhancing the @xmath2-quark nucleon content or reducing the required @xmath1 using the recently proposed larger local density @xmath22 $ ]  gev/@xmath16 ( see @xcite for a summary ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ mssm ] , we outline the problems faced in the mssm . in sec .  [ extended ] , we discuss how the nmssm can potentially avoid these problems without violating the relevant collider constraints . in sec",
    ".  [ scans ] , we turn to a detailed discussion of the nmssm , including the point searching procedures we will employ and the constraints that must be obeyed . in sec .",
    "[ nmssm ] , we present the nmssm benchmark points we have found with large @xmath1 that satisfy all lep and babar limits .",
    "we then examine implications of various additional constraints from the tevatron , @xmath23 physics and @xmath4 for such points .",
    "we discuss some phenomenological issues for those points that survive all constraints . in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , we summarize our results and draw conclusions .",
    "in the mssm , there are two cp - even higgs bosons , the @xmath24 and the @xmath25 with @xmath26 . in the usual convention",
    ", one writes @xmath27 , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are the neutral higgs fields that couple to down and up type quarks respectively .",
    "an especially crucial parameter of the model is @xmath30 .",
    "relative to the sm higgs , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "the structure of the model combined with lep constraints require that @xmath35 . in this case",
    ", @xmath36 must be fairly small , especially at large @xmath21 .",
    "the combination of large @xmath21 and small @xmath36 implies @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "in this situation , the only way to get a large spin - independent cross section for lightest neutralino , @xmath20 , scattering on the nucleon is via exchange of the @xmath25 between the @xmath20 ( @xmath39 ) and the down type quarks contained in the nucleon ( @xmath40 ) . a rough formula for the spin - independent cross section",
    "was obtained in @xcite : @xmath41 where we have written @xmath42 . in the above",
    ", @xmath43 can not be much larger than @xmath44 because of limits on the @xmath45 invisible width . given that lep constraints basically force @xmath46 and that other constraints ( including @xmath47-quark yukawa perturbativity ) are very difficult to satisfy for @xmath48 , we see that the mssm is unable to obey all constraints and yield @xmath1 larger than a fraction of @xmath49 .",
    "in addition , one must consider whether the mssm allows for sufficient early - universe annihilation to achieve @xmath50 .",
    "to briefly review , the density of neutralino dark matter in the universe today can be determined by the particle s annihilation cross section and mass . in the mass range we are considering here",
    ", the dominant annihilation channel is to @xmath51 ( or to a lesser extent to @xmath52 ) through the @xmath2-channel exchange of the pseudoscalar higgs boson , @xmath53 .",
    "the thermally averaged cross sections for these processes are given by @xmath54 ^ 2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the width of the pseudoscalar mssm higgs .",
    "and although there are additional contributions from scalar higgs exchange , these are suppressed by the square of the relative velocity of the neutralinos , and thus are substantially suppressed in the process of thermal freeze - out .",
    "the thermal relic abundance of neutralinos is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom available at freeze - out and @xmath58 is the temperature at which freeze - out occurs : @xmath59 for the range of masses considered here , and for cross sections which will yield approximately the measured dark matter abundance , we find @xmath60 .    for @xmath61 gev , the relic abundance of mssm neutralinos is then approximately given by @xmath62 given that lep limits require @xmath63 and that @xmath21 as large as @xmath64 is already in the non - perturbative domain for the @xmath47-quark coupling , it requires a very extreme choice of parameters to get the measured dark matter density of our universe to be as small as that measured , @xmath65  @xcite . and , even with such extreme parameter choices , @xmath1 can be no larger than @xmath66 .",
    "of course , it is true that the same extreme choice of parameters that minimizes @xmath67 , bringing it close to the observed value , at the same time maximizes @xmath1 .",
    "however , there is a further barrier to achieving the minimal @xmath67 , maximal @xmath1 scenario . in particular",
    ", the above discussion does not yet include consideration of the tevatron limits on @xmath18 . in @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "3b ) , it was found that the mssm simply can not give the correct relic density for @xmath68 in the /dama region once the @xmath69 limit is imposed in addition to the lep limits .",
    "this situation motivates us to consider supersymmetric scenarios beyond the mssm . in the next section",
    ", we will demonstrate that in the nmssm it is possible to alleviate both the elastic scattering cross section and relic abundance problems found in the mssm .",
    "in the nmssm , one adds exactly one singlet chiral superfield to the mssm .",
    "as is well known , this allows a completely natural explanation for the size of the @xmath70 term @xcite and can reduce electroweak fine - tuning @xcite , and potentially catalyze electroweak baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "the nmssm superpotential is given by @xmath71 and the associated part of the soft lagrangian is given by @xmath72 the restriction to the forms given above is implemented by invoking a @xmath73 symmetry to remove all other possible terms . in particular , only the dimensionless @xmath74 and @xmath75 superpotential terms are allowed .",
    "all dimensionful parameters are generated by soft - susy - breaking .",
    "an effective @xmath70 value is automatically obtained as @xmath76 .",
    "this very attractive extension of the mssm allows for a considerable expansion of the phenomenological possibilities .",
    "in particular , the singlet superfield leads to five neutralinos , three cp - even higgs bosons ( @xmath77 ) and two cp - odd higgs bosons ( @xmath78 ) . in general , the neutralino mass eigenstates are mixtures of the mssm neutralino fields and the singlino field that is part of the singlet superfield ; the cp - even ( odd ) higgs mass eigenstates are similarly mixtures of the cp - even ( odd ) mssm fields and the cp - even ( odd ) components of the complex singlet scalar component of the singlet superfield .    within the nmssm",
    ", it is very natural for the lightest pseudoscalar higgs , @xmath79 , to have low mass ( see  @xcite ) . in particular , @xmath80 or @xmath81 symmetries",
    "can appear which lead to values of @xmath82 well below the electroweak scale .",
    "if one is close to either symmetry limit , the @xmath79 will be at least moderately singlet - like ( as opposed to being more purely mssm - higgs - like ) and will likely be beyond the reach of current collider constraints .    that a light @xmath79 in the nmssm can allow a very light dark matter particle in the  mass region with correct relic density was established in  @xcite .",
    "this is because the light @xmath79 @xmath2-channel annihilation process is typically fairly close to being on - pole , @xmath83 , as opposed to @xmath84 for the rather heavy @xmath85 of the mssm .",
    "however , in the scans performed in @xcite we did not encounter points with cross sections as large as those needed to describe the tentative /dama signal .",
    "we now describe a strategy for getting the largest possible cross section .",
    "to enhance the neutralino s elastic scattering cross section , we need a higgs mass eigenstate that is primarily @xmath86 ( so that it will have enhanced couplings to down - type quarks at large @xmath21 ) with mass lower than possible for the @xmath25 of the mssm . while this is not as easy to arrange in the nmssm as are low values of the lightest cp - odd higgs mass , it is still possible .",
    "the value of the down - type diagonal term of the nmssm scalar higgs ( squared ) mass matrix at tree - level is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the standard model higgs vacuum expectation value . at large @xmath21 , in order for this to fall significantly below the value of the up - type higgs entry ( which is generally @xmath89 , there must be some cancellation between the @xmath90 and @xmath91 terms .",
    "this cancellation also suppresses the mixing term between up - type and down - type scalar higgs bosons .",
    "the down - type mass can further be protected from large radiative corrections if the two stop masses are similar .",
    "together , these features can potentially lead to a down - type scalar higgs boson with a mass significantly below @xmath92 .",
    "the scenarios that can potentially lead to large @xmath1 are then ones in which the lightest of the nmssm higgs bosons , the @xmath93 , is not sm - like , has enhanced coupling to down - type quarks and has mass below @xmath94 .",
    "the @xmath95 will typically be sm - like and for @xmath96 below @xmath92 is typically not very heavy ",
    "@xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "lep limits will be very constraining in this situation .",
    "in addition , many @xmath23-physics constraints will enter as will constraints from @xmath4 .",
    "also important will be limits on @xmath101 production with @xmath102 and @xmath103 decays with @xmath104 .",
    "we will employ augmented versions of nmhdecay  @xcite supplemented by micromegas  @xcite ( the latter will be implemented as in nmssmtools  @xcite ) for our exploration of the nmssm parameter space .",
    "as noted , we have performed our scanning using an augmented version of nmhdecay linked to micromegas as in nmssmtools .",
    "nmhdecay currently incorporates all lep limits on higgs bosons as well as lep limits on neutralinos and charginos . to @xmath105 as in @xcite .",
    "] we have augmented  to include the recent aleph constraints  @xcite on @xmath106 with @xmath107 ( in our case @xmath108 , the lightest cp - odd higgs boson of the nmssm ) with @xmath109 .",
    "further , we have augmented nmhdecay to include the combined cdf+d0 tevatron constraints  @xcite on @xmath110 production with @xmath111 ( for the scans performed in this paper , it is constraints in the case of @xmath112 or @xmath113 that are typically relevant ) .   and @xmath53 are nearly degenerate whereas in most nmssm cases @xmath95 and @xmath113 are not degenerate , implying a somewhat weaker constraint on the separate @xmath114 and @xmath115 couplings . ] finally , in the scenarios with large @xmath1 the @xmath116 is inevitably light enough that @xmath103 decays will be present and , since @xmath21 is large , @xmath117 will be completely dominant .",
    "we have thus augmented nmhdecay to include the current d0 limits  @xcite on @xmath118 .",
    "also includes analysis of a large selection of @xmath23 physics constraints . for our purposes ,",
    "the most important ones turn out to be @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 .",
    "we have also augmented  to incorporate full babar constraints on @xmath122 with @xmath123 or @xmath109 as implemented in  @xcite .",
    "finally , we have examined the predictions for @xmath4 for high-@xmath1 cases . in our search for desirable points",

    "the @xmath124 and @xmath125 limits are treated somewhat differently . in the experimental papers ,",
    "the observed limits are plotted as a function of the relevant higgs mass in comparison to the expected limits .",
    "the expected limits have error bars that are partly statistical and partly systematic ( including theory systematics ) that have been combined in quadrature ,  assuming a gaussian distribution in particular for theoretical systematics . we believe that treating the observed limits in these cases as true limits is somewhat dubious . in our opinion , it would be much better to have separated the statistical errors from the systematic errors and ask what band about the observed limits would result from pushing all systematics in the least or most favorable direction . in the absence of sufficient information to carry out this task , we will simply assess the impact of relaxing the observed limits in the above channels by an amount equivalent to the @xmath126 or @xmath127 error bands ( as plotted relative to the expected limits ) relative to the observed limits .",

    "we believe that such a large shift is not consistent with current constraints and lattice calculations . at most , one might consider @xmath316 and @xmath317  @xcite , leading to an enhancement of about 50% .",
    "in fact , the preponderance of information suggests that , if anything , a lower value of @xmath318 is preferred leading to a decrease in the nucleon s @xmath2-quark content and thereby a decrease in @xmath1 .",
    "another possibility is to employ the larger average local dark matter density @xmath319 $ ]  gev/@xmath16 suggested in recent papers ( see the summary of @xcite ) instead of the micromegas default value of @xmath270  gev/@xmath16 .",
    "this would result in a @xmath320 decrease in the @xmath1 required to explain the /dama events .",
    "using both a 50% @xmath2-quark enhancement and the larger @xmath3 one could get about a factor of 2 decrease in the discrepancy between the nmssm predictions for @xmath1 and the @xmath1 values needed to describe the /dama observations .    for nominal @xmath2-quark content ,",
    "our results differ somewhat from the nmssm scan performed in  @xcite .",
    "their results for @xmath1 for @xmath321 are roughly a factor of 10 below ours .",
    "we believe that this is primarily because in their scenarios the @xmath93 is always sm - like , whereas in our highest-@xmath1 cases the @xmath93 has enhanced down - type quark coupling and it is the @xmath95 or @xmath169 that is sm - like .",
    "this means that their non - sm - like mainly @xmath86-like higgs , the @xmath95 in their case , is typically significantly heavier than in our scenarios . since @xmath322 a factor of 10 increase in @xmath1 can be achieved if @xmath323 is decreased by a factor of @xmath324 . for their scans ,",
    "the largest @xmath1 is achieved for @xmath325 $ ] , whereas our large @xmath1 values typically have @xmath326 .",
    "they obtain some gain in cross section since their typical @xmath166 is lower ( @xmath327 vs. our @xmath228 ) , leading to somewhat larger @xmath43 .",
    "the larger @xmath323 in the scans of @xcite imply a larger @xmath180 with the consequence that their largest @xmath1 points are within the nominal @xmath132 constraints from @xmath121 whereas our high-@xmath1 , @xmath321 points are about @xmath304 outside the @xmath132 region .",
    "we have examined parameter choices within the nmssm that are potentially capable of yielding a large spin - independent cross section for nucleon - lsp scattering at low lsp mass , consistent with that needed to describe the /dama observations .",
    "we have required that all lep and babar constraints be satisfied and that accepted points have correct relic density and sufficiently small @xmath69 .",
    "we have then examined the impact of additional constraints associated with tevatron observations , other @xmath23 physics observations and @xmath4 .    for standard assumptions regarding the @xmath2-quark content of the nucleons ,",
    "we have found that in the nmssm the largest spin - independent cross section that can be achieved for a relevant range of @xmath68 if @xmath321 is roughly a factor of 10 to 20 shy of that needed to describe the /dama event excesses assuming standard relic density , the latter corresponding to @xmath328 . in particular",
    ", @xmath1 for @xmath146 can be no larger than @xmath329 after imposing the tevatron constraints ( but allowing for a very mild violation in @xmath121 ) .",
    "if one allows for @xmath330 $ ]  gev/@xmath16 instead of @xmath270  gev/@xmath16 this will decrease the @xmath1 required to explain /dama by about 60% to perhaps as low as @xmath331 .",
    "nonetheless , our maximal @xmath1 values , of order @xmath332 for @xmath146 , would still be well shy of that needed .",
    "there is also some uncertainty in the @xmath2-quark nucleon content .",
    "it is possible to suppose that it could be enhanced by about 50% , although a 50% decrease is perhaps even more reasonable .",
    "combining a 50% increase with the larger @xmath3 , one would still be a factor of at least 5 short of explaining the /dama event rates .    for standard @xmath2-quark nucleon content ,",
    "the largest @xmath1 values found for @xmath151 are @xmath333 , within a factor of 3 to 5 of the needed ( assuming nominal @xmath15  gev/@xmath16 ) @xmath334 .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath151 nmssm parameter choices yielding such large @xmath1 all predict an anomalous magnetic moment for the muon that is strongly discrepant with the observed @xmath4 .",
    "nonetheless , it is not impossible that there is some resolution of this disagreement coming from physics beyond the nmssm .    we have illustrated that tevatron ( and , presumably soon , the lhc ) constraints on @xmath185 production and @xmath103 decays are highly relevant for constraining large-@xmath1 scenarios .",
    "thus , it is clear that if the  observations really are dark matter detection and if the nmssm is the relevant model , detection of one or more of the @xmath79 , @xmath93 , @xmath113 and @xmath116 of the nmssm at the tevatron and lhc should be close at hand in the above channels .",
    "however , it is also the case that detecting the sm - like higgs of these scenarios will be very difficult .    on another front ,",
    "in a companion paper  @xcite we have demonstrated that allowing an extension of the nmssm to include additional superpotential terms and/or soft - susy - breaking terms ( while still keeping just one singlet superfield ) will be sufficiently less constraining that @xmath1 values large enough to describe the  excess can be achieved without _ any _ lep , tevatron , babar , @xmath23-physics ( other than a quite small @xmath121 deviation ) or @xmath4 issues , and using nominal @xmath2-quark nucleon content and standard relic density @xmath3 .",
    "the key new feature is that the additional parameters allow scenarios consistent with all constraints for which the @xmath20 is highly singlet and the @xmath93 is largely singlet - like with large @xmath335 coupling and low @xmath96 .",
