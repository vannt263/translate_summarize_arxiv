    "for nearly 30 years the investigation of heavy - fermion systems ( hfss ) has been one of the most fascinating and interesting fields in condensed matter physics both experimentally and theoretically.@xcite the heavy - fermion phenomenon exists in a number of lanthanide and actinide compounds and manifests itself in the apparent existence of quasiparticles with very large effective mass @xmath4 at low temperatures @xmath5 .",
    "this is seen already in the specific heat , the electronic part of which shows the usual linear temperature dependence @xmath6 at very low @xmath5 for many metallic heavy - fermion systems but with a @xmath7 coefficient being 1001000 times larger than in usual metals . however , this @xmath7 coefficient itself is strongly @xmath5 dependent and rapidly decreases to `` normal '' values at higher @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , the static magnetic susceptibility @xmath8 crosses over from a curie law @xmath9 at high temperatures to a pauli - type behavior for very low @xmath5 : it approaches a finite value @xmath10 , which is also strongly enhanced compared to the pauli susceptibility of normal metals ; the ratio between @xmath7 and @xmath11 ( wilson ratio ) is of order @xmath12 , indicating that both enhancements are caused by the same physical processes .",
    "the heavy - fermion behavior is driven by the local moments of incompletely filled @xmath13 shells of the lanthanide or actinide ions . at high temperature , the weakly coupled @xmath13 electrons cause mainly incoherent and with decreasing temperature logarithmically growing spin - flip scattering for the conduction electrons . below a characteristic temperature scale , a crossover to a coherent low - temperature phase is observed .",
    "the @xmath13 electrons contribute significantly to the formation of heavy quasiparticles while their moments are dynamically screened .",
    "some heavy - fermion compounds such as smb@xmath14 or ce@xmath15bi@xmath16pt@xmath15 exhibit similar behavior at high temperature , but for low @xmath5 a crossover to an insulating heavy - fermion ground state with a narrow gap at the fermi energy is found.@xcite these heavy - fermion systems are termed _",
    "kondo insulators _ even though the insulating behavior is driven by fermi volume effects . in this case , the strong correlation induces only a narrowing of the band gap rather than the insulator transition itself as in mott - hubbard insulators .",
    "one particularly fascinating aspect of heavy - fermion compounds is that despite the existence of local moments they can undergo a superconducting phase transition , as observed@xcite in , e.g. , cecu@xmath2si@xmath2 . in other systems",
    "magnetic phase transitions are reported , with a large variety of types of order depending on the composition.@xcite in the weak - coupling or local - moment regime , the local @xmath13 moments tend to order antiferromagnetically , while in the kondo regime itinerant magnetism with an incommensurate ordering vector @xmath17 and strongly reduced ordered moments is observed.@xcite this crossover from local to itinerant magnetism has been studied in cecu@xmath18ge@xmath2 by variation of the coupling constant upon doping and has been attributed to the strongly temperature- and coupling - dependent residual quasiparticle - quasiparticle interaction .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we focus on the calculation of transport properties of heavy - fermion systems in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "characteristic information on heavy - fermion systems is obtained by measurements of the transport coefficients .",
    "the seebeck coefficient @xmath1 , or the thermoelectric power , is often nonmonotonic , can exhibit different extrema , and even sign changes @xcite related to particle - hole asymmetries .",
    "much of the recent interest in the heavy - fermion thermoelectricity is stirred by its large narrow peak at low temperatures which might be useful for solid - state cooling devices.@xcite    for high @xmath5 , the resistivity @xmath19 is determined by a negative temperature coefficient , and one usually observes a logarithmic , `` kondo''-like increase of the resistivity @xmath19 with decreasing @xmath5 . in kondo insulators , @xmath19 crosses over from low values to an activation behavior for smaller @xmath5 , reflecting the insulating ground state . in metallic heavy - fermion systems  for example , cepd@xmath15 ( ref .  ) , ceal@xmath15 ( ref .  ) , or cecu@xmath14 ( ref .  )",
    "a maximum is observed in @xmath19 before the resistivity approaches a small residual value for @xmath3 . at low temperatures @xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath19 often obeys a @xmath20 law in such materials .",
    "the logarithmic increase of @xmath19 above a characteristic low - energy scale @xmath21 ( for a discussion of low - energy scales see sec .",
    "[ sec : low - temperature ] ) is related to growing spin - flip scattering of the conduction electrons with decreasing temperature as a manifestation of the kondo effect .",
    "since the resistivity must vanish for @xmath3 in a translational - invariant system with a nondegenerate ground state , a maximum in @xmath19 must connect these two regimes .",
    "the observation of a @xmath20 behavior well below the characteristic temperature scale @xmath21 in combination with a strongly enhanced @xmath7 coefficient of the specific heat indicates the formation of a landau fermi - liquid by the heavy quasiparticles .",
    "we show in a comprehensive study that the low - temperature transport properties of heavy fermions can be understood in terms of a minimalistic model of interaction between local and itinerate degrees of freedom within the dynamical mean - field theory.@xcite spin - flip scattering between these degrees of freedom yields a logarithmically increasing resistivity with decreasing temperature .",
    "our calculations reproduce the experimentally observed maximum and the @xmath20 behavior at low temperatures characteristic of coherent transport in the fermi - liquid phase .",
    "the calculated optical conductivity exhibits a very narrow drude peak and an optical excitation gap characteristic of heavy - fermion materials.@xcite the midinfrared peak is located in the correct frequency range but with a too narrow width compared to the experiment@xcite due to the lack of local crystal electric field excitations in our model .",
    "we find very large absolute values for the thermoelectric power exceeding @xmath22 close to the kondo insulator regime at temperatures of the order of @xmath21 . in this case",
    ", the purely electronic figure of merit can be larger than 1 .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the thermoelectric power agrees very well with the typical experimental reported values .",
    "@xcite the sign changes of @xmath1 depend very sensitively on the particle - hole asymmetry and the band filling .",
    "also in the experiment , the details of the thermoelectric power vary strongly between different materials .",
    "@xcite    the experimental evidence @xcite compiled over the past ten years also indicates that even for heavy - fermion systems with a paramagnetic ground state , the temperature dependence of the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibilities often do not agree with the predictions of fermi - liquid theory.@xcite therefore , the phenomenological term `` non - fermi - liquid '' was attributed to such regimes appearing in a large variety of different materials . @xcite despite a tremendous experimental and theoretical effort it is , however , still not clear whether the non - fermi - liquid effects observed in heavy - fermion compounds are related to novel low - lying nonlocal excitations in concentrated systems , true local non - fermi - liquid physics @xcite or simply competing local energy scales . @xcite    the physics in heavy - fermion compounds",
    "is driven by the interaction between two distinct subsystems : localized , strongly correlated @xmath13 electrons hybridizing with extended conduction bands .",
    "the periodic anderson model ( pam ) takes these ingredients into account , comprising of spin degenerate conduction electrons , a lattice of correlated localized @xmath13 electrons and a hybridization ( cf .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) .",
    "the conduction electrons experience spin - flip scattering from the magnetic moments of the @xmath13 shells . on the other hand",
    ", the model also accounts for the rkky interaction between two localized magnetic moments in the particle - hole channel,@xcite leading to the competition between the kondo screening and magnetic ordering.@xcite while these qualitative aspects have been known for almost 30 years , a reliable calculation of the full phase diagram of the pam in more than one dimension has not been possible yet .    in this work",
    ", we apply the dynamical mean - field theory@xcite ( dmft ) mapping the pam on an effective single impurity anderson model@xcite ( siam ) , which becomes exact@xcite in the limit of infinite spatial dimension@xcite for lattice models of correlated electron systems . as",
    "impurity solvers for the effective siam we use wilson s numerical renormalization group@xcite ( nrg ) for all interaction strength and the modified perturbation treatment@xcite ( mpt ) for small values of @xmath0 .",

    "[ sec : diss - energy - scales ] ) : @xmath24 , with the dimensionless coupling @xmath25 , the spin - flip scattering rate @xmath26 , and @xmath27 being the density of states of the noninteracting conduction band of width @xmath28 at its band center .",
    "furthermore , the nrg provides detailed information on the possible fixed - point structure of the effective site .",
    "compared to other possible and frequently used dmft impurity solvers such as quantum monte carlo@xcite ( qmc ) , exact diagonalization ( ed ) , and noncrossing - approximation@xcite ( nca ) , the nrg and mpt have the advantage to be applicable also for very low temperatures .",
    "this seems to be essential for the reproduction of fermi - liquid behavior and simultaneously identifying the relevant low - temperature scale .",
    "the transport properties are calculated in the linear response regime using kubo formulas .",

    "we address the question of the existence of several low - temperature scales in the periodic anderson model which might manifest themselves in the transport properties .",
    "the quality of the dmft - nrg calculations is critically examined by a comparison with the modified perturbation theory in the weak - coupling regime ( @xmath32 ) , accurately described by the dmft - mpt .",

    "( [ eq : pam - hamil ] ) includes possible zeeman splitting of the energies in an external magnetic field @xmath46 , we set @xmath47 throughout the remainder of the paper and treat all properties as spin degenerate .",
    "even though only a single effective @xmath13 level is considered , this model is quite general .",
    "it describes any heavy - fermion system with odd ground - state filling of the @xmath13 shell , for which in a strong crystal field environment the degenerate hunds - rule ground state may be reduced to an effective spin - degenerate kramers s doublet .",
    "in addition , charge fluctuations to even @xmath13 fillings leave the @xmath13 shell in crystal field singlets .",
    "the hamiltonian contains four energy scales .",
    "the interplay between @xmath48 and @xmath0 controls the average @xmath13 filling as well as the local moment formation for large @xmath0 and negative @xmath48 .",

    "the uncorrelated system is an insulator at @xmath56 , since the lower of the two hybridized bands is completely filled . according to luttinger s theorem",
    "a finite @xmath0 of arbitrary strength does not change the fermi volume which includes the full first brillouin zone . as long",
    "as the ground state does not change symmetry due to a phase transition , the system remains an insulator at arbitrarily large coulomb repulsion .",
    "therefore , the nonmetallic ground state of kondo insulators is not correlation induced , but it is already present for the noninteracting system and a consequence of luttinger s theorem . for nonintegral values of @xmath57 , the paramagnetic phase of the system must be metallic .    in general , we can distinguish three different adiabatically connected regimes for @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "in the mixed valence regime , @xmath60 , the system is dominated by charge fluctuations yielding a nonintegral value of the @xmath13 filling @xmath61 . in the stable moment regime @xmath62 ,",
    "the @xmath13 electrons remain strongly localized and form a stable local moment , which tends to order antiferromagnetically due to the rkky interaction mediated by the conduction electrons .",
    "these two regimes are connected by the kondo regime for moderate ratios @xmath63 .",
    "the competition between screening of the local moment due to the kondo effect and the rkky interaction makes this crossover regime the most interesting one since it can lead to long - range magnetic order of the residual magnetic moments .",
    "spin - density - wave , metallic and superconducting ground states are observed in heavy - fermion materials@xcite which are believed to be described by the kondo regime .",
    "setting aside exact solutions in one dimension@xcite using the bethe ansatz for the kondo lattice model , to our knowledge no exact analytical solution has been found for the model ( [ eq : pam - hamil ] ) with finite @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , one has to rely on suitable approximations for the pam . an obvious first approximation is the assumption of a purely local , site - diagonal ( i.e. , @xmath64-independent ) self - energy , which for the pam is even better justified than for other lattice models of correlated electron systems , as the first corrections are at least of order @xmath65 . within a local self - energy approximation",
    "the complicated lattice problem can be mapped on an effective impurity problem ; i.e. , the pam can be mapped on an effective siam.@xcite such a mapping was first used already about 20 years ago in connection with applications of the nca ( refs .   and ) to the pam.@xcite a self - consistency condition accounts for the feedback due to the propagation of electrons through the lattice .",
