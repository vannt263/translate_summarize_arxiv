    "hidden markov processes ( hmps ) have gained widespread interest in statistics , predominantly due to their striking successes in applications .",

    "that is , solutions apply for all , but a subset of parametrizations which form a lower - dimensional subvariety in parameter space .",
    "the above - mentioned treatments usually raise extra assumptions on the processes , often centered around stationarity .",

    "the fact that one can assign every probability distribution @xmath3 $ ] over finite - length strings to a hmp on @xmath4 states ( which is a well - known exercise , the hidden states of the hmp form a de bruijn graph over @xmath5 , together with the obvious transition probabilities ) , introduces further complications when aiming at algorithmic solutions .",

    "see for example @xcite for discussions on bayesian networks , which , as latent variable models , are related with hidden markov models .",
    "since , as is well - known @xcite , hmps are uniquely determined by their distributions over strings of length @xmath10 , a solution of problem [ pro.finite ] also gives rise to a solution of the original problem [ pro.complete ] :    1 .",
