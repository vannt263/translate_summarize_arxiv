    "over 100 transiting planets have now been discovered and confirmed , and the kepler mission has contributed over 1200 additional candidates @xcite .",
    "transit observations provide a wealth of information about a planet s physical properties .",
    "the majority of known transiting exoplanets have arisen from ground - based surveys such as superwasp @xcite , hatnet @xcite , tres @xcite and xo @xcite .",
    "the majority of these planets are hot jupiters and are anything but standardized compared to each other , with respect to their density and orbital parameters .",
    "in particular several inflated hot jupiters have been discovered ( such as hd 209458 b , first detected by @xcite ) , with large radii relative to their masses .",
    "one explanation for this effect is tidal heating , which has been shown to inflate the radii of close - in planets even when the orbital eccentricity is very small ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "other proposed mechanisms include enhanced atmospheric opacities @xcite and ohmic dissipation @xcite , but none seem to be able to account for the entire sample of inflated hot jupiters .",
    "the transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey ( terms ) is a project which aims to refine the orbital parameters of intermediate - long period radial velocity planets and detect their transits @xcite .",
    "we present photometry for 6 of the wasp planets .",
    "these data were acquired in order to demonstrate the precision we can achieve for these and other terms targets in general with the ctio 1.0 m telescope , and to test the data reduction pipeline .",
    "all 6 are gas giants , with wasp-4b , wasp-5b , wasp-6b and wasp-6b orbiting g - type stars while wasp-29b orbits a k dwarf and wasp-31b orbits a f star .",
    "the six host stars have apparent magnitudes in the range 11.3 @xmath0 m@xmath1 12.6 .",
    "each system is interesting in its own right .",
    "wasp-4b @xcite , wasp-6b @xcite and wasp-31b @xcite are low - density , inflated planets .",
    "possible indications of transit timing variations @xcite have been reported for wasp-5b @xcite since its discovery @xcite .",
    "wasp-19b @xcite has the shortest period of all the known hot jupiters , and is thus extremely interesting from a dynamical point of view .",
    "@xcite is one of only a handful of saturn - mass ( and radius ) planets .    in this paper",
    "we independently derive parameters for these planets and their host stars , and provide updated ephemerides for each system based on the observed transits .    in section 2",
    "we describe the photometric observations and their reduction .",
    "the analysis of these data and the results are presented in sections 3 and 4 respectively .",
    "we summarize and discuss the results in section 5 .",
    "the observations were carried out at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) , with most of the data acquired using the 1.0 m telescope and the y4kcam ccd detector . the field - of - view of this instrument is 20@xmath220 and the readout time of the detector is 51 seconds .",
    "the earlier of two light curves for wasp-4 was obtained using the 0.9 m telescope which has a ccd with a 13.5@xmath213.5 field - of - view and readout time of 53 seconds .",
    "wasp-4 was observed on the night of october 12 , 2008 using a johnson v - band filter , and the night of september 10 , 2009 with a cousins r - band filter .",
    "the remaining 5 wasp targets were observed through a cousins r - band filter .",
    "the photometry for wasp-5 was obtained on the nights of august 31 , 2009 , and of september 8 , 2010 .",
    "the photometry for wasp-6 was obtained on the night of september 6 , 2010 .",
    "the photometry for wasp-19 was obtained on the night of january 18 , 2011 .",
    "wasp-29 was observed on the night of september 5 , 2010 .",
    "wasp-31 was observed on the night of january 25 , 2011 .",
    "detailed information pertaining to the observations can be found in table 1 .",
    "all images were bias subtracted and flat - fielded using skyflats . to increase the signal - to - noise per pixel and prevent individual pixel counts from exceeding the linear response range of the ccd , we defocussed the images to produce a relatively large point spread function , similar to that described by @xcite .",
    "the excellent guiding capabilities of the telescope allowed the stellar profile to remain on or near the same pixels such that accurate aperture photometry was able to be performed .",
    "aperture radii that corresponded to the extent of the point spread function , and sky annuli chosen so not to include any nearby stars were used for the photometry .",
    "we found that the photometry is relatively robust against the choice of these aperture radii . between two and four carefully selected reference stars",
    "were used in each case .",
    "reference stars were generally fainter than the target .",
    "brighter stars were often saturated ( the 0.9 m and the 1.0 m ccds are linear up @xmath340000 adu above bias ) because exposure times were optimized to obtain maximum flux for the target while maintaining the peak counts of the psf within the linear regime of the ccd .",
    "relative photometry was performed using the methods described in @xcite .    after performing aperture photometry on the transit of wasp-6b ,",
    "a trend was still visible in the light curve .",
    "the trend correlates with airmass and is likely due to different spectral types of the reference stars relative to the target . since the algorithm we used to fit the light curves ( see   [ sec : ana ] ) can only perform a linear correction for the airmass , we removed it by fitting a 2nd order polynomial to the out - of - transit data ( using time as the independent parameter ) and subtracting it from the entire light curve .",
    "we used tap ( transit analysis package ) developed by @xcite to obtain stellar and planetary parameters from our new light curves .",
    "tap accepts single or multiple light curves as input .",
    "the light curves are then fitted using the @xcite model by means of a markov chain monte carlo analysis . in the case of multiple transits , the parameters for each transit can either evolve together or independently .",
    "this allows , for example , to fit the transit midpoint of each transit separately while a single value is obtained for each of the remaining fitted parameters .",
    "we ran tap with the eccentricity ( _ e _ ) and the argument of periastron ( _ @xmath4 _ ) fixed to previously published values because these parameters are generally more accurately determined by radial velocity measurements , and because it is difficult to constrain their values using only one or two transits for each target .    the planet - to - star radius ratio ( _ r@xmath5/r@xmath6 _ ) , the scaled semi - major axis ( _ a / r@xmath6 _ ) , the inclination ( _ i _ ) and the time of mid - transit ( _ t@xmath7 _ ) were allowed to float .",
    "the period was fixed to the most recent published value ( as of may 2011 ) for each planet .",
    "we have also allowed the algorithm to fit for two additional parameters : uncorrelated ( white ) noise and correlated ( red ) noise .",
    "tap uses a wavelet likelihood function to more robustly estimate parameter uncertainties , particularly in cases where the light curve is affected by correlated noise @xcite . for each wasp light curve , we ran 10 chains of 10@xmath8 steps each , and removed the initial 10@xmath9 of each chain to account for burn - in .",
    "we have analysed all of our data with fixed limb darkening coefficients ( assuming a quadratic limb darkening law ) , using values interpolated from the tables of @xcite appropriate for each star .",
    "we have also repeated the analysis with _",
    "u@xmath10 _ and _ u@xmath11 _ as free parameters . since those two parameters are correlated , the uncorrelated linear combinations _ 2u@xmath12 u@xmath11 _ and _ u@xmath13 2u@xmath11 _ were fitted instead @xcite .",
    "for all six systems , the values of the parameters obtained when the limb darkening coefficients were allowed to float are only slightly different than those obtained by fixing the limb darkening coefficients , and they agree within uncertainties . in all cases , the fitted values of _",
    "u@xmath10 _ and _ u@xmath11 _ had large uncertainties ( @xmath14 0.3 for _ u@xmath10 _ and @xmath14 0.4 for _ u@xmath11 _ ) , indicating that our photometry does not improve upon the known limb darkening properties of these stars .",
    "these values were consistent with the @xcite values within uncertainties .    hence the parameter values we report have been obtained by fixing the values of the limb darkening coefficients , except for one of the wasp-4b analyses .",
    "while we acquired one transit for each of wasp-6b , wasp-19b , wasp-29b and wasp-31b , we observed and analysed two transits for each of wasp-4b and wasp-5b . for wasp-4b",
    ", we have analysed the light curves separately since they were taken using different filters .",
    "however , we have also performed a combined analysis of the two data sets in order to obtain more accurate and precise estimates of the stellar and planetary parameters . in this case",
    "we allowed the limb darkening coefficients to float , since fixing them is inappropriate due to the different filters . for completeness , we report the results of all three analyses of the wasp-4b light curves ( tables 3 and 4 ) . in the case of wasp-5b , we have analysed both light curves together and derived a single value for each transit parameter except the mid - transit time ( for which we obtained one value per transit ) .",
    "our transit light curves for the six planets are shown in figures 1 to 6 , respectively .",
    "since their discovery , new transit times have been published for both of wasp-4b and wasp-5b ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this wealth of data naturally invites transit timing variation analyses .",
    "however , we believe that for such an analysis to be consistent and as accurate as possible , all available transit photometry for a given system should be fitted using the same algorithm and the results analysed using the same method .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper , but we encourage such studies which are now becoming increasingly possible with the advent of online exoplanet databases such as the nasa star and exoplanet database @xcite .    for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "we combine the mid - transit times from our analysis with all previously published times to maximise the time span of observations , and use them to determine a new ephemeris for each system . for each of wasp-4b and wasp-5b",
    "we have acquired and analysed two transits .",
    "the two transits were observed about one year apart for each target . together with the fifteen published values for wasp-4b ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) we have a total of seventeen mid - transit points . for wasp-5b we combined thirteen published values ( @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) with our two for a total of fifteen mid - transit points .    for wasp-19b",
    ", we used three mid - transit times : two previously published values ( @xcite , @xcite ) and the one corresponding to the transit we have observed .",
    "@xcite did not report the mid - transit time corresponding to the transit they obtained on the night of 2010 february 28 because they performed a combined analysis of both that transit and the one presented in @xcite .",
    "we fitted the data obtained by @xcite ( private communication ) using tap ( as described in section 3 ) to obtain the mid - transit time .    for each of wasp-6b , wasp-29b and wasp-31b",
    ", we have one transit which we combined with the original published values ( @xcite,@xcite and @xcite , respectively ) for a total of two mid - transit points for each system .",
    "when necessary , these times were converted from jd@xmath15 ( our values ) and from hjd@xmath15 ( the discovery paper values ) to bjd@xmath16 using the online calculator developed by @xcite .",
    "we determined a new ephemeris by fitting a linear function to the mid - transit points for each system :    @xmath17=t_{0}[0]+np\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we chose to center the set of mid - transit times we used for each exoplanet so as to minimise the covariance between @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath19 .",
    "this means that the values of @xmath20 reported in tables 3 to 9 do not necessarily correspond to any of the mid - transit times in table 2 for a specific planet .",
    "the covariance calculated in this manner is sufficiently small for its influence in the calculation of the uncertainty on future mid - transit times to be negligible .          for each system , the values of the orbital eccentricity ,",
    "argument of periastron , velocity semi - amplitude ( _ k _ ) , stellar mass ( @xmath21 ) and planet mass ( @xmath22 ) were taken from previous publications ( see footnotes of tables 3 to 9 for details ) .",
    "these values together with the light curve parameters were used to calculate the remaining parameters in the tables .",
    "two of those quantities , the stellar density ( @xmath23 ) and the planet surface gravity ( g@xmath5 ) , can be obtained solely from the photometry .",
    "for @xmath23 we used the equation    @xmath24    from @xcite , where _ k _ is a constant coefficient for each stellar sequence , which relates the stellar mass and radius , @xmath25 is the planetary density , and _",
    "p _ is the orbital period .",
    "since @xmath26 is usually small @xcite , equation [ eqn : math1 ] becomes    @xmath27    we calculated g@xmath5 using    @xmath28    which is derived in @xcite .    in tables 3 to 9 we report our parameter estimates for the stellar and planetary properties .",
    "we present new photometry for six known transiting exoplanet systems : wasp-4 , wasp-5 , wasp-6 , wasp-19 , wasp-29 and wasp-31 .",
    "we have reduced the data and used tap - an interactive mcmc - based software package - to fit the transit photometry .",
    "the code robustly evaluates parameter uncertainties using a wavelet - based method for dealing with red noise in the light curves and fits for white and red noise , as well as any linear trend that may be present in the data ( due to airmass for example ) , in addition to the transit parameters .",
    "based on the photometry and radial velocity - derived parameters obtained from the literature , we compute and report new values for the orbital parameters , as well as the stellar and planetary properties of these six systems .",
    "specifically , we determine the mid - transit time , the scaled semi - major axis , the planet / star area ratio and the orbital inclination solely from our new photometric measurements . the values for the orbital eccentricity , the argument of periastron , the velocity semi - amplitude , and the stellar and planetary masses are adopted from the literature ( as described in the footnotes of tables 3 to 9 ) .",
    "the transit duration , the semi - major axis , as well as the stellar and planetary radii , densities and surface gravities were calculated from combinations of light curve parameters and parameters adopted from the literature .",
    "this work also constitutes the first follow - up observation paper for wasp-6b , wasp-29b and wasp-31b since publication of the discovery papers .",
    "all our parameter values - except the period - for the wasp-4 , wasp-6 and wasp-31 systems agree with those published by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite respectively , within the @xmath29 uncertainties , while the period agrees within the @xmath30 uncertainties in each case .",
    "the parameter values stemming from the combined analysis of the wasp-4 light curves ( table 4 ) agree better with the results of @xcite and are more precise than the parameter values based on the individual v - band and r - band light curves ( table 3 ) .",
    "all of our results for the wasp-29 system agree with those reported by @xcite within the @xmath29 uncertainties , and our uncertainties on the mid - transit time are smaller .",
    "the estimates of the planetary radius are of comparable precision , confirming its saturn - like size . for the wasp-19 system ,",
    "our values for all parameters agree with those reported by @xcite within the @xmath30 uncertainties .",
    "our value for the stellar radius of wasp-5 agrees with the value reported by @xcite ( hereafter f10 ) within the @xmath30 uncertainties , which in turn causes our value for the planet radius to be about 23 @xmath9 larger than that reported in the same paper .",
    "the remaining stellar and planetary parameters agree within the @xmath30 uncertainties .",
    "f10 analysed seven new transits together with all previously published transit photometry for this system , and detected a deviation from a linear ephemeris which , if real , corresponds to transit timing variations ( ttvs ) with an amplitude of up to 50 seconds .",
    "they also find a period which does not agree with previously published values within error bars , which can be considered as a possible indication of ttvs as well .",
    "our period value for wasp-5b is consistent with that determined by f10 within the @xmath29 uncertainties , but , like theirs , differs from those obtained by @xcite and @xcite within error bars ( @xmath29 uncertainties ) .",
    "we improve the ephemerides of wasp-4b , wasp-5b and wasp-6b and obtain a better constrained mid - transit time for wasp-29b .",
    "our ephemeris for wasp-19b is of similar precision to that reported by @xcite .",
    "our estimates of the mid - transit times for wasp-29b and wasp-31b and those obtained by @xcite and @xcite respectively , are of comparable precision .    having a long time span between our observations and the previous published mid - transit times , we update and refine the ephemerides for the six wasp systems we observed and analysed .",
    "our results are thus useful for planning future observations . in addition",
    ", they are consistent with previously published parameter values and as such serve to confirm the properties of these systems .",
