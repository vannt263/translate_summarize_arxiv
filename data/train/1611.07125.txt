    ". only one percent of uv selected galaxies at @xmath13 show strong nebular civ emission @xcite .",
    "while these systems tend to be low luminosity narrow line agns , more recent studies have shown that nebular civ is also found in dwarf star forming galaxies @xcite , presumably powered by the harder radiation field from low metallicity stars .",
    "the detection of nebular civ in one of the first galaxies targeted in the reionization era suggests that galaxies with hard ionizing spectra may be more common in the reionization era .",
    "+    there are two outstanding issues that must be addressed following these preliminary spectroscopic studies .",
    "first , it remains unclear how representative the @xmath12 civ emitter is of the greater population of star forming galaxies at @xmath14 .",
    "if stellar populations commonly produce hard ionizing spectra at @xmath6 , it would represent a rapid and qualitative change in the galaxy population relative to all lower redshifts , and these galaxies would play a larger role in reionization than has previously been assumed .",
    "second , one must attempt to establish whether the high - ionization emission is powered by hot , low - metallicity stars or agn .",
    "both can potentially provide high energy photons , and with a single metal - line detection it is difficult to prove the source beyond a reasonable doubt ( e.g. stark et al 2015b ) . at lower redshifts , the separation of agn and star forming galaxies",
    "is readily carried out using rest - frame optical emission line ratios ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however utilization of a similar approach at @xmath6 must await the launch of jwst .",
    "recent efforts have begun to develop rest uv diagnostics based on different photoionization models to distinguish the sources of ionizing spectrum @xcite . this can be achieved with current ground - based facilities , provided multiple far - uv lines can be detected .    in this paper",
    ", we describe initial results from a spectroscopic campaign using the magellan baade folded - port infrared echellette ( fire ; @xcite ) aimed at addressing the two issues described above .",

    "is powered by 4 ryd ionizing photons .",
    "photons with 4 ryd are also capable of triply ionizing oxygen , thereby decreasing the strength of oiii ] emission .",
    "the presence of strong oiii ] and civ emission indicates that rxc j2248-id3 must have an ionizing spectrum with significant power at @xmath65 ryd .",
    "but a rapid drop toward 4.0 ryd is required to maintain strong oiii ] emission and explain the absence of he ii .",

    "this follows naturally if the metal poor galaxies have spectra which are deficient in the 4 ryd photons which power he ii and triply ionize oxygen .    the origin of the line emission can be clarified further by comparison to photoionization models .",
    "figure 4b shows the line ratios of rxc j2248-id3 in the context of the agn and stellar models from @xcite .",
    "rxc j2248-id3 has log(oiii]/he ii ) @xmath67 , which is inconsistent with line ratios expected for agn ( log(oiii]/he ii @xmath68 to @xmath69 ) but can be easily explained by stellar models . in particular , a hard spectrum with steep drop above 4 ryd is characteristic of low - metallicity stellar populations .",
    "the precise metallicity required is dependent on the input stellar spectrum and may vary somewhat for single star models ( like those considered in @xcite ) and those that include binary evolution .",
    "the presence of civ in a two of the first few @xmath6 galaxies with deep spectra suggests that hard ionizing spectra may be more common in the reionization era .",
    "however when considering whether the civ emission in rxc j2248-id3 is typical , it is important to remember that the galaxy was selected to probe the low - mass regime where metallicities may indeed be systematically lower .",
    "the existence of ly@xmath2 may further bias this selection toward low - metallicity ( and thus dust ) as well .",
    "indeed , existing data at @xmath70 suggest that nebular civ emitters tend to be characterized by low stellar mass ( 2@xmath910@xmath71 - 1.1@xmath910@xmath72 m@xmath73 ) and large equivalent width ly@xmath2 emission , as would be expected if the stellar populations capable of powering high ionization lines are only found among young , low metallicity stellar populations .",
    "the nature of massive stellar populations at low metallicity remains poorly understood . theoretical work on massive star binary evolution ( e.g. , eldridge & stanway 2009 , de mink et al .",
    "2014 ) indicate that the lifetimes and high - energy ionizing output of massive stars at low metallicity may be vastly different ( and higher ) than classically assumed , potentially explaining the large luminosities now being detected in high ionization nebular lines .",
    "large samples of galaxies with intercombination metal line detections at high spectral resolution can constrain @xmath6 ly@xmath2 velocity offsets , a critical input for attempts to infer the igm ionization state from ly@xmath2 emitters .",
    "our measurement of @xmath74 km / s in a sub - l@xmath39 object ( m@xmath7519.8 ) at @xmath1 falls between existing measurements of high - luminosity objects with large ly@xmath2 offsets and low - luminosity objects with small offsets at @xmath6 . in a partially neutral igm",
    ", a large velocity offset will allow line radiation to redshift further into the damping wing by the time it encounters intergalactic hydrogen , thereby reducing igm attenuation relative to systems with smaller offsets .",
    "this m@xmath58-@xmath76 relationship ( figure 3b ) will thus help create a luminosity - dependent ly@xmath2 fraction , consistent with emerging measurements ( stark et al .",
    "this issue should be further clarified through increasing samples expected in the near future .    to summarize , the detections of civ and oiii ] in a @xmath77 galaxy point to a markedly different underlying stellar population in galaxies at @xmath6 relative to those studied at lower redshift .",
    "the detection of high ionization uv features in rxc j2248-id3 likely suggests that they are more common in the reionization era than previously expected .",
    "taken together , this implies that extrapolations from lower redshifts may be missing a significant and qualitative change in the nature of of photon production in the epoch of reionization ."
