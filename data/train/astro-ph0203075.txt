    "the alpha magnetic spectrometer , ams , is a space borne charged particle detector  @xcite that will be installed on the international space station in 2005 for three years .",
    "the primary goals of ams are to detect antimatter and dark matter , as well as to perform precision measurement of primary cosmic rays .",
    "these goals are closely related to astroparticle physics , especially in the matter - antimatter asymmetry , dark matter candidates , and atmospheric neutrino .",
    "this review begins with a short introduction to the ams .",
    "section 2 summarizes the physics results from the june 1998 shuttle flight .",
    "section 3 reviews the updated information about the two puzzles from ams measurements .",
    "section 4 discusses the influence of albedo particles on atmospheric neutrino and space science .    in june 1998 ,",
    "a prototype detector , called ams01 , was flown in space shuttle discovery on flight sts-91 .",
    "the major components of ams01 iclude a permanent magnet , time of flight detectors , and silicone trackers to provide measurements of charge , velocity and curvature .",
    "thus it can identify particles and antiparticles .",
    "in addition , there is an aerogel cerenkov threshold detector , which helps distinguish leptons from hadrons at high energy .",
    "the ams collaboration is constructing a new detector called ams02 .",
    "ams02 is upgraded with the following features .",
    "@xmath2    a super - conducting magnet replaces the permanent magnet .",
    "this would increase the magnetic field strength and maximum detectable rigidity by 10 times .",
    "a 8 layered silicone tracker replaces the 6 layered one .",
    "this would improve rigidity resolution .",
    "a ring image cerenkov counter ( rich ) replaces the aerogel cerenkov counter .",
    "an electromagnetic calorimeter and a transition radiation detector are added .",
    "a synchrotron radiation detector is being tested and will be added if it performs well .",
    "during the 1998 test flight , ams01 recorded approximately @xmath3 events .",
    "the physics results had been published in five journal papers  @xcite .",
    "one recent result of deuteron is presented at the 27th international cosmic ray conference  @xcite .",
    "the results related to cosmic rays are reviewed in this section .",
    "detailed information about data selection and background elimination can be found in original articles or in the review paper  @xcite .",
    "one of the major problems in the evolution of early universe is the disappearance of antimatter .",
    "the four requirements for matter - antimatter asymmetry are not fully complied .",
    "there are no positive evidences supporting the existence or absence of antimatter . a direct detection of anti - nuclei such as anti - helium or anti - carbon could signal the existence of antimatter .    under strict selection criteria ,",
    "no anti - helium was found and @xmath4 helium with rigidity of 1 to 140gv survives  @xcite .",
    "the antimatter limit at 95% confidence level is then estimated by assuming that anti - helium has the same spectrum as helium .",
    "the anti - helium limit is @xmath5 in the rigidity range of 1 to 140 gv .",
    "this result and some previous limits  @xcite are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : all - ahe ] . with the upgrade in magnet and longer operation time",
    ", the ams02 could reach the anti - helium limit to @xmath6 , three order of magnitude lower than that of ams01 .",
    "recent observation of cmb anisotropy measurements confirmed , once again , the existence of a large amount of dark matter .",
    "one of the candidates of dark matter , weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , could annihilate in the halo of galaxy and produce an excess of positrons .",
    "the ams can make indirect search of wimp through the detection of positrons .",
    "cosmic positrons come mainly from the decay of charged pions , which are produced by interaction of cosmic rays with interstellar medium .",
    "some of the early measurements of cosmic positron fraction show a suspicious peak above the expected flux of secondary origin at above 10 gev  @xcite .",
    "however , one recent high statistics experiment  @xcite fail to reproduce previous results .    for ams01 data ,",
    "the separation of positrons from large background of protons is limited by the poor performance of the aerogel cerenkov counter .",
    "the energy range is only up - to 3 gev .",
    "the ams fluxes of positron and electron  @xcite and the positron fraction , @xmath7 are consistent with most previous measurements  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : positron ] shows the cosmic positron fraction of ams01 and several previous measurements  @xcite .    the ams01 can not identify the possible positron signal from annihilation of wimp at higher energy .",
    "the new ams02 detector will add a ring imaging cerenkov detector and a calorimeter to enhance the chance of detecting this dark matter signal .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos come from the interaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere .",
    "the large acceptance and multiple sub - detectors of ams can make precise measurements of cosmic rays flux and composition . although the primary cosmic ray flux has been measured many times , the ams is the first instrument that measures cosmic rays globally .",
    "this information is essential to the calculation of atmospheric neutrino .",
    "the first study of protons  @xcite use data from two periods , one with the detector facing space ( downward events ) and one with the detector facing the earth ( upward events ) .",
    "the data are separated into 10 latitude bins , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pflux ] . for each bin ,",
    "the spectrum is a mixture of two spectra , a cosmic ray and a sub - cutoff component .",
    "section 3 will discuss the sub - cutoff components in detail .",
    "all the available data are used in a separate study  @xcite on primary cosmic ray proton .",
    "the rigidity is selected with @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the maximum of rigidity cutoff in the corresponding geomagnetic latitude , and the @xmath10 is the relative rigidity resolution at @xmath9 .",
    "the final spectrum , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : p_he ] , is fitted to the power law spectrum at rigidity @xmath11 gv .",
    "@xmath12 the differential spectrum index @xmath13 is @xmath14 and the normalization constant @xmath15 is @xmath16 @xmath17 .    for the study on cosmic helium flux  @xcite , 79 hours of data taken before shuttle landing were used .",
    "helium samples were selected with charged number @xmath18 .",
    "the major contamination comes from protons with mis - reconstructed charge , and it is estimated to be less than @xmath19 .",
    "the acceptance of detector was determined to be 0.1 m@xmath20 sr at rigidity @xmath21 20 gv and increased to 0.16 m@xmath20 sr at lower rigidity .",
    "the overall uncertainty of acceptance is 6% , which include uncertainties from trigger condition ( 4% ) , track reconstruction ( 3% ) , and particle interactions combined with event selections ( 2% ) .",
    "the cosmic ray events are selected when the geomagnetic rigidity cutoff of the @xmath22 of ams01 detector is less than 12 gv .",
    "the differential flux , shown in fig .  [ fig : p_he ] , was fitted to a power law spectrum at rigidity 20 gv to 200 gv .",
    "the differential spectrum index @xmath13 is @xmath23 and the normalization constant @xmath15 is @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "[ fig : p_he ] shows the cosmic proton and helium spectra of ams , several recent measurements , and spectrum used in the atmospheric neutrino calculation model .",
    "the ams spectra are consistent with those of previous measurements ; however , the hkkm-95 model  @xcite seems to have higher flux at energy above 20 gev . since the cosmic ray flux is the main input parameter of atmospheric neutrino simulations , it is difficult to compare the difference between results from groups using different models",
    ". inspired by the consistency between recent high statistic measurements from ams  @xcite , bess  @xcite , and caprice  @xcite , some groups proposed to use an unify spectrum  @xcite .",
    "cosmic light isotopes such as @xmath20d and @xmath1 play an important role in determining the mean amount of matter traversed by cosmic rays inside the galaxy .",
    "the excess of @xmath20d and @xmath1 comes from the spallation of heavy cosmic rays , @xmath26 or cno , interacting with interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "@xmath26 loses one nucleon and becomes @xmath27 or @xmath1 . at ams",
    "observed rigidity @xmath28 , the @xmath27 half life is only @xmath29 years , which is much smaller than @xmath30 years , the typical residence time of cosmic rays .",
    "so @xmath27 decays almost completely to @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath26 also breaks into two @xmath20d .",
    "@xmath20d and @xmath26 have the same rigidity for the same energy / nucleon , therefore , they suffer same solar modulation effect .",
    "the @xmath20d/@xmath26 is an important indicators for studying cosmic ray transportation in galaxy and solar system .    from the cosmic helium samples ,",
    "the helium mass histogram is fitted with two components , @xmath1 and @xmath26 .",
    "the result shows that 11.5% of helium is @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the cosmic ray flux ratio @xmath31 is approximately 13% , much higher than the primordial abundance @xmath32 .",
    "the deuteron samples are selected with charge + 1 and mass compatible with that of deuteron  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath33 histograms for several velocity bands for @xmath34 from 0.4 to 0.85 are fitted with those of proton and deuteron .",
    "approximately 10% of deuteron samples are proton with wrongly reconstructed velocity . after deducting this tail ,",
    "the chance of contamination from residual background of proton in the accepted deuteron samples is less than 1% .",
    "approximately @xmath35 cosmic deuteron samples are selected from geomagnetic latitude @xmath36 rad .",
    "the deuteron flux is fitted to the solar modulation model  @xcite .",
    "the best fit of the data is the local interstellar space ( lis ) spectrum index 2.75 and modulation parameter @xmath37 mv , consistent with the solar condition before the solar maximum in 20001 .",
    "the flux ratio @xmath20d/@xmath38 is employed to evaluate the effect of cosmic ray transportation effect .",
    "the ams measurement is consistent with the prediction of stephens  @xcite , who used the standard leaky box model , and was not in favor of some non - standard models such as re - acceleration theory  @xcite .",
    "charged particles having rigidity below geomagnetic cutoff can be trapped inside the geomagnetic field .",
    "some have energy low enough that their lowest altitudes are well above the atmosphere and they stay trapped for a long time .",
    "these particles form the radiation belts and have been studied quite thoroughly in the early years of space age .",
    "ams flew at an altitude approximately 380 km , well below the radiation belts .",
    "surprisingly , ams still observed many particles with rigidity below cutoff .",
    "for all the particles we studied so far , ( including p , @xmath20d , he , e@xmath39 , e@xmath40 ) , all their spectra contain two components , cosmic rays and sub - cutoff particles . unlike the trapped particles in radiation belts ,",
    "these sub - cutoff particles originate from and return to atmosphere in a very short time , less than 20 seconds  @xcite .",
    "they also have some interesting features  @xcite .",
    "two puzzling phenomena left unanswered in the ams publications  @xcite .",
    "the secondary albedo particles are produced in air shower .",
    "the decay chain of @xmath41 , produce positrons , electrons , muons , and atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the positron electron asymmetry also creates great interest among physicists working on atmospheric neutrino simulation .",
    "several groups had developed monte - carlo simulation to study the production and transportation of albedo particles .",
    "the first puzzle and the most surprising result from ams01 is the albedo positron electron ratio  @xcite .",
    "the flux ratio @xmath0 varies with magnetic latitude and can be as large as 4 near the magnetic equator .",
    "some balloon experiments , operated in high latitude regions , obtained a ratio of approximately 1 .",
    "most of the radiation belts experiments in the 60s and 70s could not distinguish between electrons from positrons .",
    "however , the presence of positrons in the radiation belts had been reported as early as 1983  @xcite .",
    "ams measures at higher energy ( @xmath42 gev ) , almost one order of magnitude higher than that in previous radiation belts experiments .",
    "the excess of antimatter raises questions concerning their origin . at high latitude , these albedo positrons could have rigidity higher than the cutoff and be mistaken as cosmic rays .",
    "huang ( 1998 )  @xcite proposed the first quantitative model of the positron electron ratio . for positive charged cosmic rays ,",
    "the rigidity cutoff are lower from the west than that from the east .",
    "therefore , more cosmic rays coming from the west than from the east . because of the geomagnetic field , @xmath43 coming from the west and @xmath44 coming from the east have better chance to move upward .",
    "the combination of higher ( lower ) fluxes from the west ( east ) and secondary @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) moving upward produce the positron electron asymmetry .",
    "the difference in rigidity cutoff decreases with increasing magnetic latitude so does the flux ratio . using this model and",
    "the observed @xmath0 , huang ( 2001 )  @xcite derived the arrival direction of primary cosmic rays must be near west ( for albedo @xmath43 ) and east ( for albedo @xmath44 ) , respectively .",
    "monte - carlo simulations  @xcite had reproduced the @xmath43 and @xmath44 fluxes and the @xmath0 as a function of magnetic latitude .",
    "they provide information about the arrival direction of primary cosmic rays .",
    "those results confirmed the theoretical prediction from huang ( 2001 )  @xcite .",
    "the second puzzle is that 90% of albedo helium is @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 had been observed in radiation belts by onr  @xcite at kinetic energy 40 - 100 mev / n and sampex  @xcite at kinetic energy 10 - 20 mev / n .",
    "both experiments observed low energy particles trapped inside radiation belts .",
    "the ams observation is in the high energy region and particles stay in space for a very short time , @xmath45 20 seconds , compared with the life time of trapped particles , which is much longer than days .",
    "cosmic ray @xmath26 nuclei interact with air nuclei , they break up into @xmath1 , whose rigidity would be times that of @xmath26 .",
    "when the incoming @xmath26 has rigidity less than about times the cut - off rigidity , the @xmath1 fragment , having rigidity smaller than the cut - off , turns into an albedo  @xcite .",
    "huang and stephens  @xcite simulate the interaction of cosmic helium with atmosphere .",
    "the result shows that @xmath1 produced by spallation exists only in specific phase space of rigidity and magnetic latitude .",
    "only few events near @xmath46 and energy @xmath211 gev / n can be explained by this mechanism .",
    "selesnick and mewalt  @xcite proposed that protons in radiation belts picking up one neutron from helium in the upper atmosphere may be able to explain the light isotopes in radiation belts .",
    "however , the radiation belt protons are not energetic enough to produce the @xmath1 as observed by ams .",
    "huang and stephens  @xcite modified this model using cosmic ray protons . although @xmath1 could be produced in low latitude and rigidity ranges similar to the ams measurements , there are some serious difficulties .",
    "first , the ambient helium density is too low to produce @xmath1 flux comparable with that measured by the ams .",
    "second , the spectrum is too steep at energy higher than 0.5 gev / n .",
    "derome and bunerd  @xcite also analyzed the light isotopes , such as deuteron , @xmath1 , @xmath27 , from their simulations .",
    "the coalescence model is used to explain the production of @xmath1 .",
    "the incident proton gets absorbed in the atmospheric nitrogen or oxygen to form a compound nucleus , which decays to various light nuclei .",
    "the individual nucleons must be close to each other in order to form a nuclei .",
    "therefore , the probability of forming heavier nuclei is much less then that of forming lighter nuclei .",
    "this model explains successfully the existence of albedo proton , @xmath20d , @xmath1 , and @xmath26 .",
    "pugacheva et al .",
    "@xcite also had a similar explaination of hydrogen and helium isotopes in radiation belts .",
    "their model can be employed to understand the @xmath1 observed by ams .",
    "the albedo proton , as shown in the bottom of fig .",
    "3 , could also produce air shower and contribute to the atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "since the albedo flux is approximately 1% of the primary cosmic ray flux , the contribution should be in the same order of magnitude or less  @xcite",
    ". a good simulation should be able to explain all the features of albedo particles , including particle types , spectra , spatial and temporal distributions .",
    "however , plyaskin  @xcite claimed that his simulation reproduced the albedo positron electron ratio and up - down asymmetry of atmospheric neutrino without neutrino oscillation .",
    "this simulation uses an approach quite different from the others .",
    "plyaskin used the geant simulation code and reduced the size of the earth and the atmosphere into something similar to the size of an detector in accelerator experiment .",
    "he reported a large excess of contribution coming from the scattered protons which enter the atmosphere from the forbidden cone , where belong to trapped particles .",
    "these scattered particles are not counted in traditional simulation algorithms .",
    "it is suspicious that the large contribution from scattered protons may be the cause of his condensation of atmosphere and amy disappear in realistic case .",
    "although the current simulations reproduce most of the features of albedo particles . there remain some questions .",
    "the main argument is whether ams or monte - carlo simulations over - counted the long flight time ( lft ) events .",
    "while the lft events passed through the ams altitude many times , they were detected in one position only .",
    "some simulations counted the flux as from one single particle , others simulations counted each passage through ams altitude .",
    "the drift period of albedo particle in gev range is approximately 10 second , much shorter than the 90-minute period of the space shuttle .",
    "ams could not detect the same particle twice , therefore , ams did not over - count the lft particles .",
    "another question is the precision of simulation .",
    "the differences between mc simulation and experimental data are much larger than the error bars .",
    "discrepency is the greatest near the cutoff and high latitude regions .",
    "it simply shows that much remains to be learnt concering the penumbra region ( an intermittent transition zone from trapped particles to cosmic rays )  @xcite .",
    "there is certainly much room for improvement in the monte - carlo simulations .",
    "space engineers must design proper shielding for satellites or astronauts to reduce the ionization radiation caused by the charged particles in space .",
    "there were models of proton and electron fluxes in radiation belts , such as ap8 and ae8  @xcite .",
    "the albedo particles have energy close to the minimum of ionization energy loss and could penetrate deep inside the protection layer .",
    "this effect had not been considered yet . in recent years",
    ", space physicists have regained interests in the high energy components in radiation belts . with the large acceptance and particle identification capability",
    ", ams could be the most powerful detector compared with other radiation belt experiments .",
    "the ams provide a global measurement of high energy particles , the measurements could be used to reconstruct a useful model . however , the current data are not very helpful .",
    "although the energy loss in detector materials had been restored to the `` original energy '' by deconvolution using bayes theorem  @xcite , this is only a statistical correction .",
    "particles entering the detector suffer different amount of energy loss .",
    "also the effect of residual magnetic field is not corrected .",
    "those two corrections change the pitch angle and energy distributions .",
    "so the current flux of albedo particles could have large systematic error and can only be used for crude estimation .",
    "some of the mismatches in ams measurements and mc simulations might come from the simplification of deconvolution .",
