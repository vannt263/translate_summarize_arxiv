    "it is well known that cp violation can be introduced in the standard model ( sm ) with three or more generations , provided one allows for complex yukawa couplings . for a long time",
    "the only experimental evidence for cp violation came from the kaon sector . recently , one has had experimental evidence for cp violation also in the b sector . yet",
    ", cp violation continues being one of the least experimentally constrained aspects of the sm . since the breaking of cp is closely related to one of the least theoretically understood sectors of the sm , namely the higgs sector and the generation of fermion masses and mixings , it is clear that the study of cp violation , both theoretically and experimentally , is likely to play a major r^ ole in the future development of particle physics .",
    "the following three independent cp observables have been measured @xcite :    \\(i ) kaon sector :    @xmath0    \\(ii ) b sector @xmath1 @xmath2",
    "\\(iii ) baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) @xmath3 the results ( i ) , ( ii ) are in agreement with the standard model ( sm ) and its kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) mechanism of cp violation . on the other hand ,",
    "it is by now established that the strength of cp violation in the sm is not sufficient to generate the observed bau @xcite .",
    "an essential feature of thooft s solution of the @xmath4 problem @xcite , is the fact that the qcd lagrangian has to include a term :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a free parameter .",
    "the inclusion of this term is crucial for the solution of the @xmath4 problem , but it leads to another difficulty , due to the fact that @xmath8 , violates p , t and cp , while conserving c. in the sm , the quark mass matrices @xmath9 are generated through spontaneous symmetry breaking of the @xmath10 gauge symmetry and they are , in general , arbitrary complex matrices which are diagonalized by a bi - unitary transformation acting on left - handed and right - handed fields .",
    "these transformations include in particular the chiral transformation necessary to make @xmath11 diagonal , real which induces a contribution to @xmath7 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 as a result , @xmath14 is the physical parameter which measures the strength of cp violation in non - perturbative qcd , leading in particular to an electric dipole moment ( edm ) for the neutron . in chiral perturbation theory ,",
    "the following result has been obtained @xcite for the neutron @xmath15@xmath16 the experimental bound on @xmath17 implies the following bound on @xmath18 :    @xmath19    why should a dimensionless free parameter like @xmath18 , be so small ?",
    "this is the so - called strong cp problem .",
    "various solutions to the strong cp problem have been put forward , including the following :    * @xmath20 solution + this would be the simplest solution .",
    "if the up quark were exactly massless , then @xmath18 could be set to zero by making a chiral transformation of the up quark field .",
    "the difficulty with this solution stems from the fact that it has been shown by gasser and leutwyler @xcite that the up quark mass does not vanish .",
    "it is worth pointing out that a different point of view has been expressed by other authors @xcite .",
    "* peccei - quinn solution + peccei and quinn have pointed out @xcite that if there is a global chiral symmetry @xmath21 under which both the quarks and the higgs multiplets transform trivially , the @xmath18 parameter becomes a dynamical variable which can be set to zero .",
    "it was pointed out by weinberg and wilczek @xcite that since @xmath21 is a global continuous symmetry which is spontaneously broken by the vacuum , there is a goldstone boson , named axion , which acquires mass through instanton effects .",
    "the original axion has been immediately ruled out by experiment and so far , none of the its variants have been discovered .",
    "the peccei - quinn suggestion is clearly one of the most elegant solutions to the strong cp problem .",
    "its main drawback , is the fact that axions have not been experimentally discovered yet .",
    "* solutions with calculable and naturally small @xmath18 + in this class of solutions , one imposes cp ( or p ) invariance at the lagrangian level and chooses a higgs potential so that cp ( or p ) is spontaneously broken .",
    "the cp ( or p ) invariance of the lagrangian requires @xmath22 . if appropriate symmetries are added to the lagrangian so that @xmath23 vanishes at tree level , then @xmath18 equals zero at tree level and receives small , calculable contributions in higher orders .",
    "a specially attractive scenario in this class of theories is the one proposed by barr and nelson @xcite , which can be implemented in the context of grand unified theories or in the framework of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "although the sm and its km mechanism of cp violation is in agreement with all the data in the kaon and b sectors , there is motivation to consider new physics contributions to cp violation , namely :    \\(i ) the fact that the strength of cp violation in the sm is not sufficient to generate the observed bau provides a strong motivation to consider new sources of cp violation , beyond the km mechanism . whether the new sources of cp violation needed to generate",
    "the correct bau will be  visible \" at low energies ( e.g. through the study of cp asymmetries in b - decays ) , is an open question .",
    "it depends very much on the origin of these new sources of cp violation . if these new contributions to cp breaking arise , for example",
    ", from low - energy supersymmetry or due to the presence of z - mediated flavour - changing neutral currents @xcite , then it is likely that they will manifest themselves as deviations from the sm predictions for cp asymmetries in b - decays .",
    "however one may generate the correct bau through a completely different mechanism like , for example , baryogenesis through leptogenesis @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "a lepton asymmetry is initially generated by the decay of right - handed neutrinos and it is then converted into a baryon asymmetry by @xmath24 - violating sphaleron processes . in this case , the relevant sources of cp violation have to do with the coupling of right - handed neutrinos @xcite and therefore the predictions of the sm for cp asymmetries in b - decays will not be affected .",
    "\\(ii ) almost all extensions of the sm include new sources of cp violation .",
    "for example , in supersymmetric extensions of the sm , there is a large number of new phases which may play a rle in cp asymmetries in the b system @xcite as well as through their contribution to various edms .",
    "there are two ways of introducing cp violation in gauge theories @xcite :    @xmath25 * at the lagrangian level : *    in this case , the lagragian is such that there is no transformation that may be physically interpreted as a cp transformation , under which the lagrangian is invariant .",
    "the minimal model of this class is the 3 generation standard model with complex yukawa couplings , where the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) mechanism takes place .    @xmath25",
    "* spontaneous cp violation : *    two conditions have to be satisfied in order to achieve spontaneous cp violation :    \\(i ) there is a transformation that may be physically interpreted as cp , under which the lagrangian is invariant .",
    "\\(ii ) there is no transformation that may be physically interpreted as cp , under which both the lagrangian and the vacuum are invariant .",
    "the minimal model of this class is the lee model , with two higgs doublets and with flavour changing neutral currents in the higgs sector .",
    "we will discuss this model in subsection 3.2 .      in the sm the yukawa couplings are in general @xmath26 complex matrices in flavour space , with @xmath27 denoting the number of fermion generations .",
    "upon spontaneous symmetry breaking of the @xmath10 gauge symmetry , these couplings lead to complex quark mass matrices @xmath11 for the up and down quarks , respectively .",
    "these mass matrices are diagonalized by bi - unitary transformations : @xmath28 in the mass eigenstate basis , the charged currents can then be written as : @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "the mass terms are : @xmath31 one has the freedom to rephase the quark fields :    @xmath32    under the above rephasing , the mass terms remain invariant , while @xmath33 transforms as : @xmath34 where we have dropped the suffix @xmath35 .",
    "it is obvious that only rephasing invariant quantities have physical meaning .",
    "the simplest rephasing invariant functions of @xmath36 are moduli and invariant quartets : @xmath37    assuming a non - degenerate quark mass spectrum , the most general cp transformation for the quark fields which leaves the lagrangian invariant , is : @xmath38    it can be readily verified that cp invariance constrains all rephasing invariant functions of @xmath39 to be real .",
    "in particular , cp invariance implies that @xmath40 . for two generations",
    "there is only one quartet and unitarity constrains its imaginary part to vanish .",
    "indeed @xmath41 implies @xmath42 and thus : @xmath43 for three or more generations , unitarity does not constrain @xmath44 to vanish and therefore cp violation can arise .",
    "this is the km mechanism .",
    "unitarity of @xmath33 plays a major rle in restricting the strength of cp violation in the sm and it implies a series of relations which can be used to test the sm , with the potential of uncovering new physics . let us consider orthogonality of the first two rows of @xmath33 : @xmath45 multiplying both sides of eq .",
    "( [ vud ] ) by @xmath46 , and taking imaginary parts , one obtains : @xmath47 similarly , one can prove that all @xmath48 have the same value for any of the invariant quartets of the @xmath49 @xmath33 matrix .",
    "this is a very special feature of the @xmath49 unitary @xmath33 matrix , which would not hold true if , for example , there were four fermion generations .",
    "the quantity @xmath48 can then be used as a measure of the strength of cp violation in the sm .",
    "furthermore , @xmath48 has a simple geometrical interpretation .",
    "to each of the six unitarity relations corresponding to orthogonality of rows and columns of @xmath33 , one can associate a triangle in the complex plane , as in fig.1 .",
    "all the unitarity triangles have the same area , which is proportional to @xmath48 : @xmath50 under rephasing of quark fields , the triangles rotate and thus the orientation of the unitarity triangles has no physical meaning . however the internal angles of the unitarity triangles are invariant under rephasing and do have physical meaning .",
    "of special interest , is the triangle corresponding to orthogonality of the first and third columns of the @xmath35 matrix , represented in fig.1 .",
    "this triangle has the special feature of having all sides of comparable size .",
    "furthermore , in the context of the @xmath51 , the internal angles of this triangle are related to various @xmath52 asymmetries in b - meson decays .",
    "the angles @xmath53 are represented in fig.1 and are defined by : @xmath54 one can derive necessary conditions for cp invariance in the sm , with an arbitrary number of generations , written in terms of weak - basis ( wb ) invariants .",
    "these invariants have the advantage that they can be evaluated in any wb .",
    "an example of such a wb invariant condition for cp invariance is @xcite :    @xmath55 ^ 3 = 0 \\label{trh}\\ ] ]    where @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "for two fermion generations eq .",
    "( [ trh ] ) is automatically satisfied with arbitrary hermitian matrices @xmath58 .",
    "this is , of course , to be expected since for the two generation sm , cp can not be broken . for three generations ,",
    "( [ trh ] ) is a necessary and sufficient condition for cp invariance .",
    "this wb invariant can be evaluated in terms of quark masses and mixings : @xmath55 ^ 3 = 6i ( m_t^2 - m_c^2 ) ( m_t^2 - m_u^2 ) ( m_c^2 - m_u^2 )   ( m_b^2 - m_s^2 ) ( m_b^2 - m_d^2 ) ( m_s^2 - m_d^2 ) i m q \\label{xyz}\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( [ xyz ] ) it follows that in order for cp violation to take place , no two quarks of a given charge can be degenerate",
    ". however , there is cp violation in the sm even in the limit where the mass of a given quark , for example @xmath59 , vanishes .",
    "an alternative way of introducing cp , t violation is having a lagrangian which is cp and t invariant but a vacuum which breaks cp , t. in the sm , it is not possible to achieve spontaneous cp violation ( scpv ) .",
    "the minimal extension of the sm where scpv can be obtained is the lee model @xcite , where the gauge sector of the sm is not changed but in the higgs sector , two scalar doublets are introduced .",
    "it has been shown that there is a range of parameters of the higgs potential for which the minimum is at : @xmath60 the minimum of eq .",
    "( [ vev ] ) does conserve electric charge but it violates cp and t. at the time when lee suggested this model , there were only two fermion generations , so cp breaking originated only in higgs mediated interactions . in the case of three fermion generations , it can be readily verified that the relative phase @xmath61 leads to cp violation both through neutral higgs exchange and in charged weak interactions @xcite .",
    "this can be shown by considering the yukawa interactions : @xmath62   d_r - \\bar q_l [ \\gamma_1^ { ' }   \\tilde { \\phi_1 } + \\gamma_2^ { ' } \\tilde { \\phi_2 } ] u_r + h. c.\\ ] ] where @xmath63 denote the left handed quark doublets .",
    "the yukawa couplings @xmath64 are real matrices , so that cp invariance holds at the lagrangian level . upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking , one obtains the following quark mass matrices : @xmath65 from eqs .",
    "( [ ms ] ) one can compute @xmath58 and verify that the wb invariant of eq .",
    "( [ xyz ] ) does not vanish in general , thus showing that in the lee model with three fermion generations , cp is violated by charged weak interactions through the km mechanism , in spite of the existence a single phase in the model , namely the phase @xmath61 . on the other hand , since quarks of a given charge receive mass from couplings to two different higgs , there are flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) mediated by neutral higgs .",
    "these couplings do lead to cp violation , as shown by lee . in summary , in the lee model with three fermion generations and two higggs doublets , there are two sources of cp violation , the usual km mechanism and higgs exchange",
    ". the appearance of fcnc can be avoided by introducing extra discrete symmetries which constrain the yukawa couplings in such a way that , for example , @xmath66 only gives mass to down quarks while @xmath67 only gives mass to the up quarks . in this case",
    "higgs mediated neutral currents are naturally diagonal .",
    "however , the introduction of this discrete symmetry in the lagrangian , forbids the presence of some terms in the higgs potential in such a way that cp can not be broken spontaneously @xcite .",
    "one encounters a similar situation in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , where cp can not be spontaneously broken . in the context of minimal extensions of the sm , one can have natural flavour conservation ( nfc ) in the higgs sector ( i.e. , absence of fcnc due to a symmetry rather than by fine tuning ) and yet achieve spontaneous cp violation @xcite , by introducing a third higgs doublet , which does not couple to quarks . in the context of supersymmetric extensions of the sm , spontaneous cp violation can be obtained in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm)@xcite with the introduction of a gauge singlet field . in both the above described schemes , the imposition of nfc in the higgs sector , together with the requirement of spontaneous cp violation , leads to a real ckm matrix @xcite and cp violation arises exclusively from physics beyond the sm .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the above scenario of having a real ckm matrix is a very special case which results from the simultaneous requirement of spontaneous cp violation and nfc in the higgs sector .",
    "when one considers extensions of the sm , the generic situation one encounters is having the coexistence of the km mechanism with new sources of cp violation .",
    "as we have seen , this is the case of lee s model , where besids the km mechanism , one has a new source of cp violation , arising from higgs exchange .",
    "apart from its failure to account for the observed bau , the sm and its km mechanism of cp violation is in agreement with all the presently available experimental data .",
    "this agreement is an impressive success of the sm , which can be described in the following way .",
    "let us adopt the standard parametrization of the ckm matrix , with three angles @xmath68 and one phase @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "the three angles @xmath70 can be readily obtained from the knowledge of @xmath71 which can be extracted from kaon and b - meson decays . once these angles are fixed , one has to fit a large amount of data namely @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , with a single parameter @xmath69 . in the near future ,",
    "babar and belle will have much more precise data on @xmath76 and hopefully will measure other cp asymmetries leading to the determination of @xmath77 . in lhc , the measurement of @xmath78 will be possible @xcite , as well as a significant improvement on the precision of all other asymmetries . when all this data will become available",
    ", the sm and in particular its km mechanism of cp violation will be subjected to a very stringent test , with the potential for discovering new physics . in considering the effects of new physics ,",
    "it is useful to make the following reasonable assumptions :    \\(i ) one assumes that the quark decay amplitudes @xmath79 , @xmath80 as well as the semileptonic @xmath81 decays are dominated by the sm tree - level diagrams .",
    "this assumption is satisfied in most of the known extensions of the sm . in practice",
    ", this means that the extraction of @xmath82 from experimental data will continue being valid even in the presence of new physics .",
    "\\(ii ) one allows for the possibility of having new physics to @xmath83 and @xmath84 mixings .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , because in the sm , @xmath85 mixing receives contributions only at loop level and therefore new physics can give additional contributions of comparable strength .",
    "it is useful to parametrize the total contribution to the mixing as : @xmath86^{sm } r_q^2 e^{+ i \\phi _ q }   \\label{m12}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 stands for @xmath88 . from eq .",
    "( [ m12 ] ) it follows that @xmath89 and or @xmath90 signals the presence of new physics .",
    "the main effect of the presence of new physics contributions to @xmath91 is that the asymmetries @xmath92 , @xmath93 will no longer measure the angles @xmath94 but instead the following relation will apply : @xmath95 due to the constraints of unitary of the ckm matrix , the sm flavour sector is quite constrained since various measurable quantities ( which are in general independent ) are related within the framework of the sm .",
    "any deviation from these sm relations will signal the presence of new physics .",
    "an example of such a relation is the aleksan - london - kayser @xcite relation : @xmath96 with @xmath97 defined by @xmath98 .",
    "the importance of eq .",
    "( [ akl ] ) has been emphasized by silva and wolfenstein @xcite .    in a large class of models beyond the sm , in particular in the supersymmetric extension of the sm",
    ", the @xmath49 unitarity of @xmath33 continues to hold .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that unitarity of @xmath33 is an assumption which should be tested experimentally .",
    "deviations of @xmath49 unitarity naturally arise in models with vector - like isosinglet quarks @xcite , i.e. quarks whose left - handed and right - handed components are both singlets under @xmath10 .",
    "in the next few years crucial new data will be provided by the various b factories . with this new data , one will be able to test the flavour sector of the sm to a great level of accuracy .",
    "these experimental tests have the potential of discovering new physics , specially if one takes into account that the sm is highly constrained .",
    "as we have emphasized , within the sm , a series of in principle independent measurable quantities are parametrized by a single parameter , namely the km phase @xmath69 . even in the event that no deviations from the sm predictions are found , future data on the various cp asymmetries as well as on @xmath99 mixing",
    "will still have a great impact , since they will lead to a precise determination of the @xmath33 matrix , specially of its smallest elements , namely @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "this will in turn have important implications for theories of flavour . in some of these theories , family symmetries",
    "are introduced which lead to calculability of @xmath33 in terms of quark mass ratios .",
    "some of these models differ from each other precisely in their predictions for @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , the measurement of these matrix elements within the sm will have the potential to select the correct theory of flavour .    in conclusion , the future data from b - factories will have a great impact on the physics of flavour and cp violation .",

    "special thanks are due to carlo bosio and gino saitta for the efforts to make the workshop a great success .",
