    "double tearing modes ( dtm ) are coupled tearing modes on adjacent resonant surfaces which effectively `` drive each other '' @xcite . the resulting instability is stronger than a single tearing mode ( stm ) , whereby modes with high poloidal mode numbers @xmath0 may become dominant @xcite .",

    "a more recent application is related to the formation of internal transport barriers ( itb ) in advanced tokamaks .",
    "dtms were suggested to be involved in this process due to the fact that itbs are often observed in the vicinity of resonant surfaces or near @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it was found that dtms with any mode number @xmath0 become similar to @xmath7 internal kink modes @xcite when the distance between the resonant surfaces is sufficiently small @xcite .",
    "this is reflected by the linear growth rate @xmath8 scaling with the magnetic reynolds number @xmath3 as @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "when the distance between the resonant surfaces is large , the structure of the instability resembles that of individual stms localized on each resonant surface . in this case , the scaling law is @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was found that the coupling in a dtm may also destabilize linearly stable tearing modes @xcite and speed up the growth of magnetic islands in the nonlinear regime @xcite .",
    "the instability of dtms may be enhanced by effects like anomalous electron viscosity @xcite , finite beta and sheared toroidal flows @xcite .",
    "poloidal shear flows , on the other hand , may have a stabilizing effect @xcite , raising the possibility of a dynamical interplay between shear flows and dtms @xcite .",
    "this idea is supported by recent studies which indicate that mhd activity associated with multiple resonant surfaces may produce a significant amount of sheared poloidal flows @xcite .    until now , studies related to dtms in cylindrical ( or toroidal ) plasmas were focussing mainly on the role of the modes with the lowest poloidal and toroidal mode numbers , @xmath0 and @xmath11 .",
