    "there has been a persistent discrepancy among the theoretical prediction and the experimental value for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath0 with @xmath1 , at the @xmath2 level  @xcite which may call for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "however , to reach to such conclusion , higher precision is required .",

    "this may become the dominant theoretical uncertainty , which at the moment is estimated as @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the hvp , the hlbl can not be directly related to any measurable cross section , and again requires the knowledge of qcd at all scales , which is represented in fig .  [ fig : h2g]b by the grey blob .",
    "being a multi - scale problem , it is not possible to rely on a perturbative @xmath10 expansion .",

    "the last are based on the use of data at low energies , but lack the ability to implement the high - energy constraints . in our study , we propose a mathematical framework which allows to make full use of data and high - energy constraints and describe , in a model - independent fashion , the required quantities for calculating the @xmath12 and @xmath13 contribution to the hlbl , which represents the dominant piece . for this , we extend the approach based on pad approximants described in refs .",

    "it is extremely important to provide a precise description at these scales around @xmath37  gev .",
    "in addition , specially for the first term in the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hlbl ] ) which is uv - divergent for a point - like tff , it is important to provide the adequate high - energy behavior dictated by perturbative qcd which is the drawback in dispersion relation approaches .",
    "this makes a clear statement that , for reaching a precise determination for this quantity , we need to provide a precise description of the pseudoscalars tffs at very low - energies together with the appropriate high - energy behavior , which are the main concerns of our approach discussed below .",
    "achieving a tff description from first principles is extremely challenging , if not impossible , at the moment . on the one hand , at the very low energies involved in the process , one could think about resorting to a chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath39pt ) approach .",
    "however , any description beyond a constant tff requires many unknown low - energy constants and violates unitarity at high energies .",
    "moreover , the convergency of this expansion breaks down much before the first resonance scale , still relevant in our integral . for details on a @xmath39pt - based calcualtion for the hlbl ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , for very large energies , we can rely on perturbative qcd . in this framework ,",
    "the tff is obtained in terms of a convolution of a hard - scattering amplitude with the pseudoscalar distribution amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the latter object , which is of non - perturbative nature , encodes the @xmath24 structure and must be modeled , inducing potential large uncertainties . consequently ,",
    "the only reliable limits at disposal are  @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41  mev is the pion decay constant  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to find an alternative approach able to link both , the low and the high energies as well as controlling the theoretical uncertainties . for this ,",
    "some models , such as hidden local symmetry  @xcite , resonant chiral theory  @xcite , or large-@xmath11 based generalizing vector meson dominance ideas  @xcite have been proposed .",
    "their qualitative agreement may be understood from the large-@xmath11 limit of qcd , where green s functions are expressed in terms of an infinite number of resonances exchange  @xcite .",
    "they lack however the estimation of the theoretical error which is associted to their model or simplifying assumptions , and the deeper question remains on whether it would be possible in these models to reproduce the tff to arbitrary precision .",
    "it was proposed however in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the agreement of this approaches can be understood as well from the framework of pad theory .",
    "the advantage of the latter is that , for certain kind of functions , it allows to go beyond the large-@xmath11 limit , and approximate the real world qcd function .",
    "actually , these properties have already been exploited for dealing with the hvp  @xcite and it has been shown that they allow to estimate the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we propose to use this framework for reproducing the tff arising in the pseudoscalar exchange contribution to hlbl as well  @xcite .",
    "+ given an analytic function with known series expansion , say , @xmath42 , pad approximants ( pa ) are rational functions of two polynomials , @xmath43 and @xmath44 of degree @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , constructed such as to match the original series expansion up to order @xmath47 terms  @xcite , @xmath48.\\ ] ] pad approximants can be proven to approximate not only meromorphic functions which represents the large-@xmath11 limit of qcd but stieltjes functions as well  @xcite .",
    "these kind of functions may have threshold discontinuities and often represents cases of physical interest  @xcite .",
    "pad theory guarantees then the convergence of some kind of sequences @xmath49 in the whole complex - plane except for the discontinuity itself , where the original function is ill - defined .",
    "these theorems provide then a mathematical corpus of the model - indepedendency of our approach as the known analytic structure of tff seems to fall in this kind of functions  @xcite . in this respect",
    ", we are going a step further with respect to previous approaches , guaranteeing the ability to reproduce , to arbitrary precision , the tff .",
    "note that this holds for some previous approaches in the strict large-@xmath11 limit of qcd alone  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the systematic construction , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pa ] ) allows to estimate the theoretical uncertainty  @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : pa ] ) , before we can apply the method . in this respect",
    ", it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that pas can be used as well for this purpose in order to safely extract the low - energy parameters from experimental data for the space - like and low - energy time - like tff . in refs .",
    "@xcite , we were able to extract in this way some of the leading parameters for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 , allowing us to reconstruct the first approximants and obtain valuable information , as the @xmath25 and @xmath13 mixing parameters .",
    "this allows to safely reconstruct the tffs at that low - energies where often no data is available .",
    "+ so far , this provides a description for the single virtual tff @xmath50 .",
    "however , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hlbl ] )  and  ( [ eq : hlblff ] ) , we find that it is the most general doubly - virtual tff @xmath51 that we require in our calculation .",
    "to describe this , we need to extend the pas to the bivariate case for symmetric functions , which are known as canterbury approximants ( ca ) , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "they are constructed , similarly to pa , from the original series expansion and the simplest approximant reads  @xcite @xmath52 with @xmath53 the tff slope and @xmath54 given by the doubly - virtual expansion @xmath55 .",
    "as already discussed in the introduction , there is at present not available experimental data for the doubly - virtual tff , which would allow to extract the low - energy parameters in a similar manner as for the single - virtual tff .",
    "this means that we can not go to large approximants .",
    "then , we stick for the moment to the simplest element eq .",
    "( [ eq : ca ] ) and judge , based on theoretical constraints , a reasonable range in which the real @xmath54 parameter would lie be contained . on the one side , at low energies , @xmath39pt offers indications that the tff should factorize  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath56 , implying then @xmath57 . on the other side , at large energies , the ope condition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tffhe ] ) , suggest that @xmath58 so that the high - energy behavior is fulfilled .",
    "guided by this hints , we choose an even more conservative range @xmath59  @xcite , which we believe is generous enough to consider possible departure from factorization at higher energies range was confirmed in recent dispersive analysis for the @xmath25 case  @xcite ] . of course",
    ", ultimately , experimental data will have the last word on this .",
    "let us remark though , that either of the above - mentioned choices have small impact at low energies see discussion from the authors in the proceedings of chiral dynamics 2015 .",
    "with the doubly - virtual behavior incorporated , we can come back to the hlbl contribution . using our chosen band for the double virtual parameter @xmath54 , which we stress , not only considers the correct low - energy behavior , but account as well for the high - energy one ( i.e.",
    ", it reproduces for @xmath58 the power - like behavior in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tffhe ] ) ) , we obtain the preliminary results for their contribution to hlbl , @xmath60 , in table  [ tab : g2res ] .",

    "we remark that ope behavior was not considered for the @xmath25 and @xmath13 cases in the reference numbers from refs .",
    "@xcite which used a factorization approach based on resonance ideas which are not required in our framework .",
    "we find that the error on this assumption may not be negligible , i.e. at the order of the projected experimental precision @xmath74 .",
    "the overall uncertainty is dominated by the @xmath24 contribution , whereas the @xmath25 result has been greatly improved as compared to ref .",
    "this has been possible thanks to the new low - energy parameters extraction in ref .",
    "@xcite including , for the first time , not only the space - like , but the time - like data from the precise dalitz decay measurements from a2  @xcite collaboration at mainz .",
    "this illustrates the potentiality of the method to benefit from very different experimental regimes . in principle",
    ", new precise data from the @xmath24 tff would allow for a similar improvement . in this respect , we are currently working on the impact of new data on these errors  @xcite .",
    "accounting for our quoted range we obtain that  @xcite @xmath75 where the lower(upper ) values come from @xmath76 choice .",
    "we stress that , at this point , it is not possible to choose either factorization or ope as this would be in contradiction either with the high- or low - energy behavior .",
    "this is a peculiarity of the lowest approximation and calls for the use of the @xmath77 approximant , which already has the ability to implement both behaviors  @xcite .",
    "we remark that we do not consider the so called off - shell effects  @xcite in our calculation .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite in this respect .",
    "so far , this represents our best estimate , which global uncertainty is clearly dominated by the chosen @xmath78 window , arising from our ignorance about the doubly - virtual tff .",
    "this is greater than our uncertainty estimation , @xmath79 , and twice as big as the projected experimental @xmath4 uncertainties @xmath80 .",
    "this clearly illustrates the necessity of measuring the doubly - virtual tff if we aim to achieve a similar precision as projected experiments .",
    "this should answer the question on how fast the tff reaches the ( doubly - virtual ) high - energy behavior and would allow for the @xmath77 determination .",
    "given the lack of knowledge both from the experimental side , where no data is available , and the theoretical side , which offer no answer yet , we consider in the next section the @xmath19 decays , which as we argue , offer an indirect probe to this question .",
    "whereas experimentally it is very difficult to probe the doubly - virtual tff , limited by the low cross sections together with current achieved luminosities , there is an alternative indirect path to probe this .",
    "this possibility is brought , in analogy to new physics in @xmath4 , through loop mediated processes which , being sensible to the tff at the whole energy scale , provide us the opportunity to test high - energy effects in low - energy phenomena . in this case",
    "such possibility is brought by the pseudoscalar decays into lepton pairs , @xmath19 , for which @xmath20 .",
    "this process appears at leading order through the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pll ] .     the leading order qed contribution to the @xmath19 process where @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath81 stands for the transition form factor.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as such , the tff must be integrated at all energies offering the desired indirect probe .",
    "the branching ratio ( br ) for this decay may be expressed in terms of the two photon decay width as @xmath82 where @xmath83 represents the loop amplitude ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for details ) @xmath84 which is unknown as far as the normalized tff @xmath85 is unspecified .",
    "the role of the doubly virtual tff is actually rather important as the given integral , similarly to the hlbl case , is uv - divergent .",
    "remarkably , for the @xmath24 case , it is possible to go further without a single clue on the tff .",
    "being the lightest hadron , it is not possible to find any additional intermediate hadronic state which may be on - shell , and contribute therefore to the imaginary part .",
    "consequently , its imaginary part is solely given by the intermediate @xmath16 state , which gives @xmath86 inducing the so called unitary bound  @xcite for the br , @xmath87 , which for the @xmath24 gives @xmath88 .",
    "this provides a model - independent lower bound , which violation would certainly imply physics beyond the standard model .",
    "+ experimentally it is found that , after removing the radiative corrections  @xcite , @xmath89 which is certainly ( quite ) above the unitary bound .",
    "still , latest results on rc  @xcite suggest @xmath90 .",
    "nevertheless , they can not yet justify such deviation , which would still imply some kind of new physics and has attracted much attention  @xcite .",
    "+ often , the unitary bound has been extended to the @xmath25 and @xmath13 cases in order to provide an estimate for experimental searches .",
    "a word of caution comes here .",
    "while for the @xmath24 this was a firm result , this is not the case for the heavier @xmath25 and @xmath13 mesons , which masses allow to include hadronic intermediate states such as @xmath91 or even @xmath92 for the heavy @xmath13 .",
    "we find small corrections for the @xmath25 to the unitary bound , but large corrections to the @xmath13 as the imaginary part is reduced by @xmath93 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and our proceedings in chiral dynamics 2015 ) .",
    "+ to go further and provide an estimation for these processes , we need to input some description for the tff . then , checking with the experimental values , we can find whether our description , assuming that new physics do not play any role here , corresponds to the experimental world . if this turns out not to be the case , it is possible that our understanding of the doubly - virtual tff is not as good as we believed .",
    "once more , the crucial observation in this process is the dominance of the low - energy space - like @xmath94 region which fully dominates the integral , see ref .  @xcite .",
    "this process is perfectly suited then for our ca description .",
    "taking our quoted @xmath78 range , we obtain the preliminary results in table  [ tab : pll ] .    llll process & br@xmath95 & br@xmath96 & ref",

    "+    we provide the combination of both , statistical and systematic errors . for details on these , see refs .",
    "we find that , for the @xmath24 , previous results have probably underestimated their theoretical errors when modeling the doubly - virtual tff  @xcite .",
    "actually , this feature applies for the @xmath25 and @xmath13 cases as well  @xcite , where not only the double virtuality , but the single - tff have been crudely modeled  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we find for the @xmath25 and @xmath13 remarkable deviations with respect to previous results  @xcite arising from the approximations adopted in previous calculations  @xcite , which can not be neglected for the @xmath25 and @xmath13 decays . finally , it is worth reminding that integral  ( [ eq : loop ] ) is sensible as well to the time - like region up to the @xmath111 mass .",
    "this feature is of special importance for the @xmath13 .",
    "it can be shown that our method is able to effectively reproduce threshold effects there and we are safe to perform such calculation  @xcite , which is an important and distinctive feature in our approach not implemented so far . + we find from our results that both the @xmath97 and the @xmath112 decays show deviations from their experimental values , at @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "remarkably , the latest bounds on @xmath106  @xcite are reaching our predictions see the talks at this conference .",
    "therefore , we encourage our experimental colleagues in novosibirsk to further pursue this decay . note that including radiative corrections alleviate the first result , leading to @xmath115 .",
    "yet its statistical significance , that represents a potential large deviation and , for the moment , the only clue about the doubly - virtual tff effects .",
    "given that they are dominated by the low - energy region , such effect would be encoded in the lowest - energy double virtual parameter @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , we can set it free and match to the experimental values . for the @xmath24",
    ", it requires a large negative @xmath54 value , greatly damping the tff at low energies .",
    "in contrast , for the @xmath25 case this requires an extremely softly - falling tff , which would require the use of the @xmath77 approximant .",
    "considering both results represents then a puzzling situation . using this input to calculate the @xmath116 contribution , we obtain without(with ) the latest rc results @xmath117 this represents a large shift with respect to our previous prediction in table  [ tab : g2res ] , much beyond our quoted error .",
    "we conclude therefore that such situation calls for an urgent revision .",
    "first , some experimental data would be required in order to improve our knowledge of the tff .",
    "second , a new precise measurement , with the latest results on radiative corrections accounted for , should be pursued .",
    "only this would clarify the current situation and conclude whether we have the situation under control or , perhaps , new physics are playing some role in these decays .",
    "we have presented a model - independent approach based on rational approximants , namely , canterbury approximants , to describe the pseudoscalar tffs .",
    "this method provides both an useful tool to extract valuable information about tff from experimental data as well as to reconstruct the tff itself for later calculations .",
    "we have used this model to calculate then the @xmath12 and @xmath13 hlbl contribution to @xmath4 .",
    "we have shown that the current limitation comes from our uncertainty on the double - virtual tff , for which no data is available yet .",
    "to supply this situation , we have made use of @xmath19 decays .",
    "we have found that current experimental values present a puzzling situation which challenge our tff description .",
    "nevertheless , experimental work is required before any claim , which is specially urgent given the projected accuracy of future @xmath4 experiments . meanwhile , to improve our description , we are studying the next @xmath118 approximant , which would allow to implement both , the low- and high - energy constraints at once and , we hope , will provide a better understading of the situation .",
