    "the derangement polynomial @xmath22 shares most of the main properties of @xmath23 .",

    "theorem [ thm : main ] implies that @xmath3 can be written as a sum of two polynomials with nonnegative , symmetric and unimodal coefficients , whose centers of symmetry differ by a half , and thus provides a new proof of its unimodality , as we now explain .",

    ".    we should point out that it is theorem [ thm : localint ] and the methods of @xcite which led the authors to suspect that formula ( [ eq : main ] ) holds .",
    "indeed , it follows from the relevant definitions and some more work ( see section [ sec : geom ] ) that the local @xmath4-polynomial of @xmath54 is equal to the right - hand side of ( [ eq : localint+ ] ) . by exploiting the symmetry of this polynomial and certain recurrence relations for that and for @xmath3 ( see section  [ sec : half ] ) , one can show that the local @xmath4-polynomial of @xmath54 is equal to @xmath34 , as defined by the decomposition ( [ eq : dnbsymsum ] ) .",
