    "in many applications , the input and output of the controller are quantized signals .",
    "this is due to the physical properties of the actuators / sensors and the data - rate limitation of links connected to the controller .",
    "quantized control for linear time - invariant systems actively studied from various point of view , as surveyed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the context of systems with discrete jumps such as switched systems and piecewise affine ( pwa ) systems , control problems with limited information have recently received increasing attention . for sampled - data switched systems , a stability analysis under finite - level static quantization has been developed in @xcite , and an encoding and control strategy for stabilization has been proposed in the state feedback case @xcite , whose related works have been presented for the output feedback case @xcite and for the case with bounded disturbances @xcite . also , our previous work @xcite has studied the stabilization of continuous - time switched systems with quantized output feedback , based on the results in @xcite . however ,",
    "relatively little work has been conducted on quantized control for pwa systems . in @xcite ,",
    "a sufficient condition for input - to - state stability has been obtained for time - delay pwa systems with quantization signals , but logarithmic quantizers in @xcite have an infinite number of quantization levels .    the main objective of this paper is to stabilize discrete - time pwa systems with quantized signals . in order to achieve the local asymptotic stabilization of discrete - time pwa plants with finite data rates , we extend the event - based encoding method in @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that we are given feedback controllers that stabilize the closed - loop system in the sense that there exists a piecewise quadratic lyapunov function . in the input quantization case",
    ", the controller receives the original state . on the other hand , in the state quantization case , the quantized state and the currently active mode of the plant are available to the controller .",
    "the information on the active mode prevents a mode mismatch between the plant and the controller , and moreover , allows the controller side to recompute a better quantization value if the quantized state transmitted from the quantizer is near the boundaries of quantization regions .",
    "this recomputation is motivated in section 7.2 in @xcite .",
    "we also investigate the design of quantized feedback controllers . to this end , we consider the stabilization problem of discrete - time pwa systems with bounded disturbances ( under no quantization ) . the lypunov - based stability analysis and stabilization of discrete - time pwa systems has been studied in @xcite and @xcite in terms of linear matrix inequalities ( lmis ) and bilinear matrix inequalities ( bmis ) . in proofs that lyapunov functions decrease along the trajectories of pwa systems , the one - step reachable set",
    ", that is , the set to which the state belong in one step , plays an important role . in stability analysis",
    ", the one - step reachable set can be obtained by linear programming . by contrast , in the stabilization case , since the next - step state depends on the control input , it is generally difficult to obtain the one - step reachable set .",
    "therefore many previous works for the design of stabilizing controllers assume that the one - step reachable set is the total state space .",
    "however , if disturbances are bounded , then this assumption leads to conservative results and high computational loads as the number of the plant mode increases .",
    "we aim to find the one - step reachable set for pwa systems with bounded disturbances . to this effect",
    ", we derive a sufficient condition on feedback controllers for the state to belong to a given polyhedron in one step .",
    "this condition can be used to add constraints on the state and the input as well .",
    "furthermore , we obtain a set containing the one - step reachable set by using the information of the input matrix @xmath0 and the input bound @xmath1 .",
    "this set is conservative because the affine feedback structure @xmath2 for mode @xmath3 is not considered , but it can be used when we design the polyhedra that are assumed to be given in the above sufficient condition . combining the proposed condition with results in @xcite for lyapunov functions to be positive and decrease along the trajectories , we can design stabilizing controllers for pwa systems with bounded disturbances .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section shows a class of quantizer and a basic assumption on stability . in sections iii and iv , we present an encoding strategy to achieve local stability for pwa systems in the input quantization case and the state quantization case , respectively . in section",
    "v , we study the one - step reachable set for the stabilization problem of pwa systems with bounded disturbances . finally , concluding remarks are given in section vi .    due to space constraints , all proofs and a numerical example have been omitted and can be found in * ? ? ?",
