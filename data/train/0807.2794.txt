    "research on top - quark physics at hadron colliders has received great interest in the past years in view of the steadily improving measurements at tevatron and the upcoming lhc ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) . in this respect ,",
    "the total cross section for top - quark pair production is a quantity of great importance for experimental analyses and even allows for measurements of the top - quark mass .",
    "moreover , on the theory side , the total cross section has been subject to numerous studies the motivation being improved predictions beyond the long - known next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections in qcd  @xcite .",
    "recent work in this direction has aimed at completing the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) qcd predictions  @xcite , at resumming large sudakov logarithms to next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy  @xcite and , at estimating bound state effects  @xcite . also our knowledge on the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and the precision of the top - quark mass determination has continuously improved over the last years .    in order to study the impact of the various improvements on tevatron and lhc predictions we build on the recent results of ref .",
    "these approximate nnlo results for the total cross section are based on the complete logarithmic dependence on the heavy quark velocity @xmath1 near threshold @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , they include the complete two - loop coulomb corrections as well as the exact dependence on the renormalization and factorization scale at nnlo  @xcite .",
    "recently , similar studies have appeared in refs .",
    "@xcite . while ref .",
    "@xcite largely follows our approach  @xcite to describe the total top - quark pair cross section at nnlo , ref .",
    "@xcite has limited itself to updating older predictions based on threshold resummation to next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy only .",
    "thus , ref .",
    "@xcite necessarily arrives at larger theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the interesting study of ref .",
    "@xcite on the other hand applied consistently predictions to nlo accuracy in qcd . in doing so ,",
    "it has investigated correlations of rates for top - quark pair production with many other cross sections at lhc to quantify a potential sensitivity to the gluon luminosity .",
    "the total hadronic cross section for top - quark pair production depends on the hadronic center - of - mass energy squared @xmath3 and the top - quark mass @xmath4 .",
    "it is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the pdfs of the proton .",
    "the partonic cross section is given by @xmath7 and @xmath8 denotes the standard convolution ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the generally adopted procedure to estimate the theoretical uncertainty for @xmath9 in eq .  ( [ eq : totalcrs ] ) exploits the residual dependence on the renormalization and factorization scale , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which are identified throughout this article ( i.e. @xmath12 ) .",
    "the nlo qcd corrections for the parton cross section @xmath7 and the pdfs @xmath6 provide the first instance where a meaningful error can be determined in this way .",
    "we define the range as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is computed from the variation of the cross section with respect to the parameters of the global fit ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this contribution",
    "we employ the approximate nnlo result  @xcite to predict cross sections  ( [ eq : totalcrs ] ) and the associated uncertainty ranges  ( [ eq : range ] ) at tevatron and lhc .",
    "let us therefore briefly comment on the anticipated accuracy .",
    "our cross section  takes along all logarithmically enhanced terms @xmath15 , @xmath16 as well as the complete coulomb corrections ( @xmath17 ) at two loops for the dominant parton channels @xmath18 and @xmath19 and adds them on top of the exact nlo predictions . in this way , our predictions rely on exact expressions in the region of phase space @xmath2 , where perturbative corrections receive the largest weight from the convolution with the parton luminosities , cf .",
    "( [ eq : totalcrs ] ) .",
    "the effect of new parton channels opening at nnlo ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) is expected to be small , cf .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 channels at nlo .",
    "the region of large energies @xmath24 on the other hand is inaccessible within our approach  @xcite .",
    "however , it is expected to give only small contributions in a full nnlo calculation in line with the observed small corrections for top - quark pair production together with an additional jet at nlo  @xcite which are part of the full nnlo correction for top - quark pair production .",
    "moreover , we have also included the exact @xmath10 and @xmath11 scale dependence at nnlo  @xcite which can be constructed using renormalization group methods .",
    "for the time being , we have chosen a common value @xmath25 for the scales , and we will address the independent variation of @xmath10 and @xmath11 in a future publication .",
    "however , based on preliminary studies we do not expect large modifications here . in summary",
    ", we have accounted for all numerically dominant contributions and are confident that this provides a very good approximation to the unknown full nnlo result as experience from other reactions , e.g. higgs - production in gluon fusion  @xcite shows .",
    "let us next present our results for tevatron and lhc .",
    "in figs .  [",
    "fig : tev ] and [ fig : lhc ] we plot the uncertainty range  ( [ eq : range ] ) comparing nlo and nnlo accuracy .     the  and  qcd prediction for the @xmath26 total cross section at tevatron for @xmath27  tev .",
    "the bands denote the total uncertainty from pdf and scale variations for the mrst06nnlo set  @xcite according to eq .",

    "the residual scale dependence of  is 3% , which corresponds to a reduction by a factor of two compared to nlo . the overall uncertainty according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : range ] ) is at  about 8% for the cteq6.6 and 6% for the mrst06nnlo pdf set . at lhc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc ] ) our  leads only to a small shift of a few percent in the central value and the  band is about 6% for cteq6.6 and about 4% for mrst06nnlo , which exhibits again a drastic reduction of the scale uncertainty as compared to the prediction based on nlo qcd .    for phenomenological applications , the results of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : totalcrs ] ) , ( [ eq : range ] ) are best presented by means of simple formulae for the mass dependence of the total cross section . to that end",
    "we make the ansatz following ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "the parameters @xmath31 are fitted to reproduce @xmath9 in the mass range @xmath32 with a typical accuracy of better than @xmath33 per mille . for tevatron and lhc the respective results for various pdf sets",
    "are given in tabs .",
    "[ tab : mass - fit - tev][tab : mass - fit - lhc ] .",
    "note , that eq.([eq : mass - dep ] ) uses a polynomial of degree four and also determines the parameter @xmath34 for the central value @xmath35 from the fit .",

    "such particles with a mass @xmath40 appear in certain extensions of the standard model and we focus on a production model which is entirely dominated by qcd effects . thus , our cross section @xmath41 provides a meaningful and accurate prediction because its numerical values arises largely from the threshold region where the logarithms @xmath42 dominate .    in tabs .",
    "[ tab : new - hvq - mrst06 ] , [ tab : new - hvq - cteq65 ] we quote the corresponding numbers in the mass range @xmath43 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for results to nlo accuracy ) .",
    "we observe that the scale dependence at nnlo accuracy is rather small , showing the expected good stability of the perturbative prediction .",
    "the relative variation of @xmath9 with respect to the pdfs , though , is dominating by far .",
    "note there is the usual factor of two between the pdf uncertainty quoted by mrst06nnlo  @xcite and the cteq6.5  @xcite pdf sets due to the definition of the tolerance criteria in the respective fits .",
    "the reason for the large observed pdf uncertainty is the gluon pdf being poorly constrained in the relevant region of large momentum fraction @xmath44 .",
    "this is a fact well - known to influence many searches for high - mass particles in gluon fusion channels ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for the correlation of top - quark pair production rate with the high mass higgs cross section ) .    [ cols=\"^,<,<,^,<,<,^,<,<,^ \" , ]",
    "we have presented updated predictions for cross sections of top - quark pair production based on the ( approximate ) nnlo results of ref .",
    "these represent the best present estimates for hadro - production of top - quark pairs , both at tevatron and lhc .",
    "we have argued that the neglected contributions ( i.e. power suppressed terms away from threshold and new parton channels ) are numerically small .",
    "we have found good convergence properties of the higher order corrections and greatly improved stability of the total cross section with respect to scale variations by our  result . for applications , we have presented simple formulae  ( [ eq : mass - dep ] ) with 0.1 per mille accuracy for the mass dependence of the total cross section in the range @xmath32 .",
