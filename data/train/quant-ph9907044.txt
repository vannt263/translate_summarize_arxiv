    "recently there has been rapid progress in techniques for trapping samples of neutral atoms at elevated densities and extremely low temperatures .",
    "the development of magnetic and optical traps for atoms has proceeded in parallel in recent years , in order to attain higher densities and lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "we should note here that traps for neutral particles have been around much longer than their realizations for neutral atoms might suggest , and the seminal papers for neutral particles trapping as applied to neutrons and plasmas date from the sixties and seventies .",
    "many of these papers are referenced by the authors of refs.@xcite . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the study of _ magnetic _ traps .",
    "such traps exploit the interaction of the magnetic moment of the atom with the inhomogeneous magnetic field to provide spatial confinement .",
    "microscopic particles are not the only candidates for magnetic traps . in fact",
    ", a vivid demonstration of trapping large scale objects is the hovering magnetic top @xcite .",
    "this ingenious magnetic device , which hovers in mid - air for about 2 minutes , has been studied in the past few years by several authors @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism underlying the operation of magnetic traps is the adiabatic principle .",
    "the common way to describe their operation is in terms of _ classical _ mechanics : as the particle is released into the trap , its magnetic moment points antiparallel to the direction of the magnetic field . inside the trap , the particle experiences translation oscillations with vibrational frequencies @xmath13 which are small compared to its precession frequency @xmath14 . under this condition",
    "the spin of the particle may be considered as experiencing a _ slowly _ rotating magnetic field .",
    "thus , the spin precesses around the _ local _ direction of the magnetic field @xmath15 ( adiabatic approximation ) and , on the average , its magnetic moment @xmath16 points _ antiparallel _ to the local magnetic field lines .",
    "hence , the magnetic energy , which is normally given by @xmath17 , is now given ( for small precession angle ) by @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the overall effective potential seen by the particle is @xmath19 in the adiabatic approximation , the spin degree of freedom is rigidly coupled to the translational degrees of freedom , and is already incorporated in eq.([energy ] ) such that the particle may be considered as having only translational degrees of freedom . when the strength of the magnetic field possesses a _ _  minimum _ _ , the effective potential becomes attractive near that minimum , and the whole apparatus acts as a trap .",
    "as mentioned above , the adiabatic approximation holds whenever @xmath20 . as @xmath14 is inversely proportional to the spin",
    ", this inequality can be satisfied provided that the spin of the particle is sufficiently small .",
    "if , on the other hand , the spin of the particle is too large , it can not respond fast enough to the changes of the direction of the magnetic field . in this limit @xmath21",
    ", the spin has to be considered as fixed in space and , according to earnshaw s theorem @xcite , becomes unstable against _ translations_. note also that @xmath14 is proportional to the field @xmath22 . to prevent @xmath14 of becoming too small , resulting in spin - flips ( majorana transitions ) ,",
    "most magnetostatic traps include a _ bias _ field , so that the effective potential @xmath23 possesses a _ nonvanishing _ minimum .",
    "the discussion of magnetic traps in the literature is , almost entirely , done in terms of _ classical _ mechanics . in microscopic systems , however , quantum effects become important , giving rise to a finite lifetime of the particle within the trap .",
    "this requires a quantum - mechanical treatment @xcite .",
    "an even more interesting issue is the understanding of how the classical and the quantum descriptions of a _ given _ system are related .",
    "it is important to note here that there are _ two _ mechanisms by which the particle can escape from the trap : the first one is the usual tunneling of the particle from the trap , without a change of its spin state , to regions where the magnetic field decreases to zero .",
    "the time scale for this process can be evaluated by standard methods .",
    "the second way the particle can escape from the trap is by flipping its spin state ( majorana transitions ) .",
    "this process , which is different from the first one because there is no potential barrier , is the subject of this paper .    as a first step in our efforts to understand the quantum - mechanics of magnetic traps",
    ", we recently developed a method for calculating the _ lifetime _ of a particle inside a magnetic trap with respect to such a spin flip process @xcite .",
    "the toy model that was used in this study consisted of a particle with spin , having only a single translational degree of freedom , in the presence of a 1d inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "we found that the trapped state of the particle decays with a lifetime given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and where the result is valid for @xmath26 .",
    "though the field that was used in this model did trap the particle , it was not _",
    "realistic _ in the sense that it was not curl - free .",
    "our next step was to study the case of a particle with spin , having _ two _ translational degree of freedom , in the presence of a physically more realistic trapping field that , in contradistinction to the toy model , _ is _ curl - free  @xcite .",
    "this model is reminiscent of a ioffe - pritchard trap @xcite , but without the axial translational degree of freedom .",
    "here we found that the lifetime is given by @xmath27 which is similar to the result found in the 1d case . in the present paper",
    "we describe an analysis of a ioffe - pritchard type trap which _ includes _ the axial translational degree of freedom .",
    "we neglect the effect of interactions between the particles in the trap , and we analyze the dynamics of a _ single _ particle inside the trap . unlike in our previous papers , where we studied the case of a spin @xmath28 particle ,",
    "we treat here the case of a spin @xmath29 particle , both as an example to show the validity of our approach for higher spins , and also because it is more relevant in view of the recent development in bose - einstein condensation experiments .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in sec.([def ] ) we start by defining the system we study , together with useful parameters that will be used throughout this paper .",
    "next , we carry out a _ classical _ analysis of the problem in sec.([class ] ) . here , we find two stationary solutions for the particle inside the trap .",
    "one of them corresponds to a state whose spin is _ parallel _ to the direction of the magnetic field whereas the other one corresponds to a state whose spin is _ antiparallel _ to that direction .",
    "when considering the dynamical stability of these solutions , we find that only the _ antiparallel _ stationary solution is stable , as expected from the discussion in sec.([desc ] ) above . in sec.([quant ] ) we reconsider the problem from a _ quantum - mechanical _ point of view for a spin-_one _ particle . here",
    ", we find states that refer to _ antiparallel _",
    "( @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the magnetic quantum number ) and _ orthogonal _ ( @xmath32 ) orientations of the spin , the first of these being bounded while the second one is unbounded .",
    "we argue that the third possible situation , in which the spin is _ parallel _ ( @xmath33 ) to the direction of the field , has negligible coupling to the bound state , and therefore can be neglected .",
    "we show that the _ antiparallel _ and _ orthogonal _ states are _ coupled _ due to the inhomogeneity of the field , and we calculate the transition rate from the bound state to the unbounded state . finally , in sec.([dis ] )",
    "we compare the results of the classical analysis with those of the quantum analysis and comment on their implications for practical magnetic traps .",
    "we consider a particle of mass @xmath1 , magnetic moment @xmath2 and intrinsic spin @xmath0 ( aligned with @xmath2 ) moving in an inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath15 corresponding to traps of the ioffe - pritchard , ` clover - leaf ' and ` baseball ' type @xcite , and given by @xmath34   \\mathbf{\\hat{z}% } \\label{d0}\\\\ &   + \\left (   b^{\\prime}-\\dfrac{1}{2}b^{\\prime\\prime}z\\right )   x\\mathbf{\\hat { x}+}\\left (   -b^{\\prime}-\\dfrac{1}{2}b^{\\prime\\prime}z\\right )   y\\mathbf{\\hat { y}}\\text{.}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this field possesses a nonzero minimum of amplitude at the origin , which is the essential part of the trap .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system is@xmath35 where @xmath36 is the momentum of the particle .",
    "we define @xmath3 as the precessional frequency of the particle when it is at the origin @xmath37 .",
    "since at that point the magnetic field is @xmath38 we find that @xmath39 next , we define @xmath4 and @xmath5 as the small - amplitude axial and lateral vibrational frequencies of the particle when it is placed with _",

    "it is clear that as @xmath44 and @xmath45 become smaller and smaller , the adiabatic approximation becomes more and more accurate .",
    "note that when the bias field @xmath46 vanishes , both @xmath44 and @xmath45 become infinite , and the adiabatic approximation fails .",
    "we will show below that , under this condition , the system becomes _ unstable _ against spin flips , which is in agreement with our discussion at the beginning .",
    "this shows that the introduction of the bias field @xmath46 , is _ essential _ to the operation of the trap with regard to spin - flips .",
    "we denote by @xmath47 a unit vector in the direction of the spin ( and the magnetic moment ) .",
    "thus , the equations of motion for the center of mass of the particle are @xmath48 and the evolution of its spin is determined by @xmath49 the two equilibrium solutions to eqs.([c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) are @xmath50 with@xmath51 representing a motionless particle at the origin with its magnetic moment ( and spin ) pointing _ antiparallel _ ( @xmath52 ) to the direction of the field at that point and a similar solution but with the magnetic moment pointing _ parallel _ to the direction of the field ( @xmath53 ) .      to check the stability of these solutions we now add first - order perturbations .",
    "we set @xmath54 ( note that , to first order , the perturbation @xmath55 is _ orthogonal _ to the vector @xmath47 for the stationary solution @xmath56 , since @xmath47 is a unit vector ) , substitute these into eqs.([c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) , and retain only first - order terms . we find that the resulting equations for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are @xmath62 the motion of the @xmath63-coordinate is decoupled from the others . if @xmath64 , it is stable only when the upper sign is taken , corresponding to a spin _ antiparallel _ to the direction of the field .",
    "it can be shown that when @xmath65 then , even if the system is stable under axial vibrations ( by choosing the lower sign ) , it can not be stable as a whole .",
    "we therefore disregard the lower sign , and the equation for the @xmath63-coordinate for the rest of the derivation .",
    "the normal modes of the reduced system transform as the irreducible representations of the symmetry group . the 4-dimensional linear space spanned by the deviations @xmath66 from the stationary state carries the irreducible representations @xmath67 with characters @xmath68 and @xmath69 with characters @xmath70 , and",
    "may thus be decomposed into the two 2-dimensional invariant subspaces transforming as @xmath67 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "these subspaces are spanned by the circular position coordinates and precessional spin coordinates@xmath71 thus , the normal modes consist of a circular motion in the @xmath72-plane coupled to a precession of the spin vector in the _ opposite _ sense .",
    "indeed , after introducing the @xmath73-coordinates into eqs.([c5 ] ) , this set of four equations decomposes into one pair of equations for @xmath74 and another pair for @xmath75 .",
    "we now look for oscillatory ( stable ) solutions of these equations and set @xmath76 this yields the algebraic equations @xmath77{cc}%",

    "this yields the secular equations @xmath80 which determine the eigenfrequencies @xmath81 of the various modes . since the reduced system has three degrees of freedom , we expect to have three normal modes . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath81 is a solution of the first equation , then @xmath82 is a solution of the second equation .",
    "we define the mode frequencies in eq.([c11.1 ] ) to be positive ( or , in the case of complex @xmath81 , to have positive real part ) ; the negative @xmath81-values are needed to construct real solutions .",
    "then , the @xmath67-modes describe vibrational motions turning counter - clockwise coupled to spin precessions turning clockwise , i.e. , opposite to the natural spin precession , and the @xmath69-modes describe vibrational motions turning clockwise coupled to spin precessions turning counter - clockwise , i.e. , in the same sense as the natural spin precession .",
    "stability requires that all three solutions of , say , eq.([c11.2 ] ) be _",
    "real_. we note that at the edge of the stability region ( and when @xmath83 ) , two out of the three roots of eq.([c11.2 ] ) for @xmath81 become identical . in this case , the third order polynomial eq.([c11.2 ] ) takes the form @xmath84 @xmath85 , which satisfy @xmath86 .",
    "the edge of the stability region is then found by simultaneously solving the equations @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",

    "the longest time scale ( provided that @xmath45 and @xmath44 are small ) @xmath238 , which is not present in the classical problem , is the time it takes for the particle to escape from the trap .    whereas the classical analysis yields an upper bound for @xmath44 and @xmath45 for trapping to occur , no such sharp bound exists in the quantum - mechanical analysis .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to compare the classical bound with the values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 for which the exponent in the expression for the quantum - mechanical lifetime becomes equal to @xmath29 : according to fig.([fig1 ] ) , we find that @xmath239 when @xmath240 , and @xmath241 when @xmath242 . from eq.([final ] ) on the other hand",

    "the results , being correct to within an order of magnitude , are outlined in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we note that in both cases the values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 are much smaller than @xmath29 . also , the calculated lifetime of the particle in the trap is extremely large , suggesting that the particle is tightly trapped in this field .    in this study",

    "our preliminary results show that some of these excited states may have a _ short _ lifetime , being _ algebraically _ dependent on @xmath248 and @xmath249 rather than _ exponentially _ dependent .",
