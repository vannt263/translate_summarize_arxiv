    "living matter composed of active particles , which convert internal energy into systematic translational motion , is a particular class of materials typically far from equilibrium .",
    "examples range from the microscopic scale of bacterial suspensions@xcite to the macroscopic scale of flocks of birds and mammalian herds.@xcite such active systems exhibit remarkable nonequilibrium phenomena and emergent behavior like swarming , @xcite turbulence , @xcite activity - induced clustering and phase transitions , @xcite and a shift of the glass - transition temperature .",
    "@xcite the nonequilibrium character of active matter poses particular challenges for a theoretical description . in particular , a thermodynamic description is missing , but would be desirable in order to be able to define elementary thermodynamic variables such as temperature or chemical potential . @xcite",
    "considerable progress in the description of activity - induced phase transitions has been achieved recently .",
    "@xcite    pressure in active fluids attracted considerable attention lately , because a mechanical pressure as force per area can be defined far from equilibrium and might be useful in the strive to derive a nonequilibrium equation of state.@xcite interestingly , simulation studies reveal such an equation of state , with a van der waals - type pressure - volume phase diagram typical for gas - liquid coexistence .",
    "@xcite    in thermal equilibrium , pressure can equivalently be defined in various ways .",
    "in addition to the mechanical definition , pressure @xmath0 follows as derivative with respect to the volume @xmath1 of the helmholtz free energy @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath3 , at constant temperature @xmath4 and particle number @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite moreover , the virial theorem can be exploited .",
    "@xcite these two identical formulations relate the surface pressure to bulk properties .",
    "however , for nonequilibrium systems , it is _ a prior _ not evident how to relate the surface pressure to bulk properties , as it has to be kept in mind that there is usually no free - energy functional . by now , pressure in active fluids has been calculated using various virial - type expressions , @xcite typically without a fundamental derivation .",
    "basic relations are provided for two - dimensional fluids in ref .  , starting from the mechanical definition of pressure and by exploiting the fokker - planck equation for the phase - space probability distribution .    here",
    ", we apply the virial theorem to derive expressions for the pressure in active fluids .",
    "both , fluids confined between solid walls and exposed to periodic boundary conditions are considered . as an important first step ,",
    "we demonstrate that the mechanical pressure of a confined fluid can equivalently be represented by the virial of the surface forces for particular geometries such as a cuboid and a sphere .",
    "this has important implications , since it provides a relation of the mechanical pressure with bulk properties of the fluid .",
    "@xcite based on this expression , we derive an internal expression for the pressure , which comprises the ideal gas pressure , an swim pressure due to particle propulsion , and a contribution by the interparticle interactions . as a result",
    ", we find that the swim pressure of the spherical abps explicitly depends on the presence of confining walls and the particle - wall interaction , in contrast to results presented in ref .  , but in agreement with more general considerations of anisotropic bodies .",
    "@xcite systems with periodic boundary conditions naturally lack such a term .",
    "hence , walls can induce features in confined active systems , which will not appear in periodic systems .    by brownian dynamics simulations ,",
    "we determine pressure - concentration relations for various pclet numbers of three - dimensional periodic systems of active brownian particles . as already previously observed , @xcite we find an increasingly nonmonotonic behavior of the pressure with increasing propulsion velocity . above a certain velocity",
    ", we also find a van der waals - loop - type relation .",
    "most importantly , however , we find an abrupt change of the pressure for phase - separating fluids .",
    "thereby , the magnitude of the pressure jump increases with increasing propulsion velocity .",
    "hence , we argue that the nonmonotonic behavior indicates increased density fluctuations of the active fluid , but a phase transition is reflected in a more pronounced abrupt change of the pressure .",
    "a detailed analysis of the individual contributions to the pressure shows that the main effect is due to the activity of the colloidal particles , which gives rise to a so - called  swim pressure  as introduced in ref .  .",
