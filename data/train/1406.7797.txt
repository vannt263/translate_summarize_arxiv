    "consider the following initial - boundary value problem for the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation on the positive half - line @xmath0 with given initial data : @xmath1 and with a given ( generally nonhomogeneous ) dirichlet boundary condition at @xmath2 : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is an arbitrary parameter . assuming that @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and that the compatibility condition @xmath7 holds , carroll and bu @xcite have established the existence of a unique classical global solution of this problem that is a continuously differentiable map from @xmath8 to @xmath9 and that is a continuous map from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation is an integrable equation , being the compatibility condition for the existence of a simultaneous general solution @xmath12 of the equation @xmath13 and also of the equation @xmath14 here @xmath15 is a complex spectral parameter , and the compatibility condition is independent of @xmath15 .",
    "these two linear equations for @xmath12 comprise the _ lax pair _ for .",
    "one of the earliest applications of the lax pair representation of integrable equations was the development of a transform technique based on the spectral theory of the spatial equation of the lax pair , the _ inverse - scattering transform _ , for solving initial - value problems posed for @xmath16 with initial data given at @xmath17 ; see @xcite for a pedagogical description .",
    "more recently , a _ unified transform method _ has been developed involving the simultaneous use of both equations of the lax pair to study mixed initial - boundary value problems of various types . as a general reference for these methods that includes the specific details we will need in this paper , we refer to @xcite ;",
    "there is also a website @xcite that summarizes the salient features of the technique and has links to many original references .    for the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation on the half - line @xmath18 , the unified transform method first advanced in @xcite and also described in @xcite amounts to the following algorithm .",
    "recall the pauli spin matrices @xmath19 and let @xmath20 .",
    "firstly , define the following special solutions of the lax pair : @xmath21 and @xmath22 the spectral transforms of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are then given by @xmath26 and by elementary symmetries one also has that @xmath27 the second column of @xmath28 is analytic and bounded in @xmath15 for @xmath29 whenever @xmath30 ( and hence the same is true of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) . the second column of @xmath33 is analytic and bounded in @xmath15 for @xmath34 whenever @xmath35 ( and hence the same is true of @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) .    next , given these functions of @xmath15 , one formulates a riemann - hilbert problem .",
    "let @xmath38 denote the contour @xmath39 with each of the four half - line arcs of @xmath40 assigned an orientation such that the domain @xmath34 lies on the left . on each of the four arcs we define a _ jump matrix",
    "as follows : @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 here , the spectral coefficients in the jump matrix are @xmath45 and all of the dependence on @xmath46 and @xmath47 appears explicitly through the function @xmath48 the riemann - hilbert problem is then the following .",
    "find a @xmath49 matrix @xmath50 with the following properties :    * * analyticity : * @xmath51 is analytic and uniformly bounded for @xmath52 , taking boundary values @xmath53 on each of the four rays of @xmath38 from the domain where @xmath54 . * * jump condition : * the boundary values are related on each ray of @xmath38 by the jump condition @xmath55 where @xmath56 is defined by . * * normalization : * @xmath57 as @xmath58 .",
    "[ rhp - original ]    from the solution of riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp - original ] , which depends parametrically on @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath59 , one obtains a solution of the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation by taking the limit @xmath60    this procedure is derived assuming the existence of a solution @xmath61 satisfying the initial and boundary conditions in addition to some other technical assumptions .",
    "it produces the solution to the initial - boundary value problem under two conditions :    * the given boundary data @xmath62 used to compute the spectral transforms from  are consistent .",
    "that is , @xmath63 must agree with ( @xmath59 times ) the neumann boundary value of the solution of the dirichlet problem whose well - posedness was established by carroll and bu @xcite .",
    "* the function @xmath64 must have no zeros in the closed second quadrant of the complex @xmath15-plane .",
    "this is a technical condition as otherwise riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp - original ] must be formulated differently to allow @xmath50 to have poles at these points and their complex conjugates , with prescribed residue relations .",
    "it is conjectured that in fact @xmath64 is nonvanishing for consistent boundary data , but to our knowledge there is no proof of this in the literature .",
    "of course the problem is that if the boundary data functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are both independently specified as is required to calculate the spectral transforms and hence the jump matrices , then the initial - boundary value problem is overdetermined and the solution of the equation produced by the method can not generally satisfy the initial and boundary conditions ( although it will solve the differential equation in the interior of the domain ) .",
    "on the other hand , the procedure is sadly incomplete if only the dirichlet data ( the function @xmath24 ) is specified in which case the jump matrices  are indeterminate as @xmath65 can not be calculated at all from  and .    a central role in the unified transform theory",
    "is therefore played by the _ global relation _ , an identity satisfied by the spectral transforms of consistent boundary data @xmath62 that encodes in the transform domain the dirichlet - to - neumann map giving @xmath66 in terms of @xmath67 and @xmath68 . under certain conditions on the dirichlet data ,",
    "the global relation can be effectively solved , and hence the unknown neumann data is eliminated .",
    "the class of boundary conditions for which the global relation can be solved by symmetries in the complex @xmath15-plane is called the class of _ linearizable _ boundary conditions .",
    "unfortunately , the only type of dirichlet boundary condition known to be linearizable is the homogeneous boundary condition @xmath69 .",
    "of course , this special case can also be handled via the usual inverse scattering transform on the whole line @xmath16 simply by extending the initial data @xmath70 to @xmath71 as an odd function .",
    "another approach to general nonhomogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions that avoids the global relation entirely may be based on the observation that under mild conditions , given the spectral transforms @xmath72 , riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp - original ] has a unique solution for almost all @xmath73 by analytic fredholm theory ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.3 ) ) combined with steepest descent asymptotics for large @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the exceptional set is the zero locus of an entire scalar function of @xmath74 that does not vanish identically , i.e. , a complex curve in @xmath75 that may or may not have real points but that would be at worst a closed and nowhere - dense union of analytic arcs in the real @xmath76-plane .",
    "this in turn implies ( by the standard arguments of the _ dressing method _ , see also the proof of proposition  [ prop : solution - exists ] below ) that for those @xmath76 for which a solution exists the function @xmath61 produced by taking the limit is necessarily _ some _ solution of the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the question is whether this solution satisfies also the ( three in total ) initial and boundary conditions that were used to generate the spectral transforms @xmath72 in the first place .",
    "this line of reasoning suggests an iteration procedure for solving the dirichlet initial - boundary value problem for the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation on the half - line with general nonhomogeneous data : begin by making an initial guess for the ( unknown ) neumann boundary data , say @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "set @xmath79 and then :    1 .",
    "take @xmath80 , and with the given dirichlet data @xmath81 and @xmath70 calculate the spectral transforms @xmath82 from . 2 .",
    "formulate riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp - original ] with these spectral transforms and solve it .",
    "denote the function obtained from as @xmath83 .",
    "it is necessarily a solution of the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation on the quarter plane @xmath18 and @xmath78 .",
    "3 .   define @xmath84 for @xmath78 .",
    "4 .   set @xmath85 and go to step 1 .    no doubt the reader can imagine various other iterative approaches like this one .",
    "it is not the purpose of this paper to study the convergence of this algorithm , but in the spirit of the principle that finite truncations of a convergent iteration ( or infinite series ) can often provide accuracy in various asymptotic limits , we wish to explore the possibility of using _",
    "just one iteration _ of the algorithm ( actually a slightly modified version of the first iteration , see  [ sec : formulation ] for details ) to provide an asymptotic approximation of the solution of the dirichlet initial - boundary value problem in the _ semiclassical limit _",
    "the key to the success of this procedure is to make a very good initial guess for the unknown neumann data , one that is asymptotically accurate in the semiclassical limit ( as we will rigorously prove after the fact , see theorem  [ theorem : boundary - condition - recover ] ) .",
    "that is , what we need is an explicit approximation of the dirichlet - to - neumann map for .",
    "let us now explain the approximation of the dirichlet - to - neumann map for the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation that we plan to study in this article .",
    "without loss of generality , we represent the complex field @xmath61 in real phase - amplitude form : @xmath87 substituting into , dividing by the common factor @xmath88 , and separating real and imaginary parts yields the following system of equations : @xmath89 this coupled system is equivalent to .",
    "it is useful to intoduce notation for the phase gradient : @xmath90 now , in terms of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the exact ratio between the unknown neumann data and the given dirichlet data at @xmath2 takes the form @xmath93 consider the second equation of the system at @xmath2 along with in the formal semiclassical limit @xmath94 , assuming that @xmath95 .",
    "this means that we simply neglect the terms explicitly proportional to @xmath59 or @xmath96 in each case , yielding the formal approximations : @xmath97 our approach is to assume that the known dirichlet boundary data is specified in the form @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 are given real - valued functions independent of @xmath59 .",
    "obviously we then have @xmath101 and @xmath102 , so we may rewrite the approximate relations as @xmath103 assuming further that @xmath104 we solve the first of these relations for the unknown phase derivative @xmath105 at the boundary : @xmath106 that is , @xmath107 is the ( real valued ) formal semiclassical approximation of the exact phase derivative @xmath105 . finally , for dirichlet boundary data satisfying the condition we use the second equation of to approximate the dirichlet - to - neumann map as follows .",
    "suppose that the dirichlet boundary data @xmath81 of the form satisfies @xmath108 .",
    "the _ semiclassical approximation of the dirichlet - to - neumann map _ is defined by @xmath109 where @xmath107 is given in terms of the phase and amplitude of the known dirichlet data by .",
    "[ definition : d - to - n ]    the key point of our approach is that by neglecting the formally small dispersive terms in we obtain a system that is first - order in @xmath46 and hence allows the unknown neumann data to be _ explicitly eliminated _ in favor of @xmath47-derivatives that may be computed along the boundary from the given dirichlet data .",
    "this approximation is a purely local relation between the two boundary values , and in particular the approximate dirichlet - to - neumann map is independent of initial data @xmath23 .",
    "we have selected the positive square root in for a specific reason , which we now explain .",
    "differentiation of the second equation of with respect to @xmath46 produces the equivalent system @xmath110 obviously , is a formally small perturbation of a quasilinear system obtained by simply setting @xmath111 to zero .",
    "characteristic velocities _ of the limiting system are the eigenvalues @xmath112 of the coefficient matrix @xmath113 : @xmath114 as the characteristic velocities are real and distinct ( for @xmath115 ) , the limiting quasilinear system is of hyperbolic type .",
    "causality and local well - posedness for the cauchy problem of the hyperbolic approximating system in the quarter plane @xmath18 and @xmath78 requires that the boundary @xmath2 be a space - like curve .",
    "in other words , we require _ both _ characteristic velocities to be strictly positive at the boundary .",
    "this means that we will require that @xmath116 for all @xmath78 . since @xmath117 for @xmath78 it is clear that well - posedness of the limiting hyperbolic boundary - value problem requires in particular @xmath118 .",
    "in fact , we will ensure the condition @xmath116 by imposing the stronger condition @xmath119 ; the latter condition appears to be necessary to recover the dirichlet boundary data at @xmath2 for all @xmath78 ( see remark  [ remark : kb - negative ] below ) .      for convenience",
    "we restrict our attention to the already nontrivial and physically interesting case of zero initial data : @xmath120 for all @xmath18 .",
    "however , we fix rather general nonhomogeneous dirichlet boundary data of the form for @xmath78 ( and satisfying several additional conditions allowing our procedure to succeed , see assumption  [ assumption : data ] below ) , and attempt to solve the corresponding initial - boundary value problem .",
    "the first step is the calculation of the spectral transforms @xmath121 and @xmath122 corresponding to the dirichlet data @xmath81 given by and the formally approximate neumann data @xmath77 given by definition  [ definition : d - to - n ] .",
    "the direct spectral analysis is made possible in practice because the parameter @xmath123 is presumed small , so the equations of the lax pair become singularly perturbed differential equations that may be studied by classical methods .",
    "the results of this analysis are summarized in  [ sec : spectral - analysis ] , with the corresponding proofs appearing in two appendices . despite the rigor of these results ,",
    "there are certain difficulties that remain with directly formulating the inverse problem for the exact scattering data , so rather than calculate the solution of the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation corresponding to the exact spectral transforms of the ( generally incompatible ) dirichlet - neumann pair @xmath124 we modify the spectral functions in an ad - hoc fashion , but one inspired by the rigorous direct spectral analysis of the temporal problem of the lax pair .",
    "this allows us to formulate a simpler and completely explicit version of riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp - original ] for a matrix @xmath125 ; see  [ sec : formulation ] .",
    "the simpler riemann - hilbert problem explicitly encodes the given dirichlet boundary data through two integral transforms denoted @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( these are really the semiclassical analogues of the amplitude and phase of the spectral function @xmath128 ; see  ) , and its solution produces , for each @xmath123 , a solution @xmath129 of the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the rest of the paper is concerned with analyzing this solution , paying particular attention to the semiclassical asymptotic behavior of @xmath130 at the initial time @xmath17 for @xmath18 and at the boundary @xmath2 for @xmath78 .",
    "our first result is the following .",
    "the solution @xmath129 of the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation obtained from riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp - m - tilde ] satisfies @xmath131 where the error term is uniform on @xmath132 for each @xmath133 .",
    "[ theorem : initial - condition - small ]    thus the function @xmath130 nearly satisfies the given homogeneous initial condition @xmath134 for @xmath18 .",
    "our rigorous proof of this result is based on the steepest descent method for riemann - hilbert problems , combined with a natural generalization of the method involving @xmath135-problems @xcite . after establishing some preliminary results in  [ sec : preliminary - results ] ,",
    "we give the proof of theorem  [ theorem : initial - condition - small ] in  [ sec : initial - condition - small - proof ] .",
    "our next main result is the following .",
    "the points @xmath136 and @xmath137 are defined as part of assumption  [ assumption : data ] below .",
    "suppose that @xmath78 and @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",
    "the solution @xmath129 of the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation obtained from riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp - m - tilde ] satisfies @xmath140 and @xmath141 where the error terms are uniform for @xmath47 in compact subintervals of @xmath142 .",
    "[ theorem : boundary - condition - recover ]    equation shows that the same solution @xmath130 very nearly satisfies the given nonhomogeneous dirichlet boundary condition at @xmath2 for @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , from we see directly that the true neumann data at the boundary is indeed asymptotically consistent with the formal approximation given by definition  [ definition : d - to - n ] .",
    "the proof of this result is again based on the steepest descent method , this time augmented with the use of a complex phase function @xmath143 . after describing the general methodology and constructing the function @xmath143 in  [ sec : g - function ] , we present the proof of theorem  [ theorem : boundary - condition - recover ] in  [ sec : boundary - condition - recover - proof ] .",
    "the main point , however , is that the solution @xmath130 is represented also for @xmath76 not on the boundary of the quarter plane @xmath18 , @xmath78 via exactly the same riemann - hilbert problem ( see riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp - m - tilde ] ) .",
    "this means that one may use steepest descent methods to calculate @xmath130 for small @xmath123 for positive @xmath47 and away from the boundary . for @xmath76 close to the boundary of the quarter plane",

    "a concrete calculation of the vacuum domain for a particular choice of dirichlet boundary data is shown in figure  [ fig : vacuumdomain ] .",
    "( solid black curve ) and the @xmath59-independent vacuum domain ( shaded ) calculated from @xmath127 corresponding to the explicit boundary data illustrated in figure  [ fig : assumption1 ] below . also shown ( dashed curves )",

    "these asymptotes are described in  [ sec : vacuum - domain ] ( see and ) . ]",
    "another result is the following , which is essentially a corollary of the proof of theorem  [ theorem : boundary - condition - recover ] . here",
    "@xmath160 and @xmath161 are defined in terms of the dirichlet data by .",
    "each point @xmath162 with @xmath163 has a neighborhood @xmath164 in the @xmath76-plane in which there exist unique differentiable functions @xmath165 and @xmath166 satisfying @xmath167 and @xmath168 and the partial differential equations @xmath169 and such that the solution @xmath129 of the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation obtained from riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp - m - tilde ] satisfies @xmath170 uniformly for @xmath171 as @xmath151 , where @xmath172 and @xmath173 .

    "therefore , we observe that for small positive @xmath46 , @xmath130 resembles a modulated plane wave of the form for amplitude @xmath91 and phase @xmath177 independent of @xmath59 , and the modulation is described by the dispersionless nonlinear schrdinger system , or equivalently the whitham ( riemann - invariant form ) system .",
    "this shows consistency with , and adds yet more weight to , our approximate formula for the dirichlet - to - neumann map given in definition  [ definition : d - to - n ] .",

    "it is to be expected that these two domains do not exhaust the quarter plane .",

    "a key observation that was made fairly early in the development of the theory was that regardless of whether the spectral functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 actually correspond to a compatible dirichlet - neumann pair @xmath62 , riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp - original ] yields to asymptotic analysis in the limit of large @xmath47 ( with @xmath178 for some nonnegative velocity @xmath179 ) by the steepest descent method .",
    "general asymptotic properties of the solution that can be observed by such analysis therefore necessarily also describe the physical solutions of the dirichlet problem that simply correspond to the special case that the spectral functions satisfy the global relation . as a representative of this type of analysis ( for the focusing case of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ) , we cite a paper of boutet de monvel , its , and kotlyarov @xcite , where time - periodic boundary conditions are analyzed .",
    "such analysis does not require any preliminary asymptotic analysis of the spectral functions , as they are independent of the asymptotic parameter @xmath47 .",
    "another approach to the asymptotic solution of nonlinearizable boundary value problems is to consider the situation in which the initial and boundary data are small , in which case a perturbation scheme based on the amplitude as a small parameter can be developed in detail , and significantly this allows the global relation to be solved order - by - order .",
    "this means that the asymptotic results obtained are guaranteed to correspond to a compatible dirichlet - neumann pair @xmath62 even though only @xmath24 is given .",
    "the recent papers of fokas and lenells @xcite pursue this approach and obtain new convergence results showing that for small simple harmonic dirichlet boundary data , the solution is eventually periodic with the same period , at least to third order in the small amplitude .",
    "the semiclassical limit is , in a sense , the exact opposite to the weakly - nonlinear small - amplitude limit .",
    "indeed , the formal semiclassical limit is given by the strongly nonlinear hyperbolic system .",
    "there is at least one other paper in the literature on the subject of semiclassical analysis of the dirichlet initial - boundary - value problem on the half - line for the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation , namely a paper of kamvissis @xcite , which directly stimulated our interest in this problem .",
    "like we do , kamvissis considers general nonhomogeneous dirichlet boundary data together with homogeneous initial conditions , and he applies the steepest descent methodology for riemann - hilbert problems to deduce general properties of the solution in the semiclassical limit . our corollary  [ corollary : plane - wave ] is consistent with theorem  5 of @xcite ( the main result of that paper ) albeit in the simplest case of genus @xmath180 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is less clear whether the vacuum domain @xmath152 described by our corollary  [ corollary - vacuum ] is a special case of kamvissis theorem  5 .    while we study the same problem , and apply similar methods , the approach in @xcite is fundamentally different from ours , being based solely on the abstract existence result for the unknown neumann data @xmath63 corresponding to the given dirichlet data @xmath81 .",
    "while kamvissis assumption that @xmath81 is independent of @xmath59 is quite reasonable and physically interesting corresponds to taking @xmath181 .",

    "whether this assumption is justified is certainly not obvious .",
    "indeed one might worry that a slowly - varying dirichlet boundary condition might give rise to a neumann boundary value with rapid variations in amplitude or phase of period proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "for example , our theorem  [ theorem : boundary - condition - recover ] shows that some bounded dirichlet data @xmath67 can lead to rapidly oscillatory neumann data @xmath183 that moreover is large of size @xmath184 .    our approach is to avoid abstract assumptions , and instead make a very explicit assumption , based on the modulated plane - wave ansatz , concerning the unknown neumann data as described in definition  [ definition : d - to - n ] .",
    "this allows us to justify our steepest descent analysis by ultimately tying the solution generated back to the hypothesized initial and boundary data ( theorems  [ theorem : initial - condition - small ] and [ theorem : boundary - condition - recover ] ) in an explicit fashion .",
    "this same approach leads to a very concrete description of the semiclassical dynamics of the solution in the full domain @xmath18 and @xmath78 , as in the characterization of the vacuum domain presented in corollary  [ corollary - vacuum ] .",

    "the method described in @xcite avoids using the @xmath47-part of the lax pair to formulate the inverse problem and instead uses the inverse theory of the spatial part of the lax pair only , at the cost of a more implicit nonlinear description of the time evolution of the jump matrices on the real line .",
    "the fact that the inverse problem is ultimately formulated as a riemann - hilbert problem relative to the real axis may be a crucial benefit in our view ( see remark  [ remark - imaginary - amplify ] ) . in the future ,",

    "<S> initial - boundary value problems for integrable nonlinear partial differential equations have become tractable in recent years due to the development of so - called unified transform techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the main obstruction to applying these methods in practice is that calculation of the spectral transforms of the initial and boundary data requires knowledge of too many boundary conditions , more than are required make the problem well - posed . </S>",
    "<S> the elimination of the unknown boundary values is frequently addressed in the spectral domain via the so - called global relation , and types of boundary conditions for which the global relation can be solved are called _ linearizable_. for the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation , the global relation is only known to be explicitly solvable in rather restrictive situations , namely homogeneous boundary conditions of dirichlet , neumann , and robin ( mixed ) type . </S>",
    "<S> general nonhomogeneous boundary conditions are not known to be linearizable . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an explicit approximation for the nonlinear dirichlet - to - neumann map supplied by the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation and use it to provide approximate solutions of general nonhomogeneous boundary value problems for this equation posed as an initial - boundary value problem on the half - line . </S>",
    "<S> our method sidesteps entirely the solution of the global relation . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of our method is proven in the semiclassical limit , and we provide explicit asymptotics for the solution in the interior of the quarter - plane space - time domain . </S>"
