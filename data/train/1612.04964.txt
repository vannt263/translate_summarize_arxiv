    "low - dimensional electron systems govern the behavior of strongly anisotropic materials ( such as the iron pnictides ) , of graphene , or of quantum dots and wires .",
    "1d or 2d fermions or bosons can also be realized in cold atom setups where elementary equilibrium or real time physics can be probed accurately .",
    "thus , understanding low - dimensional systems is important both fundamentally and for applications in nanoelectronics or the design of functional materials .",
    "however , coulomb interactions lead to a variety of many - body phenomena that can not be obtained by using simple perturbation theory but require more elaborate analytical or numerical techniques .",
    "it is particularly challenging to treat systems which are not in thermal equilibrium .",
    "one area that has attracted considerable attention during the past decades is transport in one dimension where interacting models exist that can be diagonalized exactly using bethe ansatz techniques ; typical examples are xxz spin chains or the fermi - hubbard model @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "local conserved charges can effectively prevent currents from scattering and can thus in principle lead to dissipationless transport at finite temperature @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , even if the whole spectrum of the hamiltonian is known , it remains a formidable task to determine the linear response conductivity quantitatively since it is governed by the couplings between all excited states @xcite , which are difficult to compute in the bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "significant progress has been made within recent years using novel analytical @xcite or numerical @xcite techniques .    .",
    "at time @xmath4 , it is connected to a vacuum state or to a chain exhibiting a different temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the former describes the expansion after switching off a ( sharp ) potential barrier , the latter models the evolution of an initial temperature gradient . ]",
    "studying transport out of equilibrium is complicated and constitutes one of the most active areas of research in strongly correlated condensed matter physics ( for a non - comprehensive list of recent works in this direction , see @xcite ) .",
    "a simple way to probe 1d thermal transport @xcite beyond the regime of linear response is to monitor the real time evolution of an initial , arbitrarily large temperature gradient . despite its general simplicity and experimental realization in quasi-1d spin systems @xcite",
    ", this setup had not been studied theoretically until a few years ago @xcite but has gained considerable attention since then @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend previous works to the 1d fermi - hubbard model and to discuss non - equilibrium setups which are more general than temperature gradients ( and which might thus be of higher relevance for cold atom experiments ) .    from a theoretical perspective , the simplest way to create",
    "a @xmath6-gradient is to prepare two semi - infinite ` left and right ' chains in equilibrium at temperatures @xmath7 and to connect them at time @xmath4 . in general , one expects the system to thermalize after some transient time and hence no energy current @xmath1 to flow across the interface for @xmath8 . in an integrable model , however , it is reasonable to assume that the conserved charges inhibit scattering for arbitrarily large @xmath0 and that @xmath1 acquires a finite steady - state value .",
    "more interestingly , it was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the asymptotic current is not a complicated function of @xmath9 and @xmath5 but rather has a simple form , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a model - dependent function of the temperature .",
    "the derivative of @xmath12 is nothing but the _ linear reponse _ conductance  which thus determines the current even far _ out of equilibrium_. this picture was confirmed analytically for free lattice fermions @xcite and conformal field theories @xcite and tested using density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) numerics for the xxz spin chain @xcite .",
    "however , it is still an open question whether eq .",
    "( [ ffunc ] ) is fulfilled exactly for the interacting xxz chain or violated on a scale that can not be resolved in real - time dmrg calculations @xcite ; moreover , it is unclear if this simple form holds true ( at least approximately ) in _ any _ integrable 1d system .",
    "it is the first goal of this work to shed more light on these issues by revisiting the temperature - gradient setup for the fermi - hubbard model ( fhm ) using the dmrg .",
    "intuitively , one can view eq .",
    "( [ ffunc ] ) as a ` generalized stefan - boltzmann law ' @xcite which describes quasi - particles that radiate freely due to the absence of scattering in an integrable model .",
    "this interpretation suggests that the function @xmath11 could not only describe @xmath6-gradients but govern the thermal currents which flow out of an equilibrated ` left ' chain into _ any _ state on the right as long as the time evolution is dictated by an integrable hamiltonian .",
    "it is the second aim of this paper to collect evidence whether this ` black - body ' hypothesis is true or false .",
    "most importantly , we will study the expansion ( into the vacuum ) after switching off a sharp potential trap .",
    "this exposition is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the model , discuss several ways to prepare the initial state , and briefly sketch the idea of density matrix renormalization group calculations .",

    "sec : t ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vac ] , we show results for the expansion into the vacuum .",
    "the xxz chain is less computationally demanding than the fhm , and the ` black body ' hypothesis can be tested for a larger class of states ; we show data in the appendix .",
    "the one - dimensional fermi - hubbard model is governed by @xmath13 with local terms @xmath14 where @xmath15 annihilates a fermion with spin @xmath16 on site @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the on - site and nearest - neighbor interactions are denoted by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ; the system is integrable for @xmath21 @xcite . throughout this paper ,",

    "the straightforward choice of the initial density matrix @xmath24 is given by the product state @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the statistical operators governing the isolated left and right systems , respectively . in order to model an initial temperature gradient ,",
    "they are both chosen as thermal density matrices featuring different @xmath7 : @xmath27 alternatively , one can employ @xmath28 or @xmath29 in order to study the expansion into the vacuum or into a thermal state of a different hamiltonian @xmath30 , respectively .    .",

    ", the currents saturate to a non - zero stationary - state value . ]        from a numerical perspective , it is advantageous not to work with the product state of eq .",
    "( [ state1 ] ) but to model the ` bond ' between the left and right systems smoothly .",
    "this can be achieved by using @xmath33 and , for the temperature gradient setup , choosing @xmath34 as @xmath35 likewise , one can create a vacuum in the right half by adding a large chemical potential @xmath36 for sites @xmath37 .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the modified hamiltonian @xmath34 only governs the preparation of the initial state ; the real time evolution is always determined by the original @xmath38 of eq .",
    "( [ hub ] ) . since eq .",
    "( [ state1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ state2 ] ) differ only locally , one expects that they yield the same stationary state at long times , which we have verified explicitly .",
    "however , the latter choice is numerically favorable ( the dmrg bond dimension increases more slowly ) ; this is reasonable since the initial state is already ` closer ' to the stationary one if the left and right systems are not fully disconnected initially .",

    "( [ state2 ] ) from now on .",
    "the thermal density matrices @xmath39 as well as the real time evolution operators @xmath40 of one - dimensional systems can be determined by virtue of the time - dependent @xcite density matrix renormalization group method @xcite , which in practice can be set up elegantly using matrix product states @xcite .",
    "finite temperatures @xcite are incorporated via a purification @xmath41 of @xmath39 , and the state @xmath41 can be obtained from the ( known ) @xmath42 using an evolution @xmath43 in @xmath44 .",
    "both @xmath39 as well as @xmath40 are factorized by a fourth order trotter - suzuki decomposition .",
    "we keep the discarded weight during each individual ` bond update ' below a threshold value , which leads to an exponential increase of the bond dimension during the real time evolution . in order to access time scales as large as possible , we employ a finite - temperature disentangler @xcite , which exploits the fact that purification is not unique to slow down the growth of the bond dimension .",
    "our calculations are performed using a system size of the order of @xmath45 sites . by comparing to other values of @xmath46",
    ", we have ensured that @xmath46 is large enough for the results to be effectively in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in this section , we study the energy currents induced by a temperature gradient ( defined by @xmath47 and @xmath5 ) in the fermi - hubbard model .",
    "we exclusively focus on the case of half filling where a charge gap opens for @xmath48 while spin excitation remain gapless .",
    "we always average @xmath49 over the two sites @xmath17 closest to the boundary where the initial @xmath6-gradient is applied ; this average is denoted as @xmath50 from now on .",
    "[ fcurrent ] shows the time evolution of the currents for fixed @xmath31 where the charge gap is of @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "as expected , one observes that @xmath1 relaxes to a non - zero steady - state value in the integrable case of @xmath21 but decay to zero for non - vanishing nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "however , the time scale on which this decay sets in becomes large if both @xmath9 and @xmath5 are below the gap .",
    "it is _ a priori _ unclear whether or not the functional form of the steady - state current given in eq .",
    "( [ ffunc ] ) , which was observed numerically for the xxz chain , holds true ( at least approximately ) also for the fhm ; the reason for this is two - fold .",

    "secondly , it was argued using field theory @xcite that eq .",
    "( [ ffunc ] ) can only hold approximately in the gapped phase of the xxz chain and that small deviations can not be resolved on the time scales reached in the numerics of ref .",

    "[ fhub ] cover two important limits : the weight of the drude peak is minimal around @xmath53 @xcite ( the regular contribution to the conductivity vanishes both for @xmath56 and @xmath64 ) , and the temperatures reached at @xmath31 are significantly below the charge gap .",

    "( [ ffunc ] ) can be interpreted intuitively in terms of quasi - particles which do not scatter but radiate freely in integrable models . however , if this picture was correct , then it should be valid for any initial setup  not only temperature gradients .",
    "in other words , the energy currents flowing out of a left system which is prepared in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath9 should be universally described by @xmath70 irrespective of the initial state of the right system  which should only modify the constant @xmath71  as long as the time evolution is governed by an integrable hamiltonian @xmath38 .    the most important test for this ` black - body ' hypothesis is an expansion into a vacuum state , which can be viewed as preparing an equilibrated system in the presence of a sharp potential trap which",

    "[ fvac ] , we show the currents flowing into the vacuum with the thermal ones for @xmath72 ; on the accessible time scales , their steady - state again coincides up to a constant which does not depend on @xmath9 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath73 holds true at least approximately and supports the ` black body ' hypothesis . due to the computational complexity of the hubbard model , we refrain from studying the expansion into various other non - thermal states but will carry out such an analysis for the simpler case of the xxz chain ( see the appendix ) .",

    "moreover , one should keep in mind that while the hubbard model does not feature a fully - conserved energy current , most of the spectral weight of the equilibrium conductivity is concentrated in the drude peak @xcite .",

    "the ` black - body ' form @xmath79 , which can be interpreted in terms of quasi - particles which propagate freely under the time evolution of an integrable hamiltonian , is interesting for three reasons : firstly , it implies that the currents even far out of equilibrium are determined by the linear - response conductance @xmath84 @xcite .",
