    "nucleation is often heterogeneous and is assisted by the presence of a substrate or wall and impurities .",

    "further theoretical analysis has been necessary because of the mathematical complexity of the problem  @xcite .",

    "in this paper , we have studied an old problem of the line - tension effect on a lens - shaped nucleus ( liquid droplet ) on a spherical substrate and in a spherical cavity . by minimizing the helmholtz free energy , we reproduced the generalized young formula determined by previous authors  @xcite to determine the contact angle .",
    "then , we studied the work of formation ( nucleation barrier ) of the critical nucleus by maximizing the gibbs free energy together with the generalized young formula .",
    "we determined that the work of formation consists of the usual volume contribution and the line contribution due to the line tension .",
    "the former for the nucleus on a spherical substrate coincides with that obtained originally by fletcher  @xcite .",
    "the volume contribution suggests that the convex spherical surface will not enhance the heterogeneous nucleation as the nucleation approaches homogeneous nucleation .",
    "however , the concave spherical surface will enhance the heterogeneous nucleation , as the free energy barrier will be lower .",
    "the line contribution depends sensitively on the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the substrate . on a hydrophilic spherical substrate",
    ", the line contribution can be maximized when the radius of the substrate is finite .",
    "however , it can be maximized when the radius is finite for a hydrophobic cavity .",
    "although , we have used a spherical lens model and assumed that the liquid - solid interaction is represented by the short - ranged contact interaction represented by the surface tension , it is possible to include long - ranged liquid - solid interaction using the concept of disjoining pressure .",
    "several studies  @xcite have already examined the effect of the long - range force .",
    "however , most studies have focused on the problem of a spherical nucleus around a spherical substrate without the three - phase contact line  @xcite rather than a lens - shaped nucleus with the three - phase contact line .",
    "although there are numerous studies on lens - shaped nuclei on flat substrates when the long - ranged disjoining pressure exists  @xcite , investigations of the lens - shaped nuclei on spherical substrates are scarce and remain qualitative as the result is only numerical  @xcite .",
    "in additon , we have assumed that the liquid - vapor interface is sharp .",
    "there are also several studies  @xcite that include diffuse interfaces .",
    "our results in this paper can serve as a guide in the development of more realistic models of lens - shaped nuclei on curved surfaces to include the disjoining pressure and diffuse interface effect .",

    "<S> the line - tension effects on heterogeneous nucleation are considered when a spherical lens - shaped nucleus is nucleated on top of a spherical substrate and on the bottom of the wall of a spherical cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of line tension on the nucleation barrier can be separated from the usual volume term . as the radius of the substrate increases , the nucleation barrier decreases and approaches that of a flat substrate . however , as the radius of the cavity increases , the nucleation barrier increases and approaches that of a flat substrate . </S>",
    "<S> a small spherical substrate is a less active nucleation site than a flat substrate , and a small spherical cavity is a more active nucleation site than a flat substrate . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the line - tension effect on the nucleation barrier is maximum when the radii of the nucleus and the substrate or cavity become comparable . </S>",
