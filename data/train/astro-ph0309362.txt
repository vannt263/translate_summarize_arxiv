    "it has been suggested that the proper motions of pulsars  @xcite may be caused by a slight assymetry in the ejection of neutrinos  @xcite , which carry away most of the energy of a supernova .",
    "in fact , it would take only a 1 % assymetry in the neutrino emmission to achieve the observed neutron star velocities .",
    "such an assymetry could be caused by neutrino oscillations in matter , in a strong magnetic field .",
    "although neutrino magnetic moments are negligible , the neutrino interactions with matter depend on the polarization of matter fermions  @xcite .",
    "the viability of the neutrino kick mechanism has been discussed at length in several papers @xcite .",
    "this mechanism can work if there is a sterile neutrino with mass 1 - 20 kev and a small , @xmath0 , mixing with the electron neutrino .",
    "it is intriguing , that the same neutrino could make up the cosmological dark matter  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , detection of such a neutrino in a terrestrial experiment is probably not feasible at present because the mixing angle @xmath1 is very small .",
    "however , in the event of a nearby supernova , the asymmetric emission of neutrinos from a rotating nascent neutron star can produce gravity waves that may be detectable .",
    "in this paper we will describe the expected gravity waves ( gw ) from a pulsar kick due to neutrino conversions taking into account the rotation of the neutron star and the neutrino asymmetry associated with this mechanism .",
    "detection of such a signal can help understand the origin of the pulsar kicks .",
    "gravitational waves from the supernova neutrinos have been considered in the literature@xcite .",
    "however , the source geometry was assumed somewhat different from that specific to the neutrino kick mechanism .",
    "epstein  @xcite has calculated the burst radiation assuming the distribution of neutrinos is roughly elliptical .",
    "the assymetry was assumed to arise due to flattening by centripetal motion .",
    "burrows and hayes  @xcite performed a hydrodynamic simulation of a supernova with some imposed initial assymetry .",
    "cuesta  @xcite described the burst radiation from the sudden neutrino conversions .",
    "he has also proposed that the gws themselves may be the source of the neutron star momentum kick , through their radiation back reaction  @xcite .",
    "however , there is an additional , and possibly stronger , source of gravitational radiation due to the asymmetric emission of neutrinos from a rapidly rotating neutron star .",
    "one can think of the escaping neutrinos as forming an off - centered rotating beam , at some angle to the rotation axis , superimposed on a spherically symmetric distribution .",
    "the symmetric component does not produce gravity waves , but the 1% of all neutrinos that make up the asymmetric `` beam '' are a source of a periodic gw signal .",
    "we will adopt epstein s notation  @xcite , with a few minor modifications .",
    "we define the nontensor potentials @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the metric .",
    "indeces of all non - tensors are raised and lowered with the minkowski metric @xmath4 also , we define @xmath5 , and take @xmath6 . this allows us to write the einstein field equations as @xmath7 with the gauge condition @xmath8 here we followed epstein in defining @xmath9 @xmath10 is the matter stress - energy tensor and @xmath11 is the suitably defined gravitational stress - energy pseudo - tensor .    equation ( [ einstein ] ) is in the form of a wave equation in flat space .",
    "its solution for outgoing wave boundary conditions is @xmath12 at any field point @xmath13 .",
    "we will assume all gravitational fields are weak enough that we may evaluate equations ( [ stress - energy ] ) and ( [ intsol ] ) to leading order in @xmath14 .",
    "following epstein  @xcite , let us consider a source of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "this form describes neutrinos continuously released from @xmath20 at the speed of light .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the rate of energy loss ( luminosity ) and angular distribution , respectively . in the weak field limit ,",
    "it is safe to treat all neutrinos as orriginating from @xmath20 and to use @xmath23const as an approximation to a null geodesic .    to obtain the detectable radiation we must find the transverse traceless ( tt ) part of the source",
    "this can be done either with a projector or with a gauge transformation .",

    "thus , we can write the time rate of change of @xmath57 as @xmath58    we see that there are two contributions .",
    "the first is due to the new neutrinos being ejected at @xmath59 , the ones whose effect is just becoming visible .",
    "the other , is due to the change in the effect of previously ejected neutrinos , as their distance and angle change .",
    "however , this second term is suppressed by an extra factor of @xmath60 , so it is negligible as long as the radiation lasts for a time that is short compared to the distance between the source and the observer .",
    "( in a supernova , the event is about 10 s and the distance is thousands of light years so we can safely ignore this term . )    for the first term , since @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the angular terms simplify greatly .",
    "all of the @xmath63 terms drop out and we find @xmath64",
    "at this point we simply need to choose a distribution @xmath66 to find the form of the radiation .",
    "the simplest is just a @xmath65 function in a particular direction .",
    "in essence , we are modeling the slight neutrino excess to one side as a @xmath65-function jet . in reality",
    "the @xmath65 function introduces some spurious results , but it also provides a basis for more accurate results . let @xmath67 then we find @xmath68 the most striking feature is that while the radiation is suppressed for @xmath69 when the neutrino jet is away from the the observer as expected , there is no suppression near @xmath70 when the jet is toward the observer .",
    "we will see later that this is one of the spurious effects of the @xmath65-function",
    ".    the neutrino jet s motion could be quite complex .",
    "we will focus on one simplified possibility where the jet precesses at an angular frequency @xmath71 around an axis that is inclined at an angle @xmath50 relative to the @xmath39-axis , and always makes an angle of @xmath72 relative to that axis . for simplicity",
    "we will always assume that the axis of precession is in the @xmath73-plane .",
    "rotating it away from this plane can be handled most easily by rotating the observer s axes .    if @xmath61 then the radiation is simply @xmath74 which is just circularly polarized gravitational radiation at an angular frequency of @xmath75 which is exactly what we would expect .    if we move @xmath50 away from the @xmath39-axis .",
    "things get more complicated . by simply rotating the axes we can find @xmath76 where we have let @xmath77 .",
    "using these gives us gravitational radiation that is elliptically polarized and and contains components at all angular frequencies @xmath78 where @xmath79 is an integer .",
    "the radiation is generally dominated by @xmath71 and @xmath80 components , and in fact we will find that the higher frequency terms are spurious effects of the @xmath65-function .",
    "the magnitude of any particular fourier component is then @xmath81 @xmath82 is the luminosity of neutrinos , @xmath83 is the excess in one direction ( about 1% ) , @xmath71 is the frequency of the radiation ( not the frequency of precession this time ) , and @xmath84 is the length of time over which the neutrinos are released .",
    "( for burst radiation this would be a factor of @xmath85 ) .",
    "the @xmath65-function is of course an idealizaton .",
    "the excess of neutrino energy in one direction is caused by the magnetic field and is expected to be of the form @xmath86 this distribution is chosen so that it has only a uniform and a dipole contribution .",
    "the numerical factors are chosen so that @xmath87 and @xmath88 . here",
    "@xmath83 is again the fractional excess of neutrino momentum in one direction compared to the other , and @xmath89 is the angle to the magnetic axis .",
    "if the magnetic axis points in the @xmath90 direction , and we are looking in the @xmath91 direction , then it is easy enough to find @xmath92    if we now insert equations ( [ alexform ] ) and ( [ costildetheta ] ) into equations ( [ thetaxx ] ) and ( [ thetaxy ] ) each term of the integral over @xmath93 will take one of the following three forms : @xmath94 all three are zero , so the result for @xmath95 and @xmath96 is identically @xmath97 . this is a reflection of the fact that there is no gravitational dipole radiation .    the first term that will produce noticable radiation is the quadrupole term which we will write in the form @xmath98 this is actually not a true quadrupole as it has a monopole contribution , but that is irrelevant as monopoles will not create gws .",
    "the factor of @xmath99 is to remain consistent with equation ( [ alexform ] ) .",
    "the factor of @xmath100 represents the strength of this term .",
    "it is left general , but we would expect that if the dipole term is suppressed by the factor @xmath83 , the quadrupole term should be suppressed by two factors of e so that @xmath101 .    if equation ( [ quadform ] ) is inserted into ( [ thetaxx ] ) and ( [ thetaxy ] ) then we get @xmath102 this is nearly the same result as the @xmath65-function case except for the numerical factor and a @xmath103 instead of @xmath104 .",
    "this small change results in suppressed radiation whenever the predominiant neutrino direction is alligned with the observer s line of sight .",
    "( because it is a quadrupole term , there is no distinction between aligned and anti - aligned . ) even more interesting , if we allow the axis of rotation to be different from the @xmath39-axis as we did in the case of the @xmath65-function , we find that we only have constant terms and terms with angular frequency @xmath71 and @xmath75 .",
    "all of the higher frequency terms are absent .",
    "unfortunately , it seems at first glance that @xmath101 so this radiation is likely to be suppressed by two more orders of magnitude and may be unobservable .",
    "the best chance of observing such gravitational waves is from an object with a large quadrupole moment .",
    "the pulsar kick mechanism based on neutrino conversions  @xcite predicts an asymmetric neutrino emission whose strength and direction are determined by the magnetic field inside the neutron star .",
    "the magnetic fields deep inside the neutron stars are believed to grow during the first seconds after the supernova collapse ( @xmath105 dynamo effect  @xcite ) because of convection .",
    "the cooling of the outer regions of the star creates the temperature and entropy gradient that causes convection in these outer regions .",
    "it is likely , therefore , that the strongest magnetic field develops away from the central region and that the overall magnetic field has a large non - dipole component . since the neutrino emission is affected by this magnetic field , the asymmetric part of the neutrinos can form an off - centered beam .",
    "this , in turn creates a source for gw with a large quadrupole moment .",
    "here we consider two cases , which correspond to resonant and off - resonant conversions of neutrinos in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "let us consider a @xmath106-field of the form @xmath107 here @xmath108 is the distance from some magnetic axis , @xmath109 is the magnetic field at the center of the star and @xmath110 is the distance from the magnetic axis to the center of the star .",
    "this is the simplest model that has no singularity in the current at the magnetic axis and represents charged particles circling with a constant angular velocity so that the current increases linearly with @xmath108 .",
    "this model is based on cylindrical symmetry so it is a simplification for our case , but it should be sufficient for an order of magnitude estimate .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the radius at which neutrinos escape can be described as @xmath111 @xmath112 the only change from the reference is that i ll allow @xmath106 to vary with distance from the magnetic axis .",
    "for simplicity i ll place the magnetic axis in the @xmath73 plane .",
    "then we can find @xmath65 as a function of @xmath89 and @xmath113 : @xmath114 ; \\label{realquad2}\\ ] ] @xmath115 is the same as @xmath65 in the reference ( except with the assumed constant b - field replaced by the b field at the origin . )",
    "the value @xmath116 is simply the ratio of the unperturbed escape radius to the distance between the magnetic axis and the center of the star @xmath117 .",
    "both distances can be a significant fraction of the star s overall size and are not correlated so @xmath116 is most likely of order 1 and can be greater or less than 1 .",
    "the first term is the one discussed in ref.@xcite it is responsible for the momentum kick and as demonstrated causes no gravitational radiation .",
    "the last term is mainly @xmath118 and also does nt contribute to the gravity waves .",
    "the middle term however , is a quadrupole term and does create gravity waves .    its worth noting that while this is actually a measure of how much the neutrinosphere deviates from the sphere , it is assumed that the neutrinos , responding to their environment , will have an energy spectrum that mimics the radius distribution .",
    "@xmath119\\right ) .",
    "\\label{realquad}\\ ] ] this distribution has been chosen to have a large monopole term , and a perturbing term of the same form as equation ( [ realquad2 ] ) .",
    "like equation ( [ alexform ] ) it has been normalized so that @xmath120 and @xmath121 where @xmath83 represents the fractional momentum excess in one direction .",
    "the next task is to find @xmath122 in terms of @xmath123 . as i already discussed",
    ", @xmath124 is the projection of the @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) vector ( the integration direction ) onto the @xmath127 ( @xmath128)vector ( the direction of the magnetic field axis ) . essentially , the radial direction is the z direction for the tilde variables , and @xmath124 is the projection onto this axis .",
    "by contrast @xmath129 is the projection onto the @xmath116-axis for the tilde variables .",
    "since @xmath127 is the @xmath130-direction , the @xmath131-direction has to be in the @xmath132 , @xmath133 plane , but it can be any linear combination of these .",
    "so i ll let it be @xmath134 in terms of the standard @xmath135 directions we can write @xmath136 which means @xmath137 @xmath138 substituting this into equation [ realquad ] and in turn into the gw equations ( [ thetaxx ] and [ thetaxy ] ) we get @xmath139 here @xmath140 .",
    "clearly there is radiation and there is no extra suppression compared to the dipole term .",
    "there is now a wider variety of radiation producing motions .",
    "not only can we allow @xmath33 and @xmath141 to change based on rotation about some axis , but @xmath50 can also change .",
    "however , if we assume a simple rotation of angular frequency @xmath71 then @xmath50 will be linked to the rotation angle . there can be a phase difference between them @xmath142 , but @xmath143 goes to 0 if the magnetic and rotation axes are coplanar or @xmath144 when maximally skewed .",
    "there is now an extra factor of the rotation angle which adds significant radiation at a frequency of @xmath145 as well as @xmath71 and @xmath75 .",
    "the maximally skewed case is to be expected if the neutrino kick is also driving the neutron star s rotation as in @xcite .",
    "this could also suppress the translational kick and make the gravity waves larger than expected relative to the proper motion .",
    "if the active - to - sterile neutrino conversions occur off - resonance , the sterile neutrinos are emitted from the entire core of the star  @xcite .",
    "such emission is only possible after the electroweak matter potential is driven to zero by neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this case , the sterile emission can begin several seconds after the on set of the supernova .",
    "more importantly , this emission may last for a period of time that could be as long as 10 s , but can also be much shorter .",
    "this depends on the neutrino mass and mixing parameters .",
    "the emission of neutrinos in the solid angle @xmath146 is @xmath147 .",
    "the dependence on the magnetic field is more complicated than in previous models .",
    "however , we can get a reasonable order of magnitude estimate by parametrizing the emission in the same way as ( [ realquad2 ] ) .",
    "specifically the gravity wave generating term will take the form @xmath148 this must be integrated over all radii where neutrinos are emitted .",
    "assuming they are uniformally emitted throughout the core ( i.e. no explicit dependence on radius ) the final form will be @xmath149    except for the extra factor of @xmath150 the result is the same as for the resonant case and will yield a similar magnitude signal .",
    "we are now ready to consider the magnitude of the radiation . in a typical supernova ,",
    "neutrinos carry away about @xmath151 ergs over a period of several seconds .",
    "so @xmath152 is approximately the average luminosity @xmath153 erg / s where @xmath84 is the total time of neutrino emmision .",
    "the magnitude of the gravity waves is then @xmath154 @xmath155 is the function of angles appearing in equation ( [ realquadgw ] ) .",
    "@xmath156 merely represents the collection of angles .    to be compared with experiment",
    ", this result needs to be integrated with respect to time and fourier transformed . in the fourier",
    "transform all three major components ( @xmath71 , @xmath75 , and @xmath145 ) have amplitudes of order @xmath157 , and integrating is equivalent to dividing by the angular frequency .    the units must be changed also .",
    "the gaussian noise must be fourier transformed in a way that gives it units of @xmath158 . to adjust for this",
    "we must divide by the square root of the frequency for a burst source , or multiply by the square root of @xmath84 for a periodic source @xcite .",
    "since neutron stars have typical frequencies of several khz , and the burst is expected to last a few seconds , we should generally treat this as a periodic source .",
    "however , in the case of lower frequency signals detectable by lisa , the burst description may be more appropriate .",
    "the final result is @xmath159 for periodic signals , or @xmath160 for a burst signal . in both cases",
    "@xmath161 represents the frequency of the radiation , not the star rotation .",
    "( thus , @xmath161 will be 1 , 2 , or 3 times the frequency of star rotation . )",
    "ligo is most sensitive in the @xmath162 - @xmath163 hz range , neutron stars rotating at this rate are likely to undergo several rotations in the neutrino ejection time and therefore equation ( [ periodic ] ) is most appropriate in describing ligo s sensitivity to gravity waves figure [ ligofig ] .",
    "lisa by contrast is most sensitive in the @xmath164 - @xmath165 hz range .",
    "neutron stars rotating at this rate are likely to undergo only part of a rotation , or at most a few rotations in the neutrino ejection time .",

    "unfortunately , lisa s frequency range is very low and it would only see gws from very slowly rotating neutrino beams .",
    "the total power and energy carried by the the gravity wave are simply @xmath168 where @xmath169 can be given by any of the several equations for this quantity as appropriate . inserting equation ( [ mag1 ] )",
    "this means that the energy carried away by gravity waves will be about @xmath165 erg / @xmath170 or a total of about @xmath171 erg .    by comparison ,",

    "by contrast , other signals have their power spread out over a large , fairly continuous range of frequencies . in certain ideal situations individual cycles of the radiation may be recognizable",
    ". this should allow the periodic signal to be distinguished from other processes including those that contain more total energy .",
    "we have shown that , in the event of a nearby supernova , gravitational waves caused by an asymmetric neutrino emission may be strong enough to be detected by ligo and lisa .",
    "we have assumed that the asymmetry in outgoing neutrinos is as large as 1% , as suggested by the observed pulsar velocities . as can be seen from the figures , quickly rotating neutron stars",
    "may be seen by ligo advanced , and more slowly rotating ones by lisa .",
    "this signal also has the distinguishing feature of having large radiation components at @xmath161 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 .",
    "this could be used for recognizing gravity waves from rotating neutrino beams .",
    "this mechanism could also be recognized by its short time duration and possible coincidence with neutrino and optical signals from the supernova .",
    "if such a signal is detected and identified , it would have profound implications for one s understanding of the supernova , as well as neutrino physics .",
