    "in the previous paper @xcite ( part i ) following ref s @xcite and @xcite we have calculated the magnetic anisotropy for a magnetic impurity embodied into a non - magnetic host ( e.g. au , cu ) with large spin - orbit interaction for the conduction electrons on the sites of the host atoms .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy is developed due to the exchange interaction between the magnetic impurities and the conduction electrons .",
    "as the scattering due to impurities involves different angular momentum channels ( @xmath0 ) , therefore , the scattering depends on the directions of the conduction electrons before and after the scattering . in that way the scattering on the impurity itself depends on which host atoms the electrons",
    "are scattered by the spin - orbit interaction . due to that dependence",
    "the anisotropy is determined by the positions of host atoms around the impurity and it is the larger the stronger the asymmetry around the impurity . as that information is carried by the momenta , therefore , that is restricted to the atoms in the range of the elastic mean free path @xmath1 .",
    "thus the anisotropy can be developed only if the impurity is inside surface area of the thickness of the elastic mean free path ( ballistic region of the surface ) .",
    "if the surface in that region is plane like then the anisotropy energy is ( see eq .  ( 1 ) of part i @xcite ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the spin operator of the impurity , @xmath4 is the normal direction of the experienced surface element , and @xmath5 is the anisotropy constant depending apart from the oscillatory part like @xmath6 on the distance @xmath7 , measured from the surface . of course , if the ballistic region contains more sophisticated part of the surface , then the determination of the direction and amplitude of the anisotropy is a more complex task .",
    "the oscillatory part decays faster than @xmath6 approaching the bulk part of the sample ( see eq .",
    "( b20b ) in part i ) .    in the surface area",
    "the anisotropy energy leads to different splitting schema shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , depending whether the spin @xmath8 is integer or half - integer . in this way the spin very nearby the surface is freezing into a singlet or doublet considering the integer and half - integer case , respectively .",
    "thus at low enough temperature the spin shows no , or restricted dynamics .",
    "it is important to point out , that the states @xmath9 for @xmath10 can not be replaced by a doublet of @xmath11 .",
    "the spins are rather squeezed into planar states as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] .    assuming that @xmath12 , the integer spin does not contributes to the resistivity in contrary with the case of the half - integer spin where the two lowest states contributes to the resistivity .",
    "the spin @xmath11 is , however , not affected by anisotropy .",
    "thus different behaviors of the electrical resistivity can be expected depending on the value of the spin .",
    "considering impurities nearby the surface inside the ballistic region more and more orbitals become active as the impurity positions approaching the bulk ( see fig .  [ fig03 ] ) .",
    "similar structure appears in the temperature dependence of the resistivity .",
    "cooling down the sample , at the beginning almost all the spins are free . at further cooling more and more spin states",
    "are frozen in thus in case @xmath13 at @xmath14 three orbitals and @xmath15 a single orbital is populated ( @xmath16 ) while in case of @xmath10 each state is double degenerate ( @xmath17 ) .    assuming",
    "that in the region of the kondo temperature @xmath18 the occupations of the different states are varying by considerable amount depending on the positions of the impurities in the surface region , then lowering the temperature less and less impurities can further develop the kondo state , thus less and less impurities can contribute to further increase of the kondo resistivity . as it has already been pointed out the reduction in the contribution to resistivity somewhat less pronounced for half - integer spin than for integer spin ( see the discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) .",
    "the contribution to the kondo resistivity can be schematically plotted for impurities with different distances measured from the surface @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] ) .",
    "the phenomena described above are very similar to the kondo effect in the presence of crystalline field at the impurity site when lowering the temperature different crystal field states are frozen out , but those fields are identical for all impurities of the same kind .",
    "such calculations have been performed e.g. by shin - ichi kashiba _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the reduction in the averaged kondo resistivity is sensitive on the size of the sample e.g. film thickness or diameter of the wire etc .",
    "as the ratio of the surface influenced impurities to the total number of the impurities goes to zero as the size is further increased .",
    "the role of the surface on the impurities can be reduced by depositing another pure film on the surface of the sample .",
    "the effect can be also influenced by changing the elastic mean free path in the samples or in the deposited films .",
    "the effects of those kinds will be summarized and discussed at the end of the paper ( see sec .  [ sec:7 ] ) making use the qualitative results obtained for the resistivity in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] and [ sec:6 ] and all of the references can be found there .    for the actual calculation of the resistivity first the temperature dependence of the effective exchange coupling must be calculated .",
    "for that , except the very low temperature region , the second order multiplicative renormalization group transformations ( two - loops approximation ) can be used which give smooth behavior at the kondo temperature in contrast to the first order scaling ( one - loop approximation ) which results in an artificial divergence at the kondo temperature .",
    "those methods are generalized by taking into account the surface anisotropy terms which occur as a low energy cutoff of the logarithmic integrals in the calculation of certain diagrams .",
    "the different diagrams depending on their spin labels have different infrared , low energy cutoff due to the anisotropy .",
    "these calculations are in close analogy to those with crystalline splitting .",
    "the next step is using these effective couplings to calculate the electrical resistivity by solving the boltzmann equation and an average over the impurity positions is taken also .",
    "finally , to fit the calculated resistivity at low temperature , an effective surface layer thickness @xmath20 can be introduced , by assuming that inside of that surface region there is no kondo effect , and outside the kondo anomaly is fully developed .",

    "giordano and his collaborators ( see for a review @xcite ) have performed a series of different experiments under different conditions where the size effect was observed but the changes in the kondo temperature were almost negligible .",
    "the experiments of different type are listed below .",
    "( i ) : :    dependence on film thickness .",
    "+    the film experiments with thickness    @xmath218 were performed e.g. with    @xmath206 ppm fe in au , but similar results are obtained also    for @xmath216 ppm @xcite .",
    "the resistivity was fitted    by the formula @xmath219 where    @xmath191 is an adjustable parameter .",
    "it is well known for the    kondo systems that @xmath191 is just not the result of the first    non - vanishing third order perturbational result where @xmath191    would be @xmath220 , but it is the actual slope nearby or    somewhat above the kondo temperature ( see for example @xcite ) . in the    actual experiments the temperature range",
    "@xmath221 k was    studied while @xmath222 k. the dependence of that    coefficient @xmath191 on thickness was plotted as shown in    fig .",
    "[ kisfit ] .",
    "the experimental results are fitted by the calculated    dependence of @xmath191 on the thickness with parameter    @xmath193 k and by the    semi - phenomenological formula given by eq .",
    "( [ efflambda ] ) with the    effective suppression layer parameter value    @xmath198 in fig .",
    "[ kisfit ] @xcite .",
    "that value of @xmath165 is in agreement with the estimate    given in part i @xcite by eq .",
    "there was not any signal for    essential change in the kondo temperature @xcite in agreement with    our theoretical result .",
    "it is interesting to note that the estimated    kondo coherence length was about @xmath223 ,    much larger than the thickness of the sample .",
    "similar experiments were    performed with wires where more geometrical effects are expected , but    the results are qualitatively similar but not identical . the simple    semi - phenomenological formula given by eq .",
    "( [ efflambda ] ) is not    appropriate in those cases .",
    "qualitatively very similar results are    reported in @xcite but there are quantitative differences very likely    due to the sample preparation .",
    "( ii ) : :    kondo proximity effect .",
    "+    a set of experiments @xcite were performed where the film of    dilute alloys is covered by a second layer of pure metal .",
    "the    observation was , that in the case of a thin layer of dilute alloys    with a significant suppression of the kondo effect the covering by a    second pure film results in partial recovery of that suppression . in    fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] with the suppression layers indicated it is shown that    the bilayer structure has a suppression layer only on one side of the    film of dilute alloys , thus only one half of the suppression is    expected . in order to verify the importance of the role of the    spin - orbit interaction in the superimposed layer to complete the    neighborhood of the impurity with a uniform spin - orbit coupling , we    suggest experiments where the superimposed layer has negligible    spin - orbit interaction ( e.g. al or mg ) . in that case",
    "the boundary is    changed , but the anisotropy should remain .",
    "( iii ) : :    kondo proximity effect with overlayers with different disorder .",
    "+    it has been shown experimentally @xcite that the kondo resistivity    suppression in a film of dilute alloys covered by a pure film but with    different disorder depends on the disorder in the overlayer .",
    "it was    found that the larger the disorder the smaller the recovery is .",
    "as it    is discussed above if the thickness of the overlayer and the mean free    path @xmath1 in it are larger than the thickness    of the suppression layer @xmath20 , then the depression    takes place only on one side of the film of dilute alloys .",
    "on the    other hand , if the pure overlayers contains disorder , then the    electron entering that overlayer can not bring back information to the    magnetic impurity by their momenta , as their momenta is changed in the    overlayer ( the overlayer is not in the ballistic regime ) . in these    cases",
    "the reduction in the anisotropy is only partially developed as    the surroundings of the impurity is not perfectly spherical in    contrast to the case of overlayer with long mean free path .",
    "in contrast to the measurements discussed in [ sub : b ] there is a series of experiments by chandrasekhar _",
    "@xcite where the size dependence was not found .",
    "the geometries of these experiments were different , the thickness of the sample @xmath163 was kept the same ( @xmath224 ) , but the width of the stripes @xmath225 was changed between @xmath226 ( see fig .  [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "after the correction due to the weak localization effects and due to electron - electron interaction no size dependence was claimed . on the basis of the present theory , for samples @xmath227 no size dependence",
    "is expected as the ratio of the volume of the suppression layers to the total volume is not changing . where @xmath228 the anisotropy due to the geometry becomes more complicated ,",
    "thus it is hard to make comparison with the present theory . on the other hand for @xmath228 the experimental points are somewhat falling off from the main averaged line ,",
    "that , of course , may be due to experimental errors . according to the present theory the averaged kondo resistivity for @xmath229 had to be smaller than the bulk resistivity , but it seems to be not the case @xcite .",
    "finally it should be mentioned that no size effect was observed studying @xmath230 films where ce has @xmath11 for which no surface anisotropy is expected @xcite .",
    "there are several experiments @xcite with higher impurity concentration .",
    "in these cases the impurity - impurity interaction mediated by the rkky interaction competes with the kondo effect . in another set of experiments @xcite the thickness of the film",
    "were changed in samples made of cu with @xmath231 ppm cr and it was found very similar depression of the kondo effect described above in sec .  [ sub : b ] . the wires with geometries similar to those discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : c ] but with @xmath232 ppm impurities do not show dependence on the width @xmath7 @xcite , but the overall amplitude is substantially su - pressed compared to the bulk , which was attributed to spin - glass effects .",
    "in the present paper the influence of the spin - orbit induced surface anisotropy is studied on the kondo effect in dilute magnetic alloys samples of finite size at least in one dimension .",
    "that anisotropy splits the energy levels for impurity spin @xmath233 .",
    "that anisotropy reduces as the bulk part of the sample is approached relatively slowly as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the distance of the impurity measured from the surface . that anisotropy occurs for samples of any shape , but for those cases further theories should be developed .",
    "the range where the anisotropy is relevant can be characterized by the suppression length @xmath20 introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] , which is proportional to the strength of the anisotropy but limited by the mean free path of the electron as the anisotropy reflects the presence of the surface in the ballistic region nearby the impurity .",
    "thus that suppression length can not exceed a few hundred @xmath234 in accordance with the experiments discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : b ] .",
    "that anisotropy hinders the motion of the impurity spin @xmath8 if @xmath233 and the kondo effect is affected in those regions of the samples where the anisotropy is not negligible relative to the kondo temperature @xmath18 . in order to calculate the kondo resistivity",
    "the renormalized exchange coupling constants are calculated in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] by using the multiplicative renormalization group technique which is applicable only for temperatures @xmath94 larger than the kondo temperature @xmath18 , thus no detailed prediction can be made outside that region .",
    "it can be accepted , however , that if the kondo effect is already reduced in region @xmath235 similar effect is expected also for @xmath162 .",
    "the resistivity is calculated by solving the boltzmann equation in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] for integer and half - integer spins with different anisotropy strength . even if the calculated resistivity curves in fig",
    ".  [ fig6 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show different characteristic features by developing a resistivity maxima at different temperatures and of different amplitudes , those features are almost loosen as an average over the strength of the anisotropy is taken for @xmath235 .",
    "the curves calculated for thin films ( see fig .  [ figatlagolt ] ) show smooth increase of the resistivity .",
    "more structures could be expected only in those experiments where the impurities are in certain distance measured from the surface .",
    "if the anisotropy does not dominate the complete sample then as the result of the average taken the largest resistivity slope as a function of temperature is in the region of the kondo temperature @xmath18 , and its position can not be shifted too much on the scale of the kondo temperature @xmath18 . that theoretical result is in accordance with the experimental findings ( see sec .",
    "[ sub : b ] ) .",
    "the relatively weak sensitivity of the observed region of the largest resistivity slope on the size of the samples rules out the density states effects nearby the surface in contrast to the point contact experiments ( see sec .",
    "[ sub : a ] ) . the size dependence associated with the large kondo compensation cloud",
    "is not observed in agreement with the kondo theory where such a simple connection is ruled out .",
    "the calculated kondo resistivity for thin films was fitted for temperatures @xmath187 ( @xmath188 k ) by the function @xmath189 which is compared to the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ kisfit ] and gives excellent agreement .",
    "the phenomenological theory using the effective suppression length @xmath20 ( see sec .  [ sec:6 ] ) works remarkable well to interpret qualitatively the experimental data quoted in sec .",
    "[ sec:7 ] . the fit of the experimental data",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ kisfit ] .",
    "the different proximity effects described in sec .  [ sub : b ] can be also well explained by the present theory .",
    "it is important that the role of mean free path ( sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] , see fig .",
    "[ aperte ] ) reduces the effect of the large anisotropy constant , thus for a large range of strong anisotropy the size dependence remains in a limited range as far as the elastic mean free paths are in the same order of magnitude . in this way",
    "the size effect can be comparable for different host materials with different large spin - orbit interactions but with comparable elastic mean free path .",
    "we have to emphasize , however , that our calculation does not consider the localization effects which are present in samples of larger sizes .",
    "such effect have recently been predicted by martin , wan and phillips @xcite and deserves further detailed studies .",
    "in addition to those localization effects the theoretical studies must be extended to the microscopic calculations of the anisotropy constant .",
    "considering further experiments the mean free path effects should be studied .",
    "the most relevant experiment to directly verify the role of the spin - orbit interaction could be the proximity experiments where the superimposed layer would be made of another metal without spin - orbit interaction as it is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : b ] . in those cases",
    "the uniform surrounding of the impurity would not be developed , thus the anisotropy remains .",
    "furthermore , the experiments with impurities in a certain distance measured from the surface would be also very instructive .",
    "summarizing , the presented theory is able to provide a coherent description of the size effects of the kondo resistivity in thin films , which is not related to the size of the kondo compensation cloud in any sense .",
