    "eriksen , kristiansen , langangen , and wehus recently analyzed usain bolt s 100 m sprint at the 2008 summer olympics in beijing and speculated what the world record would have been had he not slowed down in celebration near the end of his race.@xcite they analyzed two scenarios for the last two seconds  the same acceleration as the second place runner ( richard thompson ) or bolt s acceleration was 0.5m / s@xmath0 greater than thompson s .",
    "they found race times of @xmath1s and @xmath2s for the first and second scenarios , respectively . in comparison ,",
    "bolt s actual race time in beijing was 9.69s .",
    "the predictions in ref .",
    "were apparently confirmed at the 2009 world championships in athletics in berlin ( race time 9.58s ) , suggesting that bolt had improved his performance .",
    "however , the runners in berlin benefited from a 0.9 m/s tailwind that , as we will show , can not be neglected .    in this paper",
    "we analyze bolt s records in beijing and berlin using a function proposed by tibshirani@xcite to describe the time dependence of the velocity in both races .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . as a first step",
    ", we fit an empirical function , @xmath3 , to the data available from the international association of athletics federation.@xcite from this fit we can deduce the maximum acceleration , the maximum power , and the total mechanical energy produced by the runner .",
    "we then compare bolt s performances in berlin 2009 and beijing 2008 , concluding that all of these values were smaller in 2009 than in 2008 .",
    "in a seminal paper , keller@xcite analyzed the problem faced by runners ",
    "how should they vary their velocity to minimize the time to run a certain distance ? in ref .",
    "the resistance of the air was assumed to be proportional to the velocity and , for the 100 m sprint , it was assumed that the best strategy is to apply as much constant force , @xmath4 , as possible .",
    "the equation of motion was written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the speed of the runner .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "is @xmath7 .",
    "although this solution seems to answer the proposed question , it has some limitations .",
    "one problem is that the air flow is turbulent , not laminar , and thus the drag force is proportional to @xmath8 , rather than @xmath6 .",
    "another problem is that runners must produce energy ( and thus a force ) to replace the energy expended by the vertical movement of the runners center of mass and the loss of energy due to the movement of their legs and feet .",
    "( see ref .   for an analysis of the energy cost of the vertical movement in a horse race . ) also , the runners velocity declines slightly close to the end of the 100 m race , which is not taken into account in eq .",
    "( [ keller ] ) .",
    "tibshirani@xcite proposed that a runner s force decreases with time according to @xmath9 , so that the solution of newton s second law is @xmath10 this solution solves some of the limitations discussed in the previous paragraph , but it is still incomplete . as we know , the air resistance is proportional to @xmath8 , but in the above models the air resistance was supposed to be proportional only to @xmath6 , probably to simplify the dynamical equations such that an analytical solution could be obtained .",
    "the problem of determining the best form of the function to describe the time dependence of the velocity of a runner in the 100 m sprint was addressed in refs .  , but is still open .",
    "we fitted bolt s velocity in beijing 2008 and berlin 2009 using an equation with the same form as eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) , but with three parameters to be fitted to his position as a function of time .",
    "we assume that the velocity is given by @xmath11",
    "the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ xf ] ) were fitted using the least - squares method constrained such that @xmath15 m , where @xmath16 is the running time minus the ` reaction time ' ( the elapsed time between the sound of the starting pistol and the initiation of the run ) .",
    "the split times for each 10 m of bolt s race are reproduced in table  [ tab1 ] . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we also show the split times calculated using the parameters given in table  [ tab2 ] .    the data variances were estimated as follows .",
    "first , we assumed that the uncertainties of the split times are all equal .",
    "then , we estimated the variances by the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed split times and the calculated values divided by the number of degrees of freedom ( the number of data points minus the number of fitted parameters ) , @xmath17 , considering both the beijing and berlin data : @xmath18 the obtained result was @xmath19s .",
    "then , we generated 100 sets of split times by summing normally distributed random numbers centered at zero with standard deviation equal to 0.02s to the observed split times .",
    "for each simulation we fitted new values of the parameters .",
    "thus , we obtained 100 values for each parameter , both to the beijing and berlin competitions .",
    "the uncertainties of the fitted parameters were estimated by the standard deviation of the 100 fitted parameters .",
    "the uncertainties calculated by this procedure reflect the uncertainties of the measured split times , the rounding of the published data , and the inadequacy of the model function .",
    "bolt s velocities in beijing and berlin are shown in fig .",
    "in berlin we observe a smaller initial acceleration and a smaller velocity decrease at the end of the race compared to his performance in beijing . the mechanical power developed by bolt",
    "is given by @xmath20 where the parameter @xmath21 corresponds to the dissipated power due to drag and @xmath22 is the tailwind speed , which was zero in beijing and equal to 0.9 m/s in berlin . for @xmath23 , a typical value of the drag coefficient,@xcite @xmath24kg / m@xmath25 for the air density , and a cross section of @xmath26m@xmath0",
    ", we obtain @xmath27w/(m / s)@xmath25 .",
    "a constant power of 200w is estimated for the power expended due to the vertical movement of the bolt s center of mass.@xcite we used @xmath28 kg for his mass.@xcite the mechanical power generated by bolt is shown in fig .",
    "we see that the maximum power generated by bolt in berlin is smaller than the power he generated in beijing .",
    "table  [ tab3 ] shows bolt s maximum acceleration and power at beijing 2008 and at berlin 2009 calculated using the fitted function @xmath3 .",
    "we also show the total mechanical energy produced in both competitions , calculated from the time integral of @xmath29 . within the limitations of the model ,",
    "bolt s performance in beijing ( maximum force and power and the total energy ) is higher than in berlin .",
    "also the predictions in ref .",
    "seem to be vindicated .",
    "from eq .  ( [ vf ] ) we see that the velocity would become negative at times after the end of the race : @xmath30 and 6.5 minutes , for beijing and berlin , respectively .",
    "thus , the model is applicable to competitions of short duration , as can be observed by comparing the differences between the measured and fitted split times .",
    "the differences are very small and even in the worst cases ( 10 m and 90 m in the beijing olympic games ) the corresponding differences in the actual and calculated distances are not greater than 0.6 m .",
    "the quality of the model function can also be observed by comparing the reported maximum velocity of 12.27 m/s at 65.0 m in berlin with the result obtained from the fit equal to 11.92 m/s at 57.6 m .",
    "an important question related to short races is the effect of the air resistance on the running time.@xcite in our model the power produced by the runner [ see eq .",
    "( [ pf ] ) ] is used to accelerate the runner s body and to overcome air resistance ( there also is a constant power of 200w , a kind of `` parasitic power loss '' dominated by the up - down movement of the runner s center of mass ) .",
    "if the runner is assisted by a tailwind , we assume that all the power saved to overcome air resistance will be used to accelerate the runner s body . given this assumption ,",
    "we ask what would the beijing record have been for a 0.9 m/s tailwind ( the wind measurement on the day of the berlin race ) ?",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ pf ] ) and the same initial acceleration for bolt in beijing to deduce a new velocity profile in berlin .",
    "we find that the record at the beijing olympic games would have been reduced by 0.16s to 9.53s .",
    "also , without the tailwind in berlin and with the same power profile developed by the runner in this race , the time would increase by 0.16s .",
    "the currently accepted theoretical and experimental results for the wind effect on 100 m sprint times,@xcite gives a typical reduction of about 0.05s in the race time for a tailwind of 1 m/s .",
    "a possible cause of our overestimation of the wind effect is the value of the drag coefficient @xmath31 that we used .",
    "a smaller value of @xmath31 implies that the wind effect is less important and , thus , the power saved in the presence of a tailwind would imply a smaller gain of velocity and , consequently , time .",
    "for instance , if we used @xmath32w/(m / s)@xmath25 the time reduction would be @xmath33s in the 100 m sprint for a 0.9 m/s tailwind  close to the accepted value .",
    "nevertheless , we chose @xmath27w/(m / s)@xmath25 ( see the paragraph after eq .",
    "( [ pf ] ) ) , which agrees with the recommended @xmath31 values@xcite to estimate the energy and power produced by runners in the 100 m sprint .",
    "another possible origin for the discrepancy between our result for the wind effect and the literature is the force applied by the runner .",
    "we considered that the energy and the ground force applied by the runner can be deduced from the fitted position position versus time function .",
    "however , some workers prefer to formulate a model based on the applied forces ( see , for instance , refs .  ) .",
    "these authors usually obtain better agreement for the effects of wind as well as altitude in short races .",
