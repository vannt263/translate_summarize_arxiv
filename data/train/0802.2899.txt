    "the rapid serge of interest in nanoplasmonics@xcite in recent years owes largely to a broad variety of already demonstrated and projected applications in fields ranging from information processing@xcite and integrated optics,@xcite through single molecule spectroscopies@xcite and detection,@xcite to biosensing and medical diagnostics.@xcite underlying these applications is the ability of plasmonic materials composed of nanoparticles ( nps ) to strongly enhance and spatially focus an incident electromagnetic ( em ) field at resonant frequencies and to coherently transport light in space.@xcite an external em field tuned to a resonance frequency , excites collective oscillations of conductive electrons in the skin - layer of particles .",
    "such coherent oscillations , termed localized surface plasmons , are confined within a small volume and hence give rise to substantial enhancement of the total field on the surface of the np . in an array of metal nps ,",
    "the surface plasmon resonance enhances the interaction between adjacent particles and may thus give rise to collective response to external light , where near - field coupling between closely spaced particles sets up coupled plasmon modes .",
    "it has been realized that the optical properties of metal nps and their arrays depend sensitively on their size , shape and relative arrangement as well as on the fine details of their material composition .",
    "together with the availability of advanced experimental methods for fabricating nanoconstructs with nanometer precision and regularity,@xcite this sensitivity calls for a numerical design tool that would be able to provide the precise structural details of a construct that will optimize a specific property ( or simultaneously optimize several properties ) , and hence provide a certain desired functionality .",
    "the potential of such a tool in nanophotonics research and technology goes beyond the availability of a method of determining ahead of experiment or simulation the structural parameters required for a specific functionality and hence circumventing an expensive and inevitably incomplete trial and error procedure . with proper construction ,",
    "such design tool provides also a route to material properties and new insights regarding plasmon wave propagation and the interaction of near fields with matter .",
    "such an approach was introduced in refs .",
    "[ ] , where the combination of genetic algorithms ( ga ) with a numerical solution of the maxwell equations was proposed as a stable design tool for nanoplasmonics .",
    "the approach was tested by application to simple 2d test models , leading to interesting new insights regarding the role of coherence , the potential of the source polarization and the time evolution of plasmon waves via composite constructs .",
    "experimental techniques capable of taking a numerically designed nanoconstruct and reproducing it in the laboratory are rapidly developing .",
    "in addition to the ( now considered `` traditional '' , but yet surprisingly powerful ) chemical and electron beam lithography approaches , advanced methods such as the focused ion beam and the atomic force microscope are becoming available .",
    "it is thus relevant to test the ability of the ga - based approach to solve realistic design problems involving a large number of parameters .",
    "it is important also to understand the convergence properties of the approach and its mechanism of operation .",
    "further , perhaps the most important outcome of the studies of refs .",
    "[ ] is the realization that the polarization and phase properties of the incident light play a major role in nanoplasmonics , hence the potential of elliptically polarized sources whose polarization and phase are optimized via the ga for a specific purpose .",
    "related is the recently established ability of nanoconstructs to modify the polarization properties of the incident em field .",
    "although 2d models can be usefully applied to various design problems , use of polarization requires the application of the ga in full three dimensions .",
    "our goal in the present work is thus multifold .",
    "first , we apply the ga to a many parameter design problem , namely the auto - design of a lens with predetermined properties starting with an arbitrarily - shaped slab and subject to different constraints . here",
    "we explore the effects of symmetry breaking and the essential properties of the class of structures that are able to spatially localize light .",
    "next we explore the possibility of using the ga to design a construct that will modify the incident polarization in a pre - determined fashion . here",
    "we test the applicability of the algorithm in full three dimensions .",
    "the next section briefly reviews the theory and its numerical implementation and sec . [ results ] presents and discusses our results .",
    "we conclude this work in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] with an outlook for future research .",
    "the scattering of em radiation by metal nanostructures is studied using a finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) scheme@xcite to solve the maxwell equations , @xmath0where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the electric and magnetic components of the em field , @xmath3 is an effective dielectric permittivity , @xmath4 is the magnetic permeability , and @xmath5 denotes the current density.@xcite the constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 account for material dispersion in metallic regions of space , ziolkowski95 which is described in the present work within the drude model with a frequency - dependent dielectric constant given by , @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ drude model ] ) , @xmath9 is the infinite frequency limit of the dielectric permittivity of metal , @xmath10 is the bulk plasma frequency , and @xmath11 is the relaxation rate . in this work we consider silver structures with the parameters provided in ref .",
    "[ ] . in order to simulate open systems ,",
    "perfectly matched layer ( pml ) boundaries@xcite are implemented with the exponentially differenced equations@xcite and a thickness of @xmath12 spatial steps .",
    "the simulation of periodic constructs applies periodic boundary conditions in the lateral directions and pml boundaries in the direction perpendicular to the light propagation direction .    to conclude this section we briefly outline the implementation of the ga in the present research program and its application to the optimal design of nanoplasmonics .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "[ ] for a general review of the ga , and provide here only the details essential for understanding the results of the next section .",
    "gas form a class of search techniques inspired by the biological process of evolution by means of natural selection , which can be used as a numerical optimization tool .",
    "the stochastic nature of the ga makes it a numerically stable optimizer , but is also the reason for which it requires a large number of evaluations in order to find a global extremum . in the present context",
    "the evaluation is computationally expensive but lends itself to efficient parallelization .",
    "it is thus practical while nontrivial .    within the genetic algorithm approach , we consider , in the plasmonics context , a general nano - construct composed of metallo - dielectric nps , the optical properties of which depend on a set of adjustable parameters .",
    "these include in general both field parameters ( such as the laser pulse duration , wavelength , polarization , and pulse shape ) and material parameters ( including the size , shape , and relative arrangement of individual nps ) .",
    "the standard ga procedure involves the following steps :    1 .",
    "start by generating a set ( population ) of possible solutions and evaluate the fitness function of each member of the set , where the fitness function is a time - averaged em energy , for instance .",
    "2 .   select pairs of solutions ( `` parents '' ) from the current set , with the probability of a given solution being selected made proportional to that solution s fitness .",
    "3 .   breed the two solutions selected in ( 2 ) and produce two new solutions ( `` offspring '' , or `` a new generation '' ) .",
    "4 .   repeat steps ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) until the number of new solutions produced equals the number of individuals in the current set .",
    "use the new set to replace the old one and repeat steps ( 1 ) through ( 5 ) until a ( problem - dependent ) termination criterion is satisfied .",
    "each individual is encoded by one additional numerical parameter , the number of significant digits , referred to as the number of genes .",
    "all simulations have been performed on ibm bluegene / l cluster at argonne national laboratory .",
    "we begin ( sec . [ lens ] ) by discussing the design of a nanoscale silver lens using two dimensional ga optimizations . in sec .",
    "[ cross ] we illustrate the design of a construct that modifies the polarization of an incident field in a predetermined fashion using a 3d implementation of the ga approach .      our objective in this subsection is to design an optimally shaped np that would focus an incident plane wave onto a pre - specified detection point .",
    "strong enhancement and focussing of the em energy on the surface of the construct is guaranteed essentially independent of the design , but our goal here is to design a true lens , that is , to focus the light onto a specific but arbitrary point remote from the construct .",
    "ga optimization to that end is carried out in 2d , were attention is restricted to the transverse - electric mode te with two electric , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and one magnetic , @xmath15 , field components .",
    "we consider em wave scattering by a single silver np of an arbitrary shape , as schematically depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig1]a and [ fig1]b . the incident plane wave propagates from left to right and",
    "is polarized along the vertical axis .",
    "as the fitness function in the ga optimizations we use the time - averaged em energy at the detection point , normalized with respect to the incident em energy .",
    "since a single evaluation of the fitness function in two dimensions is relatively fast , we employ a different approach from that used in refs .",
    "[ ] , using a single processor to evaluate a single individual in the current generation .",
    "the overall number of individuals in the ga optimizations is @xmath16 , which results in rapid convergence , as illustrated below .",
    "we consider two qualitatively different cases , a lens that is constrained to be symmetric with respect to the plane perpendicular to the light propagation vector , fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , and one where the algorithm is free to break this symmetry , fig .",
    "the symmetric lens is a polygon consisting of @xmath17 vertices .",
    "the positions of @xmath18 of the vertices serve as parameters in the ga optimization .",
    "the @xmath19 ( vertical ) coordinate is spaced in regular intervals of @xmath20 nm and the @xmath21 ( horizontal ) coordinate is a free parameter , restricted to the @xmath22 to @xmath23 nm range ( mapped to a grid with a spatial step of @xmath24 nm ) .",
    "the positions of @xmath18 other vertices are determined by reflecting the first @xmath18 vertices about the vertical plane shown in red in fig .",
    "the remaining @xmath25 vertices are determined by reflecting the resulting @xmath26 vertices about the plane intersecting the bottom two vertices ( the bottom two are reflected onto themselves ) .",
    "the total number of parameters in the ga optimizations is @xmath27 , including the @xmath28 structural parameters and the incident wavelength , @xmath29 , which is restricted to the @xmath30 nm range .",
    "the shape of the asymmetric lens depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b is a polygon consisting of the same number of vertices as in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a . in this case , however , we allow @xmath26 vertices to vary independently on both sides of the vertical red line bisecting the np .",
    "this results in @xmath26 structural parameters and , as in the case of the symmetric lens , the incident wavelength is determined as one additional independent parameter .",
    "the incident pulse is of the form , @xmath31where @xmath32 is the pulse duration , @xmath33 is the speed of light in vacuum , and @xmath29 is the incident wavelength . throughout this subsection",
    "we take @xmath34 fs with a total propagation time of @xmath35 fs , which ensures that all plasmon polariton waves excited by the incident pulse decay within a single fdtd run .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] presents the optimization results .",
    "the main panel illustrates the convergence of the ga iterations and the insets show the optimal lenses .",
    "it is remarked that both the symmetric and the asymmetric constructs tend to minimize the thickness of the central slab , suggesting , at first sight , that a dimeric construct would be the best light localizer . for em enhancement near the surface of the metal",
    "construct , dimeric configurations are expected , and were previously found,@xcite to optimize the enhancement . in the case of a true lens , however , where the focus is arbitrary and pre - specified , the dimeric construct is not the optimal solution . in studies of the symmetric lens we found that the ga converges to the structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a whether or not the thickness of the central slab is lower bounded . the thin wire joining the top and bottom portions of the lens plays an essential role in the light focussing dynamics . in simulations of the steady - state distributions of the currents through the constructs",
    ", we found that the symmetric lens central slab supports strong current flow in the vertical direction bouncing back and forth between upper and lower parts of the lens .",
    "the importance of the slab is also confirmed by independent simulations , in which we artificially remove the slab from the lens .",
    "the enhancement factor in this case is noticeably lower as compared to the ga optimized np .",
    "interestingly , the optimal shapes obtained differ significantly for the symmetric ( left inset of fig . [ fig2 ] ) and",
    "asymmetric ( right inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) cases .",
    "the two constructs differ also in their focussing mechanism .",
    "the symmetric lens represents an analog of the dipole antenna that was proven to efficiently enhance em radiation at its center of symmetry.@xcite the asymmetric lens applies a more complex approach to optimizing the enhancement and spatial localization of the light , utilizing to that end , as discussed below , the long peaks marked in the vicinity of the detection point and the two narrow summits at the top and bottom of the lens .",
    "the use of a large number of parameters gives rise to rapid convergence of the ga optimizations as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , where we follow the evolution of one of the structural parameters ( normalized to range from 0 to 1 ) as the optimization progresses . at the start of the iterations ( from generation @xmath24 to about @xmath36 ) we observe large variations in the value of the parameter among individuals of the same generation .",
    "as the ga converges , however , the best solutions tend to have similar values for this particular parameter .",
    "this means that individuals with this value are more likely to be explored , resulting in an increase in the number of individuals with similar values for this parameter as the ga progresses . at this point",
    "the major structural features are defined , and only minor corrections are made to reach an optimal solution .",
    "the optimal value of the parameter considered is attained in less than @xmath37 generations . to verify that the algorithm converges to the global extremum of the fitness function , we performed calculations of the enhancement at the detection point for the optimal symmetric and asymmetric lenses as a function of the incident wavelength , @xmath38 .",
    "the results of these simulations , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , show well defined extrema at the wavelengths to which the ga optimizations converged .",
    "the physics underlying the optimally designed plasmonic lenses can be understood by calculation of the steady - state em fields obtained via the phasor function formalism ( see , for instance , chapter 8 of ref .",
    "[ ] ) . the spatial distribution of the steady - state em energy shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a for the symmetric lens confirms that the optimal symmetric lens enhances the em radiation at the detection point as a nanoscale dipole antenna . a qualitative difference from the latter , however , is the thin central slab , which , as discussed above plays an important role in the focussing design .",
    "the asymmetric lens of fig .",
    "[ fig4]b , by contrast , applies a more complex strategy .",
    "studies of the time evolution of the em intensity through the construct ( see the upload - able animationsmovie for illustration of the em field focusing by the asymmetric lens ) illustrate that the incident radiation at the optimal frequency first excites surface waves at the input ( left ) side of the lens and next , due to the thin core , passes through the structure in the vicinity of its center .",
    "the thin core strongly couples the plasmon waves on both sides of the lens .",
    "by contrast to the dipole antenna , however , the asymmetric lens is concave at the input side ( feature @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) , which serves to enhance the em radiation at the center .",
    "the incident field also excites localized plasmon waves that travel around the lens and are accumulated at the sharp corners marked by @xmath39 .",
    "finally , the two well pronounced peaks indicated as @xmath40 in fig . [ fig4]b act on the one hand as a cavity to eliminate loss of the em radiation passed through . on the other hand , they are strongly em coupled to the spikes marked @xmath39 .",
    "we tested the importance of the feature @xmath39 by removing it from the optimal lens , finding , by recalculation of the enhancement , a factor of @xmath41 lower enhancement at the focus .",
    "this subsection is motivated in part by recent studies,@xcite in which it was demonstrated that single l - shaped silver nps and arrays thereof exhibit strong birefringence , with important applications in optics.@xcite as discussed in sec .",
    "[ introduction ] , polarization effects requires 3d simulations .",
    "the combination of the ga with fdtd in full 3d , however , present a numerical challenge since 3d fdtd calculations are numerically costly . in this subsection",
    "we follow the optimization approach developed for nanoplasmonics in ref . [ ] . here",
    "an individual is evaluated by partitioning the fdtd grid onto @xmath42 processors and implementing point - to - point communication mpi subroutines as discussed in ref . [ ] .",
    "average execution time of ga iterations for @xmath43 generations is nearly @xmath44 days .",
    "we consider a periodic array of @xmath45-shaped silver nps , as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which is irradiated by an @xmath21-polarized incident plane wave propagating along the @xmath46-axis .",
    "the target of the optimization is to enhance the birefringence of the periodic array , i.e. , to maximize the ratio of the time averaged em energy in the field component perpendicular to the incident field polarization , @xmath47 , to the corresponding energy in the field component parallel to the incidence polarization , @xmath48 . as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the free parameters are the lengths of the four arms of the np , @xmath49 , the angle of rotation , @xmath50 , and the incident wavelength , @xmath29 .",
    "the number of individuals in each generation is @xmath51 and the incident pulse duration is @xmath52 fs , with a total propagation of @xmath53 fs .",
    "the height and the thickness of all arms of the np are @xmath54 nm . the ratio @xmath55 is averaged over an @xmath56-plane parallel to the array plane on the output side at a distance of @xmath57 nm from the array .",
    "the limit of @xmath58 corresponds to poor or no birefringence , whereas @xmath59 corresponds to equal magnitudes of the incident polarization and the field component that is purely induced by the array .",
    "the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] presents the evolution of the ratio , @xmath60 , with the number of ga generations and the inset shows the optimized unit cell of the array after @xmath61 generations .",
    "we have that for the incident pulse duration considered , the optimized ratio exceeds @xmath62 , corresponding to strong depolarization of the em field by the array .",
    "since the enhanced birefringence relies on resonant excitation of localized plasmon waves , increase of the incident pulse duration at the optimal wavelength is expected to further increase the @xmath55 ratio .",
    "we confirmed this expectation by calculating the birefringence ratio as a function of the incident wavelength for the geometry to which the ga converged and found that @xmath63 for laser pulses with durations @xmath64 fs or longer .",
    "we remark that the optimal incident wavelength ( the wavelength to which the algorithm converged ) , @xmath65 nm , corresponds to the global maximum of @xmath55 , as in the case of two dimensional simulations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4]b and the corresponding discussion ) .",
    "the optimally designed array gives rise to complex em field dynamics , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where we plot the steady - state solutions of the maxwell equations on the output side of the array at a distance of @xmath44 nm .",
    "it is clearly seen that the induced polarization component depends markedly on the distance from the array and is particularly strong at short distances . the induced @xmath66 component ( @xmath46 with respect to the reference frame of the incident @xmath67-vector ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6]c , corresponds to redirection of the scattered field by the array and rapidly decays with distance from it .",
    "simulations of the em eigenmodes of the array ( not shown ) reveal the origin of the strong birefringence found . at the resonant wavelength ,",
    "the total field is determined by the field induced collective oscillations of the electrons confined in the particles , which in turn is largely determined by the polarizability tensor of the particle , hence its shape and orientation with respect to the direction of incidence .",
    "an interesting observation is the large relative phase , @xmath68 , between @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the far field region .",
    "the phase along with the ratio @xmath55 fully defines the polarization of the scattered em field . for the optimal parameters the phase , @xmath68 , approaches @xmath69 at a distance of @xmath57 nm on the output side of the array and is almost independent of @xmath21 and @xmath19 .",
    "it is instructive to re - express the polarization of the scattered field in terms of stokes parameters , defined as@xcite@xmath70where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the steady - state solutions of the maxwell equations for the optimal array . whereas the incoming incident field is described by the stokes parameters @xmath71 , the strong depolarization induced by the array results in @xmath72 , corresponding to left elliptical polarization .",
    "we remark the symmetry breaking between the left and right polarized components of the incident ( linearly - polarized ) light that is induced by the chirality of the system .",
    "our goal in the work discussed in the previous sections has been to extend and apply a recently developedsukharevnanolett06,sukharevprb07 approach for optimal design of plasmonic nanoconstructs , both as a route to new insights into plasmonic physics and as a practical tool for fabrication of optical nanodevices with desired functionalities . to that end",
    "we introduced multi - parameter ga optimizations in both two and three dimensions .    using fast fdtd algorithms",
    ", we first applied the ga to the problem of focusing of em radiation by subwavelength scaled silver lenses .",
    "we found that symmetry plays a major role in light focusing and directing in the nanoscale .",
    "the detailed mechanisms by which a lens constrained to be symmetric and one allowed to assume asymmetry guide the em field in space were explored and the role of coherence was noted .",
    "ga optimizations were next applied to three - dimensional periodic plasmonic systems to manipulate the polarization of the em field . the ability of properly structured but rather simple cross - shaped silver nps to convert a linearly polarized field into left or right elliptically polarized field with comparable x- and y - components was illustrated .",
    "a variety of potential extensions and applications of the numerical tool developed above can be envisioned .",
    "one of the goals of our current research is to develop nanoscale light sources with desired phase and polarization properties that would allow the extension of coherent control to the nanodomain .",
    "another is the numerical design of functional plasmonic nanodevices where the structural parameters of the material system have been optimized to yield a specific function .",
