    "it has become clear in the past several years that copper oxide materials are among the most complex systems studied in condensed matter physics , and show many unusual normal - state properties .",
    "the complications arise mainly from ( 1 ) strong anisotropy in the properties parallel and perpendicular to the cuo@xmath0 planes which are the key structural element in the whole copper oxide superconducting materials , and ( 2 ) extreme sensitivity of the properties to the compositions ( stoichiometry ) which control the carrier density in the cuo@xmath0 plane @xcite , while the unusual normal - state feature is then closely related to the fact that these copper oxide materials are doped mott insulators , obtained by chemically adding charge carriers to a strongly correlated antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulating state , therefore the physical properties of these systems mainly depend on the extent of dopings , and the regimes have been classified into the underdoped , optimally doped , and overdoped , respectively @xcite .",
    "the normal - state properties of copper oxide materials in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes exhibit a number of anomalous properties in the sense that they do not fit in the conventional fermi - liquid theory @xcite , and the mechanism for the superconductivity in copper oxide materials has been widely recognized to be closely associated with the anisotropic normal - state properties @xcite . among the striking features of the normal - state properties in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes , the physical quantity which most evidently displays the anisotropic property in copper oxide materials is the charge dynamics @xcite , which is manifested by the optical conductivity and resistivity .",
    "it has been show from the experiments that the in - plane charge dynamics is rather universal within the whole copper oxide materials @xcite .",
    "the in - plane optical conductivity for the same doping is nearly materials independent both in the magnitude and energy dependence , and shows the non - drude behavior at low energies and anomalous midinfrared band in the charge - transfer gap , while the in - plane resistivity @xmath1 exhibits a linear behavior in the temperature in the optimally doped regime and a nearly temperature linear dependence with deviations at low temperatures in the underdoped regime @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the magnitude of the c - axis charge dynamics in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes is strongly materials dependent , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is dependent on the species of the building blocks in between the cuo@xmath0 planes @xcite . in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes ,",
    "the experimental results @xcite show that the ratio @xmath2 ranges from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , this large magnitude of the resistivity anisotropy reflects that the c - axis mean free path is shorter than the interlayer distance , and the carriers are tightly confined to the cuo@xmath0 planes , and also is the evidence of the incoherent charge dynamics in the c - axis direction . for the copper oxide materials without the cu - o chains in between the cuo@xmath0 planes",
    "@xcite , such as la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 systems , the transferred weight in the c - axis conductivity forms a band peaked at high energy @xmath8 , and the low - energy spectral weight is quite small and spread over a wide energy range instead of forming a peak at low energies , in this case the behavior of the c - axis temperature dependent resistivity @xmath9 is characterized by a crossover from the high temperature metallic - like to the low temperature semiconducting - like @xcite .",
    "however , for these copper oxide materials with the cu - o chains in between the cuo@xmath0 planes @xcite , such as yba@xmath0cu@xmath10o@xmath11 systems , the c - axis conductivity exhibits the non - drude behavior at low energies and weak midinfrared band , moreover , this weak midinfrared band rapidly decrease with reducing dopings or increasing temperatures , while the c - axis resistivity @xmath9 is linear in temperatures in the optimally doped regime , and shows a crossover from the high temperature metallic - like behavior to the low temperature semiconducting - like behavior in the underdoped regime @xcite .",
    "therefore there are some subtle differences between the chain and no - chain copper oxide materials .",
    "the c - axis charge dynamics of copper oxide materials has been addressed from several theoretical viewpoints @xcite .",
    "based on the concept of dynamical dephasing , leggett @xcite thus proposed that the c - axis conduction has to do with scatterings from in - plane thermal fluctuations , and depends on the ratio of the interlayer hopping rate of cuo@xmath0 sheets to the thermal energy . while the theory of tunneling c - axis conductivity in the incoherent regime has been given by many researchers @xcite .",
    "based on a highly anisotropic fermi - liquid , some effect from the interlayer static disorder or dynamical one has been discussed @xcite .",
    "the similar incoherent conductivity in the coupled fermion chains has been in more detail studied by many authors within the framework of the non - fermi - liquid theory @xcite . moreover",
    ", the most reliable result for the c - axis charge dynamics from the model relevant to copper oxide materials has been obtained by the numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the in - plane resistivity deviates from the temperature linear behavior and temperature coefficient of the c - axis resistivity change sign , showing semiconducting - like behavior at low temperatures are associated with the effect of the pseudogap @xcite . to shed light on this issue",
    ", we , in this paper , apply the fermion - spin approach @xcite to study the c - axis charge dynamics by considering the interlayer coupling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical framework is presented in sec .",
    "ii . in the case of the incoherent interlayer hopping , the c - axis current - current correlation function ( then the c - axis optical conductivity )",
    "is calculated in terms of the in - plane single - particle spectral function by using standard formalisms for the tunneling in metal - insulator - metal junctions @xcite . within this theoretical framework",
    ", we discuss the c - axis charge dynamics of the chain copper oxide materials in sec .",
    "it is shown that the c - axis charge dynamics of the chain copper oxide materials is mainly governed by the scattering from in - plane charged holons due to spinon fluctuations , and the behavior of the c - axis resistivity is the metallic - like in the optimally doped regime and the semiconducting - like in the underdoped regime at low temperatures . in sec .",
    "iv , the c - axis charge dynamics of the no - chain copper oxide materials is discussed .",
    "our result shows that the scattering from the in - plane fluctuation incorporating with the interlayer disorder dominates the c - axis charge dynamics for the no - chain copper oxide materials . in this case",
    ", the c - axis resistivity exhibits the semiconducting - like behavior in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes at low temperatures .",
    "v is devoted to a summary and discussions .",
    "our results also show that the crossover to the semiconducting - like range in @xmath9 is obviously linked with the crossover from the temperature linear to the nonlinear range in @xmath1 , and the common origin for these crossovers is due to the existence of the holon pseudogap at low temperatures and lower doping levels .",
    "among the microscopic models the most simplest for the discussion of doped mott insulators is the @xmath12-@xmath13 model @xcite , which is originally introduced as an effective hamiltonian of the hubbard model in the strong coupling regime , where the electron become strongly correlated to avoid the double occupancy .",
    "the interest in the @xmath12-@xmath13 model is stimulated by many researchers suggestions that it may contain the essential physics of copper oxide materials @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there is a lot of evidence from the experiments and numerical simulations in favour of the @xmath12-@xmath13 model as the basic underlying microscopic model @xcite . within each cuo@xmath0 plane",
    ", the physics property may be described by the two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath12-@xmath13 model , @xmath14 supplemented by the on - site local constraint @xmath15 to avoid the double occupancy , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the lattice constant of the square planar lattice , which is set as the unit hereafter , @xmath18 refers to planar sites within the l - th cuo@xmath0 plane , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) are the electron creation ( annihilation ) operators , @xmath21 are the spin operators with @xmath22 as the pauli matrices , and @xmath23 is the chemical potential .",
    "then the hopping between cuo@xmath0 planes is considered as @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the interlayer distance , and has been determined from the experiments @xcite as @xmath27 . as mentioned above , the experimental results show that the c - axis charge dynamics in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes is incoherent , therefore the c - axis momentum can not be defined @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the absence of the coherent c - axis charge dynamics is a consequence of the weak interlayer hopping matrix element @xmath28 , but also of a strong intralayer scattering , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath29 , and therefore the common cuo@xmath0 planes in copper oxide materials clearly dominate the most normal - state properties . in this case ,",
    "the most relevant for the study of the c - axis charge dynamics is the results on the in - plane conductivity @xmath30 and related single - particle spectral function @xmath31 .",
    "since the strong electron correlation in the @xmath12-@xmath13 model manifests itself by the electron single occupancy on - site local constraint , then the crucial requirement is to impose this electron on - site local constraint for a proper understanding of the physics of copper oxide materials . to incorporate this local constraint ,",
    "the fermion - spin theory based on the charge - spin separation has been proposed @xcite . according to the fermion - spin theory ,",
    "the constrained electron operators in the @xmath12-@xmath13 model is decomposed as @xcite , @xmath32 with the spinless fermion operator @xmath33 keeps track of the charge ( holon ) , while the pseudospin operator @xmath34 keeps track of the spin ( spinon ) .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that the electron on - site local constraint can be treated exactly in analytical calculations . in this case , the low - energy behavior of the @xmath12-@xmath13 model ( 2 ) in the fermion - spin representation can be written as @xcite ,    @xmath35    where @xmath36 $ ] , the in - plane holon particle - hole parameter @xmath37 , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the pseudospin raising and lowering operators , respectively . as a consequence , the kinetic part in the @xmath12-@xmath13 model has been expressed as the holon - spinon interaction in the fermion - spin representation , which dominates the charge and spin dynamics in copper oxide materials in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes .",
    "the spinon and holon may be separated at the mean - field level , but they are strongly coupled beyond mean - field approximation ( mfa ) due to fluctuations .",
    "the mean - field theory within the fermion - spin formalism in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes without af long - range - order ( aflro ) has been developed @xcite , and the in - plane mean - field spinon and holon green s functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 have been evaluated @xcite as , @xmath42 @xmath43 respectively , where @xmath44 $ ] , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the number of the nearest neighbor sites at the plane , while the in - plane mean - field spinon spectrum @xmath49-[\\alpha c_{z}+{1\\over 4z}(1-\\alpha)]\\right ) ( \\epsilon\\gamma_{k}-1 ) \\nonumber \\\\",

    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "in order not to violate the sum rule of the correlation function @xmath55 in the case without aflro , the important decoupling parameter @xmath56 has been introduced in the mean - field calculation @xcite , which can be regarded as the vertex correction .",
    "the mean - field order parameter @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and chemical potential @xmath23 have been determined @xcite by the self - consistent equations .    within the 2d @xmath12-@xmath13 model ,",
    "the in - plane charge dynamics in copper oxide materials has been discussed @xcite by considering fluctuations around this mean - field solution , and the result exhibits a behavior similar to that seen in the experiments @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite . in the framework of the charge - spin separation , an electron",
    "is represented by the product of a holon and a spinon , then the external field can only be coupled to one of them . according to the ioffe - larkin combination rule @xcite ,",
    "the physical c - axis conductivity @xmath62 is given by , @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the contributions to the c - axis conductivity from holons and spinons , respectively , and can be expressed @xcite as , @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the holon and spinon c - axis current - current correlation function , respectively , which are defined as , @xmath69 within the hamiltonian ( 4 ) , the c - axis current densities of spinons and holons are obtained by the time derivation of the polarization operator using heisenberg s equation of motion as , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively , with @xmath72 is the effective interlayer holon hopping matrix element , and the order parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 are defined @xcite as @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , respectively . as in the previous discussions @xcite ,",
    "a formal calculation for the spinon part shows that there is no the direct contribution to the current - current correlation from spinons , but the strongly correlation between holons and spinons is considered through the spinon s order parameters entering in the holon part of the contribution to the current - current correlation , therefore the charge dynamics in copper oxide materials is mainly caused by charged holons within the cuo@xmath0 planes , which are strongly renormalized because of the strong interaction with fluctuations of surrounding spinon excitations .    in the case of the incoherent charge dynamics in the c - axis direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , the independent electron propagation in each layer , the c - axis holon current - current correlation function is then proportional to the tunneling rate between just two adjacent planes , and can be calculated in terms of the in - plane holon green s function @xmath77 by using standard formalisms for the tunneling in metal - insulator - metal junctions @xcite as , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the matsubara frequency .",
    "therefore the c - axis current - current correlation function is essentially determined by the property of the in - plane full holon propagator @xmath80 , which can be expressed as , @xmath81 where the holon self - energy has been obtained by considering the second - order correction due to the spinon pair bubble as @xcite , @xmath82-n_{b}(\\omega_{p+p ' } ) n_{b}(-\\omega_{p'})\\over i\\omega_{n}+\\omega_{p+p'}-\\omega_{p'}- \\xi_{p+k } } \\right .",

    "green s function @xmath80 also can be expressed as frequency integrals in terms of the spectral representation as , @xmath85 with the in - plane holon spectral function @xmath86 .",
    "then the c - axis optical conductivity in the present theoretical framework is expressed @xcite as @xmath87 .",
    "we firstly consider the chain copper oxide materials . from the experiments testing the c - axis charge dynamics @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the presence of the rather conductive cu - o chains in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes can reduce the blocking effect , and therefore the c - axis charge dynamics in this system is effected by the same electron interaction as that in the in - plane . in this case , we substitute eq .",
    "( 14 ) into eq .",

    ", we find that there is two bands in @xmath62 separated at @xmath98 , the higher - energy band , corresponding to the `` midinfrared band '' in the in - plane optical conductivity @xmath30 @xcite , shows a broad peak at @xmath99 , in particular , the weight of this band is strongly doping dependent , and decreasing rapidly with dopings , but the peak position does not appreciably shift to higher energies . on the other hand ,",
    "the transferred weight of the lower - energy band forms a sharp peak at @xmath100 , which can be described formally by the non - drude formula , and our analysis indicates that this peak decay is @xmath101 at low energies as in the case of @xmath30 @xcite . in comparison with @xmath30 @xcite , the present result also shows that the values of @xmath89 are by @xmath102 orders of magnitude smaller than those of @xmath30 in the corresponding energy range .",
    "the finite temperature behavior of @xmath89 also has been discussed , and the result shows that @xmath89 is temperature dependent , the higher - energy band is severely suppressed with increasing temperatures , and vanishes at higher temperatures .",
    "these results are qualitatively consistent with the experimental results @xcite of the chain copper oxide materials and numerical simulations @xcite .    with the help of the c - axis conductivity",
    ", the c - axis resistivity can be obtained as @xmath103 , and the numerical result at the doping @xmath90 and @xmath92 for the parameters @xmath93 , @xmath104 , and @xmath95 is shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) and fig .",
    "2(b ) , respectively . in the underdoped regime ,",
    "the behavior of the temperature dependence of @xmath9 shows a crossover from the high temperature metallic - like ( @xmath105 ) to the low temperature semiconducting - like ( @xmath106 ) , but the metallic - like temperature dependence dominates over a wide temperature range .",
    "therefore in this case , there is a general trend that the chain copper oxide materials show nonmetallic @xmath9 in the underdoped regime at low temperatures . while in the optimally doped regime , @xmath9 is linear in temperatures , and shows the metallic - like behavior for all temperatures .",
    "these results are also qualitatively consistent with the experimental results of the chain copper oxide materials @xcite and numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "now we turn to discuss the c - axis charge dynamics of the no - chain copper oxide materials .",
    "it has been indicated from the experiments @xcite that for the no - chain copper oxide materials the doped holes may introduce a disorder in between the cuo@xmath0 planes , contrary to the case of the chain copper oxide materials @xcite , where the increasing doping reduces the disorder in between the cuo@xmath0 planes due to the effect of the cu - o chains . therefore for the no - chain copper oxide materials , the disorder introduced by doped holes residing between the cuo@xmath0 planes modifies the interlayer hopping elements as the random matrix elements . in this case ,",
    "only the in - plane holon density of states ( dos ) @xmath107 enters the holon current - current correlation function as in disordered systems @xcite , and after a similar discussion as in sec .",
    "ii , we find that the corresponding momentum - nonconserving expression of the c - axis conductivity @xmath108 for the no - chain copper oxide materials is obtained by the replacement of the in - plane holon spectral function @xmath109 in eq .",

    "this result shows that the c - axis conductivity @xmath108 contains two bands , the higher - energy band , corresponding to the midinfrared band in the in - plane conductivity @xmath30 @xcite , shows a broad peak at @xmath119 .",
    "the weight of this band is increased with dopings , but the peak position does not appreciably shift to lower energies . as a consequence of this pinning of the transferred spectral weight ,",
    "the weight of the lower - energy band , corresponding to the non - drude peak in @xmath30 @xcite , is quite small and does not form a well - defined peak at low energies in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes . in this case , the conductivity @xmath108 at low energies can not be described by the over - damped drude - like formula even an @xmath120-dependence of the in - plane holon scattering rate has been taken into consideration . in comparison with the momentum - conserving @xmath89 , our result also shows that at low energies the suppression of the momentum - nonconserving @xmath114 is due to the disordered effect introduced by doped holes residing between the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "these results are qualitatively consistent with the experimental results of the no - chain copper oxide materials @xcite .    for the further understanding the transport property of the no - chain copper oxide materials ,",
    "we have also performed the numerical calculation for the c - axis resistivity @xmath121 , and the results at the doping @xmath115 and @xmath92 for the parameters @xmath93 , @xmath117 , and @xmath122 are shown in fig .",

    "4(b ) , respectively . in accordance with the c - axis conductivity @xmath108 ,",

    "in the above discussions , the central concerns of the c - axis charge dynamics in copper oxide materials are the two dimensionality of the electron state and incoherent hopping between the cuo@xmath0 planes , and therefore the c - axis charge dynamics in the present fermion - spin picture based on the charge - spin separation is mainly determined by the in - plane charged holon fluctuation for the chain copper oxide materials and the in - plane charged holon fluctuation incorporating with the interlayer disorder for the no - chain copper oxide materials . in comparison with the in - plane resistivity @xmath1 @xcite",

    "are separated as the holon and spinon , respectively .",
    "although both holons and spinons contributed to the charge and spin dynamics , it has been shown that the scattering of spinons dominates the spin dynamics @xcite , while the results of the in - plane charge dynamics @xcite and present c - axis charge dynamics show that scattering of holons dominates the charge dynamics , the two rates observed in the experiments @xcite are attributed to the scattering of two distinct excitations , spinons and holons .",
    "it has been shown that an remarkable point of the pseudogap is that it appears in both of spinon and holon excitations @xcite .",
    "the present study indicates that the observed crossovers of @xmath125 and @xmath126 for copper oxide materials seem to be connected with the pseudogap in the in - plane charge holon excitations , which can be understood from the physical property of the in - plane holon dos .",
    "the numerical result of the in - plane holon dos @xmath110 at the doping @xmath92 , @xmath90 , and @xmath127 for the parameter @xmath93 at the temperature @xmath96=0 is shown in fig .",

    "while the in - plane holon density of states @xmath110 in the underdoping @xmath92 as a function of energy for the temperature ( a ) @xmath118 , ( b ) @xmath128 , and ( c ) @xmath129 is plotted in fig .",
    "6 . from fig . 5 and fig . 6",
    ", we therefore find that the in - plane holon dos in mfa consists of the central part only , which comes from the noninteracting particles as pointed in ref .",
    "@xcite . after including fluctuations",
    "the central part is renormalized and two side bands @xcite and a v - shape holon pseudogap near the chemical potential @xmath23 in the underdoped regime appear .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath131 , in this case the magnetic fluctuation is strong enough to lead to the holon pseudogap",
    ". this holon pseudogap would reduce the in - plane holon scattering and thus is responsible for the metallic to semiconducting crossover in the c - axis resistivity @xmath126 and the deviation from the temperature linear behavior in the in - plane resistivity @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "this holon pseudogap will also lead to form the normal - state gap in the system , and the similar result has been obtained from the doped _",
