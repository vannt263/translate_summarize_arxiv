    "these luminous quasars ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) were selected as @xmath12-dropout objects using optical colors ; follow - up near - infrared ( nir ) photometry and optical spectroscopy were used to distinguish against late - type dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "these quasars are fainter than @xmath14 , the magnitude selection limit that the sdss team used @xcite .",

    "based on the combination of this sample , the luminous quasar sample from @xmath9 deg@xmath2 of sdss , and the @xcite sample , we found a steep slope at the bright end of the quasar luminosity function ( qlf ) at @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we present the discovery of six new quasars in the sdss deep stripe .",
    "all six quasars are about one magnitude fainter than those reported in paper i , or two magnitudes fainter than the luminous sdss quasars . with these new quasars",
    ", we can measure the qlf over three magnitudes .",
    "the basic procedures of candidate selection , follow - up observations , and data reduction are similar to the procedures used in paper i.    the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly introduces the construction of the sdss co - added imaging data .",
    "section 3 describes our selection criteria and follow - up observations of quasar candidates .",
    "we present the six new quasars in section 4 and discuss the qlf at @xmath0 in section 5 .",
    "we summarize the paper in section 6 . throughout the paper",
    "we use a @xmath20-dominated flat cosmology with h@xmath21 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the sdss was an imaging and spectroscopic survey of the sky @xcite using a dedicated wide - field 2.5 m telescope @xcite at apache point observatory .",
    "imaging was carried out in drift - scan mode using a 142 mega - pixel camera @xcite which gathered data in five broad bands , @xmath25 , spanning the range from 3000 to 10,000   @xcite , on moonless photometric @xcite nights of good seeing .",
    "the effective exposure time was 54 s. the images were processed using specialized software @xcite , and were photometrically @xcite and astrometrically @xcite calibrated using observations of a set of primary standard stars @xcite on a neighboring 20-inch telescope .",
    "all magnitudes are roughly on an ab system @xcite , and use the asinh scale described by @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of the sdss imaging survey was to scan 8500 deg@xmath2 of the north galactic cap ( hereafter referred to as the sdss main survey ) .",
    "in addition to the main survey , sdss also conducted a deep survey by repeatedly imaging a 300 deg@xmath2 area on the celestial equator in the south galactic cap in the fall ( hereafter referred to as the sdss deep survey ; * ? ? ? * ) . this deep stripe ( also called stripe 82 ;",
    "see stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) spans @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the multi - epoch images , when coadded , allow the selection of much fainter quasars than the sdss main survey .",
    "we used the 10-run co - added data ( constructed in 2005 ) in paper i and found five @xmath0 quasars with @xmath19 in this area .",
    "the construction of the co - added images is close , but not identical , to that of annis et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , paper 1 , and @xcite .",
    "we used @xmath28 scans from the sdss deep southern stripe , restricting ourselves to fields with @xmath29-band seeing less than @xmath30 and @xmath29-band sky fainter than 19.5 mag / arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "because our selection algorithm uses only @xmath29 , @xmath12 , and @xmath31-band photometry , we did not co - add the @xmath32 and @xmath33-band data .",
    "the input images are the sdss corrected frames ( or _ fpc _ images ) .",
    "each input image was calibrated to a standard sdss zero point and weighted on a field - by - field basis with @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the transparency as measured by the relative zero point of the image , fwhm is the full width at half maximum of the psf , and @xmath36 is the variance of the sky .",
    "we did not use mask files in the weight map .",
    "after sky background was estimated and subtracted , the images were mapped onto a uniform rectangular output astrometric grid using a modified version of the registration software swarp @xcite .",
    "the weight maps were subjected to the same mapping .",
    "the final co - added images are about two magnitudes deeper than the sdss single - run data .",
    "the median seeing of the co - adds as measured in the @xmath31 band is @xmath37 .",
    "the co - added images included in the sdss dr7 @xcite were run through the sdss photometric pipeline photo . for a variety of technical reasons , we could not do the same for our co - added images , so we used sextractor @xcite instead of photo to do photometry . for each field , the photometry of the three ( @xmath38 ) co - added images includes the following steps .",
    "first we detected sources in the @xmath31-band image .",
    "we used aperture photometry with an aperture ( diameter ) size @xmath39 ( or 7.5 pixels ) , 2.5 times the typical psf fwhm .",
    "we then used sextractor double - image mode to do photometry in the @xmath29 and @xmath12 bands at the positions of the @xmath31-band detections , using the same @xmath39 aperture .",
    "finally we applied aperture correction to a large aperture using standard stars in the same field @xcite , and corrected for galactic extinction using @xcite .",
    "because of the rarity of high - redshift quasars and overwhelming number of contaminants , our selection procedure of faint @xmath40 quasars contains several steps .",
    "it is similar to the procedure used in paper i :    1 .",
    "select @xmath12-dropout sources from the sdss co - added data .",
    "objects with @xmath41 and @xmath42 that were not detected in the @xmath29 band were selected as @xmath12-dropout objects .",
    "the color cut separates high - redshift quasars from the majority of stellar objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; @xmath43 corresponds roughly to a 10 @xmath44 detection , i.e. , magnitude errors of @xmath45 mag",
    "remove false @xmath12-dropout objects .",
    "all @xmath12-dropout objects were visually inspected , and false detections were deleted from the list of candidates . in paper",
    "i , the majority of the contaminants were cosmic rays .",
    "in this paper we incorporated a sigma clipping algorithm into swarp during the pixel co - addition , which removes almost all cosmic rays as well as high proper - motion objects .",
    "the remaining cosmic rays were recognized by visually comparing the individual multi - epoch images making up the co - adds .",
    "roughly 140 objects with @xmath42 remained at this stage .",
    "nir photometry of @xmath12-dropout objects .",
    "we then carried out @xmath46-band photometry of the @xmath12-dropout objects selected from the previous step .",
    "the details of the nir observations are described in section 3.2 below . using the @xmath47 versus @xmath48 color - color diagrams ( figure 2 in paper i ) ,",
    "high - redshift quasar candidates were separated from brown dwarfs .",
    "we selected quasars with the following criteria , @xmath49 we also carried out @xmath50-band photometry for some candidates , especially those that were barely detected in the @xmath12 band and thus have large @xmath47 uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath50 band fills in the gap between @xmath31 and @xmath46 , and the @xmath51 color efficiently separates brown dwarfs from high - redshift quasars , since most dwarfs from early l to late t have @xmath51 colors close to 1 , while @xmath0 quasars usually have @xmath51 colors below 0.8 .",
    "so we applied the criterion @xmath52 to the candidates for which we had @xmath50-band photometry .",
    "25 objects remained at this stage . note that the @xmath12 and @xmath31 magnitudes are ab magnitudes and the @xmath50 and @xmath46 magnitudes are vega - based magnitudes .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy of quasar candidates .",
    "the final step is to carry out optical spectroscopic observations of quasar candidates to identify high - redshift quasars .",
    "the details of the spectroscopic observations are described in section 3.2 .",
    "we applied the above selection criteria to the data in the range @xmath53 .",
    "the data contain some `` holes '' in which the coadded images were not available .",
    "the effective area is @xmath54 deg@xmath2 .",
    "in addition to this main search of quasars down to @xmath43 , we also selected 35 @xmath12-dropout objects with @xmath55 in the range @xmath56 .",
    "eight of them passed the criteria of the third step .",
    "this is to test how deep one can reach with the sdss co - added images .",
    "we obtained @xmath46 and @xmath50-band photometry of the @xmath12-dropouts using the noao sqiid infrared camera @xcite on the 4 m telescope at kpno and the nir imager panic @xcite on the magellan telescopes at chile .",
    "the sqiid observations were made in 2007 october .",
    "sqiid produces simultaneous images of the same field in the @xmath46 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 bands .",
    "the pixel size is @xmath59 and the field of view ( fov ) is about @xmath60 .",
    "we used a @xmath61 , @xmath62 , or @xmath63 dither pattern of @xmath64 offsets to obtain good sky subtraction and to remove cosmic rays .",
    "the exposure time at each dither position was 2 min , which was the co - addition of 8 separate 15 s exposures .",
    "the total integration time on individual targets was therefore 8 , 12 , or 16 min .",
    "the sqiid data were reduced using the package ` upsqiid ' within iraf .",
    "briefly , for each object the sqiid data were dark - subtracted and flat - fielded .",
    "the flat field was the median of 3050 science images taken at the same night .",
    "the flat field was also used to create a bad pixel mask .",
    "after bad pixels were repaired by interpolation , the sky background was measured and subtracted from the science images .",
    "finally the processed science data were combined to one co - added image .",
    "a few standard stars were taken during the night to measure the aperture correction and to carry out absolute flux calibration .",
    "panic observations in @xmath50 and @xmath46 were made in 2007 october and 2008 august .",
    "the pixel size of panic is @xmath65 and the fov is about @xmath66 .",
    "we used a 5-position dither pattern with a dither offset of @xmath67 .",
    "the exposure time at each dither position varied from 60 to 120 s , so the total integration time on individual targets was 510 min .",
    "the panic data were reduced using the iraf panic package .",
    "the basic procedure is similar to what we did for the sqiid data .",
    "after a dark was subtracted and a linearity correction was applied , the frames of each object were flat - fielded .",
    "the flat field was created from twilight images . then the sky background was measured and subtracted .",
    "the processed images were corrected for distortion and were combined .",
    "after nir photometry of the @xmath12-dropouts , 25 objects with @xmath42 and 8 objects with @xmath68 satisfied the criteria in section 3.1 .",
    "optical spectroscopy of these candidates was carried out using the the red channel spectrograph on the mmt in 2007 november and 2008 october .",
    "the observations were performed in long - slit mode with a spectral resolution of @xmath69  .",
    "the exposure time for each target was 1530 min , which was sufficient to identify our candidates under normal weather conditions on the mmt .",
    "if a target was identified as a quasar , several additional exposures were taken to improve the spectral quality .",
    "the quasar data were reduced using standard iraf routines .",
    "from the spectroscopic observations of 32 candidates on the mmt we discovered six new quasars at @xmath0 in the sdss deep stripe .",
    "the other candidates are all late m or l / t dwarfs .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath31-band finding charts of the quasars , and table 1 gives their optical and nir properties .",
    "the @xmath70 and @xmath71 magnitudes are taken from the sdss deep imaging data , and the @xmath50 and @xmath46 magnitudes are obtained from our sqiid and panic observations .",
    "four of the six quasars were discovered in our main quasar search and comprise a flux - limited sample at @xmath42 .",
    "the other two quasars were found among our @xmath68 candidates ( although they are not a complete sample ) ; their discovery implies that we can reach deeper than @xmath3 in the future .",
    "figure 2 shows the optical spectra of the six quasars .",
    "the total exposure time on each quasar was 90120 min on the mmt .",
    "each spectrum has been scaled to the corresponding @xmath71 magnitude given in table 1 , and thereby is on an absolute flux scale with an uncertainty of @xmath69% .    in paper",
    "i redshifts were measured from either the ly@xmath7 , nv  @xmath721240 ( hereafter nv ) , or the oi  @xmath73 ( hereafter oi ) emission line , but the quasars in this paper are one magnitude fainter , and the spectra do not have the s / n to detect weak lines .",
    "we thus estimate the redshifts from ly@xmath7 .",
    "four quasars , sdss j023930.24004505.4ddmmss.s , and the positions are expressed in j2000.0 coordinates .",
    "we use sdss jhhmm@xmath74ddmm for brevity . ] ( hereafter sdss j02390045 ) , sdss j214755.41 + 010755.3 ( hereafter sdss j2147 + 0107 ) , sdss j230735.35 + 003149.4 ( hereafter sdss j2307 + 0031 ) , and sdss",
    "j235651.58 + 002333.3 ( hereafter sdss j2356 + 0023 ) , have prominent ly@xmath7   emission lines . for each of them",
    ", we measure the ly@xmath7  line center using a gaussian profile to fit the upper @xmath75% of the line .",
    "redshifts derived from the ly@xmath7  line center are usually biased because the blue side of ly@xmath7   is affected by ly@xmath7  forest absorption .",
    "the mean shift with respect to the systemic redshift at @xmath76 is about 600 km s@xmath22 @xcite , corresponding to @xmath77 at @xmath0 .",
    "we correct for this bias for the redshifts of the four quasars .",
    "the other two quasars , sdss j012958.51003539.7 ( hereafter sdss j01290035 ) and sdss j205321.77 + 004706.8 ( hereafter sdss j2053 + 0047 ) , show very weak ly@xmath7   emission .",
    "their redshifts are simply estimated from the position of the onset of sharp ly@xmath7  absorption .",
    "the results are listed in column 2 of table 1 .",
    "the redshift error of 0.03 quoted in the table is the scatter in the relation between ly@xmath7  redshifts and systemic redshifts measured from other lines @xcite , which is much larger than the statistical uncertainty of our fitting process .",
    "we measure the rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) and full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the ly@xmath7  emission line for each quasar , after fitting and subtracting the continuum .",
    "the wavelength coverage of each spectrum is too short to fit the continuum slope , so we assume that it is a power law with a slope @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) , and normalize it to the spectrum at rest frame 12751295  , a continuum window with little contribution from line emission . for the four quasars with prominent ly@xmath7  emission , we use double gaussian profiles to fit the broad and narrow components of ly@xmath7 . in sdss j2356 + 0023 , nv  is clearly detected and blended with ly@xmath7 , so we add an additional gaussian profile for that line .",
    "since the blue side of the ly@xmath7  emission line is strongly absorbed by the ly@xmath7  forest , we only fit the red side of the line and assume that the unabsorbed line is symmetric .",
    "we ignore the weak siii  @xmath80 emission line on the red side of nv .",
    "for the two quasars whose ly@xmath7  emission is very weak , we calculate the ly@xmath7+nv  ew by integrating the continuum - subtracted spectra over the wavelength range 1216   @xmath81 1250  .",
    "the measured ew and fwhm are shown in table 2 .",
    "we also give the fwhm of ly@xmath7   in units of km s@xmath22 .",
    "the ew and fwhm of ly@xmath7  for sdss j02390045 , sdss j2147 + 0107 , sdss j2307 + 0031 , and sdss j2356 + 0023 have taken into account the effect of ly@xmath7  forest absorption ; while for sdss j01290035 and sdss j2053 + 0047 , the listed ew values include the nv   line , and were not corrected for ly@xmath7  forest absorption .",
    "the best - fitting power - law continuum is also used to calculate @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the apparent and absolute ab magnitudes of the continuum at rest - frame 1450  .",
    "the results are given in the last two columns of table 2 .",
    "the quasars in this paper have average ly@xmath7  ew and fwhm of 31   and 10   ( with large scatters of 23   and 5  ) , significantly smaller than those in typical low - redshift quasars or more luminous quasars at @xmath0 ( paper i ) .",
    "this is not caused by a selection effect , since quasars with stronger ly@xmath7   emission have larger @xmath47 colors and thus are easier to find by our selection criteria .",
    "the narrowness of the ly@xmath7  emission lines may imply small central black hole masses in these high - redshift objects .",
    "black hole masses in quasars can be estimated from the widths of broad emission lines ; strong uv lines such as civ  @xmath721549 ( hereafter civ ) and mgii  @xmath722800 ( hereafter mgii ) are frequently used ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
