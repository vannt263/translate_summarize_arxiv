    "it is well understood that the highly super - eddington luminosities associated with grb are liable to put most of their energy into a baryonic wind if the energy release is in a position to drag matter outward .",
    "one solution for this ( meszaros and rees 1994 ) is that at distances @xmath5 cm from the central burster , internal shocks in a baryonic outflow release some fraction of the bulk expansion energy by accelerating particles , which then radiate @xmath6-rays .",
    "this probably predicts that typically 10 to 50 percent of the energy can be recovered and put back into radiation .",
    "it also predicts that the @xmath6-rays are always accompanied by baryonic outflow along the same direction to within @xmath7 .",
    "alternatively , it may be supposed that the energy release is originally devoid of baryons ( e.g. if the energy emerged along event horizon -threading field lines [ eichler and levinson , 1993 ] ) and the the baryon content of the grb fireball is whatever it swept up subsequently , either from the sides ( eichler and levinson 1999 , levinson and eichler 2003 ) , or from the ambient material into which the fireball expands ( e.g. meszaros and rees 1992 , lyutikov and blandford 2004 ) . if the fireball were able to sweep up ambient material without having any baryons originally , then afterglow would be `` guaranteed '' provided that the ambient medium has sufficient density .",
    "however , if the asymptotic lorentz factor @xmath8 of the fireball were too large , then it would not pick up ambient matter ; early baryon loading or an initial baryon content , which keeps @xmath8 from getting too large , is probably necessary for the grb to have afterglow .",
    "moreover , the poynting flux may be considerably less than the @xmath6-ray flux from the central object , and baryon loading from the side downstream of such a fireball s point of origin could reclaim some of the @xmath6-ray energy for generating afterglow if its optical depth exceeded unity .",
    "the case can thus be made that baryon loading from the sides of such a fireball , as it exits a baryon rich surrounding , can enhance the blast efficiency until it is of order unity .",
    "( in this paper , blast efficiency , @xmath9 refers to the isotropic equivalent kinetic energy @xmath10 divided by the isotropic equivalent @xmath6-ray energy output , @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath6-ray efficiency , @xmath0 , refers to the inverse of the blast efficiency , and either quantity can be greater than unity . )    there is no guarantee that early baryon loading from the sides penetrates the entire fireball ; there exists the logical possibility that one could have a @xmath6-ray bright grb with little or very weak afterglow .",
    "previous estimates ( levinson and eichler 2003 , eichler and levinson 2004 [ el04 ] ) suggested a picture in which the penetration is only 1/3 to 1/2 of the angular distance to the center from the outside , depending on the duration .",
    "longer bursts allow greater penetration because the penetrating baryons are freely streaming neutrons , and the larger the radius they are allowed to penetrate , the lower the lorentz factor of the fluid at the surface from which free streaming begins .",
    "observers close to the axis of symmetry might therefore see afterglow only if the spread in the afterglow beam , which is smeared by an additional @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the lorentz factor of the blast at observer time t ) beyond the angle into which the baryons have penetrated , covers their line of sight .",
    "typical numbers might be a beam opening angle of @xmath14 radians , a penetration angle of 0.03 to 0.04 radians , corresponding to @xmath15 ( where @xmath15 is the lorentz factor of the penetrating baryons ( levinson and eichler 2003 ) , and @xmath12 for typical afterglow observation times of @xmath1610 hours is about 1/30 to 1/10 .",
    "although this is about enough to cover the entire range of viewing angles over which the grb would be seen , it is just barely so .",
    "given the scatter in parameters so natural to astrophysical systems , we might expect to see , every now and then , a baryon - underloaded grb with little or very weak afterglow .",
    "delayed - afterglow ( granot et al 2002 ) or briefly - delayed afterglow ( eichler 2005 ) is another possibility .    in this letter",
    "we discuss whether the observations of several dozen afterglows are consistent with the hypothesis that some afterglows have far less afterglow efficiency than the majority .",
    "we find that they are ; there are four or five obvious outliers relative to an otherwise expected distribution of afterglow efficiencies clustering `` near '' unity ( but see below ) .",
    "it can not of course be proved that the reason for the poor afterglow efficiency is baryon underloading .",
    "it may be due to a lower ambient density ( e.g. fan et al and references therein ) that has the effect of spreading the afterglow over a longer timescale thus lowering the afterglow luminosity .",
    "however , this could be resolved with sufficiently thorough observations and a sufficiently large database .    in order to minimize the likelihood of indirect correlations , we first recall that afterglow efficiency is correlated with location of spectral peak @xmath3 ( lloyd - ronning and zhang 2004 [ lrz ] ) .",
    "softer grb seem to have lower blast efficiencies ; the efficiencies scale roughly as @xmath1 with @xmath17 ( see below ) .",
    "this , and its possible physical interpretations , are discussed in section 2 .",
    "we then plot the afterglow efficiency corrected for this correlation against burst duration and show a ) that the data appear better organized after the correction , b ) that the majority of grb have inferred blast efficiencies of roughly 1/7 , which could possibly be identified with baryon saturation , given the uncertainties and c ) that there is no conclusive correlation with burst duration , with the present sample .",
    "we also note that several grb are outliers to this correlation and all of them have anomalously _ high _ values for @xmath0 .",
    "it is emphasized that the results are not meant to be convincing beyond reasonable doubt .",
    "they are meant to show trends that we suggest should be checked with the much richer data set that swift should provide .",
    "the significance of the trends , if real , would be some or all of the following implications : a ) most grb have blast energies that are at least somewhat lower than the @xmath6-ray energies .",
    "previous estimates may have been influenced by the preferential underrepresentation of the @xmath6-ray energies , relative to afterglow energies , by off - beam observers .",
    "b ) while most grb in the data set cluster around a value of @xmath0 of order a few , several have extremely large values of @xmath0 .",
    "these could plausibly be interpreted as baryon - underloaded grb . according to freedman and waxman ( 2001 ) ,",
    "the blast energy estimate is independent of ambient density and they can not be interpreted as grb that took place in an underdense environment if the observed x - ray frequency is above the cooling frequency , though it can be posited that the ambient density and/or magnetic field energy was anomalously low and that the cooling frequency was anomalously high .",
    "c ) there is some indication that some of the anomalous grb with very high @xmath0 tend to be short , and could thus be attributed to a qualitatively different type of phenomenon and/or environment .",
    "the search for afterglow from short grb that can be undertaken with swift will thus be important .",
    "however , three of the five lasted longer than 25 seconds and have no apparent distinguishing characteristics other than a weak afterglow .",
    "d ) various explanations for the amati et al correlation can be tested with a good enough data set .",
    "the values of @xmath3 and @xmath18 correlate according to the relation @xmath19 ( amati et al 2002 , atteia et al 2004 ) .",
    "two possible accounts of the @xmath20 correlation are a ) the dirty fireball model ( e.g. dermer 1999 , qin et al 1998 ) , in which baryon overloading delays transparency until photons have softened to x - ray energies and b ) off - beam viewing , in which the observed @xmath3 is lessened by kinematic effects , viz .",
    "the reduced blue shift at the observer s viewing angle relative to that seen by an observer in the beam ( el04 ) .    in the viewing angle model for the amati",
    "et al relation proposed by ( el04 ) , the apparent total isotropic equivalent fluence is viewer angle dependent .",
    "it is lowered by a viewing angle offset from the closest part of the beam by angle @xmath21 , approximately as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "this is opposed to the @xmath24 dependence that would apply to a thin pencil beam because the solid angle that makes a significant contribution to what is detected by observers just outside the beam is roughly proportional to the factor @xmath25 .",
    "earlier discussions of off - beam viewing ( yamazaki et al 2002 , 2004 ) predict a different @xmath26 relation and attribute the amati et al relation to an unspecified intrinsic correlation .",
    "a second distinction to be noted in the context of this paper is that here we are considering the possibility of baryon poor lines of sight which nevertheless emit @xmath6-rays .",
    "the apparent afterglow fluence is also be reduced by off - beam viewing , but generally not as much .",
    "freedman and waxman ( 2001 ) noted that x - ray afterglow fluence at @xmath2710 hours could be used as a calorimeter for the blast energy .",
    "the lorentz factor after 10 hours , the typical time for bepposax measurements of afterglow , @xmath28 , is expected to be about a factor of 10 less ( if the expansion is into a uniform medium ) than the lorentz factor at 100 seconds , @xmath29 .",
    "( the subscript p is for `` prompt '' , which refers to @xmath30s . )",
    "hence the reduction in prompt fluence _ relative _ to the fluence of x - ray afterglow is given by @xmath31 ^ 2/\\left[d(\\theta,\\gamma_x)/d(0,\\gamma_x)\\right]^2 \\label{effa}\\ ] ]    by hypothesis that @xmath3 is established by viewing angle effects ,    @xmath32    after using ( 2 ) to eliminate the viewing angle in favor in @xmath3 , equation ( 1 ) becomes : @xmath33 ^ 2\\ ] ]    over the range of viewing angles @xmath34 , @xmath35 ^ 2 % \\label{epsa}\\ ] ] thus the viewing angle explanation for the amati et al relation predicts that the apparent ratio of gamma ray energy to blast energy @xmath36 should decrease as @xmath37 decreases , as described by equation ( 4 )",
    ". weak correlation in the intrinsic @xmath3 with the opening angle ( see fig . 6 below ) and the fact that the beam probably does not have a sharp edge could cause the correlation to deviate somewhat from equation ( 4 ) .",
    "so might other indirect correlations .",
    "also , pole to equator energy transfer , a true physical effect ( kumar & granot 2003 ) , may play some role . in any event",
    ", we expect the qualitative correlation to survive these considerations .",
    "we have plotted @xmath6-ray efficiency @xmath0 against @xmath37 , defining efficiency as @xmath38 where @xmath10 is the isotropic equivalent kinetic energy of the grb ejecta .",
    "we have used the @xmath10 values as presented in lrz based on x - ray afterglow luminosity in berger et al ( 2003 ) we add more data to the plot in figure 7 of lrz , using the correlation between x - ray afterglow at ten hours and blast energy to estimate @xmath10 for grb 980326 , grb 980329 and grb 000214 .",
    "the efficiency grb 990506 has been taken from freedman & waxman ( 2001 ) .",
    "the data for grb 980329 have a large uncertainty as the redshift is uncertain ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "we have used the estimates by ghirlanda et al for @xmath40 and @xmath41 . using equation ( 1 ) in berger et al ( 2003 ) , and the relation between @xmath42 and @xmath43 of lrz , . ]",
    "this would give grb 980329 an isotropic blast kinetic energy value of @xmath44 .    the radiative efficiency we calculate differs from that as calculated by freedman & waxman ( 2001 ) who used an assumed value for the redshift for their calculations .",

    "if they result from neutron star coalescence ( goodman 1986 , paczynski 1986 , eichler et al 1989 , paczynski 1990 ) , then they might take place in regions of low ambient density ( fan et al 2004 and references therein ) , which would weaken and prolong their afterglow .",
    "here we have called attention to several weak afterglows whose grbs were not so short , such as grbs 011211 , 990705 , and 980329 .",
    "we know of no _ a priori _ particular reason for them to have had weak afterglows and suggest that they may have been the occasional bursts that we view along baryon - poor lines of sight .    with mounting evidence that grbs may be divided into subclasses which shed light on jet structure or the cause of grbs ( see bloom et al 2003 ) ,",
    "our hypothesis would add yet another distinction between populations of grbs .",
    "relying on previous work , we find that for the grbs with available data , 5 of 22 appear unassociated with what is otherwise a closely clustered population in blast efficiencies .",
    "all of them have a weak afterglow , ( high radiative efficiency ) , whereas none were particularly deviant in the opposite direction .",

    "( the slightly shallower than @xmath37 dependence found by ghirlanda et al . could be attributed at least in part to a removal in the intrinsic scatter of @xmath18 , if wider beams tend to have lower @xmath3 . from fig .",
    "6 , it appears as though they do but we do not yet know the reason .",
    "perhaps a wider beam allows more opportunity for off - beam viewing . ) in any case , there may be additional causes for scatter in @xmath3 such as a dirty fireball effect , which would lower both @xmath3 and @xmath89 but not @xmath10 .",
    "however , it would do so at the cost of imposing an extremely small radiative efficiency . curiously , we find that @xmath6-ray efficiency has nearly the same dependence on @xmath3 as does @xmath89 in the correlation noted by ghirlanda et al .",
    "this could be attributed to the simple fact that apparent @xmath6-ray luminosity depends more on viewing angle than does apparent afterglow luminosity .",
    "it is anticipated that swift data will reveal whether there are more grbs distinct from the majority by their high radiative efficiency .",
    "the sample we have used is not free of all bias ; on the other hand , the sample of available redshifts may itself suffer a possible selection bias against weak afterglows , so the eventual fraction of weak afterglow grb may be considerably different from the 5 of 22 portrayed here .",
    "the significance of this result , if valid , is that the blast energy as a fraction of the total is only about 1/7 , and that instances where it is greater can be largely attributed to viewing angle dependent reduction of the apparent radiative efficiency .",
    "theoretical estimates for the dissipation efficiency of the internal shocks vary ( kumar 1999 , guetta , spada , waxman , 2001 , beloborodov , 2000 , kobayashi , sari , 2001 ) , but in principle this efficiency can be large . given the uncertainties and possible systematic errors , both in afterglow observations and in the theory , the value of 7 for the ratio of isotropic equivalent @xmath6-ray energy to isotropic equivalent kinetic energy could be interpreted as a not implausible value for a baryon - saturated outflow .",
    "however , it may be uncomfortably large for the scenario in which internal shocks in a baryonic outflow convert kinetic energy to @xmath6-ray energy .",
