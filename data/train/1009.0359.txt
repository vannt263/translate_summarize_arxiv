    "recently , four new charmed mesons , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , were observed by babar collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath16 with neutral charge were first found in the @xmath17 channel .",
    "then their isospin partners @xmath18 and @xmath19 were observed in @xmath20 as well",
    ". further analysis of the @xmath21 invariant mass spectrum confirmed the @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , two additional new charmed mesons , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , were found in the @xmath21 channel .",
    "the measured branching ratio fractions are @xmath24 the other observed results are summarized in tab .  [ wfs ] . to determine the spin - parity @xmath25 of these newly observed charmed mesons , the babar collaboration also analyzed their helicity distributions .",
    "these newly observed charmed mesons make great progress in the establishment of the charmed meson spectroscopy . from the pdg book  @xcite",
    ", it is seen that only six low - lying states , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , have been established .",
    "the higher excitations , @xmath32 and @xmath33 waves , are still absent .",
    "thus , the find of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 provides us a good opportunity to establish the missing @xmath32 and @xmath33 states .",
    "the @xmath22 may be identified as the radial excitation of the @xmath34 ( i.e. @xmath14 )  @xcite , for its quark model predicted mass @xmath35 gev  @xcite , helicity distribution ( @xmath36 )  @xcite and dominated decay mode @xmath37 consist with the observations .",
    "the @xmath1 is observed in both @xmath38 and @xmath37 channels , thus , its possible @xmath25 are @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 states .",
    "the babar analysis of helicity distribution ( @xmath41 )  @xcite also indicates that the @xmath1 may be @xmath39 or @xmath40 assignments  @xcite .",
    "the typical quark model predicted mass of @xmath4 is @xmath42 gev  @xcite , which is much larger than that of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the @xmath1 as the @xmath5 assignment should be excluded",
    ".    the @xmath2 and @xmath3 may be good candidates of @xmath26 wave states for their masses are close to those of @xmath26 waves predicted in various quark models  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath23 is observed in @xmath21 channel , its possible @xmath25 are @xmath39 , @xmath43 and @xmath40 .",
    "the helicity distribution of the @xmath44 and @xmath40 assignments is a simple @xmath45 distribution  @xcite , which is inconsistent with the babar observation that the @xmath23 does not show a simple helicity distribution  @xcite .",
    "although the mass of @xmath3 is very close to that of @xmath2 , they may be two different states for their mass and width values differ by 2.6@xmath46 and 1.5@xmath46 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the observation of @xmath3 in @xmath38 channel indicates it may be a candidate of @xmath12 or @xmath4 .    to distinguish the different candidates for these newly observed charmed mesons , in this work",
    ", we study their strong decay properties in a constituent quark model , which has been developed and successfully used to deal with the strong decays of heavy - light mesons and charmed baryons  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the strong decays of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 were studied by liu _",
    "_ in a @xmath47 model  @xcite . for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the main @xmath47 model predictions are compatible with our quark model predictions . in  @xcite ,",
    "two candidates are suggested for the @xmath3 .",
    "they are the mixed state via @xmath13-@xmath12 mixing and @xmath4 , respectively . in our predictions , only the @xmath4 is the favored assignment to @xmath3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the subsequent section",
    ", a brief review of the model is given .",
    "the numerical results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",

    ".summary of the experimental results . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this work",
    "we have studied the strong decay properties of the newly observed @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 by babar collaboration in a constituent chiral quark model .",
    "these newly observed charmed mesons provide us a chance to establish a more completed @xmath26 meson spectroscopy , which has been shown in tab .",
    "[ dds ] . for comparison",
    ", the @xmath48 meson spectroscopy is also included .",
    "we have found that @xmath22 as the @xmath14 is still questionable .",
    "the predicted narrow width of @xmath14 is inconsistent with the observation , although its decay modes , helicity distributions and theoretical predicted mass satisfy this classification .",
    "given the poor statistics of @xmath22 , its decay width may be overestimated by experimentalists .",
    "we expect them to observe it in both @xmath37 and @xmath49 channels .",
    "the @xmath1 can be identified as the low mass mixed state @xmath50 via the @xmath13-@xmath12 mixing .",
    "this mixed state is also predicted in the @xmath48 meson spectroscopy , which corresponds to the @xmath51  @xcite . in our",
    "mixing scheme the high mass partner @xmath52 may be too broad to be observed in @xmath26 meson spectroscopy , while it might be found in @xmath48 spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "to understand the nature of @xmath1 further , we suggest to observe it in @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 channels .",
    "the @xmath3 is most likely to be the @xmath57 .",
    "its decays are governed by @xmath38 and @xmath37 , which can naturally explain why @xmath3 is first observed in @xmath38 channel .",
    "the predicted ratio is @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath3 as high mass partner of @xmath1 via the @xmath13-@xmath12 mixing was also suggested in  @xcite , where the predicted partial decay width of @xmath38 is tiny .",
    "further experimental measurement of the ratios @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 should be able to disentangle its properties .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 might be two different charmed meson states .",
    "the @xmath2 is favorably interpreted as the high mass mixed state @xmath6 ( @xmath43 ) via the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing .",
    "its low - mass partner @xmath62 may be too broad to be observed in experiments .",
    "to confirm the @xmath2 , the decay channels @xmath53 , @xmath49 , @xmath63 and @xmath54 are suggested to be observed in future experiments .",
    "finally , we should mention that in our previous work  @xcite , we predicted that @xmath64 might correspond to two largely overlapping resonances , one resonance is likely to be the @xmath4 [ denoted by @xmath65 and the other resonance seems to be the mixed state between @xmath9 and @xmath8 [ denoted by @xmath66 . combining the study of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 in present work , we easily conclude that both @xmath3 and @xmath67 are most likely to be the @xmath4 , while both @xmath2 and @xmath68 might be classified as the mixed state @xmath6 with almost the same mixing angle . to test our predictions and clarify the controversial situation of @xmath64  @xcite",
    ", we suggest to analyze the helicity distribution of @xmath69 in experiments .",
    "if the helicity distribution is in proportion to @xmath70 , the @xmath64 should be two largely overlapping resonances .",
