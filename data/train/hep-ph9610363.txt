    "in these lectures i will introduce the ideas of heavy quark symmetry and the heavy quark limit , which exploit the simplification of certain aspects of qcd for infinite quark mass , @xmath1 .",
    "we will see that while these ideas are extraordinarily simple from a physical point of view , they are of enormous practical utility in the study of the phenomenology of bottom and charmed hadrons .",
    "one reason for this is the existence not just of an interesting new limit of qcd , but of a systematic expansion about this limit .",
    "the technology of this expansion is the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) , which allows one to use heavy quark symmetry to make accurate predictions of the properties and behavior of heavy hadrons in which the theoretical errors are under control .",
    "while the emphasis in these lectures will be on the physical picture of heavy hadrons which emerges in the heavy quark limit , it will be important to introduce enough of the formalism of the hqet to reveal the structure of the heavy quark expansion as a simultaneous expansion in powers of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , what i hope to leave you with above all is an appreciation for the simplicity , elegance and coherence of the ideas which underlie the technical results which will be presented .",
    "the interested reader is also encouraged to consult a number of excellent reviews  @xcite , which typically cover in more detail the material in the first two sections of these lectures .",
    "why is an understanding of qcd crucial to the study of the properties of the bottom and charmed quarks ? as an example , consider semileptonic @xmath4 decay , @xmath5 .",
    "this process is mediated by a four - fermion operator , [ obcdef ] o_bc = g_fv_cb2|c^(1-^5)b    level , _",
    "quark = c||o_bc|b= g_fv_cb2|u_c(p_c)^(1-^5)u_b(p_b )    only relevant at very short distances ; at longer distances , qcd confinement implies that free @xmath4 and @xmath6 quarks are not asymptotic states of the theory . instead ,",
    "nonperturbative qcd effects `` dress '' the quark level transition @xmath5 to a hadronic transition , such as bd|bd^*|  ( in these lectures , we will use a convention in which a @xmath0 meson contains a @xmath4 quark , not a @xmath7 antiquark . )",
    "the hadronic matrix element @xmath8 depends on nonperturbative qcd as well as on @xmath9 , and is difficult to calculate from first principles . to disentangle the weak interaction part of this complicated process requires us to develop some understanding of the strong interaction effects .",
    "there are a variety of methods by which one can do this . perhaps the most popular , historically , has been use of various quark potential models  @xcite . while these models are typically very predictive , they are based on uncontrolled assumptions and approximations , and it is virtually impossible to estimate the theoretical errors associated with their use",
    "this is a serious defect if one builds such a model into the experimental extraction of a weak coupling constant such as @xmath10 , because the uncontrolled theoretical errors then infect the experimental result .",
    "another approach , the one to be discussed here , is to exploit as much as possible the fact that the @xmath4 and @xmath6 quarks are _ heavy _ ,",
    "by which we mean that @xmath11 .",
    "the scale @xmath12 is the typical energy at which qcd becomes nonperturbative , and is of the order of hundreds of mev .",
    "the physical quark masses are approximately @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the formalism which we will develop will not make as many predictions as do potential models .",
    "however , the compensation will be that we will develop a _",
    "systematic _ expansion in powers of @xmath15 , within which we will be able to do concrete error analysis . in particular , we will be able to estimate the error associated with the fact that @xmath16 may not be very close to the asymptotic limit @xmath17 .",
    "even where this error may be substantial , the fact that it is under control allows us to maintain predictive power in the theory .",
    "consider a hadron @xmath18 composed of a heavy quark @xmath19 and `` light degrees of freedom '' , consisting of light quarks , light antiquarks and gluons , in the limit @xmath1 .",
    "the compton wavelength of the heavy quark scales as the inverse of the heavy quark mass , @xmath20 .",
    "the light degrees of freedom , by contrast , are characterized by momenta of order @xmath12 , corresponding to wavelengths @xmath21 . since @xmath22",
    ", the light degrees of freedom can not resolve features of the heavy quark other than its conserved gauge quantum numbers .",
    "in particular , they can not probe the actual _ value _ of @xmath23 , that is , the value of @xmath24 .",
    "we draw the same conclusion in momentum space .",
    "the structure of the hadron @xmath18 is determined by nonperturbative strong interactions .",
    "the asymptotic freedom of qcd implies that when quarks and gluons exchange momenta @xmath25 much larger than @xmath12 , the process is perturbative in the strong coupling constant @xmath26 . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical momenta exchanged by the light degrees of freedom with each other and with the heavy quark are of order @xmath12 , for which a perturbative expansion is of no use . for these exchanges , however , @xmath27 , and the heavy quark @xmath19 does not recoil , remaining at rest in the rest frame of the hadron . in this limit",
    ", @xmath19 acts as a static source of electric and chromoelectric gauge field . the chromoelectric field , which holds @xmath18 together , is nonperturbative in nature ,",
    "but it is independent of @xmath24 .",
    "the result is that the properties of the light degrees of freedom depend only on the presence of the static gauge field , independent of the flavor and mass of the heavy quark carrying the gauge charge .",
    "there is an immediate implication for the spectroscopy of heavy hadrons . since the interaction of the light degrees of freedom with the heavy quark is independent of @xmath24 , then",
    "so is the spectrum of their excitations .",
    "it is these excitations which determine the spectrum of heavy hadrons @xmath18 .",
    "hence the _ splittings _ @xmath28 between the various hadrons @xmath29 are independent of @xmath19 and , in the limit @xmath1 , do not scale with @xmath24 .",
    "for example , the spectra of bottom and charmed mesons are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , in the limit @xmath11 .",
    "the light degrees of freedom are in exactly the same state in the mesons @xmath30 and @xmath31 , for a given @xmath32 .",
    "the offset @xmath33 is just the difference between the heavy quark masses ; in no way does the relationship between the spectra rely on an approximation @xmath34",
    ".    we can enrich this picture by recalling that the heavy quarks and light degrees of freedom also carry spin .",
    "the heavy quark has spin quantum number @xmath35 , which leads to a chromomagnetic moment _ q = g2m_q .",
    "note that @xmath36 as @xmath1 , and the interaction between the spin of the heavy quark and the light degrees of freedom is suppressed .",
    "hence the light degrees of freedom are insensitive to @xmath37 ; their state is independent of whether @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "thus each of the energy levels in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] is actually doubled , one state for each possible value of @xmath40 .",
    "to summarize , what we see is that the light degrees of freedom are the same when combined with any of the following heavy quark states : q_1(),q_1 ( ) ; q_2(),q_2 ( ) ;  q_n_h(),q_n_h ( ) , where there are @xmath41 heavy quarks ( in the real world , @xmath42 ) .",
    "the result is an @xmath43 symmetry which applies to the light degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "a new symmetry means new nonperturbative relations between physical quantities .",
    "it is these relations which we wish to understand and exploit .",
    "the light degrees of freedom have total angular momentum @xmath44 , which is integral for baryons and half - integral for mesons .",
    "when combined with the heavy quark spin @xmath35 , we find physical hadron states with total angular momentum j=|",
    "if @xmath45 , then these two states are degenerate .",
    "for example , the lightest heavy mesons have @xmath46 , leading to a doublet with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , in the charm system we find that the states of lowest mass are the spin-0 @xmath49 and the spin-1 @xmath50 ; the corresponding bottom mesons are the @xmath0 and @xmath51 .",
    "when effects of order @xmath52 are included , the chromomagnetic interactions split the states of given @xmath53 but different @xmath54 .",
    "this `` hyperfine '' splitting is not calculable perturbatively , but it is proportional to the heavy quark magnetic moment @xmath55 .",
    "this gives its scaling with @xmath24 : m_d^*-m_d & ~ & 1/m_c + m_b^*-m_b & ~ & 1/m_b .",
    "from this fact we can construct a relation which is a nonperturbative prediction of heavy quark symmetry , m_b^*^2-m_b^2=m_d^*^2-m_d^2 .",
    "experimentally , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , so this prediction works quite well .",
    "note that this relation involves not just the heavy quark symmetry , but the systematic inclusion of the leading symmetry violating effects .",
    "so far , we have formulated heavy quark symmetry for hadrons in their rest frame . of course",
    ", we can easily boost to a frame in which the hadrons have arbitrary four - velocity @xmath58 .",
    "for heavy quarks @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the symmetry will then relate hadrons @xmath61 and @xmath62 with the same velocity but with different momenta .",
    "this distinguishes heavy quark symmetry from ordinary symmetries of qcd , which relate states of the same momentum . to remind ourselves of this distinction ,",
    "henceforth we will label heavy hadrons explicitly by their velocity : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and so on .",
    "now let us return to the semileptonic weak decay @xmath5 , but now consider it in the heavy quark limit for the @xmath4 and @xmath6 quarks .",
    "suppose the decay occurs at time @xmath67 .",
    "for @xmath68 , the @xmath4 quark is embedded in a hadron @xmath69 ; for @xmath70 , the @xmath6 quark is dressed by light degrees of freedom to @xmath71 .",
    "let us consider the lightest hadrons , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "note that since the leptons carry away energy and momentum , in general @xmath74 .",
    "what happens to the light degrees of freedom when the heavy quark decays ?",
    "for @xmath68 , they see the chromoelectric field of a point source with velocity @xmath75 . at @xmath67 ,",
    "this point source recoils instantaneously . ] to velocity @xmath76 ; the color neutral leptons do not interact with the light hadronic degrees of freedom as they fly off .",
    "the light quarks and gluons then must reassemble themselves about the recoiling color source .",
    "this nonperturbative process will generally involve the production of an excited state or of additional particles ; the light degrees of freedom can exchange energy with the heavy quark , so there is no kinematic restriction on the excitations ( of energy @xmath77 ) which can be formed .",
    "there is also some chance that the light degrees of freedom will reassemble themselves back into a ground state @xmath49 meson .",
    "the amplitude for this to happen is a function only of the inner product @xmath78 of the initial and final velocities of the color sources .",
    "this amplitude , @xmath79 , is known as the isgur - wise function  @xcite .",
    "clearly , the kinematic point @xmath80 , or @xmath81 , is a special one . in this corner of phase space , where the leptons are emitted back to back",
    ", there is no recoil of the source of color field at @xmath67 . as far as the light degrees of freedom are concerned , _ nothing happens ! _ their state is unaffected by the decay of the heavy quark ; they do nt even notice it .",
    "hence the amplitude for them to remain in the ground state is exactly unity .",
    "this is reflected in a nonperturbative normalization of the isgur - wise function at zero recoil  @xcite , [ norm ] ( 1)=1 . as we will see , this normalization condition is of enormous phenomenological use",
    ". it will be extremely important to understand the corrections to this result for finite heavy quark masses @xmath82 and , especially , @xmath16 .",
    "the weak decay @xmath83 is mediated by a left - handed current @xmath84 .",
    "not only does this operator carry momentum , but it can change the orientation of the spin @xmath37 of the heavy quark during the decay . for a fixed light angular momentum @xmath44 , the relative orientation of @xmath37 determines whether the physical hadron in the final state is a @xmath49 or a @xmath50 .",
    "however , the light degrees of freedom are insensitive to @xmath37 , so the nonperturbative part of the transition is the same whether it is a @xmath49 or a @xmath50 which is produced .",
    "hence heavy quark symmetry implies relations between the hadronic matrix elements which describe the semileptonic decays @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "it is conventional to parameterize these matrix elements by a set of scalar form factors .",
    "these are defined separately for the vector and axial currents , as follows : [ formfactors ] d(v)||c^b|b(v)&= & h_+(w)(v+v)^+h_-(w)(v - v)^ + d^*(v,)||c^b|b(v)&= & h_v(w)i^_^*v_v _",
    "+ d(v)||c^^5 b|b(v)&= & 0 + d(v,)||c^^5 b|b(v)&= & h_a_1(w)(w+1)^*-^*v [ h_a_2(w)v^+h_a_3(w)v^].the set of form factors @xmath87 is the one appropriate to the heavy quark limit .",
    "other linear combinations are also found in the literature . in any case , the form factors are independent nonperturbative functions of the recoil or equivalently , for fixed @xmath82 and @xmath16 , of the momentum transfer . however , in the heavy quark limit they correspond to a _",
    "single _ transition of the light degrees of freedom , being distinguished from each other only by the relative orientation of the spin of the heavy quark .",
    "hence they may all be written in terms of the single function @xmath79 which describes this nonperturbative transition . as we will derive later",
    ", the result is a set of relations  @xcite , [ ffrelations ] & & h_+(w)=h_v(w)=h_a_1(w)=h_a_3(w)=(w ) + & & h_-(w)=h_a_2(w)=0 , which follow solely from the heavy quark symmetry . of course ,",
    "all of the form factors which do not vanish inherit the normalization condition ( [ norm ] ) at zero recoil .",
    "this result is a powerful constraint on the structure of semileptonic decay in the heavy quark limit .      as a final example of the utility of the heavy quark limit ,",
    "consider the coupling of the heavy meson field to the axial vector current .",
    "this is conventionally parameterized in terms of a decay constant ; for example , for the @xmath88 meson we define @xmath89 via [ fbdef ] 0||u^^5 b|b^-(p_b)=if_bp_b^. what is the dependence of the nonperturbative quantity @xmath89 on @xmath90 ? to address this question , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ fbdef ] ) in a form appropriate to taking the heavy quark limit , @xmath91 ( which is equivalent to @xmath92 ) .",
    "this entails making explicit the dependence of all quantities on @xmath90 .",
    "first , we trade the @xmath88 momentum for its velocity , p_b^=m_b v^. second , we replace the usual @xmath88 state , whose normalization depends on @xmath90 , b(p_1)|b(p_2)=2e_b^(3)(_1-_2 ) , by a mass - independent state , |b(v)=1|b(p_b ) , satisfying b(v_1)|b(v_2)=2^(3)(_1-_2 ) .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ fbdef ] ) becomes 0||u^^5 b|b^-(v ) = if_bm_bv^. the nonperturbative matrix element @xmath93 is independent of @xmath90 in the heavy quark limit .",
    "hence , we see that in this limit @xmath89 takes the form f_b = m_b^-1/2m_b ) .",
    "this makes explicit the scaling of @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "it is more interesting to write this as a prediction for the ratio of charmed and bottom meson decay constants .",
    "we find  @xcite [ fbfd ] f_bf_d= + o(m_d , m_b ) .",
    "for the physical bottom and charm masses , of course , the correction terms proportional to @xmath94 could be important .",
    "we have already extracted quite a bit of nontrivial information from the heavy quark limit .",
    "we have found the scaling of various quantities with @xmath24 , we have studied the implications for heavy hadron spectroscopy , and we have found nonperturbative relations among the hadronic form factors which describe semileptonic @xmath83 decay .",
    "however , all of these results have been obtained in the strict limit @xmath1 .",
    "if the heavy quark limit is to be of more than academic interest , and is to provide the basis for quantitative phenomenology , we have to understand how to include corrections systematically .",
    "there are actually two types of corrections which we would like to include .",
    "_ power corrections _ are subleading terms in the expansion in @xmath94 ; those proportional to @xmath95 are the most worrisome , because of the relatively small charm quark mass . _",
    "logarithmic corrections _ arise from the implicit dependence of quantities on @xmath24 through the strong coupling constant @xmath96 . for the physical values of @xmath82 and @xmath16 ,",
    "either of these could be important .",
    "what we need is a formalism which can accommodate them both .    in short ,",
    "we need to go from a set of heavy quark symmetry predictions in the @xmath1 limit , to a reformulation of qcd which provides a controlled expansion about this limit .",
    "the formalism which does the job is the heavy quark effective theory , or the hqet .",
    "the purpose of the hqet is to allow us to extract , explicitly and systematically , all dependence of physical quantities on @xmath24 , in the limit @xmath97 . in these lectures",
    ", we will develop only enough of the technology to treat the dominant leading effects , providing indications along the way of how one would carry the expansion further .",
    "the hqet , as formulated here , was developed in a series of papers going back to the late 1980 s  @xcite , which the reader who is interested in tracking its historical development may consult .",
    "consider the kinematics of a heavy quark @xmath19 , bound in a hadron with light degrees of freedom to make a color singlet state .",
    "the small momenta which @xmath19 typically exchanges with the rest of the hadron are of order @xmath98 , and they never take @xmath19 far from its mass shell , @xmath99 .",
    "hence the momentum @xmath100 can be decomposed into two parts , p_q^=m_q v^+k^ , where @xmath101 is the constant on - shell part of @xmath100 , and @xmath102 is the small , fluctuating `` residual momentum '' .",
    "the on - shell condition for the heavy quark then becomes m_q^2=(m_qv^+k^)^2=m_q^2 + 2m_qvk+k^2 . in the heavy quark limit",
    "we may neglect the last term , and we have the simple condition vk=0 for an on - shell heavy quark . here",
    "the velocity @xmath103 functions as a label ; since soft interactions can not change @xmath103 , there is a _ velocity superselection rule _ in the heavy quark limit , and @xmath103 is a good quantum number of the qcd hamiltonian .",
    "we find the same result by taking the @xmath1 limit of the heavy quark propagator , ivk+i . in this limit",
    "the propagator is independent of @xmath24 .",
    "the projection operators p_=1/v2 project onto the positive ( @xmath104 ) and negative ( @xmath105 ) frequency parts of the dirac field @xmath19 .",
    "this is clear in the dirac representation in the rest frame , in which @xmath104 and @xmath105 project , respectively , onto the upper two and lower two components of the heavy quark spinor . in the limit @xmath1 , in which @xmath19 remains almost on shell , only the `` large '' upper components of the field @xmath19 propagate ; mixing via zitterbewegung with the `` small '' lower components",
    "is suppressed by @xmath106 .",
    "hence the action of the projectors on @xmath19 is p_+q(x)=q(x)+o(1/m_q),p_-q(x)=0+o(1/m_q ) .",
    "the momentum dependence of the field @xmath19 is given by its action on a heavy quark state , q(x)|q(p)=e^-ipx|0 .",
    "if we now multiply both sides by a phase corresponding to the on - shell momentum , e^im_qvxq(x)|q(p)=e^-ikx|0 , the right side of this equation is independent of @xmath24 .",
    "hence the left side must be , as well .",
    "combining this observation with the argument of the previous paragraph , we are motivated to define a @xmath24-_independent _ effective heavy quark field @xmath107 , h_v(x)=e^im_qvxp_+q(x ) .",
    "note that the effective field carries a velocity label @xmath75 and is a two - component object .",
    "the modifications to the ordinary field @xmath108 project out the positive frequency part and ensure that states annihilated by @xmath107 have no dependence on @xmath24 .",
    "hence , these are reasonable candidate fields to carry representations of the heavy quark symmetry .",
    "of course , the small components can not be neglected when effects of order @xmath52 are included . in the hqet",
    "they are represented by a field h_v(x)=e^im_qvxp_-q(x ) .",
    "the field @xmath109 vanishes in the @xmath1 limit .",
    "the ordinary qcd lagrange density for a field @xmath108 is given by _",
    "qcd = q(x)(i - m_q)q(x ) , where @xmath110 is the gauge covariant derivative . to find the lagrangian of the hqet",
    ", we substitute q(x)=e^-im_qvxh_v(x)+  into @xmath111 and expand . with the aid of the projection identity @xmath112",
    ", we find = |h_v(x)ivdh(x ) .",
    "this simple lagrangian leads to the propagator we derived earlier , , and to an equally simple quark - gluon vertex , igt^av^a^a_. note that both the propagator and the vertex are independent of @xmath24 , reflecting the heavy quark flavor symmetry .",
    "they also have no dirac structure , reflecting the heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "our intuitive statements about the structure of heavy hadrons have been promoted to explicit symmetries of the qcd lagrangian in the limit @xmath1 .",
    "it is straightforward to include power corrections to @xmath113 .",
    "write @xmath108 in terms of the effective fields , q(x)=e^-im_qvx , and apply the classical equation of motion @xmath114 : ih_v(x)+(i-2m_q)h_v(x)=0 . multiplying by @xmath105 and commuting @xmath115 to the right , we find ( ivd+2m_q)h_v(x)=i_h_v(x ) , where @xmath116",
    ". we then substitute @xmath108 into @xmath111 as before , eliminate @xmath109 and expand in @xmath52 to obtain [ hqetlagrangian ] & = & |h_vivdh_v+|h_vi _ 1ivd+2m_qi_h_v + & = & |h_vivdh_v+12m_q +  .",
    "the leading corrections have a simple interpretation , which becomes clear in the rest frame , @xmath117 . the spin - independent term is o_k=12m_q|h_v(id_)^2h_v -12m_q|h_v(id)^2h_v , which is the negative of the nonrelativistic kinetic energy of the heavy quark . because of the explicit factor of @xmath106 , this term violates the heavy flavor symmetry .",
    "the spin - dependent part is o_g= 12m_qg2|h_v^g_h_v|h_v^ijt^ah_vgg_ij^a= g_q^ab^a , which is the coupling of the spin of the heavy quark to the chromomagnetic field .",
    "because it has a nontrivial dirac structure , this term violates both the heavy flavor symmetry and the heavy spin symmetry . for example , @xmath118 is responsible for the @xmath119 and @xmath120 mass splittings .",
    "these correction terms will be treated as part of the _ interaction _ lagrangian , even though @xmath121 has a piece which is a pure bilinear in the heavy quark field .",
    "the expansion of the weak interaction current @xmath84 is analogous .",
    "however , here we must introduce separate effective fields for the charm and bottom quarks , each with its own velocity : bh^b_v , ch^c_v. then a general flavor - changing current becomes , to leading order , |c b|h^c_v h^b_v , where @xmath122 is a fixed dirac structure . with the leading power corrections ,",
    "this is [ current ] |c",
    "b|h^c_v h^b_v + 12m_b|h^c_v(i_)h^b_v + 12m_c|h^c_v(-i_)h^b_v +  .",
    "the effective currents , and other operators which appear in the hqet , may often be simplified by use of the classical equation of motion , ivd h_v(x)=0 .",
    "however , it is only safe to apply these equations naively at order @xmath52 ; at higher order the application of the equations of motion involves additional subtleties  @xcite .    to complete the effective theory , we need @xmath24-independent hadron states which are created and annihilated by currents containing the effective fields .",
    "for example , there is an effective pseudoscalar meson state @xmath123 which couples to the effective axial current @xmath124 , with a coupling @xmath125 which is independent of @xmath24 , [ matfm ] 0||q^^5 h_v|m(v)=if_mv^. at lowest order , @xmath125 is related to a conventional decay constant such as @xmath89 by f_b = f_m/ , from which we immediately find the relationship ( [ fbfd ] ) between @xmath126 and @xmath89 .",
    "we can use the effective lagrangian @xmath113 to compute the radiative corrections to the matrix element ( [ matfm ] ) .",
    "in particular , we would like to extract the dependence of @xmath125 on @xmath127 . this dependence comes through the one - loop renormalization of the current @xmath128 . at lowest order , of course",
    ", the renormalization is straightforward : we simply compute the set of graphs found in fig .",
    "[ fig : fqcd ] .",
    "the result is finite , because the current is ( partially ) conserved , and we extract a result of the form [ qcdcurrent ] |q^^5 q(1-|_0_s4 ( m_q / m_q)+  ) .",
    "note that there is no explicit dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath129 , since there is no divergence to be subtracted .",
    "the same result may be obtained in the effective theory . in this case",
    "we must match the currents in full qcd onto hqet currents of the form @xmath124 .",
    "this step will induce a matching coefficient containing the explicit dependence on @xmath24 , which is absent , by construction , from the operators and lagrangian of the hqet .",
    "can also induce new dirac structures @xmath130 .",
    "they do not affect the leading logarithms discussed here . ] in addition , the effective current will not necessarily be conserved , since the ultraviolet properties of qcd and the hqet differ .",
    "hence the form of the matching , once radiative corrections are included , is |q^^5 qc(m_q,)|q^^5 h_v .",
    "we can deduce the form of @xmath131 by considering the renormalization of the effective current @xmath124 , shown in the last three terms of fig .",
    "[ fig : fhqet ] .",
    "these diagrams , computed in the effective theory , are independent of @xmath24 .",
    "however , in general they are divergent , so they depend on the renormalization scale @xmath129 ; the renormalization takes the form |q^^5 h_v(c(m_q,)-_0_s ( /m_q)+  ) , where here @xmath132 acts as an infrared cutoff . the @xmath129 dependence in the second term",
    "must be canceled by @xmath131 .",

    "earlier , we argued on physical grounds that in the heavy quark limit all of the hadronic matrix elements which appear in these decays are related to a single nonperturbative function @xmath79 .",
    "now we will sharpen this analysis to actually _ derive _ these relations , and to include radiative and power corrections .",
    "in fact , almost all of our effort will go into the power corrections , since the radiative corrections to the transition currents are computed just as in the previous section .",
    "the transitions in question require the nonperturbative matrix elements d(v)||c^b|b(v ) , d^*(v,)||c^b|b(v ) , d^*(v,)||c^^5 b|b(v ) , parameterized in terms of form factors as in eq .",
    "( [ formfactors ] ) .",
    "our first task is to derive the relations between these form factors , as promised earlier .",
    "these relations depend on the heavy quark symmetry , that is , on the fact that the spin quantum numbers of @xmath19 and of the light degrees of freedom are separately conserved by the soft physics .",
    "hence we need a representation of the heavy meson states in which they have well defined transformations separately under the angular momentum operators @xmath37 and @xmath44 .",

    "when we also consider rotations under @xmath158 , we find that the matrix element is restricted to the general form [ matelgen ] (v)||h_vh_v|m(v)= -^1/2tr . the product of masses in front is a convention which restores the relativistic normalization of the states .",
    "note that the heavy quark symmetry allows an arbitrary @xmath148 dirac matrix @xmath159 to act on the `` light quark '' part of the superfields .",
    "its presence reflects the fact that , other than the constraint of lorentz symmetry , the behavior of the spin of the light degrees of freedom during the decay is unknown .",

    "at a fixed order in qcd perturbation theory , the answer is clear .",
    "the heavy quark masses which appear come from poles in quark propagators , so we should take @xmath233 ( and @xmath235 ) .",
    "this is also the prescription for the mass which cancels out the on - shell part of the heavy quark field in the construction of @xmath113 .",

    "however , it is important to realize that the only limit of qcd in which such terms actually dominate is that of large number of light quark flavors , in which case the sign of @xmath240 is opposite to that of qcd .",
    "although this is a physical limit of an abelian theory , we are certainly not close to that limit here .",
    "the ansatz of keeping only the terms proportional to @xmath239 is known as `` naive nonabelianization '' ( nna )  @xcite .    what is most interesting about the series of terms shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbubbles ] , @xmath241 , is that it does not converge .",
    "already in the graphs kept in the nna ansatz , we are sensitive to the fact that qcd is an asymptotic , rather than a convergent expansion . for large @xmath242 the coefficients @xmath243 diverge as @xmath244 , much stronger than any convergence due to the powers @xmath245 .",
    "the series can only be made meaningful if this divergence is subtracted .",
    "as with many subtraction prescriptions , there is a residual finite ambiguity .",
    "this ambiguity , known as an `` infrared renormalon '' , leads to an ambiguity in the pole mass of order  @xcite ~100 . by the definition ( [ lambardef ] )",
    ", @xmath171 also inherits this ambiguity .",
    "the expressions ( [ burate ] ) and ( [ bcrate ] ) are plagued by two problems .",

    "we can exploit this cancelation to improve the predictive power of the theoretical computation of the rate . without this improvement ,",
    "the infrared renormalons render the expressions ( [ burate ] ) and ( [ bcrate ] ) of dubious phenomenological utility .    the most reliable approach , theoretically , is to eliminate @xmath233 or @xmath171 explicitly from the rate by computing and measuring another quantity which also depends on it .",
    "for example , let us consider the charmless decay rate @xmath247 and the average invariant mass @xmath248 of the hadrons produced in the decay .",
    "each of these expressions suffers from a poorly behaved perturbation series in the nna approximation . ignoring terms of relative order @xmath184 and writing the rate in terms of @xmath171 instead of @xmath233",
    ", we find to five loop order  @xcite , & = & g_f^2|v_ub|^2192 ^ 3m_b^5 + & = & g_f^2|v_ub|^2192 ^ 3m_b^5 , for @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "as we see , not only does the perturbation series fail to converge , it does not even have an apparent smallest term , where one should truncate to minimize the error of the asymptotic series .",
    "the series for @xmath248 exhibits a similar behavior  @xcite , s_h&=&m_b^2 + & = & m_b^2 .",
    "however , the situation improves dramatically if we eliminate @xmath171 and write @xmath122 directly in terms of @xmath248 , = g_f^2|v_ub|^2192 ^ 3m_b^5 . by truncating this series at its smallest term , 0.0002",
    ", we obtain a new expression in which the theoretical errors are under control .",
    "the price is that we must now measure a second quantity , @xmath248 , in the same decay .",
    "an analogous approach works for inclusive decays to charm , in which case the new quantity which we must measure is @xmath251 .",
    "let us apply this analysis to the extraction of @xmath10 from the inclusive decay @xmath191 . eliminating @xmath171 as before , we find  @xcite [ width2 ] ( bx_c)&=&g_f^2|v_cb|^2192 ^ 3 m_b^50.369 , plus small terms of order @xmath252 .",
    "the current data on @xmath251 are still inconclusive , but they will improve in the future . as an illustration of the utility of the method , however , let us consider the physical limit @xmath253 . in that case , we already can obtain the bound v_cb0.037(_b1.54ps)^-1/2 , where we have used the observed @xmath0 semileptonic branching ratio of @xmath254 . as the data on @xmath251 improve , so will this bound .",
    "note that it is entirely consistent with the value ( [ vcbexcl ] ) obtained from exclusive decays .",
    "an alternative approach is to express the width @xmath122 in terms of the running mass @xmath232 instead of another inclusive observable  @xcite . since the @xmath231 mass is a short distance quantity , this also eliminates the infrared renormalon , which is associated with long distance physics .",
    "however , from a phenomenological point of view , it begs the question of how the running mass is to be determined from experiment .",
    "possibilities include quarkonium spectroscopy , qcd sum rules , and lattice calculations , but in all of these cases it is unclear both how to determine reliably the accuracy of the method , and how to deal with renormalon ambiguities in a manner that is _ consistent _ with their treatment in the calculation of @xmath122 . with additional progress",
    ", however , such an approach might eventually prove fruitful .",
    "so far we have applied the idea of heavy quark symmetry to heavy hadron spectroscopy and to heavy hadron decay .",
    "we can also apply it to heavy hadron production via fragmentation .",
    "although there is not yet available the wealth of detailed data for production processes that there is for spectroscopy and decays , the study of heavy quark fragmentation is an elegant application of the heavy quark limit in a new regime  @xcite .      the production of a heavy hadron proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , the heavy quark itself must be created ; because of its large mass , this process takes place over a time scale @xmath255 which is very short , @xmath256 .",
    "second , some light degrees of freedom assemble themselves about the heavy quark to make a color neutral heavy hadron , a process which involves nonperturbative strong interactions and typically takes much longer , @xmath257 .",
    "if the heavy quark is produced with a large velocity in the center of mass frame , and if there is plenty of available energy , then production of these light degrees of freedom will be local in phase space and independent of the initial state .",
    "this is the fragmentation regime .",
    "we will see that heavy quark symmetry simplifies the description of heavy hadron production via fragmentation , because , as before , it allows us to separate certain properties of the heavy quark from those of the light degrees of freedom .",
    "this is particularly important in the production of excited heavy hadrons , for which the behavior of the spin of the light degrees of freedom can be quite interesting .",
    "heavy quark symmetry simplifies the picture of fragmentation in several ways .",
    "first , since the fragmentation process involves the exchange only of soft momenta , the velocity @xmath103 of the hadron @xmath18 which is produced is the same as the velocity of the heavy quark @xmath19 .",
    "second , the angular momenta @xmath37 and @xmath44 of the heavy quark and the light degrees of freedom are well defined and can be followed individually through the processes of production and decay .",
    "third , the typical precession time @xmath258 of @xmath37 and @xmath44 about each other is of order @xmath259 , since the precession is induced by the chromomagnetic interaction .",
    "hence @xmath260 , and during the fragmentation process @xmath37 can essentially be taken to be frozen in direction .",
    "suppose that @xmath19 fragments initially to a state with light degrees of freedom with spin @xmath44 .",
    "this could correspond to two possible hadronic states : @xmath18 , with spin @xmath261 , or @xmath262 , with spin @xmath263 .",
    "let the states @xmath264 have lifetime @xmath265 .",
    "how should we treat the interaction of @xmath37 with @xmath44 ?",
    "the answer depends critically on the relationship of @xmath265 to the precession time @xmath258 .",
    "while the order of magnitude of @xmath258 is essentially fixed at @xmath266 , the lifetime @xmath265 can vary widely , depending on the channel in which @xmath264 primarily decays .",
    "of course , if @xmath264 decays weakly , then @xmath267 .",
    "but if @xmath264 decays strongly , then @xmath265 depends critically on the phase space available for the transition . in the absence of phase space factors , @xmath268 .",
    "but since the pion , the lightest hadron , is not massless , it is possible to have a situation where an allowed strong decay is either forbidden by phase space ( as with @xmath269 ) , or severely suppressed ( as with @xmath270 ) .",
    "the treatment of a given hadron doublet depends on the relative size of @xmath265 and @xmath258 .",
    "let us consider the two extreme possibilities .",
    "the first corresponds to a strong decay with plenty of phase space , so @xmath271 . here",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath262 are formed and then decay before the angular momenta @xmath37 and @xmath44 have a chance to interact .",
    "the fact that there is no precession means that there is no change in the orientation of @xmath37 and @xmath44 . if , for example , either spin were polarized before or during the fragmentation process , this polarization would be undisturbed by passing through the resonance @xmath264 .",
    "the strong decay of the heavy hadron then would reflect the orientation of the light degrees as they were produced .",
    "note that it is the very same spin exchange interaction which is inhibited here which is responsible for the splitting @xmath272 between @xmath18 and @xmath262 .",
    "hence , under these conditions the resonances are almost completely _ overlapping , _ with widths @xmath273 satisfying @xmath274 .",
    "this is another consequence of the effective decoupling of @xmath37 and @xmath44 , which are independent good quantum numbers of the resonances .",
    "it also provides a convenient criterion for determining directly whether we are in the regime @xmath271 : we can not distinguish separate resonances for @xmath18 and @xmath262 .",
    "the second possibility is the opposite extreme , @xmath275 .",
    "this corresponds to heavy hadrons which decay weakly or electromagnetically , or to strong decays which are severely suppressed by phase space . here",
    "the spins @xmath37 and @xmath44 have plenty of time to interact , precessing about each other many times before @xmath18 and @xmath262 decay .",
    "there is at least a partial degradation of any initial polarization of @xmath37 , as well as a degradation of any information about the fragmentation process which may be carried by the light degrees of freedom .",
    "the signature of this situation is that the states @xmath18 and @xmath262 are well separated resonances , since the chromomagnetic interactions have ample opportunity to produce a hyperfine splitting much larger than the width , @xmath276 .",
    "in contrast with the first case , here the heavy and light spins are resolved into states of definite total spin @xmath277 .",
    "this resolution destroys information about the individual angular momenta @xmath37 and @xmath44 , and the decays of @xmath18 and @xmath262 only partially reflect the features of the production process .",
    "we will illustrate these ideas with two examples .",
    "the first concerns the production and decay of the excited charmed mesons @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "these are states with light degrees of freedom with angular momentum and parity @xmath280 ; in the quark model , this would correspond to a light antiquark with a unit of orbital angular momentum .",
    "the physical states are the @xmath278 , with mass @xmath281 and width @xmath282 , and the @xmath279 , with mass @xmath283 and width @xmath284 .",
    "the splitting between them is @xmath285 ; although this is not much larger than the individual widths , for simplicity we will treat them in this limiting case @xmath267 .",
    "let us review the sequence of events .",
    "first , the charm quark is created in some hard interaction , with a time scale @xmath286 .",
    "second , light degrees of freedom with @xmath287 are created in a fragmentation process , over a time @xmath288 , forming a color neutral charmed hadron .",
    "third , the angular momenta @xmath289 and @xmath44 precess about each other , resolving the individual @xmath278 and @xmath279 states , which requires a time @xmath290 .",
    "then , finally , after a time @xmath265 greater than @xmath291 , the @xmath278 or @xmath279 emits a pion and decays to a @xmath49 or @xmath50",
    ". one question we might ask about this process is , what is the alignment of the light degrees of freedom produced in the fragmentation ?",
    "of course , the answer depends on nonperturbative qcd and is difficult to calculate from first principles .",
    "still , we can explore the question experimentally .",
    "since the total angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom is @xmath287 , they can be produced with helicity @xmath292 or @xmath293 along the fragmentation axis .",
    "while parity invariance of the strong interactions requires that the probabilities for helicities @xmath294 and @xmath295 are identical , the relative production of light degrees of freedom with @xmath296 versus @xmath297 is determined in some complicated way by nonperturbative dynamics .",
    "let the quantity @xmath298 denote the probability that @xmath299 , w_3/2=p(h=)+p(h=- ) .",
    "then @xmath300 is the probability that @xmath297 .",
    "completely isotropic production corresponds to @xmath301 .",
    "the observable @xmath298 is a new nonperturbative parameter of qcd , which is well defined only in the heavy quark limit .",
    "this new parameter can be measured directly in the strong decay of the @xmath279 or @xmath278 .",
    "for example , consider the angular distribution of the pion with respect to the fragmentation axis in the decay @xmath302 .",
    "this is a decay of the light degrees of freedom in the excited hadron , so it will depend on their initial orientation ( that is , on @xmath298 ) and on the details of the precession of @xmath44 around @xmath37 during the lifetime of the @xmath279 . following the direction of @xmath44 through the sequence of fragmentation , precession and decay , we find the distribution  @xcite [ d2todpi ] 1d= 14 .",
    "this distribution is isotropic only when @xmath303 , that is , when the light degrees of freedom are produced isotropically in the fragmentation process .",
    "similar distributions are found in the decays @xmath304 and @xmath305 .",
    "a fit of argus data  @xcite to the expression ( [ d2todpi ] ) seems to indicate that a small value of @xmath298 is preferred ; while the errors are large , we find that @xmath306 at the 90% confidence level .",
    "it would be nice to confirm this result with a sharper measurement , and not only for the charmed mesons but in the bottom system as well .",
    "since @xmath298 is intrinsically nonperturbative , we do not have any real theoretical understanding of why it should be small , although one can construct a qualitative understanding based on a string picture of fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "the second example springs from a practical question : what is the polarization of @xmath307 baryons produced at the @xmath308 pole ?",
    "this question is motivated by the fact that @xmath4 quarks produced in the decay of the @xmath308 are 94% polarized left - handed .",
    "since the @xmath307 is composed of a @xmath4 quark and light degrees of freedom with @xmath309 , the orientation of a @xmath307 is identical to the orientation of the @xmath4 quark inside it .",
    "similarly , the @xmath4 quark spin does not precess inside a @xmath307 .",
    "hence if a @xmath4 quark produced at the @xmath308 fragments to a @xmath307 , then those baryons should inherit the left - handed polarization of the quarks and reveal it in their weak decay .",
    "unfortunately , life is not that simple .",
    "two recent measurements of @xmath307 polarization @xmath310 from lep are  @xcite & & 0.08^+0.35_-0.29(stat.)^+0.18_-0.16 ( syst . )",
    "+ aleph:&&0.26^+0.20_-0.25(stat.)^+0.12_-0.13 ( syst.),both a long way from @xmath311 .",
    "the reason is that not all @xmath4 quarks which wind up as @xmath307 baryons get there directly .",
    "there is a competing process , in which they fragment first to the excited baryons @xmath312 and @xmath313 , which then decay to @xmath307 via pion emission .",
    "these new states have light degrees of freedom with @xmath314 .",
    "if they have a lifetime @xmath315 , then the @xmath4 quark will have time to precess about @xmath44 and its polarization will be degraded .",
    "the result will be a net sample of @xmath307 s with a polarization less than 94% , as is in fact observed .",
    "in addition to the requirement that @xmath315 for the @xmath316 , any depolarization of @xmath307 s by this mechanism depends on two unknown quantities . first , there is the production rate @xmath317 of @xmath316 relative to @xmath307 .",
    "isospin and spin counting enhance @xmath317 by a factor of nine , while the mass splitting between @xmath316 and @xmath307 suppresses it ; studies based on the lund monte carlo  @xcite indicate @xmath318 with a very large uncertainty .",
    "of course , it would be preferable to measure @xmath317 directly .",
    "second , there is the orientation of the spin @xmath44 with respect to the fragmentation axis .",
    "this orientation , which is nonperturbative in origin , allows the helicities @xmath319 . by analogy with the treatment of the @xmath278 and @xmath279 ,",
    "let us define w_1=p(h=1)+p(h=-1 ) . in this case",

    "if this is confirmed , then a polarization in the range @xmath336 is easy to accommodate . on the other hand , the cleo analysis  @xcite of the decay of the @xmath333 yields @xmath337 , consistent with isotropic fragmentation .",
    "recall that by heavy quark symmetry , @xmath321 measured in the charm and bottom systems must be the same , so this result is inconsistent with the report from delphi .",
    "clearly , further measurements are needed to resolve this situation .",
    "unfortunately , we have had time in these lectures only to introduce a very few of the many applications of heavy quark symmetry and the hqet to the physics of heavy hadrons . since its development less than ten years ago",
    ", it has become one of the basic tools of qcd phenomenology .",
    "much of the popularity and utility of the hqet certainly come from its essential simplicity .",
    "the elementary observation that the physics of heavy hadrons can be divided into interactions characterized by short and long distances gives us immediately a clear and compelling intuition for the properties of heavy - light systems .",
    "the straightforward manipulations which lead to the hqet then allow this intuition to form the basis for a new systematic expansion of qcd . the deeper understanding of heavy hadrons which we thereby obtain will become increasingly important as the end of the second millennium approaches and the @xmath0 factory era begins .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of the summer institute for the opportunity to present these lectures , and for arranging a most interesting and pleasant summer school .",
