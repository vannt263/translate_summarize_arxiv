    "large scale magnetic fields are often considered to be an important factor in accretion disks ( including generation of turbulence ) , crucial in launching winds or jets .",
    "the origin of such large scale magnetic fields in accretion disks is still unclear : they may be advected from the surrounding medium or be generated by a dynamo inside the disk .",
    "advection appears unlikely as turbulence leads to enhanced viscosity and magnetic diffusivity , so that the two are of the same order , i.e. the magnetic prandtl number is of order unity @xcite . in this case",
    "the turbulent magnetic diffusivity can compensate the dragging of the field by viscously induced accretion flow @xcite .",
    "turbulent dynamo action is a plausible mechanism for producing large scale magnetic fields in accretion disks @xcite .",
    "dynamo magnetic fields can launch winds from accretion disks @xcite .",
    "however , the wind can also affect the dynamo .",
    "in particular , a dynamo enhancement by winds was suggested earlier for galactic dynamos @xcite . in the same context",
    "the effects of shear in the vertical velocity on the dynamo was considered @xcite .",
    "we assume here that the magnetic fields are generated by a dynamo acting in a relatively thin accretion disk .",
    "we show how vertical flow can enhance the dynamo , allowing for a larger growth rate and leading to super - exponential growth of the magnetic field and to enhanced saturation levels of magnetic energy .",
    "the vertical velocities can have several origins .",
    "for example , they can be due to a thermally driven wind emanating from the disk or magnetic buoyancy in the disk .",
    "note that here we invoke magnetic buoyancy as a driver of vertical outflows ; it can itself contribute to the dynamo effect @xcite , but such effects are not taken into account here .",
    "the equation which we solve is the mean - field induction equation which we evolve in terms of the vector potential @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the current density , @xmath4 the magnetic permeability , @xmath5 the turbulent magnetic diffusivity , @xmath6 the @xmath6-effect and @xmath7 the mean velocity .",
    "we neglect the radial component of the mean velocity . assuming the @xmath6- and @xmath5-tensors to be isotropic",
    ", we can consider scalar quantities .",
    "we do not make the thin - disk approximation but solve the general equations .",
    "we adopt cylindrical coordinates @xmath8 and restrict ourselves to axisymmetric solutions .",
    "equation  ( [ eqa ] ) is solved using a sixth order finite - difference scheme in space and a third order runge - kutta time advance scheme .",
    "our computational domain contains a disk embedded in its surrounding halo .",
    "we take a disk aspect ratio of @xmath9 and a halo with @xmath10 .    as an initial condition for the magnetic field we choose a purely poloidal field in the disk of either dipolar or quadrupolar symmetry .    on the boundaries of the computational domain we impose pseudo - vacuum conditions .",
    "however , since the boundaries are in the halo far away from the disk , the choice of boundary conditions is not crucial .",
    "the @xmath6-coefficient @xmath11 is antisymmetric about the disk midplane and vanishes outside the disk .",
    "we adopt @xmath12 the @xmath13-profile cuts off the @xmath6-effect at the outer radius of the disk as well as at an inner radius , where the rotational shear is very strong .    as appropriate for accretion disks ,",
    "we adopt a softened keplerian angular velocity profile in @xmath14 in the disk as well as the halo , @xmath15^{-{n+1 \\over 2n}},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is newton s gravitational constant , @xmath17 is the mass of the central object , @xmath18 is the softening radius , and @xmath19 . at @xmath20 , @xmath21 vanishes .    the turbulent magnetic diffusivity is given by @xmath22 the profile @xmath23 defines the disk : @xmath24 is equal to unity inside the disk and vanishes in the halo but with a smooth transition between .",
    "we carried out computations for two cases : homogeneous conductivity , @xmath25 , and low conductivity in the halo , @xmath26 .",
    "the profile for @xmath27 is linear in @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a characteristic vertical velocity .",
    "our dynamo problem is controlled by the three magnetic reynolds numbers related to the @xmath6-effect , the differential rotation and the vertical velocity , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the rotational shear .",
    "the dynamo number is defined as @xmath33 .",
    "since the dynamo number is approximately constant , @xmath34 in thin accretion disks @xcite , we assume @xmath35 to be constant by setting @xmath36 .    because of the strong differential rotation we assume that the magnetic field in the disk is generated by a standard @xmath37-dynamo .",
    "the two control parameters are then the dynamo number @xmath38 and the vertical magnetic reynolds number @xmath39 .",
    "the value of @xmath39 obviously depends on the origin of the vertical outflow . with magnetic buoyancy ,",
    "a rough estimate can be done assuming that the vertical velocities are comparable to the alfvn speed . estimating the alfvn speed from magnetic equipartition , one gets a vertical magnetic reynolds number @xmath39 of order unity .",
    "for @xmath41 , the growth rates of dipolar and quadrupolar modes should be exchanged when @xmath35 reverses sign , i.e. the graph of @xmath42 as a function of @xmath35 should be symmetric with respect to the vertical axis @xmath43 with quadrupolar and dipolar modes exchanging their rles @xcite .",
    "our numerical simulation shows this symmetry with a good precision ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "this is because the ratio between @xmath44 and @xmath45 is large enough , about 6 .    for @xmath46 ( @xmath47 )",
    "the first leading growing mode is quadrupolar whereas for @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) it is dipolar ; both are non - oscillatory .",
    "we thus study the effect of vertical velocities for @xmath46 in quadrupolar and for @xmath48 in dipolar symmetry at dynamo numbers up to @xmath50 .    for @xmath51 ,",
    "the critical dynamo number is @xmath52 .",
    "the dominant mode changes its symmetry and becomes oscillatory at @xmath53 .",
    "the qualitative behaviour in the case of low conductivity in the halo is quite similar to that of homogeneous conductivity .",
    "also the quadrupolar non - oscillatory modes first become dominant for @xmath47 and the dipolar non - oscillatory modes for @xmath49 ( compare figs .  [ fig1]a and b ) .",
    "but there are quantitative differences .",
    "the value of @xmath54 , where the symmetry of the leading mode changes , is larger than @xmath55 . also , the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b is not symmetric .",
    "the critical dynamo number is @xmath56 for quadrupolar ( dipolar ) modes .",
    "as discussed in section 3 , we only consider quadrupolar symmetry for @xmath46 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the growth rate of the magnetic field @xmath57 is a non - monotonous function of @xmath39 , for @xmath58 equal to both @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "a maximum in @xmath57 occurs , however , only for @xmath54 large enough , and the smaller the magnetic diffusivity of the halo , the smaller is the required @xmath54 .",
    "the larger @xmath54 , the more pronounced is the maximum .",
    "the maximum growth rate occurs for @xmath39 of the order of @xmath59 to @xmath61 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the effect of the dynamo number and the vertical velocity on the magnetic field configuration for @xmath62 .",
    "increasing @xmath54 from @xmath63 to @xmath64 in the absence of any vertical velocity results in the magnetic field becoming concentrated at larger radii in the disk ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a and b ) .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b , c and d , a vertical velocity with @xmath65 leads to a wider vertical distribution of magnetic field which reduces magnetic diffusion and enhances the dynamo action . at still larger @xmath39",
    ", the wind aligns the poloidal field lines with the lines of constant rotation , and the @xmath21-effect is slowly switched off leading to a decrease in the growth rate , which eventually becomes negative .",
    "the mode structures at a maximum of re(@xmath66 ) , reached at @xmath67 for @xmath68 ) and @xmath69 for @xmath70 , are very similar to each other .",
    "the growth rate for dipolar non - oscillatory modes ( @xmath48 ) has no maximum as @xmath39 increases ; at @xmath39 of order @xmath59 or even less the dynamo is switched off .",
    "the magnetic field is advected outwards and aligned with the @xmath21-contour lines in vertical direction very quickly .",
    "we consider nonlinear , saturated solutions in a model with homogeneous conductivity , @xmath71 , negative dynamo number and quadrupolar symmetry ( the dominant symmetry for moderate @xmath54 with @xmath40 ) .",
    "all saturated magnetic fields are non - oscillatory , as the corresponding linear modes .",
    "we parameterize the effect of magnetic buoyancy by assuming the vertical velocity to be proportional to the maximum magnetic field strength .",
    "thus , the vertical magnetic reynolds number becomes time - dependent , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a characteristic field strength .",
    "as time increases , @xmath74 grows and therefore @xmath39 is increasing and the growth rate follows , e.g. , the upper curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a for @xmath68 .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath39 is less than the position of the @xmath66-maximum , @xmath66 increases with time , which results in a super - exponential growth . after the maximum , at @xmath67 , @xmath66 decreases and eventually the magnetic field approaches its saturation level",
    "this is reached when @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the zero of @xmath77 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ rel ] ) , the saturation value of magnetic energy will thus be @xmath78 .",
    "we consider the back - reaction of the magnetic field on the @xmath6-effect , introducing the nonlinearity @xmath79 as a factor in the @xmath6-effect ; @xmath80 is the equipartition field .",
    "the magnetic energy has a maximum at a certain value of @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ fig911 ] , left ) , but this maximum occurs at @xmath81 , a value smaller than where a maximum of re(@xmath66 ) occurs in the linear regime , and it is also less pronounced . the value of @xmath39 where the maximum occurs , is independent of @xmath82 . the magnetic energy scales roughly with the dynamo number , @xmath83 .    the effect of vertical velocity on the magnetic field for the model with @xmath6-quenching is shown in fig .  [ fig10 ] ; the structure changes only weakly with the dynamo number . with increasing @xmath39",
    "the poloidal field lines become vertical , i.e. aligned with the lines of constant rotation . hence",
    ", shear has no effect , and the @xmath21-effect is switched off , as in the linear model .",
    "when @xmath6-quenching and magnetic buoyancy are combined , the vertical magnetic reynolds number depends on position and time and takes the form @xmath84 . without @xmath6-quenching ,",
    "since @xmath39 is now nonlocal , the temporal behaviour of the growth rates at short times does not have to be super - exponential .",
    "surprisingly , again we find @xmath78 ( see fig",
    ".  [ fig911 ] , right , dashed line ) .    in the second panel of fig .",
    "[ fig911 ] magnetic energy is plotted against @xmath39 for @xmath70 for the three nonlinear models .",
    "@xmath6-quenching appears to be the dominant nonlinearity in the model considered .",
