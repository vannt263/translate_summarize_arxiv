    "we consider nonlinear vibrations in hamiltonian systems .",
    "conventional , or linear normal modes ( lnms ) are exact solutions of dynamical equations in the harmonic approximation  @xcite .",
    "this approximation means , that potential energy of the considered system is decomposed into multi - dimensional taylor series , and only quadratic terms are taken into account for obtaining newton classical equations .",
    "lnms cease to be exact solutions when we involve not only quadratic , but also some anharmonic terms . if the latter terms are sufficiently small , then it is possible to speak about some interactions between lnms . in many physical problems ,",
    "such interactions and the role of different anharmonic terms are studied .",
    "taking into account the smallness of these terms , we can construct some _ approximate _",
    "solutions for the considered nonlinear problem . as an example",
    "let us refer to studying the various types of the phonon - phonon interactions in crystal physics  @xcite",
    ".    in this connection one can ask , are there exist some _ exact _ solutions of nonlinear dynamical equations beyond harmonic approximation ?    let we have a nonlinear system whose potential energy contains besides quadratic terms ( therefore , the system admits the harmonic approximation ) some anharmonic terms preceded by a common factor @xmath1 .",
    "this parameter determines the strength of nonlinearity of the system .",
    "lyapunov proved  @xcite that each lnm can be continued in @xmath1 to obtain an exact periodic solution of the nonlinear system .",
    "he also gave a procedure to construct this exact solution up to arbitrary degree of the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "as a result , one can find the set of @xmath2 lyapunov nonlinear normal modes ( nnms ) , where @xmath2 is the dimension of the system .",
    "unfortunately , the procedure of lyapunov nnms constructing is very cumbersome , and we can obtain solutions only up to a small degree of the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , this procedure usually converges only for very small values @xmath1 .",
    "these factors prevent to use the lyapunov modes in many physical problems .",
    "another notion of nonlinear normal modes was introduced by rosenberg  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "these modes can exist for large values of the parameter @xmath1 and even for the essentially nonlinear systems whose potential energy does not contain any quadratic terms ( such systems do nt admit the harmonic approximation ) .",
    "the number of nnms by rosenberg , if they exist , can be less or even greater than the full number of the system s degrees of freedom .",
    "unfortunately , rosenberg modes can exist only in very specific nonlinear systems .",
    "let us consider this point in more detail for n - degrees - of - freedom mechanical system . according to definition , in the dynamical regime described by a given rosenberg mode , all degrees of freedom , @xmath3 , vibrate as follows : @xmath4 thus , all @xmath3 at any moment t are proportional to the _ same _ time - dependent function @xmath5 ( @xmath6 are constant coefficients )",
    "actually , this means a separation of space and time variables .",
    "substitution of the ansatz   into differential equations of the dynamical system leads to the set of @xmath7 algebraic equations for obtaining amplitudes @xmath6 and to one differential equation which determines time - periodic function @xmath5 .",
    "the latter equation is called `` governing '' .",
    "rosenberg found several classes of mechanical systems for which eq .",
    "is fulfilled .",
    "the most important class is formed by systems whose potential energy is a homogeneous function , of arbitrary degree , of all its arguments .    in  @xcite",
    ", we have shown that existence of rosenberg nonlinear normal modes can be a direct consequence of a certain discrete symmetry of the considered physical system .",
    "we refer to such modes as symmetry - determined nonlinear normal modes ( sd - nnms ) .",
    "hereafter only this type of rosenberg modes is considered .    in  @xcite",
    ", we have also introduced the concept of _ bushes of nnms _ for dynamical systems described by arbitrary group @xmath8 of discrete symmetry .",
    "every bush possesses a certain symmetry group @xmath9 which is a subgroup of the group @xmath8 ( @xmath10 ) and represents an _ exact _ solution of nonlinear dynamical equations . as a consequence , the energy of initial excitation of a given bush turns out to be trapped in this dynamical object until it loses its stability ( then the bush transforms into another bush of lower symmetry and larger dimension ) .",
    "every bush whose dimension @xmath11 is greater than unity ( @xmath12 ) describes a _ quasiperiodic _ dynamical regime which is determined by @xmath11 governing differential equations . in this sense",
    ", one can consider the rosenberg mode as one - dimensional bush .",
    "the specific group - theoretical methods for constructing bushes of nnms were developed in  @xcite .",
    "it is essential that because of symmetry - related causes only a finite number of the bushes of each dimension can exist in the physical system with a given symmetry group  @xmath8 .",
    "for example , it was found  @xcite that for monoatomic chain with even interparticle interactions and periodic boundary conditions ( such as fpu-@xmath13 chain or electrical chain , considered in  @xcite ) only five sd - nnms can exist ( depending on the number of particles in the chain ) .",
    "all bushes of low dimensions for many mechanical structures with various types of translational and point symmetry were found in  @xcite . in particular , in  @xcite , all sd - nnms ( one - dimensional bushes ) were found for all possible mechanical structures with any of @xmath14 space symmetry groups .    note that construction of bushes can be done _ without _ any information about the type of interparticle interactions in the given physical system .",
    "one must know only its symmetry group and the geometrical structure .",
    "searching for the complete set of modes entering the bush with a given symmetry , we deal with its geometrical aspect .",

    ", we deal with dynamical aspect of the bush when study time - evolution of its modes and the bush stability . in this stage of bush studying , we must know specific interactions between particles of the physical system .    in  @xcite , we have studied geometrical and dynamical properties of one- , two- and three - dimensional bushes in a simple octahedral mechanical system which is depicted in fig .",
    "it represents a regular octahedron with equal point masses at the vertices and with another point mass in its center .",
    "it was found , that @xmath15 bushes of vibrational modes can exist in the case when the central particle is immovable . among these bushes",
    "there are @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 bushes with point symmetry groups @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "these bushes were studied in  @xcite not only as geometrical objects , but also as dynamical objects supposing that interparticle interactions in the considered system are described by arbitrary pair potential , @xmath22 , in particular , by the lennard - jones potential @xmath23    naturally , one can ask : `` are there exist some physical systems whose nonlinear dynamics can be described by the above simple mechanical model ? ''",
    "the more general question can be formulated as follows : `` can the concept of bushes of nonlinear normal modes and the methods of their studying be valid for nonlinear dynamics of _ real physical systems _ ? ''",
    "first of all , let us note that there are some molecules , whose equilibrium state corresponds to the mechanical model in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as an example",
    ", we choose the molecule @xmath0 .",
    "the experimental investigation of nonlinear vibrations of such molecules represents great difficulties ( see , for example , review paper  @xcite devoted to study interactions between normal modes in simple molecules ) .",
    "on the other hand , the ab initio calculations based on the density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite , proved to be very effective and rather correct for studying molecules and crystals .",
    "indeed , dft allows to determine the geometrical structures of many microscopic objects up to @xmath24 accuracy  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is very interesting to study nonlinear dynamics in the framework of dft methods . in our recent paper  @xcite , we successfully realized such a program for studying discrete breathers in graphane .",
    "we found there that dft leads to cardinally different results for vibrations with large amplitudes than the methods of molecular dynamics based on the concept of mass points interacting via a widely used phenomenological pair potential .",
    "indeed , the mass - point models can not describe the complicated process of the polarisation of the atomic shell during essentially nonlinear vibration . in  @xcite ,",
    "the brenner potential  @xcite was used for studying discrete breathers and the non - monotonic connection @xmath25 between breather amplitude @xmath26 and its frequency @xmath27 was obtained ( it shows two changes between soft and hard nonlinearity ) .",
    "in contrast , with the aid of abinit package  @xcite , we have obtained the monotonic function @xmath25 , which demonstrates that only soft nonlinearity takes place for gap breathers in graphane .    in this paper",
    ", we study nonlinear dynamics of @xmath0 by dft methods realized in abinit code  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2 , the geometrical aspects of nonlinear vibrations of @xmath0 corresponding to the bushes with point symmetry groups @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 are discussed .",
    "is devoted to ab initio calculations of the dynamics of the above bushes . in sec .  4",
    ", we comment on the validity of the bushes of the nonlinear normal modes in real nonlinear systems ( using @xmath0 molecule as an example ) and discuss further possible investigations of nonlinear dynamics of physical systems in the framework of dft .",
    "group - theoretical analysis of nonlinear vibrations of the structure presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] was already fulfilled in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we reproduce some results of that work which are necessary for the further discussion .    in any vibrational regime ,",
    "the nuclei of the atoms , consisting the @xmath0 molecule , displace from the equilibrium positions depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and we can speak about a displacement pattern at any fixed moment @xmath28 . for every nnm , as well as for lnm , this pattern possesses a certain point symmetry group . in the conventional phonon - spectrum analysis ( this is the case of small vibrations ) ,",
    "the above patterns are determined by eigenvectors of the matrix of force constants .",
    "there exists wigner theorem  @xcite about group - theoretical classification of the linear normal modes . according to this theorem ,",
    "the modes are classified by _ irreducible representations _ ( irreps ) of the symmetry group @xmath8 of the system in equilibrium . in this way",
    ", we can introduce the basis @xmath29 in the space of all possible atomic displacements , constituted by the complete set of basis vectors of the irreps entering into the mechanical representation of the considered system .",
    "therefore , any vibrational regime @xmath30 in this system can be decomposed into the above basis with coefficients depending on time  @xmath28 : @xmath31 in this equation , each term @xmath32 can be considered as nonlinear normal mode according to the definition  .",
    "indeed , the vector multiplier @xmath33 determines the displacement pattern of all atoms , i.e.  the space structure of nnm , while @xmath34 determines time - evolution of the mode .",
    "however , for brevity , we often use the term nonlinear normal mode ( or vibrational mode ) individually for @xmath33 , as well as for @xmath34 .",
    "the basis vectors @xmath33 correspond to different irreps @xmath35 of the group @xmath8 and , therefore , the displacement vector @xmath36 in   can be written as the sum of contributions associated with individual representations of the equilibrium symmetry group @xmath8 : @xmath37).\\ ] ] here , @xmath38 $ ] is the set of basis vectors of the irrep @xmath35 .    according to wigner theorem , the _ small _ vibrations of the molecule associated with the different irreducible representations @xmath35 are _ independent from each other_. it means that if one excite ( by using the appropriate initial conditions when solving linear differential equations ) a dynamical regime @xmath36 corresponding to a given irrep @xmath35 , this regime can never leads to excitation of the modes belonging to another irreps in the decomposition",
    ". therefore , one can ask : `` what will happen if we consider large and , therefore , _ nonlinear _ vibrations of the molecule ? ''",
    "the theory of the bushes of nonlinear normal modes starts from this question .",
    "the answer was given in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite , devoted to discussion of the bush theory ) .",
    "it turns out that there exist certain _ selection rules _ for excitation transfer from one mode to another .",
    "these rules are originate from some group - theoretical restrictions which can be written as a certain system of linear algebraic equations  @xcite .",
    "in particular , one can deduce from this system that excitation from the mode with the given symmetry group @xmath9 can transfer only to those nonlinear normal modes whose own symmetry is _ higher _ or _ equal _ to @xmath9 .",
    "the above selection rules lead to possibility for existence of bushes of nnms .",
    "each bush represents a set of nnms that conserves the energy of initial excitation until it loses stability because of the phenomenon similar to the parametric resonance with some modes outside a given bush .",
    "this phenomenon occurs if amplitudes of some bush modes attain sufficiently large values ( see details in  @xcite ) .",
    "every bush possesses its own symmetry that is determined by intersection of all symmetry groups of its modes .",
    "as was already mentioned , when the given bush loses stability , it transforms into another bush with lower symmetry and with higher dimension .",
    "let us consider the simplest bushes for nonlinear vibrations of @xmath0 molecule using some results obtained in  @xcite . in the equilibrium state , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the molecule @xmath0 possesses point symmetry group @xmath39 .",
    "all vibrational modes for this molecule , classified by irreps of the group @xmath19 , can be found in table .  3 in  @xcite",
    "[ three translational modes must be excluded since the central atom ( @xmath40 ) is supposed to be immovable ] .    for the present consideration",
    ", we need explicit forms of the displacement patterns of nnms @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , corresponding to one - dimensional irrep @xmath44 , two - dimensional irrep @xmath45 and three - dimensional irreps @xmath46 .",
    "these displacement patterns are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "[ table1 ]    .displacement patterns of the nnms in @xmath0 molecule [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this table , for each fluorine atom , according to the numbering in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we point out three coordinates @xmath47 , which determines displacement of the nucleus of this atom from the equilibrium position .",
    "one can see from table 1 that the molecule shape in the vibrational regime , corresponding to the mode @xmath41 represents , at _ any _ moment @xmath28 , the regular octahedron .",
    "its size vibrates in time becoming larger or lesser in comparison with the octahedron corresponding to the equilibrium state .",
    "this nnm is called `` breathing '' mode .",
    "it represents one - dimensional bush with symmetry group @xmath19 .",
    "the symmetry group of the breathing mode , @xmath19 , is higher than that of each other vibrational mode and , therefore , according to the above mentioned selection rules , the excitation from this mode can not transfer to another modes .",
    "therefore , the breathing mode will vibrate for arbitrary long time without involving into the dynamical regime any other vibrational modes .",
    "in other words , if we decompose @xmath36 for the breathing mode in accordance with the eq .  , we obtain that right - hand side of this equation is reduced to one term only @xmath48 here we have renamed the time - dependent coefficient @xmath49 as @xmath50 .",
    "this means that breathing mode represents an _ exact _ solution to the nonlinear differential equations describing dynamics of our mechanical system for _ any type _ of interatomic interactions .",
    "the explicit form of the differential equation for the time - dependent coefficient @xmath50 can be found if one substitute eq .   into the full original system of @xmath51 nonlinear equations ( remember that the central atom is immovable ) taking into account the specific type of interatomic forces . in this way",
    ", we reveal that the above system of @xmath15 equations is reduced to only one differential equation for @xmath50 .",
    "let us emphasize that @xmath50 indeed depends on interatomic forces , while the displacement pattern _ does not depend _ on these forces and can be found with the aid of the group - theoretical method only ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "thus , the breathing mode represents one - dimensional bush with symmetry group @xmath19 and we denote it by symbol @xmath52 $ ] . in  @xcite , one can find an explicit form of the differential equation for @xmath50 in the case of arbitrary pair interatomic potential @xmath22 , as well as for lennard - jones potential .",
    "another situation appears when we excite the mode @xmath42 by displacing fluorine atoms according to its pattern given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the own point symmetry of this mode is described by the point group @xmath53 that is a subgroup of the equilibrium state symmetry group @xmath39 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "displacement pattern associated with @xmath42 represents octahedron with square base , formed by atoms @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , and the atoms @xmath59 , @xmath60 situated on @xmath61 axis and displaced by the same distance from their equilibrium positions from the octahedron base . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we depict the above displacements of all six @xmath62 atoms by arrows .",
    "in contrast to the case of excitation of the breathing mode , in the present case , the mode @xmath42 can not exist independently of all other modes .",
    "indeed , its excitation leads to excitation of the breathing mode @xmath41 whose symmetry group @xmath63 is higher than the symmetry group @xmath53 .",
    "this conclusion is a result of the group - theoretical analysis only .",
    "thus , we obtain the two - dimensional bush @xmath64 $ ] with the point group @xmath53 . from the general decomposition  ,",
    "we obtain for this case : @xmath65 here we have renamed @xmath49 and @xmath66 by @xmath50 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "substitution of the anzats ( @xmath60 ) into @xmath15 original nonlinear equations confirms that all these equations are transformed into two differential equations with respect to the unknown coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath67 .",
    "these two time - dependent functions fully describe the dynamics of the two - dimensional bush @xmath64 $ ] in eq .",

    "let us emphasize once more that _ no other modes _ present in the decomposition  , i.e.  eq .   represents an _ exact _ solution of the original nonlinear equations whose coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 can be obtain as solution of two governing differential equations depending on the specific interatomic interactions . in  @xcite",
    ", we presented the explicit expressions of these governing equations for the case of arbitrary pair potential @xmath22 and , in particular , for the lennard - jones potential .",
    "let us note that in the vibrational regime described by the bush @xmath64 $ ] the atom configuration represents the octahedron with square base and with atoms @xmath59 and @xmath60 displaced by the same distance in opposite directions ( this is a consequence of the presence in the group @xmath20 horizontal mirror plane determined by the base of octahedron ) .",

    "bush @xmath75 $ ] whose full symmetry coincides with the group @xmath76 of the mode @xmath43 .    the modes whose symmetry determines the symmetry of the whole bush we call `` root modes '' , while other modes which turns out to be excited automatically as a result of the root mode excitation we call `` secondary modes '' .",
    "let us note , that in general the situation can be more complicated",
    ". indeed , even for the original group @xmath39 there exist bushes whose excitation is possible only by exciting _ simultaneously _ several modes with different symmetry groups . in this case",
    "the symmetry of the whole bush is determined by _ intersection _ of the above symmetry groups .",
    "all nontrivial bushes of different dimensions ( up to dimension equal to @xmath77 ) were presented in  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the group @xmath53 , the horizontal mirror plane is absent in the group @xmath76 . as a consequence , displacements of the fluorine atoms @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    "need not to be equal in magnitude and , therefore , the octahedron corresponding to the bush @xmath75 $ ] possesses different heights dropped from the atoms @xmath59 and @xmath60 to the octahedron base formed by the atoms @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ,  @xmath58 .",

    "substitution of the anzats   into the original @xmath15 nonlinear differential equations leads to three governing equations ( all other original equations turn out to be equivalent to these governing equations ) whose explicit form , for the case of pair potential @xmath22 , are given in  @xcite .",
    "for all above - discussed bushes , the symmetry of the _ vibrational state _ conserve , as well as the complete set of the bush modes , while amplitudes of these modes [ they are described by coefficients @xmath81 in eqs .  , , ] evaluate in time .",

    "the existence of these bushes was _ confirmed _ by straightforward numerical experiments using lennard - jones and morse potentials .",
    "however , there is a principle question : `` can these bushes exist in real physical systems ? '' indeed , during nonlinear vibrations of real atoms their electron shells polarized and it is not obvious that we can describe the complex physical process of such polarization ( characterized by many degrees of freedom ! ) by simple mechanical mass - point models with pair potential interactions .",
    "there is a necessity to verify validity of the concept of bushes of nonlinear normal modes and our group - theoretical methods , aimed at constructing bushes , using real physical experiments .",
    "unfortunately , such direct experiments , as to the best of our knowledge , can not be fulfilled with the aid of the present experimental technique .",

    "moreover , dynamics of the secondary mode is radically different from the simple sinusoidal oscillations , and this difference becomes more visible with increasing amplitude of the root mode .",
    "the main point is that excitation from the root mode is transferred to only one of all other modes , and exactly to the mode which must be excited in accordance with the bush theory ( excitation can be transferred only to the modes with higher or equal symmetry ) .    in our case ,",
