    "there is strong evidence that type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs ( co - wds ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is widely thought that the explosion is caused by accretion of matter onto the co - wd , and as it approaches the unstable chandrasekhar mass limit of @xmath5 , a poorly understood mechanism causes the required explosion ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . in these models ,",
    "the uncertainties in the burning waves allow the introduction of free parameters ( such as the deflagration velocity or transition to detonation criteria ) , tuned to account for the observations .",
    "it was recently shown that the rate of head - on collisions of typical field wds in triple systems may be as high as that of sne ia ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see , however , @xcite ) , and it was suggested that some or all sne ia are due to such collisions .",
    "here we provide evidence supporting a scenario in which the majority of sne ia are the result of such head - on collisions of co - wds . in this case",
    "the nuclear detonation is due to a well understood shock ignition , devoid of the commonly introduced free parameters , and unrelated to the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "collisions of wds were previously suggested to occur mainly in dense stellar systems .",
    "while such collisions are believed to have rates which are orders of magnitude smaller than the rate of sne ia , they motivated three - dimensional ( 3d ) hydrodynamic simulations of the thermonuclear explosion of colliding wds @xcite .",
    "while the amount of @xmath1ni ( the decay of which powers the observed light ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) synthesized in most of these simulations was non - negligible , some results were contradictory , with inconsistent amounts of @xmath1ni and different ignition sites for the same initial conditions .",
    "section  [ sec : numerical ] describes our simulations of zero - impact - parameter co - wd collisions , which fully resolve the ignition process . in section  [ sec : previous ] , we compare our results to previous works , resolving previous discrepancies .",
    "section  [ sec : observations ] discusses several observational tests , which avoid radiation transfer uncertainties , and which demonstrate the consistency of our models with the majority of sne ia .",
    "section  [ sec : future ] presents avenues for future research .",
    "we consider the collisions of ( equal and non - equal mass ) co - wds with masses 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.9 , 1.0@xmath6 , covering the range of co - wd masses .",
    "this problem is axisymmetric , allowing the use of two - dimensional ( 2d ) numerical simulations with high resolution ( @xmath7few km cell size ) , which is higher by at least an order of magnitude than those in previous eulerian approaches ( limited to @xmath8 km cell sizes ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and smooth particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in which the resolution is estimated from the  cell volume ",
    ", corresponds to particle mass divided by the density ) .",
    "we employ two different hydrodynamic codes : flash4.0 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eulerian , adaptive mesh refinement ) and vulcan2d ( * ? ? ?",
    "* arbitrary eulerian - lagrangian , ale ) .",
    "flash4.0 solves the equations of reactive hydrodynamics by combining the dimensionally - split piecewise parabolic method @xcite with a 19 isotope alpha - chain reaction network @xcite .",
    "the system of equations is closed with the helmholtz equation of state @xcite and a multipole gravity solver .",
    "vulcan2d solves the reactive hydrodynamic equations on an ale grids using a lagrangian step followed by a remapping step on a new grid with a 13 isotope alpha - chain reaction network .",
    "we exploit the flexibility of the grid to refine it near the collision interface , so that at the onset of a detonation a maximal , pre - determined resolution is reached there .",
    "the equation of state , gravity solver and boundary conditions are similar to those used in flash4.0 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we present the flash4.0 results .",
    "initially the co - wds are at contact with free fall velocities .",
    "the structure of each co - wd is obtained from an isothermal stellar model at @xmath9  k and with a uniform composition of @xmath10 carbon and @xmath10 oxygen by mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : ignition 2d ] shows an example of the ignition process and the ejecta formation for a @xmath11 collision . for this case we verified that placing the co - wds with a separation of 4 stellar radii between their centers has a minor effect ( a few percent ) on our results .",
    "we used vulcan2d to evolve several cases , and found the same @xmath1ni mass and the same location of the detonation ignition ( see , e.g. , the right panel of figure  [ fig:1d and conv ] ) . in both codes , collisions involving co - wds with mass @xmath12 ignite at the shock region ( as in figure  [ fig : ignition 2d ] ) , while higher mass co - wds ignite at the contact region .",
    "the shocked region at the vicinity of the symmetry axis has approximate planar symmetry ( see , e.g. , panel ( c ) of figure  [ fig : ignition 2d ] ) .",
    "this allowed us to develop a one - dimensional ( 1d ) planar model ( evolved with lagrangian and eulerian schemes ) to ensure that 2d simulations correctly resolve the ignition process ( panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig:1d and conv ] ) .",
    "the initial co - wd density of the 1d model equals the density on the axis of symmetry in the 2d model , and the initial velocity is the free fall velocity",
    ". the gravitational field is mimicked by an adjustable acceleration , which is constant in time and space .",
    "for example , the acceleration @xmath13 , approximately reproduces the 2d velocity profiles of the @xmath11 collision in figure  [ fig : ignition 2d ] , and results in a similar location of the ignition ( @xmath14 from the contact surface ) .",
    "in particular , this suggests that the curvature of the shock has little effect on the ignition process . by artificially changing the acceleration",
    "we verify the robustness of the correct ignition location . only for a substantially higher value of the acceleration @xmath15",
    "does the detonation occur at the contact region .",
    "numerically unstable burning occurs if the energy in a cell is significantly increased in a time shorter than the sound crossing time , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the length scale of the cell and @xmath18 is the sound speed .",
    "this is a severe problem for eulerian calculations with cell sizes larger than @xmath19 .",
    "stability is achieved by limiting the energy injection rate from burning to @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the internal energy of the cell and * @xmath22*. this is implemented in all of our simulations by appropriate renormalization of all burning rates within a cell if the limit is exceeded . as the numerical resolution increases , the renormalization becomes less severe , guaranteeing correct convergence while avoiding premature ignition .",
    "the limiter does not modify the ignition of a detonation wave process , which is set at lower temperatures , where the stability criterion is automatically satisfied . by comparing the 1d eulerian model with resolution @xmath23 to a converged 1d lagrangian model",
    ", we verify that the limiter does nt affect the ignition and burning for @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , we adopted @xmath25 in our simulations . in several cases",
    "we find that if the limiter is not used , a premature numerical ignition may occur ( see , e.g. , left panel of figure  [ fig:1d and conv ] ) .",
    "the amount of @xmath1ni synthesized in the various collisions is shown in figure  [ fig : nimass ] ( and is given in table  1 ) , which is the main result of this letter .",
    "we find that co - wd collisions lead to the synthesis of @xmath26 of @xmath1ni , covering the range of yields observed in the vast majority of sne ia ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fig : nebular_vmod_ni56 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , there is a tight correlation between the @xmath1ni yields and the total mass of the colliding co - wd masses , which is insensitive to their mass ratio .",
    "for equal mass collisions , similar @xmath1ni yields were obtained by most of the sph simulations of @xcite and of @xcite ( except for the @xmath27 collision , for which both groups obtained a negligible amount of @xmath1ni ) , and significantly lower yields ( by factor of @xmath28 ) were obtained by flash calculations of the same groups @xcite . however , most non - equal mass sph results contradict ours .",
    "four such simulations exist , and three of them ( the @xmath29 collision of @xcite and the @xmath30 and @xmath31 collisions of @xcite ) have lower @xmath1ni yields than ours by factors of a few up to orders of magnitude . as a result ,",
    "the tight correlation between the @xmath1ni yields and the total mass of the colliding co - wd masses was not seen in any of the previous works .",
    "we reproduce the low @xmath1ni yields of the discrepant simulations by running simulations with similarly low resolutions .",
    "we are able to identify the main cause for the discrepancy in most cases . in a @xmath11 simulation with a similar setup as in @xcite ,",
    "a premature ignition occurs at the contact region that prevents the correct shock ignition at later times .",
    "this occurs mainly due to the fact that @xcite did not implement the required burning limiter to avoid numerical unstable burning ( see section  [ sec : numerical ] ) .",
    "we also performed @xmath27 , @xmath30 , and @xmath29 simulations with similar resolutions to the cell volumes of the sph simulations .",
    "we find that the propagation of the detonation wave is significantly altered due to the low resolution .",
    "for example , in our high - resolution @xmath30 simulation , following ignition in the @xmath32 star , the detonation wave propagates inside the @xmath32 star in the @xmath33-direction up to a height of @xmath34 from the symmetry axis , and then crosses into the @xmath35 star .",
    "however , the detonation crossing , which is responsible for the large amount of @xmath1ni ( @xmath36 ) , is not resolved by @xcite , in which the resolution is lower than our high - resolution runs by a factor of @xmath37 in the crossing location ( density of @xmath38 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the low - resolution runs obtain small amounts of @xmath1ni . given that similar dynamics are observed in our @xmath39 collision , we suspect that the low @xmath1ni yield obtained for the @xmath31 collision of @xcite is due to the same reason .",
    "the amount of @xmath1ni obtained in our simulations ( figure  [ fig : nimass ] ) , implies that collisions of typical co - wds in the mass range @xmath0 produce @xmath1ni masses in the range @xmath40 in agreement with the inferred range of sne ia ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fig : nebular_vmod_ni56 ] ) .",
    "the tight correlation between the @xmath1ni yields and the total mass of the colliding co - wd masses , which is insensitive to their mass ratio , may explain the fact that many of the sne ia properties are tightly correlated .",
    "one constraint for explosion models is the observed substantial amount of high - velocity intermediate mass elements in the outer layers of the ejecta .",
    "such elements are naturally produced in the collisions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : ignition 2d ] .",
    "our models pass two additional quantitative , nontrivial , and robust observational tests , which are independent of the complicated optical radiation transfer .",
    "the main channel by which the radioactive decay chain @xmath41 converts its energy to observed light , is through the energy deposition of @xmath42-ray photons and positrons into the ejecta .",
    "the heated ejecta reprocesses this energy into observed optical light . the late - time",
    "( @xmath43 days since explosion ) bolometric luminosity equals the instantaneous @xmath42-ray energy deposition rate , which is calculated by a monte carlo code for the compton - scattering - dominated transport of @xmath42-rays ( with a small contribution from positrons which are assumed to deposit their kinetic energy locally ) .",
    "the ejecta is taken from the calculations at a sufficiently late time where the expansion is homologous .",
    "we find that the deposited fraction of @xmath42-rays as a function of time is the same in all of our models ( within @xmath4 , where our results converge to better than the numerical statistical noise of @xmath44ni mass . ] ) and in excellent agreement with the sample of @xmath45 low extinction ( galactic+host @xmath46 ) bolometric light curves of @xcite , when appropriately normalized by the ( time - weighted ) integrated luminosity ( see figure  [ fig : late_bolometric ] ) .",
    "given that the ejecta is not spherically symmetric , the emission may depend on viewing angle , possibly widening the scatter of expected late - time luminosities .",
    "while this possible correction is beyond the scope of this letter , the angle - average value should be accurately represented by our results .",
    "to illustrate that this agreement is nontrivial , we calculated the light curves of simple chandrasekhar toy models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with an exponential density distribution as function of velocity ( @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is set by the total release of energy in the explosion ) and varying @xmath1ni masses ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "while the late - time light curve of the @xmath50 @xmath1ni chandrasekhar - model lies at the high end of observed light curves , the @xmath51 @xmath1ni chandrasekhar - model has a much higher normalized light curve and is inconsistent with observations ( see figure  [ fig : late_bolometric ] ) .",
    "the strong emission at late time is due to the efficient deposition of @xmath42-rays in the slowly moving , massive @xmath52 ejecta surrounding the @xmath1ni . to confirm that the main problem with the chandrasekhar toy model is the high ejecta mass",
    ", we apply a `` collision - like '' spherical model .",
    "this model has the same exponential density distribution , but with a smaller ejecta mass ( @xmath53 ) , roughly corresponding to the relevant head - on collision for the @xmath51 @xmath1ni yield ( the kinetic energy is set by the same collision ) .",
    "the `` collision - like '' model has a lower normalized light curve , and shows a much better agreement with the observations ( figure  [ fig : late_bolometric ] ) .",
    "we note that chandrasekhar - models in which the @xmath1ni mass is located far from the center may alleviate this particular problem .",
    "more details will be provided in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "the distribution of widths of the ( @xmath1ni - mass weighted ) line - of - sight ( los ) velocities for the collision models is compared to those inferred from nebular - phase observations of sne ia in figure  [ fig : nebular_vmod_ni56 ] . for each viewing angle ,",
    "the model widths ( @xmath54 ) are obtained by fitting the distribution of @xmath1ni mass per unit los velocity in that angle using a quadratic function , @xmath55 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the observational widths are obtained by fitting the observed late - time ( @xmath56150 days ) spectrasuspect/ ) . ] in the range @xmath57 to the convolution of the low - width spectra templates of 1991bg and 1999by with the same quadratic velocity distribution .",
    "we note that while several properties of 1991bg and 1999by are uncommon , their nebular spectra in the above range are very similar to other sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * except for the line widths ) and should suffice as templates for measuring the line widths of other sne ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "the amount of @xmath1ni is obtained by fitting the bolometric light curves at @xmath58 to the universal injection function presented in figure  [ fig : late_bolometric ] , which is well described by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the time since explosion in days and @xmath61 is the energy injection in @xmath42-rays by @xmath1ni and @xmath1co .",
    "there is a clear correlation between the observed @xmath1ni masses and the nebular - phase velocity widths .",
    "both the correlation and the scatter of this mazzali relation @xcite are well reproduced by the collision model ( 10 viewing angles for each calculation , equally spaced in @xmath62 ; these widths are converged to a level of @xmath63 ) . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : nebular_vmod_ni56 ] ,",
    "the simple chandrasekhar - model predicts a similar correlation , somewhat in offset .",
    "the amount of sne ia with nebular spectra and well described bolometric light curves is limited . in the top panels larger samples ( given in table  2 )",
    "are used to show the continuous correlation of observational features of sne ia with @xmath1ni yields . the strong correlation between @xmath1ni yield and the total mass of the colliding co - wds , figure  [ fig : nimass ] , is suggestive as the source for these correlations , possibly including the philips relation @xcite .",
    "a future robust and detailed test is the time dependent mev scale @xmath42-ray spectrum , which can be computed in a straightforward manner .",
    "other tests , closely related to the nebular velocity widths , include the distribution of non - zero nebular line shifts , which are expected in the collision of non - equal mass co - wds , as well as the unique line shapes resulting from the nontrivial velocity distribution in many collision scenarios .",
    "finally , the early - time spectra and light curves can be compared to observations using suitable radiation transfer models ( see encouraging attempts in * ? ? ?",
    "we stress that our calculations were restricted to the zero - impact - parameter .",
    "only if the effect of the non - zero - impact - parameter is small for a large range of impact parameters , do our calculations represent a significant fraction of collisions ( the distribution of impact parameters is uniform for collisions in triple systems ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , @xmath10 of collisions have impact parameters @xmath64 , where @xmath65 are the radii of the co - wds ) .",
    "@xcite showed that ignition of a detonation can be triggered for several non - zero - impact - parameter collisions in sph simulations .",
    "however , their simulations may suffer from numerical problems which are similar to the ones we identified for their zero - impact - parameter runs in section  [ sec : previous ] , making these results quantitatively uncertain .",
    "non - zero - impact - parameter collisions should be studied using 3d hydrodynamical codes of similar accuracy to the 2d calculation presented here .",
    "high - resolution 3d calculations are also desirable for constraining 3d effects for the zero - impact - parameter collisions .",

    "<S> all collision models yield the same late - time ( @xmath3 days since explosion ) bolometric light curve when normalized by @xmath1ni masses ( to better than @xmath4 ) , in agreement with observations . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated widths of the @xmath1ni - mass - weighted - line - of - sight velocity distributions are correlated with the calculated @xmath1ni yield , agreeing with the observed correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the strong correlation , shown here for the first time , between @xmath1ni yield and total mass of the colliding co - wds ( insensitive to their mass ratio ) , is suggestive as the source for the continuous distribution of observed sn ia features , possibly including the philips relation . </S>"
