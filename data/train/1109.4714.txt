    "in the classical quenched quark models , all established baryons are ascribed into simple 3-quark ( qqq ) configurations  @xcite .",
    "the classical quark models gave very good description of the mass pattern and magnetic moments for the baryon su(3 ) baryon @xmath0 octet and @xmath1 decuplet of spatial ground states .",
    "the excited baryon states are described as excitation of individual constituent quarks , similar to the cases for atomic and nuclear excitations .",
    "the lowest spatial excited baryon is expected to be a ( @xmath2 ) @xmath3 state with one quark in orbital angular momentum @xmath4 state , and hence should have negative parity .",
    "however , experimentally , the lowest negative parity @xmath3 resonance is found to be @xmath5 , which is heavier than two other spatial excited baryons : @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this is the long - standing mass reverse problem for the lowest spatial excited baryons .    in the simple 3q constituent quark models , it is also difficult to understand the strange decay properties of the @xmath5 , which seems to couple strongly to the final states with strangeness . besides a large coupling to @xmath8 , a large value of @xmath9",
    "is deduced  @xcite by a simultaneous fit to bes data on @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and cosy data on @xmath12 .",
    "there is also evidence for large @xmath13 coupling from @xmath14 reaction at clas  @xcite and @xmath15 reaction  @xcite , and large @xmath16 coupling from @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 reactions  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "unlike atomic and nuclear excitations , the typical hadronic excitation energies are comparable with constituent quark masses . hence to drag out a @xmath20 pair from gluon field could be a new excitation mechanism besides the conventional orbital excitation of original constituent quarks .",
    "then the mass reverse problem and the strange decay properties of the @xmath5 can be easily understood by considering 5-quark components in them  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 could be the lowest @xmath4 orbital excited @xmath21 state with a large admixture of @xmath22[us]\\bar s>$ ] pentaquark component having @xmath23 $ ] , @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 in the ground state .",
    "the @xmath7 could be the lowest radial excited @xmath21 state with a large admixture of @xmath22[ud]\\bar d>$ ] pentaquark component having two @xmath23 $ ] diquarks in the relative p - wave . while the lowest @xmath4 orbital excited @xmath21 state should have a mass lower than the lowest radial excited @xmath21 state , the @xmath22[us]\\bar s>$ ] pentaquark component has a higher mass than @xmath22[ud]\\bar d>$ ] pentaquark component .",
    "the lighter @xmath26 is also understandable in this picture .",
    "its main 5-quark configuration is @xmath22[us]\\bar u>$ ] which is lighter than the corresponding 5-quark configuration @xmath22[us]\\bar s>$ ] in the @xmath27 .",
    "the large mixture of the @xmath22[us]\\bar s>$ ] pentaquark component in the @xmath5 naturally results in its large couplings to the @xmath8 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .     for the lowest @xmath31 baryon octet .",
    "]    a breathing mode of @xmath32 is proposed  @xcite for the lowest @xmath31 baryon octet as shown in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "each baryon is a mixture of the three - quark and five - quark components .",
    "the two components represent two different states of the baryon .",
    "the @xmath33 state with @xmath4 and higher kinetic energy has weaker potential ; when quarks expand , a @xmath34 pair is dragged out and results in a @xmath35 state with @xmath36 and stronger potential ; the stronger potential leads @xmath35 state shrinking to a more compact state which then makes the @xmath37 to annihilate with a quark easily and transits to the @xmath33 state with @xmath4 and more kinetic energy to expand ; this leads to constantly transitions between these two states .",
    "the five - quark component has a smaller size than the three - quark component and results in a much flatter @xmath38-dependence for the @xmath39 transition where @xmath40 plays a very important role  @xcite .    besides the penta - quark configurations with the diquark correlation",
    ", the penta - quark system may also be in the form of meson - baryon states .",
    "the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and some other baryon resonances are proposed to be meson - baryon dynamically generated states  @xcite .",
    "quenched @xmath33 quark models and unquenched @xmath41 quark models give very different predictions for the @xmath31 su(3 ) nonet partners of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "while quenched quark models  @xcite predict the @xmath31 @xmath42 and @xmath43 to be around 1650 mev and 1760 mev , respectively , the unquenched quark models  @xcite expect them to be around 1400 mev and 1550 mev , respectively , and meson - baryon dynamical models  @xcite predict them to be around 1450 mev and 1620 mev , respectively .    although various phenomenological models give distinguishable predictions for the lowest @xmath31 @xmath42 and @xmath43 states , none of them are experimentally established .",
    "there is a @xmath31 @xmath44 listed as a 2-star resonance in the pdg tables  @xcite .",
    "however , a recent analysis  @xcite of the new crystal ball data  @xcite on the @xmath45 reaction with the @xmath46 polarization information indicates that the @xmath31 @xmath44 is not needed by the data while the @xmath0 @xmath47 is definitely needed .",
    "the data of differential cross sections for this reaction without @xmath46 polarization information can not distinguish the @xmath31 and @xmath0 .",
    "this may be the reason that some previous analyses claimed the observation of the @xmath31 @xmath44 .",
    "instead some re - analyses  @xcite of the @xmath48 relevant data suggest that there may exist a @xmath49 resonance around 1380 mev , which supports the prediction of unquenched quark models .",
    "to pin down the nature of the lowest @xmath31 su(3 ) baryon nonet , it is crucial to find hyperon states of the lowest su(3 ) @xmath31 nonet and study their properties systematically .",
    "it would be very useful to systematically analyze the available data on @xmath50 , @xmath48 , @xmath51 reactions and relevant @xmath52 decay channels , including the new data from the crystal ball collaboration  @xcite and besiii collaboration .",
    "although many @xmath3 and @xmath53 resonances were proposed to be meson - baryon dynamically generated states or penta - quark states , none of them can be clearly distinguished from qqq - model states due to tunable ingredients and possible large mixing of various configurations in these models . a possible solution to this problem is to extend the penta - quark study to the hidden charm and hidden beauty sectors . if the @xmath5 is the @xmath54 quasi - bound state with hidden strangeness , then naturally by replacing @xmath55 by @xmath56 or @xmath57 one would expect super - heavy @xmath3 states with hidden charm and hidden beauty just below @xmath58 and @xmath59 thresholds , respectively .",
    "following the valencia approach of ref.@xcite and extending it to the hidden charm sector , the interaction between various charmed mesons and charmed baryons were studied with the local hidden gauge formalism in refs.@xcite .",
    "several meson - baryon dynamically generated narrow @xmath3 and @xmath53 resonances with hidden charm are predicted with mass around 4.3 gev and width smaller than 100 mev .",
    "the s - wave @xmath60 and @xmath61 states with isospin i=1/2 and spin s=1/2 were also dynamically investigated within the framework of a chiral constituent quark model by solving a resonating group method ( rgm ) equation by w.l.wang et al .",
    "they confirm that the interaction between @xmath62 and @xmath63 is attractive and results in a @xmath60 bound state not far below threshold .",
    "the predicted new resonances definitely can not be accommodated by quark models with three constituent quarks . because these predicted states have masses above @xmath64 and @xmath65 thresholds , they can be looked for at the forthcoming panda / fair and jlab 12-gev upgrade experiments .",
    "this is an advantage for their experimental searches , compared with those baryons with hidden charms below the @xmath64 threshold proposed by other approaches  @xcite .",
    "the same meson - baryon coupled channel unitary approach with the local hidden gauge formalism was extended to the hidden beauty sector in ref.@xcite .",
    "two @xmath66 states and four @xmath67 states were predicted to be dynamically generated .",
    "because of the hidden @xmath68 components involved in these states , the masses of these states are all above 11 gev while their widths are of only a few mev , which should form part of the heaviest island for the quite stable @xmath3 and @xmath53 baryons . for the valencia approach",
    ", the static limit is assumed for the t - channel exchange of light vector mesons by neglecting momentum dependent terms . in order to investigate the possible influence of the momentum dependent terms ,",
    "the conventional schrodinger equation approach was also used to study possible bound states for the @xmath59 channel by keeping the momentum dependent terms in the t - channel meson exchange potential .",
    "it was found that within the reasonable model parameter range the two approaches give consistent predictions about possible bound states .",
    "this gives some justification of the simple valencia approach although there could be an uncertainty of 10 - 20 mev for the binding energies .",
    "production cross sections of the predicted @xmath69 resonances in @xmath70 and @xmath71 collisions were estimated as a guide for the possible experimental search at relevant facilities in the future . for the @xmath72 reaction , the best center - of - mass energy for observing the predicted @xmath69 is @xmath73 gev , where the production cross section is about 0.01 nb . for the @xmath74 reaction ,",
    "when the center - of - mass energy is larger than 14 gev , the production cross section should be larger than 0.1 nb .",
    "nowadays , the luminosity for pp or ep collisions can reach @xmath75 , this will produce more than 1000 events per day for the @xmath69 production .",
    "it is expected that future facilities , such as proposed electron - ion collider ( eic ) , may discover these very interesting super - heavy @xmath3 and @xmath53 with hidden beauty .",
    "very recently , the observation of the iso - vector meson partners of the predicted @xmath69 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , were reported by belle collaboration  @xcite .",
    "this gives us stronger confidence on the existence of the super - heavy island for the @xmath69 and @xmath78 resonances .",
