    "a rapid increase of the computational cost and instabilities in simulation algorithms have so far limited simulations of qcd with dynamical wilson - type quarks to quark masses corresponding to @xmath7 0.6 @xcite , to be compared with the physical value @xmath8 .",
    "this limitation of the range of quark masses causes sizable ambiguities and systematic errors in the extrapolation to the physical point .",

    "@xcite , the bicgstab algorithm is adopted to invert the quark matrix . at small quark masses , the bicgstab sometimes fails to converge .",
    "while the cg algorithm is guaranteed to converge , it is quite time - consuming .",
    "we find that an extension of bicgstab to @xmath4-th order minimal residual polynomials , the bicgstab(@xmath4 ) algorithm @xcite , is more stable .",
    "the conventional bicgstab corresponds to the case @xmath13 .",
    "a larger @xmath4 is expected to lead to a better convergence . in practice , however , too large @xmath4 is time - consuming and also frequently introduces other instabilities .",
    "figure [ fig : residual ] shows the @xmath4-dependence of the residual on a test configuration .",

    "this is an improvement of bicgstab(@xmath4 ) in which an optimum @xmath4 is dynamically selected .",
    "we find that bicgstab(ds-@xmath4 ) is much more robust than the original bicgstab at small quark masses without much increase of the computer time .",
    "another difficulty at small quark masses is the appearance of instabilities in md evolutions of the hmc algorithm .",
    "figure [ fig : spike_history ] is an example of the time history of @xmath14 at @xmath0 .",
    "we observe that @xmath5 sometimes shows huge values ( `` spikes '' ) .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been reported in @xcite .",
    "a consequence of the spikes is a distorted distribution of @xmath15 at @xmath16 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : spike_history ] ) .",
    "while the trial configurations with large @xmath5 are automatically rejected by the hmc algorithm , the distortion of the @xmath15 distribution can introduce additional systematic errors ( within the statistical errors ) through the accept / reject process .",
    "we find that the frequency of spikes decreases as we decrease the md step size @xmath17 .",
    "we have also checked that spikes do not violate the reversibility and area - preservation required by the hmc algorithm .",

    "[ fig : spike ] , we find that @xmath5 jumps to a large value when the quark force becomes large .",

    "= 6.9 cm    a mechanism to induce large @xmath5 from large force is described in @xcite . in a simple harmonic oscillator system with the frequency @xmath24 ,",
    "a discrete approximation of the md evolution becomes unstable for @xmath25 and @xmath5 diverges exponentially with the md time .",
    "this suggests that the discretized md evolution of hmc with fixed @xmath17 may become unstable if an effective @xmath26 in qcd exceeds a critical value .",

    "we note that the new data points are consistent with the previous data in the overlapping region , but show a deviation from the chiral extrapolation fit curves of the previous data , at small quark masses .",
    "the difference amounts to 3% ( 2.5@xmath28 ) in the chiral limit . comparing the results from @xmath11 and @xmath12 lattices , we find that the finite size effects are small at @xmath9 , while , at @xmath29 , @xmath30 on @xmath12 is slightly lower by 2% ( 1.5@xmath28 ) .",
