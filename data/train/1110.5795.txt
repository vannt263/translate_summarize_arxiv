    "despite the success of the standard three - neutrino oscillations in explaining the results of solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments @xcite by two distinct mass - squared differences , a number of anomalies from the short base - line antineutrino experiments ( e.g. , lsnd @xcite and miniboone @xcite ) and the latest reactor antineutrino fluxes @xcite indicate the existence of oscillations with much shorter baselines .",
    "this would imply the existence of extra mass - squared differences and therefore the mixing of active neutrinos with extra sterile neutrino states @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the analysis @xcite of cosmic microwave background and large scale structure data is hinting an existence of additional radiation in the universe , with sterile neutrinos being one of the plausible candidates . finally , one extra sterile neutrino is also allowed and even favored from a recent analysis of the big bang nucleosynthesis bound @xcite .",
    "therefore , we should be open - minded on their existence and it might be instructive to study the light sterile neutrino hypothesis with other oscillation channels @xcite or in non - oscillation processes including the beta decay @xcite and neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite .    the most promising process to probe the majorana nature of massive neutrinos and acquire the information of majorana cp - violating phases is the neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath3 ) @xcite of some even - even nuclei : @xmath4 which takes place via the exchange of majorana neutrinos but would be prohibited if neutrinos are the dirac particles .",
    "the decay rate is proportional to an effective majorana neutrino mass term @xmath5 and to the associated nuclear matrix element .",
    "the latter can in principle be calculated with some uncertainties @xcite in nuclear physics .",
    "the effective neutrino mass @xmath5 is related to the neutrino masses , mixing angles and majorana cp phases as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass of the @xmath8 neutrino mass state and the sum of @xmath9 includes all light neutrino mass states .",
    "@xmath10 stands for an element in the first row of the lepton flavor mixing matrix , and it contains a majorana cp phase in general .",
    "great efforts have been made to search for signals of the @xmath3 process @xcite recently , however , only negative results have been obtained and the upper bound on the effective neutrino mass is achieved accordingly ( i.e. , @xmath11 @xcite ) .",
    "although a positive @xmath3 signal would verify the majorana nature of massive neutrinos , negative results do not necessarily mean that neutrinos are the dirac particles .",
    "for majorana neutrinos , a vanishing effective neutrino mass @xmath12 due to cancelation among different mass eigenstates could also lead to the failure of @xmath3 observations .",
    "this possibility in the standard scenario of three - neutrino mixing has been explored in some previous works @xcite .",
    "if light ( sub - ev ) sterile neutrinos exist and are mixed with their active counterparts , they will also contribute to the @xmath3 decay rate and modify the prediction on the effective neutrino mass @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the parameter space of a vanishing @xmath12 will get altered drastically in contrast to the standard scenario .",
    "this point constitutes the main concern of the present work .",
    "we shall derive the correlative relations among neutrino masses , mixing angles and majorana cp phases and constrain the corresponding parameters by using current experimental data of active and sterile neutrino oscillations .",
    "the main part of this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we shall describe the theoretical framework and derive the analytical formulas for a vanishing @xmath12 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a numerical analysis .",
    "the analytical relations will be confronted with current global oscillation data and numerical examples will be illustrated in several specific cases .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 4 .",
    "assuming that neutrinos are the majorana particles and there exist @xmath13 species of light sterile neutrinos , the neutrino flavor eigenstates ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) are connected with the @xmath17 mass eigenstates ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) by a @xmath20 flavor mixing matrix @xmath21 in the charged - current interactions , which contains @xmath22 mixing angles , @xmath23 dirac cp phases and @xmath24 majorana cp phases . in the @xmath3 process , as revealed in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , only the mixing matrix elements in the first row of @xmath21 are relevant in our calculations . without loss of generality",
    ", we may redefine the phases of three charged lepton fields in an appropriate way such that the phase of the mixing matrix element @xmath25 is only of the majorana type .",
    "so the expression for the effective neutrino mass @xmath12 can be rewritten as @xmath26 where @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) are the majorana phases and a vanishing @xmath29 has been chosen .",
    "although some schemes with more than one sterile neutrino may have their distinct properties such as cp violating effects in active - sterile neutrino oscillations @xcite , we can combine all the sterile neutrino contributions in the @xmath3 process by assuming an effective ( 3 + 1 ) scheme in which the additional neutrino mass @xmath30 , mixing matrix element @xmath31 and majorana cp phase @xmath32 are defined by @xmath33 taking account of eq .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , we find that a vanishing effective neutrino mass ( i.e.,@xmath34 ) requires @xmath35 comparing these two conditions with current experimental data on the mixing matrix elements ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath31 ) and the mass - squared differences ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , we might be allowed to determine or constrain the absolute neutrino mass scale , neutrino mass hierarchies and majorana cp phases . before doing the most general analysis , however , let us discuss several specific cases to reveal the main consequences of eq .",
    "\\(a ) the case of @xmath42 or @xmath43 ( or both ) means that contributions to @xmath12 are canceled out among different sterile species of the mass eigenstates , which is practically equivalent to the standard scenario of three - neutrino mixing . taking the ( 3 + 2 ) scheme with two additional sterile neutrinos as an example",
    ", the cancelation between @xmath44 and @xmath45 indicates @xmath46 with @xmath47 being an arbitrary non - negative integer . in this case",
    ", a vanishing @xmath12 only requires the parameter correlations among three active neutrinos , @xmath48 which have already been studied in some earlier literatures @xcite .",
    "therefore , we shall only discuss the @xmath3 process with non - vanishing sterile neutrino contributions in the following parts of this work .",
    "\\(b ) the case of cp invariance requires that all the majorana cp phases should take some specific values ( i.e. , @xmath49 with @xmath50 being arbitrary integers ) .",
    "so the two conditions in eq .",
    "( 5 ) will be simplified to a single one , @xmath51 with @xmath52 for ( @xmath53 ) , depending on @xmath54 being even or odd integers respectively .",
    "thus the mass spectrum of active and sterile neutrinos might be fully determined for each group of ( @xmath55,@xmath56,@xmath57 ) with the help of current knowledge on neutrino mass - squared differences and mixing matrix elements .",
    "a simple calculation shows that ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) and ( 1 , 0 , 1 ) are permitted for both mass hierarchies of active neutrinos , ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) and ( 0 , 1 , 1 ) are allowed only for the case of @xmath58 , but all the other possibilities are ruled out by current global neutrino data .",
    "\\(c ) the case of a neutrino mass eigenstate being massless depends on the sign of @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 or @xmath61 might hold for normal or inverted mass hierarchies respectively .",
    "if @xmath62 and @xmath60 hold , then eq . ( 5 ) requires @xmath63 on the other hand , in the case of @xmath64 and @xmath61 , we are led to @xmath65 since the masses of active neutrinos are totally calculable when we assume @xmath60 or @xmath61 , part of the parameter space of majorana cp phases must be excluded .",
    "furthermore , the allowed region of ( @xmath30 , @xmath66 ) might be constrained either by using eq .",
    "( 9 ) or eq . (",
    "10 ) from the active neutrino data or by using eq .",
    "( 4 ) from the sterile neutrino data .",
    "therefore , a comparison between the two sectors may test the conditions of @xmath34 and give complete constraints on the ( @xmath30 , @xmath66 ) parameter space .",
    "in addition to the special cases considered above , we can derive the most general results about @xmath67 and @xmath68 from the conditions in eq .",
    "indeed , @xmath69 as well as @xmath70 note from eq .",
    "( 11 ) and eq .",
    "( 12 ) that the parameters of sterile neutrinos ( i.e. , @xmath71 and @xmath68 ) may be calculated from the active neutrino data , depending on the absolute neutrino mass scale and neutrino mass hierarchies . on the other hand , we may directly constrain @xmath71 and @xmath68 from the sterile neutrino data by using eq . ( 4 ) .",
    "a combined analysis of both sectors will give the complete parameter space allowed by the global neutrino data .",
    "to be explicit , let us carry out a numerical analysis of the implications of @xmath34 . for illustration",
    ", we shall take the ( 3 + 2 ) neutrino mixing scheme with two sub - ev sterile neutrinos as an example , which is more or less favored by the latest experimental @xcite and cosmological data @xcite .",
    "we may also assume that these sterile neutrinos under consideration do not significantly affect the values of two mass - squared differences and three mixing angles of active neutrinos extracted from current active neutrino data @xcite .",
    "in this assumption we shall use the latest results on active neutrino parameters in ref .",
    "@xcite and sterile neutrino data in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 together with @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 as typical inputs of the best - fit values .",
    "the sign of @xmath81 is unknown and the absolute neutrino mass scale , which can be characterized by the smallest neutrino mass ( @xmath82 for @xmath83 or @xmath84 for @xmath85 ) , is expected to be at most of @xmath86 ev or @xmath87 ev as constrained by current experimental and cosmological data @xcite . on the other hand , the majorana cp phases are totally unconstrained and will vary in the full parameter space .",
    "finally , we shall take into account the uncertainties of active neutrino parameters at the @xmath88 or @xmath89 confident level in our numerical analysis but neglect the uncertainties of sterile neutrino parameters which are not explicitly presented in ref .",
    "we admit that our calculations are quite preliminary and mainly serve for illustration , but it should be emphasized that they indeed reveal the main consequences of @xmath90 .",
    "now we are able to do the numerical analysis on possible implications of @xmath34 .",
    "we shall employ the analytical results of different cases discussed in section 2 as our guidelines and plot the corresponding regions allowed by the global oscillation data .    in the cases of the smallest neutrino mass being zero , it is straightforward to present the correlative relations among different majorana cp phases and between ( @xmath30 , @xmath66 ) . first we illustrate the case of @xmath60 in fig .",
    "the parameter space of two majorana phases ( @xmath32 , @xmath91 ) is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , where different ( black and grey ) colors stand for @xmath88 and @xmath89 ranges of the active neutrino parameters respectively . one should note that @xmath92 is irrelevant in this case because the massless mass eigenstate @xmath93 does not contribute to the @xmath3 process . in fig 1(a ) , we can learn that there are two isolated regions to guarantee @xmath90 , and they are related through the transformation of ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) .",
    "this point can be understood by considering the fact that the formulas in eq .",
    "( 9 ) are invariant under the same transformation .",
    "furthermore , the allowed regions can be generalized to the larger ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) parameter space , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are arbitrary integers .",
    "the allowed regions of ( @xmath30 , @xmath66 ) can be found in fig .",
    "1(b ) , where the ( black and grey ) shaded regions stand for constraints from the active neutrino data and the region with ( red ) sparse lines is required by the sterile neutrino parameters .",
    "the ( black ) horizontal line stands for the @xmath100 upper bound on the sum of the neutrino masses from cosmological probes @xcite and only the region below this line is allowed .",
    "the profiles of these allowed regions have the shape of the inverse - rate curve in the single logarithmic scale , which can be easily understood by the analytical expressions in eq .",
    "( 4 ) and eq . ( 5 ) .",
    "one should also note that there is no overlap between the allowed regions of active and sterile neutrino data even within the @xmath89 ranges , indicating that the case of @xmath60 and @xmath83 is disfavored by current global oscillation data if @xmath34 holds .",
    "this conclusion demonstrates the fact that the minimum of @xmath71 from the sterile neutrino data , @xmath101 is always larger than the maximum of @xmath71 from the active neutrino data , @xmath102 .    a similar analysis for @xmath85 and @xmath61 is given in fig .",
    "the allowed regions of majorana cp phases and ( @xmath30 , @xmath66 ) are illustrated in the upper and lower panels respectively .",
    "only the differences of majorana phases can be constrained because it is the third mass eigenstate @xmath103 that decouples from the effective mass @xmath12 due to its masslessness . in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we take ( @xmath104 ) and ( @xmath105 ) as free parameters and find that they are strongly correlated and constrained .",
    "the area of the allowed region here is much smaller than that in fig .",
    "1(a ) simply for the reason that the mixing matrix elements of active neutrinos in eq . ( 10 ) ( i.e. , @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) are much more precise than that appearing only in eq . ( 9 ) ( i.e. , @xmath108 ) .",
    "now let us take a look at fig .",
    "2(b ) for the allowed regions of ( @xmath30 , @xmath66 ) . the ( black ) horizontal line stands for the @xmath100 upper bound on the sum of the neutrino masses from cosmological probes @xcite .",
    "its most distinct difference from fig .",
    "1(b ) is the overlaps between active and sterile neutrino constraints appearing at both @xmath88 and @xmath89 levels .",
    "therefore , @xmath61 and @xmath34 can be simultaneously satisfied in the presence of sub - ev sterile neutrinos . in the meantime , it is instructive to compare the present scenario with the standard scenario of three - neutrino mixing , where a vanishing @xmath5 favors @xmath83 over @xmath85 .",
    "so far we have only discussed the consequences of a vanishing @xmath12 in some specific cases . to illustrate the dependence on the absolute neutrino mass scale",
    ", we calculate the allowed ranges of @xmath71 versus the smallest neutrino mass ( @xmath82 or @xmath84 ) for both neutrino mass hierarchies in fig .",
    "we give the constraints from the active neutrino data with ( black and grey ) shaded regions and constraints from the sterile neutrino data with regions of ( red ) sparse lines .",
    "the overlapping regions of both sectors are the complete parameter space of @xmath34 and the global oscillation data .",
    "the case of @xmath83 is illustrated in fig .",
    "3(a ) , which confirms the previous conclusion that the specific case of @xmath60 is disfavored by current global oscillation data . as @xmath82 is getting larger , the active neutrino spectrum changes from the hierarchical type to the quasi - degenerate one and therefore the relations between @xmath71 and @xmath82 in eq . ( 11 ) approximate to linear functions .",
    "numerically , we may find the allowed ranges explicitly as @xmath109 and @xmath110 . in comparison",
    ", a similar calculation for @xmath85 can be found in fig .",
    "3(b ) and the ranges of @xmath84 and @xmath71 are @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "finally , let us comment on the majorana cp phase @xmath32 in eq .",
    "although it can be calculated from the active neutrino data , there is no correlation between @xmath32 and the absolute mass scale ( characterized by @xmath82 or @xmath84 ) .",
    "our numerical calculation shows that @xmath32 may run over the full parameter space at each point of the smallest neutrino mass ( @xmath82 or @xmath84 ) .",
    "only when the neutrino mass scale is fixed , as the specific cases discussed above , there can be non - trivial correlations among different majorana cp phases . within the full parameter ranges ,",
    "it is instructive to estimate the minimal value of the effective majorana mass ( i.e. , @xmath113 ) where @xmath12 does not vanish .",
    "we calculate @xmath114 versus the smallest neutrino mass ( @xmath82 or @xmath84 ) for both @xmath115 and @xmath85 cases in fig .",
    "the black solid and grey dashed lines stand for @xmath88 and @xmath89 ranges of the active neutrino data respectively .",
    "when @xmath83 holds , there are two separated ranges of @xmath116 for a non - vanishing @xmath114 .",
    "a hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum with @xmath117 predicts a minimal value of @xmath12 as @xmath118 and the magnitude of @xmath114 can reach the @xmath119 level for a nearly degenerate spectrum of the active neutrinos .",
    "in contrast , a non - vanishing @xmath113 can only achieved for @xmath120 in the case of @xmath85 and @xmath114 grows as @xmath121 becomes larger .",
    "motivated by non - observation of the @xmath3 process and possible hints of sub - ev sterile neutrinos from the latest experimental and cosmological data , we have discussed the implications of a vanishing effective majorana mass ( i.e. , @xmath90 ) in the presence of light sterile neutrinos .",
    "current neutrino oscillation data from both active and sterile neutrinos do allow @xmath34 to hold if neutrinos are the majorana particles and their masses , mixing angles and majorana cp phases possess some specific correlations .",
    "the allowed parameter space can be drastically altered in contrast to that of the standard three - neutrino mixing scenario . for the standard scenario ,",
    "a vanishing @xmath12 favors @xmath115 over @xmath85 .",
    "however , it is not really the case after we include the light sterile neutrino contributions . in the specific case",
    "where the smallest neutrino mass vanishes , a vanishing @xmath12 is consistent with the case of @xmath85 rather than @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , for the complete parameter ranges , both cases are allowed and we may constrain the smallest neutrino mass as @xmath109 and @xmath122 respectively .    going beyond the standard model , there are different mechanisms @xcite that may be able to mediate the @xmath3 process , including light ( active and sterile ) majorana neutrinos , heavy sterile majorana neutrinos @xcite and other particles @xcite that can induce the lepton - number - violating ( lnv ) interactions .",
    "we stress that we have simply neglected all the contributions other than light majorana neutrinos and our conclusions will be invalid once other mechanisms can give a comparable decay rate as either light active neutrinos or light sterile neutrinos .",
    "in addition , when more accurate data on neutrino mass and mixing parameters and more sensitive observations or constraints on the @xmath3 process are achieved in the future @xcite , it might be possible to confirm or rule out the parameter space we have obtained and even probe the existence of light sterile neutrino states .",
