    "the massive conformal gravity ( mcg ) @xcite is a recently developed conformally invariant theory of gravity in which the gravitational action is the sum of the weyl action @xcite with the einstein - hilbert action conformally coupled to a scalar field @xcite .",
    "the mcg gravitational potential , which is composed by an attractive newtonian potential and a repulsive yukawa potential , describes well the rotation curves of galaxies without dark matter @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the linear approximation of the theory is quantizable @xcite .",
    "it was recently been shown that the shwarzschild black hole is unstable in mcg @xcite .",
    "this instability , which is a common feature of the schwarzschild black hole found in massive theories of gravity @xcite , may be useful for the resolution of the information paradox for evaporating black holes in general relativity @xcite .    despite the promising results of mcg obtained so far",
    ", it is important to test the theory with cosmological observations . the most accepted cosmological model to explain the current accelerated expansion of the universe is the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this model is consistent with most of current cosmological observations , but suffers from the cosmological constant problem @xcite , as well as the age problem @xcite .",
    "here we want to see if mcg explains the current accelerating universe without these problems .",
    "it is well known that conformally invariant theories of gravity couple consistently with matter fields whose energy - momentum tensors are traceless @xcite .",
    "however , in these theories the matter fields are considered to couple only with the metric tensor . in this article , we consider that the matter fields couple also with the mcg scalar field . in section 2",
    "we derive the field equations of the theory in the presence of matter fields . in section 3",
    "we analyze the coupling of the dirac spinor fields with the gravitational field in mcg . in section 4",
    "we find the mcg cosmological solutions . in section 5",
    "we compare the cosmological solutions of mcg with cosmological observations",

    "it is worth noting that the total action ( [ 1 ] ) is invariant under the conformal transformations @xmath15",
    "@xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an arbitrary function of the spacetime coordinates .",
    "varying the total action ( [ 1 ] ) with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath9 , we obtain the field equations @xmath20 = k t_{\\mu\\nu } , \\label{6}\\ ] ] @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the bach tensor , @xmath23 is the einstein tensor , @xmath24 is the generally covariant dlambertian for a scalar field , @xmath25 is the matter energy - momentum tensor , and @xmath26 is the trace of the matter energy - momentum tensor .    using the conformal invariance of the theory , we can impose the unitary gauge @xmath27 and the field equations ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) becomes @xmath28 @xmath29 in addition , the conformal line element @xmath30 in the unitary gauge reduces to the general relativistic line element @xmath31 the full cosmological content of mcg can be obtained from ( [ 13])-([15 ] ) without loss of generality .",
    "we will address this issue in section 4 .",
    "most of the general coordinate invariant lagrangian densities of massless matter fields are conformal invariant too . in these cases",
    "we do not need to modify such lagrangian densities , which must remain independent of the scalar field @xmath9 .",
    "however , the same is not true for massive matter fields .",
    "let us consider the real valued general coordinate invariant lagrangian density for a dirac spinor field @xmath32 of mass @xmath33 , which is given by @xmath34 , \\label{16}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the adjoint dirac spinor field , @xmath36/8   - [ \\gamma^{\\nu},\\gamma_{\\lambda}]\\gamma^{\\lambda}\\,\\!\\!_{\\mu\\nu}/8 $ ] ( @xmath37 is the levi - civita connection ) and @xmath38 are the general relativistic dirac matrices , which satisfy the anticommutation relation @xmath39 .",
    "with the help of the conformal transformations ( [ 3 ] ) , @xmath40 and @xmath41 its possible to verify that the massless term of the lagrangian density ( [ 16 ] ) is conformally invariant whereas the mass term is not .",
    "however , considering the coupling of the dirac spinor field @xmath32 with both the metric @xmath42 and the scalar field @xmath9 , we can generalize the lagrangian density ( [ 16 ] ) to the conformally invariant lagrangian density @xmath43 , \\label{17}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "variation of the lagrangian density ( [ 17 ] ) with respect to @xmath45 and @xmath32 gives the field equations @xmath46 @xmath47 the second term in ( [ 18 ] ) means that the coupled dirac spinor field @xmath32 get its mass through the scalar field @xmath9 . by substituting the lagrangian density ( [ 17 ] ) into ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) , and using the field equations ( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) , we obtain @xmath48 @xmath49 additional use of the field equations ( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) confirms that the trace of the energy - momentum tensor ( [ 20 ] ) is indeed given by ( [ 21 ] ) , as required by mcg .",
    "an incoherent averaging of ( [ 20 ] ) over all the plane wave states propagating in spacetime will bring the energy - momentum tensor to the usual form of a perfect fluid @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the fluid density , @xmath52 is the fluid pressure and @xmath53 is the fluid four - velocity , which is normalized to @xmath54 . using the constant equation of state @xmath55 , we can write ( [ 22 ] ) as @xmath56\\rho , \\label{23}\\ ] ] which includes radiation ( @xmath57 ) , pressure free matter ( @xmath58 ) and vacuum energy ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "let us consider that the spacetime geometry of the universe is described by the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) line element @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the scale factor and @xmath62 -1 , 0 or 1 is the spatial curvature index .",
    "in order to solve the mcg field equations , it is suitable to introduce the conformal time @xmath63 , defined by the relation @xmath64 such that the frw line element ( [ 24 ] ) becomes @xmath65 it follows from ( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 26 ] ) that the nonzero components of the metric tensor are given by @xmath66    in a comoving frame where @xmath67 the nonzero covariant components of the energy - momentum tensor ( [ 23 ] ) take the form @xmath68 then , using ( [ 27 ] ) and ( [ 29 ] ) , the field equations ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) gives @xmath69 @xmath70 where the dot denotes @xmath71 .    subtracting ( [ 31 ] ) from ( [ 30 ] ) , we obtain @xmath72 we can write this equation as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the hubble constant , and @xmath75 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "it is worth noticing that the only physical solutions ( @xmath76 ) of ( [ 30])-([32 ] ) are for an open universe ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "such solutions read @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are constants .",
    "it follows from ( [ 25 ] ) and ( [ 36 ] ) that @xmath82 the functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 determine the scale factor @xmath61 in parametric form .",
    "we can assume that the universe is radiation dominated at early times , matter dominated today and vacuum dominated at latter times .",
    "thus , according to ( [ 36 ] ) , the mcg universe expands from an initial finite value at @xmath85 where @xmath86 , making the theory singularity - free . at the present time ( @xmath87 )",
    ", the mcg universe continues to expand with @xmath88 . in this case , by substituting @xmath89 into ( [ 34 ] ) and ( [ 35 ] ) , we find @xmath90 @xmath91 which are the observable cosmological parameters that we will use to determine the current age @xmath92 and the current mass density @xmath93 of the mcg universe .",
    "in order to compare the cosmological solutions of mcg with cosmological observations , we must find the luminosity distance @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the redshift of the light emitted from a cosmological light source measured in a laboratory on earth and @xmath96 is the radial distance between that source and the earth .    in an open universe such as the mcg universe ,",
    "the distance @xmath96 is determined by the equation of the radial worldline of a light ray @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the conformal time of the light emission .",
    "it follows from ( [ 41 ] ) that @xmath99 finally , using the relation @xmath100 and some algebra , we obtain @xmath101    in order to estimate the values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 , we use the union2.1 compilation with 580 snia data @xcite .",
    "the procedure consists in compare , for each snia at redshift @xmath104 , the observed distance modulus @xmath105 with the theoretical distance modulus @xmath106 defined as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is measured in mpc .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 are determined by an iterative minimization of the function @xmath109 ^ 2}{\\sigma_{i}^{2 } } , \\label{46}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is the uncertainty on @xmath105 .    the hubble diagram with the 580 snia from the union2.1 compilation and the best - fit mcg model is shown in fig . [ f1 ] .",
    "we find that the best - fit values of the mcg parameters are given by @xmath111 @xmath112 with @xmath113 , where dof is the logogram of degree of freedom .",
    "it follows from ( [ 38 ] ) , ( [ 39 ] ) , ( [ 47 ] ) , ( [ 48 ] ) and @xmath114 that an estimate of the current age of the mcg universe reads @xmath115 which is larger than the @xmath116 gyr estimated from old globular clusters @xcite .",
    "further analysis is needed to see if the mcg universe accommodates the age of the old quasar apm 08279 + 5255 .",
    "the substitution of ( [ 47 ] ) and ( [ 48 ] ) into ( [ 33 ] ) with @xmath117 gives @xmath118 this equation allows us to adjust the @xmath3 value according to the actual matter content of the universe .",
    "considering that the current universe is dominated only by baryonic matter with an estimated mass density @xmath119 g/@xmath120 , we obtain @xmath121 thus there is no need to take others forms of matter than the baryonic matter in mcg .",
    "we have shown in this article that the cosmological solutions of mcg are compatible with the accelerating universe data without needing to appeal to dark matter or dark energy . additionally , the mcg cosmology has no horizon problem or cosmological constant problem .",
    "the compatibility of the current age of the mcg universe with the age of old high redshift objects will be investigated in the future ."
