    "nonlinear discrete systems appear in several branches of science and have found a fruitful field of development and realistic implementation during the last years  @xcite .",
    "many results obtained in very different physical settings can be extrapolated to other areas of research generating a broader and deeper scientific impact .",
    "different techniques and methods to study such systems experimentally , for example in the context of photonic lattices , have been developed with many possibilities to change and control the key parameters . here ,",
    "merely kerr - like ( cubic ) nonlinear systems have been a main subject of theoretical and experimental research . as a result ,",
    "the corroboration of several former theoretical predictions and different new findings have been performed . however , a different type of nonlinearity has opened new challenges with new interesting dynamical properties , the so - called `` saturable nonlinearity '' . on one hand , from a dynamical point of view , this type of nonlinearity allows for a more complex and richer phenomenology than typical cubic systems  @xcite .",
    "for example , in a saturable nonlinear regime an exchange of stability properties between fundamental solutions is allowed , promoting improved mobility for high power solitons .",
    "this is certainly opposite to the phenomenology observed for cubic systems  @xcite , where an increment in power induces localization only . on the other hand ,",
    "only very little experimental realizations showing the specific behavior of saturable systems have been performed .",
    "so far , mainly gradual changes from the behavior of kerr - like systems were observed ; for example , suppression of modulation instability  @xcite , stabilization of discrete vector solitons  @xcite , and higher - order gap solitons  @xcite .",
    "a nonlinear coupler ( dimer ) is the simplest discrete system where there are just two identical nonlinear waveguides ( sites ) - placed in close proximity - which evanescently interact .",
    "thirty years ago , jensen  @xcite showed the main features for the corresponding cubic system ; i.e. , a periodic exchange of light for small power and high transmission ( localization ) for larger powers . in ref .",
    "@xcite authors explored the dynamics and stationary behavior of a cubic coupler which presents only one bifurcation point for stationary solutions and no exchange of stability properties [ similar to larger one - dimensional ( 1d ) cubic systems ] . on the other hand , ref .",
    "@xcite shows the appearance of an extra bifurcation point , change of stability properties and richer dynamics when considering a saturable nonlinearity .",
    "however , only very recently , the concept of `` intermediate solutions '' ( is ) was introduced to explain the properties of extended saturable 1d and 2d lattices  @xcite ( this concept was introduced before for other models  @xcite ) .",
    "these kind of `` unstable '' symmetry - broken solutions appear when two fundamental modes are simultaneously stable ( in other settings , the is can also be stable  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it becomes natural to formulate the question about the minimum number of sites - in a saturable array - for which this phenomenology emerges . in the present work",
    ", we will show that the fundamental saturable properties are already present in a system of just two waveguides .",
    "moreover , for the first time to our knowledge , we show an evidence for the existence of is by observing a multi - stable propagation in an experiment performed in iron doped linbo@xmath0 samples .",
    "the propagation of light in a system composed of two identical weakly coupled waveguides , with a defocusing saturable nonlinearity , can be described as follows @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the light amplitude at site @xmath3 , @xmath4 corresponds to the strength of the defocusing nonlinearity ( @xmath5 ) with respect to the coupling coefficient ( @xmath6 ) between the two sites , and @xmath7 describes the normalized propagation distance along the waveguides .",

    "first of all , we look for linear solutions of model ( [ eq ] ) that , due to the saturation , exist in two different regions  @xcite . in a low power regime",
    ", we find that there are two solutions with frequencies `` @xmath12 '' and `` @xmath13 '' . for higher powers , the nonlinear response vanishes and frequencies become `` @xmath14 '' and `` @xmath15 '' .",
    "the spatial profiles for these two modes are equal in both regimes : the symmetric ( @xmath16 ) and the antisymmetric ( @xmath17 ) modes , respectively .",
    "now , we look for general nonlinear solutions of the form : @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a positive amplitude and @xmath21 describes the ratio between these two site amplitudes .",
    "we found that the symmetric ( @xmath22 ) and the antisymmetric ( @xmath23 ) modes are also solutions in the nonlinear regime .",

    "however , recent works  @xcite have shown that there is a nonzero effective energy barrier , which also considers the is .",
