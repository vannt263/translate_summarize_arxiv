    "our numerical results provide data that can be used to determine the maximum deflection of a ferrofluid in the presence of a magnetic field gradient generated by an external permanent magnet and the consequent transition to jetting .",
    "additionally , a simple scaling law allowed us to collapse our numerical results from a series of configurations onto a single power law .",
    "it is interesting to note that , while the key features observed in the experiments are reproduced in our pure ferrofluid simulations ( i.e. , static interfacial deformations at large magnet separation or low magnetic susceptibility , with transition to jetting at small magnet separations or high magnetic susceptibility ) , the static interfacial profiles obtained in the two systems are rather different . in particular , the interfacial profiles for the water ",

    "this could be due to the water providing a lubricating `` slip '' layer that allows the ferrofluid to be more mobile in the experiments . investigating such mixed systems computationally",
