    "radio pulsars are thought to be highly magnetized ( @xmath5 g ) , rapidly spinning neutron stars whose luminosity is powered by rotational energy loss .",
    "the study of young ( @xmath6 yrs ) rotation - powered pulsars provides an important laboratory for understanding the early evolution ( thermal , spin , and magnetic ) of these embers of stellar collapse .",
    "the most energetic of these pulsars are observable at x - ray wavelengths , which allow us to probe these extreme , but rare , examples .",
    "in addition to uniform spin - down corresponding to the rotational energy loss , rotation powered pulsars show sudden discontinuities in their rotation periods ( see lyne & graham - smith 1998 , chapter 6 ) .",
    "these rare phenomena , known as `` glitches '' are considered to arise from sudden changes in the configuration of super - dense material in the neutron star interior .",
    "to date , a total of 71 glitches with @xmath7 have been reported in 30 pulsars ( urama & okeke 1999 ) .",
    "observation of pulsar glitches gives us insights into the structure and physical processes inside the neutron stars , such as the interactions of neutron superfluid and crust components ( e.g. , anderson & itoh 1975 ) .    in this article we report the detection of a giant glitch from by using the newly acquired multi - mission x - ray data .",
    "this source is an unusual case of a young pulsar discovered first by its x - ray emission , revealed during the course of an archival x - ray study of the snr  ( gotthel , petre , & hwang 1997 ) .",
    "further analysis detected highly significant pulsations from photons attributed to this source ( torii  1998 ) .",
    "the 69 ms pulse period was consistent with that reported from a _ ginga _  observation of the region ( aoki , dotani , & mitsuda 1992 ) .",
    "recent radio observation has confirmed  as a young energetic rotation - powered pulsar ( kaspi  1998 ) .",
    "the lack of evidence for this object in archival soft x - ray images of this field suggested that the source might be highly absorbed , making it difficult to determine whether it is associated with a snr .",
    "a set of day - long x - ray observations of the field containing , , and  were performed with the _ asca _  ( tanaka , inoue , & holt 1994 ) , _ sax _",
    "( boella  1997 ) , and _ xte _  ( bradt  1993 ) observatories .",
    "we summarize in table 1 the set of observations presented in this work .",
    "imaging data were acquired with the gas imaging spectrometers ( gis ) on - board _ asca _  and with the medium energy concentrators ( mecs ) instruments on _ sax_. these instruments have moderate imaging ( @xmath8 ) and spectral resolution ( @xmath9 at 6 kev ) over an energy band pass of @xmath10  kev ( gis ) and @xmath11  kev ( mecs ) , with a field - of - view ( fov ) large enough to cover the snr and pulsar simultaneously .",
    "non - imaging data were obtained with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on - board _ xte _  which provides broader energy band - pass ( @xmath12 kev ) at lower spectral resolution ( @xmath13 at 6 kev ) .",
    "the pca fov is roughly circular with a @xmath14 fwhm response .",
    "the gis data were collected in the highest time resolution mode ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 , depending on data acquisition mode ) whose measured absolute accuracy is @xmath17 in this mode ( saito  1997 ) .",
    "the pca data were collected using the good xenon mode with @xmath18s timing resolution . for the current analysis ,",
    "the absolute timing uncertainty is @xmath19s ( rots  1998 ) .",
    "photons collected by the mecs are time tagged with 15  @xmath20s resolution .",
    "we do not include data from _ asca _ s solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis ) , as the pulsar fell just off the edge of its fov . nor do we include data from _ sax _ s",
    "other instruments as the observing time is insufficient for these instruments to measure the pulsar periodicity reliably , as a part of the observation was interrupted prematurely .",
    "each data set was processed through its standard pipeline reduction for that mission and edited to exclude times of high background contamination using the standard screening criteria .",
    "this rejects time intervals of south atlantic anomaly passages , earth occultations , bright earth limb in the fov ( _ asca _  and _ sax _",
    "only ) , and other periods of high particle activity .",
    "the resulting effective observation times are summarized in table 1 . for each observation ,",
    "event data from all detectors were co - added and the arrival times of each event were corrected to the solar system barycenter using the software timeconv ( _ asca _ ) , baryconv ( _ sax _ ) , or fxbary ( _ xte _ ) .",
    "the x - ray images obtained with both _ asca _  and _ sax _  above 3  kev reveal axs  j161730505505 @xmath21 outside the snr shell ( see figure 1a and 1b of gotthelf  1997 ; gotthelf , petre , & vasisht 1999 ) . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio for detecting pulsations from the pulsar , we extracted photons from an 8@xmath22 diameter aperture centered on the pulsar , restricting the energy range of extracted photons to @xmath23 kev for gis and @xmath24 kev for the other instruments . for the pca data , in this energy band ,",
    "we further restrict our search to layer 1 data only , which provides the best sensitivity for a crab - like spectrum ; for the higher energy analysis afforded by the pca , above @xmath25 kev , we used data from all three pca layers .",
    "we searched each data set for the expected 69 ms period predicted from the initial period and period derivative measurement ( torii 1998 ) .",
    "a periodgram was constructed using the @xmath26 statistic to test against a null hypothesis . for each trial period , we folded the data into 10 bins and computed the @xmath26 of the resultant profile .",
    "we search a narrow range of periods centered on the expected period @xmath27  ms , sampled in increments of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the observation duration , and @xmath1 is the test period .",
    "a highly significant signal was detected from each of our data sets .    as well as the newly obtained data",
    ", we have re - analyzed the previous _ ginga _  and _ asca _  data ( aoki  1992 ; torii  1998 ) in a uniform way and revised the period and its error by using the method of leahy ( 1987 ) .",
    "our x - ray timing results derived from these 13 measurements are listed in table 1 , along with an updated radio ephemeris ( kaspi 1999 , private communication ) .",
    "we search for spectral dependence of the pulse profile by comparing the folded light curves in several energy bands .",
    "no strong energy dependence is evident in the energy resolved light curves .",
    "furthermore , the pulse amplitude and pulse profile remained unchanged between observational epochs .",
    "we examined the _ asca _  and _ sax _",
    "data on  for any long term changes in its energy spectrum or flux . as for the timing analysis",
    ", we restrict our comparison to the energy range above @xmath30 kev and extract photons from an @xmath31 diameter aperture centered on the source .",
    "we fitted the spectrum with a power law function modified by interstellar absorption .",
    "the absorption was fixed at @xmath32 ( torii  1998 ) .",
    "spectra from each observation were found to be consistent with each other . combining the 7 _ asca _  observations",
    ", we obtain the pulse phase averaged photon index , @xmath33 , and the observed flux of @xmath34 ( 90% confidence errors ) in the 3 - 10  kev range , which is consistent with the previous measurement ( torii  1998 ) .",
    "a @xmath35 fit to the all 14 data points as summarized in table 1 gives the mean spin - down rate of @xmath36  s / s and @xmath37 at mjd 50,000.0 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "however , the quality of the fit is bad , with @xmath38 .",
    "the residual of the fit shows a jump of @xmath39  s between the observations of 1993 august ( mjd 49,217.6 ) and 1997 september ( mjd 50,696.0 ) ( figure 2 , top panel ) . within the observation span of 10 years",
    ", the residual is neither periodic nor smooth . a sudden change in the period between mjd 49,217.6 and mjd 50,696.0 is suggested .",
    "we consider the most likely explanation for these residuals is due to a glitch , similar to those observed in several young rotation - powered pulsars",
    ".    given the clear evidence of glitch activity , we next attempted to model the spin - down data with a single glitch followed by an exponential recovery .",
    "the data coverage is limited and we simply assumed the following relation for the spin - down .",
    "@xmath40 where @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 is a negative constant for @xmath44 .",
    "this model contains five parameters , which , except for the depth of the glitch @xmath43 , are found to be independent of the time of the glitch , @xmath45 .",
    "the derived parameters , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath43 , and @xmath48 are summarized in table 2 for assumed values of @xmath49  mjd , @xmath50  mjd , and @xmath51  mjd . the residual for @xmath52",
    "is shown in the middle panel of figure 2 .",
    "the quality of the fit is now characterized by @xmath53 .",
    "the size of the glitch depends strongly upon the unknown glitch epoch @xmath45 .",
    "the fractional increase in rotation was found to be @xmath54 for @xmath55  mjd ( fixed ) while it changes between @xmath56 for @xmath57  mjd ( fixed ) and @xmath58 for @xmath59  mjd ( fixed ) .",
    "the minimum fractional increase in rotation rate is therefore comparable with those of the largest known pulsar glitches ( lyne , 1996a ; shemar & lyne 1996 ) .    using the above model , the recovery time following the glitch episode",
    "is found to be @xmath60  days .",
    "this duration is somewhat unusual compared to the radio pulsars whose recovery time is seen to bifurcate between @xmath61  days and @xmath62  days ( shemar & lyne 1996 ) .",
    "our derived value lies squarely between these two time scales , perhaps due to the simple model we invoked which allows for only a single glitch . because of the sparse data coverage between august 1993 and september 1997 , however , we can not determine if the recovery time could be expressed as the sum of the two timescales .",
    "glitches found in radio pulsars may be classified into three groups ( lyne & graham - smith 1998 ) .",
    "the first is a crab - like glitch which is characterized by steps mainly in @xmath2 .",
    "the second is a vela - like glitch which is characterized by large changes in @xmath1 ( @xmath63 ) and the exponential recoveries . for the vela pulsar , linear sawtooth changes in @xmath2 have been observed between glitches ( lyne  1996b ) .",
    "the third kind is often found in old pulsars which is characterized by a change in @xmath1 .    since the large glitch found for",
    "is similar in its magnitude to those in the vela pulsar , a phenomenological model taking into account the sawtooth behavior may be a good description . apart from short term effects , the spin - down for the vela pulsar is expressed by a linear change in spin - down rate .",
    "therefore , the following function is appropriate if the transient effects have already ceased by mjd 50,696 .",
    "@xmath64 here , @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 and they are constant values ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) for @xmath70 .",
    "this model contains six parameters .",
    "again , the time of the glitch , @xmath45 , had to be assumed .",
    "the derived parameters are summarized in table 3 . for the condition that @xmath71 , @xmath45 was restricted to @xmath72 . the residual for @xmath52",
    "is shown in the bottom panel of figure 2 .",
    "the quality of the fit is significantly improved to @xmath73 .",
    "compared to the fit to equation ( 1 ) , the f - test gives a chance probability of @xmath74 .",
    "this result suggests that transient effects had indeed ceased by mjd  50,696 .",
    "the reduced @xmath75 is still larger than unity , suggesting the presence of timing noise and smaller glitches .",
    "we can estimate the expectancy of large ( @xmath76 ) glitches by using the semi - empirical relation based upon the superfluid vortex unpinning model ( alpar & baykal 1994 ) . using this relation , the expected number of large glitches between the first _ ginga _",
    "observation and the last _ asca _",
    "observations is 3.7 .",
    "therefore , there should have been about 4 glitches of @xmath77 . indeed the residuals to the fit of equation ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) still hint a small jump of @xmath78  s between mjd  51,263.8 ( 1999 mar . ) and mjd  51,394.2 ( 1999 aug ) .",
    "this may be another glitch of @xmath79 , much smaller in magnitude than the one near mjd  50,000 , but still relatively large compared to those seen for most radio pulsars ( shemar & lyne 1996 ) .",
    "we have thus found a giant glitch of @xmath80 at @xmath81  mjd ( @xmath82 ) and possibly a glitch of @xmath83 at @xmath84  mjd ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the detection of a giant glitch from  gives a rare sample for studying the origin of pulsar glitches and the interior structure of neutron stars . in this context ,",
    "regular timing observation of this pulsar in the radio band is quite important to monitor the onset of a glitch and following transient effects .",
    "long term timing observations for measuring the braking index are desired .",
    "searches for the highly absorbed x - ray emission from the supernova remnant associated with this pulsar should be undertaken with the next generation x - ray observatories .",
    "we thank jules halpern for a critical reading of the manuscript , the referee andrew lyne for invaluable comments and suggestions on the original draft , and victoria kaspi for communicating the revised radio ephemeris .",
    "special thanks to alan smale for expediting the delivery of the _ xte _  data and to the xtehelp@athena.gsfc.nasa.gov crew for their patience and assistance .",
