    "given the ambiguity in predictions of qcp in models , studies on lattice was expected to provide reliable estimates .",
    "however lattice calculations at finite @xmath16 have important issues to be addressed . typically , for any lattice computation one needs to evaluate the expectation value of an observable @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the dirac matrix in @xmath62 , colour , spin , flavour space for sea quarks of mass @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the gluonic action , and the observable @xmath59 may contain fermion propagators of mass @xmath65 .",

    "motivated by the fact that non - gaussian features in above observables increase if the system freezes - out closer to qcp , it has been suggested to measure higher moments ( non - zero skewness and kurtosis indicates non - gaussianity ) of net - charge or net - baryon number distributions .",
