    "the nature of the mechanism behind the current cosmic acceleration constitutes a major problem nowadays in cosmology @xcite . even though almost all observational data available so far are in good agreement with the simplest possibility , i.e. , a vacuum energy plus cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) scenario , it is becoming rather consensual that in order to better understand the nature of the dark components of matter and energy , one must also consider more complex models as , for instance , scenarios with interaction in the dark sector @xcite .    in this regard ,",
    "the simplest examples of interacting dark matter / dark energy models are scenarios with vacuum decay [ @xmath0(t)cdm ] . in reality ,",
    "@xmath0(t)cdm cosmologies constitute the special case in which the ratio of the dark energy pressure to its energy density , @xmath2 , is exactly @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this kind of model may be based on the idea that dark energy is the manifestation of vacuum quantum fluctuations in the curved space - time , after a renormalization in which the divergent vacuum contribution in the flat space - time is subtracted .",
    "the resulting effective vacuum energy density will depend on the space - time curvature , decaying from high initial values to smaller ones as the universe expands @xcite . as a result of conservation of total energy , implied by bianchi identities , the variation of vacuum density leads either to particle production or to an increasing in the mass of dark matter particles , two general features of decaying vacuum or , more generally , of interacting dark energy models @xcite .    naturally , the precise law of vacuum density variation depends on a suitable derivation of the vacuum contribution in the curved background , which is in general a difficult task . in this regard , however , a viable possibility is initially to consider a de sitter space - time and estimate the renormalized vacuum contribution with help of thermodynamic reasonings as , e.g. , those in line with the holographic conjecture @xcite .",
    "the resulting ansatz is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the hubble parameter and @xmath6 is a cutoff imposed to regularize the vacuum contribution in flat space - time ( the next step is to consider a quasi - de sitter background , with a slowly decreasing @xmath5 . in this case , the above ansatz may be considered a good approximation , but with the vacuum density decaying with time . ) . in the early - time limit , with @xmath7",
    ", we have @xmath8 . by using this scaling law for the vacuum density and introducing a relativistic matter component ,",
    "some of us have obtained from the einstein equations an interesting solution with the following features @xcite .",
    "firstly , the universe undergoes an empty , quasi - de sitter phase , with @xmath9 , which in the asymptotic limit of infinite past tends to de sitter solution with @xmath10 ( in planck units ) .",
    "however , at a given time , the vacuum undertakes a fast phase transition , with @xmath0 decreasing to nearly zero in a few planck times , producing a considerable amount of radiation . in this sense , this can be understood as a non - singular inflationary scenario , with a semi - eternal quasi - de sitter phase originating a radiation dominated universe .",
    "the subsequent evolution of vacuum energy essentially depends on the masses of the produced particles .",
    "if we apply the energy - time uncertainty relation to the process of matter production , we will conclude that massive particles can be produced only at very early times , when @xmath5 is very high .",
    "therefore , baryonic particles and massive dark matter ( as supersymmetric particles and axions ) stopped being produced before the time of electroweak phase transition .",
    "on the other hand , the late - time production of photons and massless neutrinos must be forbidden by some selection rule , otherwise the universe would be completely different from the one observed today .",
    "thus , if no other particle is produced , the vacuum density stops decaying at very early times , and for late times we have a standard universe , with the presence of a genuine cosmological constant ( some thermodynamic considerations , in line with the holographic principle , permit to infer the value of this constant , leading to @xmath11 @xcite ) .    in order to have a decaying vacuum density at the present time , the produced dark particles should have a mass as small as @xmath12 g and @xmath0 of the orders currently observed @xcite . ] . here , we have considered the possibility of a late - time decaying @xmath0 , and compared the consequent cosmological scenario with the constraints imposed by current observations @xcite .",
    "in such a limit , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , leading again to @xmath15 in the de sitter limit . from a qualitative point of view",
    ", we have found no important difference between this @xmath16 scenario and the flat @xmath0cdm model @xcite .",
    "after the phase transition described above the universe enters a radiation - dominated phase , followed by a matter - dominated era long enough for structure formation , which tends asymptotically to a de sitter universe with vacuum dominating again .",
    "the only important novelty , related to matter production , is a late - time suppression of the density contrast of matter , which may constitute a potential solution to the cosmic coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "moreover , the analysis of the redshift - distance relation for supernovae of type ia , particularly with the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) data set , has shown a good fit , with present values of @xmath5 and the relative density of matter in accordance with other observations @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we go a little further in our investigation and study new observational consequences of the @xmath0(t)cdm scenario described above .",
    "we use to this end distance measurements from type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and the position of the first peak of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "we show that , besides the interesting cosmic history of this class of @xmath0(t)cdm models , a conventional , spatially flat @xmath0cdm model is only slightly favored over them by the current observational data .",
    "in a spatially flat flrw space - time the friedmann and the conservation equations can be written , respectively , as . ]",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the total energy density and pressure , respectively .",
    "if we consider that the cosmic fluid is composed of matter with energy density @xmath21 and pressure @xmath22 , and of a time - dependent vacuum term with energy density @xmath23 and pressure @xmath24 , we obtain @xmath25 which shows that matter is not independently conserved , with the decaying vacuum playing the role of a matter source . throughout our analysis",
    "we assume that baryons are independently conserved at late times , being not produced at the expenses of the decaying vacuum .",
    "this amounts to saying that we will postulate , in addition to eq .",
    "( [ continuidade ] ) , a conservation equation for baryons , i.e. , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 refer to baryon density and pressure .    from the above equations and",
    "considering our late - time ansatz @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is a positive constant of the order of @xmath31 ) , the evolution equation reads @xmath32    now , with the conditions @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the integration of the above equation leads to the following expression for the scale factor , @xmath35^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the first integration constant and the second one was chosen so that @xmath37 at @xmath38 . from these equations , it is straightforward to show that at early times the above expression reduces to the einstein - de sitter solution whereas at late times it tends to the de sitter universe .    as stated earlier , @xmath29 and , therefore , @xmath39 . by using solution ( [ a ] )",
    ", one can also show that @xmath40 and @xmath41    the above expressions can be easily understood as follows .",
    "the first terms in the r.h.s . are the expected scaling laws for matter density and the cosmological constant in the case of a non - decaying vacuum while the second ones are related to the time variation of the vacuum density and the concomitant matter production .",
    "as expected , at early times matter dominates , with its density scaling with @xmath42 , and the matter production process is negligible . on the other hand , at late times the vacuum term dominates , as should be in a de sitter universe .    from eqs .",
    "( [ friedmann ] ) , ( [ rhodust ] ) and ( [ lambdadust ] ) , the evolution of the hubble parameter as a function of the redshift can be written as @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are , respectively , the present values of the hubble parameter and of the relative energy density of matter . note that , due to the matter production , this expression is rather different from that found in the context of the standard @xmath0cdm case .",
    "in particular , if @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we obtain @xmath48 , leading to @xmath49 , as expected for the einstein - de sitter scenario .",
    "extending and updating previous results @xcite , we study in this section some observational consequences of the class of @xmath0(t)cdm scenarios discussed above .",
    "note that , similarly to the standard @xmath0cdm case , this class of models has only two independent parameters , @xmath44 and @xmath45 [ see eq .",
    "( [ hz ] ) ] .",
    "the best - fit values for these quantities will be determined on the basis of a statistical analysis of recent type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) measurements , as given by the snls collaboration @xcite , the distance to the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , and the position of the first peak in the spectrum of anisotropies of cmb radiation from the three - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite ( for more details on the statistical analysis discussed below we refer the reader to ref .",

    "is usually made by means of the parameter @xmath76 , i.e. , @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the typical redshift of the sample and @xmath79 is the dilation scale , defined as @xmath80^{1/3}\\;,\\ ] ] with the comoving distance @xmath81 given by @xmath82    an important aspect worth emphasizing at this point is that the value of @xmath76 is obtained from the data in the context of a @xmath0cdm model , and can be considered a good approximation only for some class of dark energy models @xcite . in particular ,",
    "two conditions are implicitly assumed to be valid @xcite .",
    "first , the evolution of matter density perturbations during the matter - dominated era must be similar to the @xmath0cdm case , at least until the characteristic redshift @xmath78 .",
    "second , the comoving distance to the horizon at the time of equilibrium between matter and radiation must scale with @xmath83 .",
    "however , none of the above conditions are satisfied in the present model because of the matter production associated to the vacuum decay . as will be shown in a forthcoming publication @xcite , if matter is homogeneously produced there is a suppression in its density contrast for @xmath84 , that is , after the period of galaxy formation ( this will eventually imply a higher value of @xmath45 in order to fit the observed mass power spectrum ) .",
    "on the other hand , as radiation is independently conserved , its relative energy density for @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is its present value . with the help of ( [ hz ] ) we can see that , in the same limit @xmath85 , the relative density of matter is @xmath88 ( with the extra factor @xmath45 being due to the matter production between @xmath89 and the present time ) . by equating the two densities",
    ", we obtain the redshift of equilibrium between matter and radiation , given by @xmath90 . therefore , after including conserved radiation into ( [ hz ] ) ( see equation ( [ hgeral ] ) below ) and taking @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the present value of the radiation density ( while in the @xmath0cdm case we would obtain @xmath94 , as stated above ) .",
    "thus , one can see that the parameter @xmath76 is not appropriate to test the model , and we will use instead the dilation scale @xmath79 , which is weakly sensitive to the cosmological evolution before @xmath95 . by combining our function @xmath96 , given by ( [ hz ] ) , into ( [ dv])-([dm ] ) we can find the region in the @xmath97 plane which gives the observed value @xmath98 mpc ( @xmath99 ) @xcite .",
    "the bao bands in the @xmath97 parametric space are shown in fig . 1",
    ".      0.1 in    the two tests we have previously described depend on the physics at low and intermediate redshifts ( until @xmath100 ) and will lead , as we will see , to very similar results . as a complementary test ,",
    "involving high-@xmath50 measurements , let us consider the position of the first peak in the spectrum of cmb anisotropies .",
    "since in the present model there is no production of baryonic matter or radiation and the spatial curvature is null , we expect that a correct position of the first peak is enough to guarantee a spectral profile similar to the @xmath0cdm one , provided the spectrum of primordial fluctuations is the same .    in the context of a large class of dark energy models",
    "this test is performed by comparing the predicted shift parameter with the @xmath0cdm value . however , this is only valid if the acoustic horizon at the time of last scattering is the same @xcite .",
    "this is not true in the present model because , as we have already shown , for the same values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 we have different expressions for cosmological parameters at high redshifts , due to the process of matter production .",
    "therefore , in order to perform a correct test , we have to explicitly calculate the acoustic scale in the model and then compare with the measured position of the peak .    the acoustic scale , defined as the ratio between the comoving distance to the surface of last scattering and the radius of the acoustic horizon at that time ,",
    "is then given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the redshift of last scattering , and @xmath103 is the sound velocity . here",
    ", @xmath104 and @xmath105 are , respectively , the present relative energy densities of baryons and photons .",
    "the function @xmath96 to be used in eq .",
    "( [ la ] ) must now include radiation . as this component is independently conserved , scaling with @xmath106 , the appropriate generalization of eq .",
    "( [ hz ] ) is given by and @xmath107 .",
    "thus , rigorously speaking the generalization of @xmath96 would require a reanalysis of the dynamics . nevertheless , as @xmath108 , when the decaying vacuum and matter production begin to be important , the radiation term is negligible .",
    "for this reason , eq .",
    "( [ hgeral ] ) can be considered a good approximation .",
    "indeed , a numerical analysis in the range @xmath109 showed a difference between eq .",
    "( [ hgeral ] ) and the exact @xmath96 as small as @xmath110 . ]",
    "@xmath111 ^ 2 + \\omega_r ( 1+z)^4 \\right\\}^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    therefore , apart from our two free parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 , in order to determine the acoustic scale we need the present values of the energy densities of radiation , photons and baryons , as well as an expression for @xmath102 .",
    "since radiation and baryons are independently conserved , and we want to preserve the spectrum profile as well as the nucleosynthesis constraints , we will take for these densities the same values obtained from cmb observations in the context of the @xmath0cdm model @xcite : @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "concerning @xmath102 , its value is not in principle the same as in the @xmath0cdm case . to determine its value for a given pair ( @xmath45,@xmath44 ) we will proceed as follows .",
    "first , we obtain the redshift of last scattering @xmath115 in the @xmath0cdm model by means of the current fitting formula @xcite , and then we impose that the optical depth has to be the same in both models , that is , @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the rate of photon scattering and @xmath118 is the hubble parameter in the @xmath0cdm context . for the current intervals of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the relative differences between @xmath102 and @xmath115 are typically as small as @xmath119 .    for a scale invariant @xmath0cdm model with spectral index @xmath120 , the position of the first peak after including the effect of plasma driving",
    "is given by the fitting expression @xcite @xmath121 where @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "since the plasma driving depends essentially on pre - recombination physics , we will therefore assume that the above fitting formulae are a good approximation to the present @xmath16 model .",
    "in our case , the parameter @xmath124 is given by @xmath125    finally , from the above results we can determine the region of the @xmath45-@xmath44 plane for which the first peak has the position currently observed by wmap , i.e. , @xmath126 ( @xmath99 ) @xcite . as in the case of bao , the cmb bands in the @xmath97 parametric space is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the superposition of the confidence regions and bands corresponding to our analysis of sne ia , bao and cmb observations is shown in figure 1 .",
    "for the sake of comparison , the right panel shows the same analysis for the standard @xmath0cdm model . from these analysis",
    ", we note that , although not very restrictive and parallel to the sne ia contours , the bao bands can be statistically combined with sne ia data providing constraints on the @xmath127 plane . at @xmath128 level , we find @xmath129 and @xmath130 , with reduced @xmath131 .",
    "the inclusion of cmb data into our analysis in turn makes the complete joint analysis more restrictive but also shows that the concordance is as good as in the standard @xmath0cdm case , and that the @xmath0(t)cdm model discussed here can not be ruled out .",
    "it can be anticipated from figure 1 that the data will prefer higher values of the matter density parameter , while the hubble parameter is expected to be slightly smaller than the current accepted values . in order to confirm this qualitative discussion ,",
    "figure 2 shows the results of our joint statistical analysis ( sne ia + bao + cmb ) . at @xmath128 level",
    ", we find @xmath132 and @xmath133 , with reduced @xmath70 . for the sake of comparison , the same analysis for the @xmath0cdm case is also shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "2 .    finally , with the above best - fit values for the parameters",
    ", we can calculate the total expanding age for this class of @xmath0(t)cdm models , given by @xcite @xmath134 as well as the redshift of transition from a decelerated expansion to the current accelerating phase , i.e. , @xmath135 .",
    "note that both values are slightly higher than , but of the same order of , the standard ones .",
    "by using the most recent cosmological observations , we have discussed the observational viability of a class of @xmath0(t)cdm scenarios in which @xmath136 , as well as a possible way to distinguish it from the standard @xmath0cdm model in what concerns the general characteristics of the predicted cosmic evolution .",
    "as discussed earlier , these @xmath0(t)cdm models have some interesting features as , e.g. , the association of dark energy with vacuum fluctuations , the circumvention of the cosmological constant problem by subtracting the flat space - time contribution from the curved space - time vacuum density , and the possible ( but not necessary ) link between dark matter and massive gravitons .",
    "we have presented some quantitative results which clearly show that , even in the current stage of the universe evolution , our decaying vacuum scenario is very similar to the standard one .",
    "we have statistically tested the viability of the model by using recent sne ia observations and measurements of the bao and the first peak of the cmb spectrum . at 95.4% c.l .",
    ", a joint analysis involving sne ia + bao provides the intervals @xmath137 and @xmath138 , which are in good agreement with the values of the hubble and the matter density parameters obtained from independent analysis @xcite .",
    "when the position of the first peak of cmb anisotropies is included in the analysis , the best - fit value for the relative matter density is increased , @xmath139 .",
    "this result can not rule out the model , and it may be indicating that , besides the interesting cosmic history of this class of @xmath0(t)cdm models , a conventional , spatially flat @xmath0cdm model is only slightly favored over them by the current observational data .",
    "still on the best - fit for @xmath45 , we note that such a higher matter density is something to be more investigated by means of other cosmological or dynamical tests as , e.g. , the predicted mass power spectrum in the context of the model .",
    "as we have discussed earlier , a higher matter density is necessary to compensate the late - time suppression of the density contrast owing to matter production @xcite .",
    "another possibility will be provided by future supernovae observations , since the present model starts to diverge from the standard one for higher redshifts @xcite .    finally , we should also emphasize two aspects to be considered before a definite conclusion about the comparison between the present model and the flat standard scenario .",
    "first , that in our study of cmb we have used parameter values and fitting formulae that are strictly correct for the @xmath0cdm case , particularly the expression giving the position of the first peak for a given acoustic scale [ equation ( [ l1 ] ) ] . in spite of our reasons to consider that use as a good approximation , it can lead to bias in our results .",
    "if that is the case , only a more complete analysis of cmb would rule out or corroborate the model .",
    "the second aspect is of theoretical character . as discussed in the introduction , our ansatz for the variation of @xmath0 , if genuine , is a good approximation only for quasi - de sitter backgrounds .",
    "naturally , our universe , although dominated by a cosmological term , is far away from the asymptotic de sitter state , with matter still giving an important contribution to the cosmic fluid . only a more profound theoretical study , on the basis of quantum field theories in the expanding background , could establish the degree of applicability and limits of that approximation .",

    "<S> the cosmological constant @xmath0 , i.e. , the energy density stored in the true vacuum state of all existing fields in the universe , is the simplest and the most natural possibility to describe the current cosmic acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> however , despite its observational successes , such a possibility exacerbates the well known @xmath0 problem , requiring a natural explanation for its small , but nonzero , value . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study cosmological consequences of a scenario driven by a varying cosmological term , in which the vacuum energy density decays linearly with the hubble parameter , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we test the viability of this scenario and study a possible way to distinguish it from the current standard cosmological model by using recent observations of type ia supernova ( supernova legacy survey collaboration ) , measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillation from the sloan digital sky survey and the position of the first peak of the cosmic microwave background angular spectrum from the three - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe . </S>"
