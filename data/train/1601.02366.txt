    "in order to resolve the information loss problem @xcite , various ideas have been suggested in the literature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flowchart ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is also fair to say that various ideas have their own problems .",
    "if the black hole evolution is not unitary , then in itself it can cause a serious problem @xcite . if hawking radiation contains information @xcite",
    ", then we finally reach the inconsistency @xcite@xcite .",
    "if information should be retained by another objects , the problem is that we still do not have a generic argument to realize this @xcite .",
    "then what does this mean ? if information should be conserved , but it is not attached by hawking radiation nor by a remnant , then where is the information ?",
    "one interesting way to explain this dilemma is to think that the wave function of the universe contains information ; however , semi - classical observers , like us , can not access the information since we should see a specific semi - classical geometry @xcite ( ` question mark ' in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowchart ] ) .",
    "we name this idea as the _ effective loss of information_.    flowchart on resolutions of the information loss problem . ]    then , how can we realize this idea ? in order to do this , we need to understand the wave function of the universe @xcite , while this is a genuinely quantum gravitational problem . even though there is no consensus on quantum theory of gravity , the euclidean path integral approach @xcite can be a highway to understand , at least , the skeleton of the wave function of the universe , by using instantons .",
    "according to the euclidean path integral approach , the ground state wave function @xcite that satisfies the wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite is presented by the following form : @xmath0},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the initial state , @xmath2 is the final state as a superposition of classical states @xmath3 with probability weights @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the euclidean action , and we sum over all geometries and field combinations that connect from @xmath1 to a certain classical state @xmath6 .    since this path integral is not very easy to do , we approximate this by summing over only on - shell solutions , or instantons , relying on the steepest - descent approximation",
    ". then we can simplify @xmath7    if there exists a history with non - zero probability that connects from @xmath1 to @xmath8 and if this history has no event horizon nor singularity , i.e. , if this has a _ trivial geometry _",
    ", then information will be conserved through the geometry @xcite@xcite .",
    "hence , in this sense , the wave function of the universe has information .",
    "however , since its probability can be highly suppressed due to the entropy cost of the instanton , perhaps the most probable history is the non - trivial geometry that is estimated by the perturbative quantum field theory in a curved spacetime ; and in this sense , the semi - classical observer will lose information @xcite .",
    "now the task is to find such an instanton that mediates a trivial geometry .",
    "still we do not have a generic solution , but we can find various interesting examples using the thin - shell approximation .",
    "we consider a spacetime with the metric , @xmath9 , where a thin - shell locates at @xmath10 : outside the shell is @xmath11 ( denoted by @xmath12 ) and inside the shell is @xmath13 ( denoted by @xmath14 ) .",
    "the thin - shell satisfies the metric @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that the outside and inside the shell look like @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the mass parameters of each region and @xmath19 denotes the amount of the vacuum energy ( @xmath20 can be chosen negative in order to present negative vacuum energy ) .",
    "the equation of motion of the thin - shell is determined by the junction equation @xcite : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the direction of the outward normal direction and @xmath23 is a tension parameter which is a constant for a scalar field case , while in general this can be a function of @xmath10 and should satisfy physical constraints .      for asymptotic anti - de sitter or minkowski cases , many models have been observed .",
    "for example ,    * _ sasaki and yeom _",
    "@xcite considered true vacuum bubbles in anti - de sitter background . * _ lee , lee and yeom _",
    "@xcite considered a magnetic shell in 3-dimensional anti - de sitter background . due to the magnetic field",
    ", there appeared much diverge tunneling channels . * _ chen , domnech , sasaki and yeom _",
    "@xcite considered vacuum bubbles with various tensions that can be in principle justified by physical matters .",
    "some of these examples can show an initial condition that is free from the white hole initial singularity . * _ chen , hu and yeom _",
    "@xcite considered instanton creation from a no - shell combination to a two - shell combination",
    ". the probability can be well - defined , not only relying on the euclidean method @xcite , but also from the hamiltonian method @xcite .",
    "these kind of examples should be generalized in the sense that _",
    "( i ) it should not rely on vacuum structures _ and _ ( ii ) it should not rely on the thin - shell approximation_. we remain these topics as future research directions .",
    "summary of the shell dynamics for symmetric solutions . ]      for asymptotic de sitter cases , there appears further subtle issues . in this section",
    ", we see more details .",
    "if the tension is a constant , then after simple calculations , we can reduce the junction equation by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    left : usual gravitational collapse and evaporation due to hawking radiation .",
    "right : tunneling from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "black dashed curve is for the false vacuum bubble , while blue dashed curve is for the true vacuum bubble . ]",
    "tunneling from @xmath27 to @xmath29 ( aj ) and @xmath30 ( fgg ) .",
    "the blue dashed arrow is a typical world - line of an observer . ]    by analyzing the equation of motion , we can classify the shell dynamics as well as possible tunneling channels @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : signs_ds ] ) . in terms of tunneling processes toward a trivial geometry , we illustrate two important processes .    * _ disappearance of a black hole .",
    "_ a collapsing shell can tunnel to a bouncing shell with out - going energy @xcite .",
    "this was investigated by gregory - moss - withers @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dstunnel2 ] ) . *",
    "_ sweep of a bubble .",
    "_ for some parameter spaces , a tunneling process such as @xmath29 or @xmath30 is possible ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dstunnel ] ) .",
    "the latter was investigated by farhi - guth - guven ( fgg ) @xcite and fischler - morgan - polchinksi @xcite , while the former was investigated by aguirre - johnson ( aj ) @xcite .",
    "the aguirre - johnson tunneling can change to a trivial geometry at least for a local observer ( blue dashed arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : dstunnel ] ) .",
    "however , in this case , a more correct expression is that the shell sweeps the observer and hence the observer suddenly locates inside the bubble .",
    "hence , _ the singularity should be located outside the causal patch of the observer_. only if we restrict the path integral inside the observer - dependent causal patch , we can say that this tunneling induces a trivial geomtery .",
    "non - perturbative effects will shed some lights on the information loss problem and instantons will help to understand this .",
    "we have found various thin - shell instantons , but we need to generalize further : we need to find instantons that result trivial geometries ( i ) without relying on vacuum structures and ( ii ) without relying on the thin - shell approximation .    for de sitter cases , there is an interesting process , so - called the aguirre - johnson tunneling .",
    "this contributes the cosmological horizon scale .",
    "can this mean that a unitary observer should see a superposition of states or uncertainty around the cosmological horizon ?",
    "in any case , unitarity of the de sitter space is less clear in the literature .",
    "this may cause subtle issues and we need further investigations .",
    "one can simplify the junction equation : @xmath31 where we define parameters by @xmath32 now the equation of motion is effectively independent of @xmath23 .    in order to obtain symmetric solutions , we need to require the condition : for a @xmath33 with @xmath34 , there is @xmath35 such that @xmath36 .",
    "hence , @xmath33 should satisfy @xmath37 and we obtain @xmath38 to choose @xmath39 . from this , the existence of symmetric solutions is guaranteed if @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mstar ] ) , where @xmath41^{-3/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath42 as a function of @xmath43 . ]",
    "after we classify the classical trajectories , we determine signs of @xmath44 parameters by comparing extrinsic curvatures : @xmath45 signs of them are determined by @xmath46 , where @xmath47    by using this , we can understand the asymptotic behaviors of extrinsic curvatures and we can eventually classify possible shell trajectories .    * _ asymptotic behaviors : _ * * for collapsing shells , as @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and hence bends toward left . * * for expanding shells , as @xmath50 , @xmath51 are up to the signs of @xmath52 . for false vacuum bubbles , @xmath53 is always negative . for true vacuum bubbles ,",
    "@xmath54 is always positive . *",
    "_ change of signs of extrinsic curvatures : _ * * @xmath55 : @xmath51 do not change the sign . *",
    "* @xmath56 : @xmath57 can change the sign . * * @xmath58 : both of @xmath57 and @xmath59 can change the sign .    we listed all possible trajectories of symmetric solutions in fig .",
    "[ fig : signs_ds ] .",
    "however , for consistency , only some of them will be allowed in reality .",
    "first , we consider the collapsing solutions . due to the asymptotic behavior , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62",
    "are not allowed .",
    "therefore , possible solutions are @xmath27 and @xmath63 .",
    "second , we consider the bouncing solutions .",
    "one thing we should keep in mind is that @xmath64 and @xmath65 can not be true at the same time , as long as the tension is positive . if the shell does not change the sign of extrinsic curvatures , then @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath66 and their counterparts @xmath67 are possible .",
    "if the shell changes the sign of extrinsic curvatures , one more thing we should keep in mind is that whenever @xmath57 or @xmath59 changes the sign , it should be negative in the @xmath50 limit .",
    "then the allowed solutions are @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and their counterparts @xmath67 .",
    "especially , for true vacuum bouncing solutions , only @xmath71 is allowed , since @xmath72 in the @xmath50 limit . for false vacuum",
    "bouncing solutions , only @xmath73 and @xmath74 are allowed , since @xmath75 in the @xmath50 limit .",
    "one more interesting limit is the large tension limit ( fixing @xmath43 ) : @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "hence , this emerges to only @xmath29 .",
