    "statistical - thermal models ( cf .",
    "@xcite for recent surveys and references therein ) have enjoyed remarkable success in describing hadron multiplicities observed in both heavy - ion and elementary collisions over a wide range of energies @xcite .",
    "the final state multiplicities are reproduced in these models with very few parameters .",
    "the prominent ones are the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath2 and baryon chemical potential @xmath3 .",
    "there are further chemical potentials to be considered below .",
    "a compilation of the freeze - out parameters over the accessible range of energies reveals a continuous curve in the @xmath4 plane which may be characterized by an energy per hadron of the order of @xmath5 @xcite . while the occurrence of such a universal freeze - out curve is interesting in itself and is useful for extrapolations and interpolations as well , its particular meaning could be the approximate coincidence with the confinement border line , at least at high energies , as conjectured in @xcite .",
    "we do not touch here on the disputed question as to why also the multiplicities of the rare multi - strange hadrons seem to obey chemical equilibrium ( see @xcite ) . instead",
    ", we focus on one possible indicator of incomplete equilibrium , the strangeness saturation factor @xmath6 . this factor has been introduced @xcite to account for an apparent under - saturation of strange hadrons .",
    "various previous analyses @xcite considered such a factor as necessary to accomplish a satisfactory description of data . for sps energies , @xmath7 ,",
    "it has been shown @xcite that @xmath6 grows with increasing beam energy and centrality .",
    "first attempts @xcite , based on very restricted data sets , find also at rhic energies a preliminary indication of rising @xmath6 with increasing centrality .",
    "it is the subject of this paper to investigate in detail the dependence of the thermal parameters including @xmath6 on the centrality in collisions of au+au at @xmath0 . by now there is a sufficiently large basis of published data at this energy to allow a thorough analysis .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we recall the formulation of our employed statistical - thermal model .",
    "the analysed data are listed in section iii .",
    "our fit procedures are described in section iv and results are presented in section v. the summary and conclusions can be found in section vi .",
    "for suitably large systems at rhic collider energies , hadron multiplicities are analysed by employing the grand - canonical partition function @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 is the statistical operator of the system , @xmath2 denotes the temperature , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the chemical potentials and corresponding conserved charges in the system . to be specific ,",

    "the fiducial volume @xmath23 drops in particle ratios .",
    "@xmath24 is the degeneracy factor of particle species @xmath17 with vacuum mass @xmath25 .",
    "( the study of the effect of in - medium masses ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) is interesting because it might shed light on the chiral properties of the medium created in heavy - ion collisions at rhic . )",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) simplifies in the boltzmann approximation ( i.e. , discarding the spin - statistics factor @xmath26 ) and when neglecting the energy distribution of resonances .",
    "we use here the full expression eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) and include all hadron states with @xmath27 quarks and corresponding anti - quarks up to 1.7 or @xmath28 with masses and total widths according to the particle data group listing @xcite .",
    "the final particle numbers to be compared with experiment are @xmath29 due to decays of unstable particles with branching ratios @xmath30 .",
    "originally , such a description was thought to be justified for multiplicities measured over the entire phase - space , since many dynamical effects cancel out in ratios of hadron yields @xcite . at sufficiently high energy , such as at rhic , however , ratios of mid - rapidity yields are also found to be well described by the statistical - thermal model @xcite .",
    "in contrast to sps energies , where both mid - rapidity and fully phase space integrated data are at our disposal ( see @xcite for a comparison ) , at rhic energy of @xmath0 sufficiently many data of identified hadrons are available only at mid - rapidity .",
    "the data analysed here were compiled from phenix , phobos , brahms and star experimental results .",
    "these experiments differ in their cuts on the data .",
    "it turns out that the results for the deduced thermal freeze - out parameters depend in some cases sensitively on the employed data sets .",

    "( at rhic energies the use of boltzmann statistics introduces errors in primordial yields at the level of 10% for pions , 1.3 - 1.5% for kaons and less than one percent for all other hadrons .",

    "we note that these ratios are only slightly affected by feed - down ( using the central fit i best - fit parameters the percentage influence of feed - down is @xmath63 : 1.0% , @xmath44 : 2.9% , @xmath45 : 0.5% , @xmath46 : 3.7% , @xmath47 : 0.7% , @xmath48 : 4.2% , @xmath49 : 0.08% , and @xmath64 : 0% ) .",
    "thus , the trends in these ratios translate directly into trends in @xmath65 and @xmath66 , while they are roughly insensitive to @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "let us now consider the individual ratios and begin with @xmath67 .",
    "the experimental ratio is consistent with being flat and slightly below or equal to unity , while our model yields a @xmath68 ratio slightly above 1 ( see fig .",

    "@xmath69 drives the model ratio to very close to 1 ; deviations are due to feeding ( since @xmath3 and @xmath12 are both greater than zero ) . with only strong decays",
    "included , the ratio is less than 1 .",
    "therefore it is the influence of the weak decays that pushes the ratio above 1 .",
    "this ratio is insensitive to @xmath12 and @xmath3 : with a @xmath70 change in @xmath3 the ratio varies by 0.2% , while a @xmath70 change in @xmath12 leads to a 0.3% change in the ratio .",
    "a 0.2 change in @xmath1 furthermore affects the ratio by only 0.2% , while a @xmath70 change in @xmath2 leads to only a 0.06% change in the ratio .",
    "therefore , this ratio fixes nothing , and serves just as the motivation for setting @xmath69 .",
    "the ratio @xmath71 is above 1 ( see fig .  [ results : modelpap]b ) and drives @xmath12 to positive values . due to their much smaller errors , the star ratios are heavily weighted in the fit .",
    "this contributes to @xmath12 having a slight kink as seen in fig .",
    "[ results : graph]c .",
    "the effect of the above - quoted feeding accounts for the slightly different shape of the @xmath72 ratio compared with the @xmath65 trend which can be deduced from fig .",
    "[ results : graph ] . with this ratio removed from the fit",
    ", @xmath65 would increase steeply with centrality , driven by the corrected @xmath73 to @xmath74 double ratio .",
    "this gives @xmath74 an increasing trend . in order to keep the @xmath73 ratio flat ,",
    "@xmath66 then similarly increases which causes @xmath75 to drop .",
    "therefore , the kaon ratio is what keeps @xmath12 flattish and gives it the ` kink ' .",
    "the @xmath75 experimental ratios differ noticeably ( see fig .  [",
    "results : modelpap]c and fig .",
    "[ results : modelpap]d ) , with star being the highest .",
    "these star data points are favored in fits since they have much reduced errors ( consistently a factor of 3 less than those of phenix ) .",
    "these star ratios , however , are too high if the star @xmath73 ratio is to be simultaneously reproduced by the model ( star @xmath75 supports a lower @xmath3 as is seen when the @xmath76 s are removed from the fit , as done in fit iv ) . with @xmath76 s excluded ,",
    "the much smaller star errors lead to these @xmath75 data points being strongly favored in the mid - central and peripheral fits .",
    "this leads to a strong increase of @xmath3 with centrality .",
    "since the experimental @xmath73 ratio ( fig .  [ results : modelpap]e and f ) is flattish , they support a similar behavior for @xmath66 and @xmath65 .",
    "excluding all but the star @xmath75 points in the most central bin removes the strong increase in @xmath3 from the mid - central to central bins seen in fit iv . our suspicion that it is @xmath75 which causes @xmath3 to increase",
    "is confirmed by repeating the fits with only anti ",
    "particle - to - particle ratios included ( i.e. , all particle - to - pion ratios excluded ) . since these ratios are insensitive to @xmath1 , and @xmath2 enters only together with the chemical potentials , in these reduced fits we fixed @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( both reasonable in light of the full results ) .",
    "the approximate trends in @xmath65 and @xmath66 observed in the full fits were reproduced using just these ratios . with",
    "the @xmath75 ratio excluded , the steady increase in @xmath3 disappears ; instead @xmath66 decreases similarly to @xmath65 as driven by the flatness in the @xmath73 ratio .    the ratio @xmath79 ( see fig .  [",
    "results : modelpap]g ) depends strongly on @xmath65 and @xmath66 and is little affected by feed - down .",
    "similar fractional errors to the uncorrected @xmath73 ratio means both are treated equally in fits .",
    "although consistent within errors , the model trend decreases slightly with centrality , while the data are consistent with a weak increase . comparing this experimental ratio with @xmath73 , the @xmath74 to @xmath73 double ratio increases",
    "thus , @xmath65 is driven up particularly from the mid - central to central bin .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the @xmath72 ratio leads to a kink in the trend for @xmath12 .",
    "this effect wins over the influence of the @xmath80 to @xmath76 double ratio which suggests an increase in @xmath65 .",
    "unfortunately there is no centrality information on the ratio @xmath81 .",
    "such data would allow even better determination of @xmath12 .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ results : modelpap]h , our model results agree fairly well with the data for the central bin .",
    "the particle - to - pion ratios read in the boltzmann approximation neglecting width @xmath82 i.e. , qualitatively , mixed particle ratios allow the determination of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and hence the @xmath83 s independently . whereas the particle - to - anti  particle ratios feature just the combination @xmath84",
    ", the primordial particle - to - pion ratios feature also @xmath2 in the combination @xmath85 .",
    "this allows the temperature to be fixed and then , given the values of @xmath84 fixed by the particle - to - anti - particle ratios , the chemical potentials are determined .",
    "however , feed - down plays an important role in these ratios , so that the final observed ratios differ from the ratios of primordial densities quite substantially .",
    "this makes a detailed analysis of the influence of these ratios on the parameters much more difficult than in the case of the particle - to - anti  particle ratios .",
    "in fact , for the best - fit parameters corresponding to fit i of the central bin , more than 70% of @xmath86 s come from decays .",
    "a simple analysis shows how the ratio @xmath85 varies with temperature for a number of hadron species @xmath17 : lowering the temperature has the effect of bringing the particle - to - pion ratios down .",
    "furthermore , the fractional effect of changing the temperature is greater for the heavier particles .    after these general remarks let us consider in some detail the comparison of our model with data .",
    "the ratio @xmath87 ( fig .  [ results : modelppi]a ) is reasonably well reproduced in the fits . since the errors on the phenix and star experimental ratios are similar , neither is heavily biased in the fit",
    ". the phenix data rise more rapidly than the star data ( especially from the mid - central to central bin ) .",
    "since the particle - to - anti - particle ratios support a centrality - independent @xmath65 , the experimental @xmath88 ratios drive an increase in strangeness saturation , with the phenix data supporting a steeper increase in @xmath1 than the star data ( see fig .  [ results : graph]d ) . in fit",
    "i and ii @xmath88 is over - predicted .",
    "in contrast , the uncorrected @xmath89 and @xmath90 are under - estimated ( small fractional errors on @xmath90 mean that this ratio strongly influences the fit ) . with the @xmath80 s removed in fit iii",
    "the star @xmath88 data are well reproduced owing to the drop in @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the big drop in this ratio when @xmath76 s are excluded from the fit is due to the further drop in @xmath1 and @xmath2 in fit iv seen in fig .",
    "[ results : graph ] .",
    "the effect of this drop is somewhat lessened by the accompanying drop in @xmath65 in the central and mid - central bins .",
    "furthermore , the kaon to pion ratios are least affected by the temperature change in fit iv .    the increase in the ratio @xmath91 with centrality ( fig .",
    "[ results : modelppi]b ) also drives @xmath1 to increase . in the full fits ( fits i - iii ) it is somewhat over - estimated ( a similar result is found in @xcite ) , while the exclusion of the @xmath76 s ( fit iv ) results in much better agreement .",
    "this is owing to the reduced @xmath1 in fit iv . comparing the results for the ratios @xmath92 and @xmath93 in figs .",
    "[ results : modelppi]a and b one gets the impression that the phenix @xmath92 data is compatible with star s @xmath93 data , while the good fit in fit iii of star s @xmath92 data result in a ratio @xmath93 being at the upper limits of the error bars from star . the central @xmath94 ratio reproduction by the model ( fig .",

    "excluded , @xmath98 is well reproduced , while @xmath89 is greatly underpredicted .",
    "therefore , @xmath98 drives @xmath2 down , while @xmath89 tends to raise @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    the flatness of the ratio @xmath99 ( fig .",
    "[ results : modelppi]h ) supports a centrality - independent @xmath1 . in fits",
    "i and ii there is fair agreement with the model , while this ratio is greatly under - estimated in fit iv owing to the greatly reduced @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the increasing trend of the model results is due to the increase in @xmath1 with centrality and the fact that @xmath100 .",
    "the increase of the ratio @xmath101 ( fig .",
    "[ results : modelppi]i ) drives @xmath66 to increase as well as @xmath1 . on the other hand , it causes @xmath65 to drop .",
    "again there is fair agreement with the model in fits i and ii , while this ratio is greatly under - estimated in fit iv .",
    "our final conclusion is that fits i - ii give a quite satisfactory description of most ratios , with the exception of @xmath93 , @xmath94 and corrected @xmath96 .",

    "the @xmath75 ratio drives @xmath66 up , which wins over @xmath73 s attempts to make @xmath65 and @xmath66 behave similarly .",
    "the temperature and strangeness saturation are fixed by the particle - to - pion ratios . the observed increase in @xmath1",
    "is driven predominantly by the increase in the @xmath88 ratio and the flatness of @xmath65 as fixed by the @xmath72 ratio .",
    "a possible extension of the present work is the analysis of saturation in the non - strange sector , parameterized by @xmath106 being a factor similar to @xmath6 @xcite . since our fits to the data",
    "deliver reasonably small values of @xmath39 we believe , however , that there is not too much room left for sizeable deviations of @xmath106 from unity .",
    "this issue deserves a separate investigation .",
    "more tempting is the analysis of data for @xmath107 .",
    "the explorative study in @xcite points to a similar behavior of @xmath6 as we find for @xmath0 .",
    "even more interesting is to test heavy flavor production ; due to their larger intrinsic masses , heavy flavors should have a higher sensitivity to the medium .",
    "in particular , hadrons with open and hidden charm may require a corresponding factor @xmath108 .",
