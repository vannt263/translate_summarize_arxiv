    "a useful function in the study of phase transitions is the legendre transform of free energy .",
    "this function , which can be interpreted as the effective potential whose minima represent different possible states , gives an intuitive ( and quantitative ) description of phase transitions .",
    "consider for example ferromagnetic systems . in this case",
    "the effective potential is a function of magnetisation .",
    "the ferromagnetic transition corresponds to the splitting of the paramagnetic minimum in the two ferromagnetic minima .",
    "a vanishing external magnetic field breaks the up - down symmetry and fixes the system in one of the two possible ferromagnetic states .",
    "+ generally , frustrated systems are characterised by a complicated energy landscape , which can give rise eventually to the existence of many possible states . in this case",
    "it is not possible to characterise the states a priori studying the various possible schemes of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "thus , the effective potential has to be computed as a function of the averaged microscopic configuration and this is what thouless , anderson and palmer did for the sherrington - kirkpatrick model .",
    "they derived the legendre transform of the free energy with respect to the local magnetic fields @xmath8 , obtaining the effective potential ( called now tap free energy ) which is a function of the local magnetisations @xmath9 for a fixed ( but typical ) disorder configuration . at low temperature",
    "the tap free energy has an infinite number of minima ; each one corresponds to a different possible state .",
    "it has been shown that their weighted sum ( with the boltzmann weight ) gives back equilibrium results@xcite found by the replica @xcite or the cavity method@xcite .    in this section",
    "we show how the static tap free energy can be derived for mean field spin glass models . in this way we present in a simple case the strategy which we will follow to compute dynamical tap equations .",
    "the derivations of the static tap equations presented in the literature @xcite seem to be quite often model dependent and rather involved .",
    "therefore we hope that this section may be also useful to show an easy way to obtain the tap free energy for a generic mean field model",
    ". it does not matter if one considers spherical or ising spins , two body or many body interactions .    a straightforward way to compute the tap free energy for mean field (",
    "completely connected ) spin glass models consists in finding a good perturbative expansion such that using the properties of typical disorder configurations it is possible to show that only a finite number of terms of the perturbation series does not vanish .",
    "+ following this strategy we will compute the legendre transform of the free energy with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "one may wonder why we legendre transform also with respect to @xmath11 ; the reason is that otherwise the perturbation expansion would contain an infinite number of terms .",
    "+ note that for ising spins the average @xmath11 is trivial , so we will legendre transform only with respect to magnetisations .",
    "this is a peculiarity of the ising spins , which disappears for spherical ( or potts ) spins and in the dynamical case .",
    "we are finally in position to define the tap free energy @xmath12 which depends on the magnetisation @xmath9 at every site @xmath13 and on the spherical parameter @xmath14 ( for ising spins @xmath14 is absent ) .",
    "@xmath15 is the legendre transform of the `` true '' free energy : @xmath16 for ising spins @xmath17 and for spherical spins @xmath18 .",
    "the lagrange multipliers @xmath19 fix the magnetisation at each site @xmath13 : @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which is present only for spherical models , enforces the condition @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath6 denotes the thermal average and @xmath23 is the number of spins .",
    "+ once @xmath24 is known , the equation @xmath25 fixes the spherical constraint ( @xmath26 ) and gives the spherical multiplier as a function of @xmath9 , whereas @xmath27 are the tap equations , which fix the values of local magnetisations .",
    "+ in the following we focus on the p - spin hamiltonian : @xmath28 where the couplings are gaussian variables with zero mean and average @xmath29 .",
    "the standard perturbation expansion for the generalised potential @xmath24 is rather involved @xcite and can not be directly applied to the ising case .",
    "thus , we prefer to follow the approach developed for the sherrington - kirkpatrick model by t. plefka @xcite and a. georges and s. yedidia @xcite because is simple and can be directly applied to all mean field spin glass models .",
    "+ they obtained the tap free energy for the sherrington - kirkpatrick model expanding @xmath30 in powers of @xmath31 around @xmath32 : @xmath33 for a general system this corresponds to a @xmath34 expansion ( @xmath35 being the spatial dimension ) around mean field theory @xcite ; so it is not surprising that for mean field spin glass models only a finite number of terms survives .",
    "the zeroth- and first - order terms give the `` nave '' tap free energy , whereas the second term is the onsager reaction term .    from the definition of @xmath30 given in equation ( [ gdef ] ) ,",
    "we find for ising spins : @xmath36\\ ] ] and for spherical spins .",
    "a term in @xmath37 , that does not depend on @xmath14 and @xmath9 , has no influence on thermodynamics . ] : @xmath38 these are the entropies of non interacting ising or spherical spins constrained to have magnetisation @xmath9 .",
    "+ the linear term in the power expansion ( [ expgamma ] ) of the tap free energy equals : @xmath39 where the last sum is present only for spherical models . the second and the third term are zero because of lagrange conditions ; moreover at @xmath32 the spins are decoupled so all the thermal averages are trivial : @xmath40 this `` mean field '' energy together with the zeroth - order term gives the standard mean field theory , which becomes exact for infinite - ranged ferromagnetic system .",
    "the onsager reaction term comes from the quadratic term in the expansion ( [ expgamma ] ) : @xmath41 to compute this term we have used the following maxwell relations : @xmath42 using the statistical properties of the couplings it is easy to check that the only terms giving a contribution of the order of @xmath23 correspond to the squares of @xmath43 : @xmath44 using again the statistical properties of the couplings and neglecting terms giving a contribution of an order smaller than @xmath23 we find that the reaction term depends on @xmath9 through the overlap @xmath45 only : @xmath46 higher derivatives in equation ( [ expgamma ] ) lead to terms which can be neglected because they are not of order of n @xcite ; so collecting ( [ g0ising]),([g0sferi]),([g1b]),([g2c1 ] ) and ( [ g2c ] ) we find the tap free energy for ising and spherical p - spin models .",
    "deriving the free energy with respect to magnetisations @xmath9 and the spherical parameter @xmath14 ( in the spherical case ) one finds the tap equations .",
    "for instance for spherical spins we find : @xmath47 @xmath48 these equations admit for certain temperatures an infinite number of solutions .",
    "this is a fundamental characteristic and difficulty of mean field spin glasses .",
    "it has been shown that the weighted sum of the local minima of the tap free energy gives back equilibrium results found by the replica or the cavity method @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the tap free energy of a stable solution @xmath51 of tap equations .",
    "the different tap states can be grouped with respect to their free energy ; then the partition function can be rewritten as : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the logarithm of the number of tap states with free energy @xmath54 and is called complexity @xcite . + note that states which do not have the minimum free energy can dominate the sum in ( [ zf ] ) if their number is very large .",
    "finally , we note that it was crucial to legendre transform also with respect to @xmath55 , otherwise in ( [ expgamma ] ) the derivatives higher than the second order would not vanish and an infinite number of terms should be re - summed .",
    "this re - summation is automatically achieved if one legendre transform also with respect to @xmath55 .      in the following we recall very briefly some results on the thermodynamics and the dynamics of the p - spin spherical model which will be useful for the asymptotic analysis of the dynamical tap equations .",
    "a detailed review has been done by barrat @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics of the p - spin spherical model has been studied within the replica approach in @xcite , whereas the tap equations have been analysed in @xcite . + it has been shown that there is a high temperature regime @xmath56 , @xmath57 , for which the paramagnetic state @xmath58 dominates the partition function , i.e. @xmath59 . + there is also an intermediate temperature regime @xmath60 in which the partition function is dominated by an exponential number ( in @xmath23 ) of states , i.e. the related complexity is different from zero .",
    "in this case the free energy is given by : @xmath61 finally , there is a low temperature regime @xmath62 in which the sum in ( [ zf ] ) is dominated by the lowest states in free energy .",
    "their number is infinite but not exponential in @xmath23 , so the related complexity is zero .",
    "+ in the intermediate temperature regime there is a non trivial distribution of states , but the equilibrium free energy ( @xmath63 ) is equal to the paramagnetic one ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "note that the paramagnetic state does not exist in this temperature regime @xcite , but the equality between @xmath63 and @xmath64 implies that the system seems to be in the paramagnetic phase yet .",
    "actually , in the simplest replica analysis this phase is still described by the replica symmetric solution .",
    "+ the thermodynamic phase transition is at @xmath65 . at this temperature",
    "the one step replica symmetry breaking solution becomes stable and for @xmath62 the system is in the glassy phase .",
    "the dynamics of the p - spin spherical model for random initial conditions ( corresponding to a quench from infinite temperature ) has been studied in @xcite ; whereas the dynamics taking an initial condition , which is a typical equilibrium configuration at a certain temperature @xmath66 , has been analysed in @xcite . + it has been shown that for random initial conditions , actually the physical case , the p - spin spherical model has a transition at @xmath67 ( which is higher than @xmath65 ) . above the dynamical transition temperature",
    "there is a coexistence of some non trivial tap states with the paramagnetic state which dominates thermodynamics .",
    "starting from a random initial condition the system thermalizes within the paramagnetic state , however an initial condition belonging to a stable tap state leads always to an equilibrium dynamics inside this state . between the static and the dynamic transition temperatures the paramagnetic state is fractured into many tap states .",
    "starting from a random initial condition the system ends up ageing and the asymptotic values of some one time quantities are equal to the corresponding ones of the threshold states , which are the highest ( in free energy ) tap states . for lower temperatures the static",
    "is dominated by the lowest tap states , whereas the dynamics is still dominated by the highest tap states .",
    "+ moreover the peculiarity of the spectrum of the free energy hessian for threshold states , which is a shifted semi - circle law with minimum eigenvalue equal to zero , has been used to give an interpretation of ageing as the evolution in a landscape with many flat directions @xcite .",

    "indeed in @xcite the low temperature dynamics has been studied starting from an initial condition thermalized at a temperature @xmath66 between the statical and the dynamical transition temperatures .",

    "therefore it is natural to associate to this solution a random initial condition , which is not correlated with any particular stable tap state .",
    "+ to study how the local magnetisations vanish at large times , the `` mean field '' energy term in ( [ tm ] ) can be neglected because is of the order of @xmath182 .",
    "moreover we can substitute to all terms which multiply @xmath9 their asymptotic values , finding that ( [ tm ] ) reduces to : @xmath183 this is exactly the same equation satisfied by @xmath101 and @xmath102 for a fixed and finite @xmath184 and a very large value of @xmath185 @xcite . as a consequence the local magnetisations and ( for a fixed @xmath184 ) the correlation and the response functions go to zero at large times in the same way and because of the same mechanism : fixed any configuration reached during the dynamics , two different typical noise histories bring the system in two completely uncorrelated configurations @xcite .",
    "besides , we remark that the local magnetisations vanish at large time , whereas the correlation function tends in the fdt regime to the overlap of the threshold states .",

    "+ therefore we have found that this asymptotic solution is very similar to the one associated to random initial conditions .",
    "the only difference is that for the latter the local magnetisations vanish because of the spreading of the dynamical probability measure at finite times .",
    "as we have suggested in the previous section , it seems that the dynamical probability measure ( starting from random initial conditions ) tends toward a static probability measure which is broken in separate components , i.e. the threshold states .",
    "whereas for the asymptotic solution studied in this section the effects due to the spreading of the dynamical probability measure are absent and the system seems to equilibrate ( in the fdt time regime ) within a threshold state . as a consequence it seems natural that the initial conditions related to this asymptotic solution are the configurations typically reached in the long - time dynamics ( starting from a random initial condition ) .",

    "the analysis of the equations of motion @xcite for @xmath201 confirms and strengthens the previous interpretation of @xmath80 .    in the following we analyse the slow evolution of local magnetisations",
    "note that since the overlap and the correlation functions are equal in the ageing regime , one can obtain the slow dynamical behaviour of the correlation and the response functions starting from the evolution of @xmath0 .",
    "+ as in the previous section the equations on the local magnetisations can be rewritten as a gradient descent in the free energy landscape with the extra spherical multiplier @xmath173 and the extra magnetic fields @xmath202 going to zero at large times . therefore ( [ gradiente ] ) implies that @xmath203    thus , even if the analysis of the fdt regime shows that at very large times the system has almost thermalized within a threshold state , the fact that the overlap function shows an ageing behaviour implies that magnetisations do not tend toward a particular threshold state . in other words the local magnetisations continue to evolve forever ( even if more and more slowly ) and their large time limit does not exist .",
    "this already happens for the spherical sherrington - kirkpatrick model , for which an exact analytical solution is available @xcite .",
    "+ as it is implicitly contained in the slow dynamic assumption , the local magnetisations are ( asymptotically ) constant on time - scales associated to the fdt regime and their evolution is on time - scales associated to the ageing regime . because of almost flat directions @xmath173 and @xmath174 play a fundamental role and are responsible for ageing .",
    "in fact at large times the dynamics takes place only along almost flat directions and these vanishing function of time act as a vanishing source of drift , so the larger is the time , the weaker is the drift and the slower is the evolution : the system ages .      at finite times",
    "the dynamics can not be represented as an evolution in the free energy landscape because the onsager reaction term in ( [ tm ] ) is non - markovian .",

    "however , also in this case , a description of the long - time dynamics as an evolution in the free energy landscape makes sense , providing that the effects due to the spreading of the dynamical probability measure are separated from the slow motion of the system .",
    "in particular we have explicitly shown that slow dynamics is due to the motion in the flat directions of the free energy landscape in presence of a vanishing source of drift . + these results clarify and strengthen the relationship between long - times dynamics and local properties of the free energy landscape , which was already found in @xcite .",
    "+ moreover we have shown that the local properties of the _ energy _ landscape seen during the dynamical evolution do not change qualitatively at the dynamical glass transition but at a higher temperature @xmath7 , which is related to the damage spreading transition @xcite .",
    "this indicates that at the dynamical glass transition the energy landscape seen by the system remains locally the same , whereas its _ global _ properties change and this can be observed by analysing the _ local _ properties of the free energy landscape .",
    "finally , we remark that there is still an important question which remains open and which has been clarified only for the zero temperature dynamics of the p - spin spherical model @xcite : even if it is known that the tap states having flat directions in the free energy landscape dominate the off - equilibrium dynamics , it is not clear why starting from a random initial condition the system goes toward these states .",
    "the dynamical tap equations are strongly non - markovian for any finite time .",
    "this result suggests that the matching between a certain initial condition ( e.g. a random initial condition ) and the asymptotic regime ( slow dynamics at the threshold level ) can not be explained in terms of the static free energy and is a purely dynamical problem .",

    "<S> the tap free energy was computed and studied in detail @xcite and an analytic solution of the asymptotic out of equilibrium regime is available @xcite . to understand the reasons of the connection found in @xcite between tap free energy and the asymptotic behaviour </S>",
    "<S> , we will compute the equations satisfied by the local magnetisations @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 means the average over the thermal noises ) without performing the average over disorder . </S>",
    "<S> this is the generalisation to dynamics of the thouless , anderson and palmer approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + we will show that the dynamical evolution of the local magnetisations corresponds to a relaxation in the free energy landscape ( in a sense which we will precise ) only for very large times and for particular initial conditions ; in all the other cases the dynamics is characterised by a memory term , which makes the evolution non - markovian . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the study of the dynamical tap equations shows that the stationary points of the static free energy and the free energy hessian in these points are closely related to the long - time dynamical behaviour , as was already found from the solution of the equations on the correlation and the response functions in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results explicitly show that the scenario for slow dynamics found in @xcite remains valid also at finite temperature : ageing is due to the motion in the flat directions of the free energy landscape in presence of a vanishing source of drift . </S>",
    "<S> + finally we show that already for the simple case of the p - spin spherical model an analysis of the local properties of the _ energy _ landscape is not adequate to identify the dynamical glass transition . </S>",
    "<S> we will compute the spectrum of the energy hessian for dynamical configurations seen during the dynamical evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvectors of the energy hessian are called instantaneous normal modes in liquid theory and have been introduced to represent the short - time dynamics of liquids within a harmonic description @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + we will show that the local properties of the energy landscape seen during the dynamical evolution do not change qualitatively at the dynamical glass transition but at a higher temperature @xmath7 , which seems to be related to the damage spreading transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that at the dynamical glass transition the energy landscape seen by the system remains locally the same , whereas its _ global _ properties change and this can be observed by analysing the _ local _ properties of the free energy landscape .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organised as follows : in section i we derive the static tap free energy for mean field spin glass models . </S>",
    "<S> this section serves as an introduction to the method applied in the following to derive the dynamical tap free energy . in section ii this method is applied to derive the dynamical tap equations via the analogy between the dynamical theory and a supersymmetric static theory . in section iii the asymptotic analysis of the dynamical tap equations </S>",
    "<S> is performed . in section </S>",
    "<S> iv the local properties of the energy landscape seen during the dynamical evolution is analysed . </S>",
    "<S> finally we conclude in section v. </S>"
