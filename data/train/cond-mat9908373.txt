    "two - dimensional electron systems in a strong magnetic field have been providing various fascinating phenomena for the last two decades of this twentieth century . the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe)@xcite and fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe)@xcite",
    "are observed around the integral filling factor and rational filling factor with an odd denominator@xcite respectively .",
    "these effects are caused by the formation of the incompressible liquid state with a finite energy gap .",
    "the iqhe state has a landau level s energy gap or zeeman s energy gap and fqhe state has an energy gap due to the coulomb interaction.@xcite remarkable progress of the composite fermion ( cf ) theory@xcite for the fqhe shed light on the fermi - liquid - like state at the half - filled lowest landau level .",
    "evidences for the fermi - liquid - like state were obtained in many experiments.@xcite it is believed that the state is compressible isotropic state and has a circular fermi surface .",
    "recent experiments at the half - filled landau levels have revealed the anisotropic nature of the compressible states . at the half - filled third and higher landau levels ,",
    "highly anisotropic behavior was observed in the magnetoresistance.@xcite at the half - filled lowest and second landau levels , transition to the anisotropic state was also observed in the presence of the periodic potential@xcite or in - plane magnetic field@xcite respectively .",
    "although the origin of the anisotropy is still unknown , the unidirectional charge density wave ( ucdw ) state is a candidate for the anisotropic state .",
    "theoretical works in higher landau levels showed possibility of the ucdw.@xcite recent theoretical works in lower landau levels support the ucdw or liquid - crystal state.@xcite in this paper we investigate the compressible charge density wave ( ccdw ) states , which include the ucdw state and compressible wigner crystal ( cwc ) state , in the several lower landau levels . as a result ,",
    "the ucdw states are found to be the lowest energy states in the ccdw states at the half - filled landau levels .",
    "the ccdw state is a gapless state with an anisotropic fermi surface and has a periodically modulated charge density . using the von neumann lattice@xcite representation",
    ", we construct the ccdw state and calculate the charge density profile and hartree - fock energy self - consistently .",
    "the von neumann lattice representation has a quite useful property in studying the quantum hall system with the periodic potential.@xcite the lattice structure of the von neumann lattice can be adjusted to the periodic potential by varying the modular parameter of the unit cell . in the present case",
    "the periodic potential is caused by the charge density modulation through the coulomb interaction.@xcite if the translational invariance on the lattice is unbroken , a fermi surface is formed .    in the hartree - fock approximation , we show that the self - consistency equation for the ccdw has two types of solution at the half - filling .",
    "the one has a belt - shaped fermi - sea corresponding to the ucdw and the other has a diamond - shaped fermi - sea corresponding to the cwc . for the belt - shaped fermi sea , one - direction of the momentum space is filled and the other direction is partially filled .",
    "therefore the ucdw is regarded as a collection of the one - dimensional lattice fermi - gas systems which was called the quantum hall gas ( qhg ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the ucdw state , there are two length scales , the wave length of the ucdw , @xmath0 and fermi wave length of the lattice fermions , @xmath1 .",

    "therefore the backscattering effect strongly affects on the conductance in the ucdw .    to conclude this section",
    ", we point out a subtle problem concerned with the k - invariance and sliding mode . in an ordinary one - dimensional system ,",
    "the difference of the chemical potentials between the left and right edge of the fermi sea yields the net electric current . in the one - dimensional system of the ucdw ,",
    "however , the difference of the chemical potentials can be canceled out by sliding the fermi sea in eqs .",
    "( [ self1 ] ) and ( [ self2 ] ) , thanks to the k - invariance .",
    "then there is no net electric current .",
    "this contradicts the above assertion apparently . as mentioned before , the translation in the momentum space is equal to the translation of the charge density in the real space . in other words , to slide the fermi sea is the same as to slide the ccdw in the real space .",
    "the sliding mode is expected to be pinned by impurities .",
    "therefore the violation of the k - invariance due to pinning of the ccdw can remedy the contradiction .",
    "in this paper we have studied the ccdw state whose periodicity of the charge density coincides with that of the von neumann lattice . the ccdw state is gapless and has an anisotropic fermi surface .",
    "we obtained two types of the ccdw state , the ucdw state and cwc state . by calculating the hartree - fock energy ,",
    "the ucdw is found to have a lower energy at the half - filled landau levels .",
    "furthermore , the wave length dependence of the energy , the density profile , and the kinetic energy of the ucdw are calculated numerically . as a result",
    ", it is found that the amplitude of the ucdw and bandwidth of the landau level decrease with the increasing @xmath5 and a quasi - stable state appears for @xmath117 .",
    "the ucdw state has a belt - shaped fermi - sea .",
    "consequently the system consists of many one - dimensional lattice fermi - gas systems which extend to the uniform direction .",
    "formation of this structure could be the origin of the anisotropy observed in experiments . to confirm this speculation , experimental works for detecting the wave length of the ucdw and theoretical works to include fluctuations around the mean field solution are necessary . since there is no energy gap in the ccdw state , the fluctuation effect",
    "might be large compared with the gapfull cdw state .",
    "actually fradkin and kivelson proposed a rich phase diagram by considering fluctuations around the stripe - ordered state .",
    "we believe that the von neumann lattice formalism presents an appropriate scheme to study the fluctuation effects around the mean field .",
    "recently a new insulating state is discovered around the quarter - filled third landau level.@xcite this state seems gapfull and to have an integral quantized hall conductance .",
    "these facts suggest that the state is a gapfull cdw state which is different from the ccdw .",
    "the cdw state whose periodicity is @xmath118 times that of the von neumann lattice is gapfull and has @xmath119 bands with @xmath120-hold degeneracy.@xcite in the presence of a magnetic field and periodic potential , the hall conductance of the free electron system in the gap region is equal to the chern number.@xcite thus the observed quantized hall conductance is probably the chern number of the periodic potential problem .",
    "the transition between this gapfull cdw and ccdw studied in this paper is an interesting future problem .",
