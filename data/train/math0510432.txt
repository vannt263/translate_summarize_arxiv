    "[ prop : largerspherical ] , @xmath580 is the multiangle of hyperbolic cone manifold , hence a hyperbolic orbifold .",
    "notice that this orbifold can not be spherical , because its fundamental group is infinite .",
    "consider now a path of cone multiangles between @xmath575 and @xmath580 which is decreasing along each component . by proposition  [ prop : largerspherical ]",
    "every multiangle in this path corresponds to a hyperbolic cone structure .",
    "however , sphericity must fail at some multiangle of this path , because @xmath580 is not the multiangle of a spherical structure . by the arguments in the proof of proposition  [ prop :",
    "completesubmfld ] , when sphericity fails we find precisely a euclidean structure , and we have reduced to the first case of incompatibility between hyperbolic and euclidean structures .    the following proposition is also used in the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "[ prop : angle0 ] every multiangle in @xmath581 with at least one angle @xmath327 is the multiangle of a hyperbolic cone structure .    by (",
    "1.5 ) , the smooth part of @xmath0 is hyperbolic . applying thurston s dehn filling theorem , we have the proposition for a neighborhood of the origin . to cover the rest of the multiangles",
    ", we just have to enlarge some of the angles , keeping the other ones equal to zero ( i.e.  complete cusps ) .",
    "thus we have a lower bound on the cone angles , and in addition the diameter is infinity . applying the results of @xcite , we can enlarge each one of the cone angles up to @xmath3 . notice that some convergence results of @xcite apply to cone manifolds without essential turnovers . in our case",
    "there are no turnovers by remark  [ rem : smallness ] except if we allow cusped turnovers ( i.e.turnovers with some cone angle 0 ) .",
    "however cusped turnovers are not a problem in those arguments , because all cone angles are @xmath3 , and therefore they can not converge to a euclidean cone 2-manifold .",

    "this remark can be easily proved adapting the arguments of the proof of hyperbolic dehn filling for orbifolds in ( * ? ? ?",

    "proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] : _ assume first that @xmath0 is a euclidean cone manifold as in the statement and all cone angles are @xmath22 . then using the regeneration results of section  [ sec : pathsofstructures ] and proposition  [ prop : largerspherical ] , every point in @xmath23 is the multiangle of a hyperbolic cone structure on @xmath0 .    assuming that at least one of the angles of @xmath0 is @xmath3",
    ", then there exists a spherical cone structure on @xmath0 with all cone angles @xmath22 , again by section  [ sec : pathsofstructures ] and proposition  [ prop : largerspherical ] .",
    "we consider all segments in @xmath581 starting at @xmath582 and ending at some point with at least one coordinate zero .",
    "the first point of the segment is the multiangle of a spherical cone structure and the last one is the multiangle of a hyperbolic one , by proposition  [ prop : angle0 ] . by remark  [ rem : opennessat0 ]",
    ", we can assume that the multiangle of the hyperbolic structure lies in the open cube @xmath23 .",
    "starting at @xmath583 , we move along the segment by decreasing the cone angles and obtaining a family of spherical cone manifolds",
    ". this family can not be spherical all the time because the endpoint of the segment corresponds to a hyperbolic structure and they are incompatible by lemma  [ lem : incompatibility ] .",
    "since all cone angles are @xmath3 , then the end of the spherical subsegment is the multiangle of a euclidean structure , by the same argument as in proposition  [ prop : completesubmfld ] . by the regeneration results of section  [ sec : pathsofstructures ] and",
    "proposition  [ prop : largerspherical ] , we connect the multiangle of this euclidean structure to the endpoint of the segment by multiangles of hyperbolic cone structures .",
    "the previous argument shows that every point in @xmath23 is the multiangle of a constant curvature cone structure on @xmath0 , and that @xmath29 is a hypersurface that divides @xmath23 in two components @xmath27 and @xmath26 corresponding respectively to hyperbolic and spherical multiangles .    for the uniqueness , notice first that in lemma  [ lem : incompatibility ] we establish incompatibility between hyperbolic , spherical and euclidean for a given multiangle . global rigidity for hyperbolic and spherical structures",
    "is proved in @xcite . using local rigidity of the regenerations ( corollary  [ cor : lrr ] ) and global rigidity for the hyperbolic structures , we get global rigidity for the euclidean ones .",
    "in this section we illustrate the main theorem for cone manifold structures on the 3-sphere with singular locus given by the whitehead link , which is the 2-component link depicted in figure [ fig : whitehead ] .",
    "furthermore we discuss geometric structures corresponding to multiangles contained in the boundary of @xmath584 ^ 2 $ ] to some extent .",

    "alternatively , one can proceed as follows : let @xmath44 denote the complement of the whitehead link in @xmath585 .",

    "we may write @xmath600 and @xmath601 with @xmath602 and @xmath603 the cone angles around the two components of @xmath587 .",
    "rotational parts of euclidean holonomies correspond to representations as above where in addition @xmath604 and @xmath605 fail to be local coordinates .",
    "this is precisely the locus where the discriminant of @xmath101 computed with respect to the variable @xmath244 vanishes .",
    "the discriminant is given by the following polynomial : @xmath606 for the resulting curve of multiangles of euclidean cone manifold structures see figure [ fig : euclideanregion ] .",
    "for multiangles contained in some parts of the boundary of @xmath607 ^ 2 $ ] we can construct cone manifold structures as well using our main theorem : for multiangles of the form @xmath608 , @xmath609 , resp .",
