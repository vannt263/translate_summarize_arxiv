    "active fluids are ubiquitous in biology and include the cell cytoskeleton @xcite , bacteria films and even schools of fish @xcite .",
    "the common trait of these systems is that they are driven out of equilibrium at the level of their constituents , which interact hydrodynamically with their neighbours . in this paper",
    "we use a continuum model of active fluids developed in @xcite where the constituent fluid particles generate local force dipoles .",
    "these systems demonstrate aspects of cytoskeletal dynamics in cells or collections of microswimmers such as bacteria , which generate dipolar stresses in their surrounding medium .",
    "recent experimental work has shown that it is possible to confine these systems to droplets or vesicles _ in vitro _ to isolate their dynamics and observe emergent behaviour @xcite . with these systems as motivation we consider two limits of the active fluid model , firstly the case of an isotropically ordered active fluid confined to a droplet interface and secondly the case of a droplet of active fluid with strong local polar ordering .",
    "we are able to capture the full dynamics of these two systems in a single computational model that predicts interesting phase behaviour in both cases .",
    "we have developed numerical simulations to model active fluids confined within and on the interface of deformable droplets in 2-dimensions .",
    "the simulations are based on the immersed boundary method introduced by peskin @xcite to model interactions between fluids and elastic interfaces in biological systems .",
    "this method models the droplet interface as a 1d lagrangian mesh of points which interacts with a fixed fluid mesh via a numerical analogue of the dirac delta function ( as outlined in the methods section ) .",
    "the advantage of this method over phase field methods ( such as @xcite ) is that we can track and numerically conserve quantities defined on the interface naturally in the simulation and potentially model a wide ranges of interface properties .",
    "moreover , we can easily incorporate external boundaries in a self - consistent manner .",
    "however , a limitation of this method is that it is significantly more difficult to consider droplet separation or combination , phenomena which are captured automatically by phase field methods .     applying the immersed boundary method to active fluids is a natural step as the properties and geometries of biological interfaces can be complex .",
    "we simulate the coupled dynamics of active particles on the interface as well as in the droplet bulk in a self consistent way .",
    "firstly , this allows us to exactly conserve the mass of active particles within the drop ( as shown in methods ) .",
    "this leads to interesting droplet dynamics including transitions from stationary to motile and back to stationary as a function of activity ( see results : active polar fluid ) .",
    "secondly , we show that this method can also consistently model an active polar fluid droplet and compare the results of these to previous studies in the literature as well as characterising previously unpredicted states .",
    "furthermore , we have made improvements to previous fluid immersed boundary models by ensuring conservation of droplet area ( to be consistent with incompressibility ) and to reduce numerical instabilities in the boundary due to the finite sized mesh ( as shown in methods ) .",
    "these are necessary improvements in order to model these active systems where flows are generated locally .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first introduce the analytical equations describing the system in the following section , and then the numerical implementation of these is presented in the methods section . following this we present tests of the simulations and compare with other simulation data .",
    "we then present some interesting results from these simulations for the two cases of active droplets discussed .",
    "these include spontaneous symmetry breaking leading to steady swimming states , droplet deformation , and oscillating states .    in the discussion section",
    "we describe potential uses for these simulations and extensions to these that could be performed in the future to investigate even more biologically relevant systems .",
    "in particular we discuss various ways that confinement can be added to this model .",
    "furthermore , we outline how to extend these simulations to 3 dimensions and how we expect the results presented here to generalise to the 3d case .",
    "finally , we also discuss potential experimental realisation of these simple systems _ in vitro _ and how these simulations can be used to simulate multicomponent active droplets or droplets with active and passive components .",
    "we construct numerical simulations of active fluid droplets using an immersed boundary ( ib ) method for modelling fluid - fluid interactions .",
    "the ib method was originally formulated for modelling fluid - structure interactions in biological problems , where the structure can be represented by elastic fibres @xcite . in our simulations , we follow the work of @xcite which adapts this to fluid - fluid interactions in a 2d domain . we begin by considering an infinitely thin , closed interface @xmath0 represented by the position vector @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a lagrangian coordinate along the curve @xmath0 and @xmath3 is time . the force density on this interface due to the surface tension",
    "is given in 2d by :    @xmath4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the surface tension , @xmath6 is the tangent vector to the surface and @xmath7 .",
    "this acts as an external force on the fluids , which can be translated to a 2d force density via the 2d dirac delta function as follows    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the position vector in the medium .",
    "the 2d dirac delta is defined by the identity    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the total fluid domain , consisting of fluids labelled 0 and 1 . in the case of incompressible stokes flow , which we assume here , force balance in the fluid dictates :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the fluid viscosity , @xmath14 is the flow velocity and @xmath15 the pressure . at the length and velocity scales of the cell cytoskeleton",
    ", inertia is negligible .",
    "an estimate of the reynolds number using the parameter tables in the appendix and the density of water @xmath16 kg m@xmath17 gives @xmath18 ( assuming the maximum velocity scale is @xmath19 ) .    finally , if we assume that the fluids are completely immiscible , then the interface velocity will be the same as the velocity in the medium at that point , such that :    @xmath20    these simple equations model the evolution of a newtonian fluid droplet embedded in another newtonian fluid , with a varying surface tension @xmath21 at the interface .",
    "in @xcite surface tension decreases with surfactant concentration @xcite , however here we consider the case where it depends on a concentration of active matter on the interface generating contractile stresses .",
    "thus the model is similar to models of anti - surfactants on an interface that locally increase surface tension @xcite .",
    "the difference in an active system is that energy is consumed locally by the particles and converted to work , and it is assumed that the chemical fuel concentration can be treated as a constant everywhere .",
    "we consider an active liquid crystal dispersed on the interface such that the fluid particles are ordered along the tangent line of the interface .",
    "this is the 2d limit of the case of a 3d fluid droplet with an isotropically ordered liquid crystal confined to the plane of the interface ( the 3d case is discussed analytically in @xcite ) . as in the model of the actin cortex in @xcite",
    "we consider that this active fluid is contractile enough to generate a negative pressure in the ( 1d ) boundary layer for small concentrations , and that a passive pressure will become stronger at larger concentration .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with experiments on reconstituted crosslinked actomyosin _ in vitro _",
    "which , within a range of myosin and crosslinker density , initially contracts and increases in density until a steady state size is reached @xcite . in this case , we consider the lowest order contribution to be linear in @xmath22 as we are using a one - component description .",
    "these contractile forces , when confined along the tangent line of the droplet interface , give rise to a change in surface tension equivalent to the stress in the active fluid :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the bare surface tension of the fluid drop . the activity @xmath25 is a phenomenological parameter quantifying the strength of the active contractile @xmath26 or extensile @xmath27 forces with passive repulsion force proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "it will be useful to consider results with respect the effective activity @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the stationary steady state concentration .",
    "note also that there is potentially a passive pressure term linear in @xmath31 absorbed into @xmath25 , but as all of these terms are phenomenological this does not change the model .",
    "in general the order of the active term in powers of @xmath22 requires details of the microscopic interaction responsible , but for the scope of this paper we consider this linear case only . as in @xcite conservation of mass on the moving interface @xmath32 gives :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the stretching factor , relating the length of a boundary element @xmath35 to its initial length @xmath36 such that @xmath37 .",
    "eq implies that :    @xmath38    the second term in eq is the lagrangian advection term .",
    "diffusion of the mass on the closed interface is incorporated with the addition of the term @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the diffusion coefficient on the interface . including this term , the evolution of the concentration @xmath22 becomes :    @xmath41    the final term @xmath42 captures any binding to or unbinding from the boundary , which we define in eq .",
    "we explicitly consider the coupling of the interface concentration to a bulk concentration @xmath43 in the internal fluid .",
    "we only consider this concentration as active when bound to the interface , because an isotropic stress generates no flow in an incompressible medium . in the case of the cytoskeleton active",
    "fluid , our system could model a two component system of motor proteins and actin filaments , where the isotropic filament network is concentrated on the interface and remains fixed while a population of motor proteins in the droplet can bind and unbind from this network .",
    "then the equations describing an internal bulk concentration can be incorporated into this model by defining a level - set function @xmath44 such that :    @xmath45 } { \\rm d } l =   \\begin{cases } 1 \\qquad { \\rm if } \\quad { \\boldsymbol{x } } \\in \\omega_0\\\\ 0 \\qquad { \\rm if } \\quad { \\boldsymbol{x } } \\notin \\omega_0 \\end{cases } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that length element @xmath46 changes as the boundary deforms .",
    "then , following @xcite we define the concentration field of the unbound active particles as @xmath47 and hence the advection - diffusion equation describing this quantity is :    @xmath48}}{\\partialt } } + { \\nabla \\cdot}{{\\left ( { \\boldsymbol{v}}({\\boldsymbol{x}},t)h({\\boldsymbol{x}},t)\\rho({\\boldsymbol{x}},t ) \\right ) } } = d_f{\\nabla \\cdot}{{\\left ( h({\\boldsymbol{x}},t)\\nabla \\rho({\\boldsymbol{x}},t ) \\right ) } } - q({\\boldsymbol{x}},t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where :    @xmath49}\\delta({\\boldsymbol{x}}-{\\boldsymbol{x}}){\\left| { \\frac{\\partial{\\boldsymbol{x}}}{\\partials } } \\right|}{\\rm d}s \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the unbound concentration of active material at the boundary @xmath50 therefore is defined as :    @xmath51    we assume for this model that the binding rates obey a linear scaling with local concentration .",
    "however it is likely that this is not a realistic assumption given the large gradients in concentration field that the simulations predict .",
    "investigating and incorporating more realistic binding behaviour goes beyond the scope of this work and would demand a model informed by the microscopic details of the system in question .",
    "+ eq ensures that the total mass of active material is conserved such that :    @xmath52}}{\\partialt}}{\\rm d}^2{\\boldsymbol{x } } + \\int_c { \\frac{\\partialc}{\\partialt } } { \\left| { \\frac{\\partial{\\boldsymbol{x}}}{\\partials } } \\right|}{\\rm d}s   = 0 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus these equations describe advection - diffusion inside the droplet with containing boundary conditions .",
    "we independently incorporate an active fluid in the bulk of the drop . as mentioned in the previous section , an isotropic active fluid can not generate flow if it is incompressible , so we consider the case of an active liquid crystal with strong polar ordering .",
    "thus , we define a unit polarisation vector @xmath53 which describes the direction of local polar ordering .",
    "as shown in @xcite we can model the passive dynamics of this system by the frank free energy functional with appropriate boundary terms . in this context",
    "we can write this as :    @xmath54}{\\rm d}^2{\\boldsymbol{x } } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first term in eq is the one constant approximation of the frank free energy density .",
    "the second term is used to replace the lagrange multiplier which ensures @xmath55 as used in @xcite .",
    "this term is minimised when @xmath53 is a unit vector and so for large @xmath56 this is realised everywhere inside the droplet except near to any topological defects .",
    "this can be seen by writing the polarisation as @xmath57}$ ] so that in the large anchoring limit the free energy is minimised for @xmath58 everywhere , and @xmath59 must satisfy the ginzburg - landau equation @xcite :    @xmath60",
    "this ordinary differential equation ( ode ) is non - linear due to the @xmath61 term and hence we are only able to solve it numerically . assuming that @xmath62 at the droplet boundary ( strong anchoring ) and @xmath63 at the origin we find the solutions plotted in fig [ fig : rdep ] . in the limit @xmath64 this term fulfils the role of the lagrange multiplier @xmath65 and strictly enforces @xmath62 on @xmath66 and @xmath63 on @xmath67 . in the simulations",
    ", we have to use finite @xmath56 , hence there is some finite gradient of polarisation across the interface and around the defect , which sets the effective core size of the defect in the system .    .",
    "as @xmath56 increases the distribution tends towards @xmath62 everywhere.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the final term in eq is minimised for filament polarisation @xmath53 aligned with the outward normal direction near the interface .",
    "we consider this polar boundary condition as actin networks are found to order in such a way near the cell membrane in experiments @xcite .",
    "this term is the source of polar ordering in the simulations as all the other terms are symmetric for @xmath68 .",
    "+ this model now looks similar to many phase field models of ( active and passive ) liquid crystal emulsions in the literature @xcite .",
    "the key difference in the immersed boundary formulation is that the interfacial width does not depend on the surface tension and is a numerical approximation to a sharp interface , and the level - set function @xmath44 is enslaved to the position of this interface .",
    "this means we can usefully change the properties of the boundary without requiring a change to any other part of the calculation .",
    "thus , if we assume that activity is confined to the drop we can write the active stress as @xcite     @xmath69 the passive distortion stress in the liquid crystal is defined in terms of the molecular field @xmath70",
    "@xcite    @xmath71    the molecular field @xmath72 acts to minimise the free energy functional @xmath73 with respect to @xmath53 , and @xmath74 is the coupling constant between the flow gradient and polarisation .",
    "the final term is the ericksen stress , a generalisation of the hydrostatic pressure for complex fluids , which in this case is given by @xcite :    @xmath75    in addition , there is a stress term due to the polarisation across the interface given by ( as used in @xcite ) :     @xmath76 the stress then is incorporated into the force balance so that eq becomes :    @xmath77    finally the evolution of the polarisation field is governed everywhere by @xcite :    @xmath78    where the vorticity tensor @xmath79 and strain rate @xmath80 act to reorient the polar particles .",
    "in this section we look at some preliminary tests performed to check the accuracy of the simulations and results that are pertinent to the research questions posed in the introduction .",
    "namely , we quantify symmetry breaking transitions and steady state behaviour including droplet motility and deformation which resemble aspects of cytoskeletal dynamics driven by active stresses .",
    "we also look at the role of certain parameters on the phase transitions we observe and relate this to similar systems discussed in the literature .",
    "we normalise the length and time scales of the simulations with respect to the initial droplet radius @xmath81 and the viscosity @xmath13 and following some checks of accuracy choose step sizes of @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we choose a grid length of @xmath85 , which gives @xmath86 , which has prime factors of @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , resulting in efficiency savings in the fft algorithm .",
    "a full list of the parameter value ranges used in these simulations can be found in the methods section .",
    "we relate these values to si units by setting the length , time and energy scales to cytoskeleton relevant values such that @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xcite , and @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "we first test the fluid simulation code alone without any active terms to check that it agrees with the expected behaviour of a simple fluid drop in 2d .",
    "we consider a droplet with an initially deformed shape given by :    @xmath93}{\\left [ \\cos(\\theta^0_{k+1/2}),\\sin(\\theta^0_{k+1/2 } ) \\right]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath94 ( see fig [ fig : testshape ] ) .",

    "generally , we compute the first few orders of fourier coefficients @xmath100 , but in this particular test we just present @xmath96 as the shape index as this is initially set to @xmath101 by eq . the evolution of this shape index is presented in fig [ fig : testshape](b ) for several values of surface tension @xmath5 . as one would expect the droplet returns to a spherical shape , and the time it takes to do so is linearly proportional to the surface tension .",
    "reducing the grid spacing from @xmath82 to @xmath102 makes no discernible difference to the droplet evolution and nor does increasing the grid size @xmath103 .",
    "thus our choice of @xmath104 appears sufficient to render interactions with the droplet s periodic image negligible .",
    "we also note that once the droplet reaches steady state , there is still some flow in the system even though analytically the flow should be zero .",
    "this arises due to inaccuracies in the mapping to the cartesian mesh .",
    "we find that these flows are very small and do not affect the droplet shape .",
    "however , these flow are on average only an order of magnitude smaller than those produced by the random perturbation that we apply , so they could affect the symmetry breaking direction .",
    "in this section we present the steady states observed in the active isotropic interface model .",
    "first , we consider the case where the active fluid is bound to the interface , setting @xmath105 and quantify the steady states observed . following this we increase this binding rate and observe the differences this coupling can make to the observed steady state .    in all of these cases , in order to enable the droplet to break symmetry we apply a perturbation to the system at time @xmath106 .",
    "we do this by altering the concentration at the interface at the beginning of the time - step by a small amount . in order to conserve mass , we perturb the concentration using a fourier series :    @xmath107}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath108 is as defined in eqs and and the coefficients @xmath109 and @xmath110 are assigned randomly generated values between @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "we find that for all values of contractile activity tested above a threshold value , a swimming steady state is observed with the droplet remaining circular ( see fig [ fig : abbspeed ] ) as we predict analytically in @xcite .",
    "we find it necessary to use a non - zero value of @xmath113 on the interface in order to ensure numerical stability and physically reasonable results . in fig",
    "[ fig : abbspeed ] we show how the dependence of steady state droplet swimming speed against effective activity @xmath114 only depends weakly on the parameter @xmath113 .",
    "the effect on droplet speed of the parameter @xmath113 is weak because while increasing @xmath113 reduces the magnitude of the gradients in @xmath22 ( and hence @xmath5 ) along the interface , these gradients are spread over more of the droplet interface and still generate flow towards the concentration peak .     for different values of @xmath113 .",
    "inset : droplet swimming steady state , coloured interface shows concentration ( black to yellow : low to high ) and vector field shows flow field scaled for visibility .",
    "simulation parameters : @xmath115.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we also see from fig [ fig : abbspeed ] that the activity dependence of the speed is typical of active steady state phenomena @xcite initially showing a linear dependence on activity near the threshold and a weaker dependence at higher activity values .",
    "this suggests an optimum swimming speed efficiency , above which extra swimming speed begins to cost more active energy .",
    "the phase diagram in fig [ fig : abphase](a ) shows how the activity threshold depends on the diffusion of @xmath22 on the interface .",
    "this dependence is approximately linear and is well characterised by the linear stability analysis presented in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , fig [ fig : abphase](b ) shows that even though diffusion increases the active energy required to break symmetry , faster diffusion rates result in faster swimming droplets at the same activity values .",
    "further , we see that at large enough activity , we observe the formation of two peaks in the concentration profile , which quickly coalesce to form one .    .",
    "simulation parameters : @xmath116 . ]      setting the binding rates @xmath117 to be non - zero can completely alter the dynamics of the system . in the case of slow bulk diffusion or binding rate",
    "compared to the active flow timescale , we see that this coupling simply dampens the instability discussed in the previous section and reduces the final droplet speed .",
    "this is because the active concentration is recycled by the internal fluid , unbinding more at peak concentrations and diffusing slowly through the drop ( see fig [ fig : bulkvel ] ) .",
    "we fix the bulk diffusion @xmath118 and increase the binding rate @xmath119 and observe that the feedback from the internal concentration changes the observed behaviour .",
    "the flow field in the swimming drop reference is rearward near the interface and forward through the middle .",
    "this means that the active particles unbinding at the droplet rear are advected through the middle of the drop and this feedback can lead to the nucleation of a second peak in the concentration . in the simulations this results in a continuous transition with respect to @xmath114 from a steady motile state to ` wandering ' motile states ( characterised by the periodic nucleation and coalescence of a second concentration peak , snapshot shown in fig [ fig : bulkvel](b ) ) and stationary two - peak solutions ( fig [ fig : bulkvel](c ) ) .",
    "movies of these simulations can be found in the supplementary information .     over a range of contractile activity values for different binding rates @xmath120 .",
    "insets show steady state configurations with concentration on interface shown by colour density ( black to yellow ) and blue arrows show the velocity .",
    "higher binding rates reduce the droplet speed and enables the formation of two concentration peaks ( see insets ( b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "simulation parameters : @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 . ]",
    "we see that the wandering state is really a transition phase from steady motility to a stable two - peak configuration .",
    "this result is very interesting as it suggests a simple feedback mechanism such as advection - diffusion of material through the droplet is sufficient to stabilise the two - peak solution .",
    "physical intuition suggests that two peaks of this nature should always be unstable due to the hydrodynamic interaction between them .",
    "thus these stable solutions highlight a simple physical mechanism that is generic to such droplet systems .",
    "however , as outlined in @xcite , this transition is not simply a function of the effective peclt number in the drop , since faster diffusion in the drop decreases the activity required to spontaneously form multiple peaks in concentration on the interface .",
    "however , it is clear that the binding rate and advection terms need to be large to stabilise the two - peak solution .",
    "we can test that the simulations of a droplet of active polar fluid are working by comparing to the hybrid lattice boltzmann ( lb ) simulations published in @xcite . by adjusting our simulation parameters to be the same as in the hybrid lb simulations of an active polar fluid we can compare the steady states directly . as in reference @xcite we set the following parameters as : @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "we initialise both sets of simulations with a small polarisation in the positive @xmath134 direction inside the droplet , and perturb the systems by applying a small normal anchoring @xmath135 for the first 5000 time - steps .",
    "we set the surface tension to @xmath136 which is approximately the effective surface tension in the phase field model in @xcite .",
    "we also note that , the active stress in the hybrid lb simulations is proportional to @xmath137 where @xmath138 inside the droplet , and @xmath139 outside . therefore , when we compare activity values in fig [ fig : lbcomp](a ) , the activity values used in the hybrid lb simulations are multiplied by @xmath87 for consistency .",
    "we can see from fig [ fig : lbcomp ] that we have good agreement between the two sets of simulations , with similar steady state velocity trends and droplet shape over a range of contractile activity values .",
    "we see that the symmetry breaking threshold agrees well between the simulations , however the non - linear dependence of droplet speed on activity is slightly different",
    ". this may in part be due to the estimates of surface tension which have no analytical analogue in the lb simulations , as well as the only approximate incompressibility achieved by lb ( which is exact in our model ) .",

    "we observe that with this boundary condition we only see an active motile state for extensile activity @xmath141 .",
    "this is in contrast to simulations by giomi _",
    "@xcite which show that , with normal anchoring an active _ nematic _ droplet shows swimming states for contractile activity .",
    "this suggests that it is the difference between nematic and polar order that is responsible for the difference .",
    "the stationary state of the system with polar order consists of an aster with defect @xmath142 at the droplet centre , whereas in the nematic case it consists of an elongated droplet with @xmath143 defects along the long - axis of the droplet .",
    "this difference in stationary state therefore changes the geometry such that the stability threshold for motion changes sign .",
    "this change appears to be robust for the values of @xmath74 we have tested ( @xmath144 corresponding to ` rod - like ' and one to ` disc - like ' flow aligning particles @xcite ) .    as predicted in @xcite the activity threshold for the onset of motion does not depend on the surface tension , however the droplet steady state speed",
    "as we can see in fig [ fig : shapevel ] the motile steady state is elongated and the shape deformation depends on the surface tension . in fig",
    "[ fig : shapevel ] we plot the @xmath145 mode shape parameter @xmath146 from eqs and ( essentially measuring droplet elongation ) and final droplet velocity against the surface tension . clearly , due to the strong anchoring at the interface , the polarisation profile is coupled to the boundary shape , so when the surface tension is small the polarisation profile is able to deform the droplet more and reach a faster steady state .",
    "as surface tension is increased the deformation reduces and goes towards a circular droplet , and in this limit the droplet velocity begins to plateau at its minimum value .",
    "this shows a positive feedback between the shape and the motion in these droplets , but in this case it does not affect the symmetry breaking threshold .",

    "@xmath5 we see that the opposite sides of the immersed boundary are almost brought into contact . however , these simulations do not yet have the capability of modelling division of the droplet as this is not a part of the ib model , which is a shortcoming in comparison to phase field models .",
    "thus in these cases the simulation method breaks down . in most cases we test",
    "the deformation does stop and we observe further symmetry breaking of the internal polarisation field such that the droplet front enlarges and the droplet swims with the 3-defect configuration .",
    "however we do not characterise these dynamics here as they are complex and depend strongly on the value and sign of the liquid crystal coupling parameter @xmath74 .     and surface tension @xmath153 at 3 different times in the simulation ( corresponding to @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 respectively in simulation units ) using the same format as the inset in fig [ fig : shapevel ] .",
    "all other parameters are the same used to obtain fig [ fig : shapevel ] . ]    in principle one could impose conditions that would allow division of the boundary , such that there were two separate immersed boundaries in the simulation . to do this , one would need to calculate the separation between non - neighbouring boundary points @xmath157 and @xmath158 , and once they were within a certain distance ( say @xmath36 ) separate the boundary into 2 boundaries one from @xmath159 the other from @xmath160 .",
    "it is well known that active systems can display turbulent like behaviour at zero reynolds number when the the equilibrium relaxation time is long compared to the timescale of the active dynamics . in terms of activity , the threshold for this behaviour is proportional to @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the one frank elastic constant and @xmath163 is the system size @xcite .",
    "these turbulent - like states have been observed experimentally in bacterial suspensions and reconstituted cytoskeletal networks @xcite where the active flows can spontaneously create and annihilate polarisation defects in pairs and generate vortices in the flow .",
    "we observe the onset of such dynamics in an active polar fluid droplet by reducing the elastic constant in our simulations to @xmath164 .",
    "we find that due to the strong anchoring condition at the interface , and relatively high surface tension the polarisation field remains approximately fixed at the boundary .",
    "however , reducing the constant @xmath162 reduces the equilibrium interaction between these filaments and those near the droplet centre which show dynamics that are only weakly coupled to the interface .",
    "this transition to turbulent motion is easily observed if we consider the case of contractile activity which for low activity values stabilises the defect at the droplet centre .",
    "snapshots of the dynamics are displayed in fig [ fig : turbulence ] .",
    "we see that due to the low @xmath162 value the stationary configuration becomes unstable but the flows are not large enough to significantly deform the drop .",
    "the result is unsteady dynamics of the polarisation field in the centre of the drop that are mostly decoupled from the interface dynamics .",
    "this results in stretching and distortion of the original @xmath165 defect into a line and then further pairwise creation of @xmath166 defects ( shown in fig [ fig : turbulence ] by the points where four black stripes intersect ) .",
    "as we scale the droplet size up , or decrease @xmath162 , one would expect that these turbulent dynamics would become faster as the effective energy cost of deformation becomes smaller relative to the activity .",
    "note that due to the polar nature of the system modelled here , only defects of integer topological charge can be generated , so these have fundamentally different dynamics to the half integer defects observed in active nematics .    , surface tension @xmath167 and @xmath164 at 4 different times in the simulation ( corresponding to @xmath16825 , 75 , 125 and 250 respectively in simulation units ) .",
    "the shading represents the schlieren texture as used in fig [ fig : deformed ] .",
    "the blue arrows show the flow field in the fluid ( averaged over neighbouring points for clarity ) , while the blue line shows the droplet interface .",
    "we also use a finer mesh than that used to obtain fig [ fig : deformed ] , with @xmath169 and @xmath170 in order to resolve the defect dynamics more clearly . ]",
    "this method can be extended to a full 3d simulation , but the steps required to do so go beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the equations related to the fixed fluid grid , such as the fluid flow equations and polarisation dynamics equations remain unchanged in 3d and the same combination of fast fourier transform and runge - kutta methods ( see methods ) can be utilised to solve for the dynamics of these quantities",
    ". however , the fluid - fluid interface is a 2d surface in the generic 3d case , and so this requires a different representation from the 1d lagrangian mesh used here .",
    "a direct extension would be to represent the fluid interface as a 2d triangular mesh .",
    "then the boundary points will evolve in exactly the same way as before .",
    "however , rather than removing single points from the interface ( as outlined in methods ) one would have to remove individual triangles below a threshold area and replace the mass contained within that triangular area .",
    "similarly , triangles with excessive eccentricity or area should be split along their short axis into two triangles to ensure stability . in general one could use any standard re - meshing algorithm ensuring that the concentration on the interface is numerically conserved and the spatial distribution is unchanged .",
    "such a mesh has been used to model surfactant coated drops in @xcite .",
    "an alternative method is to only model the immersed boundary points implicitly via the cartesian fluid mesh ( known as the immersed interface method @xcite ) .",
    "then one has to explicitly consider the stress jump in the normal direction at the interface in order to impose the boundary force @xcite .",
    "this normal force is then imparted on the cartesian mesh within the interfacial region ( defined by the numerical delta function range ) .",
    "similarly , the boundary region and associated level - set function are advected due to flow normal to the interfacial region .",
    "thus the approach is closely related except that the boundary mesh is implicitly defined rather than an explicit lagrangian mesh .",
    "we expect that the dynamics reported in this paper will be representative of what would be seen in 3d . in @xcite",
    "a linear stability analysis of these two systems predicts the same qualitative symmetry breaking behaviour despite the flow being quantitatively changed by the geometry . the main qualitative difference one would expect to observe is a deformation of the droplets with an active interface in 3-dimensions , and an investigation of how this deformation couples to concentration",
    "dynamics would be an interesting investigation for future work .",
    "in this paper we have detailed the numerical method that we have used to simulate the evolution of active droplets in 2d .",
    "we have used an immersed boundary ( ib ) method to model the fluid boundary as a lagrangian mesh of points .",
    "this allows us to explicitly simulate a concentration of isotropic active contractile particles on the interface that alter the surface tension .",
    "further , we use the immersed boundary to define a level - set function which defines the inside and outside of the drop . using this",
    "we can define an active polar liquid crystal phase in the droplet interior with anchoring at the droplet interface .",
    "our results reveal steady state migrating states in both types of active droplet . in all cases",
    "we investigate the steady state droplet velocity , which scales non - linearly with activity , levelling off at larger activity values .",
    "this means there is a generic reduction in swimming efficiency as activity is increased in these systems as observed for the flow rate in other active droplet and bulk systems @xcite .",
    "the first system we consider    is a contractile isotropic active fluid on the droplet interface and observe that without any binding and unbinding the only observed active dynamic steady state is a swimming droplet with one peak in concentration .",
    "we see that for small binding rates the steady state remains unchanged but reduces the droplet velocity . at higher binding rates feedback from the fluid flow stabilises a second concentration peak and",
    "the droplet can reach a stationary two - peak configuration for large enough activity .",
    "this shows how a simple feedback mechanism can stabilise more complex behaviour , since at low binding rates if two peaks are formed in the concentration they always attract and coalesce to form a single peak at the droplet rear .",
    "these higher order states show that this active interface shares much of its internal dynamics with models of thin layers of active fluids @xcite , and so provides a useful insight into how such a system evolves immersed in an external fluid .",
    "thus , it is a useful step in modelling the dynamics of the actin cortex in cells which many active thin film models are based on .",
    "secondly , we simulate an active polar fluid droplet with strong anchoring at the interface .",
    "we see that if when we take the frank elastic constant to be significant ( or equivalently a small droplet ) we see transitions to highly ordered dynamic states , including motion , rotation and symmetric deformation . due to the geometry of the droplets and the polar anchoring condition",
    ", we find strikingly different behaviour for the contractile and extensile regimes , with extensile activity promoting translational symmetry breaking and contractile promoting symmetric modes of deformation .",
    "using a smaller frank constant ( equivalent to a larger droplet ) we observe the onset of turbulent dynamics , discussed in depth for active nematics in @xcite . due to the confinement inside the droplet",
    "the dynamics are still constrained and we see that the number of defects in the polarisation field rarely exceeds 3 for the range of activities simulated here",
    ". however , the dynamics are unsteady due to the slow relaxation of the molecular field compared to the active flow timescale .     the results discussed here are consistent with previous studies of other active fluid droplet systems @xcite . additionally , given the increase in experimental progress in producing stable active gels and fluids in vitro @xcite , and confining such systems to droplets and vesicles @xcite it is possible that these simplified models can be tested experimentally .",
    "in particular the active fluid interface model may be achievable by coating a fluid droplet or the inside of a vesicle with a stable isotropic crosslinked actin layer .",
    "active contraction of the layer could be introduced by trapping myosin motor complexes inside the droplet / vesicle using existing microfluidic techniques .",
    "such motor complexes may have different binding kinetics than the linear case assumed here , however one would expect to observe qualitatively similar behaviour",
    ".    a useful extension of these simulations that is beyond the scope of the work we present here would be to simulate these systems in 3 dimensions . from our analysis in @xcite",
    "we would expect much of the observed dynamics to remain qualitatively the same in 3d , with the exception that we would expect deformation of the droplets under surface tension gradients .",
    "in particular it would be interesting to simulate the droplet deformation when we predict steady two peak solutions in the concentration of an active isotropic fluid on the droplet interface ( see fig [ fig : bulkvel ] ) which could equally manifest as a ring or two poles of higher concentration in this geometry .",
    "the simulations presented here can also be used to model interactions with external boundaries or elastic solids in a self - consistent way through the ib method .",
    "similarly , one could investigate the dynamics of multiple active droplets simply by adding more lagrangian boundary meshes .",
    "these boundaries interact via their coupling to the fluid flow , and hence one would be able to simulate confinement of these droplets without necessarily sacrificing the periodic solution method outlined in the methods section .    a preliminary investigation into such external boundaries is discussed in @xcite .    finally , the modular nature of the code means that these simulations are capable of simulating a coupled active interface and an internal active polar fluid .",
    "the dynamics of such a system will be even more complex and so the results presented here will be relevant to understanding those systems in future . similarly , this will be relevant also to systems of passive liquid crystal drops propelled by active surfactants as studied in @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the results we present here demonstrate complex dynamics in confined active fluids with minimal degrees of freedom .",
    "these simple one - component models demonstrate steady state dynamics akin to those observed in cells , cell fragments and reconstituted cell components that are driven by the active cell cytoskeleton .",

    "thus , we also add a condition for the removal of a boundary point if @xmath321 where , after some testing of different boundary shapes , we arrived at @xmath322 , where we have defined @xmath323 to be the distance of the boundary point from the droplet centre of mass .",
    "therefore any excessive second order gradients in the boundary position are effectively smoothed out .",
    "however , we choose the limit so that smooth boundary deformations are still permitted , such as those observed in our results for an active polar fluid drop .",
    "+      we observe that the droplets can lose significant area over the whole simulation time , despite the fluid incompressibility .",
    "this effect is observed in the fluid immersed boundary simulations presented in @xcite and @xcite but is very slight and gradual ( on the order of @xmath324 area loss over a whole simulation ) as the size of the flows is imposed externally .",
    "it is possible to observe much more rapid area loss in our simulations due to the continual addition and removal of interface points , and so to prevent this , and be consistent with the incompressibility condition , we calculate the area at each time step as    @xmath325    we subtract this from the initial droplet area at time @xmath326 to get @xmath327 . in order to keep the shape fixed ,",
    "we then alter the values of @xmath328 with a constant in the normal direction : @xmath329 .",
    "we then iterate this process , recalculating the area after this alteration and updating the value of @xmath330 accordingly until the area is conserved within a certain tolerance .",
    "we choose this tolerance to be @xmath331 and find that this step rarely takes more than 2 iterations , and in an individual step @xmath330 is at most the order of @xmath332 , which is several orders of magnitude below the average velocity of the points in these simulations .",
    "thus this area conservation step makes little difference to the evolution of the droplet .",
    "the final simulation code is modular in nature , so that we can turn features on or off .",
    "the bare code contains the simulation of a passive fluid drop in a periodic domain , then one can choose whether to add an active boundary and an active polar fluid separately .",
    "on initialisation we define the fluid boundary points @xmath328 , the concentration on the boundary @xmath333 ( if included ) and the filament polarisation @xmath294 ( if included ) .",
    "the order of execution of the algorithm is given below :    1 .",
    "boundary forces calculated according to eq .",
    "bulk forces calculated as outlined in eqs - ( if active polar fluid is included ) .",
    "3 .   solve the stokes equation following eqs to .",
    "calculate boundary velocity using eqs and .",

    "update concentration at the interface by solving the system in eq",
    "update the bulk concentration @xmath43 using the crank - nicholson scheme of eq",
    "add or remove fluid boundary points as outlined by fig [ fig : addrem ] .",
    "in step 5 we apply a coupled fourth order runge - kutta method where we update the boundary and the polarisation field . at the start of the update we store @xmath334 and @xmath335 , then update them for a half time - step such that @xmath336 and @xmath337 where @xmath338 is the vector given by the right hand sides of eqs and .",
    "we then repeat steps 1 - 4 for this new polarisation and boundary position . repeating this process we can define :    @xmath339    where @xmath340 and @xmath341 are again the right hand sides of eqs and evaluated at the @xmath342 and @xmath343 time - steps respectively .",
    "we also define @xmath344 similarly as this vector evaluated for the @xmath345 values of the polarisation and boundary condition . in between each fractional",
    "update we repeat steps 1 - 4 . then finally the updated polarisation and boundary are given by :    @xmath346    we run the simulation , iterating over steps 1 - 9 usually @xmath347 times , unless we deem that longer is required . a full list of the parameter value ranges is given below :    .fluid simulation parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
