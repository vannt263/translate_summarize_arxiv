    "this would also immediately lead to corollary [ corr:1 ] below if we defined the subsequent concept of weighted integer compositions by the formal power series expansion @xmath2 , with notation as explicated below . ]",

    "such identities may be important for the efficient evaluation of the partial bell polynomials , as hinted at in cvijovi @xcite , who also indicates applications of the polynomials .",
    "importantly , they generalize the stirling numbers @xmath7 of the second kind , since @xmath8 .",
    "the purpose of the present note is to show that these identities are special cases of identities for _ weighted integer compositions _ and to outline very short proofs for the more general identities , based on sums of discrete random variables .",
    "our main point is to compile ( identical or very similar ) results developed within heterogeneous communities of research , and to combine these results .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : add ] , we present three additional identities for the partial bell polynomials . throughout , we write @xmath9 as a shorthand for @xmath10 , unless explicit reference to the indeterminates is critical .",
    "an integer composition of a nonnegative integer @xmath11 is a @xmath12-tuple @xmath13 , for @xmath14 , of nonnegative integers such that @xmath15 .",
    "we call @xmath12 the _ number of parts_. note that order of part matters , and this distinguishes integer compositions from _ integer partitions_. now , to generalize , we may consider @xmath16-_colored _ integer compositions , where each possible _ part size _",
    "@xmath17 may come in @xmath18 different colors , whereby @xmath19 .",
    "for example , the integer @xmath20 has nine distinct @xmath16-colored integer compositions , for @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , with @xmath24 parts , namely , @xmath25 where we use a star superscript to distinguish the two different colors of part size @xmath26 . for _ weighted integer compositions _ we let , more generally , @xmath18 be an arbitrary real number ( or even a value in a commutative ring ) , the weight of part size @xmath27 .",
    "colored integer compositions have been discussed in @xcite , and weighted integer compositions have been under review in eger @xcite , but have been investigated as early as hoggatt and lind s @xcite work .",
    "let @xmath28 denote the _ number _ of @xmath16-weighted integer compositions of @xmath11 with @xmath12 parts , when the range of @xmath16 is @xmath29 , and let @xmath28 denote the _ total weight _ of all @xmath16-weighted integer compositions of @xmath11 with @xmath12 parts , when the range of @xmath16 is the set of reals @xmath30 .",

    "the proof of theorem [ th:1 ] is simple .",
    "identity is a direct application of the definition of @xmath28 and follows , combinatorially , from by rewriting the summation over integer compositions into a summation over integer partitions and then adjusting each term in the sum appropriately ( in particular , the multinomial coefficients account for distributing the parts in partitions ) . alternatively ,",
    "when @xmath28 is defined as coefficient of a certain polynomial , then can also be arrived at via application of the multinomial theorem ( see @xcite ) or the formula of fa di bruno @xcite for the higher order derivatives of composite functions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "interpreting @xmath18 , for @xmath39 , as indeterminates , theorem [ th:1 ] identity immediately implies that @xmath16-weighted integer compositions ` generalize ' partial bell polynomials .    [ corr:1 ] let @xmath31 be integers .",
    "then : @xmath40 whereby @xmath41    corollary [ corr:1 ] has been established in @xcite in the more particular setting of restricted integer compositions , or , classical ` multinomial / extended binomial coefficients ' , where , in our notation , @xmath42 for all @xmath43 , for some positive integer @xmath44 .",
    "this yielded the conclusion that partial bell polynomials ` generalize ' restricted integer compositions insofar as @xmath45 , where @xmath16 is the indicator function on @xmath46 .",
