    "in his monograph @xcite stein suggested the study of analogues of the fundamental operators in the classical harmonic analysis , such as riesz transforms , conjugate poisson integrals , multipliers , fractional integrals , maximal functions , square functions , in a context of discrete or continuous expansions with respect to eigenfunctions of self - adjoint and positive differential operators . during the last years , this program , or some of its aspects , has been successfully developed by many authors in various settings .",
    "the study in the framework of bessel ( and also ultraspherical ) operators was initiated even before @xcite by the seminal paper @xcite of muckenhoupt and stein .",
    "they introduced the notion of conjugation in the bessel setting , and their starting point was the formulation of suitable cauchy - riemann type equations leading to a definition of conjugate poisson integrals .",
    "then the riesz transform , or rather the conjugate function mapping according to the terminology used in @xcite , emerge as the corresponding boundary value .",
    "after @xcite the bessel context was investigated by several authors .",
    "in particular , recently betancor and stempak @xcite and betancor , buraczewski , faria , martnez and torrea @xcite obtained some boundedness results for a riesz transform and @xmath1-functions in bessel settings .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to advance the study of @xmath0 mapping properties of several basic operators related to the harmonic analysis of bessel operators .",
    "we analyze the behavior of the maximal operators for the heat and poisson integrals , riesz transform and a @xmath1-function ( see section [ sec : prel ] for rigorous definitions of these objects ) associated with the bessel operator appearing in @xcite , @xmath2 which is essentially self - adjoint in @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 our main interest is focused on characterizing the power weights @xmath6 , for which the abovementioned operators are of strong type , weak type or restricted weak type @xmath7 with respect to the measure @xmath8 .",
    "we shall give a complete description of such power weights , and in all cases prove the outcomes to be sharp .",
    "our results are achieved by the nowadays standard method of splitting the integral kernels into local and global parts , where _ local _ is related to a symmetric cone containing the diagonal of @xmath9 .",
    "following muckenhoupt and stein @xcite , we show that in the local region the operators behave like those derived from the usual laplacian , while in the global region they are essentially controlled by hardy - type operators . in order to get sharp results for the range of the power weights ,",
    "it is necessary to obtain a precise knowledge of the behavior of the kernels involved .",
    "we use several tools in performing this task , one of them being the local caldern - zygmund theory established in @xcite .",
    "we point out that in the literature there are some recent related results regarding the harmonic analysis derived from the bessel operator @xmath10 which is essentially self - adjoint in @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , in @xcite riesz transforms and @xmath1-functions were studied in this setting .",
    "the results contained in the present paper have counterparts in the framework of @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , for proving those twin results there is no need to carry out parallel computations since we may directly take advantage of the estimates and properties already shown in the @xmath13 context .",
    "comments sketching how the corresponding results in the @xmath12 setting can be concluded will be given along the paper .    finally , let us give a short account of the previous results concerning the operators we investigate . for the poisson and heat - diffusion integrals , the unweighted case , with the restriction @xmath14 , was studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "a @xmath1-function based on the poisson kernel was investigated in @xcite , where strong type @xmath7 for @xmath15 , with respect to the measure @xmath16 , @xmath14 , was obtained .",
    "considering the riesz transform , in @xcite a characterization of the weights for strong type @xmath7 , @xmath17 , and weak type @xmath18 was given .",
    "the approach to this operator was analogous to that in @xcite , through conjugate poisson integrals .",
    "here we adopt the point of view taken in @xcite , and show that for any @xmath19 the riesz transform is a principal value integral with a kernel that satisfies similar estimates to those in @xcite .",
    "although the scope of @xcite for the strong and weak type inequalities is more general than ours , we also analyze restricted weak type obtaining new weighted inequalities .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : prel ] we introduce the main objects of our study and state the main results , theorems [ tmax]-[tg1 ]",
    "there we also gather some general facts and lemmas that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "the remaining sections [ sec : heat]-[sec : subord ] are separately devoted to the heat integral maximal operator , riesz transform , @xmath1-function and poisson integral maximal operator , respectively , and the proofs of the main theorems . in section [ sec : subord ] we also take into account a square function related to the poisson integral .",
    "recall that the standard set of eigenfuctions of the bessel operator @xmath20 consists of @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the bessel function of the first kind and order @xmath23 . indeed , a straightforward computation ( cf .",

    "it is known that for each @xmath62 , @xmath63 , the above limit exists for almost every @xmath64 .    nevertheless , our approach to the riesz transform is more direct , and the definition is based on a singular integral representation . by the results of @xcite ,",

    "in the present paper , in contrast with @xcite , we consider the riesz transform @xmath66 for the full range @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , to define strictly the operator @xmath69 we use the heat integral rather than the poisson one , @xmath71 it will be shown in section [ sec : riesz ] that the limit @xmath72 exists for each @xmath73 and @xmath74 is well defined for @xmath64 , provided that @xmath75 .",
