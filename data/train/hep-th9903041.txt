    "for about a year now , there has been a revival of interest in supergravity vacua of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an anti  de sitter space and @xmath6 a compact einstein manifold .",
    "this revival started after maldacena s conjecture @xcite of duality between kaluza ",
    "klein supergravity theories in the bulk of anti  de sitter space and conformal field theories on the boundary , @xmath7 since the proposal by gubser , klebanov , polyakov and witten for this duality @xcite , some work is being done with the scope of testing this conjecture of holography .",
    "this has brought the whole research area of branes and ads representations from the eighties back alive .    of particular interest in testing this ads / cft duality",
    "is the singleton problem .",
    "representations of ads algebras have been studied extensively in the past @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by a lowest energy and the total angular momentum .",
    "most of them have a poincar analogue , except for some ultra  short representations which are referred to as singleton representations .",
    "the most considerable property of these singletons is that they can not be formulated as a field theory on the bulk of the ads space . yet , singleton actions exist , but can only be formulated if the singleton fields are restricted to live on the boundary of @xmath5 .",
    "it has also been known for a long time how to get these singleton actions and what they describe : namely , they describe the small fluctuations of a brane at _ the end of the universe _ @xcite .",
    "all this has been known for about ten years .",
    "still , the singleton has not been constructed explicitly from the brane until recently .",
    "it is clear that an explicit realization of this singleton at the end of the universe is an important ingredient for testing the ads / cft conjecture .",
    "thus , to find the singleton from the super membrane one has to do the following :    1 .",
    "consider the super membrane action that is invariant with respect to @xmath8 supersymmetry .",
    "2 .   expand this action around a classical solution .",
    "3 .   send it to infinity .",
    "as far as the first step is concerned , membrane actions in an explicit background of @xmath9 have been constructed by our collaboration @xcite and others @xcite . here , we will overview the construction of the membrane action and the derivation the singleton action in this background , as it was done in @xcite .",
    "however , before carrying out this programme let us point out that the singleton theory that is retrieved on this space is quite trivial and does nt yield a proper test for the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "therefore one has to consider the singleton problem on other non  trivial backgrounds .",
    "suitable backgrounds for this are given if one replaces the sphere by other coset manifolds @xmath10 .",
    "a complete classification of these backgrounds for @xmath11 is already know and these spaces have been thoroughly studied in the eighties @xcite .",
    "they are in one  to ",
    "one correspondence with the @xmath10 freund  rubin compactifications .",
    "also , the number of preserved supersymmetries @xmath12 are known .",
    "of all these coset spaces , the case of the round and squashed seven spheres are the best known ( corresponding to @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 near horizon supergravities ) but in the eighties the kaluza ",
    "klein spectra have been systematically derived also for all the other solutions using the technique of harmonic expansions @xcite .",
    "the organization of these spectra in supermultiplets is known not only for the round @xmath15 @xcite but also for the case of supersymmetric @xmath16 spaces @xmath17 where @xmath18 define the embedding of the @xmath19 factor of @xmath20 in @xmath21 .",
    "for @xmath22 we have @xmath23 , in all the other ( non supersymmetric ) cases we have @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath23 multiplet structure was obtained in @xcite . at present a group in torino @xcite",
    "is doing the harmonic analysis on the so  called stiefel and @xmath25 manifolds as well .",
    "since much is known and will be known about these spaces , they constitute an excellent laboratory to make direct checks of the holographic correspondence .",
    "let s now clarify the qualitative difference between the seven sphere and the other @xmath10 spaces . for a @xmath10 space that admits @xmath12 supersymmetries ,",
    "the isometry group is factorized as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the @xmath28symmetry of the orthosymplectic algebra @xmath29 , while the factor @xmath30 is the gauge  group of the vector multiplets .",
    "correspondingly the three  dimensional world  volume action of the @xmath31 must have the following superconformal symmetry : @xmath32 where @xmath30 is a _",
    "flavor group_. in the maximal case the harmonics on @xmath15 are labeled only by @xmath28symmetry representations while in the lower susy case they depend both on @xmath28 labels and on representations of the gauge / flavour group @xmath30 .",
    "the structure of @xmath33 supermultiplets determines completely their @xmath28symmetry representation content so that the harmonic analysis becomes superfluous in this case .",
    "the eigenvalues of the internal laplacians which determine _ the kaluza  klein masses _ of the @xmath33 graviton multiplets or , in the conformal reinterpretation of the theory ,",
    "the _ conformal weights _ of the corresponding primary operators , are already fixed by supersymmetry and need not be calculated . in this sense",
    "the correspondence ( [ holography ] ) is somewhat trivial in the maximal susy case : once the superconformal algebra has been identified with the super - isometry group @xmath33 the correspondence between conformal weights and kaluza ",
    "klein masses is simply guaranteed by representation theory of the superalgebra . on the other hand in the lower susy case the structure of the @xmath34",
    "supermultiplets fixes only their content in @xmath35 representations while the kaluza  klein masses , calculated through harmonic analysis depend also on @xmath30 labels . in this case",
    "the holographic correspondence yields a definite prediction on the conformal weights that , as far as superconformal symmetry is concerned would be arbitrary .",
    "explicit verification of these predictions would provide a much more stringent proof of the holographic correspondence and yield a deeper insight in its inner working . however in order to set up such a direct verification one has to solve a problem that was left open in kaluza ",
    "klein supergravity : the singleton problem .    in the remainder of this text",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the membrane on the seven sphere .",
    "the case of the cosets with lower supersymmetry is currently under investigation .    to avoid any confusion",
    ", we would like to stress here that we call singleton field theory the flat space limit of the free field theory of @xcite .",
    "we point out that , since we are going to find a theory living on a three  dimensional minkowski space rather than on @xmath36 , we have no scalar mass term which was instead required in @xcite for conformal invariance .",
    "we will see that it can also be derived as the theory living on the solitonic m2 brane .",
    "we consider the space @xmath37 , with given metric , @xmath38 with coordinates , @xmath390,\\infty [ \\cr t , w , x \\ , \\in \\ ] \\!-\\!\\infty , \\infty [ } \\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath40 is the metric of the seven sphere .",
    "this is the near horizon geometry of the @xmath1 brane @xcite .",
    "moreover in @xcite it was shown that this is a stable quantum vacuum of of the @xmath41 supergravity .",
    "the @xmath5 superspace is defined as the following coset @xmath42 and it is spanned by the four coordinates of the @xmath43 manifold and by eight majorana spinors ( i.e. they have 32 real components ) parametrizing the fermionic generators of the superalgebra .    this space can be described by means of a super solvable lie algebra parametrization . to see what this solvable lie algebra parametrization is ,",
    "let s have a look at the familiar `` union jack '' root diagram of @xmath44 , which is the complexification of @xmath45 shown in figure 1 .",
    "the fermionic supercharges form a square weight diagram within this figure , and the supertranslation algebra is then simply that the anticommutator of two fermions is given by vector addition of the corresponding weights in the diagram .",
    "the diagram can in fact be seen as a projection of the full @xmath0 root diagram , since the @xmath46 roots lie on a perpendicular hyperplane , and so on this diagram they would be at the centre .",
    "= 2.0 in    it is now easy to see that the generators in the box @xmath47 , form a super solvable lie algebra with non  zero ( anti ) commutation relations , @xmath48\\sim s\\ , , \\qquad [ d,\\sigma ] \\sim \\sigma\\ , , \\label{solvecomm}\\ ] ] since its second derivative is zero .",
    "the coset representative is now obtained by exponentiating the product of these generators with the coordinates of the coset space .",
    "we choose to write the coset representative as @xmath49 with @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the bosonic and fermionic coordinates . from the left invariant form ,",
    "@xmath52 one derives the vielbeins and @xmath53 ] , @xmath54 and @xmath55 notice that , due to the ( anti ) commutation relations ( [ solvecomm ] ) of the solvable lie algebra parametrization , the exponentiation ( [ exponentiation ] ) only contains a finite number of terms . hence , it immediately follows that the vielbeins are at most quadratic in their anti  commuting coordinates . for a discussion on this see @xcite .",
    "another convenient feature of the solvable lie algebra parametrization is that one projects out half of the spinors .",
    "this is equivalent to the projection of the @xmath8symmetry operator and thus at this stage the @xmath8 symmetry has already been fixed .",
    "this parametrization of the manifold gives rise to the metric ( [ solvmet ] ) .    to complete the parametrization of the target",
    "superspace one still has to define the vielbeins of the seven sphere .",
    "to do so , we call @xmath56 the seven coordinates of the sphere and write in stereographic projection coordinates : @xmath57    beside the @xmath8 symmetry we also fix the three  dimensional world ",
    "volume diffeomorphisms imposing the static gauge choice . to obtain static solutions we have to identify @xmath58 where @xmath59 , is the curved index of the brane .    for the action of the membrane we get :",
    "@xmath60 with , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the seven  dimensional gamma matrices @xmath63 are the generators of the @xmath64 clifford algebra and @xmath65 are the eight real killing spinors on the seven sphere . for details on the conventions see @xcite . ] @xmath66 the expression for @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 .",
    "\\label{orfan35}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the isometries of ( [ coset ] ) can be calculated explicitly in this parametrization .",
    "as was noted in @xcite , they realize conformal symmetry on the brane .",
    "for example , for the dilatation one finds , @xmath69",
    "in order to retrieve the @xmath0 singleton action we now have to do the following . first we consider a classical solution of the action ( [ confaction ] ) , @xmath70 then expand the transverse coordinates to the brane around the values for this classical solution .",
    "for this we use normal coordinates .",
    "thus we write @xmath71 where @xmath72 represent the fluctuations and @xmath73 is the membrane tension .",
    "thus the action ( [ confaction ] ) gets the following expansion as a power series in @xmath74 : @xmath75 with @xmath76 and we are to recover the singleton action from the order 1 term @xmath77 the final step is to send the brane to the boundary of ads .",
    "the boundary of ads lies at @xmath78 which is a conformally compactified minkowski space ( see one of the appendices in @xcite ) .",
    "it is already clear from the form of the action ( [ orfan47 ] ) that in order to take one of these limits one has to rescale the fields @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "in fact , a proper analysis of the supersymmetry variation , which we do not present here but can be found in @xcite , shows us that these rescalings have to be done according to @xmath81 using the notation @xmath82 the action ( [ orfan47 ] ) becomes @xmath83 clearly , this action has the right form to become the singleton action . yet , for generic values of @xmath84 it does not . to see this ,",
    "let s look at the dilatation symmetry of the action ( [ confaction ] ) .",
    "the transformation ( [ deltarho ] ) can only become a symmetry of the action ( [ confaction ] ) if we place the brane at the boundary .",
    "so we conclude that the singleton is found after putting the brane at the boundary of the anti  de sitter space and that the singleton field theory describes the centre of mass degrees of freedom of the @xmath1 brane .",
