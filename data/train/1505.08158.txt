    "despite of the fact that some chemically peculiar ( cp ) stars have `` stable '' atmospheres , they sometimes also show variability of their spectra with the period of stellar rotation due to the horizontal inhomogeneous distribution of elements abundance in their stellar atmosphere @xcite .",

    "<S> we present results for the estimation of gravity , effective temperature and radial velocity of poorly studied chemically peculiar stars recently observed with the spectropolarimeter espadons at cfht in the frame of the veselka ( vertical stratification of element abundances ) project . for four of the stars from our sample ( , , and ) , the values of their effective temperature and surface gravity are determined for the very first time . </S>",
    "<S> grids of stellar atmosphere models with the corresponding fluxes have been calculated using version 15 of the phoenix code for effective temperatures in the range of 5000k to 15000k , for the logarithm of surface gravities in the range of 3.0 to 4.5 and for the metallicities from -1.0 to + 1.5 . </S>",
    "<S> we have used these fluxes to fit the balmer line profiles employing the code fitsb2 that produces estimates of the effective temperature , gravity and radial velocity for each star . when possible , our results are compared to those previously published . </S>",
    "<S> the physical characteristics of 16 program stars are discussed with the future aim to study the abundance anomalies of chemical species and the possible vertical abundance stratification in their stellar atmosphere . </S>"
