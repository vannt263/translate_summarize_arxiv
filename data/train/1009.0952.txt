    "this range covers the analysis result of data from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) that gives 2.60@xmath3@xmath2 @xcite or 2.75@xmath4@xmath2 @xcite , depending on the different light - element nuclear reaction rate ( also 2.57@xmath50.15 from the wmap 5 data ; * ? ? ?",

    "observations reveal that the present - day d / h abundance ( d / h)@xmath8 for interstellar matter ( ism ) in the galactic disk is surprisingly as high as @xmath9 2.31@xmath5 0.24@xmath2 after correcting for dust depletion @xcite .",
    "some authors claim there are residual effects due to dust depletion which can account for the large scatter in the observed d / h @xcite . but the high d / h abundance of 2.2@xmath10@xmath2 in the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) of the lower galactic halo , which originates in the disk and is elevated into the halo @xcite , strongly supports the claim by @xcite .    the difference between ( d / h)@xmath0 and ( d / h)@xmath8 is defined as a deuterium astration factor @xmath11=(d / h)@xmath0/(d / h)@xmath8 .",
    "the value of @xmath11 should exceed unity because it is believed that all d is produced during big bang nucleosynthesis , and any subsequent destruction process of d occurs in the interior of stars .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath11 is determined by the fraction of matter which has never been cycled through stars in the present ism .",
    "accordingly , @xmath11 is closely related to the degree of heavy - element enrichment through star formation .",
    "our expectation is that the d abundance in the ism is anti - correlated with the metallicity such that the well - enriched ( @xmath1solar metallicity ) local disk demands a high @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , conventional galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) models have been applied to the evolution of d so far by several authors @xcite , and predict @xmath12 for the local disk @xcite . in other words , the local abundances of heavy elements such as fe or @xmath6-elements in the ism as well as long - lived stars imply @xmath13 at the least , that is equivalent to ( d / h)@xmath142.0@xmath15 . on the other hand , the high ( d / h)@xmath8 suggested by the recent observations implies a smaller @xmath11 . for the values of ( d / h)@xmath0=2.75@xmath2 and ( d / h)@xmath8=2.31@xmath2",

    "the d / h abundances which bridge between the primordial ( d / h)@xmath0 and the present - day ( d / h)@xmath8 provide crucial information on the evolution of d. the d / h abundance in the protosolar cloud provides crucial information at a look - back time of @xmath1 4.6 gyr .",
    "the d / h abundances deduced from the jovian atmosphere @xcite and from the solar wind @xcite are estimated to be @xmath16 0.4 ( 0.5)@xmath2 .",
    "this result is broadly consistent with the present - day local value .",
    "if these values are representative of the local disk , we are led to believe that d astration involved with star formation has turned off for the last several gyr .",
    "in fact , as the process to change the amount of d in the ism , the galactic disk involves an enrichment process through an infall of low - metallicity gas from the halo , which brings ( nearly ) primordial d , besides its destruction through star formation .",
    "this infall is required by the gce models to reproduce the abundance distribution function ( adf ) of local disk stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , we cite high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) as the evidence for the present - day infall ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the infall operates in the gce models so as to enrich the ism efficiently in the early phase to suppress the number of metal - poor stars , and maintain the star formation activity by continuously suppling the gas .",
    "this established view predicts a monotonic increase ( decrease ) in heavy elements ( d ) in the ism up to the solar abundances ( ( d / h)@xmath172.0@xmath15 ) . in this way",
    ", the evolution of d is tightly bound to the production of metals in star formation .",
    "but what if a significant fraction of the heavy elements in the disk does not originate from _ in situ _ star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this represents a radical departure from conventional gce models and has recently been discussed in detail . here",
    "large - scale winds from the galactic bulge , which entrain a large amount of heavy elements , enrich the disk .",

    "a part of heavy elements trapped in long - lived stars as well as in the gas of the disk is not related to the local star formation but the activity of the bulge .    in this paper",
    ", we shed light on the evolution of deuterium in the framework that the galaxy disk has evolved through `` wind + infall '' , together with the renewed constraint from the star formation history in the local disk .",
    "then we show that the combined phenomena of winds that entrain heavy elements and infall that contains primordial d will make the galaxy disk feature withstand the test of observations .",

    "the adf of solar neighborhood disk stars has been studied by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "spectroscopic observations of elemental abundances for metal - rich disk stars @xcite have confirmed that chemical enrichment in the solar neighborhood continued unabated until [ fe / h]@xmath1 + 0.4 .",
    "@xcite has claimed that the simultaneous reproduction of both the presence of stars with [ fe / h]+0.2 and [ fe / h]@xmath200 is hard to realize through the conventional scheme of local enrichment via low - metallicity gaseous infall from the halo , and that the presence of supersolar stars is crucial evidence for enrichment by winds from the bulge .",
    "it should be of note that the seeming making of supersolar stars by gce models thus far ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is an end result of convolution of the adf with a dispersion of 0.1 - 0.2 dex in [ fe / h ] .",
    "the convincing signature of wind enrichment is seen in their elemental features .",
    "nearby metal - rich stars are represented by an upturn in [ @xmath6/fe ] ratios except for [ o / fe ] against increasing [ fe / h]@xcite .",
    "such upturns can also be seen in other elements , such as odd elements ( na , al ) , and some iron - group elements ( ni , zn ) .",
    "it is incorrect to attribute these upturns to metallicity - dependent sn ii yields , especially because this feature is observed with both even- and odd - numberd elements .",
    "these features can be interpreted as a reflection of the elemental feature of winds from the bulge @xcite . since the [ @xmath6/fe ] ratios start to upturn from [ fe / h]@xmath21 , the wind enrichment is expected to occur around 5 gyr ago , corresponding to the time of sun s birth . from the above discussion on elemental feature , the galactic fountain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that may serve as a means for transporting metals to other locations in the disk is unlikely to contribute to acceleration of the chemical enrichment in the solar vicinity .",
    "on the other hand , radial mixing of disk stars due to resonant scattering with transient spiral waves predicts that contaminants coming from the inner disk populate the solar neighborhood ( sellwood & binney 2002 ; rokar et al .",
    "2008a , b ; schenrich & binney 2009 ; snchez - blzquez et al .  2009 ) , and allows the presence of metal - rich stars beyond the upper limit of a local chemical enrichment @xcite .",
    "however , stars orbiting near the galactic center should exhibit a decreasing [ @xmath6/fe ] trend with increasing [ fe / h ] , as observed in the bulge @xcite .",
    "therefore , elemental features of nearby metal - rich stars seem at odds with the prediction of radial mixing as a mechanism of producing metal - rich stars",

    "@xcite has found that the radial [ fe / h ] gradient roughly from @xmath22=4 to @xmath22=14 kpc ( @xmath22 : galactocentric distance ) has flattened out in the last several gyr with a change in a slope of @xmath23 - 0.1 dex kpc@xmath24 to @xmath1 -0.05 dex kpc@xmath24 , by comparing the steep relic gradient observed in the open clusters with that observed in the cepheids ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "chemical evolution models predict contradictory time evolution of the metallicity gradient , i.e. , a steepening @xcite or a flattening @xcite .",
    "putting aside these contradictions , existing gce models predict a monotonic increase in abundances for each region , and the predicted gradient change is small compared with the observations .",
    "@xcite has claimed that large - scale winds from the galactic bulge are the crucial factor for its mechanism .",
    "their proposed scenario is ( i ) winds once set up a steep abundance gradient ( @xmath1 -0.1 dex kpc@xmath24 ) owing to the enrichment by heavy elements entrained in the winds , and ( ii ) later evolution leads to a flattening of abundance gradient through chemical evolution under an accretion of a low - metal gas from the halo .",
    "on the other hand , new analysis of planetary nebulae supports a slight steepening of the [ o / h ] gradient with time @xcite .",
    "this contradictory result is interesting because it is likely that winds from the bulge are not so metal - rich in o. the metal - rich bulge stars exhibit the low [ o / fe ] below the solar ratio @xcite .",
    "abundance of the microlensed stars recently analyzed confirmed [ o / fe]@xmath1 -0.2 for metal - rich bulge stars",
    "the reduced o yield of sn ii expected from these observations is probably due to efficient mass loss for massive stars , which prevents he and c from synthesizing into o within the metal - rich environment in the bulge @xcite .",
    "thus , o is not a good indicator for the wind enrichment that is predicted to cause the time evolution of the abundance gradient in our scheme .",
    "in other words , the time evolution of the [ o / h ] gradient could be possibly discussed in the conventional gce scheme as predicted by @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that some effect by radial mixing which causes a steepening of abundance gradient @xcite is seen in the evolution of o gradient owing to little influence of the wind enrichment .",
    "in addition , @xcite compiled a new data set of ages , [ fe / h ] , and distances for open clusters . from their samples , we make two groups : one is composed of young clusters whose ages are less than 1 gyr , and the other is of old ones whose ages range within @xmath25 gyr . here",
    "we restrict both of samples to the ones with @xmath2614 kpc . as a result",
    ", the least - square fitting gives a slope of -0.05 dex kpc@xmath24 for young clusters , and -0.14 dex kpc@xmath24 for old clusters , respectively .",

    "_ 3 . other signatures _    in the galaxy",
    ", there is now strong evidence for large - scale winds across the electromagnetic spectrum @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is tantalizing direct evidence that dust and gas from the inner galaxy have been transported to the solar neighbourhood @xcite . in standard chemical evolution models ,",
    "the isotopes @xmath27si and @xmath28si become more abundant than @xmath29si as the disk ages . but",
    "pre - solar grains from meteorites show evidence that the local isotopes formed in material that had experienced more nuclear synthesis than material that came after the sun s birth",
    ".      a driver of large - scale winds would be a starburst in the galactic bulge .",
    "therefore , our scenario proposes that the galactic bulge has a complex history involving at least one starburst episode around 5 gyr ago in addition to the initial burst that gave rise to the old population @xmath30 10 gyr ago . to date",
    ", the star formation history of the galactic bulge still remains an open question because we do not have the precise color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the bulge owing to the difficulty of discrimination of bulge stars from disk stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is good evidence for recent star formation in the nuclear region @xcite .",
    "in addition , from the perspective of bar formation , one might expect some star formation activity in the region of what is now the bulge , about 3 gyr after the inner disk started to form - this would be at the time when the bar buckling occurs @xcite - it would really stir up any remaining gas in the inner disk .",
    "it is difficult to conjecture how massive a starburst is likely to be from a viewpoint of a wind enrichment on the disk since there are too many uncertain factors to predict it . here",
    "we take a simplified case and show that a starburst which produce @xmath31 of the bulge stars might be one candidate , by checking supply and demand of fe . for simplicity ,",
    "the disk is here considered to be one zone represented by the solar circle .",
    "let us take the masses of a bulge and a disk and the gas fraction of a disk as @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and 0.1 .",
    "the imf with a slope of @xmath34= -1.05 @xcite together with the star formation producing the fraction of @xmath35 of bulge stars yields @xmath36 sne ii that eject @xmath37 of fe , some fraction of which will be , though , retained within the bulge . on the other hand , the fe abundance of gas in the disk should increase from [ fe / h]=0 to [ fe / h]=+0.3 by the wind enrichment plus the local enrichment by star fromation .",
    "it means that the winds should entrain roughly the same amount of fe as that already present in the ism to double the fe abundance if we neglect the local fe production . in the end , the total fe mass necessary for the additional enrichment on the disk amounts to @xmath38 , equivalent to the former estimate .",
    "if we assume that the wind enrichment is restricted to the inner disk including the solar vicinity together with a partial contribution to the winds from type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) and hypernovae that eject high fe masses , the necessary fraction of stars produced in a burst will significantly decrease like @xmath39 1% .    while numerous studies @xcite agree that the bulk of the bulge formed @xmath3010 gyr , a minority population of stars as young as 5 gyr can not be ruled out , and a minor burst of star formation as recent as 5 gyr may have taken place in the bulge .",
    "the fraction of stars produced by such a minor burst must be small like @xmath40% as implied by an above simplified estimate so as not to contradict the present cmds , but in practice , how much of stars the starburst was likely to produce remains quite unclear .",
    "as well , the age of a burst claimed here is not definitive due to a lack of determinant factor of its age - dating .",
    "the results from microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars in the galactic bulge showing the average age of @xmath1 7 gyr for metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath30 0 ) bulge stars @xcite may be in favor of our hypothesis .",
    "recently , some authors claim that momentum - driven winds are an efficient mechanism for a powerful wind from the central starburst @xcite .",
    "these strong winds could realize a widespread enrichment over the disk , possibly including the outer disk region , through hydrodynamical interaction between the winds and the gaseous halo @xcite . in n - body hydrodynamic simulations",
    ", only high - resolution models can create inhomogeneous ism sufficient for the right treatment of winds from star - forming region ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "ongoing advanced numerical calculations will certainly reveal a full view of the wind enrichment .",
    "the main body of the galactic bulge was considered to be formed in a starburst @xmath30 10 gyr ago .",
    "it is natural that we expect the action of ravaging winds associated with this vast star formation .",
    "since the age of thin disk is as low as @xmath41 10 gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the signature of initial wind enrichment is likely to be unseen in the thin disk stars .",
    "instead , some fossil record should be imprinted in the formation of thick disk prior to thin disk .",
    "indeed , recent study claims that ages of the thick disk stars are @xmath308 - 9 gyr with a span of @xmath13 gyr @xcite , which suggests a similar formation epoch between thick disk and bulge .",
    "here we discuss compelling evidence for the contamination of a gas used for the thick disk formation by heavy elements entrained in the winds .",
    "the adf of thick disk shows a sharp increase from [ fe / h]@xmath42 to the peak located at [ fe / h]@xmath43 .",
    "this feature is first reported by @xcite with a small number of but complete samples , and the location of its peak is confirmed by a huge sdss data base of thick disk stars @xcite .",
    "these observational results suggest that a material for the proto - thick disk was pre - enriched up to [ fe / h]@xmath1 -1.3 at @xmath30 10 gyr ago .",
    "our claim is that the mechanism of pre - enrichment is attributable to the wind occurrence triggered by an initial starburst in the galactic bulge .",
    "detailed results of not only the adf but also the evolution of [ @xmath6/fe ] calculated with the wind models will be presented in tsujimoto ( 2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "in addition , similarity of stellar elemental features between bulge and thick disk recently revealed @xcite seems to have some connections to the wind phenomena during their overlapping formation episode .    from this viewpoint , metal - weak thick disk stars can be discussed .",
    "@xcite found that some fraction of low - metallicity stars in the range of @xmath44[fe / h]@xmath45 belong to the thick disk population . according to @xcite , addition of these stars to the adf deduced by @xcite",
    "does not form a metal - poor tail .",
    "rather , it produces another distinct distribution for [ fe / h]@xmath46 . in our view",
    ", metal - weak thick disk stars are regarded as the stars that are formed prior to the significant influence of metal - rich winds from the bulge on the proto - thick disk .",
    "we incorporate the enrichment process by large - scale winds into the standard gce model .",
    "the basic picture is that the disk was formed through a continuous low - metal infall of material from outside the disk region , and for a specific period heavy elements carried by winds from the bulge dropped and enriched the disk .",
    "the period of the occurrence of winds is set to be 4 - 6 gyr ago so as to reproduce the chemical features of metal - rich solar neighborhood stars as well as the observed flattening of abundance gradient in the last several gyr @xcite .",
    "the abundances of the winds are set to be identical to the ejecta of type ii sne ( sne ii ) such as [ fe / h]=+0.4 , [ mg / fe]=+0.4 , and [ o / fe]=-0.2 .",
    "a low o abundance in the wind is implied by the bulge abundance @xcite .",

    "now we are all set to start on the discussion of d / h evolution .",
    "the predicted time - evolution of d / h is shown in figure 3 . here the primordial ( d / h)@xmath0 is set to be 2.75@xmath2 @xcite . from its initial value ,",
    "the d / h abundance starts to decrease with time , and subsequently its change turns to a gradual increase 4 gyr ago .",
    "this turnover results from the supply of primordial d by an infall that overwhelms the destruction of d through star formation owing to its low rate .",
    "then , it finally enables to achieve a present - day high d / h abundance of 2.3@xmath2 , fully consistent with the observed value @xcite , after passing d / h @xmath64 equivalent to the protosolar value @xcite around 4.6 gyr ago . for reference , the case with a constant @xmath59 ( = 0.6 ) over the full age is indicated by dashed line .",
    "our safe conclusion is that the d / h abundance has little evolution during the last several gyr , as if the d astration through star formation has turned off .",
    "it s because the metallicity of an infall would change in accordance with the cosmic evolution of damped ly@xmath6 systems @xcite , and eventually become subsolar with a smaller d than the primordial value like complex c @xcite .",
    "this view will lead to a flattening of d / h evolution rather than its gradual increase .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the uncertainties in two key observational constraints that largely influence the results presented here . as discussed below , neither of two has reached a firm consensus yet , thus further studies to better understand these issues , observationally and theoretically , should be still awaited .      in our models , we adopt a sharply decreasing sfr which changes a factor of @xmath65 in the last 4 gyr deduced by @xcite . their result is broadly consistent with other several works using different methods @xcite . however , at least two studies present a different picture for the recent sfr . @xcite",
    "derive the star formation history , using a chromospheric age distribution of dwarf stars , and their major finding is that the disk has experienced a few bursts in the past , in which one of enhanced episodes of star formation occurred during the last 1 gyr .",
    "on the other hand , from a new reduction of hipparcos data combined with updated isochrones , @xcite obtain the deceasing sfr from the past to the present but at a very small rate .    with no doubt , major progress on this issue will come from a huge database brought by gaia in the next decade .",
    "the controversial situation on the representative value of ( d / h)@xmath8 is nicely reviewed in ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . although most claims seem inclined to be above ( d / h)@xmath8 @xmath66 , that is beyond the predictions by the conventional gce models , very low values such as ( d / h)@xmath671.5@xmath2 of the local bubble value or @xmath10.98@xmath2 of the highest column density regions @xcite can not be still discarded .",
    "the difficulty lies in the interpretation of a widespread variation in the observed gas - phase d / h ratios among local ism regions .",
    "it seems reasonable to claim that the ism exhibiting a high d / h such as @xmath12.2 - 2.3@xmath2 is a result of incompletely mixed infall , i.e. , a strong influence by a low - metal infall ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since complex c has a similar d / h of 2.2@xmath2 .",
    "however , it is stemmed by a counterargument that their o abundance is not so low as that expected in an infalling gas @xcite .",
    "recently , analysis of linsky s data by a bayesian approach gives the best estimate of ( d / h)@xmath672.0@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a reduction of @xmath68 draws the observed ( d / h)@xmath8 close to the compatibility with some of gce models .",
    "however , considering an uncertainty in the adopted probability distribution for depletion as well as an indication of high d in wnm @xcite , further studies with more data is still necessary for the settlement of a true ( d / h)@xmath8 . besides , recall that the observed d / h abundance only gives a lower limit of ( d / h)@xmath8 .    to date , a high ( d / h)@xmath8 as proposed by @xcite is viewed with a skeptical eye owing to an incompatibility with the theoretical gce scheme .",
    "here we propose a new path to end up with ( d / h)@xmath692.3@xmath2 .",
    "accordingly , we claim a need to have a fresh look at those observed high d / h , bearing in mind that they are within the predictions of a renewed gce picture .    ,",
    "[ mg / fe ] , and d / h . _ left panels _ : solid and dashed lines represent the results by the model with the decreasing sfr and with a constant sfr coefficient , respectively , under the assumption of no winds . _ right panels _ : same as in left panels but for an introduction of the winds . ]",
    "finally , let s review each role of the sharply decreasing sfr and the metal - rich winds that are the main drivers of the successful results through the comparison of two models",
    ". left panels of figure 4 show the time evolution of [ fe / h ] , [ mg / fe ] , and d / h calculated with the model in which the sharply decreasing sfr for the last 4 gyr is incorporated into the gce scheme .",
    "these witness that an inactive sf period makes the d / h evolution compatible with the observation , while leaving the problem of an incomplete chemical enrichment .",
    "then , the satisfactory enrichment is achieved by an introduction of the metal - rich winds into the model with the d / h feature unchanged ( right panels ) . for reference , in both models , the results calculated with a constant sfr coefficient are indicated by dashed lines .",
    "as long as we stick to the conventional scheme of chemical evolution , recent observational implications of ( i ) the present - day high d / h abundance and ( ii ) little evolution of its abundance during the last several gyr in the local disk are hard to believe .",
    "accordingly , the discussion on it so far has been inclined to favor a much lower present - day d / h abundance in terms of an uncertainty in its estimate mainly due to dust correction .    here",
    "we present a new view on the d / h evolution in the local disk , based on the theoretical scheme that considers the wind enrichment and the decreasing sfr with a rate of @xmath1 -0.8 gyr@xmath24 , two phenomena that are implied to have occurred in the last several gyr from the observed feature of local disk stars .",
    "the essence of its theory is that all heavy elements are not locally produced but some fraction comes form the outside , thus the models whose mission is the construction of the metal - rich system accept the observed low activity of star formation in the recent gyrs , and end up with the ism rich in d.    we insist that the local star formation does not suffice to produce all elements in - situ , and thus d does not destroy so much as expected by the chemical features of the local disk .",
    "similar claim may be seen in the mechanism of radial mixing @xcite , which brings metal - rich stars from the outside ( i.e. , the inner disk ) instead of heavy elements .",
    "@xcite show the star formation history for the local disk which exponentially decreases 1 gyr after the beginning of star formation , as implied by the new reduction of hipparcos data @xcite .",
    "their model succeeds in a high - z stellar abundance system as an outcome of radial migration of stars while it will surely predict a low d today .",
    "we strongly predict an ongoing infall onto the galaxy disk .",
    "our claim is that it operates to reduce the gas abundances in the disk . indeed , today s observed gas abundances are not metal - rich at any places of the disk .",
    "the metallicities of cepheids at the inner disk ( @xmath70 4kpc ) are [ fe / h]@xmath71 at the most @xcite . moreover , a surprisingly rsult is brought by supergiants in two young clusters in the innermost disk at @xmath47=3 - 4 kpc , whose metallicities are found to be [ fe / h]@xmath1 -0.1@xmath49 -0.2 @xcite .",
    "an infall must rain down on today s disk .",
