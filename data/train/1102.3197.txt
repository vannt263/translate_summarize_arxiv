    "the imagery and spectroscopy of extrasolar planets are among the most exciting and ambitious goals of contemporary observational programs .",
    "direct detection and characterization of faint objects around bright astrophysical sources is highly challenging due to the large flux ratio and small angular separation .",
    "for instance , self - luminous giant planets are typically @xmath4 times fainter than their parent star in the near - infrared . in this context , the worldwide emergence of high - contrast imaging instruments , e.g. , sphere @xcite , gpi @xcite , hiciao @xcite , or project 1640 @xcite will have the potential to dramatically enlarge the actual discovery space of exo - planets .",
    "these instruments will use extreme adaptive optics ( xao ) systems in association with coronagraphy to overcome the contrast issue .",
    "a coronagraph used in association with an ao system can improve the sensitivity of an imaging system to faint structures surrounding a bright source .",
    "these devices block the core of the image of an on - axis source and suppress the bright diffraction rings and halo that would otherwise reduce the dynamic range . the state - of - the - art of coronagraphy",
    "has impressively expanded during the past fifteen years , motivated by the detection and imaging of exoplanets , ideally down to earth - like planets .",
    "an extensive review of the different families of coronagraph was carried out by @xcite , where optimal solutions were proposed in the context of space - based observations .",
    "likewise , for ground - based instruments several concepts have been compared @xcite .",
    "coronagraphs can now provide a very large on - axis extinction as demonstrated in laboratory conditions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their performance are impacted by the large amount of residual phase aberrations that are left uncorrected by the ao system . although coronagraphy is a mandatory technique , this critical subsystem can only reduce the contribution of the coherent part of the on - axis starlight . as a result , coronagraphic on - sky capabilities strongly depend on the ao system performance .    in this context and in the framework of the sphere and epics (",
    "* for the future european - extremely large telescope ) instruments , we have developed and tested four different coronagraphic concepts : a four - quadrants phase mask @xcite , several lyot coronagraphs @xcite , an apodized - pupil lyot coronagraph @xcite , and a band - limited coronagraph @xcite .",
    "the objective is to compare their respective behavior under realistic conditions and to analyze their responses to the xao system .",
    "the selection of an optimal concept is a byproduct of this study as initiated in a previous study by means of simulations @xcite .",
    "these four prototypes were tested on hot , the high - order testbench @xcite , which reproduces realistic conditions at a telescope ( e.g. , vlt ) , including a turbulence generator , and a high - order adaptive optics system .",
    "hot provides a practical realistic environment ( e.g. , strehl ratio of 90@xmath2 in h - band under 0.5@xmath3 dynamical seeing ) to assess coronagraphic performance in the realm of high - contrast imaging instruments .",
    "therefore , this study intends to provide comparative insights of coronagraphic devices but can not address performance estimation of a particular concept for a real instrument .",
    "although hot provides a realistic environment for evaluating high - contrast techniques , it can not deliver similar design optimization and stability , nor operational conditions ( i.e. , observational and data reduction strategies , instrumental speckle suppression techniques , etc ... ) provided by real instruments currently in use ( project 1640 ) or being commissioned ( sphere , gpi , or hiciao ) .    in sect .",
    "2 we present the optical setup and experimental conditions , while in sect . 3 all coronagraphic concepts are described and details of their performance characterization are provided . in sect . 4 we discuss the laboratory results obtained under dynamical seeing and xao , and finally in sect .",
    "5 we draw conclusions .",
    "in the following we present two optical setups . the first one , the _ high - order testbench _",
    "is used to test coronagraphs under realistic conditions with dynamical seeing and xao correction , while the second one , the _ coronagraphic testbench _ , is a dedicated optical setup for the characterization of the coronagraph prototypes before their implementation and use on hot ( i.e. , to assess their intrinsic limitations ) .",
    "the latter corresponds to the near - ir arm of hot assuming minor modifications .",
    "the high - order testbench ( hot ) is a high - contrast imaging adaptive optics bench installed at the eso headquarters .",
    "it implements an xao system and a star and turbulence generator to create realistic conditions encountered at a telescope .",
    "it provides ideal conditions to study xao and coronagraphy .",
    "hot gathers several critical components as shown in fig .",
    "[ bench ] : a turbulence generator with phase screens to simulate real seeing conditions ( a ) , a vlt - pupil mask installed on a tip - tilt mount , and a 60-bimorph large stroke deformable mirror ( b ) , a 32@xmath532 micro deformable mirror ( d )  dm , electrostatic mems device  , a beam splitter transmitting the visible light to wavefront sensing either with a pyramid concept ( pwfs , e ) , or a shack - hartmann ( shwfs , f ) , while the infrared light is directed towards a coronagraph ( g ) and an infrared camera ( 1k@xmath51k hawaii detector , h ) , and the eso sparta real - time computer ( rtc ) .",
    "all the optics are set on a table with air suspension in a dark room and are fully covered with protection panels forming a nearly closed box .",
    "after the generation of the dynamical aberrations , the output f/16.8 beam is transformed into an f/51.8 beam by a spherical on - axis mirror ( c ) , and directed towards the pupil plane located about 1010 mm above the table level , with its axis tilted at 13.26 degrees as in the vlt coude train .",
    "after that , relay optics prior to the beam splitter use flat mirrors and spherical mirrors to produce an f/50 telecentric beam .",
    "all relayed optics in the ir - path are made with ir achromatic doublets .",
    "the shack - hartmann wavefront sensor ( f ) , developed by the university of durham , provides a plate scale of 0.5@xmath3/pixel with 31x31subapertures , each ones sampled by 4x4 pixels of a 24 @xmath6 m pixel size l3-ccd ( andor camera , read - out noise @xmath7 1e- ) .",
    "the shwfs real - time computer is an all - cpu architecture .",
    "while not used during the experiment , hot contains a pyramid wavefront sensor built by arcetri @xcite , which is formally equivalent to the lbt wavefront sensor optical design , and consists in a double refractive pyramid modulated by a tip - tilt mirror , combined with an l3ccd - camera .",
    "the pwfs uses a dedicated all - cpu rtc .",
    "the input source for hot is a white - light source combined either with an ir narrow - band filter of @xmath8 = 1.4@xmath2 , central wavelength of 1.64 @xmath6 m , or a broadband h filter centered on 1.6 @xmath6 m , @xmath8 = 24@xmath2 , fed in by an 8 @xmath6 m fiber .    in the science arm of hot ( ir - path ) , a pupil - imager system is implemented for coronagraphic components alignment purpose .",
    "all pupil - plane coronagraphic components are placed into opto - mechanical mounts that allow x- , y- , focus and rotation adjustment , while focal - plane masks can be adjusted in x- , y- , focus and tip - tilt .",
    "it is fundamental to evaluate the intrinsic capabilities and limitations of each coronagraphic concepts on a dedicated optical testbench before testing the coronagraphs on hot under dynamical seeing and xao correction .",
    "this is essential to appropriately interpret experimental contrast results obtained on hot afterwards , i.e. , to distinguish the impact of the aberrations left uncorrected by the xao system from the limitations introduced by the coronagraph prototypes themselves . in practice",
    "this is possible by using the science arm of hot ( near - ir optical path ) as an independent coronagraphic optical setup .",
    "the relevant modifications made on the science arm of hot are described in fig .",
    "[ bench2 ] where one can compare the standard configuration ( top ) to that of the coronagraphic testbench configuration ( bottom ) .",
    "the main difference comes from the fact that a flat mirror used to fold the beam after the dm is replaced by an entrance fiber , which is used as a star source for the optical setup ( 6.6 @xmath6 m diameter ) .",
    "the coronagraphic testbench uses a vlt - pupil mask made in a laser - cut , stainless - steel sheet .",
    "the dimensions and positioning of the vlt - pupil in both the coronagraphic testbench and hot are alike .",
    "the strehl ratio of the coronagraphic testbench was evaluated in the @xmath9-band to be 93@xmath2 @xmath10 1@xmath2 by measuring the peak - intensity ratio of the experimental psf to that of the theoretical psf normalized to the total intensity .",
    "the theoretical psf is created through two different methods , both leading to the same strehl ratio : ( 1/ ) by performing the forward fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the autocorrelation of an oversampled and uniformly illuminated entrance pupil image from our telescope pupil mask , ( 2/ ) by performing the fft of a simulated aperture function with radius determined from the experimental psf on the basis of photometric criteria .    as high - frequency wavefront components impose an important contrast limitation , we determined the wavefront error of the optical components prior to the pupil - stop in the coronagraphic testbench to an overall total amount of @xmath11 rms at 1.6 microns , i.e. , 24 nm rms @xcite .",
    "all the parameters described below are identical when operating with the hot or the coronagraphic testbench : the vlt - pupil in the first pupil - plane of the ir arm has 3 mm diameter , a central obscuration of 0.47 mm , and 4 spider - vanes with 15 @xmath6 m thickness .",
    "the coronagraphic focal masks are installed at an f/48.4 beam .",
    "the pupil is re - imaged in the lyot plane where the pupil - stop is installed , and appears with similar dimensions as in the first pupil - plane of the ir arm .",
    "all re - imaging optics are made with @xmath12/10 achromatic ir doublets .",
    "therefore , all coronagraphs can be tested similarly on hot and on the coronagraphic testbench .",
    "several metrics can be used to quantify the capability of a coronagraph to suppress the on - axis starlight :    * the _ rejection rate ( @xmath13 ) _ : ratio of total intensity of the direct image to that of the coronagraphic image .",
    "* the _ peak rejection rate ( @xmath14 ) _ : ratio of the maximum intensity of the direct image to that of the coronagraphic image . *",
    "the _ contrast ( @xmath15 ) _ : ratio of the coronagraphic image at a given angular separation to that of the maximum of the direct image to the intensity , azimuthally averaged .",
    "in addition , as contrast evaluation is no longer suitable on post - processed coronagraphic images , the azimuthal standard deviation  quantifying the ability to pick out a companion at a given angular distance  will be applied in such situation .",
    "the azimuthal standard deviation is measured in a ring of width @xmath16 on the post - processed image , i.e. , it includes all pixels within one resolution element .",
    "although the detectability is commonly estimated at the level of 5@xmath17 on real data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and since we are not sensitive to confidence level threshold with our data , we quantify the detectability at the level of 1@xmath17 .",
    "we adopt the azimuthal contrast and standard deviation as primary metrics although we note they are conservative estimates , and that other criteria adapted to the case of high - contrast images have been discussed by @xcite .",
    "the design of the coronagraph pupil - stops ( fig . [ stops ] ) emphasizes the minimization of diffraction effects ( concentration of light around the edges , spider vane structures , and central obscuration ) while preserving the throughput .",
    "all pupil - stops have been optimized following the metric presented in @xcite , which attempts to maximize the ratio of the off - axis psf throughput to the stellar diffraction residuals with the use of homothetic stop - patterns ( same shape as the vlt - pupil but under / over sized ) .",
    "this optimization is performed at the operating wavelength in a wavefront error - free condition ( i.e. , strehl equal to 100@xmath2 ) .",
    "the performance of the coronagraph combined with the optimized pupil stop is afterwards compared with intrinsic or external limitations affecting the coronagraph efficiency ( e.g. , stellar size , chromaticism ... ) . based on the analysis of this budget error and accounting for alignment considerations the optimized pupil stop",
    "is retained , relaxed , or further optimized .",
    "a smooth and flat chromaticity response of the coronagraph is paramount for exoplanet detection as broadband observations are required for spectroscopy .",
    "for instance , most of the next generation of high - contrast imaging instruments will use integral field spectroscopy for data collection . analyzing coronagraphic performance in a large range of small bandwidths",
    "would therefore be extremely relevant .",
    "but it requires a dedicated optimization of each coronagraph that can only be carried out in correlation with specific observation and data reduction strategies , which is beyond the scope of this study and beyond the capabilities of our experimental setup .",
    "therefore the chromatic propagation ( contrast vs. wavelength ) of each coronagraph can not be addressed in this study , although it is certainly a relevant comparative criterion .",
    "in this section , we provide details of our four coronagraph prototypes and their performance .",
    "we first examine the impact of several error sources on their respective efficiency by probing the effect of manufacturing , wavefront error , chromaticity , and the source diameter . a performance characterization realized on the coronagraphic testbench will be presented and discussed afterwards .",
    "this first study is a prerequisite for proper analysis and interpretation of the results obtained on hot under dynamical seeing and xao correction , i.e. , to identify the limitations occurring in the coronagraphic images .",
    "the four - quadrant phase mask ( fqpm ) is a phase coronagraph proposed by @xcite .",
    "the mask divides the focal plane into four areas , two of which being @xmath18 phase - shifted . as a result",
    ", a destructive interference occurs in the relayed pupil , where the on - axis starlight is rejected and filtered by an appropriate pupil - stop .",
    "this concept has been studied from a theoretical point of view @xcite , in the laboratory @xcite , and has provided on - sky results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our prototype was manufactured by gepi ( galaxies etoiles physique et instrumentation ) in collaboration with lesia ( laboratoire detudes spatiales et dinstrumentation en astrophysique ) both from the paris observatory .",
    "the prototype is a monochromatic device , i.e. , the @xmath18 phase shift is obtained at a single wavelength .",
    "achromatic fqpms can be made using half - waves plates ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sphere coronagraph ) , agpm ( annular groove phase mask , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or ovc ( optical vortex coronagraph , * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that achromatic implementation of the fqpm exist @xcite .",
    "the fqpm is manufactured by engraving of two opposite quadrants on an optical medium .",
    "the substrate is made in infrasil 301 with 16 mm diameter and 3 mm thickness ( @xmath10 0.1 mm ) . the optical quality for the two faces is @xmath12/20 peak - to - valley at 633 nm . the thickness ( e ) and optical index ( n ) of the layer has been defined to provide a @xmath18 phase shift at the operating wavelength @xmath19 = 1.65 @xmath6 m ( @xmath9-band ) following : @xmath20 as the thickness of the fqpm step ( e ) directly defines the optimal wavelength at which the attenuation is best , an error between specified and manufactured step reduces the of the fqpm efficiency .",
    "our specification was e = 1.89 @xmath6 m @xmath10 3 @xmath2 .",
    "a dedicated visible spectroscopic bench was used at lesia to measure the thickness of the fqpm step @xcite by measuring the wavelength corresponding to the optimal nulling in the near - ir . in practice",
    "this facility enables to record low resolution spectra with a source centered on the fqpm ( coronagraphic spectrum ) and with the source out of the fqpm ( direct spectrum ) .",
    "the ratio of these two spectra allows one to identify different coronagraphic minima that correspond to a phase difference between the quadrant of @xmath21 ( with k = 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 and so on ) . from results of a given identified order in the visible ( odd value of k ) , it is straightforward to derive from these data and from the known optical index of the material , the operating wavelength of the fqpm ( @xmath19 ) at @xmath22 .",
    "equation [ eq4q ] can then be used to extract the thickness ( e ) .",
    "while a precision of less than 3@xmath2 was required , a depth accuracy of 0.2@xmath2 was finally obtained after several runs .",
    "ideally the transition between the four quadrants must be infinitely sharp .",
    "departure from this ideal case decreases the capability of the real device .",
    "microscopic inspection of the manufactured fqpm have shown that the transition quality is faster than 1 @xmath6 m ( 2 @xmath6 m peak - to - peak transition ) .",
    "the accuracy on the quadrant orthogonality has been measured to be @xmath23 0.8 arcmin .",
    "the manufactured fqpm is sensitive to several parameters as discussed previously ( table [ fqpmtable ] ) .",
    "specific care has been taken when defining the pupil - stop ( fig .",
    "[ stops ] , left ) in order not to allow higher rejection rate than the limit imposed by inherent parameters from the prototype .",
    "it is indeed useless to define an aggressive pupil - stop in diffraction - limited regime but rather convenient to save throughput through a relaxed optimization when external error sources , e.g. , the stellar leakage , chromaticity , will first set the limitation in the efficiency of the coronagraph",
    ". table [ fqpmtable ] quantifies all manufacturing defects and error sources that impact the fqpm efficiency , and will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "these data were used during the optimization process .",

    "the pupil stop throughput is about 92@xmath2 .      in the coronagraphic testbench we installed the entrance - pupil mask ( vlt - like pupil ) and the apodizer mask in the same collimated beam because of the lack of space .",
    "therefore , the apodizer can not be in practice in the same plane as the vlt pupil mask . to minimize this imaging issue",
    ", the apodizer was placed inside a rotating adjustable - length lens tube that allows translation motion along the collimated beam , and was adjusted at @xmath253.5 mm from the pupil mask .",
    "the aplc performance is presented in table [ corotable ] , where an order of magnitude discrepancy ( mostly in the halo ) was found between theory and measured data @xcite .",
    "some error sources impact the aplc performance , such as the apodizer profile error ( @xmath27 ) , or the defocus between the apodizer and the pupil plane ( @xmath28 ) although the depth of focus at the pupil is @xmath257 mm .",
    "because the quality of the optical setup also plays a role it is difficult to estimate the respective impact of each aspects .",
    "however , it is known that the apodizer positioning error in focus mainly affects the halo level , while the apodizer profile error affects both peak level and contrast in the halo .",
    "in addition , typical defects that occur at the level of the focal mask ( pointing error , defocus ) and at the pupil - stop ( shear and rotation ) impact the aplc performance as well .",
    "all these aspects acting together may explain the discrepancy between data and theory .",
    "the contrast evolves from @xmath29 at close angular separations ( @xmath30 ) to @xmath31 at best at farther separations ( @xmath32 ) .",

    "[ images ] ) present similar features : the coronagraphic images demonstrate starlight attenuation , and exhibit higher energy level at close angular separations ( from the center of the image to basically the iwa ) due to diffraction residuals and pinned speckles .",
    "a radial trend in speckle intensity is observable in the ) .",
    "the ao cut - off frequency is clearly observable in all images as its position in the field is identified by the slope of intensity in the speckle field at 0.6@xmath3 from the images center ( as expected ) . + diffraction resulting from the spider - vanes structures of the vlt - pupil is apparent in the images .",
    "the shape and extent of the central pattern of each coronagraphic image are influenced by the nature of the coronagraph ( we remind the reader that iwa are different pending on the coronagraphic concept considered , see table [ resumtable ] ) .",
    "for instance , the fqpm image exhibits the expected fqpm butterfly - like pattern with the four blind - zones introduced by the quadrant transitions on the mask .",
    "while the fqpm iwa is the sharpest one , more energy is observable close to the star with this coronagraph due to the impact of the central obscuration .",
    "the hpf images ( fig .",
    "[ images2 ] ) correspond to coronagraphic images removed from smooth structures ( i.e. , atmospheric speckle halo ) , while small - scale high - frequency components remain alike .",
    "four ghosts originating from reflections in the optical system before the coronagraph ( indeed upstream of the ir - path of hot , and potentially taking origin from the protecting window of the deformable mirror , or the beam splitter ) are observable as bright psfs in all images .",
    "none of them are observable in the images recorded on the coronagraphic testbench ( sect . [ proto ] ) .",
    "figure [ ghosts ] ( left ) presents a close view of the aplc hpf image where the four ghosts ( quoted a , b , c , and d ) are observable .",
    "these ghosts are virtually similar in intensity in all coronagraphic images , although few differences are measurable due to the fact that coronagraph pupil - stops are not similar and modify the width of the psfs . in addition the non - constant radial transmission of the blc mask at large radii also introduce some differences .",
    "ghost a , b , c , and d are localized in the field at 0.4@xmath3 , 0.7@xmath3 , 0.5@xmath3 , and 0.9@xmath3 , with peak intensity ( 1@xmath17 ) of @xmath255 @xmath47 , @xmath255 @xmath47 , @xmath252 @xmath47 , and @xmath253 @xmath48 respectively .",
    "all coronagraphs approximately deliver similar contrast levels from 5@xmath16 to 15@xmath16 ( ao cut - off frequency , see fig .",
    "[ results1 ] and table [ corotable2 ] ) .",
    "likewise , detectability obtained on hpf images is comparable ( fig .",
    "[ results2 ] ) .",
    "performance essentially differs from the center of the image to the iwa ( different from a concept to another ) .",
    "small iwa concepts ( e.g. fqpm ) deliver similar performance in the ao control domain as others , but the peak rejection rate is lower . while large iwa concepts ( lc(3 ) or blc ) deliver very high peak rejection rate , contrast levels are not improved in the ao control domain .",
    "more standard iwa concepts ( lc(1 ) , lc(2 ) , or aplc ) stand in - between ( improved peak rejection rate with respect to small iwa concepts , with similar contrast levels in the halo ) .    from the total rejection obtained with the fqpm in narrow band and the budget error defined in table [ fqpmtable ]",
    "we can derive an estimation of the wavefront error after xao ( conservative assessment , i.e. , all other error sources apart from the ones described in table [ fqpmtable ] are neglected ) . in the case of hot the size on",
    "the source is 8@xmath6 m ( 0.1@xmath16 ) instead of 6.6@xmath6 m ( coronagraphic testbench ) , then the total rejection imposed by the stellar diameter changes from 1380 to 930 .",
    "we obtain an estimate of the wavefront error after xao to be of the order of @xmath49 rms at 1.64@xmath6 m , i.e. , @xmath2590 nm rms .",
    "this value is consistent with the 90@xmath2 strehl estimation at the same wavelength , i.e. , @xmath25@xmath50 rms , and reads realistically considering the 50 nm rms static aberrations measurement of the common path ( left uncorrected by the 60-bimorph dm ) , and the 24 nm rms static aberrations estimation of the non - common path ( ir - path , high - frequency wavefront error prior to the pupil - stop ) .",
    "a rough estimation of the ao residual wavefront error would therefore be at the level of @xmath2516 nm rms .",
    "+ when the atmospheric residual halo is removed by post - processing ( hpf images , fig .",
    "[ results2 ] ) , the detectability levels obtained either almost achieved the intrinsic limitation of the coronagraphs ( a factor of 2 to 6 for the fqpm , or the aplc ) , or roughly attained the coronagraph limitation ( lcs ) .",
    "the blc case is particular as more than an order of magnitude difference remains between hpf contrasts and the actual limits imposed by the blc prototype .",
    "these results indicate that an improvement in the wavefront error control would be advantageous for the blc , while only a slight improvement can be obtained with the fqpm and aplc , and none with the lcs .",
    "as the azimuthal standard deviation ( detectability ) is a conservative estimate and the hpf images do not exhibit azimuthally uniform speckle noise distribution ( i.e. , spider vane residual structures are observable ) more favorable detectabilities than the one presented in table [ corotable2 ] are locally evident . therefore , by analyzing the hpf images in favorable areas that exclude remnant spider vane patterns ( fig .",
    "[ ghosts ] , right ) we can derive uppermost detectability levels reachable in each hpf image .",
    "results are gathered in fig .",
    "[ results3 ] and demonstrate an improvement of the detectability that is a function of the angular separation and the coronagraph .",
    "basically , the improvement evolves from a factor 2 to 4.5 ( from 3 to 12@xmath16 ) , and can nearly differ by a factor of 1.5 from a concept to another .",
    "finally , it brings the agreement of performance between all coronagraphs even more closer than previously presented .    additionally , because we obtained lower performance than the one presented in table [ corotable2 ] with the blc when combined with its pupil - stop ( fig .",
    "[ stops ] , right ) , the results presented here correspond to the blc used with the lc pupil - stop ( less aggressive , fig .",
    "[ stops ] , second pattern from the left ) .",
    "in such situation , a contrast improvement by a factor varying from 1.3 to 2.1 was obtained in the halo , while the gain in throughput is about 18@xmath2 .",
    "this indicates that in real situation the use of an aggressive pupil stop with a blc can be avoided even with a sophisticated entrance pupil ( at least in a strehl ratio @xmath5190@xmath2 regime ) .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of a well - balanced error budget when designing complex systems .",
    "+ the chromaticity impact is found negligible in the ao control domain , influencing contrast levels at minimum by a factor below 2 to a maximum of 5 .",
    "nearly all the impact is found in the area confined between the central core of the psf and the iwa ( e.g. , the peak rejection rate , see table [ corotable2 ] ) .    l|l|l|l|l|l|l| & bw ( @xmath2 ) & @xmath13 & @xmath14 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 & @xmath54 +   + fqpm & 1.4 & 29 & 62 & 1.5 @xmath55 & 9.7 @xmath48 & 3.8 @xmath48 + & 24 & 16 & 41 & 2.2 @xmath55 & 1.6 @xmath47 & 5.8 @xmath48 + lc ( 1 ) & 1.4 & 65 & 244 & 1.0 @xmath55 & 1.6 @xmath47 & 6.1 @xmath48 + & 24 & 57 & 191 & 1.4 @xmath55 & 2.3 @xmath47 & 1.0 @xmath47 + lc ( 2 ) & 1.4 & 55 & 183 & 8.9 @xmath47 & 1.2 @xmath47 & 4.6 @xmath48 + & 24 & 71 & 268 & 1.2 @xmath55 & 2.0 @xmath47 & 8.7 @xmath47 + lc ( 3 ) & 1.4 & 184 & 1719 &  & 1.3 @xmath47 & 6.2 @xmath48 + & 24 & 103 & 767 &  & 2.1 @xmath47 & 9.2 @xmath48 + aplc & 1.4 & 69 & 174 & 6.6 @xmath47 & 1.1 @xmath47 & 4.6 @xmath48 + & 24 & 46 & 118 & 1.4",

    "this paper studies the efficiency of several coronagraphic concepts under realistic conditions and provides insights on their use in the context of forthcoming planet - finder instruments .",
    "we selected and developed prototypes of various concepts ( fqpm , lc , aplc , and blc ) and evaluated their performance under 0.5@xmath3 dynamical seeing corrected by an xao system to a 90@xmath2 strehl ratio . + the delivered coronagraphic performances have been analyzed at two levels of contrast : +  considering the residuals of the xao system , +  when this residual halo has been removed by post - processing .",
    "+ in this context , similar conclusions are derived for both contrast levels regardless of the coronagraphic concept .    * at strehl ratio @xmath25 90@xmath2 all coronagraphs deliver similar contrast levels from iwa to the ao cut - off frequency and are therefore suitable for such xao performance . * when the residual ao wavefront error is removed by post - processing , similar detectability",
    "is delivered by all coronagraphs .",
    "* as contrast levels are similar at larger angular separations than the iwa for all concepts , performance estimates for signal - to - noise predictions for real observations ( exposure time calculation ) with multi - coronagraph instruments ( e.g. , sphere ) can in principle be achieved regardless of the coronagraphic concept . *",
    "increasing the iwa of a coronagraph ( e.g. , lcs , or blc ) does not provide better contrast , but increases the peak rejection .",
    "the peak rejection improvement varies from a factor @xmath254 to @xmath2530 when the iwa increases from a factor 2 to 4 respectively ( by comparing the fqpm to the lcs for instance ) .",
    "this aspect is important as wavefront errors downstream of the coronagraph produce quasi - static speckles that are proportional to the residual peak intensity . * as small iwa is critical to probe the innermost region of astrophysical objects ( basically only the fqpm offers the possibility to observe between 1 and 2 @xmath16 ) , efforts should be made to mitigate this level of residual energy in the center of the image by using , e.g. , a fqpm combined with a small lyot mask at its center , or by implementing mutli - fqpm designs @xcite .",
    "* at similar iwa the selection of a blc over a lc should be restricted to situations where the xao performance delivers better strehl ratio than 90@xmath2 .",
    "this confirms the predictions from @xcite , where similar strehl ratio regime was identified by means of simulations .    to take full advantage of a coronagraph",
    "the most demanding parameter is definitely the level of the wavefront control .",
    "the comparison of the coronagraphic contrast levels obtained on the two testbenches enables a differentiation for different levels of speckle noise , i.e. , when the speckle limitation is set by the instrumental non - common path aberrations of hot ( coronagraphic testbench ) ; and by either a combination of ao residual wavefront errors and instrumental common / non - common path aberrations ( hot , raw images ) , or common / non - common path aberrations only ( hot , hpf images ) .",
