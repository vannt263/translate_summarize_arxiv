    "we formulate the join construction as a certain continuous functor . in the case of real projective spaces",
    "it is a functor , which we denote @xmath28 , from the category @xmath29 of real finite dimensional vector spaces with inner product to the category @xmath30 of pointed spaces which sends the vector space @xmath4 to the block structure space of @xmath31 , the real projective space of @xmath4 .",

    "we make remarks on the other cases at the end of the introduction .",
    "the advantage of the formulation of the join construction as a continuous functor is that it enables us to use the orthogonal calculus of functors to study the block structure spaces of real projective spaces .",
    "the orthogonal calculus provides us with a general theory for studying continuous functors from @xmath29 ( as above ) to @xmath30 .",
    "it was developed by weiss in @xcite .",
    "he associates to a given continuous functor @xmath32 the tower of functors @xmath33 called the _",

    "@xmath35 in a certain sense and it is also the best approximation of @xmath32 by such a functor",

    "for example , the functor @xmath36 is defined by @xmath37 .",
    "it is the best approximation of @xmath32 by an essentially constant functor ( all induced maps @xmath38 are homotopy equivalences ) .",
    "thus the expansion is at _ infinity_. the functor @xmath32 is related to its taylor tower via natural transformations @xmath39 which fit together to form a commutative diagram . in favorable circumstances the maps @xmath40",
    "are highly connected for @xmath2 large .",
    "the idea of the calculus of functors is to obtain some information about the functor @xmath32 by investigating its taylor tower . for this purpose",
    "we need to estimate the connectivity of the maps @xmath41 .",
    "the best situation happens if the functor @xmath32 is polynomial of some degree @xmath35 .",
    "then the maps @xmath41 are homotopy equivalences for all @xmath42 .",
    "a continuous functor @xmath32 is called polynomial of degree @xmath35 if the canonical map @xmath43{cc } \\mathrm{holim } \\\\ [ -1 mm ] \\scriptstyle{0 \\neq u \\subseteq { \\mathbb{r}}^{k+1 } } \\end{array } } e({v \\ ! \\oplus \\",

    "there is a way how to verify that a given functor is polynomial of degree @xmath35 ; in the case @xmath45 we discuss it in detail in the paper .",
    "once the convergence question is established ( that means the connectivity of maps @xmath40 is known ) , the goal is to determine the taylor tower itself .",
    "this can be done via an important theorem in @xcite which says that the difference , @xmath46 , between the stages of the taylor tower of the functor @xmath32 is determined by a certain spectrum @xmath47 with an action of the orthogonal group @xmath48 .",

    "the homotopy groups of the spectrum @xmath57 are also determined .    * theorem [ thm2 ] . *",

    "there is another spectrum @xmath63 whose homotopy groups are @xmath64 for @xmath65 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the relationship between @xmath57 and @xmath63 is not yet clear to us , because we do not know any map between the two spectra .",
    "the results of theorems [ thm1 ] and [ thm2 ] can be used to provide a functorial description of spaces @xmath66 via the taylor tower of @xmath28 , if @xmath54 .",
    "for example by comparing the taylor tower of @xmath28 evaluated at @xmath67 and at @xmath4 we obtain the homotopy fibration sequence : @xmath68 \\rightarrow t_1f(0 ) \\rightarrow t_1f(v),\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the unit sphere in @xmath4 with the antipodal involution , the subscript @xmath70 denotes added base point and the subscript @xmath71 denotes the homotopy orbit spectrum .",

    "the relation between these spaces is via the homotopy fibration sequence ( [ two ] ) , which involves the block version of the space of self homeomorphisms @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath76 is any of the automorphism spaces above , the join construction provides us with maps @xmath77 for @xmath78 and the automorphism space @xmath79 of the infinite dimensional real projective space is defined as the colimit of @xmath80 over @xmath81 .",
    "the join maps commute with the maps in ( [ two ] ) and so we obtain the homotopy fibration sequence @xmath82 closely related to these spaces are also certain equivariant automorphism spaces discussed in a more detail below .",
    "we remark that the space @xmath83 defined below is a trivial double cover of @xmath84 and in @xcite it is shown that this space is homotopy equivalent to @xmath85 , where @xmath86 and the subscript @xmath70 denotes the added base point .",
    "therefore any information about the homotopy type of @xmath75 gives us also information about @xmath87 which is closely related to @xmath88 ( see @xcite for more information about the relation between various automorphism spaces , also note that for real projective spaces the word simple can be dropped as @xmath89 ) .",

    "* proposition 1.4.2 . ) . finally , these equivariant automorphism spaces of @xmath113 map into automorphism spaces of @xmath114 by passing to quotients , and this map is a trivial double cover .",
    "the splitting ( [ equiv - spaces ] ) then follows from ( [ two - stable ] ) because the join maps commute with the splittings ( [ htpy - splitting ] ) , ( [ top - stable - splitting ] ) and we have @xmath115    now we would like to briefly discuss the study of the block structure spaces of lens spaces and complex projective spaces . using the join construction we obtain in these cases a functor from the category of complex vector spaces with inner product to @xmath30 which sends the vector space @xmath4 to @xmath116 or @xmath117 .",
    "here we can employ the unitary calculus which is the complex analogue of orthogonal calculus , and we can try to run the study parallel to the case of real projective spaces .",
    "the case of lens spaces was studied by madsen and rothenberg in @xcite , where they show that the join maps induce isomorphisms on homotopy groups ( they also determine the homotopy groups , and later madsen in @xcite determines the homotopy type localized at @xmath118 and away from @xmath118 ) .",

    "the case of complex projective spaces is not covered in @xcite , so the parallel study would be interesting .",
    "we note that the main ingredient in the proof of theorems [ thm1 ] and [ thm2 ] is the codimension @xmath119 surgery theory , whereas in the case of complex projective spaces we have to use codimension @xmath118 surgery theory , which is considerably more complicated ( see @xcite ) . at the moment we are unable to carry over the whole proofs of theorems [ thm1 ] , [ thm2 ] .",
    "we hope to do this in the future .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ blockspace ]",
    "we introduce the block structure spaces . in section [ chap : suspension ]",
    "we construct the functor @xmath28 . in section [ chap : oc ]",

    "this involves studying a certain functor @xmath121 with some additional structure , which is called the first derivative functor of @xmath32 .",
    "section [ chap : f1 ] contains background material about codimension @xmath119 surgery theory , which is used to give a description of the first derivative functor @xmath122 . up to now",
    "we claim no originality",
    ". the description of @xmath122 will then be the main tool in the proofs of theorems [ thm1 ] and [ thm2 ] which are given in section [ chap : thetaf1 ] .",
    "the proofs are our contribution , and they are the core of the paper .",
    "we note that section [ chap : oc ] is a short survey of orthogonal calculus , however , for complete information we refer the reader to the original source @xcite . throughout the paper",
    "we also assume basic knowledge of surgery theory ( that means the book @xcite up to chapter 10 ) , but we provide some background about the less standard parts , such as codimension 1 surgery theory .    for @xmath42 by @xmath31",
    "we denote the real projective space of @xmath4 , by @xmath123 we denote the sphere with radius @xmath124 in @xmath4 ; and @xmath125 .",
    "in this section we introduce the block structure space of a closed manifold @xmath0 in general and we also introduce a method for constructing other models for the block structure spaces .",
    "the method will be used in section [ chap : suspension ] to obtain a functorial model of the block structure spaces of the real projective spaces .    in the introduction",
    "we have defined for a given closed manifold @xmath0 its simple structure set @xmath23 and more generally for a compact manifold with boundary @xmath126 the simple structure set @xmath127 .",
    "these are the basic objects of study of surgery theory which have been calculated in many special cases ( see for example @xcite , @xcite ) .    for a compact manifold @xmath0 the structure sets @xmath128 become groups when @xmath129 .",
    "the block structure space of @xmath0 is designed to be a space such that @xmath130 it is constructed as a @xmath131-set ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is a closed manifold then a @xmath2-simplex of @xmath17 is a simple homotopy equivalence @xmath132 between @xmath133-dimensional manifold @xmath134-ads , where @xmath135 ( the notion of a manifold @xmath134-ad is discussed below ) .",
    "the face operators are given by restrictions and the base point in dimension @xmath2 is @xmath136 .",
    "the construction of the space @xmath17 was given by quinn in @xcite .",
    "as indicated in the introduction the main motivation for studying this space comes from the fact that it is closely related to the automorphism spaces of @xmath0 .",
    "we refer the reader to the survey article @xcite for more information about this application . in (",
    "* theorem 2.3.1 . )",
    "it is also stated that @xmath17 fits into the homotopy fibration sequence of surgery theory of sullivan - wall - quinn - ranicki , which in principle determines its homotopy type .",
    "as already mentioned , when @xmath0 is the real projective space @xmath31 for some @xmath42 , we obtain an additional structure of maps between the block structure spaces of real projective spaces in different dimensions .",
    "these maps , called the _ join maps _ , were described on the homotopy groups by wall @xcite for @xmath137 and by madsen and rothenberg @xcite for @xmath138 , when @xmath139 .",
    "we generalize these maps to the level of spaces in a functorial way . for this",
    "we need another model of the block structure space of @xmath31 , that means a space homotopy equivalent to @xmath140 .",
    "the method for constructing such a space , which we describe in this section , is based on a careful analysis of quinn s model .",
    "the desired model is then constructed in two steps . in this section",
    "we construct an intermediate model @xmath141 , which also admits the join maps , as explained in @xcite . however",
    ", these do not define a functor because they do not behave well w.r.t . the composition .",
    "then , in the next section , we construct the functorial model @xmath142 .",
    "[ models ] each of the models @xmath140 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 has convenient properties in different situations . as they are all homotopy equivalent ( at least in high dimensions ) and as many of the results we need are only ` up to homotopy ' we switch between these models throughout the paper according to our needs .",
    "firstly we elaborate on the definition of a manifold @xmath134-ad .",
