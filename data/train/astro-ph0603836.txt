    "the hunt for planets outside our solar system has revealed 161 candidate planets in 137 stellar systems as of july 1 , 2005 , with 18 of these systems containing multiple planets .",
    "after the initial flurry of `` hot jupiter '' discoveries  primarily a selection effect due to two factors : ( 1 ) the nascent effort was biased toward discovery of short period systems , and ( 2 ) massive planets induce more readily detected radial velocity variations  it is now believed that the more massive planets preferentially lie farther away from the primary @xcite , perhaps leaving the space closer to the star for the harder to detect terrestrial planets . through these discoveries ,",
    "we are now poised to gain a better understanding of the environments of exoplanet systems and compare them to our solar system .",
    "our effort in this paper is focused on a key parameter of planetary systems  the stellar multiplicity status of exoplanet hosts .",
    "we address questions such as : ( 1 ) do planets preferentially occur in single star systems ( like ours ) , or do they commonly occur in multiple star systems as well ?",
    "( 2 ) for planets residing in multiple star systems , how are the planetary orbits related to stellar separations ?",
    "( 3 ) what observational limits can we place on disk or orbit disruptions in multi - star planetary systems ?",
    "this study contributes to the broader subjects of planetary system formation , evolution and stability through a better understanding of the environments of exoplanet systems .",
    "stellar multiplicity among exoplanet systems was first studied by @xcite , who looked at the first 11 exoplanet systems discovered and reported two binaries and one triple system .",
    "@xcite conducted an adaptive optics survey looking for stellar and sub - stellar companions to 25 exoplanet hosts and reported null results .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite reported 15 exoplanet systems with stellar companions in a comprehensive assessment , and additional companions have been reported for several specific systems @xcite .",
    "our effort confirms many of these previously reported systems , reports two new companions , identifies an additional candidate , and recognizes , for the first time , one triple and four binary exoplanet systems ( these are known stellar companions , but previously not noted to reside in exoplanet systems ) .",
    "our sample includes all known exoplanet systems detected by radial velocity techniques as of july 1 , 2005 .",
    "we primarily used the extrasolar planets catalog , maintained by jean schneider at the paris observatory ] , to build our sample list for analyses . to ensure completeness , we cross - checked this list with the california & carnegie planet search catalog ] .",
    "our sample excludes planets discovered via transits and gravitational lensing , as these systems are very distant , with poor or no parallax and magnitude information for the primaries .",
    "in addition , these systems can not be observed for stellar companions in any meaningful way .",
    "we also exclude a radial velocity detected system , hd 219542 , identified by @xcite as an exoplanet system with multiple stars , but since confirmed as a false planet detection by its discoverers @xcite .",
    "the final sample comprises 155 planets in 131 systems .",
    "this list is included in table  [ sample ] along with companion detection information , as described below .",
    "several efforts were carried out to gather information on stellar companions to exoplanet stars . to identify known or claimed companions",
    ", we checked available sources listing stellar companions  the washington double star catalog ( wds ) , the hipparcos catalog , the catalog of nearby stars ( @xcite , hereafter cns ) and @xcite .",
    "we also visually inspected the stsci digitized sky survey ( dss ) multi - epoch frames for the sky around each exoplanet system to investigate reported companions and to identify new common proper motion ( cpm ) companion candidates .",
    "we then confirmed or refuted many candidates through photometric distance estimates using plate magnitudes from supercosmos , optical ccd magnitudes from the ctio 0.9 m and 1.0 m telescopes , and infrared magnitudes from 2mass .",
    "the origin and status of each companion is summarized in table  [ results ] and described in  [ sec : notesys ] .",
    "table  [ sample ] lists each target star in our sample , sequenced alphabetically by name , and identifies all known and new companions .",
    "the first column is the exoplanet host star s name ( hd when available , otherwise bd or gj name ) .",
    "the second and third columns give the proper motion magnitude ( in seconds of arc per year ) and direction ( in degrees ) of the star , mostly from hipparcos .",
    "the fourth and fifth columns specify the observational epochs of the dss images blinked to identify cpm companion candidates .",
    "the sixth column lists the total proper motion , in seconds of arc , of the exoplanet host during the time interval between the two observational epochs of the dss plates .",
    "the seventh column identifies whether the proper motion of the star was detectable in the dss frames , allowing the identification of cpm candidates .",
    "the entries `` yes '' and",
    "`` no '' are self - explanatory , and `` mar '' identifies that the proper motion was marginally detectable .",
    "systems with very little proper motion or a brief separation between plate epochs could not be searched effectively ( see  [ sec : dss ] ) .",
    "the eighth column specifies companions identified via cpm , and the ninth column specifies companions listed in the sources mentioned above or in other refereed papers .",
    "following the companion i d indicates that the source remains a candidate , and could not be confirmed or refuted with confidence .",
    "the absence of a question mark indicates that the companion is confirmed .",
    "each reference we used for the companion search is described in the subsections below .",
    "we downloaded multi - epoch images of the sky around each exoplanet primary from the stsci digitized sky survey ] .",
    "the images of these surveys are based on photographic data obtained using the oschin schmidt telescope on palomar mountain and the uk schmidt telescope in australia .",
    "we typically extracted 10@xmath2 square images at two epochs centered on an exoplanet host star .",
    "the range of time interval between the epochs for a given target is 3.1 years to 46.2 years .",
    "figure  [ dss - hist ] shows a histogram of the number of systems per time interval bin for our sample .",
    "we identified cpm companion candidates by eye , by blinking the two epoch frames .",
    "in general , primaries with a total proper motion of @xmath3 3@xmath4 were effectively searched , while those with a total proper motion in the range of 2 @xmath5 3 @xmath4 were marginally searched , and stars with @xmath6 2 @xmath4 total proper motion could not be searched for companions using this method .",
    "exceptions to these ranges exist , and are due to poorly matched astrometric fields caused by specific issues with the plate images , such as saturation around the primary , distribution of background stars in the frames , brightness of the companion and its proximity to the primary , and the relative rotation between the frames .",
    "the 3@xmath4 detection limit corresponds to a proper motion range of 01 yr@xmath7 to 10 yr@xmath7 with a median value of 02 yr@xmath7 for the time intervals sampled .",
    "additionally , this method favors the detection of wide companions because bright primaries saturate the surrounding region out to many seconds of arc , and prevent companion detection within a @xmath1 15@xmath4 @xmath5 30@xmath4 radius , depending on source brightness . at the median distance of 35.6 pc for our sample",
    ", this translates to a minimum projected distance of @xmath1 500 @xmath5 1000 au .",
    "however , some bright companions can be picked up much closer , due to twin diffraction spikes or an anomalous psf compared to other stars in the field .",
    "for an outer limit , the 10@xmath2 image gives us a radius of 5@xmath2 , which translates to a projected distance of @xmath1 10000 au for the median distance of the exoplanet sample .",
    "this is of the order of magnitude of the canonical limit for gravitational binding , although @xcite listed several companions with separations larger than this .    of the 131 systems ,",
    "82 had easily detectable proper motions and hence were searched effectively for cpm companions , 7 had marginal proper motions , and 42 systems had no detectable proper motions .",
    "of the 82 systems searched effectively , 15 definite cpm companions were confirmed ( one per system ) , and 67 had no cpm companions detected within the search region outlined above .",
    "however , in 12 ( plus 3 candidates ) of these 67 systems , close companions were identified by other sources . in 3 ( plus 3 candidates ) of the 49 marginal or unsearched systems , companions were reported by other sources .",
    "these additional companions could not be detected by our method due to saturation around the primary , and/or a short time baseline between the dss image pair .",
    "the wds catalog ] is the world s most comprehensive database of multiple stars .",
    "however , it is a catalog of doubles , not binaries , so it explicitly contains an unknown number of non - physical chance alignments .",
    "table  [ wds - no ] lists 20 wds entries that are not gravitationally bound to the exoplanet host , but rather are field stars , listed in wds i d sequence ( column 1 ) .",
    "the second column is the hd identifier of the star .",
    "the third column is the component suffix of the pair , as it appears in the wds catalog , for which position angle , separation and epoch of the most recent observation are listed in columns four , five and six .",
    "the seventh column is the number of observations listed in the wds .",
    "note that a few of these `` companions '' have many observations , but they are not true companions .",
    "the eighth column identifies the specific method used to refute the wds entry .",

    "is easily identifiable in these images .",
    "as most of the exoplanet systems are close to the sun ( 128 of the 131 are within 100 pc ) , the hipparcos catalog ] provides fairly reliable distances and some photometric data for these systems .",
    "the catalog also notes some stellar companions , identified by field h59 as component solutions ( c flag ) , accelerated proper motion ( g flag ) , or orbital solutions ( o flag ) . in total , hipparcos identified stellar companions in nine exoplanet systems , four each with c and g flags , and one with the o flag",
    ". five of the nine hipparcos companions were independently confirmed , one ( hd 38529c ) is a close brown dwarf , and two ( both g flags ) remain as candidates .",
    "the @xmath8 crb system ( hd 143761 ) has an o flag , and contains a companion that is a planet @xcite or a star @xcite , but not both .      among our sample of 131 stars ,",
    "39 are listed in the cns .",
    "we reviewed the earlier versions of the catalog @xcite , as well as the consolidated information on the web ] .",
    "the catalog identifies any known companions , and lists separation , position angle and references in the notes section .",
    "twelve stars from our sample have companions listed in the cns , and every one of them was confirmed by other sources to be a true companion .",
    "the @xcite g dwarf survey specifically looked at multiplicity among solar - type stars in the solar neighborhood using radial velocity techniques .",
    "this is an ideal reference for our sample because searches for exoplanet systems have focused on such systems .",
    "@xcite identified target stars as single - line , double - line , or line - width spectroscopic binaries , or spectroscopic binaries with orbits .",
    "only three stars from our sample have companions listed in this reference , and each of these was confirmed by other sources to be a true companion .",
    "in addition to the proper motion investigation , we collected archival 2mass and supercosmos photometry as well as new ccd photometry that allowed us to compute distance estimates to companion candidates , as described below .",

    "the ninth column gives the number of observations available for the @xmath10 photometry .",
    "this is followed by 2mass @xmath11 photometry .",

    "the last three columns similarly list the ccd distance estimate , total error and the number of color relations used .",
    "we used the 2mass web database , accessed via the aladin interactive sky atlas ] @xcite to obtain equinox 2000 coordinates for the companion candidates , the epoch of observation , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 photometry .",

    "the sss plate photometry is calibrated by means of a network of secondary standard star sequences across the entire sky , with the calibration being propagated into fields without standards by means of the ample overlap regions between adjacent survey fields .",
    "the external accuracy of the calibrations is @xmath18 0.3 mag in individual passbands @xcite ; however the internal accuracy in colors ( e.g. @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) is much better , being typically 0.1 mag for well  exposed , uncrowded images .",
    "we used point source photometric measures in all cases .",

    "external errors represent a measure of the reliability of the relations for stars of known distance , which is estimated to be 26% in @xcite .",
    "because of the relatively large photometric distance errors associated with photographic plate photometry , we obtained optical ccd photometry for one exoplanet host and 13 companion candidates ( given in table  [ obs ] ) in the @xmath22 bands ( hereafter @xmath10 ) using the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 0.9 m and 1.0 m telescopes during observing runs in december 2003 , june , september and december 2004 , august and december 2005 , and march 2006 as part of the smarts ( small and moderate aperture research telescope system ) consortium .",
    "for the 0.9 m telescope , the central quarter of the 2048 @xmath23 2046 tektronix ccd camera was used with the tek 2 @xmath10 filter set . for the 1.0 m telescope , the y4kcam ccd camera was used with the harris 1 4mts @xmath24 and kc 1 4mts @xmath25 filter set .",
    "standard stars from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite were observed through a range of air masses each night to place measured fluxes on the johnson - kron - cousins @xmath10 system and to calculate extinction corrections .",
    "data were reduced using iraf via typical bias subtraction and dome flat - fielding , using calibration frames taken at the beginning of each night . in general , a circular aperture 14@xmath4 in diameter was used to determine stellar fluxes in order to match apertures used by @xcite for the standard stars . in cases of crowded fields , an appropriate aperture 2@xmath412@xmath4 in diameter",
    "was used to eliminate stray light from close sources and aperture corrections were applied . for one target ( hd 169830b )",

    "however , using ccd photometry , we get a distance of 54.0 @xmath18 9.3 pc , based on only 2 colors .",
    "the candidate companion is ccdm j13129 - 0213ab , a binary ( listed in the wds with a separation of 20 at 28@xmath33 ) , and hence , its actual distance is greater than photometrically indicated .",
    "we plotted the primary on the @xmath38 versus @xmath39 diagram using hipparcos data as described above , and it falls close to the main sequence fit , indicating that it is likely a single star .",
    "the candidate companion , based on its @xmath39 of 1.10 yields a distance of 36 pc , using the hipparcos plot , but its actual distance will be greater because it is a binary .",
    "our spectra for the two stars show very similar absorption lines , although the continuum seems to indicate that the candidate companion is slightly redder .",
    "given that the spectral types are close , and that the candidate companion is a binary while the primary appears to be single , we can only explain the large @xmath30v ( primary @xmath42 = 7.56 , and candidate companion @xmath42 = 9.78 ) by adopting significantly different distances to the two stars .",
    "hence , we conclude that this is not a gravitationally bound pair , despite the compelling proper motion match .",
    "our findings indicate that 30 ( 23% ) of the 131 exoplanet systems have confirmed stellar companions , and 6 more ( 5% ) have candidate companions . given the constraints of our search  any new companions we detected",
    "had to be widely - separated from primaries with high proper motion ",
    "these numbers should be regarded as lower limits .",
    "this point is confirmed by a recent paper , @xcite , which reported four new companions in exoplanet systems , of which we had independently identified only one ( hd 213240b ) .",
    "several interesting properties are revealed by this comprehensive assessment .",
    "three of the exoplanet systems ( hd 178911 , 16 cyg b , and hd 219449 ) are stellar triples , and are arranged similarly  a single planet orbits close to one star and there is a distant , tight binary . in each system , the three stars are all of the same spectral class ( g for hd 178911 and 16 cyg , and k for hd 219449 ) .",
    "we find it curious that all three triple systems contain stars of comparable mass ( i.e. systems such as a g - dwarf exoplanet host with a m - dwarf binary are not seen ) .",
    "could this be due to a selection effect ( i.e. faint companions are not as well studied for multiplicity ) or does this say something about the angular momentum distribution in star forming regions ?",
    "only a comprehensive survey of all companions for duplicity can lead us to an answer .",
    "it is interesting to note that recent exoplanet discoveries are predominantly found in single star systems . of the first 102 radial - velocity - detected exoplanet systems , 26 ( 26% )",
    "have confirmed stellar companions .",
    "in contrast , only 4 ( 14% ) of the latest 29 systems have confirmed stellar companions . even though we are dealing with small number statistics , we believe that this change is significant and worthy of further examination .",
    "our first inclination was that recent planet detections are at larger projected semi - major axes , and hence favor single systems because stellar companions would have to be even farther out to provide the uncorrupted `` single '' systems sought by radial velocity programs .",
    "however , we found no correlation between the timing of exoplanet reporting and its projected semi - major axis .",
    "so , we are not able to explain this curiosity at this point , and simply identify it for further examination .",
    "exoplanet hosts are deficient in having stellar companions when compared to a sample of field stars . our updated results for stellar counts in the exoplanet sample yield a single : double : triple : quadruple percentage of 79:21:2:0 for confirmed systems , and 72:24:4:0 considering candidates .",
    "while these are lower limits for multiplicity , they are significantly lower than the @xcite results of 57:38:4:1 for multiples with orbits , and 51:40:7:2 considering candidates .",
    "this is certainly due in part to the fact that planet searches specifically exclude known close binaries from their samples ( e.g. @xcite ) , and further eliminate any new binaries detected via radial velocity .",
    "we currently do not have enough detailed information about the exoplanet search target selection process to say whether the different multiplicity ratios are entirely due to selection effects , or is indicative of planetary disk instability and reduced planet formation in binary star systems .",
    "figure  [ orbits ] shows the a @xmath28 of planetary companions and projected separations of the stellar companions for the 30 confirmed exoplanets that reside in multiple star systems .",
    "the y - axis shows the sequence number of the exoplanet system as listed in column 1 of table  [ results ] .",
    "the figure clearly indicates the presence of separate planetary and stellar orbit regimes for the data currently available .",
    "all planets are within 6 au , and all stars are at a projected separation of greater than 20 au from the exoplanet host .",
    "note that all points in the figure can potentially move right because ( 1 ) planets are plotted at a separation of a @xmath28 , and ( 2 ) stars are plotted based on their projected separations ( although a few could move left if they have been caught near apastron in their orbits ) . the continued search for wider orbit planets will answer the question of whether this is simply due to selection effect or if this says something significant about planetary disk truncation in multiple star systems .    55 cnc ( hd 75732 ) , an extensive extrasolar system with four reported planets , has the widest projected planetary orbit with an a @xmath28 of 5.3 au .",
    "it is noteworthy that such an extensive exoplanet system also has a stellar companion , at a projected separation of 1050 au .",
    "this provides direct evidence of the stability of protoplanetary disks in multiple star systems such as to allow formation and sustenance of multiple planets , at least as long as the separation between the stars is sufficiently large .",
    "this system can also provide an observational constraint for evaluating theoretical models of disk stability and solar system evolution .",
    "the smallest projected separation for a stellar companion is 21 au for gj 86 , closely followed by 22 au for hd 41004 and @xmath0 cep .",
    "each system has only one reported planet , with a @xmath28 of 0.1 au , 1.3 au and 2.0 au , respectively .",
    "this may be evidence that a sufficiently close stellar companion will disrupt the protoplanetary disk , truncating planet formation at a few au from the primary .",
    "every exoplanet system so far discovered in a multiple star system has an s - type ( satellite - type ) orbit , where the planet orbits one of the stars .",
    "this is not surprising because current radial velocity searches for exoplanets exclude close binaries ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while the formation and stability of planets in p - type ( planet - type ) orbits , where a planet orbits the center - of - mass of a binary or multiple star system in a circumbinary configuration , has been theoretically demonstrated @xcite , it has not yet been observationally supported .",
    "however , @xcite have raised the interesting possibility that the 2.4 @xmath36  outer planet around hd 202206 may in - fact have formed in a circumbinary disk around the primary and the closer 17 @xmath36  minimum mass object .",
    "several studies have investigated the theoretical stability of planetary orbits in multiple star systems ( e.g. @xcite ) , deriving ratios of orbital semi - major axes of the planet and stellar companions for various values of mass - ratio and eccentricity of the stellar orbits .",
    "our work provides observational constraints based on all known exoplanets in multiple star systems .",
    "of the 30 confirmed exoplanets in multiple star systems , only three have a ratio of stellar to planetary projected separation of less than 100 .",
    "the lowest ratio is 11 , for @xmath0 cep ( hd 222404 ) .",
    "although numerical simulations demonstrate the stability of orbits for much smaller separation ratios ( e.g. for m@xmath43/(m@xmath44 + m@xmath43 ) = 0.5 and e = 0.1 , the minimum ratio of stellar and planetary orbital semi - major axes is about four from @xcite ) , no planets have yet been observed in this regime .",
    "this could be attributed to the selection effect of close binaries being excluded from planet searches , as described above .",
    "however , this could also provide evidence for protoplanetary disk truncation by a close stellar companion , preventing planet formation in systems with separation ratios close to the limits permitted by numerical simulations .",
    "eccentricities of exoplanet orbits are significantly higher than those of planets in our solar system @xcite . @xcite investigated whether the kozai mechanism can explain this entirely , and concluded that other effects are also at play .",
    "we investigated the potential impact of close stellar companions on the eccentricity of planetary orbits , as these would have a greater gravitational influence on the planet s orbit , and potentially reduce the period of kozai cycles .",
    "figure  [ eccrat ] shows the eccentricity of the planetary orbits as a function of the ratio of projected stellar separations to the a @xmath28 of planetary orbits , and does not conclusively demonstrate any relationship .",
    "however , even though three data points do not provide conclusive evidence , it is interesting to note that the systems with ratios under 100 have a minimum eccentricity of 0.2 , while larger ratio systems have lower eccentricities .",
    "we also looked at the relationship between period and eccentricity of planetary orbits in systems with and without stellar companions .",
    "figure  [ eccper ] shows the eccentricity of planetary orbits versus the orbital period .",
    "planet orbits in systems with confirmed stellar companions are represented by filled squares , orbits with candidate stellar companions are represented by open squares , and orbits in single star systems are denoted by open circles . @xcite and @xcite presented similar plots and concluded that all the planets with a period p @xmath45 40 days orbiting in multiple - star systems have an eccentricity smaller than 0.05 , whereas longer period planets found in multiple - star systems can have larger eccentricities .",
    "our updated results show that this conclusion is no longer strictly true .",
    "the latest planet reported around 55 cnc , designated with suffix e , has a period of 2.81 days and an eccentricity of 0.17 .",
    "also , we report hd 38529 as a multiple star system , which was assumed to be a single star system in @xcite .",
    "planet hd 38529b has a period of 14.31 days and an eccentricity of 0.29 .",
    "it appears that single - star and multiple - star planetary systems have similar period - eccentricity relationships .",
    "our comprehensive investigation of 131 exoplanet systems reveals that 30 ( 23% ) of these have stellar companions , an increase from 15 reported in previous such comprehensive efforts @xcite .",
    "we report new stellar companions to hd 38529 and hd 188015 , and identify a candidate companion to hd 169830 .",
    "our synthesis effort , bringing together disparate databases , recognizes , for the first time , five additional stellar companions to exoplanet hosts , including one triple system .",
    "a by - product of our cpm investigation is the determination that 20 of the wds entries for exoplanet hosts are not gravitationally bound to their `` primaries '' , but are chance alignments in the sky .",
    "some interesting examples in the inventory of multiple - star exoplanet systems include : ( 1 ) at least 3 and possibly 5 exoplanet systems are stellar triples ( see  [ sec : discussion ] ) ; ( 2 ) three systems ( gj 86 , hd 41004 , and @xmath0 cep ) have planets at @xmath1 mercury to mars distances and potentially close - in stellar companions at projected separations similar to the distance between the sun and uranus ( @xmath1 20 au ) ; ( 3 ) two systems ( gj 86 and hd 147513 ) have white dwarf companions .",
    "these results show that planets form and survive in a variety of stellar multiplicity environments .",
    "we hope that this compendium of stellar multiples in exoplanet systems will provide a valuable benchmark for future companion searches and exoplanet system analyses .",
    "we wish to thank charlie finch and jennifer winters for their supporting work in this effort .",
    "we also thank g. fritz benedict and jacob bean for obtaining and reducing the radial velocity data for hd 38529b .",

    "<S> we present results of a reconnaissance for stellar companions to all 131 radial - velocity - detected candidate extrasolar planetary systems known as of july 1 , 2005 . </S>",
    "<S> common proper motion companions were investigated using the multi - epoch stsci digitized sky surveys , and confirmed by matching the trigonometric parallax distances of the primaries to companion distances estimated photometrically . </S>",
    "<S> we also attempt to confirm or refute companions listed in the washington double star catalog , the catalogs of nearby stars series by gliese and jahrei , in hipparcos results , and in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our findings indicate that a lower limit of 30 ( 23% ) of the 131 exoplanet systems have stellar companions . </S>",
    "<S> we report new stellar companions to hd 38529 and hd 188015 , and a new candidate companion to hd 169830 . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm many previously reported stellar companions , including six stars in five systems , that are recognized for the first time as companions to exoplanet hosts . we have found evidence that 20 entries in the washington double star catalog are not gravitationally bound companions . at least three ( hd 178911 , 16 cyg b , and hd 219449 ) , and possibly five ( including hd 41004 and hd 38529 ) , of the exoplanet systems reside in triple star systems . </S>",
    "<S> three exoplanet systems ( gj 86 , hd 41004 , and @xmath0 cep ) have potentially close - in stellar companions , with planets at @xmath1 mercury to mars distances from the host star and stellar companions at projected separations of @xmath1 20 au , similar to the sun  uranus distance . finally , two of the exoplanet systems contain white dwarf companions . </S>",
    "<S> this comprehensive assessment of exoplanet systems indicates that solar systems are found in a variety of stellar multiplicity environments  singles , binaries , and triples ; and that planets survive the post - main - sequence evolution of companion stars . </S>"
