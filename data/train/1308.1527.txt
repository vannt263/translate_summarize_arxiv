    "quantum mechanical ( qm ) calculations of molecular reaction dynamics @xcite are generally much heavier than quasi - classical trajectory calculations @xcite , in particular for polyatomic processes @xcite .",
    "hence , for several decades , intense researches aim at building semiclassical methods taking into account the largest quantum effects while keeping with the classical description of nuclear motions @xcite .",
    "moreover , developping such methods naturally leads to shed light on the complex frontier between the quantum and classical descriptions of motion .",
    "last but not least , semiclassical approaches may be used as powerful interpretative tools to rationalize the dynamics of molecular processes .",
    "the semiclassical wigner treatment of bimolecular collisions proposed by lee and scully is among them @xcite . when applied to the collinear inelastic collision between he and h@xmath0 , or he and hbr , which involve strong quantum interferences and/or classically forbidden vibrational transitions , this approach leads to final state populations in very good agreement with exact quantum ones ( at least for the lowest vibrational states of the initial diatom ) , contrary to the quasi - classical trajectory ( qct ) method @xcite .",

    "[ fig:1 ] and  [ fig:2 ] for he plus h@xmath0 ( note that these results are particularly relevant as comparative semiclassical / quantum studies of collinear processes usually provide more stringent tests of the validity of semiclassical approaches than similar studies for realistic three - dimensional collisions ) .",
    "in addition , the treatment of lee and scully is particularly simple to apply .",
    "hence , it is potentially interesting to study realistic molecular collisions involving certain quantum effects ( other than tunneling though a potential energy barrier ) .",
    "however , the original derivation of this treatment @xcite appears to rest on somewhat arbitrary basis , as shown later below .",
    "the goal of the present work is thus to put this treatment on firmer theoretical grounds by deriving it from first principles .",
    "this work is mainly motivated by the recent extention of the semiclassical wigner treatment of heller @xcite to triatomic ( or triatomic - like polyatomic ) photodissociations @xcite .",
    "for the first time , rotational motions were taken into account in the theory , thus making it applicable to realistic fragmentations , and comparison between its predictions and rigorous quantum results in the case of guo s triatomic - like model of methyl iodide photodissociation @xcite showed nearly quantitative agreement .",
    "since the method of lee and scully bears strong resemblance with the one of brown and heller , we hope to be able in the future to include rotational motions in the former so as to make it applicable to realistic bimolecular processes .",

    ", the norm seems to be systematically more underestimated by the lee - scully expression than by the forward - scw one .",
    "though the differences between the two sets of results are very small , they nevertheless support the idea that the lee - scully expression is an approximation to the forward - scw expression ( though an excellent one ) .",
