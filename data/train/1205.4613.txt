    "the energy that heats the solar corona and accelerates the solar wind originates in convective motions beneath the sun s surface .",
    "however , even after many years of investigation , the physical processes that transport a fraction of this energy to the corona and convert it into thermal , magnetic , and kinetic energy are still not understood . in order to construct and test theoretical models , a wide range of measurements of relevant plasma parameters must be available . in the low - density , open - field regions that reach into interplanetary space ,",
    "the number of plasma parameters that need to be measured is larger because the plasma becomes collisionless and individual particle species ( e.g. , protons , electrons , and heavy ions ) can exhibit divergent properties .",
    "such differences in particle velocity distributions are valuable probes of kinetic processes of heating and acceleration .    the spectroscopic instruments aboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _",

    "the ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer ( uvcs ) and solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ( sumer)have measured several key collisionless plasma properties for a variety of solar wind source regions @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the high - speed solar wind , both coronal and heliospheric measurements point to the existence of preferential ion heating and acceleration , as well as protons being hotter than electrons",
    ". there are also marked departures from maxwellian velocity distributions for protons and other ions , with the temperature measured in directions perpendicular to the background magnetic field often exceeding the temperature parallel to the field ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) .    a large number of different processes have been suggested to explain the measured proton and ion properties .",
    "many of these processes are related to the dissipation of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves , and many involve multiple steps of energy conversion between waves , reconnection structures , and other nonlinear plasma features .",
    "it was noticed several decades ago that the damping of ion cyclotron resonant alfvn waves could naturally give rise to many of the observed plasma properties ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the problem in the solar corona , though , is how these extremely high - frequency ( @xmath1@xmath2 hz ) waves could be generated from pre - existing mhd fluctuations that appear to have much lower frequencies ( @xmath3 hz ) .",
    "one likely source of high - frequency waves and kinetic dissipation is an mhd turbulent cascade .",

    "the general scenario is that convection jostles open magnetic flux tubes that are rooted in the photosphere and produces alfvn waves that propagate into the corona .",
    "these waves undergo partial reflection , and the resulting `` colliding wave packets '' drive a turbulent cascade which heats the plasma when the eddies reach small enough spatial scales .    it has been known for many years that alfvnic turbulence in a strong magnetic field produces a cascade to small scales mainly in the two - dimensional plane perpendicular to the field @xcite , and thus is _ not _ likely to produce high - frequency ion cyclotron waves . in other words , mhd turbulence leads to eddies with large perpendicular wavenumbers @xmath4 and not large parallel wavenumbers @xmath5 . under typical plasma conditions in the corona and inner heliosphere ,",
    "the linear dissipation of high-@xmath4 alfvn waves would lead to the preferential parallel heating of electrons @xcite .",
    "this apparently disagrees with the observational evidence for perpendicular heating of positive ions .",
    "there have been several proposed solutions to the apparent incompatibility between the predictions of mhd turbulence and existing measurements ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "for example , turbulent fluctuations may be susceptible to various instabilities that cause ion cyclotron waves to grow @xcite or they may induce stochastic perpendicular motions in ions if they reach nonlinear magnitudes @xcite .",

    "the most direct solution to the problem still appears to be for turbulence to transport some fraction of the fluctuation energy to high-@xmath5 cyclotron resonant waves .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate the idea proposed by @xcite for the turbulent generation of ion cyclotron waves . in this scenario ,",
    "nonlinear couplings between alfvn waves and other modes such as fast magnetosonic waves produce an enhancement in the high-@xmath5 power - law tail of the alfvnic fluctuation spectrum .",
    "this is made possible by the ability of fast - mode waves to cascade nearly isotropically in wavenumber space .",

    "we discuss the likelihood of rapid coupling between the high - wavenumber tails of the alfvn and fast - mode power spectra .",

    "unfortunately , the vast majority of these measurements have been made for the slow solar wind and not the much less structured fast wind associated with polar coronal holes .",
    "nearer to the sun , @xcite used the dispersive and energy partition properties of thin - tube mhd waves to diagnose the presence and strengths of various modes in active regions .",
    "these techniques may be useful in open - field regions as well .",

    "thus , the choice of the lower boundary condition on @xmath100 can have a significant impact on the radial evolution of all three wave types .",

    "the integrated energy densities are plotted in velocity units as @xmath162 .",
    "the power in the alfvn waves changes by only a small amount because the damping is never a strong contributor to the @xmath60 transport equation .",
    "however , damping is a major effect for the fast and slow modes , and thus small changes in the damping rate s normalization can have large relative impacts on the resulting energy densities .",
    "figure [ fig04 ] shows that , no matter the choice of normalization for @xmath100 , it seems unlikely for the slow - mode waves to have significantly large amplitudes anywhere but in the lowest few tenths of a solar radius .",
    "this appears to be consistent with models of slow - mode shock formation and dissipation in polar plumes @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the remainder of this paper , our models of turbulence in the fast solar wind _ ignore the slow - mode waves altogether .",
    "_ we also note that figure [ fig04 ] suggests that the actual fast - mode wave properties in the high - speed solar wind may be more highly variable than the alfvn wave properties .",
    "our use of a `` standard '' model for the fast - mode waves ( using the parameters given in table [ table01 ] ) is thus presented as an example case and not a definitive prediction .",
    "in this section we begin constructing a model of the wavenumber distribution of alfvn and fast - mode fluctuation power at each radial distance . we make use of a general assumption of `` scale separation ; ''",
    "i.e. , we presume that the turbulence becomes fully developed on timescales short compared to the bulk solar wind outflow and the large - scale expansion of open flux tubes .",
    "this allows us to model the turbulence as spatially homogeneous in a small volume element with constant background plasma properties .",

    "figure [ fig16 ] shows the results of mode coupling between the alfvn and fast - mode fluctuations .",
    "the curves in figure [ fig16](a ) were computed for a range of constant values of the coupling constant @xmath299 from @xmath335 to @xmath336 . at large distances ( @xmath425 au ) , it is clear that the presence or absence of coupling has very little effect on the @xmath410 ratio .",
    "this insensitivity occurs because much of the proton heating at intermediate and high values of @xmath38 comes from the landau and transit - time damping of kaws . the low - k@xmath426 , high-@xmath4 part of the @xmath172 spectrum is there no matter the value of @xmath299 , and it dominates the proton and electron heating in this case .",
    "the results are similar to those of @xcite who did not include mode coupling",
    ".    in the low-@xmath38 corona , figure [ fig16 ] indicates that @xmath299 needs to be at least of order unity to excite sufficient power in high-@xmath5 ion cyclotron waves to heat protons on par with the electrons ( i.e. , @xmath427 ) . for low values of @xmath299 ,",
    "the plotted ratio undergoes several increases and decreases as a function of radius that we can not trace to any one simple cause .",
    "the local maximum that appears at @xmath428 corresponds to the local minimum in plasma @xmath38 ( see figure [ fig01 ] ) . in the low-@xmath38 regime , it is likely that the relative `` competition '' between mode coupling , transit - time damping ( for @xmath276 ) , and ion cyclotron damping ( for @xmath172 ) undergoes numerous reversals as a function of radius .    in figure [ fig16](b )",
    "we fix the coupling constant at @xmath344 , which is of the same order of magnitude as predicted by @xcite , and we vary the normalization of the fast - mode wave power .",
    "it was evident from figure [ fig04 ] that small changes in the large - scale wave transport properties could give rise to large changes in the fast - mode power in much of the corona and solar wind .",
    "thus , we take the standard model for @xmath429 and multiply it by constant factors ranging from @xmath352 to @xmath430 .",
    "we note , however , that we do not have excessive freedom to increase the @xmath92 normalization too far above the standard model . a significantly higher coronal population of fast - mode waves would contribute to a larger @xmath146 that may exceed the observational constraints shown in figure [ fig03](a ) .",
    "nonetheless , figure [ fig16](b ) shows that the standard model ends up being a reasonable solution that matches the observed in  situ heating ratio @xcite and also gives appreciable proton heating in the extended corona ( as required qualitatively from uvcs proton temperature measurements ) ; see @xcite .",
    "an example calculation of preferential heavy ion heating is shown in figure [ fig17 ] .",
    "the ion used for the model was o@xmath431 , whose properties have been measured in the corona from emission in the 1032 , 1037  spectral line doublet @xcite .",
    "we used the parameters corresponding to the best agreement with observational constraints on @xmath410 ( see table [ table02 ] ) .",
    "we then adjusted the fast - mode wave power @xmath429 by changing the multiplicative constant that was varied in figure [ fig16](b ) .",
    "as in figure [ fig16](b ) , values of this multiplicative constant between about 1 and 10 appear to bracket the observational constraints .",
    "the plotted ranges for the observationally determined @xmath432 rates were derived by combining observations from both the uvcs @xcite and sumer @xcite instruments on _ soho _ with semi - empirical solutions of the perpendicular internal energy conservation equations .",
    "these heating rates were not given explicitly by either @xcite or @xcite , but they were computed and saved from the models that produced agreement with the observed radial behavior of @xmath433 .",
    "the sumer and uvcs data were obtained for off - limb measurements of emission , in which the line widths are primary diagnostics of @xmath433 . note that the radial dependence of the two observationally determined regions is similar to that in the plotted model curves .",
    "however , the sumer data corresponds to about a factor of 10 higher fast - mode wave power normalization than the uvcs data .",
    "if the postulated mode - coupling explanation for ion cyclotron proton / ion heating is correct , then the results given in figures [ fig16 ] and [ fig17 ] constrain the required levels of fast - mode wave power . in the low corona ( @xmath152 ) , there may need to be up to a factor of 10 higher value of @xmath92 than in the standard model of section [ sec : global ] , but in the extended corona and heliosphere the standard model may be close to correct . of course , it is only the high-@xmath5 tail of the fast - mode spectrum that matters to the calculation of available alfvnic power at the ion cyclotron resonances , not its outer - scale normalization . therefore it is possible that @xmath92 may depart significantly from the values predicted by the standard model of section [ sec : global ] , but still produce agreement with the various observations by having different values for the spectral slope and angle - dependence of @xmath434 .",
    "the aim of this paper was to explore the consequences of @xcite s ( @xcite ) conjecture that nonlinear couplings between alfvn and fast - mode waves may produce sufficient ion cyclotron wave power to heat protons and heavy ions in the corona .",
    "to test this idea , we constructed a semi - empirical model of the background plasma and mhd wave properties in a flux tube connected to a polar coronal hole .",
    "for the sake of practicality , we utilized several approximations when solving the wave energy transport equations for the energy densities of alfvn , fast , and slow modes :    1 .",
    "the equations themselves were adapted from standard wkb `` wave action conservation '' theory , which does not take account of the effects of linear wave reflection in a fully self - consistent manner .",
    "we also assumed the associated wkb limiting case of equipartition between the kinetic and magnetic energy densities for the dominant alfvn waves ( i.e. , @xmath435 ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "these approximations are consistent with an assumption that the wave frequencies are higher than @xmath436 hz in the corona .",
    "however , it has also been shown that the radial behavior of alfvnic wave power in the solar wind is never far from the predictions of wkb theory even in the heliosphere where reflection is not negligible @xcite .",
    "because of other evidence that the dominant inertial - frame frequencies in coronal mhd turbulence may be lower than @xmath437 hz ( see , e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we made use of a low - frequency approximation for the alfvn wave reflection coefficient @xmath112 .",
    "this also involved an analytic approximation for the radial dependence of the alfvn speed scale height @xmath120 ( equation ( [ eq : tref ] ) ) .",
    "3 .   for the fast and slow magnetosonic waves , we modeled the radial transport of an isotropic ensemble of propagation directions @xmath46 using a single wave action conservation equation .",
    "we chose one reasonable method to perform the averages over @xmath46 , but other methods may yield different results .",
    "we also used the eulerian average for the outflow speed @xmath11 and neglected the second - order effects of `` stokes drift '' that would enter into the associated lagrangian version of the mean ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although the effects of removing these approximations should be investigated further , we do not believe their use invalidates the results of the wave transport models presented above .    with the above caveats taken into account",
    ", we produced a standard model of the alfvn , fast , and slow mode energy densities between 0.01 and 1000 @xmath6 above the solar photosphere . in agreement with earlier results",
    ", we found that slow - mode mhd waves of solar origin probably can not survive into the extended corona .",
    "in addition , we found that the amplitudes of fast - mode waves at large distances are more sensitive to the assumed model parameters than are the amplitudes of alfvn waves .",
    "for this reason the standard model of fast - mode wave energy density was treated as a representative example and not a definitive prediction .",
    "thus , other reasonable models of the available fast - mode power can be obtained by multiplying or dividing the standard model s energy density by factors of order 10100 without sacrificing too much realism .    at each radial distance , we simulated the time - steady wavenumber power spectra of alfvnic and fast - mode turbulent fluctuations .",
    "we included the effects of nonlinear coupling and collisionless kinetic wave dissipation .",
    "we also computed the time - steady heating rates for protons , electrons , and a representative minor ion species ( o@xmath431 ) for comparison with observational constraints .",
    "the resulting heating rates for the standard model of fast - mode wave power was found to provide both substantial heating for coronal protons as well as produce agreement with the preferential o@xmath431 ion heating measured by uvcs/_soho_. however , if the fast - mode wave power in the corona is significantly _ lower _ than was assumed in the standard model , the proposed idea of mode coupling is probably not a viable mechanism for the ion heating .    in order to match some of the observations  such as the need for @xmath410 to be of order unity at @xmath152 and for the o@xmath431 heating rate to agree with that measured by sumer/_soho _ at similar heights  we found that approximately 10 times the standard model s assumed fast - mode wave energy density may need to be present .",
    "this could be accounted for in several ways .",
    "first , we neglected the effects of alfvn waves giving rise to second order fluctuations that mimic the properties of both fast and slow magnetosonic waves @xcite .",
    "it is possible that these secondary oscillations could behave similarly enough to ideal fast - mode waves that they enable the same kinds of cascade and coupling .",
    "second , we also neglected nonlinear couplings that involve slow - mode mhd waves , which appear to dominate the density fluctuations in the low corona .",
    "it may be possible for these couplings ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to also power the high-@xmath5 part of the alfvnic fluctuation spectrum .    to make further progress with the proposed set of ideas",
    ", it will be important to better understand the origin of the fast , slow , and alfvn waves in the solar photosphere and chromosphere .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and others studied the wavelike oscillations induced by convective jostling in small - scale flux tubes that extend up into the chromosphere .",
    "however , once waves reach the sharp and `` corrugated '' tr boundary , they can undergo reflection , refraction , and multiple types of mode conversion @xcite .",
    "the types and strengths of mhd waves that survive the chaotic lower atmosphere probably also depend on the nature of the region underlying the solar wind flux tubes of interest ( i.e. , coronal hole , active region , or quiet loops ) .",
    "future work must also involve more physical realism for the model of turbulent cascade .",
    "replacing our hodge - podge collection of analytic solutions with a fully self - consistent numerical simulation is an obvious priority . a key part of this improvement will be to remove the assumption of scale separation that prevents different radial zones from interacting with one another in wavenumber space ( see , e.g. , *",
    "in addition , we note that the advection - diffusion terms in equations ( [ eq : difeqa])([eq : difeqf ] ) contain the limiting assumption that the spectral transfer is `` local '' in @xmath47-space .",
    "it has been shown that true mhd turbulence is not so local because of intermittent high - order wave - wave interactions and nonlinear steepening effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also assumed energy equipartition between the @xmath146 and @xmath186 spectra in the mhd inertial range , but in  situ measurements show that not to be the case in actual solar wind turbulence @xcite .",
    "we also intend to improve upon the kinetic treatment of collisionless particle heating described in section [ sec : disp ] .",
    "we assumed isotropic maxwellian velocity distributions when solving for the linear damping rates , but @xcite showed how non - maxwellian temperature anisotropies can significantly affect the kaw dispersion relation .",
    "the ultimate rate of electron heating from kaw landau damping can also be affected by nonlinearity and coulomb collision effects that we did not include ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the time evolution of proton and ion velocity distributions , under the influence of cyclotron resonant heating , is also decidedly non - maxwellian @xcite .",
    "finally , we emphasize that the proposed idea of nonlinear coupling between alfvn and fast - mode waves is only one proposed solution to the problem of preferential proton / ion heating .",
    "some of the other suggested explanations were listed briefly in section [ sec : intro ] .",
    "one recent example that has received significant attention is the stochastic energization of protons and ions that occurs when kaw amplitudes become sufficiently high @xcite . to excite this proposed stochasticity , the dimensionless ratio @xmath438 ( evaluated at @xmath439 )",
    "should exceed values of order 0.1 .",
    "however , in this paper s standard model of alfvnic fluctuations ( either with or without nonlinear couplings ) , this ratio never exceeds a value of 0.003 .",
    "the main factor responsible for this dramatic mismatch is our assumption of the @xcite scaling in the limit of strong turbulence ( i.e. , @xmath440 ) .",
    "alternate theories of the strong alfvnic cascade ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) give a shallower dependence of @xmath441 .",

    "@xcite derived an analytic solution to a simplified version of equation ( [ eq : difeqa ] ) , with @xmath556 and @xmath557 these expressions are appropriate for the mhd inertial range where @xmath440 , but we use them for the entire range of modeled wavenumbers .",

    "this has the effect of extending the `` filled '' region of the spectrum ( i.e. , @xmath568 ) up through all wavenumbers with @xmath569 .    finally , we must adjust the highest frequency part of the spectrum to account self - consistently for the effects of ion cyclotron damping . because the cyclotron resonance at high @xmath5 has a rapid onset ( see figure [ fig11](a ) ) , we need only model its effects over a limited range of wavenumber space . we truncate the calculation of the spectrum at a maximum parallel wavenumber @xmath570 at which @xmath571 . above this wavenumber",

    "this solution gives rise to a significant reduction in the power spectrum when the damping rate @xmath102 exceeds the rate at which power is supplied from the nonlinear coupling .",

    "this can be done by using the time - steady inertial range scaling for @xmath309 , with @xmath592 note that equation ( 8) of @xcite gave the same result for the fast - mode cascade timescale ( but without the @xmath215 term ) .",
    "the normalization wavenumber @xmath593 is defined arbitrarily here ; it needs to be set well below the regime of strong damping , but well above the outer - scale wavenumber @xmath238 so that we can justify ignoring the source term .",
    "the above approximation gives @xmath594 .",
    "it is also straightforward to model the fast - mode damping rate as being proportional to a constant power of the wavenumber , and thus we assume @xmath595 .",
