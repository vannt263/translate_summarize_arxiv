    "it is known for a long time that excitation spectrum in underdoped high @xmath3 cuprates shows formation of the pseudogap at temperature @xmath4 far above @xmath5 ; this phenomena was observed in the nmr responses @xcite and in optics @xcite .",
    "recently the photoemission experiments showed that this phenomena can be attributed to the electrons in the corners of the fermi surface which acquire a gap in these materials at about the same temperature at which pseudogap is observed in optics and nmr @xcite .",
    "below @xmath5 the value of the gap does not change significantly with temperature , instead the electron spectral function develops coherence peaks at the gap edges .",
    "these data invite the interpretation that this gap formation is due to the pairing of electrons in the corners of the fermi surface into the bosons which later bose condense at @xmath5 .",
    "the description of the superconductivity in the cuprates as a bose condensation of preformed pairs was proposed also in different physical contexts @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all these scenarios would lead to the conclusion that superconducting transition is similar to the bose condensation and has a wide fluctuation region near @xmath3 .",
    "this conclusion does not agree with the data which show that the transition is more mean field like and that it is characterized by a small value of ginzburg parameter . in this paper",
    "we show that the bose condensation description and mean - field nature of the superconducting transition can be reconciled if bose condensation happens against the background of the fermi liquid and processes that convert bosons into the fermions on the fermi surface are allowed .",
    "we formulate the model which describes this physics in section ii and derive its physical properties in section iii .",
    "another problem of the descriptions based on bose condensation is that it leads to a large value of the hall effect in the superconducting state .",
    "our analysis of the data shows that usual bose condensation is not consistent with the data whereas bose condensation which happens against the background of the fermi liquid might be consistent with the available hall data in the underdoped @xmath1 materials but is not consistent with the data on optimally doped @xmath1 or underdoped @xmath2 .",
    "we emphasize however that the data presentlly available are not sufficient to make the definite conclusion , especially for the underdoped materials ; we discuss the data in more detail below in the introduction and in section iv .",
    "it is not important for the foregoing discussion what is the microscopic mechanism resulting in the formation of the preformed pairs but for the sake of concreteness we shall discuss the model where these pairs are formed from the electrons in the corners of the fermi surface .",
    "qualitatively , the relative weakness of superconducting fluctuations in high @xmath0 is clear from the following arguments . in these highly anisotropic materials",
    "the coherence length in @xmath6-direction , @xmath7 , is much smaller than the interlayer distance , @xmath8 making them almost two dimensional superconductors . in a purely two dimensional superconductor bose condensation would show up as berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition in which the superfluid density jumps from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "weak three dimensional effects would only smear this transition a little .",
    "such @xmath11 dependence was not observed in any cuprates ; instead the observed temperature dependence of @xmath12 is mean field like in the broad temperature range even for underdoped cuprates , for instance in @xmath13 @xmath14 for @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "note here that critical three dimensional behavior of optimally doped @xmath16 reported in @xcite does not contradict the conclusion that superconducting fluctuations are relatively weak . in this material",
    "the @xmath11 dependence remains linear in @xmath17 in a wide temperature range @xcite and the mere fact that these critical fluctuations are three dimensional implies that they occur only in the vicinity of @xmath0 where the correlation length in @xmath6 direction becomes large , @xmath18 .",
    "quantitatively , the strength of superconducting fluctuations in quasi two dimensional systems is determined by the superfluid density , @xmath19 .",
    "the measured absolute values of @xmath19 in cuprates turn out to be too large for the bose condensation scenario ; in @xmath13 the in - plane penetration lengths are @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite . such penetration length would lead to the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature @xmath22 ( here and below we assume that the individual planes constituting bilayers are strongly coupled so our estimates differ by a factor of 2 from the estimates in @xcite ) .",
    "this unrealistic value indicates that @xmath12 must decrease by a factor of @xmath23 before the thermal fluctuations become important in agreement with linear @xmath12 dependence observed in @xcite . a related evidence of the weakness of superconducting fluctuations is provided by a small value of the ginzburg parameter which is @xmath24 in this material ( see eq .",
    "( [ gi ] ) ) .    another important argument against bose condensation",
    "is provided by the hall effect data near @xmath0 .",
    "bose condensation of charged particles would lead to a huge hall effect in the superconducting state : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is density of bosons and a large fluctuational contribution to the hall effect above @xmath0 .",
    "the existing data on the underdoped materials show that the hall effect in the flux flow regime is large , but not as huge as follows from the bose condensation model .",
    "specifically , in @xmath27 material we extrapolate the data obtained in the flux flow regime at @xmath28 @xcite to zero temperature value @xmath29}\\frac{1}{\\omega cm}$ ] ; this corresponds to the effective boson density @xmath30 per in - plane copper atom which is too small .",
    "a similar explanation of the pseudogap phenomena is based on the spin charge separation model @xcite . in this model",
    "the gap formation is due to the pairing of spinons which carry no charge , such pairing does not lead to superconductivity ; it happens only at lower temperature and is due to bose condensation of holons .",
    "this model has the same difficulty as the condensation of the preformed pairs discussed above ; there seems to be no reason to expect a narrow fluctuation region if the transition is driven by the bose condensation of holons .    a somewhat different view point on this problem",
    "is provided by the models which interpolate between bcs like transition in fermi liquid and ordinary bose condensation of preformed pairs as the interaction strength is varied @xcite . in this framework the data discussed above would make one to conclude that high @xmath0 cuprates are well inside the fermi liquid regime and very far from the preformed pairs in contradiction to the observed gap formation above @xmath0 in underdoped cuprates .",
    "another puzzling property of the superconducting transition is the change of the hall effect sign occurring below @xmath5 .",
    "this sign change is preempted by the negative fluctuational contribution to the positive hall effect in the normal state @xcite ; qualitatively both the sign change in the superconducting phase and the fluctuational hall effect can be explained if cooper pairs which are responsible for superconductivity are in fact negatively charged . in this case",
    "these pairs give a large negative contribution to the hall conductivity in the vortex state below @xmath31which is proportional to @xmath32 ; and produce negative fluctuational hall conductivity observed in @xcite . both hall conductivity in the vortex state near @xmath5 and the fluctuational conductivity above it",
    "can be described in the framework of the time dependent ginzburg landau ( tdgl ) equation ; for this equation the negative sign of the cooper pair implies that the imaginary part of the relaxation rate @xmath33    @xmath34    here @xmath35 is the usual ginzburg - landau free energy @xcite .    in the framework of the usual bcs theory the sign and the magnitude of @xmath36 ( and therefore the effective charge of the cooper pair )",
    "is determined by the derivative of the density of states at the fermi surface , @xmath37 , namely @xmath38 .",
    "this conclusion remains valid for any weak coupling bcs  theory of superconductivity regardless of the nature of the interaction @xcite .",
    "for the high @xmath5 cuprates @xmath39 is controlled by the proximity to a van hove singularity and photoemission data show that fermi surface is always a hole like , so that @xmath40 and bcs theory would predict the hole sign of @xmath36 in contrast to the data .",
    "one can also relate @xmath41 to @xmath42 and avoid the use of photoemission data , this would lead to the prediction @xmath43 which implies that the hydrodynamic contribution to the hall effect is hole - like for the underdoped cuprates and electron - like for the overdoped cuprates in a striking contrast to the study of @xmath44 @xcite which reported the opposite correlation .",
    "we emphasize here that the sign change of the hall effect in the superconducting state does not itself contradicts the bcs theory , it is only the disagreement between the sign of @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) and the sign of the hydrodynamic contribution to the hall effect which indicates that the weak coupling bcs theory is not valid . in conventional , bcs - like superconductors , the hall effect might change sign if @xmath45 has the sign opposite to the sign of the charge carriers which is measured by the normal state hall effect .",
    "the sign of the charge carriers in the normal state is determined by the topology of the fermi surface .",
    "the sign change might occur if @xmath40 on the electron - like fermi surface or if @xmath46 on the hole - like fermi surface .",
    "qualitatively , the notion of electron - like preformed pairs agrees with the non - bcs behavior of the hall effect of the superconductive pairs , but it is difficult to reconcile both of them with the small value of the ginzburg parameter and with a moderate hall effect in the superconducting state . in this paper",
    "we resolve this dichotomy suggesting the model where preformed pairs coexist with usual fermions and show that in such systems the hall effect might still be unusual but the ginzburg parameter is small .",
    "one can justify this model using the following qualitative arguments .     the fermi line shown here",
    "was obtained in the tight binding model with diagonal hopping @xmath47 ; it is similar to the fermi line observed in the underdoped @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the shaded discs denote the part of the momentum space where a pseudogap was observed in the experiment .",
    "we shall assume that the fermions in these regions are paired into the bosons .",
    "it is well established that cuprate fermi surface lies in the vicinity of the van hove points .",
    "moreover , it is remarkable how small is dispersion of fermions near @xmath49 points in the underdoped cuprates according to the photoemission data @xcite .",
    "it is natural to assume that interaction between these fermions can easily exceed their kinetic energy and that the interaction with momentum transfer @xmath50 is less repulsive than interaction with small momentum transfer .",
    "such interaction gives fermions a gap which is due to the pairing in the antiferromagnetic or superconducting channels . in the weak coupling approximation the d - wave superconductive pairing dominates if the fermi surface is not nested . in the cuprates both photoemission data @xcite and band structure calculations @xcite show that the fermi surface is not nested ; a simplest fermi surface which agrees with photoemission data shown in fig .",
    "1 . therefore",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that fermions near the corners of the fermi surface ( which lie inside the discs shown in fig . 1 )",
    "are paired into bosons , @xmath51 , with charge @xmath52 and no dispersion ; this is the key assumption of our model .",
    "so one - particle fermionic excitations acquire a gap ; the soft modes appearing instead of these fermionic excitations are spinless bosons @xmath53 where @xmath54 is phenomenological parameter of the model .",
    "note that in this model the bose condensation does not occur because bosons have no dispersion ( i.e. are infinitely heavy ) .",
    "another assumption of the model is that interaction , @xmath55 , transferring electrons from the discs , where they are paired to the other parts of the fermi surface ( where fermi velocity is large ) is weak .",
    "this assumption can be justified in the spinon - holon model of charge separation @xcite where this interaction is suppressed by gauge field fluctuations .",
    "if @xmath55 is small we may neglect the effects of these transfer processes on the gap formation in the corners of the fermi surface , clearly in this case the gap formation in the corners does not necessarily result in the superconductivity and it does not give a gap to the electrons away from the discs. at higher temperatures the effects of the remaining fermions can be neglected and bosons form a normal liquid without long range order . only at sufficiently low temperatures the boson - mediated cooper pairing between remaining unpaired electrons results in the superconductivity .",
    "hamiltonian describing this physics is @xmath56 here @xmath57 denotes the sum over brillouin zone excluding the disc area .    because @xmath58 describes fermions paired into the state with @xmath8-wave symmetry , @xmath59 also has this symmetry and we may approximate it by @xmath60 and neglect its @xmath61-dependence at small @xmath61 .",
    "superconducting transition in this model occurs at @xmath5 given by @xmath62 where integral @xmath63 is taken over the fermi line and @xmath64 is upper cut off .",
    "depending on the parameter @xmath65 model ( [ h ] ) describes somewhat different physical situations . at @xmath66",
    "even at low temperatures bosons exist only as virtual states , in this case the superconducting transition is almost conventional . at @xmath67",
    "the density of bosons at @xmath68 is significant so the superconducting transition acquires some features of the bose condensation .",
    "we anticipate that the former case is relevant for optimally doped cuprates whereas the latter is more appropriate for the underdoped ones .",
    "model ( [ h ] ) is somewhat similar to the model of disordered quasilocalized pairs coexisting with fermi liquid introduced in @xcite ; in the latter model the quasilocalized pairs are assumed to form resonances with energies @xmath69 that are randomly distributed around the fermi level .",
    "we do not know any experimental justification for this assumption and we believe that the phase transition in the presence of such large disorder in the energy levels will become quite broad .    the superconducting transition at @xmath5 can be described as a bose condensation which occurs only because bosons become coherent due to the exchange of fermions .",
    "alternatively , one might integrate out the bosons and get the fermion model with retarded short - range interaction .",
    "both approaches lead to the same physical results . here",
    "we shall adopt the bose formalism because it is shorter and more physical in the regime when @xmath70 so the density of bosons is significant ; we shall argue below that this regime is relevant for the underdoped cuprates . at @xmath0",
    "the gap begins to open on the remaining part of the fermi surface @xmath71 clearly @xmath72 plays the role of the order parameter in this model ; its thermal fluctuations are governed by the action @xmath73 which is obtained after integrating out the fermion degrees of freedom : @xmath74 \\right\\ } \\phi_\\omega - \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\int \\left| \\phi_t \\right| ^{4 } dt .",
    "\\label{s(phi)}\\ ] ] here we use imaginary time representation ; we introduce coefficients @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the latter we introduced to facilitate the comparison with the usual time dependent ginzburg - landau equation where this coefficient is determined by a particle - hole asymmetry near the fermi surface and is usually small . generally , the coefficient @xmath77 has contributions from the bare action of the bosons , @xmath78 , described by hamiltonian ( [ h_b ] ) and from the fermions that we integrated out but the latter is always small in parameter @xmath79 leading to a simple result , @xmath80 .",
    "action of a generic form ( [ s(phi ) ] ) but with different parameter values describes also usual bcs type superconductivity in the fermi liquid , bose condesation and interpolation between these two regimes @xcite .",
    "the crucial difference between the interpolation scheme @xcite and model considered here is that the latter leads to such parameters that the condesate amplitude , @xmath81 , always remains small even far from @xmath0 and so the the fluctuation region is narrow and the hall effect never becomes too large .",
    "the gradient term in the effective action ( [ s(phi ) ] ) is determined by the fermion properties . as a result",
    "the superconducting transition is mean field like and thermal fluctuations become large only in the narrow vicinity , @xmath82 , of the transition temperature ; it is convenient to express it in terms of the screening length , @xmath83 @xmath82 is given by @xmath84 here we define @xmath83 as the value of the physical screening length interpolated from the vicinity of the transition temperature to low temperatures ; it is expressed through the coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 of the effective action ( [ s(phi ) ] ) by @xmath87 we computed the coefficient @xmath85 and @xmath88 for the fermions with the spectrum @xmath89 . because fermions in the discs of size @xmath90 around van hove points are paired and do not contribute to the effective action we excluded these regions from the integrals over the fermi surface ( [ xi_0 ] )",
    "we get @xmath91 here @xmath92 is dimensionless function of the doping density @xmath93 which we plot in fig . 2 for @xmath94 and different sizes of the excluded regions ,",
    "@xmath95 we observe that once the regions near the corners of the fermi surface are excluded the doping dependence of the penetration length becomes relatively weak and the dependance on the size of the excluded regions become far more important .",
    "qualitatively we expect that the size of the excluded region becomes large in the underdoped bilayered cuprates where large pseudogap was observed in spin responses and photoemission so that their penetration length is larger than the one in the optimally doped cuprates in agreement with the data .",
    "however we can not make a quantitative comparison because we do not know the value of @xmath96 .     controlling the penetration depth @xmath97 as a function of doping assuming that other parameters are constants for different `` disc '' sizes @xmath98 where pseudogap is formed .",
    "dotted line corresponds to @xmath99 , dashed line was obtained for @xmath100 and full line for @xmath101 .",
    "the results above do not depend on the dynamical part of the action ( [ s(phi ) ] ) , but it becomes important for the fluctuational conductivity @xcite : @xmath102{0x127 } } % beginexpansion \\rlap{\\protect\\rule[1.1ex]{.325em}{.1ex}}h% % endexpansion } \\frac{t_{c}}{t - t_{c } }   \\label{delta_sigma_xx}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the distance between planes .",
    "this result depends only weakly on the properties of the electrons if they form a fermi liquid even with a large relaxation rate .",
    "note that in the conventional bose condensation scenario real part of the relaxation time is absent @xcite leading to a much larger fluctuational correction to the longitudinal conductivity .",
    "thus , it would be important to understand whether this universal behavior ( [ delta_sigma_xx ] ) is indeed observed in high @xmath5 cuprates .",
    "fluctuational hall conductivity in low field is also controlled by the coefficients of the effective action ( [ s(phi ) ] ) @xcite : @xmath103{0x127 } } % beginexpansion \\rlap{\\protect\\rule[1.1ex]{.325em}{.1ex}}h% % endexpansion } \\left ( \\frac{t_{c}}{t - t_{c}}\\right ) ^{2 }   \\label{delta_sigma_xy}\\ ] ] here @xmath104 is the coefficient of the non - dissipative term in the action ( [ s(phi ) ] ) , in this model @xmath105 .",
    "this contribution should be added to the normal state hall conductivity . as a result",
    "a sign change of the hall effect would occur above @xmath5 at @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the mean free path ; here we used usual drude formula , @xmath108 , for the conductivity in the normal state .",
    "if @xmath109 the correction to @xmath110 is small and the hall effect changes sign in the region where the longitudinal conductivity is still close to the normal state value @xcite    in the vortex state the hydrodynamic contribution to the hall effect is @xcite @xmath111 in the generic time dependent ginzburg landau theory @xcite this contribution might be different by a numerical factor @xmath112 ; the physical effect taken into account by this numerical factor is electric field generated by the moving vortex .",
    "this effect is small and @xmath113 if the length , @xmath114 , which sets the scale for the electric field variations is long , @xmath115 , which seems to be an appropriate limit for cuprates . in conventional notations",
    "@xcite tdgl dimensionless parameter @xmath116 for these materials .    in the bose condensation scenario @xmath117 , at low temperatures @xmath118",
    "coincides with the boson density and the hall conductivity @xmath119 is huge . in the present model",
    "@xmath120 is small leading to a smaller value of the hall conductivity .    in the conventional bcs theory the coefficient @xmath104",
    "is determined by the dependence of the density of states , @xmath121 on the chemical potential ( @xmath122 ) ; here it is controlled by the bosons mediating the interaction between fermions .",
    "so , in the conventional bcs theory @xmath123 is small , @xmath124 , whereas here it is large .",
    "formally we get a large @xmath125 in the model ( [ h ] ) because we assumed that bosons are coupled to the pairs of electrons , not holes which introduced a large particle - hole asymmetry .",
    "this assumption can be justified if the fermion dispersion near van hove points is small so that properties of the bosons are determined by the relative number of electrons and holes in the disc area .",
    "further , if the number of electrons is small , the bosons are entirely electron - like and we get the phenomenological model ( [ h ] ) ; if the numbers of electrons and the holes in the disc area are close we would need to introduce two types of bosons ( electron - like and hole - like ) .",
    "this would lead to the effective action ( [ s(phi ) ] ) with @xmath126 and the resulting hall effect would be much smaller .",
    "these results show that @xmath104 is not necessarily related to @xmath127 as was conjectured in @xcite .",
    "the arguments of @xcite were based on the gauge invariance and on the assumption that @xmath5 dependence on @xmath128 implies a dependence on the gauge invariant object @xmath129 .",
    "this is true in the bcs model with weak interaction where this dependence is due to the density of states dependence on the chemical potential .",
    "however , in a general case one should distinguish two sources of @xmath130 dependence : the dependence via the energy of pairing electrons , @xmath131 , and the dependence via the total density of particles , @xmath132 .",
    "the gauge invariance indeed requires that @xmath133 is converted into the @xmath134 in the dynamical action but the dependence via the total density is not modified by the frequency so generally the quadratic term in the action is @xmath135 in other words , @xmath136 dependence does not imply a non - gauge invariant action , it can be reformulated in an explicitly gauge invariant manner as a dependence on @xmath137 .    in the phenomenological model ( [ h ] )",
    "the @xmath5 dependence on the doping , @xmath138 , is due to the interaction term , @xmath139 so that @xmath3 grows with doping .",
    "one possible microscopic mechanism of this dependence is suppression of the interaction @xmath139 by the gauge field fluctuations discussed in @xcite which becomes less in more doped systems .",
    "equations ( [ delta_sigma_xy],[sigma^v ] ) can be directly compared with the data .",
    "note here that fluctuational hall conductivity and hall conductivity in the flux flow regime are controlled by the same dimensionless parameter @xmath140 ; this is a general feature of any hydrodynamic description based on time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "experimental verification that one gets the same parameter if it is extracted from the hall data in the fluctuational regime above @xmath5 and if it is extracted from the data in the vortex flow regime would be a very important proof of the validity of the hydrodynamic approach .",
    "the comparison of these parameters becomes more complicated in weakly anisotropic materials such as @xmath16 where the fluctuational data are further complicated by the crossover between two and three dimensional behaviors ; to avoid these problems it is better to compare the data obtained on more anisotropic materials .",
    "first we compare the values of @xmath141 obtained on similar optimally doped materials .",
    "the extensive study @xcite of the fluctuation regime in @xmath142 shows that in the regime of 2d fluctuations @xmath143 at @xmath144 . using the value @xmath145 and @xmath146",
    "we obtain @xmath147 .",
    "unfortunately we are not aware of the hall effect data in the vortex flow regime on this material , so we compare this value with the other optimally doped cuprates .",
    "it is convenient to characterize hall conductivity data in the vortex flow regime by the value of @xmath148 obtained by a linear extrapolation to low temperatures .",
    "for @xmath16 we use extrapolated value @xmath149}\\frac{1}{\\omega cm}$ ] @xcite and @xmath150 ; we get @xmath151 . for @xmath152",

    "the fit of the fluctuational hall conductivity data obtained on the same sample agree with theoretical predictions if one chooses @xmath156 and @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "these data indicate that hydrodynamic approach is likely to be valid but do not allow to make a definite conclusion .",
    "they also show that in optimally doped materials @xmath158 , so the bosons may exist only as virtual states of electron pair .",
    "the situation is different for underdoped bilayered cuprates .",
    "we take extrapolated value @xmath159 @xcite and @xmath160 @xcite appropriate for @xmath27 @xmath161 ; we get @xmath162 in agreement with our initial expectations that bosons exist as real electron pairs in these materials . however the data on the underdoped @xmath44 lead to a different conclusion . here",
    "we take @xmath163 @xcite and @xmath160 @xcite for the material with @xmath164 , we get @xmath165 . this estimate implies that bosons are unlikely exist as real pairs in underdoped @xmath44 .",
    "we emphasize that we do not know of any data which would allow us to check that hydrodynamic approach remains valid for underdoped materials .",
    "the independent check of the validity of the hydrodynamic ( time dependent ginzburg - landau ) description in the flux flow regime is provided by the hall angle data _ in weak field region @xmath166_. in the framework of the effective action ( [ s(phi ) ] ) it is directly related with the same dimensionless parameter @xmath167 which we extracted from the hall conductivity @xcite @xmath168 the data @xcite for hall angle tangent in @xmath27 @xmath169 show that its value extrapolated to @xmath170 is @xmath171 , for @xmath172 @xmath173 it is much smaller , @xmath174 , finally for @xmath164 @xmath175 @xmath176 @xcite .",
    "all these values are in a resonable agreement with the above estimates for the parameter @xmath177 and usual expectation that @xmath178 .",
    "another physical property of the phenomenological model ( [ h ] ) is anomalous thermopower in the normal state .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is very sensitive to the value of @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the effective chemical potential of the pairs .",
    "we have only a rough estimate of this parameter based on the following arguments . the boson density in the phase space",
    "is @xmath181 ( here @xmath182 is bose factor ) , so @xmath183 ; such @xmath184 makes possible the scattering of electrons with energies larger than @xmath184 resulting in a large relaxation rate for these fermions . because this relaxation mechanism is effective only for fermions above the fermi energy it results in a large particle - hole asymmetry and leads to a large thermopower . assuming that this contribution to the relaxation rate @xmath185 is much larger than the typical relation rate for the fermions with energies less than @xmath184 we get seebeck coefficient @xmath186 which is much larger than the usual value , @xmath187 , for the normal metal .",
    "the sign of the thermopower is positive .",
    "its temperature dependence is non - monotonic , at @xmath188 the thermopower decreases with temperature due to the temperature dependence of @xmath189 , at higher temperatures , @xmath190 the temperature dependence of @xmath191 becomes negligible and thermopower becomes small and it increases with temperature .",
    "the sign and the value of the thermopower are in agreement with the experiment @xcite , but its temperature dependence at high temperatures is not .",
    "this is not very surprising because this model does not describe the transport properties at high temperatures which are due to a new physics associated with the appearance of low energy modes .",
    "the disagreement between the predictions of the model ( [ h ] ) and data implies that these low energy modes are responsible for the temperature dependence of the thermopower at high temperatures .",
    "the model ( [ h ] ) applies to the superconductivity in the underdoped cuprates where gap opens above @xmath5 , we expect a more usual transition in the overdoped cuprates .",
    "the crossover from underdoped to overdoped occurs in the framework of the model ( [ h ] ) if @xmath65 and @xmath55 is increased with doping ; at large @xmath65 the transition can be described in terms of the virtual pair formation and becomes very similar to a usual bcs picture .",
    "however , even in this regime the contribution of these virtual pairs to the @xmath192 coefficient in time dependent ginzburg landau equations can be much larger than the contribution coming from the density of states dependence near the fermi surface and may result in a sign change of the hall effect . in the optimally doped cuprates @xmath193 is still non - zero and we expect a large hydrodynamic contribution to the hall effect and large positive thermopower .    in the optimally doped cuprates and in the underdoped ones above the temperature of the pseudogap formation one",
    "expects new physical effects due to the appearance of new low energy modes .",
    "these soft modes are responsible for the anomalous transport relaxation rates .",
    "another probe of the effect of these modes in the optimally doped cuprates ( where they are expected to exist down to the transition temperature ) is the fluctuational conductivity which should no longer be given by universal form ( [ delta_sigma_xx ] ) .",
    "it is important to determine experimentally whether fluctuational conductivity agrees with a phenomenological fermi liquid picture with large relaxation rate which gives universal form ( [ delta_sigma_xx ] ) , if the data do not fit the universal form ( [ delta_sigma_xx ] ) it means that this phenomenological fermi liquid picture is not applicable at all even for the in - plane properties .",
    "a model similar to ( 3 ) but in real space also describes a phase transition of the system of superconducting grains embedded in the normal matrix . in this case",
    "the mixed @xmath194 term corresponds to the andreev reflection at the ns boundary . in this system",
    "the hall effect in the superconducting state is governed by the particle hole assymetry of the grains and may change sign close to @xmath0 .",
    "in conclusion we have shown that the phenomenological description of the superconductivity which follows from the concept of preformed pairs coexisting with electrons on some patches of the fermi surface agrees semi - quantitatively with available data on hall conductivity in the fluctuation and flux flow regime and with the small value of the ginzburg parameter for underdoped bilayeres cuprates .",
    "however in order to describe the data on optimally doped bilayered cuprates or underdoped @xmath2 one needs to assume that the value of the chemical potential for these pairs is large so that preformed pairs exist only as virtual states .",
    "the important necessary ingredients of this model are ( 1 ) the assumption that the pairs have very little dispersion of their own and ( 2 ) their coupling to the electrons on the fermi surface is weak . the hydrodynamic contribution to the hall effect in this model",
    "is controlled by the pairs and has electron - like sign ; it explains the hall sign change observed experimentally .",
    "it is not possible to test thoroghly the predictions of the model because experiments which give data on the hall and longitudinal conductivity in the fluctuational and vortex flow regime obtained on the same sample are scarce .",
    "such data on underdoped ( spin gapped ) materials do not exist at all",
    ". it would be very important to verify experimentally that hydrodynamic approach is still valid for the underdoped cuprates ( i.e. that the parameters extracted from the fluctuational regime are the same as those extracted from vortex flow regime ) and that the parameters needed for the hydrodynamic description are indeed in agreement with the picture of preformed pairs coexisting with fermions as we conclude here using a limited number of data .",
    "we wish to thank g. blatter , p. coleman , a. millis , and t. m. rice for helpful discussions and a. samoilov for showing us his unpublished data .",
