    "research into einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory , which concerns the coupling of gauge fields described by the yang - mills ( ym ) equations to gravitational fields described by einstein s equations , has become abundant in the literature in the last couple of decades . this work began in considering asymptotically flat , spherically symmetric , ` hairy ' black holes @xcite and solitons ( ` particle - like solutions ' ) @xcite , coupled to a gauge field with structure group @xmath5 .",
    "this field of enquiry first emerged in the 1980s and thus the asymptotically flat @xmath6 and @xmath4 systems are now well understood in a variety of cases  see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the problem with asymptotically flat eym systems is that they have some tricky properties which provide analytical and numerical difficulties when obtaining solutions .",
    "first , global solutions are not abundant : due to strong constraints on the boundary conditions in the limit @xmath7 , and at the origin in the case of solitons ( see e.g. @xcite ) , regular solutions may only be found for certain discrete points in the boundary parameter space @xcite and so global solutions are hard to find both numerically and analytically .",
    "connected to this is their stability : @xmath4 purely magnetic solutions decouple into two sectors upon a linear perturbation , and spectral analysis shows that @xmath6 solutions possess @xmath8 unstable modes in each sector , where @xmath8 is the number of nodes ( zeroes ) of the gauge field ; and in addition , these @xmath6 solutions must possess at least one node @xcite .",
    "this is related to the discrete nature of the globally regular solutions which are separated by continua of singular solutions : a small perturbation will turn any existing regular solution into a singular one .",
    "a node in the gauge field corresponds to a reversal of the field direction  in a physical sense , we may intuit that this will lead to the instability of solutions .",
    "this instability result can be extended to general compact semisimple gauge groups , so that any global solutions that could be found would be necessarily unstable @xcite .",
    "however for @xmath1 , the picture changes completely . here , because of the ` box - like ' geometry of anti - de sitter ( ads ) space , it is much easier to set up the ` balancing act ' occurring between the repulsive ym forces and the attractive force of gravity , whereas for @xmath9 , the geometry is ` open ' and hair will in general destabilise and radiate away to infinity or else collapse inwards . it can be shown that in the ads case , we in general get a continuum of solutions in the parameter space @xcite , making them much easier to find and to analyse .",
    "connected to this , we may also find nodeless solutions , and can show that at least some of these are stable in the cases of @xmath6 for spherically symmetric @xcite and non - spherically symmetric @xcite perturbations .",
    "also we have established linear stability for @xmath4 spherically symmetric @xcite and so - called ` topological ' @xcite solutions . for a review of recent solutions ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ads solutions have been considered recently for other applications : due to the ads / cft ( conformal field theory ) correspondence , gravitational theories in the bulk of ads space can be translated into particle theories on the boundary , meaning that results concerning hairy black holes ( in particular ) may provide insight into condensed matter physics ( cmp ) phenomena ( for a review of ads / cft holography , see @xcite ) .",
    "quite recently , the literature has been replete with special cases of hairy solutions in ads eym theory , including cases such as _ dyons _ ( possessing a non - trivial electric sector of the gauge potential ) @xcite , and topological black holes @xcite of the kind first considered in @xcite . this work has solely considered the gauge group @xmath10 . however , in the case of asymptotically flat , spherically symmetric solutions with a _",
    "general _ compact gauge group and for the case of the so - called _ regular _ action ( defined in @xcite and referred to as ` generic ' in @xcite  see section [ sec : fes ] ) , it is found that the field equations are very similar to the @xmath4 case , and many qualitative features of the solutions carry over as well @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems logical to perform the same experiment on the asymptotically ads , spherically symmetric eym system for a general compact semisimple gauge group , and to see how many features are present in both the general case and the specific @xmath4 case .",
    "also strongly motivating this work is the possibility of exploring a very wide class of matter theories , both for the sake of cmp , and for further refinement of the `` no - hair '' theorem ( see section [ ggeconc ] ) which is relevant to gravitational physics .",
    "for the regular case at least , which is the main case considered in the literature so far , we see that it is not even necessary to know the ym one - form connection explicitly in order to obtain the field equations  all the information one needs is essentially in the cartan matrix of the lie algebra of the structure group @xmath11 which represents the gauge field , making it easy to apply to a wide spectrum of eym theories .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , in sections [ sec : conn ] and [ sec : fes ] we will describe how we use our anstze to carve down the general field equations for four dimensional ads eym theory with a general compact gauge group in the case of the ` regular action ' , which we will describe later ; and we show that in doing so , it coincides with the _ principal _ action  this allows us to simplify the field equations considerably .",
    "in fact , they become very similar in form to the field equations for @xmath4 @xcite . in section [ sec :",
    "bcs ] , we consider the boundary conditions needed for our solutions to be regular at @xmath12 ( or @xmath13 ) and as @xmath7 . in section [ sec : asym ] , we examine the asymptotic limit of the field equations @xmath7 in a ` dynamical systems ' sense , which turns out to be much simpler than it was for asymptotically flat space . then in section",
    "[ sec : embed ] we identify some trivial embedded solutions , which are important to our final results .    in section [ sec : locex ]",
    ", we prove the existence of solutions locally at the boundaries , which are unique and analytic in their boundary parameters .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : gloex ] , after proving that solutions may be regularly integrated out from the initial boundary into the asymptotic regime , we finish by establishing our main results : that global nodeless black hole and soliton solutions may be found in a neighbourhood of some trivial solutions found in section [ sec : embed ] , which are everywhere regular and uniquely and consistently specified by their boundary conditions ; and that nodeless black hole and soliton solutions can be found in the limit @xmath3 ( section [ sec : l0 ] ) , anticipating a later investigation into the stability of these solutions . in section [ ggeconc ]",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "for asymptotically flat space , it is found @xcite that we can reduce our attention from considering all possible conjugacy classes of bundle automorphisms by restricting focus to those for which the ym fields decay sufficiently fast at either boundary ( @xmath7 , and/or @xmath13 if the solution is a soliton ) .",
    "these are called ` regular models ' in @xcite and correspond to the ` zero magnetic charge ' case in @xcite . a conjugacy class of @xmath5 bundle automorphisms is characterised by a generator @xmath14 which is an element of the cartan subalgebra @xmath15  for regular models",
    ", @xmath14 must be an @xmath16-_vector _ ,",
    "i.e. the defining vector of a @xmath17-subalgebra of @xmath18 .",
    "there is a remarkably wide variety of such actions for the case of @xmath4 , as noted by bartnik @xcite ; and such @xmath16-vectors are finite and have been tabulated @xcite .",
    "the presence of a non - zero @xmath19 does not _",
    "directly _ affect the automorphism classes on the bundle structure , and therefore some similar results to @xcite will here be derived , as we describe how to express the field equations for these regular models . but",
    "@xmath19 does make a difference asymptotically , and so we find a big difference in the regularity requirements for solutions in the limit @xmath7 ( as may be expected from previous treatments of @xmath4 @xcite ) ; as such , we note that the definition of ` regular models ' as given above must be amended a little for asymptotically ads space",
    ".    let @xmath11 from here on be a compact semisimple connected and simply connected gauge group with lie algebra @xmath18 . to consider spherically symmetric eym connections is to consider principal @xmath5 automorphisms on principal @xmath11-bundles @xmath20 with base manifold @xmath21 ( our spacetime ) , such that the automorphisms project onto isometry actions in @xmath21 whose orbits are diffeomorphic to 2-spheres . since there is no natural action of @xmath5 on @xmath20 , we must consider all conjugacy classes of such automorphisms .",
    "these conjugacy classes are in one - to - one correspondence to integral elements @xmath14 of a closed fundamental weyl chamber @xmath22 belonging to a base @xmath23 of the roots of @xmath18 with respect to a chosen cartan subalgebra @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath24 be the ( real ) lie algebra of the structure group @xmath11 of the bundle @xmath20 , so that @xmath25 , its complexification . also , let @xmath26 , @xmath27 be the standard basis of @xmath6 defined using the pauli matrices , with commutator relations @xmath28=\\epsilon_{ijk}\\tau_k$ ] , for @xmath29 the levi - civita antisymmetric symbol .",
    "then @xmath14 may be chosen such that @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the homomorphism from the isotropy group @xmath32 of the @xmath5-action on @xmath21 at the point @xmath33 , determined by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fibre above @xmath36 and the central dot notation denotes the adjoint action .",
    "the subject of possible classes of connections over principal bundles has been covered in the literature by wang and others @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is known that we may write the metric in common spherical schwarzschild - type co - ordinates @xmath37 as @xmath38 note that we here consider only static solutions , meaning all field variables are functions of @xmath39 alone .",
    "in addition , brodbeck and straumann @xcite show that in this case a gauge may always be chosen such that the yang - mills one - form potential is locally given as @xmath40 in the above , @xmath41 is a one - form defined on the quotient space of the manifold which is entirely parametrised by the @xmath42 co - ordinates , representing the ` electric ' part of the connection .",
    "here we consider the _ purely magnetic _ case , and hence we set @xmath43 .",
    "we note that for @xmath44 this sector is not available in regular models @xcite ; it is available for @xmath1 but we find in the @xmath4 case that the condition @xmath45 still yields a rich space of solutions @xcite .",
    "also , we have @xmath46 as the constant isotropy generator , and we have constraints on @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( both also functions of @xmath39 ) , @xmath49=w_2,\\qquad [ w_2,w_3]=w_1,\\ ] ] which we refer to as the _ wang equations _ @xcite .",
    "however , we still have a countably infinite number of possible actions of @xmath5 on @xmath20 : one for each element in @xmath50 , the intersection of the closed fundamental weyl chamber and the integral lattice defined by @xmath51 .",
    "now for regular models , we require the ym fields to be non - singular at the centre @xmath13 ( for solitons ) and asymptotically as @xmath7 .    in the case of @xmath44",
    ", this implied that @xmath52=w_3,\\ ] ] and/or @xmath53=w_3,\\ ] ] where we define @xmath54 for @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "that is to say , for asymptotically flat space , in at least one of these limits ( if they exist ) there has to exist a lie algebra homomorphism from @xmath6 into @xmath24 ; and if both limits exist , there also must exist a homomorphism between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the reason for the constraints and is that in asymptotically flat space , the values of the gauge field functions @xmath59 at @xmath13 and as @xmath7 ( taken in a particular basis that we will describe ) must be equal to a particular set of constants @xmath60 that depend on the cartan matrix of the reduced subalgebra in question .",
    "this implies that the soliton solutions have no magnetic charge , according to @xcite .",
    "the constraints on the boundary values of the gauge fields are necessary so that the tangential pressure @xmath61 and energy density @xmath62 ( see section [ sec : fes ] ) remain regular at infinity .    however , for @xmath1 we have a different scenario . as we shall see , the values of the gauge field functions at the centre @xmath13 are still highly constrained , reflecting the singular nature of that boundary , and thus still holds ; but asymptotically , the `` fall - off '' conditions required to force the gauge field to be regular are much laxer than for @xmath44 , and thus the gauge field functions and their derivatives will in general approach arbitrary asymptotic values .",
    "again this is due to the nature of the asymptotic system considered in a dynamical systems sense .    our investigation in section [ sec : asym ]",
    "will show that this lack of asymptotic constraints on the ym field is to do with the nature of the variable change that we perform to render the asymptotic field equations autonomous , which in the case of asymptotically flat space necessitates the trajectory of every regular solution to end at a critical point ( which we ll call @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) in the phase plane of the system .",
    "the critical points of the field equations are thus @xmath65 for @xmath66 , where @xmath67 ; the important point here being that for @xmath44 , one is forced to have @xmath68 ( @xmath64 ) , whereas for @xmath1 , @xmath69 ( @xmath64 ) in general .",
    "hence , does not have to hold for our solutions , and as we will see , this is manifested in the fact that for ads space , no constraints are placed on the gauge field functions or their derivatives as @xmath7 , and we are allowed solutions with a global magnetic charge fixed essentially by the cartan matrix of the reduced subalgebra , for which the tangential pressure and the energy density remain regular asymptotically .",
    "( of course , and will both be trivially satisfied by embedded schwarzschild anti - de sitter solutions ( see section [ sec : embed ] ) , and so for this solution at least , there must also exist a lie algebra homomorphism from @xmath70 into @xmath71 @xcite . ) it must be noted though , it is still obviously true from the field equations that for regularity we must have    @xmath72=w_3.\\ ] ]    thus , for asymptotically ads space , the _ system itself _ still will possess the constraints at the critical point @xmath73 , but solutions will not reach the critical point of the system in general , freeing the asymptotic solution parameters from the constraints that are seen in the @xmath44 case .",
    "this is what is responsible for the much larger space of black hole solutions in the @xmath4 case , which we see need obey _ neither _ nor ; though we also emphasise that at the origin , regular solutions must still obey .",
    "thus , as in the case of @xmath4 for ads , we may expect the local existence proofs to be straightforward for @xmath12 and @xmath7 and much more involved at the origin @xmath13 .",
    "now since @xmath74 is constant , and represent constraints also on @xmath74 , and hence on @xmath14 which must be the generating vector of an @xmath16- ( i.e. @xmath17- ) subalgebra of @xmath18 .",
    "however the set of such so - called _",
    "@xmath16-vectors _ is finite , and have been tabulated by dynkin @xcite and malcev @xcite using what they call `` characteristics '' , which are in one - to - one correspondence with finite ordered sets of integers chosen from the set @xmath75 .",
    "these strings of integers then represent the value of the simple roots on @xmath14 , the defining vector of the @xmath16-subalgebra , chosen so that it lies in @xmath22 ; and the tables of malcev and dynkin therefore give us a classification of all possible spherically symmetric , purely magnetic eym models which obey the correct regularity conditions asymptotically and at the centre , for any compact semisimple simply connected gauge group .",
    "to proceed , we can note that out of all the possible actions classified by dynkin and malcev @xcite , these exists a privileged class of actions which corresponds to a principal @xmath16-vector in dynkin s terminology , which oliynyk and knzle @xcite called _ principal _ actions .",
    "there exists a slightly larger class of actions called ` regular ' in @xcite ( and ` generic ' in @xcite ) , for which the defining vector lies in the _ interior _ of a fundamental weyl chamber .",
    "( the other _ irregular _ case involves the defining vector being on the boundary of a weyl chamber . )    in this section we will show that for @xmath1 , as it was for @xmath44 , all models with a regular action can be reduced to those with the principal action , for any semisimple gauge group . in terms of the field variables , this means that the ym potential can be chosen to be composed of real functions due to a gauge freedom , and that there are @xmath76 of such functions where @xmath67 .",
    "we also have two metric functions governed by the einstein equations : @xmath77 ( the _ mass _ function ) and @xmath78 ( the _ lapse _ function )",
    ". then the field equations are determined by @xmath79 real functions of the radial co - ordinate @xmath39 alone ( for static , spherically symmetric solutions ) , and possess singularities at the centre @xmath13 , the event horizon @xmath12 and as @xmath7 .    a more convenient basis to use here for the wang equations in place of the generators @xmath47 and @xmath48 is @xmath80 in which case equations become @xmath81=\\pm 2w_\\pm , \\qquad [ w_+,w_-]=w_0.\\ ] ] then @xmath82 are @xmath18-valued functions",
    ", @xmath14 is a constant vector in a fundamental weyl chamber of @xmath15 , and @xmath83 is a standard @xmath6 triple in the limit @xmath13 and at the critical points of the system .",
    "also , @xmath15 is the cartan subalgebra of the complexified form of the lie algebra , i.e. @xmath84 , for @xmath85 the real cartan subalgebra of @xmath24 , which in turn is the real compactified form of @xmath18 .",
    "naturally , we introduce a complex conjugation operator @xmath86 with convention @xmath87 this implies that @xmath88 therefore the solutions will only depend on the functions @xmath89 , @xmath90 and the complex components of @xmath91 .    the field equations in the case @xmath44",

    "these factors are chosen so that @xmath107 is a positive multiple of the killing form on each simple component .",

    "near @xmath13 we may simply use the independent variable @xmath39 , and hence we expand all field variables and quantities as @xmath195    for a general function @xmath196 .",
    "thus we obtain the following recurrence relations for @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 :    [ recur0 ] @xmath200    here , @xmath201 is the matrix defined by @xmath202 @xmath203 is the kronecker symbol ; and the left - hand side of , the vector @xmath204 , is a complicated vector expression involving the coefficients of the field variable expansions .",
    "we can see that these equations are identical to the @xmath4 case @xcite , and so again , we may solve and and obtain a solution with @xmath76 free parameters on condition that the recurrence relations can be solved .",
    "this in turn is conditional upon the vectors @xmath205 lying in the left kernel of the matrix @xmath206 .",
    "as we noted , @xmath205 is a complicated expression and so this is difficult to prove in general . in section [ sec : lex0 ]",
    ", we generalise proofs in @xcite which depend directly on the root structure of the lie algebra @xmath18 treated as an @xmath207 submodule .",
    "we note here that @xmath208 for @xmath209 . for the lower order terms ,",
    "we find : @xmath210    the equations are identical to those we found in the @xmath4 case , therefore we expect a similar situation to occur here , in that the higher order terms of the power series expansions near the origin will in general display a complicated interdependence .",
    "this reflects the fact that @xmath13 is a singular point of the field equations . at this boundary ,",
    "the higher order coefficients which remain arbitrary occur at the orders @xmath211 for which @xmath212 is an eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath206 .",
    "but in fact , the eigenvalues of @xmath206 can happily be shown to be @xmath212 for a series of integer values of @xmath213 , which series depends on the lie algebra in question .",
    "( for @xmath4 , this series of integers is simply the natural numbers from 1 to @xmath214 inclusive . ) for all the simple lie algebras , we may calculate the spectrum of eigenvalues from the cartan matrix by using the definition  see table [ table1 ] for this information .",
    "the proof for the classical lie algebras then follows from the properties of the root structure and the results at the end of section [ sec : sl2c ] .",
    "we will see in section [ sec_lex0 ] that in some neighbourhood of @xmath13 , the relevant field variables have the following behaviour : @xmath215    here , @xmath216 is a non - singular matrix , @xmath217 are integers and @xmath218 are some functions of @xmath39  all of these we will define later . also , @xmath219 is fixed by , @xmath220 is fixed by the requirement that @xmath221 as @xmath7 , and @xmath222 . therefore altogether we have @xmath76 free solution parameters here in total , namely @xmath223 for each @xmath224 .",
    ".this table shows @xmath225 . for the classical lie algebras the table shows @xmath217 for @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "note that @xmath186 belongs to all lie algebras , thus @xmath226 always . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      for a regular non - extremal event horizon , we require @xmath227 to vanish and @xmath228 to be finite and positive .",
    "this severely restricts the solution parameters here and hence reduces the degrees of freedom of any solution , which makes boundary conditions easy to find .    using the notation @xmath229 and transforming to a new variable @xmath230",
    ", we find that @xmath231 where @xmath232    the constraint @xmath233 implies that @xmath234 with @xmath235    the condition @xmath236 places a bound on @xmath237 :    @xmath238    with @xmath239 therefore , it is clear that fixing @xmath240 and @xmath105 , and regarding @xmath241 as fixed by the requirement that the solution is asymptotically ads , the solution parameters are given by the set @xmath242 .",
    "thus , as at the origin , we have @xmath76 solution degrees of freedom for solutions existing locally at the event horizon .",
    "we assume power series for all field variables which are good in the asymptotic limit , i.e. of the form @xmath243 . it is easy to see that this implies @xmath244 , meaning that examining",
    ", @xmath78 must be of the form @xmath245 .",
    "we also use the basis @xmath246 .",
    "therefore , we find that the expansions near infinity must be @xmath247    the power series expansions here are a lot less complicated than for the asymptotically flat case .",
    "no constraints appear on @xmath248 or @xmath249 .",
    "similarly , no constraints are placed on @xmath250 or @xmath251 , so we rescale to @xmath252 and let @xmath253 ( the constant arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass ) so that the solution asymptotically is the sads solution ( or pure ads space if @xmath254 ) .",
    "we find that each new term we calculate in the expansions is entirely determined by previously calculated terms , and this trend continues for higher order terms .",
    "for instance , the lower order terms are @xmath255 therefore we anticipate that proving the existence of unique solutions to the boundary value problem will be a lot less involved than in the case of @xmath44 . in summary ,",
    "our solution parameters here are @xmath256 and thus we have @xmath257 degrees of freedom in total .",
    "as we saw , the asymptotic boundary conditions imply that any regular solutions in this limit will have gauge functions which are characterised entirely by the arbitrary values @xmath248 and @xmath249 , with all higher order terms in the expansions determined by these parameters .",
    "this is in opposition to the @xmath44 case , where the asymptotic values of the gauge field have to approach particular values , and the higher order terms display complicated interdependence related to the intercoupling of the gauge functions caused by equation .",
    "therefore what we wish to do now is take the asymptotic limit of the field equations , transform the independent variable @xmath39 so that the system becomes ` autonomous ' in the dynamical systems sense , and examine the nature of the phase plane of the system . as we will see , it is not so much the asymptotic field equations themselves which give us the difference in behaviour between the @xmath44 and @xmath1 cases  it is the form of the parameter we must transform to which dictates the asymptotic behaviour of the field variables , and which gives us an infinitely more plentiful space of regular solutions .",

    "eigenvalue analysis shows these ( for each @xmath224 ) to be a centre and a pair of saddles , respectively .",
    "we noted that the analysis of the asymptotic boundary conditions implied no such constraints on the asymptotic value of @xmath161 , though the autonomous asymptotic equations are identical to those for @xmath44 .",
    "we may resolve this apparent discrepancy by noting that for @xmath1 , the trajectory of a solution in the phase plane @xmath270 will not in general reach its critical point .",
    "this is due to the nature of the parameter we used to render the equations autonomous . in the case of @xmath44",
    "the parameter used was @xmath271 , so that the range @xmath272 ( @xmath273 for black holes , or @xmath274 for solitons ) corresponds to @xmath275 , and hence any trajectory for a regular solution in the limit @xmath7 will be destined to end at a critical point .    for @xmath1",
    "however , we use @xmath276 , meaning that the range @xmath272 corresponds to the range @xmath277 .",
    "therefore , as we take the asymptotic limit @xmath7 , the corresponding trajectories in terms of @xmath278 will shrink and only traverse a short distance in the phase plane .",
    "hence the trajectories , and therefore the values of the gauge field functions and their derivatives , will in general approach arbitrary values asymptotically .",
    "we note that this is precisely the same as in the @xmath4 case @xcite .    in summary",
    "then , our investigation has shown that we need not be concerned with the behaviour of the field equations for @xmath39 arbitrarily large  as long as we can integrate into the asymptotic region , the solution will remain regular until reaching the ( arbitrary ) boundary conditions at @xmath7 .",
    "we will return to this point in section [ sec : gloex ] .",
    "our argument in section [ sec : gloex ] will rely on the existence of embedded ( or ` trivial ' ) solutions , as we will prove the existence of global solutions to the field equations to in some neighbourhood of these .",
    "therefore , we here review some easily obtainable embedded solutions to our field equations .      here",
    "we let @xmath279 . in that case",
    ", we find that @xmath280 and therefore @xmath78 becomes a constant , which we scale to 1 .",
    "the metric function @xmath193 becomes @xmath281 where @xmath21 is the adm mass of the solution , and the magnetic charge @xmath282 is defined with @xmath283    therefore we have obtained the embedded reissner - nrdstrom anti - de sitter solution , which only exists with this value of @xmath284 , and coincides with the @xmath4 case @xcite , using and the @xmath4 cartan matrix .",

    "this solution carries no global charge , and can be identified as the embedded schwarzschild anti - de sitter solution .",
    "summarising this solution : @xmath292      noting that we can embed @xmath5 isomorphically into any semisimple gauge group @xmath11 , then there must always exist trivial embedded @xmath6 solutions to the field equations to .",
    "we may show this by a simple rescaling .",

    ". select any basis such that the set @xmath293 spans @xmath6 , with @xmath294 .",

    "now we have much information about the behaviour of the solutions to the field equations nearby the boundaries of our spacetime , enough to prove local existence at those boundaries . to do this , we rely on a well - known theorem of differential equations @xcite , generalised to the appropriate case by @xcite .",

    "moreover , the solution depends analytically on the parameters @xmath312 .",
    "essentially , the proof of this theorem proceeds from the requirement that formal power series may be found for the field variables at the boundaries in question .",
    "we now consider those boundaries one by one .      as we hinted in section",
    "[ sec : bcs ] , we do not expect much of a difference between the asymptotically flat and asymptotically ads cases nearby the origin , because as @xmath313 , the terms in the field equations involving the cosmological constant become negligible .",
    "hence we may proceed along very similar lines to those in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we now collect all necessary results from @xcite needed to prove local existence of solutions near @xmath13 . the general idea is to consider the root structure of @xmath314 taken as a lie algebra submodule of @xmath18 .",
    "note that the results in this section are only necessary for this boundary , and hence only for solitons .",
    "first we introduce our conventions .",

    "we again use a central dot notation @xmath329 to represent the adjoint action , i.e. @xmath330 but since @xmath14 is a semisimple element , @xmath331 is diagonalisable , and so from @xmath17 representation theory we know that the eigenvalues are integers .",
    "therefore we define @xmath332 as the eigenspaces of @xmath331 , i.e. with @xmath333 it also follows from @xmath207 representation theory that if @xmath334 is a highest weight vector of the adjoint representation of @xmath335 with weight @xmath8 , and we define @xmath336 , @xmath337 and @xmath338 ( @xmath339 ) , then @xmath340    now we are ready to state a series of results proven in @xcite which will help us to prove existence locally at @xmath13 .",
    "essentially , these are necessary because we find that the term @xmath341 in the ym equation is the only term which resists our rearrangement of the field equations in a form appropriate to theorem [ kthm3 ] , and it is necessary to argue that certain lower order term of @xmath341 ( in a power series sense ) are zero .",

    "immediately we have @xmath513 and it is clear that there exist analytic maps @xmath514 , @xmath515 , with @xmath516 define an analytic map @xmath517 by @xmath518 then we can see that @xmath519",

    "the behaviour of solutions in the asymptotic limit is the biggest difference between the asymptotically flat and ads cases . because of the constraints on the asymptotic values of the gauge functions for @xmath44 , the proof followed a similar route to the local existence at the origin .",
    "however for @xmath1 , our situation is much more similar to the local existence at the event horizon , so we follow a similar method to that used in proposition [ prop : lexrh ] from section [ sec : lexrh ] .",
    "hence , the same comments apply as at the beginning of section [ sec : lexrh ] : we do not need any of the results of section [ sec : sl2c ] here , and thus we use the notation @xmath488 out of utility .    to deal sensibly with the limit @xmath7 we transform to the variable @xmath542 whence we are now dealing with the limit @xmath543 .",
    "we state our proposition :    [ prop : lexinf ] there exist regular solutions of the field equations in some neighbourhood of @xmath544 , analytic and unique with respect to their initial values , of the form @xmath545 for arbitrary constants @xmath248 , @xmath249 ; where in order to agree with the asymptotic limit of ads space , we have let @xmath253 , the adm mass of the solution , and @xmath252 .",

    "now we turn our attention to proving the existence of global solutions to our field equations . here",
    "we have a choice of approaches .",
    "we considered using the more novel approach of nolan and winstanley @xcite who let the initial conditions and embedded solutions reside in appropriate banach spaces , and then recast the field equations so that they could apply the implicit function theorem , hence proving that non - trivial solutions exist in some neighbourhood of embedded solutions .",
    "however , it appears to be necessary to their argument that @xmath89 is constant for the embedded solution , something we have not been able to get around yet , meaning that we could only identify solutions in a neighbourhood of the embedded sads solution .",
    "alternatively , the traditional argument that has been used in this case is the ` shooting argument ' ( used in e.g. @xcite ) , which basically involves proving the existence of solutions locally at the boundaries , and then proving that solutions which begin at the initial boundary @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) near to existing embedded solutions can be integrated out arbitrarily far , remaining regular right into the asymptotic regime , where they will ` meet up ' with solutions existing locally at @xmath7 ; and that these neighbouring solutions will remain close to the embedded solution .",
    "while this seems somehow less elegant , there are no restrictions on the embedded solution we may use , and hence the proof we are able to create is more general and hence more powerful .",
    "therefore , we resign ourselves to using the more traditional techniques .",
    "we begin by noting that we have already considered the behaviour of the field equations in the asymptotic limit and shown that solutions will in general remain regular in this regime ( section [ sec : asym ] ) , so we must now make sure that any solution which begins regularly at the initial boundary @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) can be integrated out arbitrarily far while the field variables remain regular .",
    "[ prop : gloreg ] if @xmath571 for black holes , or @xmath572 for solitons , then all field variables may be integrated out from the boundary conditions at the event horizon ( or the origin ) into the asymptotic regime , and will remain regular .    * proof * define @xmath573 and @xmath574 $ ] , where @xmath273 for black holes and @xmath274 for solitons , and @xmath575 .",

    "this means using that @xmath582 and thus @xmath89 is monotonic increasing , as expected for the physical mass .",
    "this means that ( if it exists ) , @xmath583 the same applies to @xmath584 ( see ) , showing that @xmath585 and hence @xmath90 is monotonic increasing too , so that ( again , if we can prove that @xmath78 is finite on @xmath579 ) @xmath586    the condition @xmath587 gives us our starting point , since this implies that @xmath588 giving us an absolute upper bound to work with .",

    "@xmath298      finally , we may prove the major conclusions of our research , which hinge on the following theorem .",
    "the gist of it is that global solutions to the field equations  , which we have proven are uniquely characterised by the appropriate boundary values and analytic in those values , exist in open sets of the initial parameter space ; and hence that solutions which begin sufficiently close to existing solutions to the field equations will remain close to them as they are integrated out arbitrarily far into the asymptotic regime , remaining regular throughout the range . it can be noted that this argument is quite similar to those we have used for the @xmath4 case @xcite .",

    "the purpose of this research was to investigate the existence of global black hole and soliton solutions to spherically symmetric , four dimensional eym theories with compact semisimple connected and simply connected gauge groups .",
    "we began by stating the basic elements of the theory , describing the analogy to the asymptotically flat case considered in @xcite .",
    "we derived the basic field equations for ads eym theory , and then explained how to reduce the model down to the case for the regular action @xcite , in which the constant isotropy generator @xmath14 lies in an open fundamental weyl chamber of the cartan subalgebra @xmath15 . in this case",
    "it may be shown that the regular action reduces to the principal action described in @xcite , which simplified the field equations greatly .",
    "we went on to investigate the boundary conditions at @xmath13 , @xmath12 and as @xmath7 ( section [ sec : bcs ] ) .",
    "we found that the analysis at the event horizon and at the origin ( propositions [ prop : lex0 ] and [ prop : lexrh ] ) carried over similarly from the asymptotically flat case @xcite , with some minor alterations .",
    "the biggest difference in the analyses was in the asymptotic behaviour of solutions ( proposition [ prop : lexinf ] ) .",
    "there , we found that the gauge functions and their derivatives were entirely specified by the arbitrary values they approach at infinity  this differs greatly from the @xmath667 case , in which the gauge field was specified by higher order parameters in the power series , and these parameters were intercoupled in a complicated way .",
    "this difference is explained in section [ sec : asym ] , where it is noted that due to the parameter we use to render the equations autonomous , the solutions to this system ( in terms of dynamical systems ) need not reach their critical points , which was what forced the asymptotically flat system to be so tightly constrained as @xmath7 .    due to this difference",
    ", it became possible in section [ sec : gloex ] to prove the existence of global solutions to the field equations in some neighbourhood of embedded solutions , of which we found three separate cases ( section [ sec : embed ] ) .",
    "we proved that as long as @xmath611 throughout the solution range , then if we begin at the initial boundary ( @xmath12 for black holes or @xmath13 for solitons ) and integrate the field equations out arbitrarily far , the field variables will all remain regular ( proposition [ prop : gloreg ] ) .",
    "we recall that we already established in section [ sec : asym ] that general solutions will remain regular in the asymptotic regime .",
    "therefore , we were able to argue the existence of black hole and soliton solutions which begin regularly at their initial conditions and can be regularly integrated out arbitrarily far , where they will remain regular as @xmath7 ( theorem [ prop : gloex ] ) .",
    "we finally considered the limit of @xmath3 , which we explained was necessary in the @xmath4 case to guarantee nodeless and hence stable solutions , and proved that nodeless non - trivial solutions exist in this regime too , which are similarly globally regular and analytic in their boundary parameters ( theorem [ thr : l0 ] ) .",
    "our main results are the proof of global non - trivial solutions to the field equations  , both nearby trivial embedded solutions , and in the limit of @xmath627 large .",
    "it is remarkable to see how many of the general features of this model carry across to the specific case of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these include the forms of the field equations themselves , the embedded solutions we find , the qualitative behaviour of the solutions at the various boundaries , and the existence of solutions both near embedded solutions and in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "this is very pleasing , since it may be noticed that the field equations  may easily be adapted to any gauge group without precise knowledge of the gauge potential itself , the construction of which for a given gauge group is a non - trivial task .",
    "this quite general system , even restricted to solely the regular case , could thus prove to be a powerful analytical model which may give insight into a range of different matter field theories .",
    "there are many future directions that this work could take .",
    "considering the work in @xcite , a logical next step might be to consider the ` irregular ' case , where @xmath14 lies on the boundary of a fundamental weyl chamber , and the situation is more intricate .",
    "for instance , for @xmath44 it is known that this means the gauge functions @xmath59 will in general be complex .",
    "an analysis of that case , in combination with the results here presented , would cover an existence analysis for black holes and solitons in all possible static , spherically symmetric , purely magnetic eym ads models with a compact semisimple gauge group .    another obvious thing to do is to consider the question of the stability of the solutions that we have found . in @xcite , brodbeck and straumann",
    "give a proof of instability for a general compact gauge group in asymptotically flat space , for the case of the regular action ; but here we find that we are able to establish solutions which fulfil the same conditions which guaranteed stability in the case of @xmath4 .",
    "this would be very enlightening to investigate .",
    "in addition , there is the issue of extending this work to higher dimensions , though due to the fact that we would now be dealing with essentially @xmath668 principal bundle automorphisms for the isometry group of @xmath669 , and the higher order cherns - simons terms in the action needed to obtain finite - mass solutions @xcite , this is likely to be highly technical .",

    "it is known that for black hole models there are observables in the dual cft which are sensitive to the presence of hair ( see @xcite for a discussion of non - abelian solutions in the context of ads / cft ) , and correspondences to cmp problems have been found relating to both superconductors @xcite and superfluids @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible that within the class of models considered in this paper , there exist many more applications to qft phenomena , and this could be a rich and worthwhile vein of study .",
    "the author would like to express great thanks to dr t. oliynyk ( monash university , melbourne , australia ) for a very useful email exchange .    ' '' ''"

    "<S> we investigate the existence of black hole and soliton solutions to four dimensional , anti - de sitter ( ads ) , einstein - yang - mills theories with general semisimple connected and simply connected gauge groups , concentrating on the so - called _ regular _ case . </S>",
    "<S> we here generalise results for the asymptotically flat case , and compare our system with similar results from the well - researched ads @xmath0 system . </S>",
    "<S> we find the analysis differs from the asymptotically flat case in some important ways : the biggest difference is that for @xmath1 , solutions are much less constrained as @xmath2 , making it possible to prove the existence of global solutions to the field equations in some neighbourhood of existing trivial solutions , and in the limit of @xmath3 . in particular , we can identify non - trivial solutions where the gauge field functions have no zeroes , which in the @xmath4 case proved important to stability .    _ keywords _ : hairy black holes , solitons , semisimple gauge group , anti - de sitter , einstein - yang - mills theory , existence + </S>"
