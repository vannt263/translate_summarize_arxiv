    "experimental @xcite and numerical @xcite studies of the dynamics of driven disordered media , such as vortex arrays in type - ii superconductors and charge density waves in metals , have clearly indicated that when the disorder is strong these systems exhibit a spatially inhomogeneous plastic response upon depinning , without long wavelength elastic restoring forces @xcite . in this",
    "plastic regime dislocations proliferate due to the interplay of drive , disorder and interactions , and the system is broken up in fluid - like regions flowing around solid regions @xcite .",
    "it was proposed recently @xcite that a description of shear deformations in this plastic regime may be obtained by focusing on the dynamics of coarse - grained degrees of freedom ( the solid - like regions ) and replacing the elastic couplings of local displacements with viscoelastic couplings of local velocities .",
    "it was found that the simplest , maxwell , model of viscoelasticity yields interesting features , such hysteretic depinning and switching , which have also been observed in experiments .",
    "the local viscoelastic couplings were introduced as an ad hoc way of mimicking the presence in the system at any given time of unbound dislocations , whose motion is in turn responsible for plastic slip .    in this paper",
    "we provide some justification to the model studied in ref . by showing that the dynamics of a two - dimensional crystal with a finite concentration of _ annealed _ free dislocations , as well as vacancy and interstitial defects , is governed by the hydrodynamic equations of a viscoelastic medium ( with hexatic order ) . starting with the hydrodynamic equations for a two - dimensional solid with finite concentrations of dislocations , vacancies and interstitials obtained some time ago by zippelius , halperin and nelson @xcite ( zhn )",
    ", we show that such equations can be recast in the form of hydrodynamic equations for a viscoelastic medium , with a maxwell form for the nonlocal transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "it has of course long been recognized that the creation and motion of dislocations are the main mechanism by which a crystal undergoes plastic deformations @xcite .",
    "a number of efforts @xcite have been made to describe the motion of dislocations through crystalline solids and relate the plastic strain rate to the dislocation dynamics .",
    "there has also been work specifically on the effect of dislocation motion on linear and nonlinear stress relaxation in a two - dimensional crystal @xcite , where it was shown _ for a particular geometry _ that the crystal responds viscoelastically when free dislocations are present .",
    "our work generalizes this by obtaining equations that describe the viscoelastic response of a two - dimensional solid to stresses in an _ arbitrary geometry_. the equations incorporate viscoelastic effects in the response to both shear and compressional deformations , and have precisely the structure of the viscoelastic equations for a simple viscous fluid @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our derivation yields expressions for the ( maxwell ) relaxation times for shear and compression in terms of microscopic parameters .    of course ,",
    "in the presence of _ quenched _ disorder and drive , dislocations are continuously generated and healed in the system .",
    "furthermore , they are not always free to move and relax a local stress as they may be pinned by disorder . for these reasons",
    "one may question the assumption behind the model introduced in ref .",
    ", namely that the plastic response of extended media driven over strong quenched disorder at zero temperature may be described at large scale by the same equation that govern the stress relaxation due to the motion of annealed dislocations . at best , the effective density of `` free '' dislocations that can relax local stresses will be a strong function of the applied driving force , disorder , and possibly time .",
    "as shown in ref . , the depinning of a driven viscoelastic medium does , however , exhibit a number of features seen in experiments , namely memory effects and coexistence of weakly and strongly pinned degrees of freedom .",
    "it does , therefore provide a useful starting model for the description of the complex dynamics of these systems .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that crystals with annealed dislocations and simple viscous fluids are not the only examples of viscoelastic media .",
    "linear viscoelasticity is of course one of the distinctive properties of complex and polymeric fluids , that can fill containers of any shape and yet may shrink like rubber when stretched and released quickly .",
    "molecular theories of viscoelasticity for complex fluids have been developed by various methods and there is a vast literature on the subject @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a dense fluid has insufficient time to flow in response to a high frequency strain rate , but instead reacts elastically , as a solid would @xcite .",
    "this leads to the appearance in the fluid of propagating shear waves , with an associated peak at nonzero frequency in the spectrum of transverse current fluctuations .",
    "such viscoelastic effects are easily incorporated phenomenologically into the hydrodynamic description of fluids @xcite .",
    "if a shearing force is applied to a fluid yielding a stress @xmath0 , the local strain at each point can be expressed in terms of derivatives of the displacement field @xmath1 at that point . in a steady - state situation",
    "the flow is purely viscous and the stress is proportional to the local rate of strain , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the shear viscosity . by contrast , if the force is applied suddenly , the instantaneous displacement is related to the stress via a typical elastic stress - strain relation , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the instantaneous ( high - frequency ) shear modulus .",
    "an interpolation between these two forms yields the maxwell model of viscoelasticity , where the stress - strain rate relation takes the form of a differential equation , @xmath6 the local flow velocity , @xmath7 , of the constituent particles is identified as the rate of change of the displacement , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is called the maxwell relaxation time .",
    "the maxwell model of viscoelasticity given by eq .",
    "( [ maxwell ] ) yields elastic response to high frequency shearing forces ( @xmath10 ) and viscous response at low frequency ( @xmath11 ) .    in general ,",
    "viscoelastic effects are present in the response to both shear and compression and can be described by modifying the hydrodynamic equations of a fluid by introducing nonlocal ( in space and time ) thermodynamic quantities and transport coefficients .",
    "this can be done phenomenologically through the use of frequency sum rules as constraints , or can be formulated more systematically by deriving such equations via formal projection operator methods or kinetic theory techniques @xcite . in its simplest realization",
    "this approach yields the maxwell model of viscoelasticity .    in this paper",
    "we show that the hydrodynamic equations for a two - dimensional solid with a finite concentration of free dislocations proposed by zhn are equivalent to a set of hydrodynamic equations for a simple fluid ( with hexatic order ) , with a maxwell - type stress - rate of strain relation . for convenience ,",
    "we define a symmetrized strain rate , @xmath12 , as @xmath13 where we have separated the traceless part @xmath14 and the trace @xmath15 .",
    "it is also useful to separate the stress tensor @xmath16 into its traceless part and its trace , i.e. , @xmath17 we find that , at long wavelengths , the traceless part of the stress tensor is related to the strain rate according to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the shear relaxation time , which is obtained in terms of microscopic parameters ( see eq .",
    "( [ tau_s ] ) below ) .",
    "equation ( [ sigmatilde_ij ] ) is precisely of the maxwell form . if the product @xmath20 is identified with the shear viscosity @xmath3 of the fluid , eq .",
    "( [ sigmatilde_ij ] ) yields viscous flow in response to low frequency shearing forces .",
    "it also describes the fact that a liquid always flows in response to a steady shear .",
    "in contrast , even a liquid has a finite low frequency compressional modulus , that is , it resists elastically low frequency compressional deformations .",
    "the trace of the stress tensor , @xmath21 , contains both reversible contributions proportional to pressure changes arising ( assuming temperature fluctuations are negligible ) from the fractional change in volume and irreversible and dissipative contributions proportional to velocity gradients .",
    "it can be written as @xmath22 with @xmath23 the deviation of the density from its equilibrium value @xmath24 , and @xmath25 the low frequency bulk modulus of the solid ( which generally depends on the density of vacancies and interstitials defects ) . to a good approximation",
    "@xmath25 is also the compressibility of the liquid phase @xcite .",
    "we find that the dissipative part @xmath26 of the stress tensor is related to the local rate of strain via the equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the high frequency compressional modulus of the solid in the absence of defects . at high frequency defects do not have time to respond to an applied force and therefore do not contribute to the elastic constants .",
    "finally , @xmath29 is the compressional relaxation time , which again is given below in terms of microscopic quantities .",
    "both relaxation times , @xmath19 and @xmath29 are inversely proportional to the density of free dislocations , @xmath30 . as a result , they both diverge as the melting temperature @xmath31 of the two - dimensional solid is approached from above as @xcite @xmath32 with @xmath33 . at the longest length scales , the bulk viscoelasticity described by eq .",
    "( [ sigma_kk^ve ] ) is due solely to dislocation _ climb _",
    ", while the shear viscoelasticity is due to both dislocation climb and _ glide_. dislocation climb which requires the creation of vacancies and interstitials , proceeds more slowly than dislocation glide which does not involve a change in particle number .",
    "for this reason , @xmath34 , in general .    of course ,",
    "the 2d solid does not melt directly into a isotropic liquid at @xmath31 , rather it enters the hexatic phase , where it has only short - ranged translational order , but retains quasi - long - ranged bond orientational order ( boo ) . at the longest length scales",
    ", the presence of boo does not affect the stress - rate of strain relations .",
    "when terms of higher order in the gradients of the hydrodynamic fields are included , the existence of boo becomes apparent and modifies the stress - strain rate relations at finite length scales , as discussed in section [ grad2 ] below .",
    "in particular , this gives wavevector - dependent corrections to @xmath19 and @xmath29 , corresponding to a distribution of relaxation times .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ review ]",
    "we review the hydrodynamic equations for a two - dimensional solid with vacancy and interstitial defects @xcite . in section [ grad1 ] the viscoelastic stress - rate of strain relations",
    "are derived in the longest length scale regime , and expressions for the long - wavelength viscoelastic memory times are presented . in section [ grad2 ] the effects of incorporating higher",
    "order gradients are investigated , including the wavevector dependent corrections to @xmath19 .",
    "we begin by reviewing the hydrodynamics of the solid phase , following refs .  , and .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional hexagonal crystal with a finite density of vacancies and interstitials . as pointed out by martin @xcite , incorporating a finite density of point defects is crucial to properly distinguish between local lattice deformations and local changes in the number density . for simplicity ,",
    "temperature fluctuations are neglected in all of the following .    in the absence of dislocations ,",
    "the equations for conservation of density , @xmath35 , momentum , @xmath36 , and net defect density , @xmath37 , i.e. , density of interstitials minus density of vacancies , and the equation of motion for the displacement field , @xmath38 , can be written as    @xmath39    [ xtalhdyro ]    where @xmath40 is the mass of the constituent particles and @xmath24 is the average number density .",
    "these conservation laws must be completed with constitutive equations for the two fluxes , the momentum flux or stress tensor , @xmath41 , and the defect current , @xmath42 .",
    "assuming purely relaxational dynamics for the defects , @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a constant kinetic coefficient and @xmath46 is the defect pressure , @xmath47 with @xmath48 a susceptibility proportional to the sum of the equilibrium densities of vacancies and interstitials , and @xmath49 a constant associated with the coupling between changes in defect density and bulk distortions in the lattice .",
    "the constitutive relation for the stress tensor , @xmath16 , is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the symmetric part of the strain tensor @xmath52 , given by @xmath53 the coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath54 are the lam constants .",
    "we note that the equilibrium bulk modulus , @xmath25 , of the solid is defined in terms of the response to a static isotropic compression as @xmath55^{-1}$ ] , with @xmath56 the area of the crystal . in the presence of defects it",
    "is then given by @xmath57 on the other hand , if one were to measure the bulk modulus on time scales long compared to the elastic relaxation time , but short compared to the defect diffusion time , the effective bulk modulus , denoted by @xmath28 , would be @xmath58 corresponding to the purely elastic contribution obtained in the absence of defects . in a finite - frequency measurements , the value @xmath59 is reached at sufficiently high frequency .",
    "finally , changes in the defect density can be related to changes in the overall density and bulk strains in the lattice , as @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the deviations of the density and defect density from their equilibrium values , respectively .    in the presence of dislocations",
    ", it is no longer possible to define a continuous single - valued displacement field , @xmath1 .",
    "one can define a single - valued , but discontinuous displacement field by introducing cuts at the location of the dislocations .",
    "the strain field @xmath63 is still single valued and continuous , except at the location of the dislocations , and it satisfies @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the lattice spacing , @xmath66 the antisymmetric unit tensor , and @xmath67 is the burgers - vector charge density . for a set of @xmath68 free dislocations at discrete points @xmath69 , @xmath70 , with burgers vector @xmath71 , it is given by @xmath72 dislocations are assumed to be annealed and free to equilibrate .",
    "the burgers vector charge density is an extra hydrodynamic variable with a conservation law , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the burgers current of the @xmath75th component of dislocation charge in the @xmath76th direction . for length scales",
    "longer than the average distance between free dislocations , @xmath77 , and time scales longer than the mean collision time between free dislocations , one can make some simplifying approximations .",
    "specifically , one can ignore the effect of dynamical polarization of bound dislocation pairs and also processes by which neutral dislocations pairs ( i.e. , dislocation pairs of opposite burgers vectors ) are created and annihilated .",
    "it was then shown in ref .",
    ", that the constitutive relation for the burgers current can be written as @xmath78 the three terms on the right hand side of eq .",

    "the conservation laws for density and momentum , eqs .",
    "( [ n ] ) and ( [ g ] ) , remain unchanged in the presence of dislocations .",
    "a new term must , however , be added to the equation for the conservation of defect density , reflecting the fact that a climbing dislocation acts as a source or sink of vacancies and interstitials .",
    "equation ( [ n_delta ] ) is then replaced by @xmath84 since @xmath1 is multi - valued , it is more convenient to consider an equation of motion for the strain rather than eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) for the displacement field .",

    "the work by zhn focused on the transverse and longitudinal hydrodynamic modes of these equations .",
    "these authors showed that the low frequency modes of a solid with dislocations are the same as those of the hexatic phase .",
    "in contrast , our goal here is to eliminate the dislocations and defects degrees of freedom and obtain a closed set of hydrodynamic equations for the density , momentum density and bond angle . by this procedure we show that the hydrodynamic equations of a solid with free dislocations are equivalent , at long wavelengths , to the hydrodynamic equations of a viscoelastic medium with bond angle order .",

    "our strategy is to eliminate the defect density , @xmath87 , and the burgers - vector charge density , @xmath88 , from the hydrodynamic equations of a solid with dislocations discussed in the previous section .",
    "the outcome will be a closed set of equations for density , momentum density , bond angle field and stress tensor .",
