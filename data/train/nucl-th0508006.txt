    "the pioneering work of weinberg  @xcite launched the basis for the effective field theory ( eft ) of nuclear forces starting from the expansion of an effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "it gives a nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction which is , in leading order , the one - pion - exchange potential ( opep ) plus a dirac - delta .",
    "the program of applying effective field methods to the nn system was pursued by many authors with significative results in few - nucleon systems ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in a more general context of few - body systems ,",
    "short range interactions have many applications which are discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "more recently , the authors of @xcite and @xcite treat the one - pion - exchange potential ( opep ) plus derivative dirac - delta interactions using dimensional and boundary condition regularizations , respectively .",
    "in particular , when comparing the theoretical approach with the data  @xcite , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the leading order interaction , opep plus a dirac - delta , renormalized using subtracted scattering equations , dominates the results obtained for the @xmath1 phase - shifts and mixing parameter .",
    "however , considering only the leading - order term , the results obtained for the @xmath0 phase shift are not satisfactory .",
    "this is an evidence that higher order terms in the effective interaction are important in this channel ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the fit of the @xmath0 phase - shift up to laboratory momentum @xmath2  mev / c requires an effective nn interaction with the addition of a term with second order derivatives of the dirac - delta . in the relative momentum space , we have @xmath3 where the @xmath4 s are unregulated strengths and @xmath5 is a matrix element of the one - pion - exchange potential . the motivation of the second term of ( [ veft ] ) is to simulate effects of heavy particle exchanges by a sum of a dirac - delta interaction and its derivatives , while keeping the ope as the long range part of the interaction . in the renormalization method described in @xcite ,",
    "we include @xmath6 , as the method is based on a kernel - subtraction procedure that generates terms of the type @xmath7 in the scattering matrix elements even when one considers only @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the interaction .",
    "in fact , the method also generates higher - order derivatives terms when ope is considered . in the weinberg counting rule scheme ,",
    "the derivative contact interactions we are considering comes along with the two - pion - exchange ( tpe )  @xcite .",
    "for a recent calculation in the nn system considering tpe see e.g. ref .  @xcite . as an exploratory calculation , in the present work",
    "we consider only the contact terms , leaving tpe for a future work .    in the scattering equation ,",
    "the effective bare potential  ( [ veft ] ) produces integrals that diverge as much as @xmath10 .",
    "therefore it is necessary at least three subtractions in the kernel of the lippman - schwinger ( ls ) equation , since each subtraction introduces a factor of @xmath11 . differently from the recent works",
    "@xcite and @xcite , we implement the method of subtracted scattering equations  @xcite to deal with this problem .",
    "the subtraction method has also been shown to be practical in providing renormalization group invariant solutions for three - body scattering equations with contact interactions  @xcite , and also proved to be useful in describing the halo structure of weakly bound exotic light nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the one - subtracted scattering equation used in our previous work  @xcite was generalized in  @xcite to allow any order of subtraction , permitting the inclusion of derivatives of the contact interaction in the effective two - body potential .",
    "the driving term of the n - subtracted ls equation is constructed recursively , renormalizing the model at each subtraction order , while keeping renormalization group invariance of the approach ( for details see  @xcite ) .    in the present work ,",
    "we obtain the @xmath0 nucleon - nucleon amplitude from the effective interaction ( [ veft ] ) , using a three - times subtracted scattering equation , as demanded by the higher divergent term of the type @xmath10 .",
    "we perform an analysis of the physical contribution coming from each order term in the recursive order - by - order renormalization procedure .",
    "it this way we access their significance in the parameterization of the effective interaction to obtain the desired observables .",
    "we should note that the contact interactions that we are considering are obviously meaningless without regularization and renormalization due to the generated ultraviolet divergences in the lippman - schwinger equation .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss the subtraction method applied to opep . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the main formulas of the recursive subtraction method to treat the scattering equation , as well as our strategy to solve it . in section 4 ,",
    "we show numerical results for the singlet phase - shift with our conclusion .",
    "the partial wave decomposition of opep for the @xmath0 state is  @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the relative momentum .",
    "the regular part of ope has a finite scattering matrix , solution of the partial - wave projected ls equation : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the second term in the right - hand side of ( [ sing ] ) .",
    "the t - matrix of the one - pion - exchange plus the dirac - delta potential  @xcite is obtained here using distorted wave theory  @xcite as suggested in @xcite : @xmath17 t_\\delta(e ) \\left[1+g^{(+)}_0(e)t_{\\pi}(e ) \\right ] \\ , \\label{tpivw1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18^{-1}$ ] is the free green s function with @xmath19 in the two - nucleon rest - frame , and @xmath20 the green s function for the regular part of the pion - exchange interaction is @xmath21    the direct solution of ( [ tpivw2 ] ) is plagued by infinities in the momentum integration . in order to get finite solution within our scheme we reformulate ( [ tpivw2 ] ) in a subtracted fashion , where only one subtraction is enough  @xcite .",
    "let us briefly explain the subtraction method  @xcite discussing the treatment of potentials where the matrix elements behave as a constant in the ultraviolet momentum region , like in ( [ tpivw2 ] ) , which needs one subtraction to allow finite results for the t - matrix .    using the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath22 = [ 1+t(e)g^{(+)}_0(e)]v   \\ , \\label{rtv1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the potential @xmath23 can be formally written in terms of the t - matrix at a certain energy @xmath24 as @xmath25^{-1}t(-\\mu^2 ) \\ . \\label{rv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for convenience we use a negative energy for the subtraction such that the green s function is real .",
    "> from ( [ rv ] ) and ( [ rtv1 ] ) we obtain the one - subtracted scattering equation : @xmath26    by introducing a convenient notation , which is useful for more subtractions , the driving term of ( [ rt1v0 ] ) is denoted as @xmath27 .",
    "a subtracted free green function is written as @xmath28 which allows to rewrite the renormalized t - matrix equation  ( [ rt1v0 ] ) as @xmath29 for a dirac - delta potential , ( [ rt10 ] ) produces finite results once @xmath30 is given . in this simple case ,",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath30 in the relative momentum representation is just the renormalized coupling constant .",
    "the method of subtracted equations is easily applied to ( [ tpivw2 ] ) , and one should note that the free green s function in ( [ rt10 ] ) is being replaced by the interacting one , @xmath31 .",
    "we obtain the t - matrix for an arbitrary energy @xmath32 in terms of the t - matrix at a given energy scale @xmath24 : @xmath33    the renormalized strength of the interaction defines @xmath34 at the subtraction point , @xmath35 , which is enough to get a finite amplitude for the opep plus a dirac - delta at this energy : @xmath36\\lambda_{\\mathcal { r}00 } \\left[1+\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int^\\infty_0dq'~{q'}^2 \\frac{t_{\\pi}(q',p;-\\mu^2)}{-\\mu^2-{q'}^2 } \\right ] \\ , \\label{tpivw3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the t - matrix for the regular part of the one - pion - exchange potential in the @xmath0 channel is given by eq .",
    "( [ tpifinal ] ) .",
    "the scattering t - matrix is not finite for the bare effective potential ( [ veft ] ) , which imply that regularization and renormalization are required to define the scattering amplitude .",
    "the method we use consists in constructing regularized and renormalized scattering equations with propagators subtracted at certain scales , which are convenient for introducing the physical inputs .",
    "our motivation in using the subtracted method was to treat a bare potential that includes a regular part plus the dirac - delta interaction and its derivatives , for which the t - matrix has a definite form for a certain @xmath37 .",
    "that given , no approximations are performed in getting the scattering amplitude .",
    "let us consider point - like interactions that include up to four terms , a contact interaction plus its derivatives .",
    "after partial - wave decomposition to the singlet @xmath38wave state , the bare potential is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 corresponds to the regular part of opep plus a dirac - delta interaction @xmath41 .    in order to calculate the scattering amplitude for the bare potential ( [ vefts ] ) with subtracted equations ,",
    "the strategy is the following .",
    "first one has to define the starting point of the iterative procedure to get the driving term of the subtracted equation . in the present case",
    ", at least three subtractions are required to allow a finite result for the the t - matrix , and two iterations are consequently needed to get the driving term .",
    "the iterative process begins with the t - matrix of ope plus dirac - delta potentials ( [ tpivw3 ] ) , leading to one subtraction in the kernel ( @xmath42 ) , as shown in section 2 .",
    "next , as we show in the following subsection , two iterations are performed and added the amplitude @xmath43 at the subtraction scale ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the renormalized strengths of the interaction ) .",
    "a three - fold subtracted t - matrix equation has to be used to define the scattering amplitude of the effective potential ( [ vefts ] ) , which in operator form and for a general number of subtractions @xmath46 reads  @xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48^{-1}v^{(n-1)}(-\\mu^2;e)\\ ; , \\label{vn } \\\\ g^{(+)}_n(e;-\\mu^2)&\\equiv&\\left[(-\\mu^2-e)g_0(-\\mu^2)\\right]^n g^{(+)}_0(e ) .",
    "\\label{gn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one should note that the form of the above equation with @xmath42 when applied to three - body systems results in the subtracted form used in @xcite , where the boundary condition was taken at the scattering threshold .",
    "the recursive formula to derive the driving term @xmath49 starts from @xmath50 given by ( [ tpivw3 ] ) .",
    "so far , only the opep and the dirac - delta interactions have been introduced in the calculation .",
    "the higher order derivatives of the dirac - delta potential in ( [ vefts ] ) are introduced in the driving term of the three - fold subtracted equation .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath51 for the full effective interaction of ( [ vefts ] ) in the angular momentum basis , @xmath52 get the contribution from the derivatives of the dirac - delta interaction , through the values of @xmath53 - the renormalized strengths of the corresponding terms in the potential .",
    "the integral equations for the matrix elements , @xmath54 , are @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "the explicit form of the three - fold subtracted ls equation is : @xmath57 in the angular momentum basis the scattering amplitude is @xmath58 and the low - energy parameters are defined by the effective range expansion @xmath59 with @xmath60 the scattering length and @xmath61 the effective range .",
    "we observe that in our method the kernel is subtracted at a given scale which allows to perform the momentum integrals up to infinity , in that sense the subtracted equations are automatically regularized . in the cutoff regularization ,",
    "the hilbert space is truncated and intermediate states goes up to a given momentum scale , such that the effective interaction includes the effect of the neglected states  @xcite .",
    "our method softens the contribution of the higher momentum intermediate states , with the partially removed physics parameterized through the driving term . of course we could move the subtraction scale , at the expense of a more complicated form for the driving term",
    "this fact also happens in a cut - off regularization when the cut - off is moved  @xcite .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon observables are invariant under the change of the arbitrary subtraction point , therefore one can start at any convenient energy scale @xmath62 . however , the form of the driving term and its coefficients in ( [ vrenfinal ] ) which define the scattering amplitude are tied to the prescription used to define the renormalized theory .",
    "the key point of the renormalization group method is to change this prescription without altering the predictions of the theory  @xcite .",
    "the invariance of the t - matrix under changes of renormalization prescriptions imposes a definite rule to modify @xmath63 in ( [ tren ] ) , which appears in a form of a non - relativistic callan - symanzik ( nrcs ) equation  @xcite : @xmath64 derived from ( [ tren ] ) and @xmath65 .",
    "equation  ( [ ss3 ] ) substantiate the invariance of the renormalized t - matrix under dislocation of the subtraction point , with the boundary condition given by ( [ vrenfinal ] ) .",
    "then , we observe that there is a non - trivial dependence on the subtraction point appearing in the driving term of the subtracted scattering equation , although the physical results of the model are kept unchanged .",
    "the solution of ( [ ss3 ] ) implies in a complicated evolution of @xmath63 as @xmath66 changes .",
    "not only the lambda s would change , but also the form of the driving term .",
    "the ultraviolet behavior of the driving term is not changed by the evolution in @xmath66 .",
    "the evolution should not be truncated as @xmath66 is varied to keep the t - matrix invariant . at different",
    "@xmath66 the potential @xmath67 has a complicate form from the solution of nrcs equation .",
    "similarly , the evolution of renormalization group equations as introduced by bogner , kuo and schwenk  @xcite for the nn scattering does not truncate on certain operators as the cutoff is varied to keep observables unchanged .",
    "the renormalized strengths @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath45 and the subtracion point @xmath66 are found by fitting some low - energy phase shift data . for each set of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath66 , we fit the singlet scattering length @xmath70  fm through the value of @xmath68 .",
    "the three parameters left are adjusted to reproduce the nijgemen data  @xcite up to the center of mass momentum @xmath13 of about 300  mev / c .",
    "we get an effective range of @xmath71  fm compared with the value of 2.68  fm from ref .",
    "the parameters found are displayed in table  [ tab1 ] , where @xmath72  mev / c corresponds to a negative subtraction energy point @xmath73 - 50 mev .",
    "we emphasize that the results for the scattering length shown in the table correspond to the values obtained considering only the parameters found from the best fit of the singlet phase - shift using eq.([vrenfinal ] ) as input for the three - fold subtracted scattering equation ( [ trenfinal ] ) .",
    "of course , from pionless eft , we know that one could adjust the scattering length and the singlet phase - shifts at very low - energies with only contact interactions .",
    "first , we show in figure  [ fig1 ] the results of our method for only @xmath74 for the singlet and triplet channels using the one - fold subtracted t - matrix equations as performed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we have used @xmath75 it is worth to mention that , for @xmath76 , @xmath77 . in the present framework",
    ", we are using directly as input @xmath78 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ tpivw3 ] ) and ( [ vrenfinal ] ) ) .",
    "the large values of @xmath66 in fig . [ fig1 ] arise due to the choice given by eq .",
    "( [ v1pd ] ) .",
    "we observe that the large @xmath66 limit converges . for the singlet channel ,",
    "@xmath40 is not enough to describe the data .",
    "however , the approach works reasonably well in the spin - triplet channel when we consider eq .",
    "( [ v1pd ] ) for the coupled channels with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , we will not consider the spin - triplet channel further in the present work where we focus on the huge discrepancy of the singlet channel .",
    "we leave a detailed analysis of the coupled channels for a future work , where we also intend to include the two - pion - exchange interaction .",
    "in figure  [ fig2 ] we present the results obtained when we include @xmath84 . in order to evaluate the contributions of the different terms in the effective potential for the parameters of the best fit displayed in table i",
    ", we calculate the @xmath0 phase shifts for the individual contributions of @xmath85 , @xmath41 and @xmath84 , as well as for the combinations @xmath86 , @xmath40 and @xmath87 . below @xmath88  mev / c the different calculations presents results that underestimate the data due to the fact that @xmath89 23.7  fm , especially for @xmath85 and @xmath40 , while for @xmath84 and @xmath86 @xmath90 is better approximated ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) . in the last two cases , as the short - range part of the effective interaction is dominated by the higher - order derivatives of the dirac - delta , the calculation is about enough to describe the phase shifts above @xmath91  mev / c .",
    "therefore , the most relevant contribution in this channel comes from @xmath86 , while the regular part of the pion exchange potential appears at low energies as it provides the long range part of the potential .",
    "although our approach is rg invariant , it is not simple to explicitly incorporate rg invariance in the driving term of the three - fold subtracted equations . in order to have an insight of the effects included by the evolution of the driving term through the cs equation , it is important to study how our fit depends on @xmath66 . for this purpose",
    ", we calculate the phase shifts for values of @xmath66 around the best - fit value ( @xmath92 ) keeping the @xmath4 s intact , as shown in fig .",
    "we observe that , at very low momenta the fit is not affected . for higher momenta ,",
    "the phase shifts present a monotonic behaviour : it increases ( decreases ) as @xmath66 gets larger ( smaller ) .",
    "the use of the nrcs equation ( [ ss3 ] ) would cancel this effect in order to keep the t - matrix , and thus the observables , invariant .      in conclusion ,",
    "we show in this letter how to apply the subtracted scattering equations  @xcite to the nn singlet channel , when more than one subtraction is required to renormalize the corresponding interaction .",
    "the approach consists of a regularization of the integrand of the original scattering equation by using a given subtraction procedure in the propagator at some energy scale with where the t - matrix is known .",
    "the subtraction scale can be moved without modifying the calculated observables once the inhomogeneous term of the subtracted scattering equation runs with the scale according to the non - relativistic callan - symanzik ( nrcs ) equation .",
    "in the present case , the boundary condition is determined by the renormalized coupling constants and by the t - matrix of the ope and dirac - delta potentials at the specified value of the subtraction point . as a final remark ,",
    "the subtracted scattering equation method is recursive and can be easily extended when higher order derivatives of the dirac - delta are present in the two - body effective interaction .",
