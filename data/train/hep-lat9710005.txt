    "there are many approaches to formulating a discrete theory of quantum gravity . in this talk",
    "i will focus on the dynamical triangulations ( dt ) formulation of simplicial gravity .",
    "this was first developed in the context of string theory and two - dimensional quantum gravity ( @xmath1 ) where the discrete approach has proven extremely powerful and actually preceded continuum treatments . by now we have considerable confidence in the validity of the assumptions underlying the dt model in the case of coupling of matter with central charge c less than one .",
    "this confidence stems from the agreement of discrete , continuum and numerical results .",
    "the situation for central charge c greater than one was clarified in the last year by david @xcite .",
    "after the introduction a discussion of this work will be the first part of this review .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of recent numerical tests of david s proposal @xcite .",
    "i will then move on to the fascinating issue of the intrinsic fractal geometry of @xmath1 and @xmath1 coupled to conformal matter . in any theory of gravity",
    "it is natural to ask what effect quantum fluctuations have on the structure of spacetime .",
    "the most basic question we could ask of any spacetime with a given topology is : `` what is its hausdorff dimension ? ''",
    "our current knowledge of the answer to this question will be reviewed , with emphasis on a comparison of analytic predictions with recent numerical simulations .",
    "the success of the dt approach to simplicial gravity in two dimensions has inspired several groups to tackle large scale simulations of the dt discretization of euclidean einstein - hilbert gravity in 3 and 4 dimensions .",
    "here the situation is much cloudier , both theoretically and numerically .",
    "the current status will be summarized in the third part of my talk .",
    "any rich idea usually has many unsuspected spin - offs .",
    "the field of random surfaces and non - critical string theory is intimately connected with the physics of membranes .",
    "some recent numerical results on new phases of anisotropic membranes will be discussed as an example of the fascinating interdisciplinary nature of the subject of random surfaces .",
    "finally i present a list of challenging future problems that i think are essential for progress in the field .",
    "i hope that some of them will be solved by the time of lattice 98 .",
    "string theories may be viewed as 2-dimensional euclidean quantum field theories with particular actions and matter content . from this viewpoint",
    "they may also be considered as 2d - statistical mechanical models on lattices with dynamical geometry .",
    "statistical mechanical models on fixed lattices often possess special critical points where they are scale invariant .",
    "correlation functions of generic matter fields @xmath2 reflect this scale invariance by transforming very simply under scale transformations : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the scaling dimension of @xmath5 , or equivalently its anomalous dimension in field theory . combining scale invariance with locality leads to the much larger symmetry of conformal invariance . in two dimensions",
    "conformal invariance and unitarity restrict the possible values of critical exponents because the unitarisable representations of the associated virasoro algebra form a discrete series parameterized by a single real number  the central charge @xmath6 .",

    "the linearity of @xmath12 with genus @xmath16 given by eq.([eq : gams ] ) has the remarkable consequence that the partition function including the sum over genus @xmath23 is actually a function not of two variables @xmath19 and @xmath24 but only of the single scaling combination @xmath25 for the minimal models of eq.([eq : minseries ] ) the scaling variable is    @xmath26    the discrete formulation of @xmath1 dates to 1982 and has proven to be even more powerful than the continuum approach @xcite .",
    "it is very rare in conventional field theories for the discrete formulation to be more flexible than the continuum treatment and the fact that it is so here certainly deserves notice .    in discrete @xmath1 one replaces the 2d - manifold @xmath27 by a set of @xmath28 discrete nodes @xmath29 and the metric @xmath30 by the adjacency matrix @xmath31 , where @xmath32 if @xmath33 is connected to @xmath34 and @xmath35 otherwise .",

    "this unphysical prediction is indicative of an instability in the model .",
    "what is the true character of the theory for @xmath53 ?",
    "the @xmath0 point is analogous to the upper critical dimension @xmath54 in the theory of phase transitions and , in fact , there are known logarithmic violations of scaling at c=1 @xcite .    from numerical simulations for @xmath53",
    "the following picture has emerged .",
    "two basic classes of models have been carefully investigated .",
    "the first consists of bosonic matter fields on dynamical triangulations . in these models",
    "one finds a branched polymer * bp * phase for @xmath6 large ( typically @xmath55 ) .",
    "the * bp * phase is characterized by @xmath56 and the proliferation of minimal neck baby universes ( mimbus ) . for smaller values of the central charge ( @xmath57 )",
    "the simulations indicate an intermediate phase with @xmath58 . there is no apparent discontinuity in the vicinity of @xmath0 .",

    "the transition from the magnetized pure gravity phase to the disordered * bp * phase is a branching transition with @xmath56 .",

    "similar phenomena are found for the q - state potts model for q large .",
    "a plot of @xmath12 as a function of the central charge @xmath6 from existing simulations for two classes of triangulations ( degenerate @xmath65 and combinatorial @xmath66 ) is shown in fig.[fig : gamc ] .",
    "= 2.8 in    could there be a nontrivial infrared fixed point governing the critical properties of the @xmath67 models ?",
    "a renormalization group scheme for matrix models , roughly analogous to the @xmath68-expansion about the upper critical dimension , was developed sometime ago by brzin and zinn - justin ( bz ) @xcite . a typical example is given by the @xmath69-matrix model formulation of the @xmath28-ising spins coupled to gravity .",
    "the bz technique consists of integrating out one row and one column of the matrix to obtain an @xmath70 dimensional matrix .",
    "changing @xmath71 is equivalent to changing the string coupling constant @xmath72 of eq.([eq : ident ] ) .",
    "this induces a flow in the matrix model coupling which leads to definite renormalization group flows .",

    "the method is only qualitatively correct for the well - understood case of @xmath7 minimal models but has the advantage it can be extended to @xmath53 . what does it tell us about @xmath53 ?",
    "david s idea was to apply the bz scheme to matrix models that include _ branching _ interactions .",
    "these interactions generate microscopic wormholes that connect two macroscopic pieces of a riemann surface .",
    "the action for such models is given by @xmath73 the trace - squared ( gluing ) interaction ( with coupling @xmath52 ) corresponds to branching and is naturally generated at second order in perturbation theory within a renormalization - group framework .",
    "such models were first treated by das et al .",

    "further work is highly desirable to consolidate the result that @xmath102 for @xmath114 is independent of the matter .",
    "the subtlety of the problem when ising matter is included may be seen in @xcite .",

    "since the dt approach to quantum gravity is very successful in two dimensions it is natural to explore its implications in higher dimensions .",
    "there has , in fact , been considerable effort in this direction in recent years .",

    "so far the majority of numerical results have been limited to the fixed topology of the sphere . to be specific",
    "let us concentrate on the @xmath119-dimensional case of the four - sphere @xmath125 .",
    "= 2.5 in    the free global variables at our disposal are the numbers @xmath126 of @xmath33-dimensional simplices in a given triangulation @xmath42 ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "these 5 parameters are constrained by two dehn - sommerville relations @xmath128 together with the euler relation @xmath129 these three relations leave two independent variables which we may take to be @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "these are the discrete analogues of the mean scalar curvature and the volume .",
    "the einstein - hilbert action eq.([eq : ehaction ] ) then becomes @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the discrete cosmological constant and @xmath134 is the discrete inverse newton s constant . in practice ( almost )",
    "fixed @xmath131 ( volume ) systems are usually simulated by adding a constraint that restricts the volume to be near a target volume .",
    "one is then really approximating the fixed volume partition function @xmath135 from extensive numerical simulations it has emerged that the system described by the partition function of eq.([eq : fixedvol ] ) has two distinct phases . for @xmath134 small ( strong coupling ) the system is crumpled ( infinite hausdorff dimension ) and the mean scalar curvature @xmath136 is negative .",
    "for @xmath134 large ( weak coupling ) the system is elongated ( branched - polymer like ) with hausdorff dimension 2 and positive mean scalar curvature of order the volume .",
    "in the crumpled phase generic triangulations contain one singular one - simplex with two singular vertices @xcite .",
    "these singular simplices are connected to an extensive fraction of the volume of the simplicial manifold .",
    "the local volume associated with the singular one - simplex grows like @xmath137 while the local volume associated with the singular vertices grows like @xmath138 itself .",
    "the appearance of singular structures is generic to simplicial dt gravity in dimensions @xmath139 . for @xmath139",
    "one finds a singular @xmath140 simplex ( with local volume of order @xmath137 ) and singular sub - simplices ( with local volume of order @xmath138 ) .",
    "it is now clearly established that there is a _",
    "first order _ phase transition connecting the crumpled phase with the branched polymer phase in both 3 @xcite and 4 dimensions @xcite .",
    "this is seen dramatically in the time series of monte carlo sweeps shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : firstorder ] @xcite .",
    "a finite - size scaling analysis of the variance of the @xmath130 ( or equivalently @xmath141 ) fluctuations also reveals a maximum which grows linearly with the system volume  a classic signal of a first - order transition .",
    "it requires both large volumes ( order @xmath142 ) and long simulations ( order @xmath143 sweeps ) to see the first order nature of the transition emerge clearly in four dimensions .",
    "it is also becoming clear that the transition itself is closely connected to the formation of the singular simplices @xcite .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : singvertex ] .",
    "many characteristics of the elongated phase are analogous to those of branched - polymers @xcite and may be reproduced by simple and elegant statistical mechanical models of branching @xcite . with a suitable choice of ensemble",
    "this class of models also possesses a discontinuous transition @xcite .",
    "thus the weak coupling phase of the theory may reflect more about the combinatorial nature of the simplicial dt action than about the nature of gravity itself .",
    "this remains to be seen .",
    "the lack of a continuous transition for dt simplicial gravity in higher dimensions has been a deterrent for recent progress in the field . from a traditional point of view",
    "this absence of a critical point implies that the model has no continuum limit we could call continuum quantum gravity .",
    "at least three viewpoints are possible at this stage .",
    "it may be that the theory is fundamentally discrete and that _ no _ continuum limit should be taken .",
    "this viewpoint is advocated in different ways in several other approaches to quantum gravity such as the causal sets formulation of sorkin @xcite and the theory of spin networks @xcite .",
    "alternatively the theory might only have an interpretation as an effective theory valid over a limited range of length scales .",
    "finally it may be that pure dt simplicial gravity is ill - defined but that models with appropriate matter or modified measures @xcite possess critical points and admit a suitable continuum limit .",
    "this latter approach was discussed in this meeting by izubuchi for @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "one modifies the action by adding terms that effectively enhance higher curvature fluctuations  these correspond to changing the measure locally by powers of @xmath145 .",
    "there is some evidence that by tuning this extra term one can soften the transition to a continuous one at finite volumes .",
    "it is very likely though that the effect disappears in the infinite - volume limit .",
    "this issue needs further clarification .",
    "the theory of random surfaces with the addition of an extrinsic curvature to the action has a direct connection with the statistical mechanics of flexible membranes @xcite .",
    "physical membranes are two - dimensional surfaces fluctuating in three embedding dimensions .",
    "the simplest examples of 2-dimensional surfaces are strictly planar systems called films or monolayers .",
    "these alone are surprisingly complex systems .",
    "but when they also have the freedom to fluctuate , or bend , in the embedding space it is a considerable challenge to determine their physical properties",
    ". two broad classes of membranes have been extensively studied .",
    "membranes with fixed connectivity ( bonds are never broken ) are known as crystalline or tethered membranes .",
    "membranes with dynamical connectivity ( relatively weak bonds which are free to break and rejoin ) are known as fluid membranes .",
    "the simplest action for self - intersecting ( non - self - avoiding ) fluid membranes resembles that of the polyakov string with extrinsic curvature ( bending energy ) . since the beta function for the inverse - bending rigidity ( where the bending rigidity is the coupling to the extrinsic curvature ) is well - known to be asymptotically free at one loop , the bending rigidity is irrelevant in the infrared and self - intersecting fluid membranes",
    "are commonly believed to exist only in a crumpled phase .",
    "crystalline membranes , on the other hand , have a non - linear coupling between elastic ( phonon ) interactions and bending fluctuations which drives a phase transition from a high - temperature crumpled phase to a low - temperature orientationally ordered ( flat ) phase .    much can be learned about membranes by applying the techniques and experience of lattice gravity simulations to these condensed matter / biological problems .",
    "this is illustrated by some recent @xcite large - scale monte carlo simulations of anisotropic crystalline membranes  these are systems in which the bending or elastic energies are different in different directions .",
    "we were able to verify for the first time the predicted existence @xcite of a novel _ tubular _ phase in this class of membranes .",
    "this phase is intermediate between the flat and crumpled phases  it is extended ( flat ) in one direction but crumpled in the transverse direction",
    ". correspondingly there are two phase transitions : the crumpled - to - tubular transition and the tubular - to - flat transition .",
    "thermalized configurations from the three phases of anisotropic crystalline membranes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tubules ] .",
    "these simulations employed a variety of improved monte carlo algorithms such as hybrid overrelaxation and unigrid methods @xcite .",
    "an even more challenging problem is to incorporate the self - avoidance found in realistic membranes @xcite .",
    "finally the full physics of fluid membranes , in which dynamical connectivity may be modeled by dynamical triangulations , is a problem of limitless challenges which ties together common techniques in lattice gravity and the burgeoning field of soft condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "there are many challenges facing the program of simplicial lattice gravity .",
    "i will give here a few outstanding problems and possible future directions .",
    "most of the numerical simulations in the field have been on spacetimes with fixed topology . from the functional integral point of view",
    "it is more natural ( and perhaps essential ) to allow the topology of spacetime to fluctuate . in @xmath147",
    "it is even possible to perform analytically the sum over all topologies in the double scaling limit .",
    "a preliminary investigation of a @xmath148 dynamical triangulation model of euclidean quantum gravity with fluctuating topology was made some time ago by de bakker @xcite .",
    "whether or not it has physical relevance it is clear that one of the most powerful ideas in particle physics / quantum field theory / string theory at present is supersymmetry .",
    "supersymmetry severely constrains the analytic structure of any model .",
    "almost no progress has been made in formulating or simulating supersymmetric simplicial gravity or supersymmetric random surfaces .",
    "if we are ever to make contact with critical or non - critical superstrings and recent developments like duality relations this will be essential .",
    "although simplicial quantum gravity does provide a non - perturbative definition of quantum gravity in four dimensions there is no understanding of how classical gravity emerges in the long - wavelength limit and indeed of how perturbative scattering amplitudes are reproduced in this framework .      at present",
    "there is no classification of the precise class of graphs that result in kpz , rather than onsager , critical exponents when matter is coupled to a dynamical lattice ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "for example it has been shown @xcite that mdt ( _ minimal dynamical triangulation _ ) models in which the local coordination number is restricted to be 5 , 6 or 7 still result in kpz exponents .",
    "what is the correct interpretation of @xmath148 simplicial quantum gravity given the first order transition from the strong to weak coupling phases ?",
    "what is the proper mathematical framework for @xmath149 and how much analytic progress can be made ?",
    "recent progress in this direction is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "recently renormalization group ( rg ) methods have been developed for pure simplicial gravity and for simple matter coupled to gravity @xcite .",
    "there is no rigorous understanding of the principles behind the success of these methods and further improvement of the technique is highly desirable .",
