    "in our recent research  @xcite , we extended the program of calculating higher order perturbative qcd corrections to the structure functions of charged current deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "our studies are motivated by the increasingly accurate measurements of neutral and charged current cross sections at hera with a polarized beam of electrons and positrons  @xcite . at the same time we are also able to quantitatively improve predictions for physics at the front - end of a neutrino - factory , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . to be specific ,",
    "we consider neutrino(@xmath0)-proton(@xmath1 ) scattering in the combination @xmath5 , which corresponds to charged lepton - proton dis as far as qcd corrections are concerned .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite we compute the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) predictions to three - loop accuracy for a number of fixed mellin moments of the structure functions @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    within the framework of the operator product expansion ( ope ) , and working in mellin space ,",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are functions of odd mellin moments only , while only even moments contribute to @xmath9 .",
    "this is opposite to the case of the neutral current structure functions where only even mellin moments contribute , and to the charged current case for @xmath10 scattering  @xcite , which is defined through the ope for odd mellin moments only . in the latter results for @xmath11 and @xmath12 to three - loops",
    "can also be directly checked in electromagnetic dis  @xcite while parameterizations for @xmath13 to three - loop accuracy are given in ref .",
    "we consider unpolarized inclusive deep - inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering , @xmath14 where @xmath15 are leptons of momenta @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 denotes a nucleon of momentum @xmath19 and @xmath20 stands for all hadronic states allowed by quantum number conservation . in our research",
    "we are concentrating on charged current neutrino(@xmath0)-proton(@xmath1 ) scattering , i.e. @xmath21 , @xmath22 via @xmath23 boson exchange .",
    "as is well known , the differential cross section for the reaction  ( [ eq : dis ] ) can be written as a product of leptonic @xmath24 and hadronic @xmath25 tensors @xmath26 with @xmath27 for electroweak or pure electromagnetic gauge boson exchange given in the literature , see e.g. ref .",
    "the hadronic tensor @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffcrosssec ] ) can be written in terms of so called structure functions @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "we are interested in the mellin moments of structure functions , defined as @xmath31 and for @xmath32 one has similar relation with @xmath33 replaced by @xmath34 on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mellindeff2l ] ) . here",
    "@xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the bjorken scaling variable defined as @xmath38 with @xmath39 .    with the help of the optical theorem and cauchys theorem from complex analysis",
    "one can relate the mellin moments of structure functions to the parameters of the ope for the nucleon forward compton amplitude @xmath40 : @xmath41 and the ope for @xmath40 reads as @xmath42 a_{{\\rm{nucl}}}^{\\rm ns}\\left(n,{\\mu^2}\\right )   + { \\rm{higher\\,\\ , twists } } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where higher twist contributions are omitted .",
    "@xmath43 denote the wilson coefficients which are calculable in pqcd and @xmath44 are matrix elements of quark non - singlet operators .",
    "the latter are not calculable in pqcd , rather they have to be extracted from experimental data .",
    "we restrict ourselves to quark non - singlet ( ns ) operators only since only these give nonvanishing contributions in the combination @xmath45 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "( [ eq : f2mellinmr ] ) provides the basis to obtain mellin moments of dis structure functions in our approach by means of the ope and the optical theorem .",
    "furthermore , from the careful examination of the symmetry properties of the forward compton amplitude @xmath40 and , related , the underlying feynman diagrams , one can convince oneself that for the charged current @xmath45 dis , one encounters functions of only odd @xmath33 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 and , functions of only even @xmath33 for @xmath4 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the pqcd calculation of wilson coefficients @xmath43 proceeds through the following steps . from the first principles we calculate the partonic forward compton amplitude @xmath46 .",
    "the partonic equivalent of the ope eq .",
    "( [ eq : openucl ] ) for @xmath46 contains the _ same _ coefficients @xmath43 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : openucl ] ) and quark matrix elements @xmath47 . projection on the @xmath33th mellin moment of ope and on the @xmath48th parton invariant ( @xmath30 ) with the help of the operator @xmath49 we get @xmath50 both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmunupartonmomns ] ) are renormalized .",
    "in particular the renormalization of the local quark operator matrix element @xmath47 gives rise to the factor @xmath51 on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : tmunupartonmomns ] ) .",
    "this equation is our starting point for an iterative determination of the coefficient functions @xmath43 and the anomalous dimension @xmath52 .",
    "the latter appears in a series expansion of @xmath53 in powers of the strong coupling @xmath54 and negative powers of the parameter @xmath55 of dimensional regularization , @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath43 on the other hand are expanded in @xmath54 and in positive powers of @xmath55 .",
    "thus the l.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmunupartonmomns ] ) leads to a well defined determination of @xmath43 and @xmath53 in pqcd .",
    "in the previous section , we have briefly explained the method to obtain mellin moments of the dis charged current structure functions @xmath57 , @xmath9 and @xmath58 together with their respective coefficient functions and anomalous dimensions . to that end",
    "we have calculated the lorentz invariants of the parton compton amplitude @xmath59 , @xmath30 , as given in the l.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : tmunupartonmomns ] ) . due to the large number of diagrams involved in the calculations up to order @xmath60 sufficient automatization",
    "is necessary .",
    "first of all , we have generated 3633 diagrams up to three loops with the program qgraf  @xcite .",
    "for all further calculations we have relied on the latest version of the symbolic manipulation program form  @xcite .    for the treatment of qgraf output , such as analysis of the topologies , the explicit implementation of feynman rules etc .",
    "we have adapted a dedicated form procedure _ conv.prc _ from previous work , e.g. ref .",
    "most importantly , this procedure tries to exploit as many symmetry properties of the original feynman diagrams as possible in order to reduce their total number .    for the calculation of the color factors for each feynman diagram we have used the form package _ color.h",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the actual calculation of the mellin moments of the feynman integrals has made use of the form version of mincer  @xcite .",
    "finally , on top of mincer and minos  @xcite some shell scripts managed the automatic runs of both programs for different parts of the calculation .",
    "we have performed various checks on our computation .",
    "most prominently , we have kept all powers of the gauge parameter @xmath61 throughout the entire calculation for mellin moments @xmath62 to check that any @xmath61-dependence vanishes in our final results .",
    "the mellin moments with @xmath63 were calculated without gauge parameter to facilitate the computations which become increasingly more complicated for higher mellin @xmath33 values . for these moments we also used tform  @xcite , the multi - threaded version of form . on machines with multi - core processors",
    "this leads to a significant speed up of our calculations , e.g. a speed - up of @xmath64 on a two - core four processor machine .",
    "we agree with the literature as far as the two - loop coefficient functions  @xcite and the three - loop anomalous dimensions  @xcite are concerned .",
    "in addition , for the first mellin moment of the coefficient function @xmath65 we have obtained exactly @xmath66 to all orders in @xmath54 which is in agreement with the adler sum rule for dis structure functions , @xmath67 the adler sum rule measures the isospin of the nucleon in the quark - parton model and does not receive any perturbative or non - perturbative corrections in qcd , see e.g. ref .",
    "therefore , this result is another important check of the correctness of our results .",
    "we have reported on new results for mellin moments of the charged current dis structure functions @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 including the perturbative qcd corrections to three loops . in the former case ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 )",
    "we have computed the first six odd - integer mellin moments while in the latter case ( @xmath4 ) , the first six even - integer moments have been obtained .",
    "the results for @xmath71 @xmath72 and for @xmath70 @xmath73 are available in ref .",
    "results for @xmath74 in the former case and for @xmath75 in the latter will be published elsewhere .",
    "finally , the discussion of phenomenological consequences of our mellin space results along with approximate parameterizations the coefficient functions in @xmath37 are deferred to ref ."
