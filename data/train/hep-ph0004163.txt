    "the purpose of the next section is to go beyond the second cluster approximation .",
    "taking into account the attractive parts of higher cluster terms is straightforward : assuming that the attractive interaction of three and more pions is dominated by resonance interaction ( as it was in the two pion case ) we just add the activities of all the lightest pion resonances to the grand canonical partition function logarithm : @xmath215 where the first term in the right hand side is the partition function of the ideal pion gas and the sum in the second term runs over not only the two pion resonances ( table [ respar ] ) , but also includes the resonances decaying into three and more pions ( table [ resparm ] ) . for the activity of each resonance species we use the following expression @xmath216",

    "( [ denspg ] ) .    to take into account the hard core repulsion between pions and resonances we use the excluded volume van der waals model @xcite . in the framework of this model",
    "the pressure @xmath229 of one - component gas of particles with the excluded - volume parameter @xmath230 can be found from the transcendental equation @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the pressure of corresponding ideal gas .",
    "the particle density @xmath233 is related to that of ideal gas by the expression @xmath234 the above model can be straightforwardly generalized to a multi - component gas , if one assumes that all particle species have the same excluded - volume parameter . in our calculations we put it to be the same for the pions and pion resonances .",
    "the standard procedure of derivation of the van der waals equation in the statistical physics shows that the excluded - volume parameter is equal to the absolute value of the repulsive part of the second virial coefficient @xcite .",
    "therefore , the excluded - volume parameter for the pions can be identified with the repulsive part of the ci @xmath65 ( see fig .",
    "[ fdiv ] ) : @xmath235 hence , to find the pressure of the interacting pion gas in the framework of the van der waals excluded volume model we solve the transcendental equation @xmath236 the particle density of the pions is found from @xmath237 } \\ ] ]    the result of the calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fmult ] .",
    "it is seen that essential deviation from the second order cluster expansion take place at the temperatures @xmath238 mev .",
    "a comparison with the ideal gas model of pions and pion resonances shows that the effects of the hard - core repulsion are not cancelled by the effects of the finite resonance width .",
    "this leads to an essential ( up to @xmath239% ) suppression of the pion density with respect to the ideal gas of pions and pion resonances .",
    "a quantum mechanical formula for the second cluster integral for the gas of relativistic particles with hard - core interaction was derived and analyzed . in the nonrelativistic classical limit , this formula is reduced to the expression used in refs.@xcite . in the quantum case , however , the value of the cluster integral appears to be much larger in magnitude than the corresponding classical value and , in contrast to the classical case , depends on the temperature even in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the second cluster integral for the pion gas all reasonable temperatures is far away from the classical limit .",
    "its repulsive part , which can be interpreted as proper particle volume , is an order of magnitude larger than it could be expected from the classical evaluation .",
    "it should be mentioned that not only quantum effects but also relativistic ones are important in the case of pion gas .",
    "surprisingly , they essentially modify the proper pion volume even at relatively low temperatures @xmath240 mev .",
    "the role of finite resonance width in the second cluster integral was studied .",
    "it was established that the widely used _",
    "formula @xcite with the normalized breit - wigner resonance profile is unsuitable for broad resonances lying close to the threshold , the parametrization of the experimental phase shifts should be used instead .",
    "the most striking example of this kind is the @xmath168-resonance .",
    "our analysis shows that in the case of @xmath168-resonance the calculations with the normalized breit - wigner profile can give even worse result than simple zero - width approximation .    at the second order of cluster expansion , due to the presence of broad resonances in the @xmath0-system , the negative contribution of the hard core repulsion into the cluster integral almost canceled by positive contributions of finite resonance widths in a rather broad temperature range . because of this fact",
    ", the thermodynamical properties of the interacting pion gas in the second cluster approximation appear to be quite similar to those of the ideal gas of pions and two - pion resonances : the error in the value of the particle density does not exceed a few percents . surprisingly , the account for finite resonance widths without account for the hard core repulsion as well as consideration of the hard core repulsion when the resonance widths are neglected worsen rather than improve a simple ideal gas model of pions and zero - width pion resonances .",
    "both effects should be either neglected or taken into account simultaneously .",
    "this does not mean , however , that we can restrict ourselves to the simple ideal gas picture of pions and zero - width pion resonances at all temperatures . as it has been demonstrated , when the temperature is sufficiently high ( @xmath238 mev ) , the pion density becomes so large that the cluster expansion can not be truncated at the second order .",
    "in contrast to the second cluster approximation , an appreciable deviation from the ideal gas model is observed , when the higher order terms are taken into account . in the framework of van der waals excluded - volume model",
    ", the pion density appears to be up to @xmath239% lower than that of the ideal pion - resonance gas .",
    "hence , at high particle densities the correct model of the pion gas must include all pion resonances and the resonance width as well as the repulsive interactions between the particles must be taken into account .",
    "it should be emphasized that , if the model takes properly into account the hard core repulsion , there is no reason to drop the @xmath168-resonance .",
    "it must be included into the model along with other resonances .",
    "the developed in the present paper approach will be used for calculation of excluded volumes of other hadrons .",
    "this will allow us to study the influence of hard core repulsion on the properties of realistic hadron gas including ( anti-)nucleons and strange particles by means of multicomponent van der waals equation @xcite .",
    "we expect essentially larger excluded volume effects for nucleons : preliminary calculations show that the proper volume of the nucleon is essentially ( by the factor @xmath241 ) larger than that of the pion .",
    "thus the hard core repulsion may essentially modify the particle number ratios in comparison to widely used ideal resonance gas model .",
