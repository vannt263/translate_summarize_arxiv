    "when considering hadron collider data for the determination of pdfs , one of the most effective and distinguishing sets is the cross section for production of high-@xmath0 jets . indeed , this is one of the few direct probes of the gluon distribution in pdf fits , with the gluon constraint from fitting dis and drell - yan data being overwhelmingly indirect via the quark and antiquark evolution . until recently , the only hadron collider data on the inclusive jet cross section which was available for pdf fits was that produced at the tevatron by the cdf @xcite and d @xcite collaborations .",
    "these were shown to have a significant constraining effect on the pdfs , and were particularly useful in decoupling the correlation between the gluon distribution and the strong coupling .",
    "the introduction of lhc data is expected to have an even larger impact on the current modern pdf sets @xcite due to the extension in the range of @xmath1 and @xmath2 probed .",
    "we will consider the quality of the fit to lhc inclusive jet data , both from atlas and cms , in section 2 of this article . as well as",
    "investigating how well the current mstw pdfs fit the data we will examine the impact of the data both by considering the pdf uncertainty eigenvectors and checking which improve the fit quality and which cause it to deteriorate , and also by using the pdf reweighting procedure .",
    "the latter provides a quantitative estimate of the genuine effect of a new data set on both the central value and uncertainty of a pdf set .",
    "so far the only type of hadron collider jet data included in the determination of the mstw 2008 pdf sets , or indeed any other available pdf set , is the inclusive jet production .",
    "there is some tevatron dijet data @xcite spanning the same range in energy and rapidity as the inclusive data , but this has not been used in used obtaining pdfs , though some studies of the fit quality and potential impact have been made @xcite .",
    "this is perhaps largely due to the fact that the dijet data sample has a significant overlap with the inclusive jet data sample .",
    "the inclusive data were chosen due to there being a less reliable theoretical understanding of the high rapidity dijet production as a function of dijet mass , @xmath3 .",
    "this issue will be studied in more detail in section 3 of this article , for both the older d dijet data and the more recent atlas and cms data . as for the inclusive data the fit quality using the existing mstw2008 pdfs , and the potential impact of the new data will be studied .    in the next section",
    "we will include the atlas and cms inclusive data in a new fit explicitly using the mstw2008 framework .",
    "this will provide the most detailed results on the impact of these new data sets , also including the effect on the strong coupling constant @xmath4 obtained from the fit .",
    "it also provides an opportunity to compare the results from including a new data set explicitly in the fit with the results obtained from pdf reweighting , the first time this has been studied for the reweighting procedure using the hessian approach .",
    "we find reasonable agreement between the results obtained using reweighting and from fitting explicitly , but the former seems to imply a slightly greater reduction in uncertainty than is found from direct inclusion of data .",
    "we also briefly investigate different forms of reweighting and the uncertainty estimation for pdfs .    throughout this article",
    "we will base our main results on an analysis using pdfs and jet cross sections at nlo in qcd , removing any ambiguity due to the lack of knowledge of the full nnlo jet cross sections .",
    "we will comment on nnlo corrections at the end of the article .",
    "there are also electroweak corrections ( see @xcite for a summary ) which could potentially be quite large .",
    "however , there is still some disagreement upon the nature of these corrections , and so they are omitted from the analysis .",
    "we also base our study on the framework of the mstw2008 pdf fit . although there have been updates @xcite including new data sets , pdf parameterisations , deuterium corrections and heavy flavour schemes , and even some publicly released pdfs @xcite , in order to isolate the singular effect of the inclusion of jet data without potential contamination from these other updates we present the impact of the jet data and nothing else on mstw2008 pdfs .",
    "a forth - coming pdf update will include all these various sources of improvement or update , and the specific impact of the jet data within this larger set of changes is known to be very similar to that presented in this article .",
    "in this section the details of the theoretical prediction for inclusive jet cross sections at the lhc are studied and the effects they have on the pdfs is analysed . the first lhc data to have a true ability to probe new regions of the @xmath5 plane for current pdfs was that from the atlas collaboration on the inclusive jet and dijet cross sections at 7  tev using @xmath6 of data @xcite . to demonstrate this ability , figure [ xreach2 ] shows the distribution of the parton momentum fractions @xmath7 and @xmath8 for nlojet++ @xcite events at the tevatron and the lhc . in these , and similar subsequent plots , the points have been generated at nlo using unweighted events , though the plots would look very similar at lo . in the highest rapidity bin , the atlas data is probing values of @xmath9 , 2 orders of magnitude lower than at d .",
    "these plots are dominated by the low @xmath0 bins within each rapidity bin , due to the orders of magnitude greater number of jets produced at low @xmath0 .",
    "the higher @xmath0 jets require higher @xmath1 values , and the spots in fig .",
    "[ xreach2 ] shift along the diagonal line parallel to @xmath10 towards higher @xmath1 as the @xmath0 of the jets is increased . comparing the plots at lhc and tevatron energies",
    "shows the value of the lhc data . for inclusive jets",
    ", the pdfs can be probed down to @xmath11 at high rapidities , a factor of 10 better than the tevatron reach .",
    "the sensitivity of the data to different partons is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ partons ] , where the cross section calculation is broken down into 4 partonic subprocesses : gluon - gluon , quark - gluon , quark - quark , antiquark - antiquark .    clearly , different areas of phase space provide more information about certain pdfs than others . in the lowest rapidity bin for instance ,",
    "the low @xmath0 jets are produced predominantly by initial state gluons , whereas the hardest jets are dominated by the quark - quark process . by combining this information with that obtained from figure [ xreach2 ]",
    ", we can see that the low-@xmath0 central jets will provide information on the low x gluon , whereas high-@xmath0 will shed light on the high x valence quark distributions .",
    "the fraction probed changes as a function of rapidity . as the rapidity of the inclusive jets increases ,",
    "the events are produced predominantly by a combination of one low @xmath1 and one high @xmath1 parton , which can again be seen in the plots of fig .",
    "[ xreach2 ] .",
    "this means that the quark - gluon process becomes dominant at high rapidities , especially at high @xmath0 , and so these bins in the data will simultaneously probe the gluon and the quark distributions .",
    "the @xmath12 used to compare data to theory is similar to that used for jet data in mstw pdf fits . each data point is allowed to move with respect to the theory prediction due to the many systematic uncertainties in the measurement . for each source of systematic uncertainty , a nuisance parameter @xmath13 is introduced , such that shifts will only occur if the reduction in @xmath12 is significant .",
    "the exact form of the expression used is :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 labels the individual data points and @xmath16 labels the correlated systematics . for the atlas 7  tev data ,",
    "the number of correlated systematics is 88 when including the hadronisation uncertainty .",
    "the uncorrelated error is the sum in quadrature of the statistical error and the 3 uncorrelated systematic errors .",
    "this definition is not identical to the standard mstw fit due to the treatment of normalisations , which here is considered a standard source of systematic error . in the actual fits ,",
    "the normalisations are treated separately , and this will be discussed later in the article .",
    "it is possible to solve this equation for @xmath13 analytically , giving the optimum systematic shifts directly . by minimising the @xmath12",
    "the result is :    @xmath17    where    @xmath18    hence , by calculating and subsequently inverting the @xmath19 matrix @xmath20 , and the vector @xmath21 , the optimal values of the nuisance parameters can be found .",
    "the correlated systematics for both the inclusive and dijet data sets are mostly antisymmetric , and so a method of symmetrising to obtain a single error for each data point must be employed .",
    "since this is a matter of choice and should not affect the results in any meaningful way , three opposing methods were used to test the effect .",
    "these were :    @xmath22    @xmath23 denotes the two opposing values of the antisymmetric errors , and the convention is that the sign denotes the sign of the error for the first point , i.e. lowest rapidity and @xmath0 ( or @xmath24 for dijets ) .",
    "the sign of the error is not necessarily maintained throughout the whole data set .",
    "the difference in @xmath12 obtained from these methods varied by no more than @xmath25 across all theory predictions .",
    "in all the following results , the third definition is used to calculate the @xmath12 values .",
    "[ inclusiveratio ] shows the ratio of data to theory ( calculated with fastnlo @xcite version 2 @xcite which uses nlojet++",
    "@xcite ) using mstw2008 nlo pdfs for the atlas 7  tev r=0.4 inclusive jet cross section , both before and after the correlated systematics are taken into account .",
    "the former gives a very poor agreement , with all data points above theory by up to 40% .",
    "the systematics are , however , large and the shifted points , defined as @xmath26 are almost all within 1@xmath27 of 1 .",
    "the r=0.4 data set is chosen as default over the r=0.6 due to the much smaller hadronisation corrections in the case of the smaller jet parameter .",
    "tables [ table : nolin ] and [ table : nolin2 ] demonstrate that a @xmath12 of less than 1 per point is achieved for a variety of scale choices and both r parameter choices , whilst the vast majority of the @xmath13 penalty terms are less than 0.5 .",
    "this implies that the fit is a very good one , however the large shifts observed in the data alongside the small penalty terms implies that the systematic uncertainties are very large , and may be drowning out any underlying physics effects .",
    ".@xmath12 per point ( 90 points ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to give some indication of how nnlo pdfs perform for lhc jet cross sections the nnlo pdf predictions for the atlas jet cross sections are calculated using just the nlo qcd cross section .",
    "the fit value with nnlo pdfs and nnlo coupling is shown in table [ table : chi_ratio_nnlo ] .",
    "the nnlo mstw set describes the data after the low @xmath0 cuts are applied well .",
    "again the additive error treatment with the additional cuts is shown in the third column.we also repeat this exercise for the cms inclusive jet data , and the results are in table [ table : chi_cms2 ] . again",
    "the fit quality is very good .",
    "we have also tried , as a rough experiment , to compare the prediction using nnlo pdfs and a very approximate nnlo k - factor based on the results in @xcite .",
    "this causes the fit quality to deteriorate quite significantly if not dramatically .",
    "a refit of the pdfs results in a fit quality similar to that obtained in nlo fits ( though slightly worse ) , little change in nnlo pdfs ( though with a trend similar to the changes the lhc jet data induce in nlo pdfs ) and a reduction in the nnlo @xmath4 value extracted of order 0.001 .",
    "however , since the gluon - gluon initiated contribution is not dominant , particularly at high @xmath0 , it is difficult to draw strong conclusions beyond the fact that the still large systematic uncertainties on jet data at the lhc will likely allow fairly good quality fits for something similar to the current pdf and @xmath28 values unless the full nnlo corrections are somewhat larger than seems likely .",
    "the data which has been measured during the first run of the lhc at 7  tev is our first look at qcd in a new energy regime , and so the jet data is an important test of our current knowledge of pdfs .",
    "the conclusion from these first data sets is that the mstw2008 pdfs hold up well in this regime , since none of the inclusive jet data from either atlas or cms has required a pdf to move outside its 1@xmath27 error band .",
    "the earliest released measurement was the least discerning for pdfs ; the atlas inclusive jet cross section at 7  tev using 36 @xmath29 of luminosity was inevitably dominated by systematics uncertainties .",
    "the fit quality obtained using mstw2008 pdfs is very good and any variation in physics parameters used is incapable of improving the fit in any significant way .",
    "the lack of constraint due to large systematic uncertainties is significantly improved by the inclusion of a simultaneous measurement at center of mass energy 2.76  tev .",
    "the cancellation of systematic effects associated with jet energy scale provides a more suitable environment for testing pdfs . in this measurement , too , a good fit is found for mstw2008 pdfs .",
    "the potential impact of the data was investigated using the pdf reweighting procedure .",
    "although the data prefers a larger low-@xmath1 and softer high-@xmath1 gluon , these movements are still entirely within the error bands .",
    "a significant improvement in error is seen for the gluon across all @xmath1 , which implies that , if included in a new fit , this data could provide more accurate pdfs for the lhc era .",
    "the published cms inclusive data at 7  tev is also analysed . with much higher luminosity than the atlas data ,",
    "this is currently the published measurement with the most potential for pdf effects . again a reasonable fit is found for mstw2008 , although the @xmath12 per point is higher than the atlas fit . due to the kinematics of the measurement , more focus is given to the quark densities for this set , and some reduction in the error bands is seen for all flavours . again , including this data into a new fit would appear to provide pdfs with some improved constraints .",
    "a detailed study into hadron - hadron dijet cross sections in relation to pdfs has been also been presented .",
    "the instability of the calculation observed at the tevatron using the scale choice of @xmath30 is explained by the behaviour of the kinematics at high rapidities .",
    "calculations using other scale choices involving the dijet mass do not exhibit these problems , and so potentially provide a more reliable estimate of the scale uncertainty . for atlas dijets ,",
    "the instability is even more clear for the @xmath30 calculation , with a very poor fit for low values of the scale multiplier quickly becoming an excellent fit for higher , unrealistic values .",
    "a study of the behaviour of the individual data points under scale variations demonstrates a saddle point structure which is centred around the central scale choice for low rapidity bins , and which can become a constantly decreasing plane at higher rapidities .",
    "the best scale choice to maintain the stability of each bin under scale variations is something similar to @xmath31 , as suggested many years ago @xcite .",
    "the best fit to data is clearly obtained for scale choices similar to @xmath32 for tevatron data , whereas choices with less rapidity dependence are preferred by the atlas data .",
    "the difference is perhaps related to the fact that one is a proton - antiproton collider and the other a proton - proton collider , so different pdf combinations are probed even after one takes account of the different collider energies .",
    "the reweighting procedure has been conducted for d , atlas and cms dijet data , and in general the resulting preferred pdf depends upon the scale choice used .",
    "this is not an ideal situation , since the physics can not depend on an unphysical mathematical property of the calculation .",
    "however , for the cms dijet cross section , which does not extend to very large rapidity , an agreement is reached between the scale choices , which is for a slightly smaller gluon across much of the @xmath1 range , except very high @xmath1 , with the largest change at moderate @xmath33 values .",
    "this also agrees with one of the scale choices for atlas dijets .",
    "this result is notable due to it being the opposite effect required to describe the atlas and cms inclusive jet data , implying a possible conflict between the two datasets , or different forms of higher order qcd corrections ( the shape of the nnlo inclusive and dijet corrections so far available @xcite does not appear to be identical ) .    for the first time , lhc jet data has also been included directly in the framework of the mstw pdf fit .",
    "the data sets included represent the highest precision inclusive jet cross sections from both atlas and cms to date .",
    "two fits were initially performed with the new data , including the cms inclusive jet data and atlas 7  tev inclusive jet data : one allowing all standard mstw parameters to be free , and one with @xmath34 fixed to the mstw2008 value .",
    "the entirely free set showed a significant reduction in global @xmath12 , although much of this was due to a shift in @xmath34 which significantly improved some fixed target data . with @xmath34",
    "fixed the fit again improved , although to a lesser extent , with the majority of improvement coming from the fit to the new data sets .",
    "the improvement was dominated by the cms data due to the previously noted issue of the large atlas systematic errors . with the new central values and eigenvectors ,",
    "the reweighting procedure was applied to study the change in the effect after the addition of the atlas 2.76  tev data set .",
    "this was shown to still have an effect on the gluon , with a similar but less pronounced shape than was seen when reweighting the mstw2008 set with the same data .",
    "dijet data was shown again to have a different effect on the pdfs to the corresponding inclusive data , which is further evidence for their value in a future global fit .",
    "the atlas combined data , having shown an effect through reweighting , was then included in a second fit along with the cms data .",
    "this further improved the global fit , with the fit to cms showing a similar improvement to the first set , and an additional improvement from the atlas data itself .",
    "this demonstrated an excellent agreement between the atlas and cms data sets , which had already been observed through the reweighting technique .",

    "<S> we consider the effect on lhc jet cross sections on partons distribution functions ( pdfs ) , in particular the mstw2008 set of pdfs . we first compare the published inclusive jet data to the predictions using mstw2008 , finding a very good description . </S>",
    "<S> we also use the parton distribution reweighting procedure to estimate the impact of these new data on the pdfs , finding that the combined atlas 2.76  tev and 7  tev data , and cms 7  tev data have some significant impact . </S>",
    "<S> we then also investigate the impact of atlas , cms and d dijet data using the same techniques . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effect of using different scale choices for the nlo cross section calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dijet data is generally not completely compatible with the corresponding inclusive jet data , often tending to pull pdfs , particularly the gluon distribution , away from the default values . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effect depends on the dijet data set used as well as the scale choice . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that conclusions may be affected by limiting the pull on the data luminosity chosen by the best fit , which is sometimes a number of standard deviations . </S>",
    "<S> finally we include the inclusive jet data in a new pdf fit explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to check the consistency of the exact result with that obtained from the reweighting procedure . </S>",
    "<S> there is generally good , but not full quantitative agreement . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the conclusion remains that mstw2008 pdfs already fit the published jet data well , but the central values and uncertainties are altered and improved respectively by significant , but not dramatic extent by inclusion of these data .    </S>",
