    "in this paper we investigate the origin and the consequences of the _ bi - stability jump _ of the stellar winds of early - type stars near spectral type b1 .",
    "this bi - stability jump is observed as a steep decrease in the terminal velocity of the winds from @xmath8 for supergiants of types earlier than b1 to @xmath9 for supergiants of types later than b1 ( lamers et al .",
    "we will show that this jump in the wind velocity is accompanied by a jump in the mass - loss rate with @xmath7 increasing by about a factor of five for supergiants with  between 27  500 and 22  500 k.    the theory of radiation driven winds predicts that the mass - loss rates and terminal velocities of the winds of early - type stars depend smoothly on the stellar parameters , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( castor et al .",

    "this theory has not yet been applied to predict the observed jump in the ratio @xmath0 for supergiants near spectral type b1 .",
    "the change from a fast to a slow wind is called the @xmath12-@xmath13 jump .",
    "if the wind momentum @xmath14 were about constant across the bi - stability jump , it would imply that the mass - loss rate would _ increase _ steeply by about a factor of two from stars with spectral types earlier than b1 to later than b1 . unfortunately , there are no reliable mass - loss determinations from observations for stars later than spectral type b1 .",
    "so far , a physical explanation of the nature of this bi - stability jump has been lacking . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to provide such an explanation and we investigate the change in mass - loss rate that is accompanied by the change in @xmath15 .",
    "the concept of a bi - stability jump was first described by pauldrach & puls ( 1990 ) in connection to their model calculations of the wind of the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) star p  cygni (= 19.3 kk ) .",
    "their models showed that small perturbations in the basic parameters of this star can either result in a wind with a relatively high mass loss , but low terminal velocity , _ or _ in a wind with relatively low , but high .",
    "their suggestion was that the mechanism is related to the behaviour of the lyman continuum .",
    "if the lyman continuum exceeds a certain optical depth , then as a consequence , the ionization of the metals shifts to a lower stage .",
    "this causes a larger line acceleration @xmath16 and finally yields a jump in @xmath7 .",
    "the models of pauldrach & puls ( 1990 ) for p cygni show that the wind momentum loss per second , @xmath14 , is about constant on both sides of the jump ( see lamers & pauldrach 1991 ) .",
    "so lamers et al .",
    "( 1995 ) put forward the idea that the mass - loss rate for normal stars could increase by about a factor of two , if @xmath15 decreases by a factor of two , so that @xmath14 is constant on both sides of the jump .    whether this is indeed the case , is still unknown . to investigate the behaviour of the mass loss at the bi - stability jump",
    ", we will derive mass - loss rates for a grid of wind models over a range in .",
    "the main goal of the paper is to understand the processes that cause the bi - stability jump .",
    "although our results are based on complex numerical simulations , we have attempted to provide a simple picture of the relevant physics .",
    "we focus on the observed bi - stability jump for normal supergiants .",
    "nevertheless , these results may also provide valuable insight into the possible bi - stable winds of lbvs .",
    "it is worth mentioning that lamers & pauldrach ( 1991 ) and lamers et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested that the bi - stability mechanism may be responsible for the outflowing disks around rapidly - rotating b[e ] stars .",
    "therefore our results may also provide information about the formation of rotation induced bi - stable disks .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in sect .",
    "[ sec : simple ] we describe the basic stellar wind theory .",
    "in particular we concentrate on the question : `` what determines  and ? '' .",
    "we show that  is determined by the radiative acceleration in the _ subsonic _ region . in sect .",
    "[ sec : method ] we explain the method that we use to calculate the radiative acceleration with a monte carlo technique and the mass - loss rates of a grid of stellar parameters . sect .",
    "[ sec : isa ] describes the properties of the models for which we predict . in sect .",
    "[ sec : predictions ] our predicted bi - stability jump in mass loss will be presented .",
    "then , in sect .  [ sec : origin ] we discuss the origin of this jump and show that it is due to a shift in the ionization balance of fe iv to fe iii .",
    "then , we discuss the possible role of the bi - stability jump in  on the variability of lbv stars in sect .",
    "[ sec : lbv ] . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , the study will be summarized and discussed .",
    "mass loss from early - type stars is due to radiation pressure in lines and in the continuum ( mainly by electron scattering ) .",
    "since the radiative acceleration by line processes is the dominant contributor , the winds are `` line - driven '' , i.e. the momentum of the radiation is transferred to the ions by line scattering or line absorption .",
    "line - scattering and line absorption occur at all distances in the wind , from the photosphere up to distances of tens of stellar radii .",
    "so the radiative acceleration of the wind covers a large range in distance .",
    "the equation of motion of a stationary stellar wind is    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the radiative acceleration .",
    "together with the mass continuity equation    @xmath19    and the expression for the gas pressure @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the gas constant and @xmath22 is the mean mass per free particle in units of @xmath23 , we find the equation of motion    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the isothermal speed of sound .",
    "for simplicity we have assumed that the atmosphere is isothermal . in this expression",
    "the effective mass @xmath26 is corrected for the radiation pressure by electron scattering .",
    "@xmath16 is the line acceleration .",
    "the equation has a singularity at the point where @xmath27 , this critical point is the sonic point .",
    "if the line acceleration @xmath28 is known as a function of @xmath29 , the equation can be solved numerically .",
    "a smoothly accelerating wind solution requires that the numerator of eq .",
    "[ eq : vdvdr1 ] reaches zero exactly at the sonic point where the denominator vanishes .",
    "it should be stated that _ this _ critical point ( sonic point ) at @xmath30 and @xmath31 20 km s@xmath32 is _ not _ the same as the cak critical point .",
    "the cak critical point is located much further out in the wind at @xmath33 and about @xmath34 . if the line acceleration @xmath16 in eq .",
    "[ eq : vdvdr1 ] were to be rewritten as a function of velocity gradient instead of radius , then one would find the cak critical point .",
    "pauldrach et al .",
    "( 1986 ) showed that if the finite disk correction to the cak theory is applied , then the modified cak critical point moves inward and is located at @xmath35 and at @xmath36 km s@xmath32 .",
    "this is much closer to the sonic point !",
    "although the ( modified ) cak critical solution may well provide the correct mass - loss rate and terminal velocity , there is concern about its physical reality ( see e.g. lucy 1998 and lamers & cassinelli 1999 for a thorough discussion ) .",
    "lucy ( 1998 ) has given arguments favouring the sonic point as the physical more meaningful critical point .",
    "we will use the sonic point as the physically relevant critical point .",
    "this is the point where the mass - loss rate is fixed . throughout the paper we will therefore refer to the _ subsonic _ part of the wind for the region close to the photosphere where the mass loss is determined , and to the _ supersonic _",
    "part for the region beyond the sonic point where the mass - loss rate is already fixed , but the velocity has still to be determined",
    ".    the critical solution can be found by numerically integrating eq .",
    "[ eq : vdvdr1 ] , starting from some lower boundary @xmath37 in the photosphere , with pre - specified values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 and with a trial value of @xmath40 . the value of @xmath40 that produces a velocity law that passes smoothly through the critical point is the correct value .",
    "alternatively , for a non - isothermal wind with a pre - specified @xmath41-relation , one can integrate inwards from the critical point with an assumed location @xmath42 , and then adjust this value until the inward solution gives a density structure that reaches @xmath43 at the location where @xmath44 ( e.g. see pauldrach et al .",
    "the critical solution specifies the values of @xmath45 , @xmath39 ( given by @xmath46 ) and @xmath40 at the lower boundary .",
    "this fixes the value of  via the mass continuity equation ( eq . [ eq : continuity ] ) .",
    "note that  is determined by the conditions in the _ subsonic _ region",
    "!    we will show below that an _ increase _ in @xmath28 in the subsonic region results in an _ increase _ in .",
    "this can be understood because in the _ subsonic _ region , where the denominator of eq .",
    "[ eq : vdvdr1 ] is negative , an increase in @xmath16 gives a smaller velocity gradient .",
    "integrating from the sonic point inwards to the lower boundary with a smaller velocity gradient , implies that the velocity the lower boundary should be higher and hence the mass - loss rate , @xmath47 , must be higher . on the other hand ,",
    "an increase in @xmath16 in the _ supersonic _ region , yields a larger velocity gradient and this would directly increase the terminal velocity .",
    "another way to understand how an increase in  is caused by an increase in @xmath16 below the sonic point , is based on the realization that the density structure of the subsonic region is approximately that of a static atmosphere .",
    "this can be seen in eq .",
    "[ eq : motion ] .",
    "since the term @xmath48 is much smaller than the acceleration of gravity , it can approximately be set to zero in the subsonic region .",
    "( this is not correct close to the sonic point . ) in an isothermal static atmosphere the density structure follows the pressure scaleheight . adding an extra outward force in the subsonic region results in an increase of the pressure - scaleheight and hence in a slower outward decrease in density .",
    "this means that just below the sonic point , where @xmath49 , the density @xmath50 will be higher than without the extra force . applying the mass continuity equation ( eq .  [ eq : continuity ] ) at the sonic point",
    "then shows that the mass - loss rate will be higher than without the extra force in the subsonic region .",
    "( see lamers & cassinelli 1999 for a thorough discussion ) .",
    "a simple numerical experiment serves to demonstrate the dependence of  on the radiative acceleration in the subsonic region .",
    "we start with an isothermal model of the wind from a star of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath1 = 25  000 k , @xmath53@xmath54 k. we then specify the line acceleration @xmath28 in such a way that it produces a stellar wind with a mass - loss rate of @xmath55 and with a @xmath56-type wind velocity law    @xmath57    where @xmath56 = 1 and @xmath58 km s@xmath32 .",
    "( this @xmath28 is found by solving eq .",

    "we choose the point where @xmath59 g @xmath60 at @xmath61 .",
    "figure [ f_testbumps ] shows the resulting variation of @xmath28 . adopting this variation of @xmath28 and solving the momentum equation with the condition that the solution goes smoothly through the sonic point , we retrieve the input mass - loss rate and input velocity law , as one would expect .",
    "the sonic point is located at @xmath62 where @xmath63 km s@xmath32 , and where @xmath64 cm s@xmath65 .",
    "let us study what happens to  and  if we change the line acceleration in the subsonic region . to this purpose",
    "we add a gaussian `` bump '' to @xmath28 .",
    "this bump is characterized by    @xmath66    where @xmath67 , @xmath68 describes the location of the peak at @xmath69 and @xmath70 gives the width of the bump ( @xmath71 ) . the line acceleration with the extra bumps",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ f_testbumps ] .",
    "the solution of the momentum equation , with the condition that it passes smoothly through the sonic point , gives the velocity at the lower boundary and hence the mass - loss rate .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] shows the resulting mass - loss rates as a function of the peak value of the bump in the line acceleration in the subsonic region .",
    "we see that as the line acceleration in the subsonic region increases ,  increases .",
    "once  is fixed by the processes in the subsonic region , the radiative acceleration in the supersonic region then determines the terminal velocity  that the wind will reach .",
    "this can easily be seen in the following way . integrating the momentum equation",
    "( eq . [ eq : motion ] ) in the supersonic region from the critical point @xmath42 to infinity , and ignoring the influence of the gas pressure , gives    @xmath72    so    @xmath73    here we have used the observed property that @xmath74 and that @xmath75 , so @xmath76 .",
    "[ eq : vinfty ] says that  is determined by the integral of @xmath28 in the _ supersonic _ region .    the radiative acceleration in the _ supersonic _ part of",
    "the wind will _ decrease _ as  is forced to increase by an _ increase _ in the radiative acceleration in the _ subsonic _ part of the wind .",
    "this is because the optical depth of the optically thick driving lines , which is proportional to the density in the wind , will increase .",
    "thus an increase in  results in an increase of the line optical depth .",
    "this results in a decrease of @xmath16 in the supersonic region , which gives a lower terminal velocity .",
    "we will estimate this effect below .",
    "assume that the radiative acceleration by lines depends on the optical depth in the wind , as given by cak theory ( castor et al .",

    "it is given by @xmath81 .",
    "the optical depth parameter is    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the mean thermal velocity of the protons .",
    "let us define @xmath84 as the radiative acceleration in the _ supersonic _ part of the initial wind model , i.e. without the increased mass - loss rate due to the bump in the subsonic region , and @xmath28 as the radiative acceleration of the model with the increased . from eqs .",

    "let us now compare the terminal velocities of the initial model without the bump , to that with the increased mass - loss rate due to the bump , in a simple but crude way , by solving the momentum equation in the supersonic part of the wind . if we neglect the terms due to the gas pressure and due to the gravity , the momentum equation in the supersonic part of the wind reduces to    @xmath86    solving the equation for the initial model and the model with the increased   results in the following expression    @xmath87    so the ratio between the terminal velocities of the models with and without the increased mass - loss rate is    @xmath88    where we adopted @xmath89 ( pauldrach et al .",
    "1986 ) for the last expression .",
    "we see that  will decrease roughly as @xmath90 when the mass - loss rate increases .",
    "the result is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] .    we realize that this numerical test is a drastic simplification of the real situation : ( a ) we have assumed an isothermal wind ; ( b ) we have taken the lower boundary at a fixed density ; ( c ) we have ignored possible changes in the ionization of the wind due to changes in  and ( d ) we have ignored the role of the gas pressure and of gravity in estimating the change in .",
    "however , this simple test serves the purpose of explaining _ qualitatively _ that the mass - loss rate depends on the radiative acceleration in the subsonic part of the wind only , and that an increase in the mass - loss rate due to an increase of @xmath16 in the subsonic region will also be accompanied by a decrease in . in the rest of the paper , we will _ quantitatively _ calculate radiative accelerations and mass - loss rates with a method which will be described in sect .",
    "[ sec : method ] .",
    "thus , an _ increase _ in the radiative acceleration in the _ subsonic _ region of the wind results in an _ increase _ of  and a _ decrease _ in .",
    "so , in order to understand the origin of the bi - stability jump of radiation driven winds , and to predict its effect on  and , we should pay close attention to the calculated radiative acceleration in the _ subsonic _ part of the wind .",
    "in order to understand the nature of the bi - stability jump , we calculate a series of radiation driven wind models for supergiants in the range of = 12  500 to 40  000 k. the calculation of the radiative acceleration of the winds requires the computation of the contributions of a very large number of spectral lines . to this end",
    ", we first calculate the thermal , density and ionization structure of a wind model computed with the non - lte expanding atmosphere code isa - wind ( de koter et al .",
    "1993)(for details , see sect .",
    "[ sec : isa ] ) .",
    "we then calculate the radiative acceleration by following the fate of a very large number of photons that are released from below the photosphere into the wind , by means of a monte carlo technique . in this section ,",
    "we describe the basic physical properties of the adopted monte carlo ( mc ) technique which was first applied to the study of winds of early - type stars by abbott & lucy ( 1985 ) .",
    "then , we describe the calculation of the radiative acceleration by lines with the mc method , and finally the method for calculating theoretical mass - loss rates .",
    "the lines in the mc method are described in the sobolev approximation .",
    "this approximation for the line acceleration is valid if the physical conditions over a sobolev length do not change significantly , i.e.    @xmath91    where _ f _  is any physically relevant variable for the line driving , e.g. density , temperature or ionization fraction .",
    "@xmath92 is a combination of thermal and turbulent velocities .",
    "[ eq : sob ] shows that the validity range of the sobolev approximation is in practice somewhat arbitrary , since it depends on the value of the turbulent velocity which is poorly known .",
    "nevertheless , the sobolev approximation is often used ( e.g. abbott & lucy 1985 ) and we will also adopt it in calculating the line acceleration and mass loss , mainly because of computational limitations .",
    "we can not exclude that due to the use of the sobolev approximation we may predict quantitatively inaccurate line accelerations below the sonic point .",
    "however , _ if _ an exact treatment would be followed , then this is expected to have a systematic effect on the line acceleration for _ all _ models .",
    "therefore , we do not expect our conclusions regarding the origin of the bi - stability jump to be affected .",
    "the sobolev approximation implies that for scatterings in the frame co - moving with the ions in the wind ( co - moving frame , cmf ) , the incident and emerging frequencies are both equal to the rest frequency of the line transition @xmath93 in the cmf .    @xmath94    where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the incident and emerging frequencies in the cmf .",
    "in terms of quantities seen by an outside observer , these two cmf frequencies are given by :    @xmath97    and    @xmath98    where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the incident and emergent frequencies for an outside observer ; @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the direction cosines with respect to the radial flow velocity of the photons at the scattering point and @xmath103 is the radial flow velocity of the scattering ion for an outside observer .",
    "thermal motions of the scattering ions are assumed to be negligible compared to the motion of the outward flow .",
    "note that we adopted the same velocity @xmath103 for the ion before and after the photon interaction ( eqs .",
    "[ e_nuin ] and [ e_nuout ] ) .",
    "this is justified since the change in velocity due to the transfer of momentum from a photon to an ion is very small , i.e. about @xmath104 cm s@xmath32 per scattering .. therefore , the change in @xmath99 and @xmath100 is mainly determined by a change in direction angle .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "[ e_nuin ] and [ e_nuout ] gives the conservation of co - moving frequency in a scattering event ( abbott & lucy 1985 ) .",
    "@xmath105    because the energy and momentum of a photon are @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the equation can be rewritten in the following way :    @xmath108    eq .",
    "[ e_pe ] links the change in radial @xmath109 of a photon in an interaction with an ion with velocity @xmath103 to the @xmath110 loss of the photon . in order to determine the line acceleration @xmath16",
    "we will need to derive the momentum transfer from the photons to the _ ions _ in the wind .    for an outside observer ,",
    "the conservation of radial momentum is :    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is the mass of the moving ion and @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the radial velocities of the ion just before and after the scattering . for an outside observer :    @xmath115    and    @xmath116    again , the change in frequency is dominated by the change in direction angle .",
    "so the change in radial velocity per scattering , @xmath117 , is small compared to @xmath103 and is given by    @xmath118    since @xmath119 , eq .",

    "the increase in the radial momentum @xmath122 of the scattering ion is now given by :    @xmath123    where @xmath124 is the loss of _ radiative _ energy .",

    "1997 ) . in the calculation of the path of the photons we have properly taken into account the possibility that the photons can be scattered or absorbed & re - emitted due to true absorption or eliminated because they are scattered back into the star .",
    "the radiative transfer in mc - wind is calculated in the sobolev approximation .",

    "the line processes included are photon scattering and photon destruction by collisional de - excitation . in deciding",
    "whether a continuum or a line event takes place , we have improved the code in the following way : the key point of the monte - carlo `` game '' is that _ line _ processes can only occur at specific points in each shell of the stellar wind , whereas _ continuum _ processes can occur at any point .",
    "the correct way of treating the line and continuum processes is by comparing a random optical depth value to the _ combined _ optical depth for line and continuum processes along the photon s path .",
    "first , this combined optical depth is compared to a random number to decide whether a continuum or a line process takes place .",
    "this first part of the treatment is basically the same as described by mazzali & lucy ( 1993 ) for the case of line and electron scatterings only .",
    "now , after it has been decided that the process will be a continuum process , a second random number is drawn to decide _ which _ continuum process will take place , an electron scattering or absorption .",

    "next , the mass loss and terminal velocity were simultaneously calculated from these @xmath216 and @xmath217 parameters using the cak solution of the momentum equation .",
    "note that the solution with the finite disk correction ( pauldrach et al .",
    "1986 ) was _ not _ applied , since this is already properly taken into account in the values of @xmath216 and @xmath217 calculated in the monte carlo technique ( see sect .",

    "the superscript , mc , to the force multiplier parameters was added to avoid confusion with @xmath78 and @xmath79 for a point - like source used by e.g. kudritzki et al .",
    "the ratio @xmath0 can be derived from the simple cak formulation : + @xmath227 + the value for @xmath216 for the model of 30,000 k is significantly higher than values for @xmath79 that were calculated before ( e.g. pauldrach et al .",

    "we have found a jump in terminal velocity @xmath0 of a factor of two , similar as observed by lamers et al .",
    ". moreover , the mass - loss rates calculated from the cak formulation are consistent with those obtained from our monte carlo approach .",
    "_ this implies that the origin of the observed change in the ratio @xmath0 of a factor of two around spectral type b1 is identical to the predicted jump in mass - loss rate of a factor of five due to the recombination of fe  iv to fe  iii . _      from the results and figures presented above we conclude that the mass - loss rate of early - b supergiants near the bi - stability jump is mainly determined by the radiative acceleration by iron .",
    "although fe  iv is the dominant ionization stage in the atmosphere of stars near 25  000 k , it is fe  iii that gives the largest contribution to the subsonic line acceleration .",
    "this is due to the number of effective scattering lines and their distribution in wavelengths , compared to the energy distribution from the photosphere .",
    "this implies that the mass - loss rates of b - supergiants are very sensitive to the ionization equilibrium of fe in the upper photosphere .",
    "our models show that the ionization fraction of fe  iii increases drastically between = 27  500 and 25  000 k. this causes an increase in the line acceleration below the sonic point and in turn increases the mass loss near the bi - stability jump .",
    "luminous blue variables ( conti 1984 ) are massive stars undergoing a brief , but important stage of evolution . during this period",
    "they suffer severe mass loss with  values of up to @xmath229 .",
    "lbvs are characterized by typical variations in the order of @xmath230 of 1 to 2 magnitudes .",
    "nevertheless , the total bolometric luminosity of the star @xmath202 seems to be about constant .",
    "the reason for the typical lbv variations is still unknown . for reviews",
    "see nota & lamers ( 1997 ) .",
    "leitherer et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and de koter et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have shown that it must be the actual radius of the star that increases during these typical variations .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 decreases during the variations , if @xmath202 is about constant . in this paper , we have calculated the mass - loss behaviour for normal ob supergiants as a function of . despite many differences between ob supergiants and lbvs",
    ", we can retrieve valuable information about the behaviour of  during a typical lbv variation by investigating the  behaviour of normal ob supergiants , since both types of stars are located in the same part of the hrd .",
    "our calculations can be used as a tool to understand the mass loss changes of an lbv in terms of changes in  during such a typical variation ( see also leitherer et al .",
    "1989 ) .    observations of lbvs show that for some lbvs that undergo typical variations  is increasing from visual minimum to maximum , while for others it is the other way around :   is decreasing .",
    "this `` unpredictable '' behaviour of  during an lbv variation is not a complete surprise , if one considers our  values as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "we have found that in the ranges @xmath231 and @xmath232 ,  decreases for a decreasing , whereas in the interval between @xmath233 ,  increases for a decreasing .",
    "this shows that whether one expects an increasing or decreasing  during an lbv variation depends on the specific range in  between visual minimum and maximum .",
    "this was already suggested by lamers ( 1997 ) , albeit a constant value of @xmath175 was anticipated .",
    "our present calculations can not be used to model the observed lbv variations , because we have assumed solar metallicities , whereas the lbvs are known to have an enhanced he and n abundance ( e.g. smith et al . 1994 ) . moreover , since most lbvs have already suffered severe mass loss in the past , their @xmath234 ratio will be higher than for normal ob supergiants .",
    "this means that lbvs are closer to their eddington limit , which one may expect to have an effect on  also .",
    "these combined effects explain the lack of a consistent behaviour of  for lbv variations so far . especially since it is not sure that @xmath202 really remains constant during the variations ( see lamers 1995 ) .",
    "we have investigated the nature of the observed jump in the ratio @xmath0 of the winds of supergiants near spectral type b1 .",
    "calculations for wind models of ob supergiants show that around @xmath4 the mass - loss rate  jumps due to an increase in the line acceleration of fe  iii below the sonic point .",
    "this jump in  is found in three different series of models . in all cases ,",
    "the wind efficiency number @xmath235 increases significantly , by about a factor of 2  to 3 , if  decreases from about 27  500 k to about 22  500 k. observations show that the ratio @xmath0 drops by a factor of two around spectral type b1 . applying these values for @xmath0 , we predict a bi - stability jump in  of about a factor of five . so  is expected to increase by about this factor between 27  500 and 22  500 k.    we have argued that the mass loss is determined by the radiative acceleration in the subsonic part of the wind , i.e. below @xmath236 .",
    "we found that this radiative acceleration is dominated by the contribution of the fe  iii lines .",
    "therefore  is very sensitive to both the metal abundance and to the ionization equilibrium of fe .",
    "our models show that the ionization fraction of fe  iii and the subsonic radiative acceleration increases steeply between = 27  500 and 25  000 k. this explains the calculated increase in  in this narrow temperature range .",
    "the exact temperature of the bi - stability jump is somewhat ambiguous .",
    "observations indicate that the jump occurs around spectral type b1 , corresponding to @xmath1  @xmath237  21  000  k ( lamers et al .",
    "1995 ) . if one would not completely trust the value of @xmath0 for the star hd 109867 ( number 91 in lamers et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ) , because of its relatively large error bar , then @xmath1 of the observed jump can easily occur at a few kk higher .",
    "in fact we can not expect the bi - stability jump to occur at one and the same temperature for all luminosity classes , because the jump is sensitive to the ionization balance ( mainly of fe  iii ) in the subsonic region of the wind and hence to the gravity of the star .",
    "our models predict that the jump will occur near @xmath1 @xmath237  25  000  k. however , this is sensitive to the assumptions of the models : the adopted masses and luminosities and to the assumption of the modified nebular approximation for the calculation of the ionization equilibrium of iron ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : isa ] ) .",
    "a more consistent treatment of the ionization and excitation equilibrium of the fe - group elements may have two effects : _",
    "i ) _  predicted from @xmath153 may alter , and _",
    "ii ) _ @xmath1 at which the ionization ratio of e.g. fe  iii / iv flips , may shift . nevertheless , in view of the very encouraging results using the modified nebular approximation in the modeling of uv metal - line forests ( de koter et al .",
    "1998 ) , we expect the error in   at which the dominant ionization of fe switches from iv to iii to be at most a few kk .",
    "furthermore , if a more consistent treatment would yield a change in this would most likely produce a systematic shift .",
    "since we are essentially interested in relative shifts in @xmath7 , we do not expect that our conclusions regarding the nature of the bi - stability jump would be affected .",
    "it is relevant to mention that leitherer et al .",
    "( 1989 ) calculated atmospheric models for lbvs and suggested that the recombination of iron group elements from doubly to singly ionized stages , which according to them , occurs around  = 10  000 k , can explain  increases when lbvs approach their maximum states .",
    "we have found a fe  iii / iv ionization / recombination effect around  = 25  000 k for normal supergiants .",
    "we also anticipate that somewhere , at a lower value of a similar ionization / recombination effect will occur for fe  ii / iii , causing a _",
    "second _ bi - stability jump .",
    "lamers et al .",
    "( 1995 ) already mentioned the possible existence of a second bi - stability jump around  = 10  000 k from their determinations of , but the observational evidence for this second jump was meagre .",
    "possibly , this second jump _ is _ real and we anticipate that this second jump could very well originate from a fe  ii / iii ionization / recombination effect .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the elements c , n and o are important line drivers in the _ supersonic _ part of the wind , whereas the _ subsonic _ part of the wind is dominated by the line acceleration due to fe .",
    "therefore , we do _ not _ expect cno - processing to have a large impact on , but it might have impact on the terminal velocities .    finally , we would like to add that our calculations for  around @xmath4 have only been performed for _ one _ value of @xmath238 , @xmath202 and h / he abundance .",
    "is expected to depend on these stellar parameters , so calculating mass - loss rates for a wider range of stellar parameters will provide valuable information on the size of the bi - stability jump in  and  and will allow us to constrain its amplitude and location in the hrd .",
