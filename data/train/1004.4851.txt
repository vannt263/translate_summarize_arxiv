    "the intrinsic non perturbative nature of non zero temperature quantum field theories has been recognized for long @xcite .",
    "naive thermal perturbation theory can nevertheless be devised , both in imaginary and real time formalisms @xcite , but then , it promptly appears that , under certain circumstances , the original perturbative series must be re - organized .",
    "such an example of re - organization is provided by the so called _ resummation program _",
    "this program , @xmath0 for short , is a resummation scheme of the leading order thermal fluctuations which , in the literature , are known under the spell of _ hard thermal loops_. whenever one is calculating a physical process related to thermal green s functions whose external / internal legs are _ soft _ , it is mandatory to trade the naive thermal perturbation theory for the @xmath0 .",
    "the softness alluded to above , refers to momenta on the order of the soft scale @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , the temperature , stands for the _ hard _ scale and @xmath3 for any relevant ( bare / renormalized ) and small enough coupling constant .",
    "the @xmath0 which has been set up in order to remedy an obvious lack of completeness of the naive thermal perturbation theory , has produced interesting , gauge - invariant results .",
    "it is true , however , that it has also met difficulties in the infrared regime of the theories @xcite .",
    "one of these difficulties is the sixteen years old hot qcd collinear singularity problem : when one calculates the soft photon emission rate out of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at thermal equilibrium , the resummation program is in order , but it delivers an answer which is plagued with a collinear singularity @xcite .    the hot qcd collinear singularity problem has long been quoted an important issue of the quantum field theory non - zero temperature context , and only two years after its discovery , had already become textbook material @xcite .",
    "it is recorded as a serious obstruction to the high temperature effective perturbation theory , and has motivated several attempts of solution @xcite .    among the solutions that have been proposed , the latter , in ref.8 , has been adopted widely : it relies on a gauge - invariant introduction of so - called _ thermal asymptotic masses _ in either bosonic and fermionic sectors of the theories .",
    "the thermal asymptotic masses are on the order of the soft scale , @xmath1 , and as any mass , they are expected to _ screen _ the logarithmic collinear singularity under consideration .    however , despite the fact that the introduction of such masses suffers from a lack of justification , the singularity screening it provides reveals itself not efficient enough beyond the stage of a one loop calculation , and indeed , the problem bounces back .",
    "this fate is due to the mechanism of _ collinear enhancement _",
    ", able to render higher number of loop contributions as important , if no more important than lower number of loop calculations , @xcite .",
    "needless to say that in such a dramatic situation , the resummation program comes out deprived of any reliability and predictive power , and that , by the time of f. gelis s thesis striking results , @xcite , people involved in the matter were almost driven to despair .",
    "this has lead some authors to explore the possibility that extra topologies of graphs be considered that could compensate for the logarithmic collinear singularity of the original diagrams @xcite ; and one of us , to get back to the original derivation of the hot qcd collinear singularity problem [ 11 ] .    in this latter instance , @xcite , it was discovered that the collinear singularity original derivation hinged upon an incorrect sequence of two mathematical steps to be taken , namely , an angular integration followed by a prescription of discontinuity , to proceed along the correct sequence .",
    "in particular , it could be proven that the diagrams involving 1- _ effective soft photon - quark - anti - quark vertex _",
    ", the other one bare , came out a regular quantity , in contradistinction to the original derivation where the incorrect sequence was followed : of course , this could be taken as a serious invitation to revisit the whole problem within the correct sequence .",
    "unfortunately , the much more involved 2-effective vertex diagram remained an issue because of the incredibly long and difficult entwined angular integrations it entails .",
    "however , that issue was the more decisive as the original collinear singularity was explicitly due to that very diagram and to no other .",
    "in other words ,",
    "so long as the 2-effective vertex diagram was not thoroughly calculated within the correct sequence , the hot qcd collinear singularity problem could not be considered a fixed one .",
    "fixing definitely that issue is the task which is achieved in the present article .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is a short reminder of the collinear singularity problem met in hot qcd .",
    "this section will also serve the purpose of introducing the quantities of interest as well as our notations . in section 3 ,",
    "the kinematics and the general structure of the calculations involving @xmath4- and @xmath5- effective vertex diagrams are set up .    in order to reach sound conclusions , meticulous calculations of @xmath6- and @xmath5-effective vertex diagrams",
    "must be carried out .",
    "such is the case of the former in section 4 , and of the latter in section 5 .",
    "eventually , our conclusions are drawn in section 6 , whereas two appendices complete the article .    throughout the article",
    ", we will be using the convention of upper case letters for quadrimomenta and lower case ones for their components , writing , for example @xmath7 .",
    "our conventions for labelling internal and external momenta can be read off figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "this sixteen years old issue is the following . the soft real photon emission rate out of a quark - gluon plasma in thermal equilibrium involves the calculation of the quantity @xmath9the discontinuity is to be taken in the energy variable @xmath10 , by forming the difference of @xmath11 and @xmath12-indiced @xmath13-dependent quantities , and within standard notations , fermionic _ htl _ self energies , effective propagators and vertices are respectively given by    @xmath14    @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17where @xmath18 is the lightlike four vector @xmath19 . as ( 2.4 )",

    "it is this diagram which is now being analyzed within the correct sequence of eq.(3.1 ) , where the angular average is to be performed before the discontinuity in @xmath10 is taken .",
    "one gets @xmath41where we have used @xmath42 , whereas a factor of @xmath5 accounts for the two @xmath4-effective vertex diagrams , which contribute equally . defining @xmath43",

    "now , in view of ( 3.8 ) and ( 3.9 ) , three types of contribution to ( 3.4 ) and ( 3.7 ) have to be considered : ( i ) contributions involving the product of distributions @xmath57 and @xmath58 , ( ii ) crossed contributions involving the product of distributions @xmath59 and @xmath60 , ( iii ) contributions involving the product of distributions @xmath61 and @xmath60 . in case ( i )",
    ", there is no infrared singularity problem at all , because none of the quantities @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 can ever vanish over the whole integration range .",
    "this will be exemplified to a large extent in the sequel .",
    "case ( iii ) has been studied thoroughly and shown to lead to singularity free contributions , @xcite .",
    "the intermediate , crossed case ( ii ) remains to be studied .",
    "the two crossed possibilities contribute equally and the crossed term @xmath66 comes out to be proportional to the product of distributions @xmath67 where the residues at the quasi - particle poles read as @xmath68 the second delta is clearly incompatible with the overall @xmath69 : it would require that @xmath63 be strictly positive , whereas it fixes a strictly negative term of @xmath64 . since @xmath70 ,",
    "this is impossible to satisfy at @xmath71 .",
    "there is no incompatibility with the first delta function which fixes @xmath63 and @xmath64 at strictly positive values , whereas @xmath72 can reach zero from below .",
    "the constraint of @xmath73 is common to both contributions appearing inside the curly brackets of either ( 3.4 ) or ( 3.7 ) . defining @xmath74 , with the two cosines @xmath75 , and @xmath76 ,",

    "/m as functions of k / m ]    one can deduce that @xmath80then , since @xmath81 , so is therefore @xmath82 , which gives @xmath83and so @xmath84the kinematics inherited from this common constraint restrict the integration domain to the boundaries @xmath85for the first terms in the curly brackets of both ( 3.4 ) and ( 3.7 ) , proportional to the products @xmath86 , an extra constraint of @xmath69 comes into play in view of ( 3.9 ) , and modifies ( 3.15 ) into an integration domain bounded by the relations @xmath87actually , the arguments developed after ( 3.9 ) do not apply to the second terms in the curly brackets of ( 3.4 ) and ( 3.7 ) , the ones proportional to @xmath88-contributions ; but it turns out that the terms of @xmath89 , for @xmath90 , effectively restore the previous @xmath69-constraint , as can be read off ( 5.1.23 ) and ( 5.2.37 ) below , so as to make of ( 3.16 ) the effective integration domain of the required resummation .    note",
    "that these inequalities automatically preclude any risk of collinear singularity at @xmath91 , but not at @xmath92 , where the collinear singularity was historically located @xcite .",
    "this case is given by eq.(3.4 ) , with the angular function @xmath93 given by ( 3.3 ) . in this case , the explicit calculation is quite simple .",
    "one gets @xmath94and so @xmath95    the imaginary part of @xmath96 can accordingly be written as the full expression @xmath97and is to be integrated over the domain ( 3.16 ) .",
    "let us begin with focusing on the first curly bracket of ( 4.3 ) : because @xmath98 as well as @xmath64 are strictly positive , only the logarithm of @xmath99 in the integrand , is able to yield a diverging behavior , and there are two of them .",
    "such a potentially dangerous behavior is for example the one of @xmath100where ( 3.11 ) has been used .",
    "however , at @xmath101 , the logarithmic divergence of the integrand is suppressed by a factor of @xmath102 in @xmath103 , so that the case of @xmath104 only must be considered whose potentially singular part reads @xmath105because @xmath106 is a fairly complicated , implicit function of @xmath37 , the last line of ( 4.5 ) is certainly hard to get exactly .",
    "fortunately this is not necessary either : it is sufficient that , in a neighborhood of @xmath107 , the second line of ( 4.5 ) defines a regular function of @xmath10 , say @xmath108 .",
    "this condition is met indeed , and since this situation is generic of all the potentially singular behaviors attached to logarithms of @xmath109 , a proof is sketched in appendix a. then , in order to isolate the potentially singular behavior of ( 4.5 ) , one may re - write the second line of ( 4.5 ) as the sum @xmath110+f(p)$ ] . whereas the first term , @xmath110 $ ] annihilates the potentially divergent behavior of the logarithms , @xmath111^{c}$ ] , the second , @xmath112 , gives a contribution proportional to the would be singular part of ( 4.5 ) , that is to @xmath113where ( 3.9 ) has been used , and where @xmath114 is the _ logarithm - integral function of x _ , @xcite .",
    "for the second term of ( 4.3 ) , the one involving the discontinuity in @xmath10 , it is immediate to see that the same arguments apply , over the same integration range ( 3.16 ) , with the same conclusion .",
    "eventually , in contradistinction with the _ historical _ improper derivation , the imaginary part of @xmath96 comes out singularity free when evaluated along the correct sequence of discontinuity and angular average operations .",
    "though crucial , since the original collinear singularity is explicitly due to it , this case is far more difficult because , as an unavoidable step , the angular function @xmath47 of ( 3.6 ) must be known exactly .",
    "let us begin with recalling this function @xmath48and define @xmath115 .",
    "the function @xmath116 corresponds to the first two terms in the numerator of ( 3.6 ) .",
    "they are symmetric in the exchange of @xmath13 and @xmath117 and contribute equally .",
    "that is , @xmath118whereas @xmath119 is the function @xmath120we now cope exclusively with @xmath116 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath119 being orders of magnitude \" more difficult will be dealt with in subsection 5.2 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath116 to @xmath121 , is obtained by substituting @xmath116 for @xmath47 in ( 3.7 ) , and we begin with the @xmath122 -term .    - from ( 5.1 ) , a first part , coming from the term @xmath123 contributes to ( 3.7 ) the amount @xmath124where the `` self energy four - vector '' has components , @xmath125with @xmath126 and @xmath127 , the legendre functions @xmath128the label @xmath129 keeps on denoting one of the two _ retarded _ or _ advanced _ specifications of the real time formalism being used , and in the right hand sides of ( 5.1.4 ) these specifications are encoded in the logarithmic determinations . because of the delta distribution , @xmath130 , one of the self energies of ( 5.1.3 ) is the regular function , @xmath131 , whereas the other one , @xmath132 , entails the logarithmic components of ( 5.1.4 ) and ( 5.1.5 ) . over the integration range of @xmath133 , though themselves divergent , but logarithmically only , these components lead to the same singularity free result as obtained in section 4 , eq.(4.6 ) .",

    "again , the integrand wildest behavior  is the one of the logarithms of @xmath99 , which , integrated over the interval @xmath137 leads to regular contributions .    - the same conclusion holds for the third term in the big parenthesis of ( 5.1 ) , which , easily obtained out of the second one , is quoted here for the sake of completeness , @xmath138note that the last term of ( 5.1.8 ) is not induced by an error of _ copy and paste _ , but reflects the symmetry of @xmath139 under the exchange of @xmath117 and @xmath13 , since @xmath140 .",

    "the @xmath116 -contributions to the 2-effective vertex part of the soft photon emission rate involve another piece , the one associated to the term @xmath169 .    as made clear by a simple inspection of the @xmath10-dependences in ( 5.1.3 ) , ( 5.1.7 ) and ( 5.1.8 ) , taking the discontinuity in @xmath10 just amounts to substitute a term of @xmath170 for a logarithmic term of @xmath165 $ ] , all of the other discontinuities being zero or giving zero : such is for example the case of the discontinuity proportional to @xmath171 which has no support in ( 3.16 ) .",

    "then , one finds that the integrals @xmath241 and @xmath242 are not on the order of @xmath246 , but are regular functions of @xmath37 at @xmath232 , @xmath247where the dots stand for higher orders in @xmath248 .    - likewise , and thanks to the very same compensations as those at work in the case of @xmath241 and @xmath242 , one finds that @xmath243 and @xmath244 are not on the order of @xmath249 , but at worse , on the order of @xmath250 , @xmath251 the functions @xmath243 and @xmath244",
    "also depend on the integrals ( 5.2.20 ) and ( 5.2.21 ) which , like @xmath241 and @xmath242 , are regular functions of @xmath37 , at @xmath232 . in the case of ( 5.2.20 ) for example , one gets , @xmath252 the same applies to ( 5.2.21 ) , and another similar example of potential collinear singularity compensation will be given below .",
    "- eventually , a third useful property is that the four combinations @xmath253 are able to decrease by one unit the power @xmath214 of any @xmath239- contributions appearing in @xmath254 and @xmath255 ( at @xmath256 , combinations ( 5.2.43 ) are on the order of @xmath257 , in view of ( 5.2.40 ) ) .",
    "one is now in a position so as to analyze the contributions to ( 5.2.39 ) of any of the five terms composing @xmath258 . for the previous form of ( 5.2.39 ) , it may be more convenient now , to substitute the expression @xmath259where the @xmath260 denote the five contributions displayed in ( 5.2.8 ) , ( 5.2.9 ) , ( 5.2.10 ) , ( 5.2.16 ) and ( 5.2.25)-(5.2.27 )",
    ".    - @xmath261 , the fifth term of ( 5.2.4 ) , given in ( 5.2.10 ) and the array of coefficients ( 5.2.11)-(5.2.15 ) , is a linear combination of regular functions of @xmath37 , @xmath262 and @xmath55 over the full integration range ( 3.16 ) , and its contribution to ( 5.2.44 ) is singularity free",
    ".    - @xmath263 , the second term of ( 5.2.4 ) , given in ( 5.2.8 ) , appears singular in the collinear regime of @xmath232 .",
    "but it is not so , and at @xmath92 ( as well as at @xmath264 ) the right hand side of ( 5.2.8 ) behaves like @xmath265 and therefore , its integration over @xmath37 is collinear singularity free .    -",
    "so is also the contribution to ( 5.2.44 ) of @xmath266 , the first term of ( 5.2.4 ) . as displayed by ( 5.2.9 ) , in effect , this term is the square power of the previous one . in view of ( 5.2.45 ) , its integration on @xmath37 is collinear singularity free either",
    ".    - @xmath267 , the fourth term of ( 5.2.4 ) is given by ( 5.2.16 ) , and eqs.(5.2.40 ) , ( 5.2.41 ) guarantee that this term lead to collinear singularity free contributions to ( 5.2.44 ) .",
    "- @xmath268 , the third term of ( 5.2.4 ) is given by ( 5.2.25 ) , ( 5.2.26 ) and ( 5.2.27 ) .",
    "the first part , ( 5.2.25 ) , leads to a regular contribution in virtue of ( 5.2.40 ) and ( 5.2.41 ) .",
    "the second part , ( 5.2.26 ) , leads to a regular contribution in virtue of ( 5.2.40 ) and ( 5.2.41 ) , and also in virtue of the first combination of ( 5.2.43 ) taken at @xmath269 . the third part , ( 5.2.27 )",
    ", leads to a regular contribution in virtue of ( 5.2.40 ) and ( 5.2.41 ) , and also in virtue of the two combinations of ( 5.2.43 ) taken at @xmath269 ; to wit , from the second line : @xmath270where ( 5.2.41 ) has been used .",
    "to summarize , relevant regroupings of the initial @xmath238-functions are able to display a full compensation of all _ potential _ collinear singularities ( both at @xmath92 and at @xmath264 ) : certainly , these fine tuning compensations , taking place among so many terms , do not show up by pure chance , and clearly , they support the reliability of the calculations that are presented here .    as illustrated in appendix b , collinear singularities would pass from _ potential _ to _ actual _ upon integration on @xmath37 , @xmath262 and @xmath55 , and not upon integration on @xmath37 alone .",
    "at this point , an important remark is in order .    in the range ( 3.16 ) ,",
    "an inspection of the remaining integrations has not revealed any further difficulties : the angular functions @xmath93 and @xmath271 display singular behaviours at the light cone @xmath272 ( of the logarithmic type for example ) , that do not compromise the regular character of the full integration over ( 3.16 ) .",
    "now , in this respect , it matters to emphasize that a complete compensation of potential or actual collinear singularities is of utmost importance .",
    "as displayed through appendix b , in effect , terms of @xmath239 do not yield any collinear singularity _ as such_. instead , out of the remaining @xmath262 and @xmath55-integrations , potential collinear singularities generate further logarithmic and power - law singularities , as well as products of them .",
    "what is more , these further fake singularities can be proven to receive no screening / removal at all from an improved @xmath22-effective action resumming _ asymptotic thermal masses _ along both bosonic and fermionic lines , @xcite . this very unusual circumstance , fully understandable though , is demonstrated in appendix b.    these examples therefore , are highly suggestive of the crucial importance of potential / actual collinear singularity compensations , if any . missing the completeness of collinear singularity compensations , results into severe further troubles : as suggested in appendix b , the collinear - enhancement mechanism and the related loop - expansion breaking , are very likely nothing else than some of these troubles .",
    "the hot qcd collinear singularity problem had to be revisited entirely , and were it not for the tedious calculations this revisitation requires , the task could have been achieved sooner .    as we have seen in effect , the thorough evaluation of entwined angular averages is very complicated and a lot of patient checkings is needed .",
    "this is the more so as , to our knowledge ( and ability ) at least , no mathematical program is really able to yield the full results of section 5.2 . getting them however , is the price to be paid in order to fix definitely that 16 years old issue ( experience shows in effect , that attempts at guessing the essential features of such complicated objects as those entwined angular averages , are doomed to failure ) .",
    "* - * in the first place , having proceeded , within the correct sequence , to a most careful analysis of the @xmath4- and @xmath5- effective vertex diagrams relevant to the soft photon emission rate out of a quark - gluon plasma at thermal equilibrium , we claim that the corresponding emission rate is singularity - free .",
    "the hot qcd collinear singularity problem simply does nt exist , and in textbooks , should no longer be presented as a serious obstruction to the resummation program .    as pinned up in @xcite ,",
    "the 1994s- famous divergent result , @xcite , is due to erroneous manipulations due to the fuzzy distinction made in our formalisms , between the prescriptions of _ discontinuity _ and _ imaginary part_. whereas the latter commutes with an integration process , by integration s linearity , the former does not , in general , because it is defined by a limiting procedure , @xcite .",
    "now , the prevalence of the discontinuity prescription over the imaginary part one has been advocated in ref.@xcite .",
    "* - * appendix b has revealed instructive aspects . to summarize , if for some reason , a complete compensation of ( potential or actual )",
    "collinear singularities is missed , then , the same drawbacks occur , as encountered by the improved effective perturbation theory :    - resummed asymptotic thermal masses , bosonic and fermionic , do not provide enough screening , and , due to power - law collinear - induced singularities , a full leading order emission rate calculation requires higher order diagrams .    - moreover , the required extra diagrams may clearly depend on the regulators that are choosen in order to quantify the collinear - induced singularities of the original diagrams .",
    "an unavoidable arbitrariness is thus introduced in the emission rate leading order completion , supposing under control that extra diagrams are determined at the exclusion of any others .    - and last but not least , extra diagrams are also expected to compensate for original singularities , @xcite .",
    "but we have seen here , how very peculiar to the diagram under consideration , are the collinearly generated singularities .",
    "now , infrared / collinear cancellations between diagrams of different topologies , @xcite , in a non - abelian context , what is more , @xcite , is a highly non - trivial conjecture , if not an exceptional one : if that possibility can be thought of as reliable , at least so long as the stronger infrared singularities are concerned , @xcite , there is no guarantee whatsoever that it could be so in the case of sub - leading ones ; quite on the contrary , @xcite .    - it is therefore suggested that all of the above long known difficulties , express an incomplete compensation of initial collinear singularities , and nothing else .",
    "this is the more likely so , as the calculations presented here are able , among so many terms , to exhibit a fine tuning compensation of all of the possible collinear singularities : a cogent enough result , which can not happen just by chance .",
    "accordingly , right from hot qcd first principles , the finite contributions that remain provide us with a sound , reliable basis for a complete leading order estimate of the soft photon emission rate out of a qgp at thermal equilibrium , @xcite .",
    "this perspective should be of interest in view of rhic and lhc experimental runs .",
    "@xmath273where the denominator has been expressed as @xmath274 .",
    "we recall that @xmath275 and @xmath276 . in order to see the regular character of @xmath108 in a neighborhood of @xmath107 ,",
    "one may expand the constraint of @xmath277 , @xmath278where the dots stand for higher order corrections in @xmath109 , and obtain @xmath279note that instead of @xmath280 , which in addition to @xmath281 , ( 3.16 ) , would also preclude any risk of potentially singular behavior at @xmath107 , one allows for @xmath71 in view of the step - function @xmath69 appearing in ( 3.10 ) .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath282 , which at @xmath283 is guaranteed , provided the inequality @xmath284 be satisfied . by picking up a value of @xmath37 smaller than 1 ( at @xmath264 in effect ,",
    "any term in the expansion ( a.3 ) would be zero because of the argument of eq.(5.2.38 ) , the latter inequality allows for the constraint of @xmath285 to have a non - empty support in the integration domain ( 3.16 ) .      in this appendix",
    ", it is assumed that a full compensation of collinear singularities is not obtained , so that in ( 5.2.39 ) , some function @xmath216 remains , hereafter denoted by @xmath286 , whose behaviour at @xmath92 does not compensate for the potentially dangerous factors of @xmath239 .",
    "what happens then ?    in order to examine the behavior of ( 5.2.39 ) in the collinear regime of @xmath287 , one can rely on the expansion @xcite @xmath288this expansion makes sense provided that @xmath289 , a condition that is met at @xmath287 , in view of ( 3.16 ) and in view also , of the relatively narrow phase - space extension of the resummation program , @xcite . without prejudice to our concern , @xmath290 allows us to replace in ( 5.2.39 ) , the factor @xmath291 by the constant @xmath292 , because one has , @xcite , @xmath293the contribution to ( 5.2.39 ) of the collinear regime @xmath287 therefore reads as @xmath294where the two zeros @xmath295 are @xmath296and where , bearing on the angle selected by the constraint @xmath297 , the condition @xmath298 restricts the original @xmath262-range to the interval @xmath299 $ ] .",
    "the ensuing integrations do not exist in the rigorous mathematical sense because of a pole at @xmath300 , and another one at @xmath301 , both induced by a potential collinear singularity at @xmath92 .",
    "as is often the case at non - zero temperature , @xcite , extra regularizations must be supplied .",
    "let it be done by shifting the pole at @xmath302 a small amount of @xmath303 , and the pole at @xmath301 , a small amount of @xmath304 .",
    "then , in @xmath305 , two values of @xmath214 come into play :      \\(ii ) at @xmath310 , to the two previous singular behaviours , @xmath311 , one must add singular contributions on the strength of @xmath312 it is worth remarking that these singular behaviours are generated by the @xmath92-collinear regime : whereas a genuine collinear singularity , as such , does not appear , a _ potentially _ singular collinear behaviour is at the origin of the _ actual _ singular terms developed by the remaining integrations on @xmath262 and @xmath55 .",
    "\\(iii ) an amazing feature revealed by this calculation is worth emphasizing .",
    "if one proceeds to improve the bosonic and fermionic @xmath22-effective actions in the sense of ref.@xcite , providing gluon and quark fields with asymptotic thermal masses @xmath313 and @xmath314 respectively , then , no change is brought to the above situation .",
    "contrarily to usual expectations , the singularities of @xmath315 and @xmath316 receive no screening from a resummation of asymptotic thermal masses .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "asymptotic thermal masses will affect the effective quark propagators , the @xmath317 of ( 2.2 ) , by substituing to ( 2.3 ) an improved version of the thermal self energy , @xmath318 where , @xmath319 and likewise , the effective photon - quark - quark vertex , the @xmath320 of ( 2.5 ) is improved in a similar way , @xcite , @xmath321    surprisingly enough , in the latter case , factors of @xmath322 , at @xmath306 and @xmath310 , are left the same as at @xmath323 , and collinear singularities at @xmath92 receive no screening . as inspection shows in effect ( section v.b ) ,",
    "this is so because those singular factors come exclusively from the @xmath324 , @xmath325 and @xmath326 pieces of the various functions to be integrated over @xmath327 $ ] : one has @xmath328 , ( 5.1.12 ) , and tables show that the ensuing integrations come out proportional to inverse powers of @xmath329 , @xcite .",
    "now , the function @xmath330 itself comes from the scalar product @xmath331 , where the vector @xmath332 is clearly unaffected by a shift of @xmath262 to @xmath333 , followed by an average over @xmath334 .      in the former case , quasi - particle poles , @xmath335 of eq.(3.8 ) ,",
    "are solutions of @xmath336 and with @xmath337 , will now become solutions of @xmath338 where the notation @xmath339 has been introduced as a shorthand to mean @xmath340 for this new equation to admit a new solution in the integration range of ( 3.16 ) , @xmath341 , the new terms composing it can not be an order of magnitude bigger than the remaining ones , and in view of @xmath342 , this observation imposes @xmath343 , that is , @xmath334 can not be smaller than @xmath3 . then , considering the @xmath344-fermionic line , relevant to the crossed possibilities of ( 3.10 ) , after some algebra , it is possible to re - write @xmath345 as , @xmath346 where the dots stand for higher orders in a small parameter development , the parameter @xmath347 . at @xmath348 ,",
    "this small parameter is on the order of @xmath349 , with @xmath343 .",
    "note that in @xmath350 , because of @xmath351 , we have now a slight modification of the average introduced in @xmath352 , @xmath353 a comparison of @xmath350 to @xmath354 shows that the former , whith respect to the same equation taken at @xmath323 , is modified an amount of relative magnitude @xmath355 which can still be taken as a small enough quantity .",
    "denoting by @xmath356 the solutions to @xmath350 taken at @xmath323 , this suggests to look for solutions to @xmath350 under the form of @xmath357and to analyze the consequence on the pole - location , coming from the new inherited constraint of @xmath358 .",
    "then , provided that the condition @xmath359is satisfied , one finds @xmath360where @xmath361 is a shorthand for @xmath362 .",
    "since @xmath362 complies with the expansion @xmath290 for @xmath37 in a neighbourhood of @xmath363 , this expansion can be used in @xmath364 so as to get @xmath365 and we note that @xmath366 complies with @xmath367 , @xmath368 since @xmath369 is proportional to @xmath370 , the new constraint , @xmath358 , will amount to re - define the pole at @xmath302 , @xmath371 with , obviously , the same conclusions @xmath315 and @xmath316 as at @xmath323 .    what can be learned out of this example",
    "apparently , that if a complete compensation of potential / actual collinear singularities is missed , then further singularities develop , and that a resummation of thermal asymptotic masses does not bring enough screening , to say the less . also , since some of the generated singularities are power - law , what should nt come as a surprise ( see ref.@xcite ) , it becomes obvious that , depending on the scale of the adopted regulators ( the @xmath303 and @xmath304 ) , higher number of loop diagrams will be found to be on the same orders of magnitude as elementary ones .",
    "needless to emphasize that these difficulties are of course very similar to those which are known to plague the @xmath22- improved effective perturbation theory , @xcite .",
    "note also that , depending on the scale of the adopted regulators , the extra diagrams that will become necessary to complete the full soft photon emission rate leading order , will differ .. and in any case , will be hoped to cancel out the original singularities , @xcite , .."
