    "the active binary capella ( @xmath3 aurigae , hd  34029 , hr  1708 ) was observed with the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) on the chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo ) .",
    "we present a first analysis of the spectra with the goals of demonstrating the hetgs performance , and of applying plasma diagnostics to infer physical parameters of the capella corona .",
    "a complementary analysis of the corona of capella based on high resolution spectra obtained using the cxo low energy transmission grating spectrometer ( letgs ) has been presented by @xcite .",
    "further analysis of diagnostic emission lines from these and other chandra grating data of capella are underway with the goal of obtaining refined temperature - dependent emission measures , abundances , and densities , leading to a self - consistent determination of the coronal structure .",
    "[ [ the - chandra - hetgs ] ] the chandra hetgs : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the high energy transmission grating assembly @xcite consists of an array of periodic gold microstructures that can be interposed in the converging x - ray beam just behind the chandra high resolution mirror assembly .",
    "when in place , the gratings disperse the x - rays according to wavelength , creating spectra that are recorded at the focal plane by the linear array of ccds designated acis - s .",
    "there are two different grating types , designated meg and heg , optimized for medium and high energies ( partially overlapping in spectral coverage ) .",
    "the hetgs provides spectral resolving power of @xmath4 - 1000 for point sources ( corresponding to a line fwhm of about 0.02   for meg , and 0.01   for heg ) and effective areas of  1 - 180 @xmath5 over the wavelength range 1.2 - 30    ( 0.4 - 10 kev ) .",
    "multiple overlapping orders are separated using the moderate energy resolution of the acis detector .",
    "the hetgs complements the letgs , which is optimized for lower energy x - rays .",
    "( for detailed descriptions of the instruments see http://chandra.harvard.edu )",
    ".    preliminary analysis of in - flight calibration data including those presented here indicates that the hetgs is performing as predicted prior to the chandra launch .",
    "the spectral resolution is as expected and effective areas are within 10% of the expected values except from 612  where there are systematic uncertainties of up to 20% .",
    "ongoing calibration efforts will reduce these uncertainties .",
    "[ [ the - coronal - structure - of - capella ] ] the coronal structure of capella : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    capella is an active binary system comprised of g1 and g8 giants in a 104 d orbit at a distance of 12.9 pc .",
    "the g1 star rotates with an @xmath6 d period @xcite .",
    "capella has been studied by many previous x - ray telescopes , including einstein @xcite , exosat @xcite ; rosat @xcite , beppo - sax @xcite , and asca @xcite .",
    "the fundamental parameters of capella , some activity indicators , and primary references may be found in @xcite .",
    "the corona of capella appears intermediate in temperature , being cooler than those of rs  cvn stars such as hr  1099 or ii  peg , but significantly hotter than a less active star like procyon .",
    "x - ray observations obtained at low to moderate spectral resolution are generally consistent with emission from an optically thin , collisionally dominated plasma with two temperature components @xcite .",
    "spectra obtained by the extreme ultraviolet explorer ( euve ) have provided more discriminating temperature diagnostics , showing plasma over a continuous range of temperatures , with the peak emission measure near @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "simultaneous measurements using euve and asca spectra did not require emission from plasma hotter than @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "euve observations show variability by factors of 3 to 4 in lines formed above @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "@xcite have estimated plasma electron densities in the range from @xmath10 to @xmath11 from lines of fe  xxi formed near @xmath12 , implying that the scale of the emitting volume is @xmath13 , although @xcite question the reliability of this diagnostic .",
    "@xcite use euv lines of fe  xviii to constrain the optical depth in the strong x - ray emission line , fe  xvii @xmath1415.014 , to @xmath15 .    from high - resolution uv spectra from the hubble space telescope",
    ", @xcite concluded that both stars have comparable coronal emission , based on measurements of the fe  xvii ( 1354 ) coronal forbidden line , and that the plasma is magnetically confined .",
    "thus the `` corona '' of capella is actually a composite of two `` coronae . ''",
    "we combined data from three hetgs observations ( from 1999 august 28 , september 24 & 25 ) for a total exposure of 89  ks .",
    "data were processed with the standard chandra x - ray center software ( versions from july 29 ( r4cu3upd2 ) and december 13 ( ciao 1.1 ) ) .",
    "the image of the dispersed spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "each photon is assigned a dispersion angle , @xmath16 , relative to the undiffracted zero - order image .",
    "the angle is related to the order , @xmath17 , and wavelength , @xmath14 , through the grating mean period , @xmath18 , by the grating equation , @xmath19 .",
    "the spectral order is determined using the acis - s ccd pulse height for each photon event ( with wide latitude to avoid sensitivity to variations in ccd gain or pulse height resolution ) .",
    "the positive and negative first orders were summed separately for heg and meg for all observations and divided by the effective areas to provide flux - calibrated spectra ( figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) . listed in table  [",
    "tab : linelist ] .",
    "the fe  xvii @xmath20 line strength is , within the uncertainties , identical to that observed in 1979 with the einstein crystal spectrometer by @xcite , while the o viii @xmath21 line is roughly half the previous value .",
    "[ [ emission - measure - distribution ] ] emission measure distribution : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    some properties of the coronal temperature structure can be deduced from a preliminary analysis of the spectrum .",
    "the data warrant a full analysis of the volume emission measure distribution with temperature , @xmath22 , ( @xmath23 in which @xmath24 is the electron density of plasma at temperature @xmath25 which occupies the volume , @xmath26 ) , which will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "as table  [ tab : linelist ] illustrates , the spectrum contains lines from different elements in a range of ionization states , demonstrating that the emitting plasma has a broad range of temperature .",
    "further evidence of multi - temperature emission comes from two line ratios .",
    "first , ratios of h - like to he - like resonance lines , o  viii / vii , mg  xii / xi , and si  xiv / xiii indicate ionization ratios corresponding to @xmath27 = 6.55 - 6.60 , 6.75 - 6.85 , and 6.95 - 7.00 , respectively .",
    "second , the he - like ions provide temperature - sensitive ratios involving the resonance ( @xmath28 ) , forbidden ( @xmath29 ) and intersystem ( @xmath30 ) lines @xcite . for the observed o  vii ,",
    "mg  xi , and si  xiii lines , the ratio @xmath31 corresponds to temperatures @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively , using the theoretical models of smith et al .",
    "( 1998 , in the low density limit ) . in both cases ,",
    "the ratios indicate that the corona has a broad range of temperature .",
    "an approximate upper envelope to the true @xmath35 distribution is given by the family of curves formed by plotting the ratio of line strength to corresponding emissivity for a collection of lines .",
    "for a given element , its abundance affects only the overall normalization of the envelope of all lines from that element . for this initial analysis",
    ", we assumed solar abundances @xcite , which is consistent with previous analyses except possibly for ne @xcite .",
    "the vem envelope of figure  [ fig : vemt ] , indicatates that plasma must be present over nearly a decade in temperature .",
    "the absence of lines from he - like and h - like ions of fe provides an upper limit to the @xmath35 above @xmath36 .",
    "although the envelope does not trace closely the peaked distribution derived from euv lines , such a distribution is not excluded ,    [ [ density - diagnostics ] ] density diagnostics : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the he - like @xmath37 ratio is primarily sensitive to density using the theoretical line ratios of smith et al . ( 1998 ) , our measured o  vii ratio of @xmath38 implies an electron density within the range @xmath39@xmath40 .",
    "similarly , the mg  xi and si  xiii ratios of @xmath41 and @xmath42 give upper limits near @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "we note that our ratio @xmath37 for o  vii is somewhat lower than that obtained by @xcite from letgs spectra .",
    "the hetgs and letgs observations were not simultaneous ; however , based on evidence from prior euve observations @xcite , we would be surprised if this difference represented actual changes in the mean coronal plasma density .",
    "instead , we suggest that this results from different treatements of the continuum plus background , which particularly affects the strength of the intercombination line .",
    "these x - ray data confirm that capella s corona contains plasma at multiple temperatures in the accessible range from @xmath45 to @xmath46 , and set stringent constraints on the amount of plasma hotter than @xmath47 at the time of this observation .",
    "these properties are generally consistent with the results found with euve and asca @xcite and the line strengths are close those seen 20 years earlier by @xcite .",
    "the preliminary results presented here have implications for the structure of capella s corona : they suggest that the characteristic dimensions of the coronal loops at @xmath48 are small compared to the stellar radius , @xmath49 . for simple semi - circular loops of constant circular cross - section of radius @xmath28",
    ", we use the measured density and @xmath35 for oxygen to estimate loop heights @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the ratio of @xmath28 to loop length in units of 0.1 , and @xmath52 is @xmath53 the number of loops .",
    "detailed loop modeling of @xcite also required compact structures , though variable cross - section loops were needed to increase the proportion of hot to cool plasma .",
    "work at mit was supported by nasa through the hetg contract nas8 - 38249 and through smithsonian astrophysical observatory ( sao ) contract svi61010 for the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) .",
    "jjd and nsb were supported by nasa nas8 - 39083 to sao for the cxc .",
