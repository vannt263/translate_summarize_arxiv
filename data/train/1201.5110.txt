    "transverse instability of a bunch in a ring accelerator has been considered independently by pellegrini @xcite and sands @xcite with synchrotron oscillations and some internal degrees of freedom of the bunch taken into account ( `` head - tail instability '' ) .",

    "@xcite has led to the conclusion that almost all head - tail modes are prone to landau damping till then the space charge tune shift is about twice less then the synchrotron tune .",

    "the lowest ( rigid ) mode is the only universal exception from the rule being potentially unstable with any space charge .",
    "sometimes 12 next modes can demonstrate similar behavior , in dependence on the bunch shape .",
    "however , no wakefield was included in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite in fact , so the results might be interpreted only as conditions which permit the bunch instability but do not determine its characteristics completely .",
    "effects of short wakes were actually studied in ref  @xcite where the instability growth rate has been found at different bunch parameters like its length , chromaticity , etc .",
    "transverse modes coupling instability was considered in the work as well , and it has been shown that this more rigorous effect can be caused only by positive wake ( for comparison , resistive wall creates a negative wake ) .",
    "a single bunch was investigated in the mentioned articles because only short - range forces have been accepted in all the cases .",
    "more general theory is developed in this paper where a bunched beam with arbitrary number of the bunches is examined taking into account the space charge , intra - bunch and bunch - to - bunch interactions .",
    "both kinds of the interactions affect the beam eigenmodes and the instability growth rate , although one of them can dominate is specific situation . just from this standpoint the common used terms like `` collective modes instability '' or `` head - tail instability ''",

    "it is pertinent to dwell upon the different character of the chromatic effects in coasting and bunched beams .    in first case",
    ", chromaticity leads to a spread of incoherent betatron frequencies which phenomenon can cause landau damping resulting in total suppressions ( prevention ) of instability .",
    "in contrast with this , average momenta of all the particles are equalized in the bunch through synchrotron oscillations . in such conditions",
    ", chromaticity does not provide a systematic tune spread and can not bring about landau damping at once .",
    "there is no questions that additional slip of betatron phases of particles with respect to the coherent field phase affects the interaction and can change the instability growth rate . as it follows from fig .  6 , switch of the instability peaks to the higher internal modes is the most descriptive result of this .",
    "however , it is necessary to take into account also other then chromaticity factors which can result in landau damping . in particular , space charge tune spread itself can produce this effect in bunched beams . as it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite@xcite , the higher internal modes are more sensitive to this kind of landau damping .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the above mentioned shift of the instability peaks is capable to suppress all internal bunch modes except the rigid one which is not prone to this kind of the damping @xcite .",
    "however , this problem can not be solved in frames of the boxcar model which ignores this part of the tune spread at all .",
    "therefore , we postpone its detailed analysis to sec .",
    "vi where more realistic gaussian distribution will be invoked .",
    "a peculiarity of a single bunch beam is that its instability is possible in a restricted region of parameters . as it follows from fig .",
    "1 at @xmath104 ,  imaginary part of the coefficients @xmath105  and @xmath106  is positive at @xmath107 .",
    "it means that , without chromaticity , the instability is feasible only if betatron tune is located between half - integer and next integer ( e.g. @xmath108  but not 0.25 ) .",
    "this result was first obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite  for a short bunch where the chromaticity was ignored by the model . actually , it is apparent from eq .",
    "( 16 ) that the chromaticity is an essential factor , mainly because it triggers the head - tail interaction .",
    "for example , without chromaticity the bunch is quite stable at @xmath109 .",
    "however , the rigid mode becomes unstable if @xmath110  obtaining the growth rate  im@xmath111   ( first term in this formula is the head - tail contribution , and second one  turn by turn interaction ) .",
    "of course , chromaticity of opposite sigh could prevent such a situation but higher modes instability would be enforced by this , as it follows from fig .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( 16 )  is a part of the collective interaction which describes the field variation of preceding bunches inside the considered one .",
    "actually , only the nearest bunch gives a noticeable contribution to this part so that the result does not depend on number of bunches , in practice .",
    "influence of this addition looks much like to the head - tail interaction which statement can be checked by comparison of figs .  5 and 7 .",
    "however , the effect strongly depends on collective mode as it is described by the coefficient @xmath47 . for the example above , its contribution to the rigid mode instability is about @xmath112  which is less then the `` usual '' head - tail effect in order of magnitude .",
    "probably , this part of the resistive wake is negligible at any conditions .",
    "the boxcar model gives a broad outlook of the problem but maybe it omits some important details being not sufficiently realistic itself .",
    "therefore another point of view is developed in this section based on the approach @xmath113  which is rather characteristic of many proton machines . as it is shown in previous section and illustrated by fig .  3",
    ", space charge suppresses all the modes @xmath114  in this limit .",
    "therefore the following results are actually concerned only with the modes @xmath115  which will be denoted later simply as @xmath116 .",
    "following ref.@xcite with resistive wakefield added , one can show that the space part of this function satisfies the equation : @xmath117 \\bar y'(\\tau)+\\frac{\\nu(\\delta q+\\nu)}{q_s^2 }   \\bar y\\nonumber\\\\   = \\frac{q_0\\delta q \\exp(i\\lambda\\theta_0\\tau)}{q_s^2 }   \\;\\bigg[-2\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\theta_0}}\\int_\\tau^1 \\frac{y(\\tau')\\,d\\tau ' }   { \\sqrt{\\tau'-\\tau}}\\hspace{15mm}\\nonumber\\\\   + \\sqrt{m}\\left(v_1\\hspace{-1mm}\\int_{-1}^1 y(\\tau')\\,d\\tau'-v_2b           \\int_{-1}^1 y(\\tau')(\\tau'\\hspace{-1mm}-\\hspace{-1mm}\\tau)\\,d\\tau'\\right)\\bigg]\\;\\;\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath118 as it is shown in ref .",

    "however , it would be a premature conclusion because _ the space charge tune spread is ignored at all in the boxcar model_. meanwhile , at certain situations the spread can cause landau damping and suppress many unstable modes of a real bunch , as it has been shown in ref .",
    "the rigid intra - bunch mode is the only occasion when this mechanism does not work and can not prevent instability at any combination of parameters .",
    "unfortunately , at present the problem is adequately covered only in the limiting cases @xmath74  and @xmath70 . in first case , this kind of landau damping really works and suppresses almost all internal modes @xcite .",
    "however , the mechanism is turned off in opposite limiting case which was just the subject of previous section .",
    "the only conclusion can be done from these facts : this stabilization mechanism has a threshold character and actually begin to work at @xmath178 .",
    "the goal of this section is to get more exact estimation of the thresholds .",
    "because the space charge will be treated here as a promoting and dominating factor , the wakefield is excluded from the analysis .",
    "it should be reminded preliminary that landau damping arises when coherent frequency penetrates rather deeply in a region of incoherent tunes of the system .",
    "then the particles which own tunes are located below or above the coherent tune could be exited in contra - phases by the coherent field , transforming its energy to the incoherent form ( beam heating ) .",
    "such a mechanism affects the beam decoherence and creates the instability threshold .",
    "well known practical recommendation follows from this statement for coasting beams : incoherent tune spread should exceed the space charge tune shift to avoid the instability . in principle",
    ", a wake field ( e.g. the resistive wall contribution ) affects this criterion , however , its influence is small in practice if the space charge dominates in the impedance budget .",
    "the last is just the case of our study .",
    "an additional important property of bunched beams is that , with a coherent frequency @xmath2 , the particles undergo an influence of harmonics of frequencies @xmath179  where @xmath180   is synchrotron frequency , and @xmath181  is integer .",
    "an intense energy transfer is possible if any of these frequencies falls in the incoherent region .",
    "fast look in fig .",
    "2 reveals that harmonics @xmath182  have the most chances to do this .",
    "therefore , more informative graph can be obtained from fig .  2 by a transformation of each curve @xmath183  to the @xmath184 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .  13 by the solid lines of the same color as in fig .  2 .    truncation.,width=340 ]    averaged over synchrotron phases incoherent tunes of the truncated gaussian bunch lie in the region @xmath185",
    ". drawing corresponding boundary line in fig .  13 and assuming that the coherent tunes of gaussian bunch have about the same behavior as in the boxcar model , one can make the conclusions : ( i ) the lowest ( rigid ) mode ( 0,0 ) is unstable with any @xmath81 ; ( ii ) the higher modes @xmath186  can be unstable at @xmath187 ; ( iii ) the more is @xmath57  the less is corresponding threshold of @xmath81 ;   ( iv ) all higher radial modes like @xmath188  are stable in any case .",
    "these conclusions are in a reasonable agreement with results of ref .",
    "@xcite , according which only the rigid mode ( 0,0 ) of gaussian bunch is unstable at @xmath74",
    ".   one can anticipate from fig .",
    "( 13 ) that thresholds of all other modes are located at @xmath189 .",
    "it is a region where the low @xmath81  approximation could be fitted to refine the thresholds of gaussian bunch . to accomplish this , we consider eq .",
    "( 23 ) with @xmath53  but without the additional simplification @xmath190 . correspondingly , boundary conditions ( 27 ) should be changed by the following one : @xmath191 obtained eigentunes are plotted in fig .",
    "( 13 ) by dashed lines above the gaussian incoherent boundary .",
    "the crossing points which are the expected thresholds of the head - tail modes are presented in table 1 .",
    ".instability thresholds of gaussian bunch with @xmath142  truncation ( lower radial modes ( n , n ) ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     distributions with more abrupt bunch boundaries demonstrate similar behavior but have higher thresholds .",
    "for example , three modes of parabolic bunch retain the stability at @xmath192  @xcite .",
    "the boxcar bunch is an extreme case which is unaffected by this sort of damping at all .",
    "an important conclusion follows from this or similar table , concerning an influence of chromaticity in real conditions . as might be expected from figs .  6 and 11 ,",
    "an increase of chromaticity should not affect drastically the instability growth rate because its main effect is a simple switch of the bunch oscillations from a lower internal mode to a higher one .",
    "for example , it follows from fig .",
    "11 that the most unstable internal modes of gaussian bunch are : @xmath193  at @xmath194 , and @xmath195  at @xmath196 ,   in both cases the instability growth rate being about 0.45 in used relative units ( the head - tail contribution is neglected in the estimations because it is reasonably small in a multi - bunch beam ) .",
    "however , now we must take into account that these results were obtained at @xmath197 .",
    "let us consider the case @xmath198  as an another example .",
    "then the modes @xmath199  can not appear being suppressed by landau damping .",
    "generally , only 0th and 1st internal modes could be unstable in this case , and chromaticity @xmath200  is sufficient to suppress both of them that is to reach a total beam stability .",
    "of course , table 1 is only an estimation of the thresholds because approximate eq .",
    "( 23 ) lies in its foundation .",
    "it would be a good idea to solve more general eq .",
    "( 7 ) with arbitrary @xmath6  and @xmath201 ,  and to use the results for exact instability thresholds of realistic bunches . note that all eigennumbers of this equation are real .",
    "therefore , the lack of regular solutions with real @xmath127  at some combination of synchrotron frequency and space charge tune shift would be a sign of landau damping .",
    "however , the boxcar model is the only solved case at present .",
    "transverse instability of a bunched beam is studied with synchrotron oscillations , space charge , and wakefield taken into account .",
    "resistive wall wakefield is considered as the most universal and practically important case .",
    "however , many results have a common sense and , with small changes , can be adapted to other wakes .",
    "boxcar model of the bunch is extensively used in the paper to get a general outline of the problem in wide range of parameters .",
    "a realistic gaussian distribution is invoked in some cases for comparison and more detailed investigations of important problems like landau damping .",
    "eigenfunctions and eigentunes of the beam are investigated with both intra - bunch and inter - bunch interactions taken into account .",
    "contributions of the interactions to the instability growth rate are studied over a wide range of the parameters , including effects of the bunch length and chromaticity .",
    "it is shown that known head - tail and collective modes instabilities are the extreme cases when one type of the interaction certainly dominates",
    ". however , an essential influence of the intra - bunch degrees of freedom on the collective instabilities is especially marked and investigated in detail .",
    "in particular , it is shown that a variability of the internal bunch modes explains why the instability growth rate depends on the bunch parameters including space charge tune shift , synchrotron tune , bunch length , and chromaticity .",
    "it is emphasized that the space charge tune spread can cause landau damping and suppress the instability ( other than the space charge sources of the tune spread are not considered in the paper ) .",
    "the phenomenon appears at rather large ratio of synchrotron frequency to the space charge tune shift , lower internal modes obtaining the stability at larger the ratio .",
    "several modes of gaussian bunch are considered in the paper , and their thresholds are estimated by comparison of the limiting cases .",
