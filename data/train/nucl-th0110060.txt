    "the experimental knowledge of electromagnetic form factors of the neutron is of basic interest for testing model or finally qcd based predictions .",
    "quite intensive experimental efforts are planned  @xcite and have been undertaken to extract these form factors from electron scattering on the deuteron  @xcite and @xmath3he  @xcite . in @xcite the magnetic neutron form factor @xmath4 has been extracted from the process @xmath0 at @xmath5= 0.1 and 0.2 @xmath6 . the analysis of the data relied on precise solutions of the 3n faddeev equations for @xmath3he and the 3n continuum , thereby using modern nuclear forces and consistent mesonic exchange currents .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath4 agreed perfectly with results extracted from the cross section ratio @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the experimental data for higher @xmath5-values have not yet been analyzed in the same framework because it has to be expected that relativistic corrections will play a significant role and the theoretical framework for that extension has not yet been settled enough to be reliably applicable .",
    "this is an important challenge and task for theory .    in the case of",
    "@xmath2 the experiments  @xcite for the process @xmath1 had the aim to extract the electric form factor of the neutron .",
    "the analysis , however , leaves more questions of reliability open than in case of @xmath4 . around @xmath5= 0.35 @xmath6 a first result @xcite",
    "was based on the simple assumption that polarized @xmath3he can be considered to be a polarized neutron .",
    "this was later corrected by a faddeev calculation @xcite , however without taking mec s into account .",
    "also relativistic effects in that faddeev calculation were not included , though they might be not negligible .",
    "the corrections induced by final state interactions ( fsi ) turned out to be substantial and moved the original value towards the region of @xmath2-values found in the experiments based on a deuteron target  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical analysis of that experiment  @xcite was also aggravated by a heavy averaging over the experimental conditions . at an even higher @xmath5-value of @xmath5= 0.67 @xmath6 the same process",
    "was again used under the same assumption of replacing @xmath8 by a polarized neutron to extract a value of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "corrections coming from a full @xmath3he wave function and rescattering processes have not yet been estimated .",
    "in such a situation it is of interest to theoretically investigate electron induced @xmath3he observables with respect to their sensitivity to @xmath2 .",
    "the ideas @xcite for choosing certain observables are based on plane wave impulse approximation and the fact that the polarization of @xmath3he is carried with about 90 % by the polarized neutron .",
    "thus it is well known ( see for instance  @xcite ) that under neglection of fsi and keeping only the principal s - state an asymmetry based on scattering of a polarized electron on a @xmath3he target polarized perpendicular to the ( virtual ) photon direction is proportional to @xmath9 . in  @xcite inclusive scattering",
    "has been investigated under the assumption of pwia but keeping a full @xmath3he wave function with the pessimistic result , that the proton contribution overwhelms the signature of @xmath2 .",
    "the question remains what happens under the full dynamics .",
    "based on the same simple picture one can form a ratio of two asymmetries , one with the @xmath3he spin perpendicular and one parallel to the photon direction . that ratio will be proportional to @xmath10 . in order to focus more on the neutron one uses the @xmath1 reaction and measures the knocked out neutron in coincidence with the scattered electron . again the important question arises : will sensitivity to @xmath2 remain when the full dynamics is taken into account ?",
    "we investigate these questions using full fledged faddeev calculations and modern nuclear forces and including mec s as well .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a strictly nonrelativistic treatment even if we go into higher @xmath5-ranges , where relativity should and will play a role .",
    "at least we can get insight into the importance or decrease of importance of fsi .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the theoretical framework .",
    "our results for inclusive scattering and for the semi - exclusive processes are shown in sec .",
    "we summarize in sec .",
    "iv and end with an outlook .",
    "the cross section for the process @xmath0 is given as  @xcite    @xmath11    where @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the energy and direction of the scattered electron , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are kinematical factors , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 response functions and @xmath22 the helicity of the initial electron . the asymmetry is defined as    @xmath23    where the dependence on @xmath24 and @xmath25 has been shown explicitly .",
    "these angles denote the direction of the @xmath3he spin in relation to the direction of the photon .",
    "( in contrast to @xcite we modified slightly the definition of the @xmath26 responses . ) in @xcite it is shown that in pwia and under the assumption of keeping only the principal @xmath27-state of the @xmath3he wave function that asymmetry is given as    @xmath28 } { ( f_1^{(n ) } ) ^2   + 2 ( f_1^{(p ) } ) ^2   - \\frac{q^2}{4 m_n^2 } \\left [ ( g_m^{(n ) } ) ^2 + 2 ( g_m^{(p ) } ) ^2 + { \\alpha } \\frac{6 m_n^2}{{\\vert \\vec q \\vert}^2 } \\left ( ( f_1^{(n ) } ) ^2 + 2 ( f_1^{(p ) } ) ^2 \\right ) \\right ] ( 1 + 2 \\tan^{2 } { \\theta \\over 2 } ) } .",

    "( please note a misprint in eq .",
    "( 78 ) of @xcite : the square bracket in the denominator should end not before but behind @xmath32 ) .",
    "our notation for the photon momentum is @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "regarding eq .",
    "( [ eq77 ] ) we see that @xmath35= 0 @xmath36 ( 90 @xmath36 ) emphasizes @xmath37 ( @xmath9 ) . in the present investigation",
    "we shall study the dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath2 including fsi and mec s .",
    "we shall also provide insight into the contributions arising from photon absorption on the protons .",
    "this extends first studies carried through in @xcite , where only fsi effects were investigated .",
    "the second process we are going to study is @xmath1 .",
    "the sixfold differential cross section is given as  @xcite    @xmath39 @xmath40 where in addition to what has been said before @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 denote the neutron direction , its momentum , its ( nonrelativistic ) kinetic energy , the magnitude of the relative momentum of the two undetected protons and its direction .",
    "@xmath47 for two undetected protons .",
    "note that @xmath46= 1 for the @xmath48 reaction .",
    "now the asymmetry defined in the same manner in relation to the electron helicities is given as @xmath49    we form the ratio @xmath50 , where @xmath51 refers to @xmath52= 90 @xmath36 ( 0 @xmath36 ) and study its sensitivity to changes in @xmath2 and fsi as well as mec influences .",
    "it will also be of interest to see the proton contribution to that ratio , which is mostly caused by rescattering .    the technical performance in momentum space and the necessarily involved partial wave decomposition has been described in  @xcite and references therein .",
    "we first regard the process @xmath0 . throughout",
    "we use the high precision nn force av18  @xcite together with @xmath53- and @xmath54-like mec s  @xcite according to the riska prescription  @xcite . as a reference model",
    "we take the hhler parametrisation for all electromagnetic form factors of the nucleons  @xcite .",
    "there are more recent parametrizations , which are based on newer data , fulfill constraints of pqcd etc .",
    "@xcite , which , however , would not change the conclusions of our study . besides the neglection of relativistic corrections the insufficient knowledge of the mec s appears to be a second concern about theoretical uncertainties .",
    "while the nn force chosen has been at least adjusted to the rich set of nn data the choice of mec s is not constrained in a corresponding manner .",
    "the ones we are using are however at least in harmony with the continuity equation . in view of this situation we would like to show results without and with inclusion of mec s . thus one can see the magnitudes of the shifts caused by the mec s alone .",
    "the calculations including fsi and mec s will be denoted by `` full '' in the following .",
    "what we call pwias does not include fsi nor mec s but allows photon absorption on all three nucleons .",
    "this can also be expressed as photon absorption , say on nucleon  1 , but then keeping fully antisymmetrized plane waves in the final state .",
    "we show in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] the four response functions @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 as a function of the energy transfer @xmath59 .",
    "the first ( second ) case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) corresponds roughly to @xmath5= 0.1 ( 0.2 ) @xmath6 .",
    "more precisely in the two cases we have chosen the initial electron energy to be 778 ( 1728 ) mev and the electron scattering angle as 23.7 ( 15.0 ) @xmath36 .",
    "there are always four curves : one is the reference curve with the @xmath2 as given in  @xcite and `` full '' dynamics and another one with fsi but without mec s .",
    "the two other curves are of `` full '' type but @xmath2 is multiplied by 1.6 and 0.4 , respectively .",
    "@xmath55 is not affected by mec s since we do not include two - body densities .",
    "its dependence on @xmath2 is marginal , since @xmath55 is dominated by the proton .",
    "besides into the density operator @xmath2 also enters into the mec s , but there only as a difference to the proton form factor .",
    "consequently changes of @xmath2 hardly affect @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "still the both response functions are visibly changed by mec s .",
    "@xmath58 is the only response function of interest in searching for @xmath2 sensitivities .",
    "unfortunately we see quite a strong effect of mec s which introduces a theoretical uncertainty as mentioned in the introduction . for the mec s",
    "chosen the @xmath60 60  % changes in @xmath2 lead to about @xmath60 8  % changes in @xmath58 in its quasi - elastic peak region around @xmath61 = 50 mev .",
    "this is for @xmath5= 0.1 @xmath6 .    for @xmath5= 0.2 @xmath6",
    "those changes are larger .",
    "they amount to @xmath62 13 % in the quasi - elastic peak region around @xmath59= 100 mev .",
    "this is highly insufficient to serve as a signature for @xmath2 . on top",
    "there are uncertainties coming from mec s .",
    "the reason for these small changes lies in the strong proton contribution as already shown in  @xcite , based , however , on a pwia calculation .",
    "this is now confirmed using the full dynamics .",
    "we performed one calculation for each @xmath5 in the peak region dropping all proton electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the results are shown in table i. we see that @xmath55 is totally dominated by photon absorption on the proton .",
    "the reductions for @xmath56 by switching off the proton contribution are about 87 % , while they are much less for @xmath57 , namely about 27 % . now in case of @xmath58 one has reductions of 87 % and 80 % at @xmath5= 0.1 and 0.2 @xmath6 , which explains the insufficient sensitivity against changes in @xmath2 at these @xmath5-values .",
    "we refrained from investigating higher @xmath5-values because missing relativistic effects might change the results .",
    "there is no need to compare with pwias calculations , since they are known  @xcite to be insufficient .    since for those changes of @xmath2",
    "the shifts in @xmath55 and @xmath56 are negligible the changes in the asymmetry @xmath63 reflect directly the changes in @xmath58 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , which for the sake of completeness also includes @xmath64 .",
    "we see first of all the strong shifts caused by the mec s .",
    "then around @xmath59= 50 ( 100 ) mev for @xmath5= 0.1 ( 0.2 ) @xmath6 small modifications of @xmath63 of about @xmath65 8 ( 13 ) % are seen caused by the @xmath65 60 % variations in @xmath2 .",
    "the strong proton contribution explains the insufficient sensitivity against @xmath2 .",
    "the measurements of both asymmetries are nevertheless of great importance .",
    "@xmath64 has been used recently  @xcite to extract @xmath4 as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "pioneering measurements on the asymmetry @xmath63 have been performed in  @xcite .",
    "they have been analyzed in  @xcite , however without mec s and using @xmath30 instead of @xmath2 in the single nucleon density operator .",
    "the agreement with those data was quite good .",
    "more recently the asymmetry given in eq .",
    "( 2 ) was measured around @xmath24 = 130 to 140@xmath36  @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the data with calculations of the `` full '' type .",
    "the agreement was quite good at @xmath5= 0.1 @xmath6 but an overshooting of the theory was observed for @xmath5= 0.2 @xmath6 .",
    "it has to be remarked that in those calculations still @xmath30 has been used in the single nucleon density operator . despite the fact that a strong proton contribution is present the changes by going from @xmath30 to @xmath2 are noticeable .",
    "we document that in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] by comparing the data at @xmath5= 0.1 and 0.2 @xmath6  @xcite with two `` full '' calculations using @xmath30 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "using @xmath2 leads to a slight deterioration in comparison to the @xmath30 result .    let us now move on to the process @xmath1 and check whether it is more sensitive to @xmath2 . as emphasized before our present strictly nonrelativistic framework",
    "does not allow reliable predictions at high @xmath5-values , say above @xmath5= 0.2 @xmath6 .",
    "nevertheless we shall now exhibit results beyond that with the only aim to describe possible trends for the significance of fsi and mec s .",
    "we can not exclude that these results might change in the future to an unknown extend , when relativity will be correctly included .",
    "with respect to extracting neutron information it appears optimal to choose a break up configuration where the neutron is knocked out in the direction of the photon . on top",
    "one can assume that the neutron receives the full photon momentum and moreover the photon energy equals the final neutron energy .",
    "this is often called quasi - free scattering condition .",
    "we choose ten different @xmath5-values as shown in table  ii .",
    "the related photon energy @xmath59 , its three momentum @xmath66 and the c.m .",
    "energy of the final three nucleons @xmath67 ( all evaluated nonrelativistically ) are also given .",
    "for the sake of orientation corresponding relativistic values are included as well .",
    "the comparison of these parameters shows already that at the high @xmath5-values relativity can not be neglected .    in the following figures , figs .",
    "[ fig5]-[fig7 ] , we compare first of all results for pwias , `` full '' and calculations with fsi but without mecs . on top we add the result for the scattering on a free neutron at rest .",
    "this is treated fully relativistically and will be referred to in the figures as the pure neutron result .",
    "though we concentrate in this paper on kinematical regions which are optimal to extract neutron information we would also like to use the occasion to point to other regions in phase space where one can study the reaction mechanism and thus nuclear dynamics .",
    "therefore we not only show the high energy region of the knocked out neutron but the observables for all neutron energies , where for the lower ones the proton contribution in the photon absorption is very substantial .",
    "this is clearly exhibited by displaying also predictions where all electromagnetic proton form factors are put to zero and thus the photon is absorbed only on the neutron .    finally in pwias , which is based on a single nucleon current",
    "we show also results where the nonrelativistic single nucleon current is replaced by the fully relativistic one . this idea has been put forward before by jeschonnek and donnelly  @xcite . our way to represent that relativistic current which is ideal for a straightforward extension of the partial wave representation we use up to",
    "now is given in the appendix a.    we show the observables @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and @xmath69 in fig .",
    "furthermore as guidance for experiments we also provide the sixfold differential cross section in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "lets start with @xmath70 .",
    "roughly spoken the picture is the same for all @xmath5-values with the exception of the lowest one .",
    "the `` full '' result rises quickly from the highest neutron energy @xmath43 and then with some small oscillations remains essentially flat towards smaller energies . at the higher end of the neutron energy",
    "it is close to the pure neutron value for @xmath5 = 0.2 @xmath6 and higher momentum transfers .",
    "the effect of mec is most pronounced at the first bump after the sharp rise .",
    "pwias is drastically different in the region of higher neutron energies , except at the very end , where all curves coincide .",
    "thus fsi should be taken into account if , because of experimental reasons , some averaging over neutron energies is needed .",
    "the fully relativistic single nucleon current inserted into a pwias calculation has only a minor effect at the high neutron energies but it changes the results at the lower ones above @xmath5= 0.3 @xmath6 quite significantly .",
    "for some @xmath5-values we dropped artificially the proton contribution by switching off all electromagnetic proton form factors .",
    "this leads to a drastic change in pwias and the `` full '' calculation at all energies ( except the very highest ones ) .",
    "the two smallest @xmath5-values are special , especially @xmath5= 0.05 @xmath6 , where the `` full '' calculation is far away from the pure neutron result .    in this paper",
    "we are mainly concerned with the @xmath2 effects in @xmath63 .",
    "again we find that the rough overall behavior of the `` full '' result is similar for all @xmath5-values , except for the two lowest ones . at the high @xmath5-values oscillations",
    "develop as a function of the neutron energy and the effect of mec s diminishes . in any case",
    "mec effects are mild and disappear in the high energy region .",
    "but fsi remains important for all @xmath5-values as is obvious by comparing to the pwias results .",
    "while the latter ones reach the pure neutron value at the high energy end the `` full '' curves stay always below that value .",
    "the effect of the relativistic single nucleon current is again strongly noticeable at @xmath5= 0.3 @xmath6 and higher momentum transfers .",
    "the proton contribution is quite significant as shown in some examples . at the two small @xmath5-values calculations without fsi",
    "would obviously be totally meaningless .",
    "[ fig7 ] displays the six - fold differential cross section against the neutron energy for a few examples of @xmath5-values .",
    "we see a steep rise at the high neutron energies due to the @xmath71 @xmath72-matrix pole in the pp - subsystem near zero subsystem energy .",
    "since we did not include the coulomb force the cross section values at the very end might change if that approximation can be avoided in the future .",
    "the cross section drops quickly by orders of magnitudes going to smaller @xmath43-values . at the very low energies there is again a rise which is due to photon absorption on the protons , as also shown in the figures . at the very high energy end the proton contribution is dying out .",
    "it is also clear that in all cases pwias is highly insufficient .",
    "now we focus on the central issue , namely the sensitivity of @xmath73 and of @xmath74 with respect to changes in @xmath2 .",
    "since the cross section drops rapidly with decreasing neutron energy and since only at high energies results of the 3n calculations can be used to extract neutron information , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] only a high neutron energy range .",
    "we show results for choosing @xmath2 according to the fixed hhler parametrisation and to the values 1.25 @xmath2 and 0.75 @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath75 is not affected we display only @xmath74 in fig .",
    "there are six curves , three for pwias and three for the full calculations .",
    "as already noticed in the results for @xmath63 we also see that fsi can never be neglected . if one regards for instance the range of about 20 mev below the highest neutron energy then for @xmath5= 0.35 @xmath6 and higher the full dynamics shifts the pwias results between 10 and 42 % .",
    "this is comparable to the signature we are after , namely the changes of the full result by modifying @xmath2 by @xmath62 25  % . at the highest neutron energy",
    "these changes start at @xmath62 32 % for @xmath5= 0.25 @xmath6 and decrease slightly to @xmath62 27 % at @xmath5= 0.50 @xmath6 .",
    "thus there are even enhancements in the changes of the ratio @xmath74 against the ones in the variation of @xmath2 . at the lower @xmath5-values pwias results",
    "would be totally meaningless . at @xmath5= 0.20 @xmath6 those changes in the ratio increase to @xmath60 42 % and at @xmath5= 0.15 @xmath6 even to @xmath62 204 % .",
    "this drastic increase is of course caused by the smallness of that specific ratio . at the two smallest @xmath5-values the sensitivity drops rapidly , @xmath65 17 % at @xmath5= 0.1 @xmath6 and @xmath62 2 % at @xmath5= 0.05 @xmath6 .",
    "the reason is the strong contribution of the proton as seen in fig .",
    "clearly in all cases the pure neutron value is far off .",
    "one can use the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] to estimate roughly the error in the @xmath2 extraction using only pwias .",
    "regarding for instance the cases @xmath5= 0.3 or 0.35 @xmath6 and assuming that the experimental value for @xmath74 measured near the high energy end would lie on the pwias curve ( with @xmath2 multiplied by the factor 1 ) then for the `` full '' calculation to agree with the experimental value one would have to increase the @xmath2-value by 25 % and more",
    ". referred to the pure neutron value this change would be even bigger .",
    "of course this estimate is very rough since the experimental conditions leading to averaging have to be taken into account and the magnitude of relativistic effects are basically unknown but it clearly shows the need of `` full '' calculations for any analysis of such experiments .",
    "we performed faddeev calculations for the processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 based on the nn force av18 and consistent mec s .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath63 in the inclusive process turned out to be not sensitive enough to @xmath2 to allow its extraction .",
    "this is due to the strong proton contribution .",
    "our studies were performed at @xmath5= 0.1 and 0.2 @xmath6 , which , however , show a tendency for a decrease of the proton contribution with increasing four momentum transfer .",
    "thus we can not rule out that at higher @xmath5-values @xmath63 might be useful to extract @xmath2 .",
    "our nonrelativistic approach does not allow to enter into that realm reliably .",
    "the situation is however favorable in the neutron knock out process @xmath1 to extract @xmath2 information by measuring @xmath74 .",
    "in contrast to possible expectations fsi corrections are mandatory as documented for several @xmath5-values up to the highest one which we studied , @xmath5= 0.5 @xmath6 . though we entered in the relativistic domain with purely nonrelativistic calculations it appears likely that the fsi effects found are fairly realistic . therefore relying on 3n continuum calculations ,",
    "whose quality has been tested beforehand in pure 3n scattering processes  @xcite , one can extract from such measurements @xmath2 information .",
    "there are , however , still theoretical uncertainties related to mec s and of course relativistic effects .    as a first step into relativity we used the fully relativistic single nucleon current operator in a pwias calculation and found indeed quite significant changes , but fortunately not in the high energy end of the neutron spectrum , which is favorable for the @xmath2 extraction .",
    "improvements in the theoretical framework in the near future are planned .",
    "3n forces will be included , like it is standard by now in pure 3n scattering ( see for instance  @xcite ) and further types of mec s .",
    "of special interest thereby will be to guarantee consistency to the nuclear forces .",
    "besides working with standard potential models the application of effective field theory concepts in the form of chiral perturbation theory appears to be very promising in the low momentum region .",
    "this has already started in two- , three- and four - nucleon systems including the coupling to the photon field .",
    "for a recent overview and references see  @xcite .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( j.g . ) and by the polish committee for scientific research .",
    "one of us ( w.g . ) would like to thank the foundation for polish science for the financial support during his stay in cracow .",
    "the numerical calculations have been performed on the cray t90 of the nic in jlich , germany .",
