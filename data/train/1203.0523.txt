    "general relativity ( gr ) can account , in the context of the cosmological standard model , for all cosmological observations provided two unknown constituents , dark energy ( @xmath0 ) and dark matter ( @xmath1 ) are considered in the stress - energy tensor of einstein field equations .",
    "given that the nature of dark energy and dark matter is unknown it is quite natural that alternative theories of gravity are considered alongside with proposals for dark energy and dark matter ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this respect ,",
    "a particularly interesting alternative to gr is the broad class of theories arising from replacing the linear dependence of scalar curvature in the action of gr by a more general function , the so - called @xmath2 theories @xcite . in the context of this extension",
    "one might also question the assumption that gravity is coupled nominimally with matter @xcite .",
    "a nonminimally coupling between matter and curvature gives rise to a deviation of the geodesic motion of test particles , nonconservation of the stress - energy tensor and many other striking features .",
    "these also include the breaking of the degeneracy of the lagrangian densities which , in gr , give rise to the stress - energy tensor of the perfect fluid @xcite , deviation from the hydrodynamic equilibrium of stars @xcite , mimicking of dark matter in galaxies @xcite and clusters of galaxies @xcite , of dark energy at cosmological scales @xcite and somewhat more natural conditions for preheating in inflationary models @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that the nonminimal coupling between matter and curvature can be interpreted , under conditions , as an effective pressure leading to a generalization of the newtonian gravitational potential in the weak field limit @xcite , and to mimic a cosmological constant for a suitable matter distribution @xcite .    in this work",
    "we examine the role played by the nonminimal coupling in wormhole geometries , namely traversable wormholes , and on the possibility of generating closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) .",
    "wormholes in classical gr are rather exotic objects . in order to ensure that gravity is attractive the raychaudhuri s equation for the expansion of a congruence of geodesics defined by a tangent vector field @xmath3 states that @xmath4 , which , using einstein s equations , implies that @xmath5 .",
    "this last condition is usually referred to as strong energy condition and it directly implies the null energy condition ( nec ) , which states that @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a null vector .",
    "the nec , if applied for instance to a perfect fluid , implies that @xmath8 .",
    "however , in order to have wormhole solutions it is required the violation of the nec in a region containing the wormhole throat @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there are two other conditions that are verified by the stress - energy tensor of all known types of matter : the dominant energy condition ( dec ) which implies for a perfect fluid that @xmath9 and @xmath10 $ ] , meaning that the sound velocity can not exceed the speed of light , and the weak energy condition which states that @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "the dec implies the weak energy condition and this implies the nec .",
    "thus , if the nec is violated the three other energy conditions are also violated . in gr",
    ", this implies that exotic and unknown forms of matter are needed to obtain wormhole solutions so that observers perceive negative energy densities .",
    "one of the most striking features of stable wormhole solutions is that one can generate ctcs from them @xcite .",
    "this can give origin to controversy and one can wonder whether traversable wormholes can be realistically created @xcite . given the above requirements on the energy density and pressure , several effects of quantum nature have been invoked . for instance , it has been argued that these exotic behaviors might arise , due to the casimir effect , gravitational backreaction and other effects .",
    "however , given that these effects most often lead to instabilities that prevent wormhole and ctcs , they actually turn impossible any form of time travel ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "as we shall see , ctcs out of wormhole solutions can be obtained , under conditions , in the context of nonminimal curvature - matter coupled theories even for ordinary matter .",
    "the present work extends the results of refs @xcite , where exact wormhole solutions were obtained for a trivial redshift function , the function that defines the @xmath12 component of the metric .",
    "as will be seen , theories of gravity with nonminimal matter - curvature coupling admit solutions that violate the nec even for ordinary matter for the most general type of wormholes , and these can give origin to ctcs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii presents a brief outline of the nonminimal curvature - matter coupling in @xmath2 theories of gravity . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce the wormhole geometry supported by this type of modified theories of gravity .",
    "we consider the field equations for a perfect fluid . in sec .",
    "iv , we look for traversable wormhole solutions in some specific limits .",
    "we analyze the violation of the nec and we relate it with the possibility of time travel . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss our results and present our conclusions .",
    "the action for a nonminimal curvature - matter coupling in @xmath2 theories is given by @xcite    @xmath13\\sqrt{-g}d^{4}x,\\label{eq : nonminimal coupling action}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 are arbitrary functions of the scalar curvature , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the matter lagrangian density .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath18 characterizes the strength of the interaction between curvature and matter and has suitable units .",
    "notice that theories with similar features have also been examined in the context of late time - accelerating universes @xcite .    varying the action with respect to the metric we obtain the field equations and adapting that @xmath19 :    @xmath20    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the usual stress - energy tensor of matter defined as @xmath25    equation ( [ eq : field equations ] ) can be rewritten in a more conventional form in terms of the einstein s tensor    @xmath26    where the effective stress - energy tensor has been defined as @xmath27     @xmath28.\\label{eq : definition of effective tensor}\\ ] ]    applying the bianchi identity , @xmath29 , in equation ( [ eq : field equations ] ) and using the relation @xmath30 we obtain for the stress - energy tensor of matter @xmath31\\nabla^{\\mu}r,\\label{eq : derivative of the stress energy tensor}\\ ] ] meaning that its covariant derivative does not vanish automatically .",
    "( [ eq : derivative of the stress energy tensor ] ) implies that the motion of a test particle is nongeodesic as an extra force shows up @xcite @xmath32    for the specific case of a perfect fluid with stress - energy tensor given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the energy density , @xmath35 is the pressure and @xmath36 the 4-velocity , the extra force is given by @xcite @xmath37h^{\\mu\\nu},\\label{eq : extra - force}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the projection operator .",
    "we consider the wormhole metric written as follows @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are arbitrary functions , usually referred to as redshift and shape functions , respectively . the radial coordinate has specific properties .",
    "contrary to the proper length , @xmath42 , which is monotonic and that vanishes at the wormhole throat , the radial coordinate is defined only in the interval @xmath43 $ ] where it is nonmonotonic with a minimum at the wormhole throat , @xmath44 . at this point",
    "we have a coordinate singularity : @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 must satisfy some additional constrains @xcite : @xmath46 the so - called flaring out condition implies that at or close to the throat , @xmath47 .",
    "this is the constraint that induces the violation of the nec ; @xmath48 moreover , in order to have a proper length function that is finite and well behaved , the condition @xmath49 must be satisfied everywhere ; @xmath50 finally , functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 should also verify the condition @xmath51 as @xmath52 , which follows from the finiteness of the energy density @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    these conditions , for functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 , ensure sensible wormhole solutions .",
    "but if the goal is to obtain a traversable wormhole , the existence of horizons must be prevented .",
    "hence , the redshift function @xmath40 must remain finite everywhere and should vanish as we approach asymptotic flat regions . additionally , there are a few quantitative conditions that must be verified concerning the duration of the hypothetical journey through the wormhole and about the forces felt by the hypothetical traveler .",
    "these constraints are discussed in great detail in ref .",
    ".      a wormhole must violate the nec , and in gr this translates into the condition @xmath55 in the vicinity of the wormhole throat .",
    "in a theory with nonminimal curvature - matter coupling , the energy conditions were studied in ref . @xcite and the condition to have wormhole solutions translates into @xmath56 as follow from eq .",
    "( [ eq : einstein equation modified ] ) .",
    "this is a fundamental feature of our analysis since it allows , in principle , for some values of the nonminimal coupling parameter @xmath18 , to violate the nec while satisfying for the stress - energy tensor of matter the condition : @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , wormhole solutions can be obtained even if matter satisfies the dec .",
    "once a wormhole solution has been obtained it can be shown that one can convert it into a time machine .",
    "for instance , following ref .",
    "@xcite one way of doing such conversion consists in accelerating one of the wormhole mouths close to the speed of light and then revert its motion to its original location .",
    "this acceleration can be achieved by gravitational or electromagnetic means .",
    "the metric that describes this procedure , within the accelerated wormhole and outside but near its mouths , is given by @xmath58 where @xmath42 is the proper length , @xmath59 is the same redshift function , @xmath60 is a form factor that localizes the acceleration in one of the wormhole mouths and @xmath61 is the acceleration of that mouth as measured by its own asymptotic frame .",
    "some other alternative ways of producing time machines are also described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in summary ,",
    "the construction of a time machine requires three indispensable steps : a stable traversable wormhole , a time shift between the two mouths , and a pull to bring them close together adiabatically .",
    "the procedure of inducing a time - shift implies some additional conditions on the type of acceleration applied to the wormhole mouth in order to keep it traversable and stable .",
    "but the subtle point here is that there is no additional constraints on the geometry .",
    "this means that a stable traversable wormhole yields ctcs .",
    "as we shall see , in theories with a nonminimal coupling between matter and curvature , stable configurations that allow for time travel can be obtained even for ordinary matter , that is , matter that satisfy the dec .",
    "the field eq . ( [ eq : einstein equation modified ] ) are very complex , and following ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the simplest case of @xmath62 and introduce to start with the stress - energy tensor of an anisotropic distribution of matter given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the 4-velocity , @xmath65 is the unit spacelike vector in the radial direction , i.e. , @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the energy density , @xmath68 is the radial pressure measured in the direction of @xmath65 and @xmath69 is the tangential pressure measured in the orthogonal direction to @xmath65 .",
