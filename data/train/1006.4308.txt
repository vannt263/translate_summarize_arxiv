    "the characteristics and the behaviour of physical systems can be understood and predicted by the investigation of the underlying free energy landscape .",
    "the knowledge of this often complex surface allows one to determine reaction pathways for chemical reactions as well as stable configurations for proteins @xcite and glass - forming systems @xcite .",
    "a successful tool for these studies are computer simulations which help to explore the characteristics of the system in detail .",
    "naturally , during the last years a lot of effort has been spent to develop novel efficient and time - saving methods .",
    "+ specifically in protein sciences , the free energy approach is promising for the investigation of unknown folding mechanisms . to achieve a proper description of the dynamical behaviour",
    ", the trajectories may be projected onto a set of well chosen collective variables @xcite which allow to define an effective energy landscape .",
    "these variables can be interpreted as effective reaction coordinates spanning the phase space respectively the free energy space of the system . well known collective variables are the number of native contacts , dihedral angles and the essential eigenvectors or principal components of the protein @xcite .",
    "thus a set of well suited reaction coordinates offers the opportunity to describe the folding or unfolding of a protein adequately without too much loss of information .",
    "+ however , it has to be mentioned that in some cases suitable collective variables are hard to determine .",
    "the investigation of the underlying dynamics of the system can then be performed by computational methods like discrete path sampling @xcite and transition path sampling @xcite to overcome this problem .",
    "these techniques represent computational algorithms which are not dependent on the usage of collective variables .",
    "+ experiments and computer simulations have shown that naturally occuring proteins often have free energy landscapes with global funneling properties @xcite .",
    "nevertheless local minima can occur which represent trapped conformations of the protein @xcite .",
    "the transitions between these minima which are called rare events occur on timescales which are typically not accessible in computer simulations . over the last years",
    "several numerical methods have been developed to accelarate rare events and to compute the underlying free energy landscapes . in the following",
    "we will mention the most common ones which have been well established in the scientific community .",
    "+ often used methods are thermodynamic integration @xcite and free energy perturbation @xcite .",
    "these techniques are well suited to calculate static properties like hydration energies but normally fail in the calculation of free energy differences between specific folding mechanisms .",
    "to overcome this situation and to gain insight into dynamical quantities , more sophisticated ideas have to be adopted .",
    "+ the umbrella sampling method @xcite allows to determine free energy differences via the corresponding probability distributions of the whole accessible phase space .",
    "an effective additional biasing potential drives the system to more unlikely regions such that the whole phase space is visited .",
    "this idea has also been used in adaptive force biased calculations @xcite , steered as well as adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations @xcite and multicanonical sampling approaches @xcite .",
    "another promising method for the investigation of folding properties is the replica - exchange algorithm @xcite .",
    "+ specifically in the last years several techniques have been proposed which employ an adaptively varying bias potential as an estimate for the free energy .",
    "examples for these methods are the metadynamics algorithm in its several variants @xcite and the related local elevation method respectively the conformational flooding approach @xcite . + the main idea of the metadynamics method relies on a successive flattening of the free energy landscape by an additional potential energy in form of small gaussian hills which are positioned at relaxed times at the present location of the system",
    ". then the free energy can be estimated as a negative mirror of the potential energy which is exact in the limit of long simulation times @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that this method is in principle valid for all collective variables and offers a broad range of applicability @xcite .",
    "even the calculation of microscopic averages within the metadynamics scheme has been successfully examined @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the drastic error dependence on the parameters of the algorithm @xcite in the original metadynamics scheme has to be mentioned . keeping the errors within tolerable ranges results in a drastic increase of simulation time . to avoid local bumps in the landscape and to keep the errors low , extensions of the existing metadynamics method @xcite",
    "have been proposed which offer a more reliable derivation .",
    "+ in this paper we present a histogram reweighted metadynamics technique which offers the opportunity to overcome some drawbacks of the original method and its variants .",
    "our method is grid - based which means that the energy landscape spanned by the collective variables is divided into several regions . by adding a short range cut - off biasing potential which is only evaluated at the grid points of a predefined grid , the corresponding simulation time can be massively decreased",
    ". finally , the corresponding biased probability distributions are reweighted by histogram techniques @xcite to compute the free energy landscape a posteriori .",
    "it has been noticed that these techniques offer a low error dependent description @xcite .",
    "+ additionally a projection scheme is introduced which allows the investigation of further collective variables if the probability distributions of the studied variables are well overlapping and if the projected coordinates are well - suited and fastly varying .",
    "although it is clearly impossible to reconstruct the whole highly dimensional phase space of the protein , our projection scheme allows to investigate additional low dimensional reaction coordinates like dihedral angles or spatial distributions in good agreement to directly derived energy landscapes . as a consequence of this scheme , no further simulation time",
    "is required as the analysis can be performed a posteriori and the landscape is not restricted to the actual chosen set of coordinates . +",
    "this becomes useful by regarding the fact that difficulties for predefined collective variables may arise , if they are not the true reaction coordinates of the system @xcite or give unsuitable descriptions of the corresponding free energy landscapes .",
    "this is in particular a problem if the underlying folding or unfolding mechanisms are too complex for being projected onto a low dimensional subspace which may lead to wrong conclusions @xcite or if the phase space can not be sampled efficiently . in these cases , discrete path sampling @xcite , transition path sampling @xcite and additional methods",
    "@xcite allow to investigate the hidden complexity of the free energy landscape without the usage of collective variables as alternative approaches .",
    "+ by comparison to other approaches , it has to be noticed that in recent publications @xcite the usage of umbrella sampled biased probability distributions respectively using histogram reweighting procedures @xcite for the correction of free energy landscapes has also been claimed .",
    "even the evaluation of the underlying potential on a grid point has been recently proposed for metadynamics @xcite as well as for a closely related adaptive bias molecular dynamics scheme @xcite .",
    "both ingredients have also been applied in a grid - based adaptive umbrella sampling scheme @xcite over a decade ago and the above mentioned techniques are implemented in common software packages @xcite . + a main reason for the introduction of grid evaluations is a massive decrease in computation time which scales by a constant factor .",
    "this fact is also used in @xcite where smoothly truncated gaussians are evaluated by a kd - tree .",
    "further realizations of grid techniques incorporate adaptive grids where the potential energy is calculated by a polynomial extrapolation on the grid points @xcite , choosing the potential of a close grid point as the biasing potential on the particle @xcite or applying cut - off radii for the gaussians @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the above mentioned adaptive biased grid approach in its computational cost scales linearly with simulation time in contrast to ordinary metadynamics @xcite . here",
    "cubic b - splines are used for the evaluation of the biasing potential on the corresponding grid points .",
    "+ our approach has the advantage of a well - defined simple potential all over the energy surface .",
    "this allows to change the resolution of the grid on - the - fly even after the simulations have finished to resolve regions of specific interest in more detail .",
    "in addition , it is easy to implement and scales with a constant number @xmath0 of calculations per timestep , where @xmath1 is the number of collective variables , respectively the dimension of the grid .",
    "+ as a further remark , our potential energy landscape is purely used as a biasing potential to accelerate rare events .",
    "hence , the fine resolution of the free energy landscape is achieved by histogram techniques .",
    "this allows us to use a very rough potential energy surface created in a short simulation time .",
    "additionally the bias force is always well - defined such that discontinouities are avoided . +",
    "therefore our method in its interpretation is closely related to the wang - landau approach @xcite and adaptive umbrella biasing techniques @xcite with the effectiveness of @xcite .",
    "this finally results in a simple and robust algorithm which is easy to implement in common public software packages like gromacs @xcite or other programs and allows to tune the resolution of the landscape on demand easily after the simulations have finished .",
    "+ we further derived an empirical formula for the computational cost required for the ordinary metadynamics scheme in comparison to our approach .",
    "thus we were able to show that the grid technique for reasons of computational efficiency is often more preferable especially for a large number of hills in comparison to the number of atoms in the system .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we introduce the method and the theoretical background .",
    "the third and the fourth section illustrate model test cases and the numerical details of the following peptide simulations .",
    "the fifth section presents the results for the alanine dipeptide and the met - enkephalin . in the sixth section the values for the computational cost required for both methods",
    "are investigated and an empirical formula is derived .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary in the last section .",
    "the system we consider is described by a set of coordinates @xmath2 evolving under the action of dynamics following the trajectory @xmath3 and described by a canonical equilibrium distribution at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the set of coordinates @xmath2 may include atomic positions or angles as well as any other auxiliary collective variable representing the characteristics of the system .",
    "+ if the system shows metastability , some regions separated by large energy barriers can not be explored by the evolution of the trajectories in a reasonable simulation time .",
    "guided by the conventional metadynamics approach an additional potential has to be added at specific constant times @xmath5 on the trajectory @xmath3 to overcome the barriers and to accelerate the rare events .",
    "it has to be ensured that the protein relaxes between these times such that the system diffuses in the next local minimum . for the force evaluation in the ordinary metadynamics method",
    ", the sum over all previously added gaussian functions has to be performed @xcite which results in a strong increase of computation time . to avoid this increase",
    ", we use an approach where the additional potential energy is evaluated on the grid points of a predefined grid closely related to @xcite , spanning the whole range of the accessible phase space in the set of collective variables @xmath2 . + the grid points @xmath6 are separated by the grid constant @xmath7 , which is the distance between two neighboring grid points in one dimension .",

    "the magnitude of the potential energy is given by the height @xmath14 like in the conventional metadynamics scheme . as it has been discussed in @xcite",
    "the values for @xmath14 have to be low .",
    "+ the potential energy at the grid points then evolves in simulation time with @xmath15 emerging rapidly if the specific neighborhood of the grid point is often visited by the trajectory , _",

    ", it can be even used to achieve a finer resolution of the grid in combination with histogram reweighting techniques . as a further remark",

    "it has to be pointed out , that the error in the energy is strongly dependent on the resolution of the histogram leading to more or less pronounced approximations . for a detailed description of the method we refer the reader to refs .",
    "as it was mentioned in the introduction , the main part of a successful calculation relies on the choice of appropriate collective variables on which the free energy surface is spanned .",
    "well - suited collective variables are dihedral angles as well as the essential eigenvectors of the system @xcite .",
    "it has been recently demonstrated that the application of eigenvectors as collective variables results in adequate descriptions of the folding mechanisms and of the free energy landscape in ordinary metadynamics computations @xcite .",
    "thus we follow this approach due to the assumption that nearly all relevant motion is captured in the first eigenvectors of the system @xcite .",
    "this is remarkable by regarding the fact that drastic difficulties appear if wrong reaction coordinates are chosen which do not capture the main motion @xcite . but nevertheless , it has again to be remarked that the usage of eigenvectors is not a guarantee for correctness of the free energy landscape due to hidden complexities in higher dimensional collective variables @xcite . in the following we give a brief description of the method .",
    "+ the essential eigenvectors can be calculated by the superimposed coordinates @xmath44 of @xmath45 atoms of the system which build the covariance matrix @xmath46 via @xmath47 where @xmath48 and the time - averaged or reference value is denoted by the brackets @xmath49 .",

    "( [ eq : bias ] ) even activates the motion of the remaining subspace .",

    "therefore a projection scheme allows to construct the free energy landscapes of additional collective variables like lower eigenvectors or dihedral angles a posteriori .",
    "+ the main idea is that the applied bias potential energy drives the system through structural transitions which could be in principle also observed in additional collective variables .",
    "the occurrence of the variables @xmath3 have to be projected onto the new collective variable @xmath57 exposed at the same time .",
    "formally , this is given by @xmath58 together with the corresponding biasing potential energy @xmath59 after the final timestep @xmath60 , the constant potential energy at the new grid points @xmath61 can be evaluated by using the maximum last values of @xmath62 . choosing the maximum value for @xmath63 within certain small regions @xmath64 , where @xmath64 is the half distance between two grid points gives @xmath65 for the construction of the potential energy landscape in the new set of chosen reaction coordinates .",

    "it is evident that after 250 hills the calculational cost increases drastically in the ordinary metadynamics algorithm whereas for the grid technique the required time remains constant .",
    "thus the grid variant of the metadynamics algorithm accelerates the computation of free energy landscapes in contrast to ordinary metadynamics considerably .",
    "+ nevertheless it can be assumed that the total time needed for the evaluation of the biasing forces in one timestep is negligible compared to the number of interactions especially for systems with many degrees of freedom .",
    "thus for a system with a large number of interactions , the cost for the evaluation of the metadynamics forces may decrease in comparison to the total time .",
    "+ to investigate this situation and to derive an empirical formula , we studied the computational cost for the met - enkephalin and the alanine dipeptide .",
    "hence we compared the total time which is required for the computation of the conventional metadynamics forces without a grid @xmath149 to the total time of an unbiased run @xmath150 .     of met - enkephalin and alanine dipeptide in comparison to the time for unbiased simulations @xmath150 for a varying number of hills @xmath148 and number of relaxation steps @xmath151 .",

    "we assume that this time is mainly determined by the evaluation of @xmath21 ( eqn .",
    "( [ eq : weight ] ) ) where all other effects are negligible .",
    "thus for much larger systems this factor may become size - dependent .",
    "+ in summary the total time needed for the evaluation of the ordinary metadynamics forces in a simulation can be written as @xmath154 where @xmath155 denotes the time needed for the evaluation of a single hill .",
    "additionally it is further assumed that the simulation has finished after @xmath148 hills have been set which is given by the relation @xmath156 . + furthermore the total time for an unbiased simulation @xmath150 is nearly proportional to the number of atoms in the system @xmath157 @xcite and the number of simulation timesteps @xmath158 which yields @xmath159 with the average time @xmath160 needed for the calculation of a single unbiased force .",
    "this gives the ratio @xmath161 where @xmath162 can be empirically determined .",
    "it has to be mentioned that the ratio is strongly dependent on the algorithms which are used for the evaluation of the forces but not on the processor speed .",
    "+ we have used varying relaxation timesteps of @xmath163 , different numbers of hills @xmath164 and the number of atoms was @xmath165 for the met - enkephalin with water and @xmath166 for the alanine dipeptide plus water whereas @xmath167 varies between 100 and 100000 .",
    "+ the values for different ordinary metadynamics runs in comparison to unbiased runs for the met - enkephalin and the alanine dipeptide are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thirteen ] .",
    "it is evident that all values follow eqn .",
    "( [ eq : slope ] ) with a proportionality factor of @xmath168 .",
    "hence for a large number of present hills , the ordinary metadynamics method drastically increases computation time .",
    "thus as a general remark , the original method becomes computationally very expensive if the number of hills is larger than the number of atoms .",
    "this is often given for systems with implicit solvent models or complex and large energy landscapes .",
    "+ as we have shown before , the grid based technique obeys a linear @xmath144 behaviour , such that the ratio between the time needed for an ordinary metadynamics algorithm in comparison to the grid technique also grows in accordance to eqn .",
    "( [ eq : slope ] ) . especially for ordinary metadynamics simulations where the free energy landscape is not refined by histogram reweighting procedures the amount of settled hills often increases the number of atoms which strongly suggests the use of grid based techniques .",
    "this is mostly important for classical molecular dynamics simulations for which our method is more intended in contrast to ab - intio methods .",
    "the evaluation of the electronic motion is here the main factor @xcite dominating most of the computation time such that the evaluation of the metadynamics potential can be neglected .",
    "we have presented an efficient and simple method for the calculation of free energy landscapes .",
    "the technique is applicable for a broad range of different systems .",
    "the basic principles are the construction of a potential landscape on a predefined grid in an initial simulation run which is used as a biasing potential in the final simulations .",
    "the corresponding probability distributions of the biased simulations are reweighted by the wham procedure whose usage avoids specific drawbacks of the ordinary metadynamics algorithm like large error tolerances @xcite . +",
    "another advantage is the easy implementation due to its simple methodology in software packages like gromacs .",
    "in addition we have presented the application of a projection scheme which allows to transform the energy landscape of certain collective variables to further reaction coordinates without any additional simulation effort .",
    "the specific choice of biasing the first eigenvectors of the system achieves a good activation of the whole system .",
    "+ the history - dependent potential is short - ranged in contrast to the ordinary metadynamics scheme @xcite and serves as a pure biasing potential .",
    "the fine resolution of the free energy landscape is achieved by histogram reweighting techniques of the corresponding probability distributions .",
    "a further advantage of the method is the opportunity to tune the resolution of the landscape even after the simulations were finished .",
    "+ furthermore we have explicitly shown that a grid - based technique scales with @xmath169 in contrast to the conventional metadynamics scheme ( @xmath170 ) , where @xmath53 denotes the simulation time and @xmath1 the number of applied collective variables .",
    "hence , compared to the ordinary metadynamics algorithm a grid technique is more preferable due to a decreased simulation time",
    ". this has been shown by the computational cost for the alanine dipeptide and the met - enkephalin . via a linear relation",
    "we were able to show that the computational cost of the ordinary metadynamics method in comparison to the grid technique can be predicted by an empirical formula .",
    "thus the grid method is preferable for systems where the number of settled hills exceeds the number of all atoms in the system .",
    "as we have discussed , this fact is given for implicit solvation models as well as very large energy landscapes .",
    "+ in addition our method has been tested for the peptides alanine dipeptide and met - enkephalin .",
    "the results are in good agreement to the literature .",
    "we have further shown that the energy landscape of the met - enkephalin is funnel - like with many different conformations at several energetic minima .",
    "the similarity between these conformations can be illustrated by a characteristic ratio of the hydrophilic solvent accessible surface area in comparison to the total solvent accessible area which results in a characteristic minimum around @xmath171 .",
    "the flexibility of the met - enkephalin is illustrated by plotting the dihedral angles of each residue in a ramachandran plot .",
    "+ additionally we have shown that the method allows to identify the stable conformations of the alanine dipeptide with good accuracy of the free energy landscape . following @xcite , where it was recognized that the functionality of a biasing potential does not depend on its specific shape ,",
    "we have further validated our technique by the explicit calculation of two well - defined test cases such that it can be used as an additional variation of the existing metadynamics methods .",

    "<S> in addition , the calculated free energy landscape is not restricted to the actual choice of collective variables and can in principle be extended to auxiliary variables of interest without further numerical effort . </S>",
    "<S> the applicability is shown for several examples . </S>",
    "<S> we present numerical results for the alanine dipeptide and the met - enkephalin in explicit solution to illustrate our approach . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we derive an empirical formula that allows the prediction of the computational cost for the ordinary metadynamics variant in comparison to our approach which is validated by a dimensionless representation .    </S>",
