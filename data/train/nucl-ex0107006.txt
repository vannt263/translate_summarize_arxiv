    "global variables such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 are important for the characterization of high - energy nuclear collisions .",
    "they constrain theoretical models , help to discriminate among various mechanisms of entropy and particle production and allow to derive information about the initial conditions  @xcite . during the first run of rhic at @xmath0  gev",
    "charged particle multiplicity and transverse energy density distributions were measured using the phenix detector .",
    "the results are analyzed as a function of centrality , defined by the number of nucleons participating in the collision and compared to similar results obtained at the much lower energies of the cern sps and the bnl ags .",
    "a detailed description of the phenix detector can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the detector consists of an axial - field magnet with two central arms , the east and the west arms , each one subtending 90@xmath7 in azimuth ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 units of pseudo - rapidity ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "two spectrometers , the north and south spectrometers , at forward angles ( @xmath11 ) around the beam axis serve to identify and track muons .",
    "the present analysis relies primarily on four phenix subsystems : the zero degree calorimeters ( zdc ) and the beam - beam counters ( bbc ) , used to derive the trigger and the off - line event selection , two layers of pad chambers ( pc ) , called pc1 and pc3 in the east arm , used to determine the charged particle multiplicity and two sectors of the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) in the west arm used to measure the transverse energy .",
    "these detector subsystems are shown in fig.[fig : set - up ] .",
    "l10.3 cm    the zdc are two small transverse area hadron calorimeters that measure the neutron energy within @xmath12 . besides their role as triggering devices they contribute to the centrality measurement , because their energy signal is proportional to the number of spectator neutrons  @xcite .",
    "the bbc comprise of two arrays of 64 quartz - radiator cherenkov detectors , located at @xmath131.44 m from the center of the interaction region , covering 2@xmath14 in @xmath8 and @xmath15 .",
    "the bbc also provide the start timing and vertex position  @xcite .",
    "the pc provide three - dimensional coordinates along the charged - particle trajectories  @xcite .",
    "each pc layer has 8 wire chambers with cathode pad readout .",
    "pc1 and pc3 are placed at radial distances of 2.49  m and 4.98  m , respectively .",
    "the instrumented part of the emcal is a lead / scintillating tile calorimeter  @xcite which covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath16 with an azimuthal aperture of @xmath17 .",
    "the depth of the calorimeter corresponds to @xmath18 radiation lengths , equivalent to @xmath19 interaction lengths for hadrons .",
    "the event selection consists of an interaction trigger generated by a coincidence between the north and south bbc with at least two detectors firing in each of them and a requirement of the collision vertex position , to be within @xmath20  cm .",
    "based on detailed simulations of the bbc , this trigger reflects [ @xmath21% of the nuclear interaction cross section of 7.2 barns .",
    "more information on the trigger selection can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the data sample used in this analysis consists of 137,784 events taken with zero magnetic field .",
    "the number of primary charged particles per event was determined on a statistical basis by correlating hits in pc1 and pc3 in the east arm , rather than by explicit track reconstruction , using the following algorithm : all hits in pc3 are combined with all hits in pc1 and the resulting lines are projected onto a plane through the beam line , symmetrically placed with respect to the tracking arm .",
    "this distribution of the distance r from the track intersection point to the event vertex is shown in fig.[fig : rpro ] .",
    "two main classes of tracks contribute to it : real tracks ( peaking at low r ) and tracks from the obvious combinatorial background inherent to the adopted procedure .",
    "the latter can be determined by a mixed event technique ; in the present analysis , each sector in pc1 was exchanged with its neighbor and the resulting combinatorial background is shown in fig.[fig : rpro ] by the dotted line .",
    "the yield of this background increases quadratically with r ( leading to a linear dependence in the differential dn / dr vs. r presentation of fig.[fig : rpro ] ) .",
    "the r distribution of real tracks is obtained by subtracting an average background on an event - by - event basis from the total number of tracks .",
    "the sharp peak in the distribution    l8 cm    at small r is due to tracks from primary particles originating at the vertex and the long tail to in - flight decay products of primary particles .    the total number of real tracks determined after background subtraction has to be corrected for several factors : corrections of 15.3% and 1.2% account for inactive regions and inefficiency in both pc layers , respectively",
    ". the number of tracks outside the acceptance window ( 25  cm ) amount to 4.3% .",
    "the track losses due to the finite double hit resolution of the pc depend on the event multiplicity .",
    "the losses are due to two effects : the direct counting of tracks ( 13.3% for the 5% most central collisions ) and the subtraction of the combinatorial background by event mixing ( 3.6% of the background ) .",
    "finally , a 2.8% correction takes into account the effect of charged and neutral particle decay in flight .",
    "a geometrical scaling factor of 5.82 allows to convert the corrected number of tracks to the charged particle multiplicity in one unit of pseudorapidity .",
    "the systematic errors were thoroughly studied using both the data and the guidance from detailed monte carlo simulations . the total systematic error amounts to 6.5% at the highest multiplicities .",
    "see  @xcite for more details about the analysis .",
    "the absolute scale of the emcal was pre - calibrated during construction by cosmic - ray muons and in - situ by monitoring the minimum ionizing peak of relativistic charged hadrons and identified high momentum electrons .",
    "the @xmath22 mass , reconstructed from pairs of emcal clusters of total energy greater than 2 gev is shown in fig.[fig : pion ] , and is found to be within 1.5% of the true value .",
    "l8 cm    the transverse energy @xmath23 was computed for each event using clusters of minimum energy of 20mev , from individual towers with deposited energy of more than 3mev .",
    "the angle of the cluster was computed from the centroid of its energy assuming a particle originating from the event vertex .",
    "a correction factor of 1.17 converts the measured @xmath23 to the total @xmath23 in the fiducial aperture of the emcal , and includes the response of the detector to charged and neutral particles from the event vertex and for energy in- and out - flow from the fiducial aperture .",
    "this factor was determined from a full monte carlo simulation of the detector , using hijing  @xcite as event generator . a correction of 3% accounts for disabled calorimeter towers . a scaling factor of 10.6 converts the total measured @xmath23 value into the transverse energy in one unit of pheudorapidity .",
    "the systematic error of the measurement was determined to be 4.5% independent of multiplicity . for more details",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "centrality classes were determined based on the zdc vs. bbc response and related to the number of participating nucleons ( @xmath24 ) and binary collisions ( @xmath25 ) using a glauber model  @xcite .",
    "the measured distributions of @xmath26 and @xmath27 at mid - rapidity are shown in fig.[fig : distr ] .",
    "both quantities show very similar behavior .",
    "the peak at low values corresponds to peripheral events , the middle region to mid - central collisions and the fall - off to the most central events .",
    "the shape of the fall - off is mainly determined by the limited detector acceptance rather than by real fluctuations .",
    "the lower axis in each plot corresponds to the measured distribution calculated for one unit of pseudorapidity .",
    "the four bell - shape curves in each plot show the distribution of the 20% most central events in steps of 5% .",
    "fig.[fig : centr ] shows the multiplicity and the transverse energy per pair of @xmath24 vs @xmath24 .",
    "one can see that the extrapolation to @xmath28 of the measured @xmath1 points is in agreement with the ua5 data for pp  @xcite .",
    "the figure also shows the results obtained by wa98  @xcite at @xmath4  gev .",
    "the curves represent a fit to the data points with @xmath29 ( @xmath30 or @xmath31 ) as used in  @xcite . for @xmath26",
    "one finds @xmath32 for phenix whereas @xmath33 and @xmath34 for wa98 and wa97/na57  @xcite respectively . for @xmath27 the phenix value is @xmath35 compared to @xmath36 for wa98 .",
    "one can conclude that at rhic energies both measured quantities show a consistent increase with centrality , with an @xmath37 value clearly larger then one , whereas at the sps energy @xmath37 was found to be very close to 1 .",
    "fig.[fig : models ] compares the measured @xmath26 with the theoretical predictions of the ekrt  @xcite saturation model and hijing  @xcite .",
    "the increase of @xmath26 with @xmath24 is in contrast to the prediction of the ekrt model , and in qualitative agreement to hijing , however the latter underpredicts the yield by @xmath3815% .",
    "following hijing , one can assume that the increase is due to `` hard '' processes that scale with @xmath25 and fit the results with the parameterization @xmath39 .",
    "one finds that the ratio @xmath40 for @xmath26 is @xmath41 . for the @xmath27 the ratio @xmath42 .",
    "the large errors are due to the negative correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , in the framework of the hijing model the `` hard '' contribution grows from @xmath3830% for the 45 - 50% centrality bin to @xmath3850% for the most central bin ( 0 - 5% ) .",
    "rapidity densities per @xmath24 obtained in different experiments are shown in  fig.[fig : sqrts ] as a function of the center of mass energy .",
    "the compiled data were measured for different centrality percentiles ( values shown in brackets ) in the center of mass system for phenix and phobos or laboratory system for all other experiments . in making this figure",
    "it was assumed that @xmath45 in the lab system and factors of 1.19 at @xmath0  gev and 1.24 at @xmath46  gev were used to account for the @xmath47 transformation in the c.m . system .",
    "the phenix result is in good agreement with the recent phobos measurement . comparing the mean values for rhic and",
    "sps shows that the particle and transverse energy production per participant increase by @xmath3% .",
    "the data points are consistent with @xmath48 behaviour over a broad range of energies .",
    "finally , fig.[fig : rat_sqrts ] shows the ratio @xmath5 of the transverse energy per charged particle .",
    "the ratio stays constant , equal to 0.8  gev over a broad range of centralities , as was also observed by wa98 .",
    "moreover , the ratio , stays also constant as a function of @xmath49 , from ags to sps and up to rhic energies .    9 s.a .",
