    "recently undoped vanadium oxides , such as lavo@xmath3 or yvo@xmath3 , have attracted much attention due to their puzzling magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "large on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath10 ev between @xmath11 electrons leads to suppression of charge fluctuations and to the effective superexchange ( se ) interaction @xmath12 in the low energy range , where @xmath13 ev is the hopping element .",
    "the cubic vanadates belong to the class of mott insulators with orbital degeneracy as two @xmath14 electrons , localized on the v@xmath15 ion , occupy two out of three ( almost ) degenerate @xmath8 orbitals . thus , the se model includes @xmath8 orbital degrees of freedom @xcite , and _ by itself _ explains the observed @xmath0-type antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase in lavo@xmath3 , with ferromagnetic ( fm ) chains staggered in two other directions .",
    "even more interesting and not yet understood are the properties of doped la@xmath1sr@xmath2vo@xmath3 , where the following phases were experimentally observed : @xmath0-af and insulating one up to @xmath16 hole concentration , @xmath0-af metallic one for @xmath17 , and , finally , paramagnetic and metallic one for @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "theoretical explanation of the existence of this variety of phases has to take into account that the motion of doped holes is strongly affected by : ( @xmath19 ) intersite se interaction @xmath20 , ( @xmath21 ) on - site hund s interaction @xmath22 ev @xcite .",
    "such a theoretical model was recently discussed by ishihara @xcite , but there the hund s term was introduced in a nonsystematic way via certain projection operators , with @xmath23 limit being assumed implicitly , and the model was solved in a way suitable for small doping only . here",
    "we start with an appropriate kondo - lattice model , systematically introduce the large @xmath6 limit in which the kinetic and the hund s parts of the hamiltonian reduce to the double exchange ( de ) model @xcite , and solve it for any realistic value of doping . since in this paper we are mainly concerned with the explanation of the existence of the metallic phase and the associated magnetic order , we will simplify the se part of the hamiltonian as much as possible and investigate only the competition of the de and the generic se interaction due to the occupied @xmath4 obitals ( @xmath24 ) , leaving the study of the full hamiltonian as a future problem .",
    "in particular we want to answer three questions : ( @xmath19 ) can @xmath0-af and metallic phase be predicted by de , ( @xmath21 ) if yes , then why such a phase contradicts the `` intuitive '' picture of the de mechanism which supports homogenous fm phase , and ( @xmath25 ) in what way the generic features of degenerate @xmath8 orbitals help to understand the answers obtained in points ( @xmath19 ) and ( @xmath21 ) , especially the differences to the case of the @xmath26 electrons , playing a role in the manganites @xcite .",
    "thereby , we shall use a similar approximation to that employed in manganites @xcite , assuming localized @xmath4 electrons and treating them as `` core spins '' .",
    "for the sake of clarity we start with a fm kondo - lattice hamiltonian but we already include important simplifications in the se part : @xmath27 where : @xmath28 are `` core spin '' @xmath5 operators of @xmath8 electrons in occupied @xmath4 orbitals , and @xmath29 is a vector of pauli matrices .",
    "the fermion operators @xmath30 create an electron with spin @xmath31 in @xmath32 and @xmath33 orbitals , labeled here as @xmath34 and @xmath35 as these orbitals have no amplitude along @xmath34 and @xmath35 axis @xcite , respectively .",
    "in the relevant regime of large coulomb interaction @xmath9 , the fermion operators act in the restricted hilbert space without double occupancies in the @xmath36 orbitals which is implemented by the projection operators @xmath37 .",
    "then : ( @xmath19 ) itinerant electrons in @xmath32 or @xmath33 degenerate orbitals at site @xmath38 can hop in the allowed [ @xmath39 or @xmath40 plane to the nearest neighbor ( nn ) site @xmath19 , but _ only _ if there are no other electrons at site @xmath19 in these orbitals ( first and second term ) , ( @xmath21 ) hund s exchange @xmath41 aligns spins of itinerant electrons with `` core spins '' ( third terms ) , and ( @xmath25 ) occupied @xmath4 orbitals are responsible for af se interactions between nn sites in the @xmath42 plane ( last term ) , while the se interactions due to itinerant electrons are not included .",
    "the above simplifications in the se part @xmath20 are motivated by the experimental observation that the structural transitions ( which favor the orbital order and occupied @xmath4 orbitals ) occur in la@xmath1sr@xmath2vo@xmath3 at lower temperature than the magnetic ones in the entire doping range @xcite .",
    "note that the structural transition does not occur in the metallic phase and then one does not expect any orbital order , similar to the fm metallic manganites @xcite",
    ". note that the se interactions due to the excitations of @xmath32 and @xmath33 electrons could in principle be included , and would : ( @xmath19 ) enhance the af interactions and induce their alternating orbital ( ao ) order in @xmath42 planes , and ( @xmath21 ) would give fm interactions along the @xmath43 direction , and thus further stabilize the @xmath0-af phase @xcite .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we treat `` core spins '' @xmath5 classically and we make a local unitary transformation of the basis @xmath44 in the hilbert space .",
    "the transformation makes the quantization axes of the spin of an itinerant electron locally parallel to the one of the `` core spin '' , and thus it diagonalizes hund s term in the spin variables . assuming also infinite hund s exchange @xmath45 , we leave out the itinerant electrons with antiparallel spin and what is left is a renormalized ( _ a priori _ nonhomogenous ) hopping @xmath46 of spinless electrons .",
    "the absolute value of the complex parameter @xmath47 is @xmath48 , with @xmath49 being the relative angle between `` core spins '' at site @xmath19 and @xmath38 ( the phase of @xmath47 can be chosen arbitrarily at @xmath50 ) .",
    "furthermore , we will discuss only uniform magnetic structures and follow the so - called uniform hopping approach ( uha ) @xcite .",
    "one obtains then the following _ classical _",
    "( i.e. zener - type @xcite ) de hamiltonian : @xmath51 where : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath55 is the relative angle between spins in the @xmath56 @xmath57 direction and @xmath58 is the number of sites in the crystal .",
    "the restricted fermion creation operators are now @xmath59 , @xmath60  @xmath61 creates a spinless electron at site @xmath19 in @xmath62 orbital .",
    "the fm order along the @xmath43 direction is already assumed in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) as it minimalizes the total energy of the system by maximalizing the possibility of hopping in this direction .",
    "note that all but one ( spin 1/2 being classical ) of the assumptions necessary to derive eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) seem to be reasonable approximations for cubic vanadates _ and _ for investigation of the problems adressed in section [ sec:1 ] .",
    "we leave quantum treatment of the de for further studies but we believe that the main features of the de mechanism in cubic vanadates can be captured by this classical hamiltonian .     obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) within sbmf approximation .",
    "under increasing hole doping @xmath63 , the @xmath0-af order changes via the canted ca * * phase , with spins canted on two bonds , to a homogenous fm phase.,width=207,height=170 ]",
    "the ground state of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) was found by introducing kotliar - ruckenstein slave boson representation @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we adopted this method to the orbital case and made the mean - field approximation ( the unrestricted slave boson method , identical with the gutzwiller approximation and called sbmf ) .",
    "it leads to the effective hopping terms in @xmath64 : @xmath65 where : @xmath66 @xmath67 are pseudofermion creation operators for @xmath32 @xmath68 orbital , and @xmath69 @xmath70 are hole numbers in these orbitals with the constraint @xmath71 . now",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) is exactly solvable by minimizing the total energy with respect to the @xmath72 and @xmath73 variational parameters @xcite , which determine the magnetic structure .",
    "the resulting magnetic phases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for different values of se @xmath74 and hole doping @xmath63 .",
    "we should stress that equal number of holes in both orbitals ( @xmath75 ) is always concomitant with the obtained magnetic phases , though we did not impose such a condition .",
    "this result follows almost entirely from the fermion properties of the system , namely the condition that the fermi energies of the systems with electrons filling partly @xmath32 orbitals and @xmath33 orbitals should be the same .",
    "note also that @xmath75 is a neccessary condtion for the existence of the ao order .",
    "thus , including real se interactions from section [ sec:1 ] : ( @xmath19 ) would not contradict our results in the orbital sector , ( @xmath21 ) would only further support the stability of the @xmath0-af phase in the spin sector , which is already stable for a broad range of parameters .    let us further analyze these results .",
    "one finds that for the broad range of realistic values of parameters , the de mechanism does not win in @xmath76 planes , which instead have af order and are insulating , while the holes hop only along the fm @xmath43 direction . in this way",
    "the @xmath0-af order characterized by the _ one - dimensional metallic _",
    "behavior is stabilized .",
    "remarkably , such a phase is stable for @xmath17 and @xmath77 , in agreement with the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "these results are striking since at the first sight one expects that the de should win here due to the small `` core spin '' value @xmath5 , much smaller than in the manganites ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "instead we get results which are qualitatively similar to those obtained by van den brink and khomskii in the de model for electron doped srmno@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "though , the reason is different  this behavior here follows from very specific features of @xmath8 orbitals : ( @xmath19 ) the af se interactions are strictly two - dimensional ( 2d ) since for the occupied @xmath4 electrons virtual hopping processes ( leading to the se ) can occur only in the @xmath76 plane  this enables metallic behavior without any loss of the magnetic energy ( hopping in the @xmath43 direction does not destroy the magnetic order ) ; ( @xmath21 ) in addition , the itinerant electrons hop between _ the other two _ @xmath8 orbitals , allowing for the coexistence of the magnetic order and the metallic behavior , and costing no extra magnetic energy .    to understand better this behavior we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) stable magnetic structures in the @xmath79 direction for the systems with 2d planar ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) af interactions , and holes being doped _ only _ into @xmath33 orbital , i.e. , assuming empty @xmath32 orbitals , @xmath81 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we also studied the above case but when the hopping between @xmath33 orbitals occurs only along the @xmath79 direction , which resembles holes doped into @xmath82 orbitals in the manganites [ stable phases are displayed in fig . [ fig:2](b ) ] .",
    "one finds that for this @xmath26-type orbital the canted ( ca ) structure is stabilized in a broad range of parameters , in contrast with @xmath8 case where af order in the plane can be conserved .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the af order along the @xmath43 direction can be so easily destabilized by doping in lamno@xmath3 , leading to the fm metallic phase @xcite . by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) , one can also realize better the role of orbital degeneracy : even if we had a system with planar af interactions and we doped it with holes into , e.g. , @xmath33 orbitals , we would not get the af plane stable for a _ realistic _",
    "range of parameters !",
    "instead , one af bond has to be broken .",
    "this tendency is suppressed if we have two degenerate orbitals as in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) .    ,",
    "with displayed magnetic order along the @xmath79 axis , as obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) and assuming : ( a ) no electrons in @xmath32 orbital , and ( b ) _ in addition _ no hopping along the @xmath43 direction .",
    "the af order for @xmath83 [ marked in grey ( red online ) ] was found by finite size scaling of the results obtained for large clusters .",
    "note that the af ( fm ) order is stable in the entire range of @xmath63 along the @xmath80 ( @xmath43 ) axis [ though the type of order along @xmath43 direction does not matter in ( b ) ] . ]    in summary , we have shown that the existence of the metallic @xmath0-af phase in doped la@xmath1sr@xmath2vo@xmath3 can be explained by the de model with extremely simplified se interactions .",
    "the stability of this phase is due to the specific features of the @xmath8 orbitals  namely due to strictly 2d and strictly flavor conserving hopping between these degenerate orbitals @xcite . in our view",
    "these are very prospective results and , in connection with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , they suggest that including the real se interactions could indeed explain the observed insulating phase and the metal - insulator transition which occurs at finite doping ."
