    "supernovae ( sne ) are milestones of galaxy evolution , and the knowledge of the supernova rate is an essential means for constraining the mechanisms of galaxy formation and for understanding galaxy evolution .",
    "for example , canizares , fabbiano & trincheri ( 1987 ) find that the explosion of type ia sne can have a strong influence on the properties of the x - ray emitting gas in early type galaxies , and renzini _ et al .",
    "_   ( 1993 ) argue that the production of iron in systems that at the present epoch have a reduced or totally exhausted star formation activity , such as the elliptical galaxies , dramatically depends on the rate of type ia events .",
    "thus , any mechanism capable of producing an enhancement of snia rate in this type of galaxies should be regarded with the highest interest .",
    "two recent works , by capetti ( 2002 ) and by livio , riess and sparks ( 2002 ) , deal with this possibility . capetti ( 2002 ) finds a close association between the position of 6 type ia sne discovered in radiogalaxies and their jets , while livio _ et al . _  ( 2002 ) claim the detection of an enhancement of the nova rate in m87 in the regions near its jet .",
    "the former result would indicate that type ia sne in radiogalaxies show a statistically significant preference ( at the level of @xmath7 ) to occur close to their jets .",
    "the latter result may suggest that the presence of jets could increase the accretion rate from the interstellar medium onto the white dwarfs up to @xmath8m@xmath9 yr@xmath10 , which is the rate necessary to trigger classical nova explosions ( prialnik & kovetz 1995 ) . by combining the two results",
    ", one would infer that the presence of the jets may increase the efficiency of accretion rate from the ism and drive an accreting white dwarf to approach the chandrasekhar mass and ignite , according to the standard single - degenerate model , a snia explosion ( livio _ et al . _  2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "in this scenario it is the jet itself that alters the physical conditions of its environment and thus it is the _ direct cause _ of a local enhancement of nova and type ia sn explosions .    since jets are outstanding signatures of radiogalaxies ( e.g. bicknell 2002 ) , it is important to extend the investigation to all galaxies with strong radio emission and to study the snia rate as a function of the radio activity . in this letter",
    "we will use the available sn databases to investigate if , and to which extent radiogalaxies exhibit an over - production of type ia sne with respect to quiescent galaxies of the same class of luminosity , and to clarify what is the dominant mechanism that drives this process . in the following",
    ", we will denote as _ radio - loud _ sources , or _ radiogalaxies _ , all galaxies which have radio luminosities at 1.4ghz higher than @xmath11 erg s@xmath10 hz@xmath10 , and m@xmath12 ( e.g. sadler , jenkins , & kotanyi 1989 , ledlow & owen 1996 ) and _ radio - quiet _ all galaxies with radio luminosities below that threshold .",
    "the threshold value of @xmath13 erg @xmath14 hz@xmath10 is the bottom limit of the luminosity function for the radio - galaxies of ` low ' radio luminosity ( see also urry & padovani 1995 ) , and , therefore , it represents the most natural threshold to identify `` radio - loud '' galaxies .",
    "among the several databases on supernovae currently available , we consider the one compiled by van den bergh , clure and evans ( 1987 ) and evans , van den bergh and clure ( 1989 ) , which has the advantage of being based on a very homogeneous and systematic set of observations so as to provide , in addition to other relevant parameters , the control time for each monitored galaxy , which is a fundamental quantity to correctly estimate any sn explosion rate .",
    "in addition we note that the evans s sample of galaxies was necessarily defined ` a priori ' , i.e. the galaxies to be monitored were selected before the sn explosions , and therefore our statistical analysis does nt suffer of any kind of ` a posteriori ' selection criteria , which actually may affect the statistical analysis carried out on compilations of parent galaxies of sne .",

    "i.e. _  the time during which a given galaxy has been observed , to the galaxy s b - band absolute luminosity , so that is given in units of years @xmath15 10@xmath1 l@xmath20 .",
    "this indeed is the appropriate quantity to use in order to derive sn explosion rates per unit luminosity .",
    "an inspection to tab .",
    "1 reveals the following facts :    \\i ) evans sample is not biased in favor of bright galaxies . as apparent from fig .  1 , the distribution of monitored galaxies agrees remarkably well with a typical luminosity function of early type galaxies , i.e. a schechter s ( 1976 ) function with @xmath21 and m@xmath22=20.88 for an adopted h@xmath23=50  km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 ( _ e.g. _  muriel , nicotra & lambas 1995 ) .",
    "\\ii ) the fraction of radio galaxies in evans sample is @xmath24 of the whole sample of galaxies ( _ c.f .",
    "_  fig .  1 ) .",
    "such fraction is marginally smaller than @xmath25 as reported by ledlow & owen ( 1996 ) for radio galaxies having the same radio luminosities ( @xmath26 erg s@xmath10 hz@xmath10 at 1.4ghz ) .",
    "this indicates that the frequency of radio galaxies in evans sample is not affected by biases related to their radio properties .",
    "\\iii ) considering all early type galaxies , regardless of their radio properties , an overall snia rate of @xmath27 snu(50  km  s@xmath10  mpc)@xmath10 ; @xmath28 ( 10@xmath29)@xmath10 ] is obtained .",
    "this value compares favorably with the most recent determination of the rate of type ia sne in early type galaxies by cappellaro _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) who give an average of @xmath31 snu ( for an adopted h@xmath32 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 ) , and confirms the high statistical value of evans sample .",
    "\\iv ) separating radio - loud from radio - quiet galaxies , we have 4 snia events in radio - loud galaxies and 0 in radio - quiet galaxies .",
    "therefore , we can estimate the rate of type ia sne for radio - loud galaxies to be @xmath33 snu ( the errors are estimated from a direct application of poisson statistics ) .",
    "the snia rate in radio - loud galaxies is a factor @xmath34 higher than the one deduced by cappellaro _ et al . _  ( 1999 ) for the overall rate of snia events in early type galaxies .",
    "this is clear evidence for a strong enhancement of snia explosions in radio galaxies , especially considering that cappellaro _",
    "et al . _",
    "rate includes both contributions from quiescent and radio galaxies , and , therefore , the actual ratio of snia rates in radio - loud galaxies to radio - quiet galaxies should be appreciably higher than @xmath34 , say , 10 or more .    the null result for radio - quiet galaxies can also provide interesting constraints on the snia rate in theses galaxies .",
    "in particular , from simple poisson statistics we find that the probabilities of obtaining a null result are 50% , 16% and 5% when the expected values are 0.7 , 1.8 , and 3.0 .",
    "correspondingly , one should expect that the snia rate in radio - quiet galaxies be likely higher than the 50% probability value , _",
    "i.e. _  0.03@xmath35  snu , possibly around the 16% value , 0.08@xmath35  snu , and hardly higher than the 5% probability value , 0.13@xmath35  snu . note that since 0.13@xmath35  snu is equal to the estimated overall snia rate , it must really regarded as a strict upper limit to the snia rate for radio - quite galaxies .",
    "therefore , just using results from evans sample , we conclude that the ratio of the snia rate in radio - loud galaxies is definitely higher than 0.47/0.13=3.6 times the one in radio - quiet galaxies , and may be as high as 0.47/0.03@xmath3615 .",
    "an analysis of evans _ et al . _  ( 1989 ) database provides strong evidence that the rate of type ia sne in radiogalaxies is about 6 times higher than the rate measured in quiescent galaxies , _ i.e. _   @xmath33 snu ( this paper ) as compared to @xmath37 @xmath35snu as deduced approximately from evans sample itself , or inferred from cappellaro _ et al . _  ( 1999 ) results based on the analysis of a richer sample of early type galaxies .",
    "the actual value of the enhancement is still uncertain , due to the use of somewhat scanty statistics , but is likely to be in the range @xmath4 .",
    "databases of sne currently available in literature and characterized by larger number of sne than the evans one , do not report the complete set of data , _",
    "i.e. _  the sample of monitored galaxies and the control time for each of them , and , therefore , they can not be used for our detailed analysis .",
    "once the correlation of a high snia rate with strong radio emission is established , one wonders what is the causality link between the two phenomena .",
    "_ a priori _ , the strong enhancement of the rate of snia events in radio galaxies may be explained in basically three different ways :    \\1 ) _ the high snia explosion rate is the cause of strong radio emission in some elliptical galaxies .",
    "_ this scenario is as interesting as unlikely .",
    "first of all , it is generally accepted that that the bulk of the radio emission from strong radio galaxies is mostly associated with relativistic jet activity , presumably powered by accretion on central massive black holes .",
    "second , one has to consider that substantial radio emission is associated exclusively with core collapse sne ( at a level of several @xmath38 erg @xmath14 hz@xmath10 ; see , e.g. weiler et al .",
    "2002 ) , but no type ii or ib / c sn has ever been discovered in early type galaxies ( van den bergh et al .",
    "2002 ) . under the hypothesis that the whole core - collapse sn population be responsable for the observed radio emission of radiogalaxies",
    ", one should invoke the simultaneous presence of several hundreds to many thousands core collapse sne in radio galaxies and require that they all be heavily obscured .",
    "this possibility is very unlikely because , among other problems , would require a sn rate of about @xmath39 sne / century or higher : this is a very high value that is inconsistent with observational evidence .",
    "another possibility to consider is that it is the kinetic energy from sn explosions that feeds the strong emission of radio - loud ellipticals .",
    "however , the absolute rate of sne of all types _ per unit mass _ in elliptical galaxies , even with strong radio emission , is more than 10 times lower than that of late type galaxies ( _ e.g. _  della valle & livio 1994 , panagia 2000 , mannucci _ et al . _  2003 ) .",
    "therefore , the input of kinetic energy from sn explosions is at least 10 times lower in radio loud ellipticals than it is in normal spirals , but , at the same time , the radio power from spirals is substantially lower than that of radio - loud elliptical galaxies ( _ e.g. _  gioia , gregorini & vettolani 1981 ) .",
    "since the ism conditions greatly favor spiral galaxies over ellipticals in transforming the sn kinetic energy into radio emission , and , still , the former are weaker radio emitters than the latter , we can confidently exclude that sne be the cause of strong radio emission in elliptical galaxies .",
    "\\2 ) _ the enhanced snia explosion rate in radio - loud galaxies is a direct consequence of their being strong radio sources_. this is the scenario suggested by capetti ( 2002 ) and livio _ et al . _",
    "2002 . in radiogalaxies the accretion rate from the interstellar medium onto white dwarfs could be enhanced by the action of the jets .",
    "this process could also account for the high rate of novae observed in m87 in the regions nearby the jets .",
    "the association between type ia sne and jets requires a further step , _",
    "i.e. _  that the progenitors of these snei - a are cataclysmic - type systems , according to the single degenerate scenario . in this hypothesis",
    ", the enhancement of snia in radio galaxies is expected to be spatially confined to the regions immediately adjacent to radio jets and/or the bulk of radio activity .",
    "while this may be true for virgo  a = m87 , it appears not to be the case for fornax  a = ngc  1316 , in which the two snia ( sn 1980n and sn 1981d ) are located quite far from strong radio lobes ( geldzahler & fomalont 1984 ) , nor for centaurus  a = ngc  5128 , in which sn  1986 g is deeply embedded in the equatorial lane of gas and dust . at any rate ,",
    "if the dominant phenomenon is accretion from the ism rather than from a binary companion , an extreme consequence would be that _",
    "single _ wds will contribute to nova and perhaps snia production , and not only binary systems with suitable parameters .",
    "actually , since the fraction of binary systems that may give rise to a snia is only 5 - 10% of the total number of systems with masses above 3 m@xmath9  ( madau , della valle & panagia  1998 ) , one should expect a very dramatic increase of the snia rate in jet dominated radio - galaxies , by factors as high as 30 or higher if direct accretion from ism becomes the dominant accretion process .",
    "\\3 ) a third possibility that we strongly favor is that _ the enhancement of snia explosion rate in radio - loud galaxies has the same common origin as their being strong radio sources , but there is no causality link between the two phenomena_. indeed , the radio activity of a galaxy is most likely triggered by interaction and/or mergers ( e.g. baade & minkowski 1954 , balick & heckman 1982 , heckman _",
    "et al . _  1986",
    "also , the snia rate can be enhanced by the formation or the capture of relatively young stellar populations in which snia occur at much higher rates than in genuinely old populations .",
    "snia progenitors are stars with original masses above @xmath53  m@xmath9 , having nuclear - burning lifetimes shorter than @xmath5400  myrs .",
    "after that time , the star becomes a white dwarf and may explode as a snia only after an additional time as needed for either accreting mass from a companion or merging with it .",
    "such a time is essentially unconstrained by theory , but measurements of snia rates at different redshifts suggest that it should be shorter than @xmath51  gyrs ( _ e.g. _  madau _ et al . _  1998 ,",
    "pain _ et al . _",
    "2002 ) . as a consequence , in order to sustain a substantial rate of snia explosion , a galaxy has to have a steady supply of young stellar populations , at least over a time - scale of 1 - 2  gyrs . in late type galaxies",
    ", the active star formation provides the needed input for a steady production of snia events .",
    "such a supply in early type galaxies is naturally provided by repeated episodes of interaction or mergers that induces either formation of young stellar populations ( galaxy interaction ; _",
    "e.g. _  the antennae galaxies , whitmore _",
    "et al . _",
    "1999 ) or capture of young stars from dwarf companions .",
    "well known examples of interacting and/or merging early type galaxies are centaurus  a = ngc  5128 and fornax  a = ngc  1316 , which are strong radio sources and indeed have produced 1 + 2 snia in the last century .",
    "moreover , the virgo cluster radiogalaxy ngc 4753 , which is a parent galaxy to one of the snia in evans sample ( sn1983 g ) , had given birth to another snia ( sn1965i ) less than two decades before , thus confirming its high snia rate .",
    "also in favor of this hypothesis is the fact that the observed snia rates are higher in late type galaxies than in early type galaxies ( about a factor of 10 between ellipticals and sd galaxies ) once the rates are normalized to the galaxy h or k band luminosities , and , therefore , to their masses in stars , rather than to their b - band magnitudes ( della valle & livio 1994 , panagia 2000 , della valle _ et al . _  2003 ) .",
    "this fact confirms the connection between recent stellar populations and type ia supernovae , and provides a natural explanation of why among early type galaxies are snia rates higher in radiogalaxies , without requiring the concurrence of any new and/or additional process to enhance the snia rates .",
    "in addition , we note that recently howell ( 2001 ) ( see also ivanov , hamuy and pinto 2000 ) has found convincing evidence that snia properties correlate with the host galaxy types . in particular , out of a total sample of 67 snia selected from branch , fisher and nugent ( 1999 ) , li _ et al . _  ( 2001 ) , barbon _ et al . _  ( 1999 ) and phillips et al . 1999",
    "compilations , howell found that : _",
    "i ) _ underluminous snia are twice more common in early type galaxies than in late type galaxies ( 17 _ vs _ 8) , _ ii ) _ overluminous snia are much more common in late type galaxies than in early type galaxies ( 15 _ vs _ 2 ) , and _",
    "iii ) _ overluminous snia in early type galaxies have been found in radio - loud galaxies only ( 2 ) .",
    "these facts can easily be understood in terms of a picture in which most early type galaxies have to  scrap the bottom of the barrel \" for snia progenitors and only in those galaxies that have undergone recent interaction / merging episodes may one find the overluminous snia that are believed to be produced in younger systems from the most massive snia progenitors ( _ e.g. _  tutukov & yungelson 1994 , 1996 , ruiz - lapuente , burkert & canal 1995 ) . on the other hand , late type galaxies , thanks to their intrinsically active star formation , and regardless of whether they are interacting / merging with other galaxies , have an abundant and steady supply of snia progenitors of all appropriate masses and , therefore , can have a higher production of overluminous snia .",
    "a corollary is that the average absolute luminosity of snia at maximum light is higher for late type galaxies than early type galaxies , as observed ( della valle & panagia 1992 , hamuy et al .",
    "1995 , hamuy _ et al . _  2000",
    "it is also expected that a number of snia , but not all , be produced in the direct vicinities of radio jets and/or radio lobes because at the early stages of the interaction those are the locations where star formation may be highest .",
    "clearly , this scenario can easily account for all different aspects of snia properties in galaxies of different morphological types and different radio activity .",
    "finally , we note that in our scenario the occurrence of a few type ii - ib / c sne in early type galaxies is expected at the early stages of the same star formation burst that provides a steady supply of snia events .",
    "since core collapse sne are produced by progenitors more massive than 8m@xmath9 , whose lifetime is shorter than about 30 myrs , only for a small fraction of the time between subsequent interaction / capture episodes ( approximately 30myrs/1gyr=3% ) would one expect to see such sne in early type galaxies .",
    "since in galaxies with active star formation the rate of core collapse sne is about 4 times higher than that of snia , we estimate that one should expect core collapse sne to occur at an average rate of about 0.03@xmath40 12% that of snia events .",
    "this , however , is still not the probability of detecting core - collapse sne as compared to snia because we have to consider that core - collapse sne are generally fainter than snia , and that the former may go undetected because of strong dust extinction ( such as present in the dust lane of cen  a ) . neglecting dust extinction , but folding in the facts that snii / snibc have a median peak luminosity that is about two magnitudes fainter than snia and that as many as @xmath525% of the core - collapse sne may be as bright as snia ( richardson _ et al . _  2002 ) , we estimate that the overall probability of _ actually detecting _ core - collapse sne in a magnitude limited - sample is about 4% of that of snia events .",
    "such a small percentage , which may be further reduced by extinction , can explain why no snii / snibc have been detected in radio - loud elliptical galaxies so far .",
    "nevertheless , we predict that increasing the sample of radio - loud elliptical galaxies searched appreciably , one will eventually detect core - collapse sne in such early type galaxies .",
    "we thank paolo padovani for useful discussions on radio galaxies , and an anonymous referee for valuable comments .",
