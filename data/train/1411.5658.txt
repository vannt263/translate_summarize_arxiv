    "the recent observation of ultra - high energy ( uhe ) neutrino events at icecube  @xcite in previously uncharted energy regime has commenced a new era in neutrino astrophysics . following the initial two events around 1 pev deposited energy  @xcite ,",
    "additional 26 events were found in the 30 - 400 tev energy range  @xcite with the 2-year dataset .",
    "more recently , further 9 events were reported with the 3-year dataset  @xcite , with one event at 2 pev , the highest - energy neutrino interaction ever observed in nature .",
    "together , the observed total of 37 candidate events reject a purely atmospheric explanation at @xmath0  @xcite and strongly suggest an extra - terrestrial origin .",
    "this provides a unique opportunity to _ directly _ probe the energetic physical processes occurring in dense astrophysical environments , which are otherwise inaccessible with traditional messengers like photons or charged particles in cosmic rays .",
    "it is imperative for both astrophysics and particle physics to understand all possible aspects of the uhe neutrino events , and in particular , to extract information on the possible source(s ) and the underlying spectral shape of the astrophysical neutrino flux ( for reviews , see e.g.  @xcite ) . since no significant clustering",
    "is observed  @xcite and there is no evidence for point - like sources of astrophysical neutrinos  @xcite , the current data suggests either many isotropically distributed point sources or some spatially extended sources .",
    "moreover , most of the uhe neutrino events have arrival directions in high galactic latitudes  @xcite , thereby suggesting a dominant extragalactic component  @xcite , which could be attributed to various astrophysical sources .-",
    "ray sources at the galactic center  @xcite or the interstellar medium  @xcite can not be ruled out yet . ]",
    "typical examples are cosmic - ray ( cr ) reservoirs like star - burst galaxies and galaxy clusters / groups  @xcite , cr accelerators like active galactic nuclei ( agns )  @xcite , gamma - ray bursts  @xcite and newborn pulsars  @xcite , or even charmed meson decays in mildly relativistic jets of supernovae  @xcite .",
    "a cosmogenic source due to uhecr interactions with the cmb background  @xcite is now disfavored  @xcite .",
    "there are two conventional production sources of uhe neutrinos from interactions of uhecrs in a dense astrophysical system  @xcite , namely , ( i ) hadro - nuclear production by inelastic @xmath1 or @xmath2 scattering in cosmic - ray reservoirs like starburst galaxies and galaxy clusters / groups , and ( ii ) photo - hadronic production by @xmath3 scattering in cosmic ray accelerators like grbs and agn . both kinds of sources produce charged pions / kaons , whose subsequent decays are expected to give rise to astrophysical neutrinos . for charged pions produced by @xmath1 scattering , isospin invariance yields a roughly equal ratio of @xmath4 and @xmath5 production , and the subsequent decay chain @xmath6 leads to a flavor composition of ( @xmath7:@xmath8:@xmath9)@xmath10=(1:2:0)@xmath10 at the source ( s ) .",
    "note that the kinematics of the decay chain is such that each neutrino in the decay chain carries off roughly equal energy  @xcite .",
    "after the neutrino oscillations are averaged over an astronomical distance scale , the final composition on earth ( e ) becomes ( 1:1:1)@xmath11  @xcite for a tri - bi - maximal ( tbm ) neutrino mixing pattern  @xcite .",
    "the flux of neutrinos coming from @xmath1 collisions follows that of the progenitor protons , which is typically a power - law spectrum @xmath12 with @xmath13 for a diffusive fermi - shock acceleration mechanism , whereas the neutrino flux due to @xmath3 collisions has a strong @xmath14 resonance peak , and therefore , falls off at lower energies  @xcite .    using the ( 1:1:1)@xmath11 flavor composition and assuming a single - component @xmath15 flux over the entire energy range of interest",
    ", it was shown  @xcite that the 2-year icecube data was largely consistent with the expectations from the standard model ( sm ) neutrino - nucleon interactions .",
    "this provides a unique test of the sm involving the highest energy neutrinos ever observed in nature and any statistically significant deviations in future might call for a non - standard explanation . in fact , several new physics scenarios have been envisaged in this context , e.g.  early - decay of a massive long - lived particle  @xcite , decay  @xcite or annihilation  @xcite of a heavy dark matter , secret neutrino interactions involving a light mediator  @xcite , lepto - quark resonance  @xcite , decay of massive neutrinos to light ones over cosmological distances  @xcite , mirror neutrinos  @xcite , superluminal neutrinos  @xcite , color - octet neutrinos  @xcite , extra - dimensions  @xcite and tev - scale gravity  @xcite . even within the sm framework ,",
    "various other possibilities have been considered , e.g. the glashow resonance in @xmath16  @xcite and @xmath17 scattering  @xcite , and interactions of nuclei with matter  @xcite .",
    "if the data continues to be consistent with the sm predictions , one can put useful constraints on some of the exotic scenarios mentioned above  @xcite , which are otherwise difficult to probe in low - energy laboratory experiments .",
    "nevertheless , it was pointed out in  @xcite that the ( 1:1:1)@xmath11 flux seems to give a mild deficit in the observed muon tracks at high energies , where the atmospheric background is anyway expected to be small .",
    "this was independently confirmed in a dedicated likelihood analysis  @xcite .",
    "although the ( 1:1:1)@xmath11 flavor composition is still allowed at the 90% c.l .",
    "@xcite and a potential muon deficit could be attributed to experimental effects such as track mis - identification , it is worth scrutinizing other possible flavor ratios at source . in this paper",
    ", we critically examine the possible physical flavor and spectral compositions of the uhe neutrino flux in light of the 3-year icecube data . after confirming the mild ` muon deficit problem ' with the standard ( 1:2:0)@xmath10 flux , we consider other well - motivated sources with ( 1:0:0)@xmath18 , ( 0:1:0)@xmath10 and ( 1:1:0)@xmath10 flavor compositions and show that it is possible to mitigate the muon deficit problem , if it really exists , with the ( 1:0:0)@xmath18 flux , whereas the ( 0:1:0)@xmath10 and ( 1:1:0)@xmath10 fluxes further aggravate the problem . in any case , once one recognizes the existence of any of these additional sources along with the standard ( 1:2:0)@xmath10 source , it is rather _ natural _ to consider at least a _ two - component _ flux , instead of a single component over the entire energy range of interest .",
    "moreover , we show that such a two - component flux could also offer a simple explanation of the apparent energy gap between 400 tev1 pev , apart from addressing the muon deficit problem , all _ within _ the sm framework , i.e.  without invoking any new physics .",

    "similarly , a low - energy cut - off for the second component could be due to its production mechanism , e.g. from a @xmath3 collision which has a sharp @xmath111-resonance .",
    "similarly , the potential muon deficit problem can be adressed by taking the first component of the two - component flux to be ( 1:0:0)@xmath10 .",

    "in particular , any further information on the number of events in the glashow resonance bin will be crucial to pin down the flavor composition in the higher - energy bins .",
    "in the two - component example considered above , the ( 1:2:0)@xmath10 flux in the higher energy range predicts less number of electron neutrino events in the glashow resonance bin , and therefore , is preferred by the current data over a ( 1:0:0)@xmath10 flux .",
    "in addition , a more accurate measurement of the energy spectrum can distinguish our two - component hypothesis from other possible explanations of the gap , e.g. due to secret neutrino interactions  @xcite or due to the line - of - sight interactions of crs emitted by blazars with background photons  @xcite .",

    "in particular , if the apparent energy gap between 400 tev and 1 pev deposited energy bins becomes statistically significant , our two - component hypothesis might provide a simple explanation for this observation , with important consequences for the identification of the underlying astrophysical sources .",
    "given that so much is unknown about the dynamics of the uhe neutrino sources and that a precise knowledge of their flavor composition is crucial for a reliable understanding of the underlying astrophysical processes as well as for the particle physics interpretation , it is desirable to determine the flavor composition from experiment , as more data is collected at current and future large - volume neutrino detectors . finally , we hope that the future experimental analyses will seriously consider the possibility of such a two - component flux .",

    "we look forward to the formal publication of the new dataset with more information on the events as well as on the atmospheric background , to be able to update our spectral and flavor analysis accordingly in a future work .",

    "<S> understanding the spectral and flavor composition of the astrophysical neutrino flux responsible for the recently observed ultra - high energy events at icecube is of great importance for both astrophysics and particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a statistical likelihood analysis to the 3-year icecube data and derive the allowed range of the spectral index and flux normalization for various well - motivated physical flavor compositions at source . while most of the existing analyses so far assume the flavor composition of the neutrinos at an astrophysical source to be ( 1:2:0 ) , it seems rather unnatural to assume only one type of source , once we recognize the possibility of at least two physical sources . </S>",
    "<S> bearing this in mind , we entertain the possibility of a two - component source for the analysis of icecube data . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that our two component hypothesis explains some key features of the data better than a single - component scenario , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e _ it addresses the apparent energy gap between 400 tev to about 1 pev and easily accommodates the observed track to shower ratio . </S>",
    "<S> given the extreme importance of the flavor composition for the correct interpretation of the underlying astrophysical processes as well as for the ramification for particle physics , this two - component flux should be tested as more data is accumulated . </S>"
