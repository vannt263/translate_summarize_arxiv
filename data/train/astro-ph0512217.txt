    "while the nature of dark energy is a complete mystery , there are several candidates for dark matter particles .",
    "of which , the most popular candidate is the stable supersymmetric neutralino with mass on the order of gev to tev , which can explain the observed dark matter mass density today .",
    "although very weak , it is expected that dark matter particles may interact with the usual matter via scattering , interact with themselves , and/or annihilate into gamma rays , positrons , and neutrinos .",
    "the direct detection of particle dark matter is , therefore , under intensive and extensive efforts of both physicists and astronomers @xcite .",
    "high - energy photons from annihilation of dark matter particles provide indirect means to probe the properties of dark matter .",
    "annihilation signatures , especially gamma rays , have been searched for in regions where the dark matter density is expected to be high , as annihilation rate is proportional to the density squared , @xmath4 .",
    "an obvious site is the central region of our galaxy .",
    "strong gamma - ray emission has been detected toward the galactic center over a wide energy range , and the nature and origin of this emission have been investigated by many researchers @xcite . although both the spectrum and angular distribution of gamma rays from the galactic center are well observed , it is still quite difficult to distinguish a dark matter component from the other possibilities such as emission from `` ordinary '' astrophysical objects ; even future gamma - ray detectors and telescopes do not have sufficient resolution to remove all the other sources from the galactic central image .",
    "another possibility is the extragalactic background light , the cosmic gamma - ray background ( cgb ) , which has been measured in a wide energy range @xcite .",
    "it has been speculated that some fraction of the cgb may originate from annihilation of dark matter particles in halos distributed over cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "the dark matter contribution to the cgb depends on the nature of dark matter particles , such as their mass and annihilation cross section , as well as the cosmological evolution of dark matter halos .",
    "while it is likely that the dominant part of the cgb spectrum in the gev region , detected by the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) @xcite , comes from unresolved blazars , i.e. , beamed population of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , annihilating dark matter might give large contribution at some specific energy range .",

    "possible candidates for this case include the supersymmetric neutralino , as well as the kaluza - klein dark matter predicted by theories of universal extra - dimension ( e.g. , @xcite ) and heavy relic neutrinos @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the origin of the cgb in mev region is much less understood than in gev region .",
    "the soft gamma - ray spectrum in 120 mev can not fully be attributed to either agn or type ia supernovae or a combination of the two @xcite ; thus , annihilation of dark matter particles is one of the most viable explanations for the cgb in mev region , provided that the dark matter mass is around 20 mev @xcite .",
    "such a light dark matter particle was originally introduced to explain the origin of the 511 kev emission line from the galactic center @xcite , detected by the international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( integral ) @xcite , which is otherwise difficult to explain .",
    "therefore , the mev dark matter is an attractive candidate that satisfies the observational constraints from both the galactic center and the cgb ,  mev throughout this paper , one can easily extend our calculations to arbitrary dark matter masses . ] while its particle physics motivation is less clear than for the neutralinos .",
    "dark matter annihilation may be a viable explanation for the cgb , but how do we know for sure that the cgb does come from annihilation ? what would be a smoking - gun signature for the annihilation signal ?",
    "we argue that _ anisotropy _ of the cgb may provide a smoking - gun signature .",
    "although the cgb is isotropic at the leading order , anisotropy should also exist if the cgb originates from cosmological halos .",
    "the future gamma - ray detectors with an enhanced sensitivity and angular resolution , such as the gamma ray large area space telescope ( glast ) or the advanced compton telescope ( act ) , should be able to see such anisotropy .",
    "we believe that the cgb anisotropy is going to be the key to discriminating between the dark matter annihilation signal and the other sources .    in this paper",
    ", we develop the formalism to analytically calculate the angular power spectrum of the cgb from dark matter annihilation .",
    "we calculate the angular power spectrum in gev region ( for supersymmetric neutralinos ) as well as in mev region ( for mev dark matter ) .",
    "we then discuss the detectability of cgb anisotropy in gev region by glast and in mev region by act , showing that the predicted anisotropy can be easily measured by 1-year operation of these experiments .",

    "since the gamma - ray emissivity from dark matter annihilation is proportional to the density squared , @xmath4 , the cgb intensity ( the number of photons per unit area , time , solid angle , and energy range ) toward the direction @xmath5 can be generally expressed as @xmath6e_\\gamma , r ) ,    \\label{eq : intensity}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the observed gamma - ray energy , @xmath8 is the redshift , @xmath9 is the comoving distance out to an object at @xmath8 , @xmath10 is some function of gamma - ray energy and @xmath9 that is given below , and @xmath11 is the overdensity at @xmath12 compared to the average dark matter mass density , @xmath13 , given by @xmath14 because the dominant contribution comes from the dark matter halos , @xmath11 is always much larger than unity . note that we label time by @xmath9 ( or redshift @xmath8 used interchangeably ) , and space by @xmath15 .",

    "( [ eq : general expression of intensity ] ) and ( [ eq : emissivity ] ) , and recalling that @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we obtain @xmath10 as @xmath30    by taking the ensemble average of eq .",

    "@xcite and @xmath43 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we should comment on the boundary of the mass integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intensity multiplier ] ) . as the mass function falls exponentially toward large masses , the integral converges at high mass end",
    "; however , it actually diverges at low mass end , although only very weakly .",
    "this raises some questions regarding robustness of theoretical predictions for the mean intensity of cgb from dark matter annihilation .",
    "what determines the minimum mass , @xmath44 ? in principle , one should integrate the mass function down to the free - streaming scale or the jeans mass of dark matter particles , below which there is no fluctuation in dark matter .",
    "for both neutralinos and mev dark matter , the minimum mass is roughly on the order of the mass of earth @xcite , while it can vary by orders of magnitude depending on the precise value of the dark matter mass .",
    "( one should recalculate @xmath44 as a function of the dark matter mass @xcite or any other particle physics parameters that affect the strength of interactions . ) when gamma rays emerge from annihilation without any other interactions of the products of annihilation with the materials within halos  i.e. , dark matter annihilating directly into photons , photons emerge as the final state radiation of annihilation ( also known as the internal bremsstrahlung ) , or decay of the products of annihilation into gamma rays ( e.g. , decay of @xmath45 produced by annihilation of neutralinos ) , one should use the minimum mass set by the free - streaming mass or the jeans mass of dark matter particles . on the other hand ,",
    "when gamma rays are produced predominantly by interactions between the products of annihilation and the materials within halos after annihilation , e.g. , dark matter annihilation producing intermediate particles such as positrons which , in turn , annihilate with electrons _ in the halo _ to produce gamma rays , the minimum mass would be set by the jeans mass of _ baryons _ , which is on the order of @xmath46 or larger @xcite .",
    "therefore , which minimum mass to use depends on what radiative processes one assumes for the production of gamma rays per annihilation .",
    "this issue is further complicated by the fact that not all dark matter halos would actually survive during the formation of large - scale structure .",
    "halos above the baryonic jeans mass would survive without any problems ; however , a significant fraction of halos with very small free - streaming masses , say @xmath47 , would have been tidally disrupted shortly after their formation and might not be able to contribute to the cgb .",
    "the critical mass above which the tidal disruption due to hierarchical clustering becomes inefficient is difficult to calculate accurately at present @xcite .",
    "( note that we are not concerned about the tidal disruption of these micro halos within larger halos  this would be a subject of the effect of substructures within halos , and we shall come back to this point in sec .",
    "[ sub : substructure of dark matter halos ] . here",
    ", we are mostly concerned about the tidal disruption of the extragalactic micro halos that are outside of larger halos . )",
    "generally , the dependence of cgb anisotropy on the minimum mass is expected to be not very strong , when the amplitude of anisotropy is divided by the mean intensity , @xmath48 , the dependence approximately canceling out in the numerator and denominator . to take into account the uncertainty in our understanding of the minimum mass contributing to the cgb , we explore two cases , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , i.e. , 12 orders of magnitude variation in the minimum mass .",
    "the clumping factor depends on @xmath8 through the halo mass function @xcite and the concentration of density profiles @xcite . to compute the linear power spectrum that is necessary for the halo mass function",
    ", we adopt the fitting formula in ref .",
    "the concentration parameter as a function of halo mass and redshift determines how steeply dark matter distributes in a halo ; we use the result given in ref .",
    "@xcite . using these ingredients ,",
    "we compute the clumping factor for a given density profile . for the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile @xcite ( @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is defined by @xmath53 for small radii ) , we obtain @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 . for steeper profiles such as the one with @xmath58 suggested by the other simulations @xcite , the clumping factor increases by about an order of magnitude .",
    "more recent simulations suggest that @xmath52 depends on radii and could be anywhere between 1 and 1.5 in the inner region @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for analytical approaches ) .",
    "again , while the mean intensity depends strongly on @xmath52 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , anisotropy ( divided by the mean intensity ) is expected to be less sensitive to the precise value of @xmath52 . for definiteness",
    "we adopt @xmath59 throughout the paper .",
    "incidentally , it is practically useful to use the nfw profile , as many quantities used in the formalism can be calculated analytically for this profile .",
    "one also needs to specify the particle physics parts involved in the function @xmath10  the dark matter mass , averaged cross section @xmath60 , and gamma - ray spectrum per annihilation .",
    "we assume that the dark matter particle contributing to the cgb totally accounts for the observed dark matter mass density , @xmath61 . in many cases ,",
    "the annihilation cross section is closely related to @xmath62 , as it determines the abundance of dark matter particles having survived pair annihilation in the early universe .. see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details . ] for both the supersymmetric neutralino and mev dark matter , the canonical value of the cross section is @xmath63 @xmath64 s@xmath20 , while a wide range of parameter space is still allowed mev @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath24 turns out to be less than 20  mev , then a smaller cross section may be preferred . ]",
    "; in addition , we assume it to be independent of the relative velocity . once again",
    ", the value of the annihilation cross section actually does not affect the cgb anisotropy , when it is normalized by the mean intensity , @xmath65 .",
    "( the cancellation is exact when it is independent of velocity . ) thus , although a larger cross section is favored in order to make the dark matter contribution to the cgb mean intensity more significant , the prediction for the amplitude of anisotropy ( divided by the mean intensity ) is robust regardless of the precise value of the cross section .",
    "while the energy spectrum of gamma - ray emission per annihilation contains rich information about the nature of dark matter particles , we do not pay much attention to the detailed shape of the spectrum , but rather simply split the spectrum into two parts : mev and gev regions , the former representing mev dark matter , and the latter representing neutralinos .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation , as each contribution gives continuum gamma - ray emission that is roughly constant over relevant energy regions . for neutralinos",
    "we use a simple parameterization , @xmath66 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the kaluza - klein dark matter particle might also contribute to the cgb in gev region ; their contribution may be calculated using an appropriate gamma - ray energy spectrum per annihilation .",
    "for mev dark matter we consider the internal bremsstrahlung ( @xmath67 ) as the source of continuum emission , which gives @xmath68 [ 1 + ( s^\\prime / s)^2 ] / ( \\pi e_\\gamma)$ ] , where @xmath69 is the fine structure constant , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "we shall ignore the 511 kev line emission , as its contribution must be subdominant compared with the agn contribution @xcite .",
    "gev , while that in mev region is the prediction for mev dark matter particles with @xmath72 mev . as for the normalization",
    ", we have used @xmath73 @xmath64 s@xmath20 , and extra `` boost '' factors have been multiplied to match the observational data . for details of the boost factors , see the last paragraph of sec .",
    "ii.,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cgb_spect ] , we show the average cgb intensity calculated with the ingredients given above for the neutralino ( @xmath74 gev ) and mev dark matter ( @xmath72 mev ) .",
    "we also show the observational data obtained by the imaging compton telescope ( comptel ) @xcite and egret @xcite .",
    "the predicted spectra have been multiplied by a factor of @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) for the neutralino , and 10 ( 1.6 ) for the mev dark matter , respectively , assuming @xmath77 , to reasonably match the observational data .",
    "these boost factors may originate from dark matter substructures within halos or the cross section potentially larger than the value adopted here .",
    "note that the 20 mev dark matter with @xmath78 ( which is not very far away from the actual free - streaming mass of 20 mev dark matter particles ) can already account for most of the observed cgb without the need for a substantial boost due to substructures ( the boost factor is only 1.6 ) , which agrees with a more detailed analysis performed in ref .",
    "in this section , we develop the formalism to analytically calculate the angular power spectrum of cgb anisotropy due to annihilation of dark matter particles .",
    "we note that this formalism is quite general , and with some modification , it can be applied to other situations including gamma rays from ordinary astrophysical objects .",
    "we expand the deviation of cgb intensity from its mean value into the spherical harmonics coefficients , @xmath79 , @xmath80 note that we have defined @xmath79 as a dimensionless quantity ; thus , @xmath79 represents the amplitude of anisotropy divided by the mean intensity . using the orthonormal relation of @xmath81 , one obtains @xmath82 where @xmath83 and the energy index in the function @xmath10 has been suppressed to simplify the notation .",

    "<S> high - energy photons from pair annihilation of dark matter particles contribute to the cosmic gamma - ray background ( cgb ) observed in a wide energy range . </S>",
    "<S> since dark matter particles are weakly interacting , annihilation can happen only in high density regions such as dark matter halos . </S>",
    "<S> the precise shape of the energy spectrum of cgb depends on the nature of dark matter particles  their mass and annihilation cross section , as well as the cosmological evolution of dark matter halos . in order to discriminate between the signals from dark matter annihilation and other astrophysical sources , </S>",
    "<S> however , the information from the energy spectrum of cgb may not be sufficient . </S>",
    "<S> we show that dark matter annihilation not only contributes to the mean cgb intensity , but also produces a characteristic _ anisotropy _ , which provides a powerful tool for testing the origins of the observed cgb . </S>",
    "<S> we develop the formalism based on a halo model approach to analytically calculate the three - dimensional power spectrum of dark matter clumping , which determines the power spectrum of annihilation signals . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the expected sensitivity of future gamma - ray detectors such as the gamma ray large area space telescope ( glast ) should allow us to measure the angular power spectrum of cgb anisotropy , if dark matter particles are supersymmetric neutralinos and they account for most of the observed mean intensity of cgb in gev region . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if dark matter has a relatively small mass , on the order of 20 mev , and accounts for most of the cgb in mev region , then the future advanced compton telescope ( act ) should be able to measure the angular power spectrum in mev region . as the intensity of photons from annihilation is proportional to the density squared , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the predicted shape of the angular power spectrum of gamma rays from dark matter annihilation is different from that due to other astrophysical sources such as blazars and supernovae , whose intensity is linearly proportional to density . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the angular power spectrum of the cgb provides a `` smoking - gun '' signature of gamma rays from dark matter annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> while the mean cgb intensity expected from dark matter halos with smooth density profiles is smaller than observed , the dark matter substructure within halos may provide the origin of additional `` boost '' factors for the annihilation signal . </S>",
    "<S> our formalism can be used for any other radiation processes that involve collision of particles . </S>"
