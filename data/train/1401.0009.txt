    "while the similar ordering is expected in lao bilayer , our dft calculations with @xmath15 up to 4 ev and @xmath43 up to @xmath44 did not find any magnetic ordering .",

    "figure [ fig : magne ] shows the magnetic order parameters and the gap amplitude for ( a ) sio and ( b ) lao . as expected from the smaller critical @xmath15 for the mott transition in sio , the critical @xmath15 for an af ordering is also small , @xmath45 ev . in fig .",

    ", there appears a finite window for an af ti where the gapless edge states and bulk magnetic ordering ( time - reversal symmetry breaking ) coexist as discussed later .",
    "this comes from the fact that the spin component perpendicular to the [ 111 ] plane is conserved in our @xmath18 electron model @xcite , and therefore lao bilayer consists of two copies of chern insulators with the opposite chern number .",
