    "slug tests are a common tool in hydrogeology for hydraulic characterization of aquifers because they are quick , obviate the need for waste water disposal , require less equipment , and are not as labor intensive as pumping tests .",
    "fundamentally , they involve instantaneous ( step ) perturbation of fluid pressure in an interval followed by continuous monitoring of the pressure change as it dissipates by fluid flow through the aquifer .",
    "this is typically achieved by either dropping a slug mass into a well @xcite or pneumatically pressurizing the water column in a well @xcite , a configuration referred to as a single well test .",
    "several mathematical models are available in the hydrogeology literature for analyzing confined @xcite and unconfined @xcite aquifer slug test data under the darcian flow regime .",
    "consideration of slug tests under non - darcian flow regimes may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "slug tests have the advantage of only involving limited contact with and minimal disposal of effluent formation water . as such ,",
    "they have found wide application for characterizing heterogeneous formations at contaminated sites @xcite and for investigating flow in fractured rock @xcite .",
    "however , the small volumes of water involved impose a physical limit on the volume of the formation interrogated during tests @xcite because the resulting pressure perturbations often do not propagate far enough to be measurable in observation wells . as a result",
    ", hydraulic parameters estimated from single well slug - test data can only be associated with the formation volume within the immediate vicinity of the source well @xcite .",
    "cross - hole ( or multi - well ) slug tests are less common but have been applied to interrogate relatively large formation volumes in what has come to be known as hydraulic tomography @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite used pneumatic cross - hole injection tests to hydraulically characterized a fractured unsaturated rock formation with dimensions of @xmath0  @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite presented evidence of measurable pressure responses in observation wells several meters from the source well .",
    "@xcite reported cross - hole slug tests conducted in fractured rock , where they collected data in observations wells at radial distances 30 to about 120  m from the source well , and observed maximum peak amplitudes ranging from 5 to 20  cm .",
    "this demonstrated empirically that slug test pressure perturbations can propagate over relatively large distances beyond the immediate vicinity of the source well , albeit for fractured rocks , which have high hydraulic diffusivities .",
    "@xcite attempted to intensively apply cross - hole slug tests to obtained a detailed image of confined aquifer heterogeneity .",
    "they used the model of @xcite to estimate aquifer hydraulic conductivity , specific storage and anisotropy .",
    "cross - hole slug tests in unconfined aquifers , neglecting wellbore inertial effects , have been reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for source - to - observation well distances not exceeding 15 m.    recently @xcite and @xcite analysed synthetic cross - hole slug test data using a model for over - damped observation well responses . the need , therefore , still exists to analyse field data and characterize high permeability heterogeneous unconfined aquifers using cross - hole slug tests where source and observation well inertial effects may not be neglected .",
    "@xcite developed a slug test model for unconfined aquifers using the linearised kinematic condition of @xcite at the water - table , and accounting for inertial effects of the source well .",
    "they analysed data from single - well tests performed in a shallow unconfined aquifer .",
    "this work extends the application of the model of @xcite to multi - well tests and to response data collected in observation wells .",
    "the data analysed were collected at multiple vertical intervals in an observation well about 4 m from the source well , which itself was perturbed at multiple intervals .",
    "the model and data are used to estimate hydraulic conductivity , specific storage , and specific yield",
    ". the sensitivity of predicted model behaviour to these parameters is also analysed . in the following ,",
    "the mathematical model is presented , the multi - level multi - well tests are described , and data analysed . the work concludes with an analysis of the sensitivity coefficients for the hydraulic and well characteristic parameters .",
    "schematic of a typical cross - hole slug test set - up for an unconfined aquifer . for the tests reported herein , the source and observation intervals were isolated with a multi chamber well not a multi - packer system.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]",
    "@xcite developed a model for formation and source well response to slug tests performed in unconfined aquifers using the linearised kinematic condition at the water - table .",
    "the model allows for estimation of specific yield in addition to hydraulic conductivity and specific storage .",
    "the model also accounts for source - well wellbore storage and inertial effects .",
    "wellbore storage in the source well is treated in the manner of @xcite .",
    "a schematic of the conceptual model used to derive the semi - analytical solution is shown in figure [ fig : slugschematic ] . whereas the solution of @xcite was obtained for and applied to source wells , here a more complete solution is presented that applies to observation wells . the complete aquifer response for both source and observation wells",
