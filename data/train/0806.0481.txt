    "study of direct photon and dilepton spectra emanating from hot and dense hadronic matter formed in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions is a field of considerable current interest .",
    "electromagnetic probes have been proposed to be one of the most promising tools to characterize the initial state of the collisions  @xcite . because of the very nature of their interactions with the constituents of the system they tend to leave the system without much change of their energy and momentum .",
    "in fact , photons ( dilepton as well ) can be used to determine the initial temperature , or equivalently the equilibration time .",
    "these are related to the final multiplicity of the produced hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions . by comparing the initial temperature with the transition temperature from lattice qcd",
    ", one can infer whether quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is formed or not .",
    "there are various sources of photons from relativistic heavy ion collisions : ( i ) thermal photons from qgp and hot hadronic matter ( hhm ) , ( ii ) hard photons ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "( iii ) photons from decay of @xmath1 .",
    "hard photon yield can be reliably calculated using perturbative quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the last class of photon emission processes is the jet conversion mechanism  @xcite which occurs when a high energy jet interacts with the medium constituents via annihilation and compton processes .",
    "it might be noted that this phenomenon ( for compton process ) has been illustrated quite some time ago  @xcite in the context of estimating photons from equilibrating scenario where , because of the larger cross - section , gluons equilibrate among themselves providing a heat bath to the incoming quark - jet .",
    "a comparison of the non - equilibrium photons ( equivalent to jet - conversion ) with the direct photons ( thermal ) shows that this contribution remains dominant for photons with @xmath2 upto 6 gev .",
    "however , while evaluating jet - photon the assumption made in ref .",
    "@xcite that the largest contribution to photons corresponds to @xmath3 which amounts to saying that the annihilating quark ( anti - quark ) directly converts to a photon .",
    "moreover , before annihilating the quark jet loses energy in the scattering with the particles in the thermal bath .",
    "the partonic energy loss due to collisional processes was revisited in  @xcite and its importance was demonstrated in the context of rhic in@xcite .",
    "the measurements of non - photonic single electron data  @xcite show larger suppression than expected .",
    "these electrons mainly come from heavy quark decay where the radiative energy loss is suppressed due to dead cone effect .",
    "this observation has led to re - thinking the importance of collisional energy loss both for heavy as well as light quarks .    in this work",
    "we calculate the photon yield from jet - plasma interaction using exact expression for photon rate .",
    "we also include the jet energy loss in the jet - plasma interaction . in view of the controversy over the relative importance between @xmath4 and @xmath5 processes",
    "we restrict ourselves to the collisional energy loss only . in the photon production rate ( from jet - plasma interaction )",
    "one of the collision partners is in equilibrium and the other ( the jet ) is assumed to execute brownian motion in the heat bath consisting of quarks ( anti - quarks ) and gluons .",
    "furthermore , the collisional energy loss is dominated by small angle scattering . under such scenario the evolution of the jet phase space distribution",
    "is governed by fokker - planck ( fp ) equation where the collision integral is approximated by appropriately defined drag and diffusion coefficients .",
    "the lowest order processes for photon emission from qgp are the compton ( @xmath6 ) and annihilation ( @xmath7 ) processes .",
    "the total cross - section diverges since the differential cross - section suffers singularity at @xmath8 and/or @xmath9 .",
    "these singularities have to be shielded by thermal effects in order to obtain infrared safe calculations .",
    "it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the intermediate quark acquires a thermal mass in the medium , whereas the hard thermal loop ( htl ) approach of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that very soft modes are suppressed in a medium leading to a natural cut - off @xmath10 .",
    "we , from the very beginning , assume the singularities can be shielded by the introduction of thermal masses for the participating partons .",
    "the differential cross - sections for compton and annihilation processes are taken from ref .",
