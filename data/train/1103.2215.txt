    "trust is an important abstraction used in diverse scenarios including e - commerce  @xcite , distributed and peer - to - peer systems  @xcite and computational clouds  @xcite .",
    "since these systems are open and large , participants ( agents ) of the system are often required to interact with others with whom there are few or no shared past interactions . to assess the risk of such interactions and to determine whether an unknown agent is worthy of engagement",
    ", these systems usually offer some trust - management mechanisms to facilitate decision support .",
    "if a trustor has sufficient direct experience with an agent , the agent s future performance can be reliably predicted  @xcite .",
    "however , in large - scale environments , the amount of available direct experience is often insufficient or even non - existent . in such circumstances ,",
    "prediction is often based on trustor s `` indirect experience ''  opinions obtained from other agents that determine the target agent s reputation  @xcite .",
    "simple aggregations , like a seller s ranking on ebay , rely on access to global information , like the history of the agent s behavior . alternatively , _ transitive trust models _ ( or web of trust models )  @xcite build chains of trust relationships between the trustor and the target agent .",
    "the basic idea being that if @xmath0 trusts @xmath1 and @xmath1 trusts @xmath2 , then @xmath0 can derive its trust in @xmath2 using @xmath1 s referral on @xmath2 and @xmath0 s trust in @xmath1",
    ". in a distributed system with many agents and many interactions , constructing such chains requires substantial computational and communication effort .",
    "additionally , if the referral trust is inaccurate , the transitive trust may be erroneous .",
    "furthermore , trust may not be transitive between different contexts : @xmath0 may trust @xmath1 in a certain context ( e.g. , serving good food ) , but not necessarily to recommend other agents ( a `` meta''-context , or the referral context )  @xcite .",
    "all the above mentioned approaches aggregate _ the same kind of information _  agents impressions about past transactions , i.e. behavioral history .",
    "however , many systems provide a vast context for each transaction , including its type , category , or participants profile .",
    "we were curious to see how accurately one could predict trust using such contextual information .",
    "the primary objective of this work was thus not to outperform existing trust models using the same information .",
    "in contrast , we explore a complementing alternative that can enhance the existing models  or to replace them , when the vast information they require is not available ( for instance , as a bootstrapping mechanism ) .",
    "the contribution of this work is a trust model that estimates target agents trust using stereotypes learned by the assessor from its own interactions with other agents having similar profile .",
    "our work is partly inspired by  @xcite that study the relation between the reputation of a company and its employees : the company s reputation can be modeled as an aggregate of employees reputations and it can suggest a prior estimate of an employee s reputation . in stereotrust , agents form stereotypes by aggregating information from the context of the transaction , or the profiles of their interaction partners .",
    "example stereotypes are `` programmers working for google are more skilled than the average '' or `` people living in good neighborhoods are richer than the others '' . to build stereotypes , an agent has to group other agents ( `` programmers working for google '' or `` people living in good neighborhoods '' ) .",
    "these groups do not have to be mutually exclusive .",
    "then , when facing a new agent , in order to estimate the new agent s trust , the trustor uses groups to which the new agent belongs to .    in case",
    "an agent does not have enough past experience to form stereotypes , we propose to construct a stereotypes sharing overlay network ( sson ) , which allows the newcomers to get stereotypes from established agents . in section  [ sec : share ] we discuss how a newcomer can then use the stereotypes without completely trusting the agents who produced them .",
    "stereotrust assumes that the trustor is able to determine the profile of the target agent , and that the extracted information is accurate enough to distinguish between honest and dishonest agents .",
    "the profile of an agent is a construct that represents all the information a trustor can gather .",
    "an underlying assumption is that interaction with an agent about which no information is available is rare .",
    "for instance , when interacting with people , the profile may be constructed from the agent s facebook profile .",
    "similarly , a profile of a company may be constructed from its record in companies registry or yellow pages . generally , an agent s profile is hard to forge as it is maintained by a third party ( e.g. , historical transaction information of an ebay seller ) . in case",
    "the profile is manipulated ( e.g. , in a decentralized environment ) , the trustor may resort to distributed security protection mechanisms or even to human operators to extract the correct information .",
    "note that stereotrust will likely determine as useless the parts of the profile which can be easily forged and do not have sufficient discriminating power .",
    "while having its own weaknesses and limitations , we think that stereotrust is interesting both academically and in practice .",
    "academically , its novelty lies in emulating a human behavior of modeling trust by stereotypes for the first guess about a stranger . in practice , as , first , stereotrust may be applicable in scenarios in which information used by traditional trust models is not available , noisy , inaccurate or tampered .",
    "second , stereotrust provides personalized recommendations based on a trustor s own experience ( in contrast to the `` average '' experience used in reputation - based approaches ) .",
    "third , if the global information used by a standard trust models is available , it can be seamlessly integrated to our model in order to enhance the prediction ( thus , the term `` stereo '' in the model s name is a double entendre ) .",
    "the stereotypes are improved by dividing the original group into `` honest '' and `` dishonest '' subgroups based on available data about past behavior of agents .",
    "our experiments show that such a dichotomy based refinement , called d - stereotrust , significantly improves the accuracy .",
    "since stereotrust defines groups in a generic way , it may be used in very different kinds of applications ; even within the same application , different agents may have their own personal , locally defined groups . also , the notion of trust itself can be easily adapted to different contexts . in this paper",
    ", we use the widely - adopted definition of trust as the trustor s subjective probability that a target agent will perform a particular action  @xcite .    as an example application ,",
    "consider judging the quality of product reviews from a web site such as epinions.com .",
    "in such a community , users write reviews for products , structured into different categories ( e.g. , books , cars , music ) .",
    "these reviews are later ranked by other users .",
    "normally , each reviewer has some categories in which she is an `` expert '' ( like jazz albums for a jazz fan ) .",
    "the reviewer is more likely to provide high quality reviews for products in these familiar categories . of course",
    ", users may also write reviews for products from other categories , but their quality might be inferior , because of , e.g. , insufficient background knowledge .",
    "`` mastery '' can be correlated between categories .",
    "for instance , audiophiles ( people interested in high - quality music reproduction ) usually know how to appreciate music ; thus , if they decide to review a jazz album , the review is more likely to be in - depth .",
    "the correlation might also be negative , as one may not expect an insightful review of a jazz album from , e.g. , a game boy reviewer .",
    "when facing an unrated review of a jazz album by an unknown contributor , we can use the information on the contributor s past categories ( game - boy fan or an audiophile ? ) and our stereotypes ( `` noisy '' gamers vs. insightful audiophiles ) to estimate the quality of the review .",
    "we use epinions.com data to evaluate stereotrust ( section  [ sec : evaluation ] ) : we demonstrate that taking into account reviewers interests provides a good estimation of the quality of the review .    consider a very different kind of application",
    " a peer - to - peer storage system .",
    "if a peer wants to store a new block of data , it needs to choose a suitable replication partner .",
    "the suitability of a partner peer depends on the likelihood that the peer will be available when the data needs to be retrieved ( which may depend on its geographic location , time - zone difference , etc . ) ; the response time to access the data ( which may depend on agreements and infrastructure between internet service providers ) ; and many other factors .",
    "existing systems usually use a multi - criteria optimization model , and thus need substantial knowledge about the specific peer in question  for instance , its online availability pattern , end - to - end latency and bandwidth .",
    "applying stereotrust can provide an alternative systems design , where a peer in , say tokyo , can think  `` my past experiences tell me that peers in beijing and hong kong have more common online time with me compared with peers in london and new york .",
    "likewise , peers in new york and hong kong with a specific ip prefix provide reliable and fast connections , while the others do nt . ''",
    "based on such information , if the peer has to choose between a partner in hong kong or in london , the peer can make the first guess that a peer in hong kong is likely to be its best bet , without needing to know the history of the specific peers in question . a `` mixed '' data placement strategy that uses available historical information and stereotypes is expected to result in even better performance .",
    "it is worth noting that we are not claiming that it necessarily provides the best possible system design , but merely that it opens the opportunity for alternative designs .",
    "we have in fact devised such stereotrust guided data placement strategy for p2p backup systems , resulting in several desirable properties compared to other placement strategies @xcite .",
    "the core of our contribution is the basic stereotrust model ( section  [ basicmodel ] ) and d - stereotrust , the dichotomy based enhanced model using historical information ( section  [ sec : enhencedmodel ] ) .",
    "we also discuss how to select features to form stereotypes ( section  [ preliminary ] ) .",
    "feature preprocessing can help to form discriminating stereotypes , and thus to improve the accuracy of the trust assessment .",
    "when the trustor does not have sufficient past transactions to form stereotypes , we propose to construct an overlay network to share stereotypes among agents to help inexperienced agents bootstrap the system ( section  [ sec : share ] ) .",
    "an experimental evaluation using a real - world ( epinions.com ) and a synthetic dataset ( section  [ sec : evaluation ] ) shows that stereotypes provide an adequate `` first guess ''  and when coupled with some historical data ( d - stereotrust ) , the resulting trust estimates are more accurate than the estimates provided by the standard trust models .",
    "intuitively , past mutual interactions are the most accurate source to predict agent s future behavior @xcite , but such an approach is unsuitable in large - scale distributed systems where an agent commonly has to assess a target agent with whom it has no past interactions .    instead of using only local experience ,",
    "many approaches derive the trust from target agent s reputation  information aggregated from other agents .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite derive trust from paths of trust relationships starting at the trustor ( the asking agent ) , passing through other agents and finishing at the target agent ( the transitive trust model ) .",
    "however , the transitive trust model has several drawbacks , such as handling wrong recommendations , efficiently updating trust in a dynamic system , or efficiently establishing a trust path in a large - scale system .",
    "eigentrust @xcite is a reputation system developed for p2p networks .",
    "its design goals are self - policing , anonymity , no profit for newcomers , minimal overhead and robustness to malicious coalitions of peers .",
    "eigentrust also assumes transitivity of trust .",
    "the peers perform a distributed calculation to determine the eigenvector of the trust matrix .",
    "the main drawback of eigentrust is that it relies on some pre - trusted peers , which are supposed to be trusted by all peers .",
    "this assumption is not always true in the real world .",
    "first , these pre - trusted peers become points of vulnerability for attacks .",
    "second , even if these pre - trusted peers can defend the attacks , there are no mechanisms to guarantee that they will be always trustworthy .",
    "additionally , eigentrust ( and some other reputation systems like @xcite ) is designed based on distributed hash tables ( dhts ) , thus imposing system design complexity and deployment overheads .",
    "in contrast , our proposed model does not rely on any specific network structure for trust management .",
    "@xcite proposed a trust system using groups .",
    "a group is formed based on a particular interest criterion ; group s members must follow a set of rules .",
    "the approach assumes that the leader of each group creates the group and controls the membership .",
    "the trust is calculated by an aggregative version of eigentrust , called eigen group trust . in eigen group trust ,",
    "all the transactions rely on the group leaders , who are assumed to be trusted and always available .",
    "this approach requires certain special entities ( i.e. , group leaders ) to coordinate the system , thus may suffer from scalability issue , while stereotrust has no such restrictions .",
    "regret  @xcite combines direct experience with social dimension of agents , that also includes so - called system reputation .",
    "system reputation is based on previous experience with other agents from the same _ institution_. unlike stereotrust s stereotypes , regret s institutions exist outside the system , thus each agent can be assigned to an institution with certainty .",
    "regret also assumes that each agent belongs to a single institution .",
    "blade @xcite derives trustworthiness of an unknown agent based on the feedback collected from other agents .",
    "this model treats agent s properties ( i.e. , certain aspects of the trustworthiness ) and other agents feedback as random variables . by establishing a correlation between the feedback and the target agent s properties using bayesian learning approach ,",
    "the trustor is able to infer the feedback s subjective evaluation function to derive certain property of the unknown target agent .",
    "the related works reviewed so far mainly rely on direct experience and/or indirect experience with the target agent to derive trust .",
    "in contrast , stereotrust uses another kind of information  stereotypes learned from the trustor s own interactions with _ other _ agents having similar profiles .",
    "so stereotrust provides a complementing alternative that can enhance the existing models , particularly when the vast information they require is not available .",
    "while using stereotypes for user modeling and decision making was suggested previously @xcite , to the best of our knowledge the conference version of this paper  @xcite is the first concrete , formal computational trust model that uses stereotypes .",
    "several other papers on similar lines have been published since then , demonstrating the potential of using stereotypes for assessing trust .",
    "@xcite used stereotypes to address the cold - start issue .",
    "the trustor constructs stereotypes relying on m5 model tree learning algorithm @xcite .",
    "that is , stereotype construction is treated as a classification problem ( i.e. , learning association between features and the expected probability of a good outcome ) , so no explicit groups are built .",
    "in contrast , our approach forms and maintains explicit groups and infers the corresponding stereotypes based on aggregated behaviors of the group members .",
    "this makes the derived stereotypes easy to be interpreted by the real users .",
    "similarly to our stereotype - sharing overlay network , in their work , new trustors can request stereotypes from the experienced ones , and then combine these stereotypes with the target agent s reputation ( if any ) using subjective logic @xcite .",
    "although similar , our approach has several advantages : ( 1 ) as a basic trust model , stereotrust uses the ( well adapted ) beta distribution to derive stereotypes and trust , thus the resulting decision is easy to be interpreted ; ( 2 ) the work @xcite shares agents local stereotypes heuristically ( e.g. , no discussion on how stereotype providers are selected ) while stereotrust offers a more sophisticated sharing mechanism by maintaining a dedicated overlay network for exchanging , combining , and updating stereotypes ; ( 3 ) stereotrust is applicable in practice as demonstrated in real - world dataset ( epinions.com ) based evaluation ( see section [ sec : evaluation ] ) presented in this paper , as well as in other diverse applications and settings in which we have applied stereotype to derive trust @xcite .",
    "@xcite considers the problem of identifying useful features to construct stereotypes .",
    "three feature sources are discussed : ( i ) from the social network , i.e. , relationships between agents are features ; ( ii ) from agents competence over time .",
    "the target agent s accumulated experience in certain tasks can be viewed as features .",
    "an example stereotype may be _ if an agent performed task t more than 100 times , he is considered experienced ( trustworthy)_. ( iii ) from interactions , e.g. , features of both interaction parties . for instance , the trustor with certain features is positively or negatively biased towards the target agent with other features .",
    "this work provided a comprehensive summary of feature sources ( for stereotype formation ) from social relationships among agents , but the authors did not apply these features to any concrete application scenarios for validation .",
    "such works identifying suitable features for building stereotypes complement stereotrust s abstract computational trust model leveraging on said stereotypes .    the stereotypes stereotrust uses can be also regarded as a generalization of various hand - crafted indirect trust or reputation metrics  alternatively , these metrics can be interpreted as complex stereotypes ( in contrast to our stereotypes , some of these metrics also involve other agents opinions ) . for instance , two of the metrics proposed by  @xcite : the transaction price and the savviness of participants ( measured as the focus of a participant on a particular category ) are analogous to our stereotypes .",
    "stereotrust also has parallels to the ranking mechanisms used in web search engines .",
    "the usage of group information is analogous to using the content of the web pages to rank them .",
    "transitive trust models resemble `` pure '' pagerank @xcite , that uses only links between pages . similarly to web search , where using both content and links together gives better results , we derive an enhanced method ( d - stereotrust ) , that uses both groups and ( limited ) trust transitivity .",
    "we refer to a participant in the system as an agent .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the set of all agents in the system ; and by @xmath4 the set of agents known to agent @xmath5 .",
    "an agent can provide services for other agents .",
    "a transaction in the system happens when an agent accepts another agent s service . to indicate the quality of a service ,",
    "an agent can rank the transaction . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the result is binary , i.e. , successful or unsuccessful .",
    "@xmath6 denotes the set of transactions between service provision agent @xmath7 and service consumption agent @xmath8 and @xmath9 denotes the number of such transactions .",
    "we assume that each agent @xmath10 is characterized by a feature vector @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath12 the set of values for each feature @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "features may be qualitative ( gender , country of residence ) , or quantitative ( salary , age , number of children ) .",
    "we assume that the domain of the feature vectors is the same for all agents .",
    "transactions performed by agents are also characterized by similarly defined feature vectors .      in stereotrust ,",
    "a group is a community of agents who show some common properties or behave similarly in certain aspects . because of the common properties shared by all the members of a group , the group can act as a collective entity to represent its member agents ( to a certain extent ) . for instance",
    ", people may consider a programmer working in a well - known software company as skilled , even if they do not personally know the person .",
    "people trust the company based on the quality of produced software ; thus they also trust the programmers who create the software . on the other hand",
    ", a company employing skilled ( i.e. , trusted ) programmers can release high - quality products , and thus gain high reputation . such interplay between the group s and its members reputation is the basis of our work .",
    "we derive the trust of an agent according to the trusts of its corresponding groups .",
    "groups are defined subjectively by the trustor @xmath5 .",
    "a group @xmath15 is a set of agents .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 the set of all groups defined by @xmath5 .",
    "based on @xmath5 s previous experience , stereotypes , and any other information , @xmath5 formulates grouping function @xmath17 \\to [ 0,1]$ ] , that , for each group @xmath15 , map agent @xmath18 to the probability that @xmath18 is the member of this group .",
    "thus , in the most general model , a group is a fuzzy set of agents . if @xmath19 , it is certain that @xmath18 is member of @xmath15 ( @xmath20 ) ; if @xmath21 , it is certain that @xmath18 does not belong to @xmath15 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "such a group definition makes the agent grouping flexible and personalizable , in contrast to the rigid notion of group membership in regret  @xcite .",
    "the premise of our work is that the trustworthiness of a group ( i.e. , stereotypes ) reflects the trustworthiness of the group members .",
    "members of a group should behave consistently  ideally , a group should be discriminating , i.e. contain only either honest ( the ones act honestly in transactions ) , or dishonest agents .",
    "thus , the key question is : what features of agents can be used to form such discriminating groups ?    among many possible approaches to find discriminating features ( such as the gini index @xcite , or the chi - square test @xcite ) we use the information gain  @xcite , which is measured by _",
    "entropy _ as the criterion to select the features .",
    "the resulting decision model is easy to interpret by the users of the system .",
    "however , other , more complex approaches to derive decision criteria can be also used , such as decision trees or learning discriminant analysis ( used in our recent work  @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the categorization is binary ( i.e. , an agent is honest or dishonest ) .",
    "we denote the proportion of honest and dishonest agents by @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "then the entropy of the set of agents that trustor @xmath8 has interacted with is calculated as : @xmath26    entropy is used to characterize the ( im)purity of a collection of examples . from eq . [",
    "eq : entropy ] we can see that the entropy will have the minimum value of 0 when all agents belong to one class ( i.e. , either all honest or all dishonest ) and the maximum value of @xmath27 when agents are evenly distributed across the two classes .",
    "using entropy , we calculate information gain of every feature to determine the best ones .    for each feature @xmath12",
    ", we partition the set of agents @xmath4 into subsets @xmath28 based on the values of the feature the agents have ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the subsets @xmath28 are disjoint and they cover @xmath30 .",
    "the information gain of feature @xmath31 is then calculated by :    @xmath32    the information gain of a feature measures expected reduction in entropy by considering this feature .",
    "clearly , the higher the information gain , the lower the corresponding entropy .",
    "we can then select features based on their information gains .",
    "several methods can be used .",
    "for instance , we can first rank the features by information gain ( descending order ) and choose the first @xmath33 features , depending on the specific applications ; or we can set a threshold @xmath34 and select the features whose information gain is higher than @xmath34 .",
    "we demonstrate in evaluation ( see section [ sec : evaluation ] ) how such feature selection scheme is applied in epinions dataset to improve trust prediction accuracy .    in some cases , a trustor may also want to develop new stereotypes that are associated with combined features .",
    "for instance , consider that the agents profile has many fields , including country , gender , income , etc .",
    "a trustor already has two stereotypes , say , on people from a country @xmath0 ( with the feature vector @xmath35 $ ] , where @xmath36 denotes any value of the corresponding feature ) and on women ( @xmath37 $ ] ) .",
    "when the trustor wants to develop a new stereotype on women from country @xmath0 , it needs to combine the feature vectors .",
    "a combined feature vector contains all the values of qualitative features from vectors to be combined .",
    "thus , in our example , the combined vector is @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "note that contradictory feature vectors can not be combined , for instance @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the trustor can transform other , non - qualitative features using standard machine learning techniques , such as discriminant analysis .      while our approach is generic , in order to instantiate it , we use a computational trust model based on the beta distribution .",
    "a computational trust model models the complex notion of trust by a variable ( binary , discrete , continuous , etc . ) .",
    "we assume that trust indicates the probability that an agent will perform a particular , expected action during a transaction  @xcite .",
    "thus , the agent s trust rating is a real number from range @xmath41 $ ] , where 0 indicates that the agent is absolutely untrustworthy and 1 indicates that the agent is absolutely trustworthy .",
    "the beta distribution is commonly used to model uncertainty about probability @xmath42 of a random event , including agent s reputation  @xcite .",
    "we model a series of transactions between a pair of agents as observations of independent bernoulli trials . in each trial , the success probability @xmath42 is modeled by the beta distribution with parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( we start with @xmath45 , that translate into complete uncertainty about the distribution of the parameter , modeled by the uniform distribution : @xmath46 ) . after observing @xmath47 successes in @xmath48 trials ,",
    "the posterior density of @xmath42 is @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "we choose beta distribution because the resulting decision is easy to be interpreted by the system users , and is an already popular choice for modeling and interpreting trust .",
    "the trust function between _ entities _",
    "@xmath50 ( an individual agent or a group ) is defined based on the beta distribution :    entity @xmath51 evaluates entity @xmath52 . from the viewpoint of @xmath51 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 represent , respectively , the number of successful transactions and unsuccessful transactions between @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "trust function @xmath57 mapping trust rating @xmath42 ( @xmath58 ) to its probability is defined by :    @xmath59    the expected value of the trust function is equal to : @xmath60",
    "the basic stereotrust trust model only uses the trustor s local stereotypes to derive another agent s trustworthiness and hence it works without the target agent s behavioral history that is typically required by conventional trust models . consider a scenario where a service requestor ( a trustor agent ) @xmath8 encounters a potential service provider @xmath7 with whom @xmath8 had no prior experience .",
    "we assume that @xmath8 can obtain some features about @xmath7 , such as @xmath7 s interests , location , age etc .",
    "@xmath5 combines its previous experience with such information to form groups that help to derive @xmath61 s trustworthiness .",
    "stereotrust starts by forming stereotypes , based on the trustor s historic information . in the first step ,",
    "appropriate features are selected and/or combined ( section  [ sec : featureselection ] ) . using the processed features , stereotrust groups agents accordingly .",
    "note that stereotrust considers only groups for which the membership is certain from @xmath5 s perspective ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "we denote these groups by @xmath63 such that @xmath62 ( for the sake of simplifying the notation , we will use @xmath64 in place of @xmath65 when the context is clear ) .",
    "the trust between @xmath5 and each of these groups @xmath64 is derived based on past interactions with agents that belong to @xmath64 with certainty .",

    "then , @xmath5 counts the total number of successful @xmath68 transactions with @xmath64 as a sum of the numbers of successful transactions with @xmath64 s members : @xmath69 .",

    "obviously , the higher the number of transactions regarding one group , the more likely is @xmath8 to interact with agents of this group , so this group contributes more to represent @xmath7 s trust from viewpoint of @xmath8 .",

    ", we propose to let agents share their stereotypes .",
    "inexperienced agents can use such shared stereotypes to complement their limited local knowledge .",
    "the agents are , moreover , pragmatic about the external ( shared by someone else ) stereotypes : the influence of an external stereotype is weighted by its accuracy observed in previous interactions .",

    "_ for instance , an agent itself may have few interactions with agents from a specific group , and hence its stereotypes about that group may not be comprehensive to make good estimate about the group members behavior .",
    "thus , even if the agent has no malicious intent , if it shares with others a stereotype which is in fact wrong or inconclusive , that will be detrimental to the system .    to address this issue , we need to determine which local stereotypes are accurate by investigating the minimum number of transactions @xmath121 needed by a trustor to be confident ( with some pre - determined confidence level , e.g. , @xmath122 ) about the collective behavior of the group .",
    "we treat a group of agents as an entity , so we model the numbers of successful and unsuccessful transactions between the trustor and the group as the aggregated numbers of successful and unsuccessful transactions between trustor and members of that group . using statistical methods , such as the chernoff bound @xcite",

    "consequently , if a trustor has at least @xmath121 transactions with members of one group , it is confident about its current stereotype towards that group .",

    "agents deliberately sharing misleading information , or agents with very different perspectives may be dealt with using conventional mechanisms , e.g. , using a blacklist or a whitelist ; next , we describe a strategy based on a whitelist .          to evaluate the trustworthiness of a target agent @xmath7 , an inexperienced trustor @xmath8 who has few or no local knowledge needs to request other agents stereotypes .",
    "@xmath8 only requests the agents who are trustworthy in terms of providing correct stereotypes . that is , each agent @xmath123 in the system maintains a _ trusted stereotype provider _ list @xmath124 which stores the agents that this agent trusts in terms of providing correct local knowledge .",
    "the stereotype sharing overlay network ( sson ) is constructed by connecting agents and their trusted stereotype providers .",

    "the trust score is determined and updated by the stereotype requester ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) after it evaluates correctness / usefulness of the information provided by the provider . note",
    "that since an agent may have very subjective perspective , even if the provider provides accurate stereotype , it may not be correct / useful to @xmath8 . in this case",
    ", the provider will be issued a low score although it is honest . in our work",

    "after each request , the trustor updates the trust score of the corresponding stereotype provider according to the accuracy of the reported stereotypes ; the accuracy is assessed from the trustor s perspective ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : ssonupdate ] ) . to collect correct stereotypes , @xmath8 request the top - k stereotype providers with highest trust scores in the _ trusted stereotype provider _ list , thus limiting communication overhead .    notice that sson is constructed to promote correct stereotypes sharing to help inexperienced agents estimate trustworthiness of an unknown service provider , but it is not used to discover trustworthy transaction partner because agents who provide high quality service may not necessarily report correct information about other agents ( and vice versa ) @xcite . in the scenario that the agents who provide correct stereotypes also act honestly in a transaction , sson can be used to help promote successful transactions ( i.e. , select reliable agents who have high trust scores as the service providers ) .",
    "however , the goal of this work is to design mechanisms to estimate trustworthiness of an unknown service provider ( i.e. , no historical information is available ) , so discussion on relying sson to derive agent s trust like traditional trust mechanisms ( e.g. , feedback aggregation @xcite , web of trust @xcite , etc . )",
    "is out of the scope of this paper .      after collecting other agents stereotypes ,",
    "we discuss how trustor @xmath5 combines these external stereotypes to derive the trust of the unknown target agent @xmath61 .",
    "we adopt a simple weight based strategy to combine the stereotypes in order to compute the final trust score for @xmath61 .",

    "we denote the trust scores of the stereotype providers by @xmath128 .",
    "the weight of stereotype provided by agent @xmath123 is calculated as @xmath129 .",
    "weighted stereotypes can be combined by the same methods as discussed in section  [ basicmodel ] : the sof or the sop methods .",
    "the quality of stereotypes provided by different agents may vary .",
    "some agents may maliciously provide fake information ; others may have different perspective on the quality of transactions .",
    "an agent using external stereotypes must discover such behavior and update trust scores of the stereotype providers such that inaccurate stereotypes have less impact on the final decision .",
    "the problem of deriving trust in a stereotype provider is analogous to the general problem of computational trust .",
    "@xmath5 , after observing the outcome of its transaction with @xmath61 , updates stereotype providers trust .",
    "this time , however , we define a _ recommendation transaction _ between a trustor @xmath5 and a stereotype provider @xmath130 .",
    "the recommendation transaction is successful if the observed outcome of the original transaction ( between a trustor @xmath5 and agent @xmath61 ) is the same as the outcome predicted by @xmath130 s stereotype .",
    "the trust @xmath131 in stereotype provider @xmath123 can be then derived based on the number of successful @xmath132 and unsuccessful @xmath133 _ recommendation _ transactions .",
    "@xmath131 is thus updated after each transaction .",
    "any computational trust model can be used to compute @xmath131 from @xmath132 and @xmath133 . in order to instantiate the model , similarly to the basic stereotrust model ,",
    "we use the beta distribution ( section  [ sec : trustfunction ] ) .",
    "@xmath131 is the expected value of the distribution , computed as @xmath134 .",
    "so far , we have presented the basic stereotrust model , its dichotomy based enhancement , as well as a overlay network supporting efficient stereotype information sharing .",
    "the rationale for the stereotrust approach is to determine an alternative and complementary mechanism to compute trust even in the absence of ( global ) information that is likely to be unavailable under some circumstances , and instead using some other class of information ( stereotypes ) which can be established by local interactions .",
    "since stereotrust utilizes information theory / machine learning to conduct feature selection and feature combination to form stereotypes , it is worth mentioning that the trustor periodically re - trains the model to more accurately derive trustworthiness of the target agent .",
    "several methods may be applied to update the model , for instance , the trustor may refine stereotypes after every @xmath135 new transactions ; or the trustor only updates the model when the latest trust prediction is unsuccessful .",
    "we will introduce and evaluate different update strategies in the experimental evaluation section ( section [ sec : evaluation ] ) .    similarly to other models like eigentrust  @xcite , transitive trust  @xcite , blade  @xcite , regret  @xcite and travos  @xcite , stereotrust is explicitly not designed to cope with agent s dynamic behavior .",
    "however , from the perspective of behavior science  @xcite , as well as being supported by recent works that use contextual information to predict user behavior in various information systems  @xcite , we believe that an agent s behavior change in the transactions is correlated with and can be inferred ( to certain extent ) by the associated contextual information ( e.g. , by considering the dynamic trust @xcite ) . for instance , in an online auction site like ebay , a seller may vary his behavior consciously or unwittingly in selling different items ( e.g. , he may be careful when selling expensive goods , but imprudent with cheap ones ) . by selecting appropriate features from the contextual information ( e.g. , the item s price ) ,",
    "stereotrust is able to construct stereotypes that partially model the target agents implicit dynamic behaviors . specifically ,",
    "when an agent changes its behavior , some of the associated features may also vary accordingly .",
    "such dynamism is observed by the trustor who will then adjust its local stereotypes to adapt to the target agent s dynamic behavior ( we will show performance of such a learning based adaptive update strategy in the next section ) .",
    "since this work focuses on `` cold - start '' problem of trust assessment , and handing dynamism is a problem in its own right , we leave as a future work a more detailed discussion on addressing behavior changes .",
    "in this section , we conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of proposed stereotrust models .",

    "[ sec : realdata ] presents the results on the epinions.com dataset ; [ sec : syndata ] presents the results on the synthetic dataset .",
    "when comparing stereotrust with other algorithms and approaches , we consider two factors : the _ accuracy of prediction _ that compares the result of the algorithm with some ground truth ; and the _ coverage _ , the fraction of the population that can be evaluated by the trustor , given trustor s limited knowledge .    we compare stereotrust with the following algorithms .",

    "each    opinion of a friend is weighted with the friend s global reputation .    to get a broad view of the target agent s performance ,",
    "the trustor    will continue asking its friends friends , and so on , until the    difference of the two trust values derived in the two subsequent    iterations is smaller than a predefined threshold .",
    "pre - trusted agents    ( with high global reputation ) are used in this model . _ transitive trust ( web of trust ) _ : :    this model @xcite is based on transitive trust chains",

    "the average mean absolute errors for honest agents , dishonest agents and all agents are , respectively , 0.1277 , 0.1211 and 0.1242 . by comparing with the results without sson ( tab .",
    "[ tab : syndatamae ] ) , we notice that even if the trustor does not have sufficient local knowledge , by requesting other agents stereotypes , it is still able to reasonably estimate the trustworthiness of the potential interaction partner . in order to further validate the usefulness of the sson , we let the 10 selected inexperienced trustors collect third party stereotypes randomly for trust estimation ( i.e. , sson is not applied ) . on the average ,",
    "sson lowers mae in comparison with random selection by around 13.22% .",
    "this result demonstrates that sson evidently improves the performance of stereotrust when trustor s local knowledge is insufficient .",
    "d - stereotrust has the highest prediction accuracy ( the smallest mae ) at the cost of incomplete coverage ( 95.5% , table  [ tab : syndatamae ] ) .",
    "d - stereotrust requires only fragmentary third - party information , as the trustor only asks agents that are also interested in corresponding categories .",
    "consequently , d - stereotrust is robust even when up to 40% of agents are malicious .",
    "eigentrust not only has lower prediction accuracy ( the difference , albeit small , is statistically significant ) , but also requires a complex , distributed calculation , thus incurring high communication overhead .",
    "additionally , eigentrust requires some pre - trusted agents , which may not exist in reality .",
    "d - stereotrust uses both stereotypes and historic information . as the accuracy of dichotomy - only is lower",
    ", stereotypes indeed improve the prediction accuracy .",
    "other standard methods , the feedback aggregation and both variations of transitive trust models , have significantly lower prediction accuracy . moreover , the transitive trust model ( using the most reliable path ) has the lowest coverage .",
    "blade model improves prediction accuracy by learning rating providers bias .",
    "however , blade requires that the trustor must have sufficient experience with the rating providers such that the target agent s trustworthiness can be reliably inferred .",
    "this makes blade ineffective in some cases , and hence lowering its overall accuracy .",
    "although stereotrust has lower prediction accuracy than d - stereotrust , stereotrust uses only local information , and no opinions of third - parties .",
    "the key to accuracy here are the appropriate stereotypes  the more the stereotypes mirror the true honesty of the agents , the more accurate predictions stereotrust will form .",
    "we expect that in some contexts such stereotypes can be evaluated by , or formed with , an assistance of a human operator .    with sson ( table  [ tab : syndatamaesson ] )",
    ", the trustors without sufficient local knowledge can predict trust by requesting other agents stereotypes .",
    "thus , the coverage of stereotrust model becomes complete . since other agents may provide fake stereotypes maliciously",
    ", some of the collected stereotypes may not derive accurate trust .",
    "however , by updating trust scores of stereotype providers based on past accuracy of their reported stereotypes , the final aggregated stereotype information is still able to reasonably predict trustworthiness of the unknown agents .",
    "we consider the problem of predicting trustworthiness of an unknown agent in a large - scale distributed setting .",
    "traditional approaches to this problem derive unknown agent s trust essentially by combining trust of third parties to the agent with the trustor s trust of these third parties ; or simply by aggregating third parties feedbacks about the unknown agent .",
    "in contrast , stereotrust uses different _ kind _ of information : that of _ semantic _ similarity of the unknown agent to other agents that the trustor personally knows . in stereotrust",
    ", a trustor builds stereotypes that aggregate and summarize the experience it had with different kinds of agents .",
    "the criteria by which the stereotypes are constructed are very flexible .",
    "for instance , stereotypes can be based on information from agents personal profiles , or the class of transactions they make .",
    "so one basic assumption of stereotrust is that such profile information is correctly available .",
    "we believe this is a reasonable assumption because it is rare to interact with an agent about which absolutely no information is available . facing a possible transaction with an unknown agent , the trustor estimates its trust by cumulating the experience from the stereotypes to which the unknown agent conforms .",
    "the stereotypes are based on the local perspective and local information of the trustor , and , therefore , are naturally suited for large - scale systems ; personalized for each trustor ; and less susceptible to false or unsuitable information from third parties .",
    "when some third parties opinions about an agent are available , we propose an enhancement ( d - stereotrust ) , which creates a `` good '' and a `` bad '' subgroup inside each stereotype .",
    "the trustor assigns each one of its previous transaction partners to one of these groups based on its personal experience with the partner ( e.g. , the ratio of failed transactions ) .",
    "then , the trustor uses the aggregated third parties opinions about the unknown agent to determine how similar is the agent to the `` good '' and the `` bad '' subgroup .",
    "third parties opinions are a small subset of information used by traditional mechanisms ( such as feedback aggregation or eigentrust - type algorithms ) . according to our experiments , by combining stereotypes with the partial historic information , d - stereotrust predicts the agent s behavior more accurately than eigentrust and feedback aggregation .",
    "stereotrust can be not only personalized for a particular trustor , but also for a particular type of interactions ( classified by groups ) .",
    "we are currently working on such extensions of stereotrust , as well as exploring possible concrete applications , including a p2p storage system .    while our technique is novel in the context of evaluating trust  and provides a new paradigm of using stereotypes for trust calculation instead of using feedbacks or a web of trust ",
    "it bears resemblance with collaborative filtering techniques @xcite .",
    "the primary difference is that stereotrust uses only local information in a decentralized system .",
    "however , the similarities also mean that while our work proposes a new paradigm to determine trust , the methodology we use is not out of the blue .",
    "also , we anticipate that sophisticated collaborative filtering as well as machine learning techniques can be adopted to further improve stereotrust s performance .",
    "some nascent attempts in this direction include our recent works @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : discussion ] , stereotrust is not explicitly designed to handle the scenario where the agents behavior may change over time . however , by studying relevant contextual information for stereotype formation , such a problem can be partially addressed . as part of future work",
    ", we intend to work on incorporating various dynamic approaches ( such as learning agents behavior pattern ) to the model .                  c.  burnett , timothy  j. norman , and k.  sycara .",
