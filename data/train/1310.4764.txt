    "quenched invariance principles and heat kernel bounds for random walks on infinite percolation clusters and among i.i.d .",
    "random conductances in @xmath0 were proved during the last two decades ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the proofs of these results strongly rely on the i.i.d structure of the models and some stochastic domination with respect to super - critical bernoulli percolation .    many important models in probability theory and in statistical mechanics , in particular , models which come from real world phenomena , exhibit long range correlations and offer an incentive to create new tools capable of handling models with dependent structures . in recent years interest arose in understanding such systems , both in specific models such as random interlacements , vacant set of random interlacements and the gaussian free field , as well as in general systems , see for example @xcite . in the context of invariance principle with long range correlations one should emphasize the results of biskup @xcite and andres , deuschel , and slowik @xcite , that prove a quenched invariance principle for random walk in ergodic random conductances under some moment assumptions and ellipticity . in this paper",
    "we prove a quenched invariance principle for random walks on percolation clusters ( i.e. , in the non - elliptic situation ) in the axiomatic framework of drewitz , rth , and sapozhnikov @xcite .",
    "this framework encompasses percolation models with strong correlations , including random interlacements , vacant set of random interlacements , and level sets of the gaussian free field .",
    "the main novelty of our proof is a new isoperimetric inequality for correlated percolation models , see theorem  [ thm : isoperimetric ] .",
    "we should emphasize that existing methods for proving isoperimetric inequalities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) only apply to models which allow for comparison with bernoulli percolation after a certain coarsening procedure .",
    "a common feature of the three examples above is that they can not be effectively compared with bernoulli percolation on _ any _ scale .",
    "thus , the existing methods for proving isoperimetric inequalities do not apply .",

    "such approach is quite restrictive and does not apply to models which can not be compared with bernoulli percolation on any scale , such as , for example , random interlacements .",
    "our method is more robust and requires only minimal assumptions on the decay of probabilities of some events .",
    "we will now comment on the proof of theorem  [ thm : isoperimetric ] . as in all the proofs of isoperimetric inequalities for subsets of the infinite cluster of bernoulli percolation",
    ", we set up a proper coarsening of @xmath20 and then translate the given isoperimetric problem for large subsets of @xmath20 into an isoperimetric problem on the coarsened lattice .",
    "nevertheless , both the coarsening and the analysis of the coarsened lattice are very different from the ones used in existing approaches . the major difficulties , as already discussed , come from the presence of long - range correlations and the fact that the models can not in general be compared with bernoulli percolation , which rules out possibilities of using any peierls - type argument .",
    "we partition the lattice @xmath0 into boxes @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and subdivide the set of all boxes into _ good _ ( very likely as @xmath115 ) and _ bad_. in the restriction of @xmath20 to each of the good boxes , it is possible to identify uniquely a connected component of _ largest volume _ , which we call _ special _ , see lemma  [ l : fromg0tozd](a ) .",
    "moreover , for any pair of adjacent good boxes , their special connected components are connected locally , see lemma  [ l : fromg0tozd](b ) .",
    "we emphasize that a good box may contain several connected components of large diameter , and in principle a connected component with the largest diameter may be different from the special component .",
    "this is the key difference of the coarsening procedure that we use from the ones used in the study of bernoulli percolation .",
    "the main reason for doing this is that a box is good if two local events occur , one of which is increasing ( there exists a large in volume connected component of @xmath20 in the box ) and the other decreasing ( the cardinality of @xmath20 in the box is not so big ) , see definitions  [ def : axu ] and [ def : bux ] .",
    "using to control correlations between such monotone events , we set up two multi - scale renormalizations with scales @xmath116 ( one for increasing and one for decreasing events ) to identify with high probability a well structured subset of good boxes .",
    "we call a @xmath116-box @xmath117-good if all the @xmath118-subboxes of this box , except for the ones contained in the union of at most two boxes of side length @xmath119 , are @xmath120-good .",
    "( here @xmath121 is a sequence of positive integers growing to infinity , but much slower than @xmath122 . )",
    "every @xmath116-box is @xmath117-good with overwhelming probability .",
    "we are interested in the set of ( @xmath123-)good boxes which are contained in @xmath117-good boxes for all @xmath109 .",
    "this set is obtained by a perforation of @xmath0 on multiple levels , and therefore has a well described structure .",
    "indeed , from each @xmath117-good box , we delete two boxes of size length @xmath119 , from each of the remaining @xmath118-boxes ( all of which are @xmath120-good ) , we delete two boxes of side length @xmath124 , and so on until we reach the level @xmath123 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath125 , then the set of all deleted boxes ( the complement of the good set ) has a small volume .",
    "we should mention that such coarsening and renormalization have already been used before in @xcite to study models with long - range correlations satisfying assumption .",
    "we need to further sparsen the obtained set of good boxes to make sure that it has good connectivity properties .",
    "this is done by a `` deterministic '' multi - level perforation of @xmath0 , where from each @xmath117-good box , we delete yet at most one box of side length @xmath119 depending on the location of two already deleted boxes of side length @xmath119 .",
    "for example , if two boxes of side length @xmath119 are deleted near an edge of an @xmath116-box , then we delete another box of side length @xmath119 at the edge , see figures  [ fig : mathcalg ] and [ fig : gconstruction ] . during this discussion , we call the resulting ( connected ) set of good boxes _ fat_. the fat set is not only connected in the lattice of @xmath126-boxes , but also its restriction to any lower dimensional sublattice @xmath127 is connected , where @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 are pairwise orthogonal unit vectors , see proposition  [ prop : gproperties ] .",
    "this property is crucially used in the proof of an isoperimetric inequality for subsets of fat set , but we will come to that .",
    "if the renormalization scales @xmath116 are growing fast enough , then the restriction of the fat set to the box @xmath131 serves as a coarsening of the largest connected component @xmath96 , which also ensures uniqueness of @xmath96 .",
    "we would like to reduce the isoperimetric problem for large subsets of @xmath96 to an isoperimetric inequality for large subsets of good boxes of the fat set .",
    "the main obstruction here is that our coarsening allows to identify a subset of @xmath96 of large volume ( union of special components of good boxes ) , but the remaining parts of @xmath96 may contain long dangling ends with bad isoperimetric properties .",
    "we resolve this issue by two requirements on the set of configurations that we consider .",
    "first of all , since we do not have any control of how @xmath20 looks like in the `` deleted '' boxes of side length @xmath119 , we should at least make sure that each deleted region is not too big in comparison with @xmath132 , the minimal size of sets which we consider .",
    "we require that on a level @xmath133 of renormalization such that @xmath134 ( see ) , all the @xmath135-boxes intersecting @xmath136 are @xmath133-good , i.e. , the biggest box that we `` delete '' has side length at most @xmath137 .",
    "second , to get a partial control of connectivities in the dangling ends , we require that any @xmath138 such that @xmath139 are connected in @xmath140 . configurations satisfying these assumptions form an event of high probability , and next we consider only configurations from this event .    given @xmath105 such that @xmath141",
    ", we identify a subset @xmath142 of good boxes in the fat set for which @xmath94 intersects the special connected component .",
    "if @xmath143 is small , then we show that the boundary of @xmath94 is very large ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "the reason for this is that while most of the vertices @xmath15 of @xmath94 are not in special connected components of good boxes in the fat set , each of them is within distance at most @xmath135 from the fat set ( all @xmath135-boxes in @xmath136 are @xmath133-good ) , and thus from @xmath145 .",
    "the weak connectivity assumption then makes sure that there is an edge of @xmath93 in @xmath140 , see lemma  [ l : isopmain ] . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath143 is large , then we prove that it satisfies an isoperimetric inequality in the graph of good boxes , see lemma  [ l : isopbaldg ] . noting that for any pair of good boxes from the boundary of @xmath142 , their special connected components are locally connected , one of the special components intersects @xmath94 and the other does not , we obtain a lower bound on @xmath146 in terms of the size of the boundary of @xmath142 , see .",
    "it remains to prove the isoperimetric inequality for large subsets @xmath147 of good boxes of the fat set .",
    "we consider the set @xmath148 of disjoint @xmath135-boxes such that at least half of @xmath126-boxes contained in it are from @xmath147 , see . again , if @xmath149 , then the boundary of @xmath147 is at least @xmath150 .",
    "the interesting case is when @xmath151 . by the isoperimetric inequality in the lattice of @xmath135-boxes , the boundary of @xmath148",
    "has size @xmath152 .",
    "we , roughly speaking , estimate the boundary of @xmath147 from below by the part of its boundary restricted to ( disjoint ) @xmath135-boxes from the boundary of @xmath148 and show that the restrictions to all the boxes are of size @xmath153 .",
    "thus the boundary of @xmath147 contains @xmath154 disjoint pieces of size @xmath155 , and we are done .    to be precise , for any pair of adjacent @xmath135-boxes from the boundary of @xmath148 , one box has large intersection with @xmath147 , and the other small . therefore , the intersection of @xmath147 with a box of side length @xmath156 containing both @xmath135-boxes is comparable in size with its complement in this @xmath156-box . we show that the boundary of @xmath147 in any such @xmath156-box is at least @xmath155 , see lemma  [ l : isopa ] . for this",
    "we prove a stronger statement that the restriction of @xmath147 to @xmath157-dimensional subboxes ( @xmath129 ) of a given @xmath156-box which contain a non - trivial ( bounded away from @xmath123 and @xmath21 ) density of vertices from @xmath147 satisfies an isoperimetric inequality in those subboxes , i.e. , its boundary in the graph of good boxes in the @xmath157-dimensional subbox has size @xmath158 , see lemma  [ l : isopaj ] .",
    "the last statement is proved by induction on @xmath157 .    in the case",
    "@xmath159 , we first reduce the problem to _ connected _ sets with complement consisting of large connected components , see . then by using the precise construction of the fat set ( from each @xmath117-good box we delete at most @xmath160 boxes of side length @xmath119 ) , we show that the boundary of the set in the graph of good boxes has almost the same size as the boundary of the set in @xmath161 , i.e. , the part of the boundary of the set which touches some `` deleted '' boxes is small , see . in the case",
    "@xmath162 , we use a dimension reduction argument .",
    "we first consider @xmath163-dimensional subcubes ( slices ) of a given @xmath157-dimensional subcube which are stacked along one particular coordinate direction .",
    "if there is a positive fraction of slices which have large intersections with @xmath147 and its complement , then we use induction assumption for these slices .",
    "otherwise , we conclude that there are two large disjoint subsets of slices , those that contain many vertices from @xmath147 and very few from its complement , and those that contain few vertices from @xmath147 and many from its complement ( overcrowded and undercrowded slices ) .",
    "we then consider two - dimensional slices that intersect all these @xmath163-dimensional slices , see figure  [ fig : slices ] .",
    "most of them will have large intersection with @xmath147 as well as with its complement .",
    "we conclude by using the isoperimetric inequality in each of these two dimensional slices ( case @xmath159 ) .",
    "it is well known that classical supercritical bernoulli percolation satisfies all the requirements  and  .",
