    "the evolution of life shows an overall trend towards an increase in size and complexity@xcite .",

    "the study of the origins of form have a long tradition in biology@xcite .",
    "initiated by turing@xcite and rashevsky@xcite , numerous attempts to formalize a mathematical description of pattern formation have been made . as a result , spatial instabilities were proposed as a powerful rationale for the creation of spatial order , out of random fluctuations , around a homogeneous state in reaction - diffusion systems@xcite .",
    "the main feature of reaction - diffusion systems is the presence of diffusion - driven instabilities under certain parametric conditions , by which small perturbations in the system are amplified , leading to ordered spatial patterns .",
    "this family of models has been systematically studied @xcite and provides the basis for several natural mechanisms of pattern formation @xcite .",
    "the structures generated by these processes have a characteristic scale whose wavelength depends on the model parameters . along with this class of pattern - forming mechanisms , another possible class of models capable of organizing structures in space is based on cell - cell differential adhesion@xcite .",
    "such a mechanism explains the spatial re - arrangement of different cells belonging to disrupted tissues when mixed together _ in vitro_@xcite . after a transient , clusters involving cells of the same class",
    "are often observed as spatially segregated from other cell types by means of the formation of well defined boundaries or layers . in this case , the underlying mechanism explaining the origin of patterns is that of energy - minimization dynamics , similar to the one used in physics for strongly interacting particle systems .",
    "both reported mechanisms are crucial in the formation of natural self - organized structures in developing embryos @xcite , and have been connected to the early forms of multicellularity @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the early stages of the transition towards multicellularity , where the explicit connection between fitness , function and structure has been particularly difficult to elucidate and , thus , is commonly overlooked . to assess whether the structural organization of multicellular assemblies is related to differential fitness , we have developed an embodied computational model where turing - like structures appear , stemming from differential adhesion and stochastic phenotypic switching .",
    "fitness is intrinsically obtained by the introduction of a limiting nutrient and the production of a toxic waste byproduct , which respectively increase cell reproduction or death .",
    "one of the two cellular states is able to process waste at the cost of reduced proliferation .",
    "we observe that different parameter sets produce different spatial patterns , and that spatial organization can have a role in increasing fitness . finally , we discuss the implications of such results for the transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms and for the evolution of complexity .",

    "cells are discrete entities that occupy single lattice positions , have an associated state ( @xmath0 ) and move across the lattice trying to minimize their energetic potential .",
    "two states correspond to cellular phenotypes , namely white cells ( @xmath1 ) and black cells ( @xmath2 ) , while state @xmath3 represents empty space .",

    "cells are sorted by differential adhesion and can reversibly switch their phenotypes . in the ec model",
    "we include a simple metabolism by adding nutrient and toxic waste , whose concentrations drive cell proliferation and death . in the following sections we explain how cellular adhesion , phenotypic switching and metabolism are implemented in our models .",
    "the cell sorting process fundamentally occurs due to the differences in adhesion energy between states . following steinberg s differential adhesion hypothesis ( dah )",
    "we assume that the adhesion kinetics are driven by the minimization of adhesion energy between lattice sites , being cells more or less prone to remain together , and avoid or maximize contact with the external medium @xcite .",
    "the strength of interactions among different states can be defined by means of an adhesion matrix @xmath4 : @xmath5 each term @xmath6 in this matrix describes how favourable the pairwise interaction between two states is .",
    "the matrix is symmetric , i.e. @xmath7 , and has @xmath8 always . to avoid confusion",

    "this energy function , named @xmath17 , consists of two terms , one involving the cell in its original position and its neighbourhood set @xmath13 , and another involving the cell s neighbour , located in @xmath18 , with its neighbourhood @xmath19 .",
    "we then virtually swap the positions of the cell with its neighbour in @xmath18 , and calculate the energy function when swap occurs ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the energy difference is then defined as : @xmath21 when the difference is negative , a decrease in the global energy occurs and the states will swap position . instead , when @xmath22 , the larger the difference the less the swap is likely to happen , with a probability following the boltzmann distribution . if we indicate @xmath23 as the probability that our cell moves from @xmath10 to @xmath14 , it can be shown that : @xmath24 where the parameter @xmath25 is a noise factor acting as a ` temperature ' , essentially tuning the degree of determinism of our system .",
    "the boltzmann factor @xmath26 acts in such a way that if @xmath27 , the probability of swapping is @xmath28 .",
    "note that cell - cell ( and cell - medium ) interactions are local ( fig .",
    "1 ) , meaning that a cell in ( @xmath16 ) interacts only with the set @xmath13 of its eight nearest neighbours .    depending on the form of adhesion matrix , different patterns can be observed in a cell sorting system with two cell types .",
    "unless otherwise indicated , in our simulations we will apply a symmetric adhesion matrix ( see fig .",
    "sm-1 ) , where cells tend to attach preferentially to other cells in the same state , and secondarily to cells of the opposite state , while attachment with empty space is not favoured .",
    "the values of the adhesion matrix determine the structure of patterns formed by the cell sorting algorithm ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which can be perturbed by the effects of phenotypic switching .      cells can perform reversible transitions between their states @xmath1 and @xmath2 , similarly to phase variation and persistence in natural bacterial populations @xcite .",

    "it is worth mentioning that in sps the transitions between states are not dependent on any molecular cue nor any cellular memory beyond their current state .",
    "cellular metabolism is defined by two simple pathways : the ability of both @xmath1(white ) and @xmath2(black ) phenotypes to transform nutrient @xmath33 ( constantly added to the lattice ) into cellular energy @xmath34 and waste byproduct @xmath35 : @xmath36    and the unique ability of @xmath2 cells to degrade waste : @xmath37 the @xmath2 cells can allocate resources for waste degradation , at the cost of reduced energy production and therefore proliferation , following a linear trade - off ( @xmath38 ) consistent with a maximum metabolic load and shared resources for protein synthesis .",

    "the trade - off parameter @xmath52 adjusts the proportion of nutrient allotted to energy production or waste degradation in @xmath2 cells .",
    "taking into account spatial dynamics of metabolites , both kinds of cells can die either due to local excess of toxic waste or due to lack of internal energy : @xmath53 where @xmath54 indicates that the process equally affects both types of cells .",

    "we assess which type of adhesion matrix brings the related population to maximum fitness , by comparing the level of occupation of the lattice for each population . in fig .",

    "for this reason the populations related to the various adhesion matrices are equally numbered in this area -with slight differences due only to growth speed before the lattice becomes saturated- and randomly distributed over space , with no emerging structure . however , in the domain of the phase space which was uninhabited in the mf , @xmath29 and @xmath30 have such values that do not guarantee survival of cells .",
    "since cell death may occur in the ec model for this region of the phase space , here the values of the adhesion matrix do make a difference and some species get selected over others .",
    "in particular , the population with ` trabecular ' adhesion matrix prevails . moreover , we can observe that in this area cells organize in a maze structure , exhibiting division of labour within the same population .",
    "lastly , in the frontier between the two zones various populations can coexist , with a prevalence for ` onion ' adhesion matrix at high values of @xmath30 . in fig .",

    "in this paper we have shown a novel way of constructing periodic arrangements of cell types in the form of a hybrid differential adhesion and stochastic switching process .",
    "this mechanism does not rely on differential diffusion ( normally found between the activator and inhibitor species in canonical turing - type systems ) yet it can create the same kind of structures in a predictable , scalable way .",
    "the key ingredients proposed at this level include the differential adhesion hypotheses stemming from steinberg s work ( that considers the minimization dynamics associated with a set of interacting spins or adhesion strengths ) and genetic switches following markovian stochastic dynamics , which are the source of cell diversity and the basis of some adaptive responses displayed by microbial populations @xcite .",
    "the switching dynamics can modify the types of patterns expected from the purely energy - driven scenario , thus indicating that potential forms of phenotypic change can lead to additional richness of pattern forming rules .",
    "a range of spatially ordered structures is obtained displaying characteristic length scales .",
    "being both key ingredients present in extant organisms , we consider that this simple mechanism might have been used originally ( and might be reproduced in the future by synthetic means ) to create regular structures in aggregates and colonies .    in relation to pattern formation dynamics",
    ", our hybrid adhesion model offers an alternative way to generate turing patterns , which were up to now directly related with turing s rd mechanisms mediated by a diffusible molecule , or with apparently unrelated but mathematically equivalent systems such as direct contact - mediated regulation by means of which cells are affecting each other s internal rates of reactions @xcite .",
    "in fact , differently from what was proposed by babloyantz , in our hybrid da - sps model the molecules on the surface of one cell do not affect the rates of reactions in its neighbours : the phenotypic switching process occurs in any cell independently from its past and from its neighbour s state , and it is not influenced by the values of the adhesion matrix .",
    "the second relevant aspect considered is how these forming structures might be of benefit to a developing cooperative population in presence of nutrient resources and toxic agents .",
    "to do so we developed an ecology and competition model where a minimal metabolism enables positive or negative interactions between cells .",
    "cells can cooperate by metabolizing waste byproducts , yet they will suffer from decreased growth rates at higher population densities due to substrate attrition . in the ec model",
    "further pattern - forming processes can be predicted .    to further asses how structural organization can affect the fitness of cells in the habitat",
    ", we studied how cells with different adhesion matrices compete for reproduction .",
    "interestingly when many populations differing in terms of adhesion properties compete , in the region of the phase space with strong selective pressures only one of the populations survives ( fig . 7 ) .",
    "the selected specie consistently develops a periodic multicellular structure which is superior to both the unicellular and the unstructured multicellular one , suggesting that higher order properties might be of relevance to the establishment of functionality and cooperation .",
    "this simple competition model shows how minimal interaction properties pervading the metabolism of multiple species might come to play a central role in forcing the transition to collective fitness and behaviour , and sets the groundwork for explicitly evolutionary automata @xcite , where cells can optimize several genotype dimensions in order to attain more resources .",

    "<S> our results suggest that a whole space of pattern - forming rules is hosted by the combination of physical differential adhesion and the value of probabilities modulating cell phenotypic switching , showing that turing - like patterns can be obtained without resorting to reaction - diffusion processes . if the model is expanded allowing cells to proliferate and die in an environment where diffusible nutrient and toxic waste are at play , different phases are observed , characterized by regularly spaced patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the parameter space reveals that certain phases reach higher population levels than other modes of organization . a detailed exploration of the mean - field theory is also presented . </S>",
    "<S> finally we let populations of cells with different adhesion matrices compete for reproduction , showing that , in our model , structural organization can improve the fitness of a given cell population . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of these results for ecological and evolutionary models of pattern formation and the emergence of multicellularity are outlined . </S>"
