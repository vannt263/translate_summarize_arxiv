    "in @xcite two of us have introduced the generalization of the skyrmion model for the baryon . the idea was to take into account the infinite tower of the vector and axial mesons and the chiral condensate .",
    "these data are most effectively packed into the 5d holographic model for qcd @xcite in the curved geometry .",
    "the expansion of 5d gauge fields with @xmath0 gauge group into kk modes yields the whole tower of the massive mesons while the chiral condensate is encoded in the boundary condition for the bifundamental scalar .",
    "in fact the holographic qcd is just the chiral lagrangian supplemented by the tower of the massive mesons in a particular way .",
    "the conventional skyrmion is just the solitonic configuration built from the pions only however there were some attempts to include the vector mesons into the solution ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "in particular the stabilization of the skyrmion via the @xmath1 - mesons has been suggested @xcite which substitutes the skyrme term mechanism .",
    "more recently the skyrmion has been discussed in 5d model in the flat space and it was found that the vector and axial mesons strongly influence the skyrmion solution @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the generalization of the skyrmion solution with highly nontrivial role of the whole tower of the axial and vector mesons has been found .",
    "some aspects of the influence of the meson tower on the skyrmion solution have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this study is to treat the longstanding puzzle concerning the role of the qcd chiral condensate in the baryon mass generation from a new perspective using the approach developed in @xcite .",
    "this subject was triggered by the sum rule calculation of the baryon mass @xcite resulted in the following surprising formula [ form_ioffe ] m^3 = -8 ^2    amount of the baryon mass is due to the chiral condensate .",
    "however during the 30 years there was no any convincing analytical calculation which would put this formula at the firm ground .",
    "moreover the lattice calculations at the non - vanishing temperature and density added the controversy to the subject .",
    "there are lattice calculation near the phase transition temperature which shows no substantial change of the baryon mass at the transition point ( @xcite and refs therein ) .",
    "the calculation at the non - vanishing density indicates some dependence of the baryon mass at the scale where the transition to the half - skyrmion phase happens @xcite however there is no strong dependence at the restoration of the chiral symmetry point .",
    "it was suggested that the naive formula [ linear ] m_b= m_0 + ( |qq ) , where @xmath2 is condensate independent , well interpolates the physics .",
    "the similar formula has been also used in the parity - doublet model and the chiral quark - soliton model ( see @xcite for a review ) . in the latter it is assumed that the baryon consists of the three constituent quarks whose masses are related to the chiral condensate .",
    "the constituent quarks are in a topologically nontrivial pion field which provides their localization as a bound state .",
    "the total baryon mass is interpreted as the sum of constituent masses and contribution due to the shift of the negative continuum induced by the nontrivial pion field .",
    "the conventional skyrmion was identified as the instanton solution at the 4d slice of the 5d ads - like space @xcite where the holographic rg coordinate plays the role of the euclidean time direction .",
    "it can be also considered along the atiah - manton picture @xcite as the instanton trapped by the domain wall localized in the holographic coordinate .",
    "the holographic perspective suggests the proper generalization of the instanton solution which would take into account the massive mesons and chiral condensate .",
    "it is similar to the dyonic instanton solution found in @xcite in the 5d susy gauge theory .",
    "its key feature is fixing of the instanton size by the non - vanishing second charge while the mass scale is provided by the vev of the adjoint scalar .",
    "the generalization of the lambert - tong solution appropriate to our purpose is not immediate and deserves for some care @xcite . since we are working with the gauge theory at the flavor probe",
    "branes the gauge group is the product @xmath0 and the scalar lives in the bifundamental representation of the flavor gauge group instead of adjoint as in the dyonic instanton for the color group .",
    "moreover we have to take into account the nontrivial metric in 5d space which makes the analytical solution to the equation of motion quite difficult . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the solution of the dyonic instanton type exists at the particular choice of the boundary conditions .",
    "it has strong similarity with the atiyah - manton picture of the domain wall localized at the holographic coordinate .    in this paper",
    "we will do the next step within this approach and investigate the dependence of the baryon mass on the chiral condensate in the generalized skyrmion suggested in @xcite . to this aim",
    "we consider more general boundary conditions which provide more freedom in the solution .",
    "the chiral condensate was introduced via the boundary condition for the bifundamental scalar while we assume no explicit quark mass term .",
    "we shall find the numerical solution to the equations of motion and demonstrate analytically that it carries one unit of the baryon charge .",
    "its stabilization is dictated by the chiral condensate and the confinement scale .",
    "remarkably our dyonic instanton solution yields the elegant solution to the longstanding puzzle concerning the origin of the ioffe s formula ( [ form_ioffe ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the dependence of the baryon mass on the chiral condensate has two branches . at small values of the condensate",
    "the mass is condensate independent while starting at some critical value it grows according to the ioffe s formula .",
    "the analysis shows that the nature somehow dynamically selects the value of the condensate just at the intersection of two branches .",
    "therefore we obtain the natural explanation of the ioffe s formula while at small values of the condensate the baryon mass becomes almost condensate independent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ 2 ] we implement the above ideas in the simple `` hard - wall '' ads / qcd model , find nontrivial solution with unit baryon charge and study the dependence of the baryon mass on the value of the chiral condensate . section [ 3 ] is devoted to the comments on the brane picture for the solution obtained .",
    "we conclude with discussion in section [ 4 ] and give the details of numerical calculation in appendix .",
    "in order to realize the ideas mentioned in the introduction quantitatively we use the simple holographic ads / qcd model with `` hard wall '' @xcite . the bulk space is five - dimensional and has the pure @xmath3 metric . @xmath4",
    "the conformal symmetry is broken by the hard hard wall placed at @xmath5 . here and",
    "further in the paper we rescale the curvature radius of the space to 1 .",
    "the field content of the model includes two gauge fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the adjoint representation of the flavor group @xmath8 dual to the left and right quark currents , respectively .",
    "their vector and axial linear combinations will describe the full towers of vector and axial mesons in the model .",
    "another field is a bifundamental scalar @xmath9 which is dual to the quark bilinear operator @xmath10 , whose vacuum expectation value is a chiral condensate . in what follows",
    "we take @xmath11 because this leads to relatively simple expressions and should be enough to describe the main qualitative features of the baryon ( nucleon ) physics .",
    "the action reads as ( we use the notation of @xcite ) @xmath12 where the covariant derivative is @xmath13 .",
    "the constants in the action can be fixed by matching the two - point functions calculated in the holographic model to the leading terms in the sum rule approach @xcite : @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "apart of the yang - mills part of the action one needs to consider the chern - simons part , which is @xmath16 here we mark with a hat the abelian ( related to the cartan subalgebra of @xmath17 ) parts of the gauge fields .",
    "one should recall @xcite that as the abelian part of the gauge field is dual to the @xmath18 quark current , the vector combination @xmath19 is dual to the baryon number current .",
    "now we can see from ( [ cs ] ) that the source for the temporal component of the baryon current  the baryon charge  in our model is @xmath20.\\ ] ] this is identified with the difference between four - dimensional topological charges of the left and right nonabelian field configuration in the constant time slice .",
    "thus in order to describe the baryon we need to find the solution to the equations of motion of the model which has nontrivial topological charge  the instanton .",
    "this task turns out to be nontrivial even in the simple metric like ( [ metric ] ) , since the usual way of obtaining instanton solution via the bogomolny equations fails in the curved background .",
    "the thorough study of such solutions in sakai - sugimoto model was performed recently in @xcite .      in order to construct the three - dimensional spherical symmetric solution we use the ansatz similar to the witten cylindric ansatz @xcite with the holographic coordinate @xmath21 along the axis of the cylinder and the 3d radius @xmath22 in the slice of constant @xmath21 .",
    "now the model can be rewritten in terms of two - dimensional fields : @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the generators of @xmath25 obeying the commutation relation @xmath26 = - i \\epsilon^{abc } \\tau^c$ ] . in this notation",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath27 takes the convenient form @xmath28 - i \\tau^a \\left(\\delta_{ai } - \\frac{x_i x_a}{r^2 } \\right )   \\frac{1}{r } \\left[\\chi_2 \\eta_2 + \\chi_1 \\eta_1 \\right ]   \\\\",

    "the remaining @xmath18 gauge symmetry can be seen in the two - dimensional covariant derivative terms .",
    "indeed , the complex combination @xmath29 behaves as a charged scalar with respect to the abelian @xmath30 ( this was observed earlier in @xcite ) .",

    "this allows for the solution , which describes the tunneling between different vacuum states , namely the instanton .",
    "apart of that one should check that the energy ( [ energy - phases ] ) is finite at the boundaries . before proceeding with the definition of the boundary values of phases we note ,",
    "that in ( [ energy - phases ] ) the phase @xmath49 is subject to the gauge symmetry , so we can fix the gauge by taking the constant value for it : @xmath50    studying the equations of motion on the boundaries we find , that the equation for the modulus @xmath51 is always satisfied by @xmath52 this is not surprising at all because the field @xmath53 , whose modulus is described by @xmath51 , is holographically dual to the quark bilinear operator @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the form of the solution is dictated by the canonical dimension @xmath55 of this operator : one branch behaves as @xmath56 and the other as @xmath57 .",
    "the two dimensional coefficients are related to the source of the operator ( which is for @xmath54 the quark mass @xmath58 ) and the vacuum expectation value @xmath59 , namely the quark condensate .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 is related to the quark condensate as @xcite @xmath61 in what follows we study the chiral limit @xmath62 .",
    "we anticipate that the properties of the baryons are not changed significantly in this limit .    at the boundary @xmath46 we choose the vacuum state with @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the absence of the sources for the vector currents in the system under consideration leads on the holographic side to the definite asymptotic of the vector fields @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "from ( [ energy - phases ] ) we find that the vanishing of the energy at @xmath46 allows the finite derivative of @xmath1 along the boundary , so we consider the change of @xmath1 from @xmath66 to @xmath67 on the way from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "the boundary @xmath47 is therefore characterized by @xmath68 and still @xmath63 .",
    "the finiteness of the energy requires that @xmath69 , but the derivative of @xmath70 can be finite provided that @xmath71 .",
    "consequently we can consider the change of @xmath70 from @xmath72 to @xmath67 along the @xmath47 boundary while @xmath21 runs from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "the similar picture is observed on the boundary @xmath48 .",
    "here we take @xmath74 and @xmath63 .",
    "although the energy is finite only for @xmath69 , the derivative of @xmath70 is related to @xmath75 as @xmath76 being finite .",
    "again we can consider the change of @xmath70 from @xmath72 to @xmath67 along the @xmath48 boundary .    on the remaining boundary @xmath5",
    "we impose the conditions which force the lagrangian to vanish .",
    "although this is not necessary for the finiteness of the energy , in more complicated models , for instance for the soft - wall model @xcite , these boundary conditions would allow to extend the region of integration on @xmath21 to infinity while keeping the energy finite .",
    "therefore the chosen boundary conditions on the ir wall ensure us that our treatment can be generalized to other holographic qcd models without qualitative changes .",
    "thus on the boundary @xmath5 we take @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . similarly to the @xmath46 boundary , the phase @xmath1 changes from @xmath66 to @xmath67 . the potential ( [ potential2 ] ) requires then , that @xmath80 changes from @xmath81 to @xmath72 ( taking ( [ alpha ] ) into account ) .",
    ".the boundary values for the phases ( [ phases ] ) , which describe the solution with unit baryon charge .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we use the value for the @xmath51 ( [ chi ] ) in the chiral limit .",
    "all boundary conditions are defined by the two functions @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "their form is arbitrary apart of the boundary values @xmath84 moreover , the regularity of the energy and the absence of sources require that the first and second derivatives of these functions are zero on the boundaries .",
    "hence , the asymptotic values of the solution , which we look for , are characterized by the two step - like functions .",
    "we can introduce the parameters describing positions of `` steps '' and their widths .",
    "these four parameters would be the moduli of the instanton : its position on 2d plane and its diameters in two directions .",
    "in our model these parameters are not the moduli in the full sense , because the energy of the solution depends on them .    in our numerical study",
    "we construct the solution to equations of motion , which follow from ( [ action - scalars ] ) , with the boundary conditions from table 2 for the particular choice of the position and diameters .",
    "given the solution we calculate its energy .",
    "then we repeat this procedure for the different choices of the parameters and try to find the solution with the minimal energy .",
    "thus we perform the scan of the four dimensional parameter space in order to find the true stable solution . in the end of the day we find the solution with minimal energy for a number of values of @xmath85 , which is the only dimensionless parameter of the model .",
    "the details of the numerical study can be found in the appendix .",
    "a few interesting facts can be observed while searching for the optimal values of the moduli of the solution .",
    "first of all we find , that the solution tend to have a smallest possible radius in the @xmath21 direction and the largest possible in the @xmath22 direction .",
    "that means it looks more or less as a thin disk ( see fig .",
    "[ disk ] ) .",
    "this form reminds us of the solution considered in our previous work @xcite , where the domain wall like configuration was obtained .",
    "thus our present solution preserves the analogy pointed out in @xcite with the picture of the skyrmion , catched on the domain wall @xcite .",
    "even more interesting is the behavior of the optimal coordinates of the solution .",
    "while the @xmath22 coordinate is fixed by the balance of the large derivatives in the core of the instanton ( at @xmath47 ) and large volume on the outskirts ( at @xmath48 ) and does nt show any dependence on the @xmath60 , the @xmath21 coordinate of the solution is tightly related to the value of the chiral condensate .",
    "we find , that for large values of @xmath60 the optimal position of the instanton is located somewhere between ir and uv boundaries of the bulk space .",
    "this is in contrast with the usual behavior of the instanton solutions in @xmath86 @xcite , which tend to fall on the ir boundary because due to the metric factor @xmath87 the energy is less for large values of @xmath21 . in our treatment",
    "we find , that the chiral condensate provides a counter force , which drives the solution from ir boundary into the bulk .",
    "the larger @xmath60 we take , the lower is the optimal position of the instanton . on the other hand ,",
    "when we consider smaller @xmath60 , solution tends to stabilize at the larger @xmath21 until it finally touches the boundary .",
    "further decreasing @xmath60 gives no effect , because the solution can not get closer to the boundary as it would require diminishing its size and will lead to the growth of the kinetic part of the energy .",
    "this treatment shows , that the chiral condensate and the related bifundamental field @xmath53 play the important role of stabilizing the position of the instanton solution , which we consider in this work .",
    "this points to the fundamental relation between baryon and chiral physics in qcd .",
    "the fact that the chiral condensate governs the @xmath21 position of the solution and the energy of the solution that is the mass of the baryon suggests to study the dependence of the baryon mass on the chiral condensate in our model . on fig .",
    "[ masses ] we plot the energy ( mass ) of the optimal solution with respect to the cube root of @xmath60 , everything normalized to the position of the ir boundary @xmath73 .",
    "again we see that for small @xmath60 the energy does not change since the solution lyes just on the ir boundary , but for larger @xmath60 the solution detaches from the boundary and the mass start to grow with the chiral condensate .",
    "the striking feature of this plot is the obviously linear dependence of the baryon mass on the energy scale of the condensate .",
    "this fits with the ioffe s formula with the additional constant term @xcite @xmath88.\\ ] ] we find the approximate value @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , where the normalization ( [ sigma ] ) is used .",
    "this formula underestimates the mass of the physical baryon by the factor of 3 and this effect may be attributed to the uncertainties in the parameter values in the `` hard - wall '' model or to the oversimplification of the bulk metric and the @xmath92 .",
    "nevertheless , we stress the linear dependence observed in ( [ result ] ) , which is in qualitative agreement with the ( [ form_ioffe ] ) , ( [ linear ] ) .",
    "it provides the very interesting resolution of the longstanding puzzle concerning the origin of the ioffe s formula .",
    "we shell discuss the interpretation of this result more in the last section .",
    "in this section we shall make a few general comments concerning the dyonic instanton realization of the baryon and the states with higher baryonic charges .",
    "first , remind the initial brane realization of the lambert - tong dyonic instanton @xcite .",
    "it is represented by the two parallel d4 branes displaced in some direction at the distance identified with the scalar vev .",
    "there are d0 branes localized at the d4 branes and f1 strings connecting d0 branes .",
    "this configuration is unstable and decay into the tubular d2 brane ( or equivalently d2-@xmath93 pair ) which carries the flux due to dissolved d0 brane and the kaluza - klein modes due to f1 strings .",
    "the coordinate at the coulomb branch in 5d super yang - mills theory fixes the asymptotic value of the scalar and the instanton size and mass . the key point of the solution is the effective 4d electric charge which is fixed by the boundary condition and prevents the solution from shrinking .    in the case of the flavor gauge group",
    "the theory is defined on the worldvolume of d8-@xmath94 pair wrapped around @xmath95 and extended along the radial coordinate of the cigar geometry @xcite .",
    "the left and right d8 branes are connected in the chirally broken phase .",
    "what is the brane content of the flavor dyonic instanton ?",
    "the conventional instanton - skyrmion is represented by d4 brane wrapped around @xmath95 @xcite and the additional ingredient is the f1 string connecting the wrapped d4 branes .",
    "the asymptotic distance between the left and right flavor branes is fixed by the chiral condensate which is properly normalized vacuum expectation value of the bifundamental scalar @xcite similar to the case of the color dyonic instanton . as in the color group case",
    "we expect the blow up of d4 branes into the tubular d6 brane with zero total d6 charge .",
    "such blow up process is responsible for the callan - rubakov effect of the baryon decay induced by the monopole @xcite .",
    "could we make some additional qualitative remarks having in mind this brane realization ?",
    "first note that upon the chiral restoration phase transition the d8 branes get disconnected since the cigar configuration is substituted by the cylinder .",
    "it means that the dyonic instanton solution becomes more similar with the color dyonic instanton .",
    "the asymptotic value of the adjoint scalar is now the new parameter which fixes the baryon size upon the phase transition .",
    "naively the f1 string stretched between two d8 branes amounts to their attraction and instability .",
    "however this point deserves for the additional study .",
    "another point to be mentioned is the @xmath70-dependence . in the witten - sakai - sugimoto like picture the @xmath70-term",
    "is introduced as the holonomy of the one - form rr field along the compact coordinate of the cigar at infinity = _",
    "c_1 this results into the interesting possibility for @xmath70 dependence of the baryon .",
    "for the conventional skyrmion there is no @xmath70 dependence since the d4 branes are localized at the fixed point in the angular coordinate of the cigar .",
    "however since the d4 branes are blown up into the d6 brane we could ask if the @xmath96 field interacts with the gauge fields at the d6 worldvolume and enters the d6 worldvolume action . since from the four - dimensional viewpoint the d6 brane looks like a magnetic string we could speak on the worldsheet theory for this string .",
    "let us consider the cs terms in the 6 + 1 dimensional worldvolume theory on the d6 brane l_cs= _",
    "d6 c_3 f f + _",
    "d6 c_1f f f the first term amounts to the cs term on the d6 action with coefficient @xmath97 .",
    "the second term is more interesting and generates the @xmath70 -term at the worldsheet of the magnetic string with the baryonic charge similar to the picture developed in @xcite .",
    "hence at least for the state with b=2 with the expected toroidal structure we expect the nontrivial sensitivity to the bulk @xmath70-term .",
    "the key finding of our paper is that the infinite tower of mesons packed into the holographic gauge field with the flavor group as well as the chiral condensate are equally important for the determination of the baryon mass .",
    "the role of the chiral condensate is more complicated then naively ioffe s formula implies .",
    "it is not possible to claim that the mass of the baryon is completely fixed by the quark condensate , because it provides only one of two competing contributions .",
    "going back to the 80-ties recall that the derivation of the baryon mass @xcite in the sum rules approach is based on the consideration of the correlator of the three - quark baryonic current .",
    "the leading contribution turns out to be obtained from the quark condensate multiplied by the loop involving the two - quark state whose imaginary part involves the infinite tower of resonances .",
    "this realization has some similarity with our picture .",
    "indeed we have found that both chiral condensate and the tower of mesons are equally important .",
    "it would be very interesting to support these naive arguments by the holographic calculation of the two - point correlator of the baryonic currents .",
    "the behavior which we observe on fig .",
    "[ masses ] shows that the mass of the baryon is defined by the competition of two different mechanisms : one related to the conformal symmetry breaking , which is described in our model by the ir hard wall and another  the chiral condensate .",
    "when chiral condensate is small , the mass of the baryon is defined by the warp factor of the metric pulling the solution to the ir hard wall and the position @xmath73 of this wall .",
    "however when the condensate becomes large the position of the solution is governed by the interaction with the @xmath53 field and the value of @xmath60 . in this context",
    "we should pay the attention to the amazing fact , that the point on fig.[masses ] , where the lines describing different regimes intersect , namely the point , where two mechanisms are balanced , almost exactly coincide with the values of parameters , which provide the fit of the hard wall model to the real physical observables @xcite @xmath98 this fact could be considered as some evidence that the scale of chiral symmetry breaking and the scale of conformal symmetry breaking are related in such a way that provides the minimum baryon mass .    at a moment we could only speculate about the precise mechanism responsible for this competition .",
    "let us remind that the baryon mass can be obtained from the conformal anomaly determined by the trace of the energy - stress tensor @xmath99 m_bb|t_|b it is well - known that the conformal anomaly involves the gluon and quark contributions t_= trg^2 + m |qq where @xmath100 - is the beta - function of the gauge theory .",
    "widely appreciated viewpoint is that in the chiral limit we can neglect the second term and the baryon mass is determined purely by the gluon component of the baryon or the gluon condensate .",
    "however our analysis implies that such naive picture is oversimplified .",
    "it seems that the gluon condensate inside the baryon is nontrivial function of the chiral condensate and just minimization of the energy with respect to the chiral condensate provides the baryon mass .",
    "the interplay between the gluon and quark condensates is known at large quark mass and is responsible for the decoupling of the heavy flavor .",
    "the decoupling is valid in the holographic models @xcite indeed however it is not clear how it could work in our case in the dyonic instanton background .",
    "probably the recent discussion in @xcite is also relevant for this problem .",
    "there are a lot of questions which have to be elaborated within our approach .",
    "first of all it would be very interesting to analyze in details the solutions with higher baryonic charges .",
    "we expect to reproduce the toroidal structure of the @xmath101 solution known for a while in the low - energy qcd .",
    "it fits with the toroidal structure of the dyonic instanton with instanton number @xmath102 .",
    "it would be very interesting to investigate the amount of the proton spin carried by the quarks .",
    "the dyonic instanton is known to have very subtle contributions to the angular momentum .",
    "another interesting issue concerns the physical characteristics of the baryon like formfactors or higher tensor charges .",
    "this would demand to add the tensor deformation to the holographic model discussed in @xcite . another interesting possibility concerns the application of our analysis to the skyrmions in the solid state framework using the @xmath103 like geometry .",
    "finally mention the possibility to analyze the scenario for the baryon driven chiral phase transition @xcite in our framework .",
    "we plan to discuss these issues elsewhere .",
    "we are grateful to dmitry kharzeev and nuclear physics group of the stony brook university for the useful discussions , comments and the hospitality .",
    "a.k . thanks alexander rokhmanenkov for valuable advices concerning the numerical calculus .",
    "the work of a.k . and p.n.k .",
    "is partially supported by the ministry of education and science of the russian federation under contract 14.740.11.0347 and the dynasty foundation .",
    "thanks ftpi at university of minnesota where the part of the work has been done for the hospitality and support . the work is partially supported by rfbr grant no.12 - 02 - 00284 and pics- 12 - 02 - 91052 .",
    "we use numerics to obtain the solution to the equations of motion , which follow from ( [ action - scalars ] ) with boundary conditions specified in table 2 .",
    "first of all we rescale the domain where the solution is calculated by defining the dimensionless coordinates @xmath104 this reduces the domain to the unit square and allows us to include the boundary @xmath48 .",
    "similarly we introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath105 .",
    "note , that the dimensional constant @xmath106 defines the region in @xmath22 which is best resolved .",
    "later we will study the solution located at @xmath107 and @xmath106 will actually define its position in @xmath22 , namely the radius of the baryon .",
    "after rescaling all the coordinates we observe that the equations of motion we are about to solve are singular at three of four boundaries of the integration region , namely @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "thus we are required to use extreme caution when dealing with these boundaries .    in the gauge ( [ alpha ] )",
    "the equations of motion are elliptic and this allows us to use the relaxation procedure to define the solution by putting the equations on the grid and substituting the derivatives with the finite differences .",
    "we start with the initial guess , which is compatible with the boundary conditions in table 2 .",
    "this is @xmath110    as was already pointed out in the main text , the functions @xmath1 and @xmath70 are step - like .",
    "they assume definite values at the boundaries and have vanishing derivatives there .",
    "firstly we assumed them to behave as an error function ( the integral of the gauss ) , because it has well defined center and the width . for @xmath82",
    "this turns out to be a good choice , because we can control well the position and take quite a small radius of the solution  we are able to take it approximately @xmath111 ( see fig . [ disk ] ) . for the @xmath112 it turns out , that the energy falls with enlarging width of the step until the width is of order 1",
    "that tells us , that the exponential jump in the step is too fast .",
    "moreover , we do not need to control the position of the step along @xmath113 , because we have another parameter @xmath106 , which does the same job in the variable @xmath22 .",
    "so instead of exponential error function we use the polynomial step , which is located at @xmath107 , and control the position of the solution by @xmath106 .",
    "instead of discretizing expressions for initial guess on a grid and using them as the initial values for the relaxing functions we substitute the initial functions directly to the equations before introducing the grid and solve the equations for the deviations from this initial guess .",
    "this allows us to get rid of possible problems with discretizing derivatives on the singular boundaries .",
    "hence we expand the functions as @xmath114 ( the rescalings are introduced to handle the singular boundaries . ) after this substitution the problem is reduced to finding the solutions for the fields with tildes subject to the zero boundary conditions .",
    "we introduce the grid and consequently solve the discretized equations in each vertex to obtain the new values of the relaxing functions .",
    "we do not solve the equations on the boundary , as they are automatically satisfied by the boundary conditions .",
    "the procedure is repeated until the new values of the relaxing functions deviate from the previous ones less then in 5% .",
    "the resulting discrete functions are interpolated in order to compute the energy of the baryon via the integral ( [ action - scalars ] ) .",
