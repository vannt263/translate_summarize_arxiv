    "the @xmath1 theory has been the cornerstone of our understanding of critical phenomena , and has served as a prototypical field theory .",
    "its ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) properties crucially depend on the number of dimensions @xmath7 and the symmetry @xmath0 , where @xmath2 is the number of real components of the field @xmath8 @xcite . for @xmath9 the ir - stable ( critical ) fixed point is at a finite positive value of the self - interaction , which approaches zero as @xmath7 tends to four , and becomes negative and bicritical for @xmath10 . at dimensions @xmath10",
    "therefore the long - distance ( ir ) behavior of the @xmath1 theory is trivial , but there is a nontrivial , interacting , uv - stable fixed point , albeit at a negative value of the self - interaction , at which the theory appears unlikely to be completely stable .",
    "a reformulation in which the theory at the interacting uv fixed point would emerge from the renormalization group ( rg ) flow of a more complete theory would therefore be useful .",
    "indeed , such a correspondence between the uv - stable fixed point of one theory and the ir - stable fixed point of another has been established before between the gross - neveu model and the gross - neveu - yukawa field theory for dimensions @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "a possible such `` uv completion '' of the @xmath1 theory was recently proposed by fei , giombi , and klebanov @xcite in the form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and the summation over the repeated indices is assumed .",
    "the new scalar @xmath14 may be understood as the hubbard - stratonovich field used to decouple the original @xmath15 quartic term in the _ scalar _ channel , which has acquired its own dynamics by the integration over the high - energy modes of the original field @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry also allows two ir - relevant quadratic terms , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , which have been tuned to zero to be at the critical surface .",
    "the advantage of this reformulation of the @xmath1 theory is that the two interaction coupling constants allowed by the @xmath0 symmetry , the self - interaction of the new fields @xmath14 , @xmath18 , and the `` yukawa '' coupling @xmath19 , are both marginal in the same dimension @xmath20 .",
    "below six dimensions therefore one may hope to find a weakly - coupled ir - stable fixed point at infinitesimal values of @xmath19 and @xmath18 , when @xmath21 .",
    "such an interacting @xmath0-symmetric field theory above four dimensions would then at large distances correspond to the @xmath1 theory at the uv - stable fixed point in the original formulation , and provide a stable , conformal , uv - complete version of it .",
    "the above correspondence was further argued @xcite to be indeed born out at a sufficiently large value of @xmath2 @xcite : to the lowest order in the small parameter @xmath22 the fixed - point values of the couplings @xmath19 and @xmath18 are real , and consequently the theory is unitary , only for @xmath23 .",
    "further two - loop and three - loop corrections @xcite indicated a possible dramatic reduction of the critical value of @xmath2 when the parameter @xmath24 is extended to the physical value of @xmath25 , for example , but the question of the existence of the unitary @xmath0-symmetric conformal field theory in five dimensions for reasonably low values of @xmath2 has remained open . in this paper",
    "we propose a different reformulation of the @xmath1 theory , which yields such weakly - coupled , real , @xmath0-symmetric ir - stable fixed points for @xmath3 and @xmath4 near six dimensions .",
    "the idea is to decouple the @xmath1 term in the _ tensorial _ instead of in the scalar channel .",
    "instead of the theory we consider : @xmath26.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the indices @xmath27 as before , but @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of components of the irreducible ( traceless ) tensor of the second rank under @xmath0 rotations .",
    "the @xmath30 matrices @xmath31 provide a basis in the space of traceless , real , symmetric @xmath2-dimensional matrices , and reduce to the two familiar real pauli matrices for @xmath3 , and the five real gell - mann matrices for @xmath4 , for example @xcite .",
    "the two ir - relevant mass terms , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , have again been tuned to zero .",
    "again , at such a critical surface with @xmath34 the couplings @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the only ones that at the gaussian fixed point turn ir relevant infinitesimally below @xmath20 , and one hopes for a weakly - coupled ir - stable fixed point at real values of the couplings .",
    "we indeed find such ir - stable fixed points of for @xmath3 and @xmath4 near @xmath20 in our one - loop calculation , but not for @xmath35 .",
    "our approach may therefore be understood as being complementary to the large-@xmath2 strategy of ref .",
    "the situation becomes particularly simple and transparent when @xmath3 and the cubic term in @xmath36 in fact vanishes identically , leaving the theory with a single ir - relevant yukawa coupling @xmath19 .",
    "we will therefore begin our discussion in the next section with this example .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we start with the simplest example when @xmath3 .",
    "the general case is then discussed next , in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv we present the one - loop flow equations and the concomitant fixed - point structure in the @xmath18-@xmath19 critical plane .",
    "we briefly summarize and discuss the results in the concluding section .",
    "consider the bosonic @xmath1 field theory with two - component real field @xmath37 .",
    "the quartic term can obviously also be written as @xmath38 this suggests the following alternative hubbard - stratonovich decoupling of the negative quartic term in the lagrangian density , @xmath39 which is @xmath40 where the index @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are the two real pauli matrices .",
    "the equivalence of the left- and right - hand sides of eq .",
    "is exact ( modulo normalization ) at the level of the partition function ,    @xmath43   =   \\int \\mathcal d\\phi_i \\mathcal d z_a   \\exp\\biggl [     -   \\int d^d x \\biggl (      \\frac{1}{2}\\phi_i(m_\\phi^2-\\partial_\\mu^2)\\phi_i + \\frac{1}{2 } z_a z_a",

    "the integration over the high - energy modes of the field @xmath8 will generate further terms in the expansion in powers of the auxiliary field @xmath44 and the momentum , as allowed by the @xmath5 symmetry , such as @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , etc .",
    "note that for @xmath3 no term cubic in @xmath14 is possible , as @xmath48 for @xmath49 . among the above allowed terms , in @xmath50 dimensions we need to keep only the first one , since all others will be ir irrelevant near the putative weakly - coupled fixed point .",
    "the field theory therefore becomes @xmath51 which is recognized to be a special case of eq .  ,",
    "in which the term cubic in @xmath14 is absent , and with the two mass terms explicitly displayed for completeness .",
    "to see that a similar trick as in the previous section can be played for any @xmath2 , consider the quadratic form with the hubbard - stratonovich fields @xmath44 , @xmath28 , and the basis in the traceless , real , symmetric @xmath2-dimensional matrix space @xmath31 . in the sense of hubbard - stratonivich transformation , @xmath53 since , on the other hand , completeness of the set of matrices @xmath31 in the space of real , symmetric , @xmath2-dimensional matrices implies that  @xcite @xmath54 one finds that the right - hand side of eq .",
    "is actually proportional to the standard @xmath1 term : @xmath55 this identity , which generalizes eq .   to higher values of @xmath2",
    ", implies that the usual @xmath0-symmetric quartic term @xmath56 can also be hubbard - stratonovich decoupled using @xmath30 real fields @xmath44 that transform under the rotational group @xmath0 as the components of the traceless symmetric second - rank tensor .",
    "the main novelty compared to the @xmath3 case is that the cubic invariant @xmath57\\ ] ] is finite when @xmath58 , and has the same engineering scaling dimension as the yukawa term @xmath59 . in @xmath50 dimension and when @xmath60 it suffices then to consider the theory in eq .   with the two displayed cubic interaction terms allowed by the @xmath0 symmetry only .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to compute the one - loop beta functions for the two cubic - term couplings .",

    "the stable fixed point is denoted by c , whereas a and b are both unstable in one direction .",
    "the fixed points b and c are very close to each other , due to the value of @xmath4 being near the critical value of @xmath79 at which they would coincide . for @xmath2 below this critical value the fixed points b and c would both become complex  @xcite . ]",

    "this is the fixed point discussed before in the context of the thermal nematic phase transition in liquid crystals by priest and lubensky @xcite .",
    "as @xmath98 , however , the value of @xmath90 runs off to infinity , so that for @xmath99 there are again no stable fixed points at the critical manifold .",
    "we have found that both physical values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 lie within the intervals in which there is a stable nontrivial fixed point of the theory  , at the critical manifold with both relevant quadratic terms tuned to zero .",
    "it is tempting to conjecture that these fixed points describe the same universal physics as the usual wilson - fisher fixed point at negative coupling in the @xmath1 theory above four dimensions .",
    "these fixed points allow a consistent and predictive uv completion of the theory ",
    "its perturbative nonrenormalizability notwithstanding . near and below six dimensions our tensorial cubic theory hence constitutes another precious example of an asymptotically safe quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "the open question , however , is whether these fixed points survive the extension all the way to five dimensions .",
    "the @xmath4 fixed point , being so close to the edge towards the region without stable fixed points ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : flow_03 ] ) , seems to be in particular danger .",
    "this issue requires further study , by higher - order epsilon expansion , or functional rg , for example .",
    "one expects the critical values of @xmath2 at which the fixed - point structure of the flow diagram qualitatively changes to behave as @xcite @xmath100 where we have computed only the leading terms @xmath101 here to be @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 . the corrections to these values would then follow from two - loop ( @xmath106 ) , three - loop ( @xmath107 ) , and higher - order calculations , similarly as computed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the theory in eq .  .",
    "the existence of the nontrivial fixed points we predict should in principle also be testable in monte carlo rg studies , e.g. , by employing the technique developed recently to identify the uv fixed point of the three - dimensional nonlinear sigma model  @xcite .",
    "while the present scheme enables us to reveal the fixed - point structure and the stability properties of the rg flow , it appears hard to deduce the full form of the effective fixed - point potential and to examine the potential s ( global ) stability .",
