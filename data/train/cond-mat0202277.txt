    "the recent discovery@xcite of superconductivity in the intermetallic compound mgcni@xmath0 has initiated a number of studies aimed at elucidating the nature of its normal and superconducting states .",
    "apart from the fact that it is the first known superconducting compound which has a perovskite structure without oxygen , the interest is mainly due to the preference of superconductivity over ferromagnetism which is rather unexpected in a compound whose main ingredient is ni . by proposing an electronic analogy with the superconducting oxide perovskites ,",
    "al._@xcite suggested that holes in the ni d - states might be responsible for electrical conduction in this compound .",
    "the signs of the measured hall constant@xcite and thermoelectric power @xcite are , however , consistent with normal state transport occurring mainly due to electron - like carriers .",
    "most of the normal state transport properties , like the electrical resistivity @xmath1 , hall coefficient @xmath2 and thermoelectric power @xmath3 , show unusual temperature dependence .",
    "they are not amenable to a single unified description encompassing the low and high temperature regimes .",
    "for example , the hall coefficient is almost temperature independent below 140k , but , its magnitude decreases@xcite with increase in temperature above 140k . even though the conventional bloch - gruneisen expression provides a good fit above 70k , a power law seems@xcite to be better for @xmath1 below 70k .",
    "an electronic crossover occurring at t@xmath4 @xmath5 50k was proposed@xcite to account for these anomalies .",
    "the normal state nmr properties of mgcni@xmath0 are also anomalous@xcite and similar to what is seen in the exotic superconductor sr@xmath6ruo@xmath7 .",
    "observation@xcite of a zero bias conductance peak in the tunneling spectrum is argued to be a signature of unconventional pairing ( like in the case of sr@xmath6ruo@xmath7 ) in this compound .",
    "the nmr measurement@xcite below , on the other hand , shows a coherence peak whose magnetic field dependence is consistent with s - wave pairing .",
    "the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat below   is consistent@xcite with the conventional electron - phonon mechanism for superconductivity .",
    "analysis@xcite of the specific heat data suggests that this compound is a moderately strong - coupled ( electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath8 @xmath5 0.77 ) superconductor .",
    "the observed@xcite temperature dependence of h@xmath9 is typical of a conventional superconductor in the dirty limit .",
    "thus a complete understanding of the superconducting and normal states of this compound is yet to emerge .",
    "there have been a number of first principle electronic structure calculations using tight binding linear muffin tin orbital ( tb - lmto)@xcite , full potential linear muffin tin orbital ( fp - lmto)@xcite and full potential linear augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw)@xcite methods , within the local density approximation ( lda ) , to understand the electronic and magnetic properties of 3   and related compounds .",
    "calculations@xcite on 3  with u = 5 ev yields essentially the same band structure as that of the lda , indicating that electron - correlation effects of ni-3d electrons are unimportant in this compound .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the measured value of the wilson ratio@xcite is only 1.15 , typical of a system with modest electron - correlation effects .",
    "the results of these calculations are quite sensitive to the methods employed and also to the numerical values of the parameters .",
    "the general features of the band structure ( which , however , are essentially the same in all these calculations ) can be briefly summarised as follows : there is a strong hybridisation between the ni-3d electrons and the c-2p electrons and thus carbon plays the crucial role of the mediator of electron hopping .",
    "two of the bands cross the fermi level @xmath10 and hence both of them contribute to conduction .",
    "the density of states at the fermi level ( @xmath11 ) is predominantly due to ni-3d electrons .",
    "one of the distinguishing features of the density of states of this compound is a sharp peak around 50 mev ( its location is very sensitive to the method of calculation ) below @xmath12 arising from the @xmath13 anti - bonding states of ni-3d and c-2p states .",
    "the stoner enhancement@xcite is moderately strong to cause ferromagnetic spin fluctuations , but , not strong enough to obtain a ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "it is well known that the perovskite structure is conducive to a variety of interesting physical phenomena like superconductivity , magnetism , colossal magnetoresistance , etc .",
    "soon after the announcement@xcite of the discovery of superconductivity in 3 , tb - lmto calculations were performed @xcite to obtain guidelines for synthesis of related compounds with interesting physical properties .",
    "the results of the calculations for the pristine 3   are consistent with the reports now available in the literature@xcite .",
    "our calculations showed that mgcmn@xmath0 , mgcfe@xmath0 and mgcco@xmath0 may form , but they would be magnetic .",
    "replacement of mg with other alkaline - earth elements ca , sr and ba would be interesting .",
    "for example , cacni@xmath0 , cacfe@xmath0 and srcco@xmath0 would be magnetic , whereas srcni@xmath0 , bacni@xmath0 and cacco@xmath0 would be nonmagnetic .",
    "as mentioned earlier , band structure calculations showed that the fermi level in mgcni@xmath0 lies towards the right side of a peak in the density of states ( dos ) @xmath14 .",
    "removal of half an electron per formula unit would shift the fermi level to the peak in the dos . within the rigid band approximation ( rba ) , this can be achieved by substitution of ni@xmath0 by ni@xmath15co@xmath16 or ni@xmath17fe@xmath18 .",
    "our spin - polarised supercell calculations for mgcni@xmath19m@xmath20 showed an increase ( but much less than the rba estimate ) in @xmath11 , and more importantly , _ absence _ of a magnetic moment , for x=1/4 and 1/2 ( m = co ) and x=1/4 ( m = fe ) .",
    "hence an increase in   is expected until x=1/2 for m = co and x=1/4 for m = fe .",
    "furthermore , our calculations suggest a structural instability when the lattice parameter is changed either way . in particular , a lattice instability is conspicuous ( in the calculation ) at a modest estimated pressure of @xmath5 2 gpa .",
    "hence effect of application of pressure in this system would also be interesting . in what follows",
    ", we present the results of our analysis@xcite of the normal state resistance , the variation in superconducting properties upon fe and co substitution , and the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature and normal state resistance of mgcni@xmath0 .",
    "in addition to the pure 3 , a series of compounds mgcni@xmath19m@xmath20 ( x = 0.05 , 0.15 and 0.30 for m = fe ; x=0.05 , 0.10 , 0.20 and 0.40 for m = co ) were prepared in order to investigate the effect of hole doping . the samples were prepared by following the solid state reaction route described by he _",
    "starting materials used were mg(99.8% ) , ni(99.99% ) , fe(99.999% ) , co(99.99% ) and amorphous carbon(99% ) , all in the form of powder .",
    "20% excess of mg is taken in the starting mixture in order to compensate for the loss of mg due to evaporation .",
    "also an excess of 50% c is taken to obtain the optimum carbon stoichiometry@xcite in the compound .",
    "the raw materials were mixed thoroughly and were pressed into pellets .",
    "the pellets were subjected to the heating schedule described by he _",
    "al._@xcite , in an atmosphere of 92% ar and 8% h@xmath6 .",
    "the crystal structure of all the samples are characterized by x - ray diffraction . ac susceptibility and four - probe dc resistance have been measured in the range 4.2k -300k using home - made dip - sticks .",
    "the high pressure resistance measurement has been carried out for the pristine mgcni@xmath0 using a pressure locked opposed brigman anvils apparatus@xcite using the four - probe method .",
    "a superconducting pb manometer is used for pressure calibration .",
    "we have also characterized the microstructure of mgcni@xmath0 with sem .",
    "the x - ray patterns of the undoped and doped samples are consistent with a perovskite structure with the space group pm@xmath21 m .",
    "small amounts of unreacted ni ( 2 - 5% ) and mgo impurity ( @xmath222% ) were present in some of the samples . except for these blemishes ,",
    "all the samples are of good quality , with sharp x - ray diffraction peaks . the xrd pattern for mgcni@xmath0 is shown in fig . [ figxray ] as an example .",
    "the lattice parameter for the un - substituted mgcni@xmath0 was found to be 3.810 ( @xmath23 0.0004)@xmath24 which is in agreement with the values reported in the literature .",
    "no significant change in lattice parameter was noticed upon partial substitution of ni with fe or co. this observation is consistent with the very small variation of the lattice parameter , a(x=0 ) = 3.806 @xmath24 , a(x=3 ) = 3.802 @xmath24 , seen in the study of mgcni@xmath19co@xmath20 by ren _",

    "the residual resistivity ratio of this sample ( @xmath25 ) is 2.2 similar to that obtained by he _",

    "this discrepancy can be understood in terms of the possible differences in the microstructure that can be expected from the fact that unlike in the study of he _ et .",

    "[ figsem ] shows an sem pattern of one of the 3 samples .",
    "the fractal character of the sample , which is quite evident from this photograph , entails a much longer and corrugated path ( as compared to the bulk ) for the electrons .",
    "this makes the usual procedure of multiplying the resistance by the ( external ) area / length of the sample to get the resistivity @xmath26 erroneous@xcite .",
    "since the actual path length of the electrons in such a poorly connected medium is longer than that in the bulk , the apparent resistance will be larger than what is expected from a scaling based merely on the external geometry@xcite .",
    "hence there is a need for a geometric renormalisation while converting resistance into resistivity in sintered samples .",
    "our sample is more loosely packed ( compared to that of he _ et .",
    "al._@xcite ) and hence the larger apparent resistivity of our sample .",
    "a superconducting transition with an onset ( mid )  of 8.13 k ( 7.69 k ) is observed ( 90 - 10% of the transition width @xmath27  = 0.34k ) .",
    "the ac susceptibility measurement ( [ figchico ] ) shows a lower  ( onset   = 7.35 k ) consistent with the values reported in literature @xcite .",

    "[ eqbg ] , the constant @xmath29 represents the contribution to resistance from electron - impurity scattering , t@xmath30 term accounts for the contribution to resistance from electron - electron scattering and also from spin fluctuations , and last term is the bloch - gruneisen integral which represents the electron - phonon scattering .",
    "the coefficient @xmath31 obtained using the fit turns out to be negative and also the fitted value of the debye temperature ( @xmath32 @xmath5 110k ) is too low .",
    "if we substitute this value of @xmath32 and the reported value of the electron phonon coupling constant ( @xmath8 = 0.77 ) in the mcmillan s formula for   given by @xmath33 we get the superconducting transition temperature   @xmath5 4 k , much less than the experimental value ( we have taken @xmath34 to be 0.1 ) .",
    "= 7.0 cm    this and the reported @xcite temperature variation of the hall constant are consistent with a two band model of conduction involving @xmath35light electrons coupled to low frequency phonons and @xmath35heavy holes coupled to high frequency phonons@xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , band structure calculations show that two bands cross the fermi level ( see fig .",

    "there are equal _ number _ of electron - like and hole - like charge carriers@xcite in this compound and the effective mass of the hole - like carrier is almost ten times that of the electron - like carrier",

    "thus we can infer that superconductivity in 3 is due to hole - like carriers .",

    "we thus see that a consistent interpretation of the temperature dependence of both the normal state resistivity and the hall constant can be achieved by invoking a two band model of conduction .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the same physical picture can provide a satisfactory interpretation of the anomalies seen in the thermopower and nmr relaxation rate .",
    "we have also tried to study the effect of the proximity of the peak in the density of states ( van hove singularity ) close to the fermi level on the resistivity .",
    "it is seen@xcite that the chemical potential _ increases _ with temperature . as a result of this ,",
    "some of the electrons from the almost filled band go to the almost empty band ( @xmath56 increases at the expense of @xmath57@xcite ) .",

    "also , magnetic susceptibility measurements have demonstrated that co doping enhances spin fluctuations in 3@xcite .",
    "if we assume the pairing in 3 is of the s - wave type , then it will be suppressed by coupling of electrons ( more precisely , the holes ) with spin fluctuations .",
