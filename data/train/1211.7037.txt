    "the international network of large - scale interferometric gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors is currently undergoing an extensive technological upgrade towards what is commonly referred to as the `` second generation '' of gw detectors . upon completion , these second generation observatories , namely geo - hf @xcite , advanced ligo @xcite and advanced virgo @xcite , complemented by the new observatory kagra @xcite , will reach unprecedented sensitivities to gw - induced strain .",
    "this sensitivity improvement constitutes a major leap towards reaching the long - standing goal of the first direct measurement of gws .    besides power recycling ( pr ) , which was already implemented in the first generation ligo and virgo interferometers , signal recycling",
    "@xcite ( sr ) has been adopted for the optical layouts of all second generation detectors .",
    "dual recycling , i.e.  the combination of pr and sr , has already been successfully implemented and operated in the geo600 detector @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the injection of squeezed vacuum  a technique proposed by caves to improve the quantum noise limited sensitivity of gw detectors @xcite  will be employed to enhance the performance of geo - hf as well as the advanced ligo hanford observatory .",
    "the current geo600 detector has been the first large - scale interferometer to successfully demonstrate long - term stable squeezing injection and the associated broadband sensitivity improvement , already for the case of carrier - tuned sr . @xcite    the compatibility of _ detuned _ sr interferometers with squeezing injection was investigated theoretically by harms et al .",
    "this work led to the insight that the combination of these two techniques requires additional filter cavities in the squeezing path to take full advantage of the benefit from squeezing injection on the detector sensitivity .",
    "the use of filter cavities was previously suggested by kimble et al .  to compensate for radiation pressure noise in gw detectors @xcite .        as an alternative to conventional detuned sr , thring et al .  proposed the technique of twin signal recycling @xcite ( tsr ) which is based on introducing a second recycling mirror in the asymmetric port of the interferometer ( cf .",
    "[ fig : drmi_tsr_topologies ] ) .",
    "it was shown that , in contrast to detuned sr , an interferometer featuring tsr does not require additional filter cavities to maximize the benefit from squeezing injection in the shot noise - limited frequency regime .",
    "besides this , thring points out further advantages of tsr over conventional detuned sr in his paper : a sensitivity improvement over a wide frequency band and a less challenging gw signal readout scheme .",
    "the former can be attributed to the simultaneous resonant enhancement of both the upper and the lower gw signal sidebands , which can be arranged for in tsr configurations .",
    "the latter stems from the fact that in tsr configurations the gw signal is entirely contained in the phase quadrature of the carrier field , similar to the case of a conventional michelson interferometer .    in this paper",
    "we describe the electronic stabilization and long - term operation of a power recycled michelson interferometer with tsr , thus laying the foundation for further investigations of this topology to evaluate its viability for the application in gw interferometry .",
    "one such aspect , the broadband enhancement of the interferometer by squeezed light injection , was carried out in a subsequent experiment and was already reported on in @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our investigations was an existing dual recycling michelson interferometer ( drmi ) tabletop experiment @xcite  a scaled and largely simplified model of the geo600 interferometer  which we were aiming to extend to a power recycled tsr interferometer with a minimum of invasive changes .",
    "thus , we were able not only to experimentally test the power recycled tsr topology but also to evaluate the viability of tsr as an upgrade for existing interferometers with conventional sr .      by introducing an additional recycling mirror into the optical setup of the drmi ,",
    "the former signal recycling cavity ( src ) is converted into a system of two optically coupled cavities which we refer to as the _ twin signal recycling cavity _ ( tsrc ) throughout this paper .",
    "this cavity is formed by the newly introduced mirror and the michelson mirrors acting as the end mirrors , and the former signal recycling mirror acting as the coupling mirror . for clarity we will keep referring to the former signal recycling mirror as srm and",
    "denote the newly introduced mirror as _ twin signal recycling mirror _ ( tsrm ) .",
    "we will refer to the length of the tsrm ",
    "srm cavity as @xmath0 and , correspondingly , the average length of the cavity formed by the srm and the michelson end mirrors ( i.e.  the former src ) will be denoted as @xmath1 , in accordance with the nomenclature used in @xcite .",
    "three free parameters of the tsrm were to be determined : ( i ) reflectivity , ( ii ) radius of curvature ( roc ) and ( iii ) distance to the srm .",
    "these , either directly or indirectly , affect the frequency response as well as the structure of the sensing matrix of the `` optical plant '' which determines the complexity of the longitudinal control scheme .",
    "the reflectivity of the tsrm influences the level of resonant enhancement of the signal sidebands , which is in close analogy to the role of the srm reflectivity in a signal recycled interferometer .",
    "we chose a reflectivity of @xmath2% for our experiment .",
    "the roc of the tsrm and its distance to the srm can , generally , not be chosen independently .",
    "the boundary conditions for a stable and ( theoretically ) well mode matched cavity constrain the values these parameters can reasonably take on . from the control point of view",
    "it was desirable to chose @xmath3 such that , for given phase modulation ( pm ) control sideband frequencies , an error signal could be extracted for feedback to the tsrm which preferably exhibits only small coupling to the other longitudinal degrees of freedom ( dof ) in the interferometer . for a known length @xmath3 the corresponding tsrm curvature , which results in a stable and mode matched cavity , can then be easily determined .",
    "we will discuss our approach of determining the optimal length @xmath0 , driven by control considerations , in the following section .",
    "for the design of the sensing scheme we performed a series of numerical simulations , based on a steady - state frequency domain model of the power recycled tsr interferometer realized with the software _ finesse _ @xcite .",
    "besides the length @xmath3 the optimal locations of the length signal extration ports to obtain error signals for the four longitudinal dof of the interferometer were to be determined with the aid of the numerical model .",
    "these dof are the differential mode of the michelson arms ( mich ) , the power recycling cavity ( prc ) and the microscopic positions of the tsrm relative to the srm ( @xmath4 ) and the srm relative to the average position of the michelson end mirrors ( @xmath5 ) , respectively .        due to the coupled nature of the longitudinal dof in a power recycled tsr interferometer the extracted heterodyne length signals , likewise ,",
    "are coupled .",
    "this coupling can often be reduced by prudently designing the optical plant and the sensing system .",
    "however , the rf modulation scheme was carried over from the precursor drmi experiment and modulation frequencies were thus not intended as free parameters for the optimization of the sensing scheme . as a consequence ,",
    "the resulting sensing matrices were non - orthogonal but could be arranged for to have at least full rank by choosing appropriate values for the remaining free parameters . in this case",
    "the technique of _ gain hierarchy _ @xcite can often be applied and was successfully used in earlier interferometry experiments , e.g.  in @xcite .    .modulation / demodulation parameters of the signal extraction system . in the first column",
    "the longitudinal dof are listed along with , in brackets , the mirrors which were actuated upon to tune the respective dof .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : exeriment_params ]",
    "in this section we discuss the aspect of bringing the aligned and mode matched , yet uncontrolled interferometer to a fully locked state of its four longitudinal dof .",
    "the proportional gains of the feedback loops were optimized for long - term stable operation at @xmath6min.,scaledwidth=97.0% ]    .",
    "these signals were amplified and in turn applied to piezoelectric transducers actuating on the power recycling mirror ( blue trace ) , one of the michelson end mirrors ( orange trace ) , the signal recycling ( green trace ) and the twin signal recycling mirror ( magenta trace ) , respectively .",
    "long term drifts eventually led to a lock - loss of the instrument due to the limited range of the actuators.,scaledwidth=97.0% ]    the hierarchic stabilization of the lengths in the interferometer was carried out in the order which was derived from the numerical interferometer model , as described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : development_of_a_sensing_scheme ] . due to different types of imperfections ,",
    "which inevitably occur in any real interferometer , the extracted heterodyne signals were likely to deviate from those obtained from the strongly idealized numerical model . among these imperfections",
    "are e.g.  non - ideal mode matching and the presence of higher - order modes , non - optimal demodulation phases , deviations from nominal lengths and also the coupling of length fluctuations from yet unstabilized dof , which was not included in the model .",
    "several iterations were necessary to optimize the relevant parameters and settings to fully lock the interferometer for the first time . in this stage of the experiment",
    "the ccd camera in the detection port helped to determine whether the interferometer was accidentally locked on some residual higher order mode or on the desired fundamental mode .",
    "as a figure of merit , and also to document the transition of the interferometer from the initial , unlocked state to a fully locked final state , light powers in different optical ports along with the correction signals generated by the servo controllers were monitored during the acquisition phase and after lock was acquired .",
    "we used two digital storage oscilloscopes to record the data of two consecutive exemplary measurements which we present in figs .",
    "[ fig : dc_levels_locking ] and [ fig : control_signals_locking ] .",
    "the shaded regions in the plots represent different stages of the lock acquisition process :    1 .",
    "all dof unlocked , mirror positions randomly fluctuating .",
    "2 .   mich manually tuned close to the dark fringe , prc length locked ( red traces ) .",
    "mich locked on the dark fringe using p - polarized light ( green traces ) .",
    "the tsrm position was scanned by applying a triangular drive to its pzt .",
    "the srm was tuned manually to its operating point to obtain a decent error signal for feedback to the tsrm , to lock @xmath7 ( yellow traces ) .",
    "the position of srm stabilized to its designated operating point , @xmath8 locked ( blue traces ) .",
    "all longitudinal dof are electronically stabilized .",
    "proportional gains of the servo loops adjusted to optimize loop suppression .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : control_signals_locking ] , when @xmath8 lock is acquired at 1.4 minutes , we can observe a correlated jump in the srm and tsrm correction signals .",
    "this is due to the attempt of the tsrm servo to maintain the operating point for @xmath7 , i.e.  the servo commands the tsrm to swiftly follow the srm when the srm position is locked .",
    "the p - polarization - based probing of the mich degree of freedom gave rise to a small amount of s - polarized light leaking out of the asymmetric port .",
    "this is due to a non - degeneracy of s- and p- polarized light with respect to covered optical path lengths in the interferometer and resulted in a slight offset of the michelson operating point from the dark fringe for the s - polarized field .",
    "special care needed to be taken to prevent oscillations to occur in the servo controllers during acquisition . due to mutual dependencies of the control loops , a consequence of the coupling of the longitudinal dof , the proportional gains of the servo controllers needed to be set carefully , to thoroughly balance the suppression of disturbances that would cause immediate lock - loss versus loop instability .",
    "we also found that slightly tuning the higher sideband frequency improved the robustness of our locking scheme .",
    "this could be attributed to small deviations of the recycling cavity lengths from their nominal values .",
    "our optimizations of the experiment led to a gradual increase of the time the interferometer remained in a fully locked state of up to tens of minutes .",
    "the limited duration of the locks could be explained by long - term drifts in the longitudinal dof of the interferometer , e.g.  due to thermal expansion of components in the setup but also due to drifts of the input laser frequency .",
    "drifts exceeding the range of the pzt actuators eventually led to lock - loss of the interferometer . in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dc_levels_locking ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : control_signals_locking ] , lock of all four longitudinal dof was acquired 1.4 minutes after the measurement started and lasted for more than 20 minutes until the actuator range of the prm was exceeded .",
    "a significant improvement of the duty cycle could be expected from operating the interferometer in vacuum .",
    "this was , however , not within the scope of the experiment described here .",
    "in this paper we described the design , the implementation and the successful operation of a laboratory - scale power recycled michelson interferometer with twin signal recycling .    with the aid of numerical simulations we derived a length sensing and control scheme which we successfully applied to the experiment , to stably lock the interferometer in its four longitudinal degrees of freedom .",
    "after a series of iterative optimizations we were able to operate the fully locked interferometer on time scales of tens of minutes , limited by long - term drifts in the optical setup exceeding the range of the actuators .",
    "based on the setup discussed in this paper , the aspect of squeezing injection into a twin signal recycling interferometer was investigated in a subsequent experiment .",
    "results of this work were already published in @xcite .",
    "future work will include the transfer of the twin signal recycling technique to other detector topologies , e.g.  michelson interferometers with fabry - perot arm cavities , which will form the basis of all second generation as well as the planned third generation observatories , e.g.  the einstein telescope @xcite .",
