    "alpha orionis ( betelgeuse , hd 39801 ; hereafter @xmath1 ori ) is a supergiant of spectral type m2 iab :  and is a very bright far - infrared ( far - ir ) source .",
    "some extended structure in the far - ir was recognized around @xmath1 ori first by @xcite in the all - sky survey data of the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) . using an improved image reconstruction technique , @xcite produced images of better quality for @xmath1 ori and identified the extended structure around the star as an arc - shaped structure at the interface between the stellar wind and the local interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "such structures can be formed around mass - losing stars at which the ram pressure of the ambient ism balances with that of the stellar wind .",
    "these stellar wind bow shock arcs had already been found around hotter , more luminous ob stars in the _ iras _ all - sky maps @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite discovered a stellar wind bow shock arc around r hya , an asymptotic giant branch star ( an evolved star of lower mass and lower rate of mass loss ) , using the _ spitzer space telescope_.    far - ir emission from these arcs is probably due mainly to thermal emission of cold dust components of the stellar wind bow shock whose temperature peaks at far - ir .",
    "there may be contribution from low - excitation atomic lines such as [ o ] 63 @xmath2 m , [ o ] 145 @xmath2 m and [ c ] 158 @xmath2 m at these wavelengths .",
    "however , the exact emission mechanism of these far - ir bow shocks remains unclear , while an attempt to identify their spectroscopic nature is currently on - going with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope_. meanwhile , theoretical studies have been done both analytically @xcite and numerically ( e.g.@xcite ) and the structure of the stellar wind bow shocks has been understood reasonably well .    the _ akari infrared astronomy satellite _ ( _ akari _ ; @xcite ) makes the all - sky survey in the far - ir for the first time in 25 years since _ iras _ at much finer spatial resolution . to @xmath11 ) is much smaller than that of _ iras _ ( @xmath12 to @xmath13 ) . ]",
    "the original _ iras _ images of @xmath1 ori allowed only rough identification of the shape of the extended far - ir emission @xcite . the enhanced _",
    "iras _ images of @xmath1 ori yielded just the mean radius and width of the arc with a rough estimate for the position angle of the apex @xcite . in this paper , we characterize the structure of the far - ir stellar wind bow shock around @xmath1 ori , using higher spatial - resolution _ akari _ images , and investigate the kinematics of the star , bow shock and ism in the vicinity of the star by adopting the analytic solution of the bow shock @xcite and the most recent astrometric solutions for the star @xcite .",
    "we observed @xmath1 ori in the four bands at 65 , 90 , 140 and @xmath14 m using the far - ir surveyor ( fis ; @xcite ) on - board the akari satellite @xcite on 2006 september 21 as part of the mlhes ( `` excavating mass loss history in extended dust shells of evolved stars '' ) mission program ( pi : i.  yamamura ) .",
    "observations were made with the fis01 ( compact source photometry ) scan mode , in which two strips of forward and backward scans were done with a 70@xmath15 spacing at the @xmath16 s@xmath10 scan rate , resulting in the sky coverage of @xmath0 centered at the target .",
    "the fis slow - scan toolkit ( @xcite ; ver .",
    "20070914 ) was used to reduce the data .",
    "we found that the quality of the resulting map was improved when we used a combination of the temporal median filter with the width of 200 s ( or longer ) , temporal boxcar filter with the width of 90 s , and sigma clipping threshold of 1.5 .",
    "for the reduction of data in the short wavelength bands ( sw bands ; 65 and @xmath17 m ) , the results were improved further when we performed flat - fielding using the local `` blank '' sky data .",
    "furthermore , we applied a custom reduction process to remove pixel - dependent response variation by subtracting the baseline `` sky value '' from each pixel determined by a linear least - squares fit to the off - source pixel values in the time - series data .",
    "the resulting maps are in 15 and @xmath18 pixel@xmath10 ( default pixel scale ) for the sw and lw ( long wavelength ; 140 and @xmath14 m ) bands , respectively .",
    "the resulting 1 @xmath19 sensitivities are 4.0 , 4.1 , 6.5 and 19.7 mjy sr@xmath10 while achieving , on average , five , eight , 15 , and 10 sky coverages per pixel were at 65 , 90 , 140 and @xmath14 m , respectively .",
    "the sky emission ( the component removed during the reduction ) is found to be @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 mjy sr@xmath10 at 65 , 90 , 140 and @xmath14 m , respectively . photometry was done following the latest calibration method to address the effects due to slow transient response of the ge : ga detectors @xcite .",
    "image characteristics are summarized in table [ chara ] .",
    "the measured sky emission values are consistent with the estimates obtained with the _ spitzer planning observations tool _ ( _ spot _ ) based on the _ cobe / dirbe _ data @xcite in the wide bands at 90 and @xmath24 ( 28.7 and 52.1 mjy sr @xmath10 , respectively ) , while about @xmath25 larger in the narrow bands at 65 and @xmath26 ( 21.7 and 53.8 mjy sr @xmath10 , respectively ) . by design",

    "hence , good agreement between the measured and estimated sky emission values in the wide bands is reasonable .",
    "the @xmath25 discrepancy in the narrow bands , on the other hand , may indicate highly structured and variable [ o ] line emission at 63 and @xmath30 in the background in the vicinity of @xmath1 ori , an oxygen - rich supergiant suffering from heavy mass loss . with our data , however , we are unable to either prove or disprove this possibility , unfortunately .",

    "previously , the correction factors were assumed to be constants .    besides the central star , the arc and bar",
    "are also clearly detected in a much finer spatial scale than in the previous _ iras _ maps @xcite , even though the scan width was not wide enough to capture these structures in their entirety .",

    "unfortunately , cryogenic liquid helium boiled off on 2007 august 26 and we were unable to obtain the additional data . while detailed analysis of the structure of the arc has to wait until the all - sky data become available , we can still make use of the data at hand .",

    "the far - ir arc around @xmath1 ori has been interpreted as the interface between the interstellar medium ( ism ) and the circumstellar envelope developed by the stellar wind ( @xcite ) at which the ram pressure of the ambient ism balances with that of the stellar wind , as has been found around ob stars @xcite .",
    "the shape of such bow - shock arcs has been shown to follows the curve @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 is the stand - off distance between the star and the apex of the bow and @xmath64 is the distance of the bow from the symmetric @xmath65 axis of the bow ) both numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite .",
    "the shape of the arc around @xmath1 ori , however , appears to be much more circular .",
    "if one traces the brightness peak of the arc to fit an ellipse , such an ellipse turns out to have the semi - major axis length of @xmath66 and the eccentricity of 0.02 centered at @xmath67 off the star at the position angle of @xmath5 east of north .",
    "@xcite have already shown that the apparent shape of the bow becomes more circular upon the consideration of the inclination angle .",
    "since we have an exact analytic solution for stellar wind bow shocks developed by @xcite , namely , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the polar angle from the apex of the bow , and the observed shape of the arc is simply a conic section of an axisymmetric bow shock cone , we can fit the brightness peak of the arc to this solution .    for a given set of the stand - off distance and inclination and position angles of the bow ( these angles define the 3-d orientation of the bow )",
    ", one can predict how the bow appears in the plane of the sky assuming that ( i ) far - ir emission is mainly due to thermal dust emission , ( ii ) the shell is optically thin to far - ir light and ( iii ) the column density of dust is the highest where the bow intersects with the plane of the sky . dust",
    "radiative transfer calculations in the circumstellar shells have shown that the above assumption ( iii ) is generally valid as long as the assumption ( ii ) is valid ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "then , one can quantify the difference of the prediction from the data by computing the inverse of the sum of the squares of the differences between the distance from the star to the arc peak and that from the star to the predicted positions of the arc .",
    "since this quantity represents the `` correlation '' between the data and prediction , it tends to be small if the prediction differs from what the data suggest .",
    "thus , one can find the best - fit parameter set by locating the point in the parameter space at which this quantity becomes the largest .    through this method",
    ", we find the stand - off distance ( de - projected ) to be @xmath70 , the position angle to be @xmath71 and the inclination angle to be @xmath72 .",

    "figure [ arc ] shows the position of the apex of the best - fit bow shock cone projected in the plane of the sky .",
    "the position angle is consistent with what has been concluded from lower resolution _ iras _ maps ( @xmath73 ; @xcite ) and is now more accurately determined with higher resolution _ akari _ maps . adopting the heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath74 km s@xmath10 ( the mean of the measurements made by @xcite and @xcite as used by @xcite )",
    ", we see that the bow shock cone is oriented _ into _ the plane of the sky , unlike the previous studies assumed to be close to edge - on ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "this is the first observational determination of the inclination angle of a stellar wind bow shock , owing to higher resolution _ akari _ maps .",
    "the stand - off distance is determined by the ram pressure balance of the wind and ambient ism .",
    "therefore , starting from the pressure balance equation @xmath75 , one can determine the stand - off distance for a star that loses mass via an isotropic stellar wind of velocity @xmath76 and mass - loss rate @xmath77 while traveling through the ism of a uniform density @xmath78 at velocity of @xmath79 , the stand - off distance is @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath1 ori , we have fairly well - established estimates for @xmath81 m@xmath82 yr@xmath10 @xcite and @xmath83 km s@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite have derived the new distance of @xmath84 pc to @xmath1 ori based on astrometric solutions obtained by combining _ hipparcos _",

    "the de - projected stand - off distance @xmath63 is @xmath85 cm . by keeping the interstellar hydrogen nucleus density at @xmath1 ori , @xmath7 , as a free parameter , the peculiar velocity of the star _ with respect to the ism in the vicinity of @xmath1 ori _ is @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the mean nucleus number per hydrogen nucleus for local medium ( @xmath88 ) and @xmath89 is the mass of hydrogen nucleus",
    ".    given the orientation of the bow shock cone , the peculiar velocity of the star _ with respect to the ism in the vicinity @xmath1 ori _ can be decomposed into each of the equatorial space - velocity components ( the radial direction , the direction in right ascension corrected for declination and the direction in declination ) as @xmath90^{\\alpha~\\mathrm{ori}}_{\\alpha~\\mathrm{ori~ism } } =    \\left [   \\begin{array}{c }     33 \\pm 8 \\\\     18 \\pm 5 \\\\     13 \\pm 3    \\end{array }   \\right]~n_{\\rm h}^{-1/2}~(\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1})\\ ] ] these values can be converted to the galactic space - velocity components ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 where they are positive in the directions of the galactic center , galactic rotation and the north galactic pole , respectively ) through a spherical trigonometric transformation ( e.g.  @xcite ) as @xmath94^{\\alpha~\\mathrm{ori}}_{\\alpha~\\mathrm{ori~ism } } =    \\left [   \\begin{array}{c }    -34 \\pm 8 \\\\    -10 \\pm 4 \\\\    + 17 \\pm 5    \\end{array }   \\right]~n_{\\rm h}^{-1/2}~(\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1})\\ ] ] since these values are based purely on the orientation of the bow shock cone , they represent the galactic space - velocity components _ of @xmath1 ori with respect to the ism in the vicinity of @xmath1 ori_. here , the superscript to the [ @xmath91,@xmath92,@xmath93 ] vector indicates what velocity it refers to while the subscript refers to with respect to what the velocity is defined .      the new astrometric solutions by @xcite yield the _ heliocentric _ galactic space - velocity components _ of @xmath1 ori _ as @xmath94^{\\alpha~\\mathrm{ori}}_{\\odot } =    \\left [   \\begin{array}{c }    -22 \\pm 1 \\\\",
    "-12 \\pm 3 \\\\    + 21 \\pm 4    \\end{array }   \\right]~(\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1})\\ ] ] thus , by combining the above two sets of values we can compute the _ heliocentric _ galactic space - velocity components _ of the ism in the vicinity of @xmath1 ori _ as @xmath94^{\\alpha~\\mathrm{ori~ism}}_{\\odot } =    \\left [   \\begin{array}{c }    -22 \\pm 1 \\\\    -12 \\pm 3 \\\\    + 21 \\pm 4    \\end{array }   \\right ] -   \\left [   \\begin{array}{c }    -34 \\pm 8 \\\\    -10 \\pm 4 \\\\    + 17 \\pm 5    \\end{array }   \\right]~n_{\\rm h}^{-1/2}~(\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1})\\label{flow}\\ ] ] hence , the stellar wind bow shock around @xmath1 ori is a consequence of a mass - losing m supergiant moving in the ism that flows in the direction specified by the above space - velocity vector .",
    "this ism flow around @xmath1 ori must originate from somewhere in the vicinity of @xmath1 ori .",
    "the most probable source of this ism flow in the vicinity of @xmath1 ori is undoubtedly the orion ob1 association ( @xcite ) .",
    "assuming that all four sub - associations ( ob1a through ob1d ) contribute equally to generate the ism flow in the vicinity of @xmath1 ori , one can define the flow vector toward @xmath1 ori at @xmath96 = [ -182 , -66 , -31$]pc ] emanating from the mean position of the associations at @xmath97 = [ -350,-170,-133$]pc ] .",
    "then , one can search for values of @xmath7 that would align the ism flow vector @xmath98^{\\alpha~\\mathrm{ori~ism}}_{\\odot}$ ] with this flow from the orion ob1 association within the quoted uncertainties in eq .  [ flow ] .",
    "possible values of @xmath7 turns out to be 1.5 to 1.9 @xmath9 .",
    "these values are higher than @xmath99@xmath9 estimated for material in front of the orion ob association @xcite . in the direction of @xmath1 ori , however , the h column density is estimated to be @xmath100",
    "@xmath101 @xcite , implying @xmath102 @xmath9 for the distance of 197 pc . thus , our estimate of @xmath7 may not be too large .",
    "the _ heliocentric _ galactic space - velocity components _ of the ism flow in the vicinity of @xmath1 ori _ can be converted back to the equatorial space - velocity components through an inverse spherical trigonometric transformation as @xmath90_{\\odot}^{\\alpha~\\mathrm{ori~ism } } =    \\left [   \\begin{array}{c }   21 - 33~n_{\\rm h}^{-1/2 } \\\\",

    "\\end{array }   \\right]~(\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1})\\ ] ] thus , the ism around @xmath1 ori flows at about 11 km s@xmath10 into the position angle of @xmath103 out of the plane of the sky ( toward us ) .    since the stellar wind bow shock is a consequence of the peculiar motion of the star _ and _ the ism flow at the star , the apparent orientation of the bow shock would not necessarily yield information on both .",
    "when the direction of the proper motion is aligned with the direction of the apex of the bow , the ism at the star is stationary with respect to the sun or flows against the peculiar motion of the star . on the other hand , when the direction of the proper motion is _ not _ aligned with the direction of the apex of the bow , the ism at the star probably flows obliquely with respect to the peculiar motion of the star .",
    "therefore , direct comparison of the orientation of the bow with respect to the direction of the peculiar motion of the star would provide a reasonable diagnostic for the presence and direction of the ism flow around the star .",
    "for the derived values of @xmath8 to 1.9 @xmath9 , the corresponding peculiar velocity of the star _ with respect to the ism in the vicinity of @xmath1 ori _ is 33 to 29 km s@xmath10 ( eq.[vpec ] ) .",
    "this means that the ratio of the peculiar velocity of the star to the wind velocity ( @xmath104 ) is @xmath105 to 1.9 .",
    "thus , the bow shock may be prone to instability ( @xcite ) and may even develop vortices ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ arc ] is a close - up of the northern part of the arc overlaid with a line that delineates the @xcite analytic solution at the 55@xmath39 position angle at the @xmath106 inclination angle . in general the wilkin curve",
    "predicts where the surface brightness peaks along the arc extremely well .",
    "however , as one follows the arc structure from the apex to the downstream direction , there is a discontinuity of surface brightness along the arc at the position angle @xmath107 and a local enhancement of surface brightness at around ( 0 , 7 ) from the star .",
    "the position of this local brightness enhancement is somewhat interior to the wilkin curve unlike other parts of the arc .",
    "this drop of surface brightness accompanied by a local enhancement off the wilkin curve may be due to vortex shedding caused by instabilities in the bow surface ( @xcite ) . in an isothermal bow shock , @xcite found that instabilities would manifest themselves as wiggles in the bow on the length scale of the stand - off distance .",
    "figure [ arc ] shows that reduction and enhancement of surface brightness occurs about the stand - off distance away from the apex .",
    "qualitatively , the observed structure of the bow shock resembles to that of the numerical models showing vortex shedding and the development of vortex rings .",
    "therefore , more detailed numerical investigations into the development of instabilities on the surface of the bow shock appears worthwhile .",
    "the existence of a linear bar structure ahead of @xmath1 ori is intriguing . at the moment",
    "there is no evidence that indicates the bar being a ( by)product of the interaction between the ism and stellar wind from @xmath1 ori or otherwise : the origin of the bar remains unclear .",
    "similarly , there is no evidence that suggests the bar is co - spatial with @xmath1 ori .",
    "however , our data ( table [ arcbar ] ) show higher optical depths in the bar than in the arc and in the background .",
    "moreover , the bar and background seem to have roughly the same optical depth values .",
    "thus , the bar appears to be more like the background cirrus than the arc , and hence , the bar is probably not caused by the interaction between the stellar wind and ism .",
    "also , assuming that these structures are made up with similar matter and have similar density , the differences in the optical depth suggests that the bar is extended along the line of sight like a sheet .",
    "if the bar represents a local concentration of matter co - spaced with @xmath1 ori , the motion of the star and angular separation between the star and bar imply a collision between the two in about 3000 yr .",
    "even if this is the case , it is still not clear whether the bar is caused by this ism flow in this region or is caused by other external means ( such as @xmath31 ori ) .",
    "akari / fis scan maps around @xmath1 ori ( @xmath0 ) at 65 , 90 , 140 and @xmath14 m are presented .",
    "these images show the extended emission core and most of the circumstellar arc plus the northern bar structure at much higher spatial scale than in the previously obtained _ iras _ maps",
    ". spatial resolution of the data is good enough to define the structure of the arc to be fit with the exact analytic solution for stellar wind bow shocks , while the scan did not cover the arc in its entirety and there are some anomalies by pixel cross - talk in the sw band and by ghosting in the @xmath14 m band due to the bright central star .",
    "rather circular appearance of the arc ( eccentricity 0.02 ) suggests that the stellar wind bow shock cone of @xmath3 de - projected stand - off distance is inclined at @xmath5 with respect to the plane of the sky and oriented at @xmath4 position angle ( east of north ) . adopting the distance of 197 pc ,",
    "rate of mass loss at @xmath108 m@xmath82 yr@xmath10 , and wind velocity of @xmath109 km s@xmath10 , the peculiar velocity of the star with respect to the ism at @xmath1 ori is found to be @xmath110 km s@xmath10 .    by comparing the galactic space - velocity components of the peculiar velocity of the star ( based on the orientation of the bow shock cone ) and that of the apparent motion of the star ( based on the astrometric solutions )",
    ", we derived the space - velocity components of the ism flow around the star . assuming that the ism flow in the vicinity of @xmath1 ori emanates from the orion ob 1 association , we find the particle number density per hydrogen nucleus ( @xmath7 ) in the ism around @xmath1 ori to be 1.5 to 1.9 @xmath9 , which translates to a 11 km s@xmath10 flow .    owing to higher spatial resolution of the data , we may be witnessing the development of a vortex ring along the surface of the bow due to instabilities .",
    "this research demonstrates that far - ir images of stellar wind bow shocks are excellent diagnostic tools to investigate the kinematics of the bow and the characteristics of the ism in the vicinity of the star .",
    "these stellar wind bow shocks have been found not only around m supergiants but also around ob stars @xcite and an agb star @xcite .",
    "therefore , this avenue of research is going to flourish with the coming of the akari all - sky survey @xcite followed by new opportunities with _ herschel space telescope _ and _ stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy _ , because there will be a wealth of new far - ir data on the stellar wind bow shocks around variety of mass - losing stars .    this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",

    "<S> we present @xmath0 scan maps around an m supergiant @xmath1 ori in at 65 , 90 , 140 and 160@xmath2 m obtained with the _ akari infrared astronomy satellite_. higher spatial resolution data with the exact analytic solution permit us to fit the de - projected shape of the stellar wind bow shock around @xmath1 ori to have the stand - off distance of @xmath3 , position angle of @xmath4 and inclination angle of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the bow shock suggests that the peculiar velocity of @xmath1 ori with respect to the local medium is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the hydrogen nucleus density at @xmath1 ori . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the local medium is of @xmath8 to 1.9 @xmath9 and the velocity of the local flow is at 11 km s@xmath10 by using the most recent astrometric solutions for @xmath1 ori under the assumption that the local medium is moving away from the orion ob 1 association . </S>",
    "<S> _ akari _ images may also reveal a vortex ring due to instabilities on the surface of the bow shock as demonstrated by numerical models . </S>",
    "<S> this research exemplifies the potential of _ akari _ all - sky data as well as follow - up observations with _ herschel space telescope _ and _ stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy _ for this avenue of research in revealing the nature of interaction between the stellar wind and interstellar medium . </S>"
