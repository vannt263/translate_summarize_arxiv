    "the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope has had a major impact on our understanding of pulsar physics with the discovery of over 100 @xmath0ray pulsars comprising three populations : young radio - loud pulsars , young radio - quiet pulsars and millisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "studying @xmath0ray pulsars with such a broad range of underlying physical parameters offers an opportunity of deeper understanding the physics underlying the pulsar @xmath0ray emission and magnetic field geometry .",
    "a major issue resolved early in the _ fermi _ mission was the site of the pulsar high - energy ( gev ) emission .",
    "the cutoff of the vela pulsar phase - averaged spectrum measured by the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite ruled out at high significance the super - exponential shape of magnetic pair production attenuation in polar cap cascades and established the location of the @xmath0ray emission and particle acceleration in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "present models for pulsar high - energy emission assume a vacuum retarded dipole ( vrd ) @xcite field geometry , which is expedient but fundamentally inconsistent .",
    "such models nevertheless have had some success in modeling fermi pulsar light curves ( lcs ) .",
    "outer gap ( og ) @xcite and slot gap ( sg ) @xcite models both derive regions of @xmath2 bordering the last open field - lines extending to the light - cylinder .",
    "the particles accelerating in these ` gaps ' produce curvature radiation ( cr ) and inverse - compton emission , with their lorentz factors limited by cr reaction forces that balance @xmath2 .",
    "the pattern of emission on the sky shows caustics that form on the trailing edge of the open field region of each magnetic pole as phase shifts due to dipole geometry , time - of - flight and aberration nearly cancel , and photons from a large range of altitudes arrive in phase @xcite .",
    "observers viewing at angles crossing the caustics will see one or two narrow peaks that resemble the @xmath0ray lcs seen by fermi . because the gev emission in these models takes place in a region near the pulsar last open field - lines ,",
    "the shape of the model lcs is sensitive to , and thus a good diagnostic of , the geometry of the pulsar magnetosphere near the light - cylinder .",
    "fortunately , this can now be addressed in detail , thanks to recent advances in numerical simulation of pulsar magnetospheres that model the high - altitude field structure critical to the high - energy emission . the global structure of realistic pulsar magnetospheres remains an unsolved problem . until recently ,",
    "pulsar lc modeling has employed the magnetospheric geometries of vrd and force - free - electrodynamics ( ffe ) @xcite .",
    "the effects of acceleration fields @xcite and open - zone currents @xcite on the lc have been explored , but these models are not fully self - consistent . in all these models ,",
    "the sweepback of the magnetic field - lines near the light - cylinder , due to retardation and currents , causes an offset of the polar cap ( pc ) ( and of the entire magnetosphere ) in the direction opposite to the rotation , which can affect the @xmath0ray lcs .",
    "@xcite modeled @xmath0ray lcs in ffe field geometry injecting photons along tangents to the field direction of the separatrix .",
    "@xcite injected photons only in regions of the ffe magnetosphere with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the current and @xmath5 is the local charge density , as in these regions the electron velocities are expected to be sufficiently close to @xmath6 to lead to gev photon production .",
    "more recently , @xcite assumed sg geometry to produce model lcs for the vrd and ffe magnetospheres , concluding that the vrd geometry provides better fits to the observed lcs than the ffe geometry .",
    "the ffe models present larger field - line sweepback and consequently the corresponding lcs have larger phase - lags relative to the radio pulse which is not consistent with that of observed @xmath7 lcs .",
    "most recently , resistive magnetosphere models have appeared in the literature ( kalapotharakos et al .",
    "2012 ( k12 , hereafter ) ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that drop the ideal - mhd requirement in favor of an ohms law that relates the current to the @xmath8 and @xmath9 fields through a finite conductivity .",
    "these simulations reveal a range of magnetic field structures , current distributions and spin - down power that lie between the vrd and the ffe solution .",
    "most importantly , models of finite conductivity possess regions of @xmath2 which are potential locations of high - energy emission .    in this letter",
    ", we explore for the first time the high - energy emission that is generated in resistive magnetospheres , using their magnetic field structure and @xmath2 to produce @xmath0ray lcs following two different approaches .",
    "first , we assume the emission geometry of the sg and og models and compute the resulting lcs for different values of conductivity to compare with those of the vrd and ffe geometries . in the second approach ,",
    "we define approximate particle trajectories , and we calculate the corresponding energies ( including radiation losses ) and cr emission . while neither of these approaches is self - consistent ,",
    "in that particle motions should affect the fields , they are an important first step in relating the field structure and acceleration dictated by global magnetosphere solutions to observations .",
    "dissipative magnetospheres are necessary for modeling pulsar lcs considering that neither the vrd nor the ffe solutions are compatible with the emission of radiation : the vrd solutions provide maximum accelerating field , @xmath10 , but no charges ( @xmath11 ) , while the ffe solutions have a sufficiently large number of particles to guarantee the nulling of @xmath10 .",
    "herein , we use the dissipative solutions presented recently by k12 , which use a phenomenological conductivity @xmath1 ( _ in lieu _ of microphysical processes ) to relate the current density @xmath12 to the fields @xmath13 .",
    "although these solutions are still not self - consistent , they are an improvement over those of vrd and ffe because , besides the global field geometry , they also provide the distribution of @xmath2 , a quantity necessary to compute the acceleration of radiating charges .    in the next sections we present model lcs using the structure of magnetic and electric fields provided by dissipative solutions of the perpendicular rotator ( @xmath14 ) which span the entire solution space from vrd to ffe .",
    "these solutions are presented in detail in k12 and have been produced adopting a very simple prescription for the current density @xmath15 in this case the current density consists of two components , namely a drift current and a component parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "while some simulations explored models with a spatially dependent @xmath1 , in this paper we will use only those with constant @xmath1 . as @xmath1 goes from 0 to @xmath16 the corresponding solution ranges from vrd to ffe .",
    "the solutions we consider here correspond to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the angular frequency of the star .",
    "the field structure of the solutions for @xmath20 and @xmath21 are shown in the last rows of figures 4 and 3 of k12 , respectively .      a simple method of generating pulsar lcs , used in many previous studies ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , adopts the geometry of physical emission models that have computed the shape of accelerator gaps with assumed field structure and sources of charge .",
    "this method can directly compare lcs from magnetospheres having finite conductivity with lcs in vrd and ffe magnetospheres . to explore how the magnetic field structure and offset pcs influence @xmath0ray pulsar lcs ,",
    "we have generated model lcs using a geometrical version of the sg and og models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sg has its origin in pc pair cascades that screen the accelerating parallel electric field @xmath10 over most of the open field except in narrow gaps along the last open field - lines @xcite .",
    "the electrons accelerate and radiate from the neutron star ( ns ) surface to high - altitude , and emission occurs throughout the volume of the gap @xcite .",
    "the og is a vacuum gap that also forms adjacent to the last open field - line , above the null charge surface where the corotation charge @xcite changes sign .",
    "the gap width is determined by the screening of @xmath2 by pair cascades and emission occurs in a thin region along the gap inner edge @xcite .",
    "components of the magnetic field are determined from analytic expressions for the vrd ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and interpolated from numerical simulations for ffe and resistive magnetospheres . the open field boundary on the ns surface ( the pc rim ) was determined via bisection in magnetic colatitude at fixed azimuth values .",
    "open volume radial and azimuthal coordinates ( ovc ) were then defined inside the open volume of each solution @xcite .",
    "we assume that particles travel from the ns surface along open field - lines in ovcs and emit radiation tangent to field - lines , uniformly , in the corotating frame ( cf ) .",
    "we assume that emission is also uniform across a sg of width @xmath22 , as a fraction of the open volume , on field - lines originating between @xmath23 and @xmath24 on the pc ( in units of pc radius ) and in a thin layer at @xmath25 in the og .",
    "the minimum and maximum spherical radii of emission are assumed to be the ns surface and @xmath26 , limited by a maximum cylindrical radius of @xmath27 , for the sg , and the null surface and @xmath28 , limited by @xmath29 , for the og .",
    "the photon direction is assumed to be tangent to the magnetic field in the cf , obtained through a lorentz transformation from the inertial observer s frame ( iof ) @xcite .",
    "the emission direction is then transformed to the iof ( aberration ) , time - delays are added and the emission is accumulated in sky - maps in viewing angle @xmath30 and phase @xmath31 with respect to the pulsar rotation axis .",
    "lcs are then obtained as slices through these maps at constant @xmath30 .      an altogether different approach to produce lcs that takes approximately into account the electric fields present in the specific magnetospheric solution",
    "is the following : since we anticipate the velocity of any particle of the magnetosphere to be very close to @xmath6 , we decompose its motion into a drift component and one parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "thus , one can write for the particle velocity @xmath32 the sign and the absolute value of the factor @xmath33 is chosen so that the motion of the particle be outward and the total modulus of the velocity @xmath34 be @xmath6 .",
    "this trajectory determination is similar to those of @xcite and @xcite . under this assumption",
    "we calculate the trajectories passing through each magnetospheric point inside a central cube of edge @xmath35 considering that in the dissipative solutions the particles do not follow the field - lines in the cf .",
    "so , instead of open and closed field - lines we determine open and closed trajectories depending on whether they reach ( or not ) @xmath36 , assuming that the radiating particles follow only open trajectories in the closed zone too ; we believe that this is due to approximations in our field computations and therefore we restrict radiation by particles accelerated only by the @xmath10 of the open zone . ] .",
    "this particle trajectory determination allows also the calculation of the local radius of curvature @xmath37 at each point of the magnetosphere .",
    "moreover , assuming that each particle starts at the stellar surface with a small @xmath38-value @xmath39 we can calculate its lorentz factor @xmath38 along its trajectory from @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the electron charge and rest - mass respectively .",
    "this approach allows us to have all the information needed to calculate the cr intensity contributed by each point of the magnetosphere and so the corresponding sky - maps and the lcs ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows geometric lcs for sg ( left - hand column ) and og ( right - hand column ) emission in vrd ( black ) and ffe ( purple ) solutions , and in resistive magnetospheres with @xmath43 ( red ) , and @xmath44 ( green ) for a range of observer angles @xmath30 .",
    "the resistive solutions of lowest @xmath1 are closest to the vrd and indeed , the computed lcs look very similar .",
    "however , there is a shift to larger phase and a slight broadening of the peaks of the @xmath43 lcs .",
    "as @xmath1 increases , in both the sg and og cases , the peaks are shifted even more to larger phase and the broadening is more pronounced , with the highest @xmath1-value being closest to the ffe solutions .",
    "indeed , their lcs look very similar , with only a slight shift in phase of the peaks but no further broadening .",
    "overall , there is a distinct progression in the lc shapes as conductivity increases .",
    "the vrd lcs have the narrowest peaks and the smallest phase - lag from the magnetic pole ( phase@xmath45 ) , with peak - width and phase - lag systematically increasing with conductivity .",
    "the lc changes with conductivity result from changes in magnetic field structure .",
    "magnetospheres with low @xmath1 are  stiffer \" and thus have less sweptback field - lines and smaller open field volume , while those with higher @xmath1 have more sweepback @xcite .",
    "the increase of sweepback with @xmath1 produces a larger shift of the pc which causes the larger phase - lag of the lc peaks .",
    "the increase in open volume of magnetospheres with large @xmath1 also causes the increase in peak - width , since the gap widths are assumed to be a fraction of the open volume .",
    "since peak - width and phase - lag are measurable characteristics of observed @xmath0ray pulsar lcs , this study shows that they could potentially be an important diagnostic of magnetospheric conductivity .",
    "comparison of geometric lcs in vrd and ffe magnetospheres has already indicated that vrd provides a better match to observed lcs @xcite .    in figure  [ figlc2 ]",
    "we plot the lcs for solutions corresponding to three different values of @xmath1 taking into account the physical properties provided by each solution as we describe in section 2.3 .",
    "the red , green and blue color correspond to @xmath46 , respectively . for these lcs",
    "we assume that emission occurs only along all open trajectories ( i.e. those that reach at least up to @xmath36 ) .",
    "the emission is considered to be due to cr and is always proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath38-value is derived by eq .",
    "[ dgamma ] .",
    "the total emissivity can also be weighted by the local charge density @xmath5 ( left - hand column of figure  [ figlc2 ] ) .",
    "the general feature is that the broadest ( narrowest ) pulses seem to be those corresponding to the middle ( high ) @xmath1-value @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "however , the lcs for @xmath49 and for the low @xmath30-values exhibit high off - pulse emission .",
    "this effect decreases when the charge density @xmath5 weighting is included .",
    "moreover , near @xmath50 , the middle @xmath1-value ( @xmath48 ) pulses are weak but only in the corresponding sky - maps .",
    "] , double and narrow .",
    "the general trend for the @xmath43 and @xmath48 solutions is that the phase - lag of the pulses with respect to the magnetic poles ( @xmath51 ) decreases with @xmath30 although there are counter examples .",
    "these phase - lags start from values higher than 0.25 ( for @xmath52 ) and only for @xmath30 near @xmath53 can reach close to 0.1 - 0.15 . for the high @xmath1-value ( @xmath49 ) the corresponding phase - lags seem to be near the value 0.25 for most of the cases implying a non - monotonic behavior with @xmath1 .",
    "we checked also the assumption that the emitting particles are mostly those that follow the high - voltage trajectories along a trajectory ] .",
    "this approach is similar to the geometric one ( section 2.2 ) in the sense that it is supposed that only a part of the magnetosphere contributes to the emission .",
    "the difference here is that the active region is traced by the high - voltage trajectories .",
    "figure  [ figlc2b ] is similar to figure  [ figlc2 ] but only the 10% of the highest - voltage trajectories are considered to emit . in this case",
    "we observe narrower pulses .",
    "however , only for the middle @xmath1-value ( @xmath48 ) we have pulses corresponding to small phase - lags .",
    "we note also that the low @xmath1-value ( @xmath43 ) is observable only from a relatively narrow range of @xmath30 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we derived also the lcs considering each point s emissivity @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the charge density on the star surface at the point where each particle starts its journey . in this case",
    "the results are similar to those of the right - hand columns of figures  [ figlc2 ] ,  [ figlc2b ] .",
    "in figure  [ fig3d ] we plot the points in the 3d magnetosphere that produce the pulses shown in the right - hand column of figure  [ figlc2 ] . in each of these cases",
    "we have identified the phases of the observed pulses for all @xmath57 and we located the points that contribute over 90% of the corresponding emission .",
    "the emissivity of each point is represented by the indicated color scale . in these figures",
    "we have also plotted the portion of the magnetic field - lines ( in gray ) that contribute to the emission in the sg model presented in figure  [ figlc1 ] .",
    "we see that there is always a blob of points over the polar caps contributing to the observed pulses .",
    "however , as we go toward high @xmath1-values the volume of these blobs decreases and new points from the outer magnetosphere are added . for @xmath43 and @xmath48",
    "the inner parts of the blobs coincide with only a subset of the sg lines .",
    "this subset increases with @xmath1 and at @xmath49 the largest part of the sg lines seem to follow the colored points . beyond the light - cylinder",
    ", this region coincides with the current - sheet ( figure  4 ) .",
    "this supports the result of @xcite where a significant part of the emission is produced near the current - sheet .",
    "the changes of the form of the effective emitting regions , described above , make the sky - maps evolution with @xmath1 complex .",
    "this makes the lcs ( figures  [ figlc2 ] ,  [ figlc2b ] ) evolve in a non - monotonic manner with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "however , inspection of the full sky - maps shows smooth evolution with increasing conductivity .    figures  [ figlc1]-[fig3d ] show that the geometric lcs are less sensitive to @xmath1 at high @xmath1-values than those of the trajectory approach .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath10 distribution changes more significantly than the magnetic field structure at high @xmath1 .",
    "we have presented a first implementation of dissipative magnetospheres to model pulsar emission for direct comparison with the fast accumulating pulsar phenomenology .",
    "we have concentrated here on the pulsar @xmath0ray lcs , however our models could also address spectral features . with lc modeling alone ,",
    "we have just scratched the surface of the problem , since we have used only one of the prescriptions discussed in k12 and only one inclination angle @xmath14 .",
    "a more complex behavior is expected for a variety of prescriptions and @xmath58 s .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show that more realistic pulsar magnetosphere models provide flexibility that allows meaningful constraints on their parameters in direct comparison with observations . while neither of the approaches employed are self - consistent in that they take into account the effects of the radiating particles on the magnetosphere itself , we find a progression in the lc shape , with peak phase and width increasing with @xmath1 in the sg and og models .",
    "observed fermi lat lcs show an inverse correlation between the peak separation @xmath59 ( in lcs with two peaks ) and phase - lag @xmath60 of the first peak relative to the radio - peak ( thought to be near @xmath51 ) @xcite .",
    "the first - peak phase - lags ( @xmath61 ) of high @xmath1 model lcs are too large to account for the observed @xmath60 of many lat pulsars with @xmath62 .",
    "the lcs computed in the particle trajectory approach can also produce narrow pulses , despite the fact that they assume particle emission at every point of the magnetosphere ; however , their consistency with observations may require specific values of @xmath30 , @xmath58 and @xmath1 . independently of whether this is true or not , the final calculation of the lcs depends also on the modulation by the local number of the emitting particles , which is something that can be derived only in fully self - consistent solutions .",
    "we plan to move in this direction by introducing pair cascade mechanisms and the calculation of the exact particle orbits ( using the full equations of motion ) , taking into account both cr and synchrotron losses , as well as inverse - compton radiation .",
    "we expect that with the dissipative models at hand , comparison of their model lc and spectral products with observations will allow us to find specific magnetospheric prescriptions and model parameters that provide the working physics of pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "all these will be the subject of future work .            .",
    "the color scale indicates the corresponding emissivity . for @xmath49 a significant part of",
    "the emission comes from a region near the current - sheet outside the light - cylinder ( gray surface in the right - hand panel).,title=\"fig : \" ] +"
