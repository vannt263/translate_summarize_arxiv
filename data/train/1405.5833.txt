    "a recent letter @xcite claims that a gamma - ray detector on an earth - orbiting satellite , e.g. fermi @xcite , would be sensitive to ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) interacting in jupiter s atmosphere .",
    "the satellite instrument would detect gamma rays from the shower of particles ( electrons , positrons and photons ) induced by uhecrs skimming jupiter s atmosphere , which may emerge from the atmosphere in a beam pointing to earth .",
    "this result can be shown to be incorrect by a simple argument .    for a uhecr shower to be detectable ,",
    "the number of gamma rays , @xmath0 , reaching the satellite must be greater than one : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of gamma rays in the shower at its exit point from the atmosphere , @xmath3 is the fraction of gamma rays emitted within a solid angle of half - angle @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the distance between earth and jupiter ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 is the area of the satellite detector ( @xmath8 ) . for a @xmath9 ev proton shower exiting jupiter s atmosphere at its maximum development , the number of electrons at the shower maximum is @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding number of photons @xmath2 was obtained by numerical integration of the solutions of the shower cascade equations @xcite . for a minimum gamma ray energy of 20  mev ( the lower detection limit in @xcite ) ,",
    "we found @xmath11 . from equation  [ eq : ng1 ]",
    ", we then derive : @xmath12 the inequality is fulfilled for @xmath13  rad and @xmath14 ( or for an even smaller @xmath4 if @xmath15 )",
    ". such an angular distribution would result in unphysical properties of the cosmic ray shower , for example a sub - cm radial extent incompatible by several order of magnitudes with the characteristic size of a shower ( e.g. moliere radius in air @xmath16  m ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that uhecr showers in jupiter s atmosphere can not be detected by an earth - orbiting satellite instrument .",
    "the results of @xcite are affected - in addition to other questionable approximations - by an erroneous assumption on the angular distribution of cosmic ray showers particles , namely that photons produced by an electron of energy @xmath17 have an average angle @xmath18 with respect to the shower axis , where @xmath19 is the electron mass .",
    "in fact , @xmath20 is representative of the angular scales occurring in the elementary processes that drive the shower development ( bremsstrahlung , compton scattering and pair production ) . instead , the angular distribution of both electrons and photons in a shower is dominated by multiple scattering of the electrons @xcite with a characteristic angle of @xmath21 , where @xmath22  mev . in the oversimplified treatment of @xcite",
    ", the flux of photons is thus overestimated by a factor @xmath23 .",
    "it may be interesting to evaluate other solar system objects as potential cosmic ray detectors . in the following ,",
    "we analyze in more details uhecrs skimming the atmosphere of the closest object , earth .    with a better approximation than equation  [ eq : ng1 ] ,",
    "the condition to detect a uhecr shower can be written as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the normalized photon angular distribution and @xmath26 is the solid angle subtended by the satellite instrument .",
    "detectable showers come from directions close to the satellite horizon , corresponding to a distance @xmath27  km for an orbit of 500 km altitude .",
    "the angular distribution of photons follows closely the angular distribution of electrons in the shower @xcite . to estimate @xmath25 , we convoluted the electron angular distribution , parametrized in @xcite as a function of the electron energy , with the electron energy spectrum at shower maximum as given in @xcite .",
    "a minimum electron energy of 20  mev was required for consistency with section  [ jupiter ] .",
    "also , we took @xmath28 , corresponding to a @xmath9  ev uhecr ( see section  [ jupiter ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : ngamma ] , @xmath0 is shown as a function of the angle @xmath4 . the detectability condition expressed by equation  [ eq : ng2 ]",
    "is fulfilled up to a maximum angle @xmath29 .",
    "thus , a uhecr shower skimming the earth atmosphere is in principle detectable by a satellite instrument . however , it remains to be proven that a significant statistics of uhecrs may be collected with this technique . to estimate the aperture of an orbiting satellite",
    ", we performed a monte carlo simulation .",
    "a uniform distribution of the shower s impact point was generated over the earth atmosphere taken as a spherical surface .",
    "the shower direction was then generated according to an isotropic distribution .",
    "for each shower , the column density along its path in the atmosphere was calculated using the us standard atmosphere model @xcite . to ensure enough particles at the exit point ,",
    "only showers with a column density between 600  @xmath30 and 1200  @xmath30 were further considered ( within this range , @xmath31 for a @xmath9  ev proton shower ) .",
    "a shower was considered to be detected when the satellite was within an angle @xmath4 from the shower direction , with the vertex of the detection angle located at the point where the shower exits the atmosphere . in figure",
    "[ fig : aperture ] , the geometrical aperture estimated from the simulation is shown as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the aperture for @xmath32 is found to be @xmath33 km@xmath34sr .",
    "lower uhecr energies will result in smaller apertures : for example , a @xmath35  ev shower would have @xmath36 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : ngamma ] ) and a corresponding aperture of only @xmath37 km@xmath34sr ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : aperture ] ) . for comparison , the geometrical aperture of the pierre auger observatory @xcite , the largest ground based uhecr facility , amounts to @xmath38 km@xmath34sr for all uhecr energies above @xmath39  ev .",
    "we also evaluated the case of uhecrs skimming the moon surface , where the shower develops in the lunar regolith before exiting the surface .",
    "the corresponding aperture was found to be even smaller than that obtained for earth .",
    "other solar system objects were also excluded as effective cosmic ray detectors by similar calculations .",
    "notice that the aperture in figure  [ fig : aperture ] is valid for any beamed emission from uhecr air showers . in particular",
    ", our findings also apply to radio emission from uhecr showers , which has similar angular scales @xcite .",
    "we have critically reviewed the claim @xcite that jupiter can be an efficient detector for uhecrs .",
    "we found that the number of gamma rays from a uhecr shower skimming jupiter s atmosphere is too low to be detectable by an earth - orbiting satellite .",
    "we also investigated the potential of such a technique for other solar system objects . in the best case of earth",
    ", we found that uhecrs skimming the earth atmosphere are in principle detectable , but the aperture of an orbiting satellite is much smaller than traditional ground arrays .",
    "this result is also valid for beamed radio emission from uhecr showers .",
    "we conclude that this technique is not worthwhile further attention .",
