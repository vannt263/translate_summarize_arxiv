    "heisenberg discussed a thought experiment about the position measurement of a particle by the @xmath0-ray microscope and found the trade - off relation between the error @xmath1 in the position measurement and the disturbance @xmath2 to the momentum caused by the measurement process @xmath2",
    "@xcite : @xmath3 this inequality epitomizes the complementarity of quantum measurements : we can not perform the measurement of an observable without causing disturbance to its canonically conjugate observable . at the inception of quantum mechanics , the kennard - robertson inequality  @xcite @xmath4 \\rangle}}|\\ ] ] was erroneously interpreted as the mathematical formulation of the trade - off relation of error and disturbance in quantum measurement , where @xmath5}}$ ] is the expectation value of @xmath6 over the quantum state @xmath7 , the square bracket denotes the commutator , and @xmath8 .",

    "however , the measurement process causes a non - unitary state change and decreases the information on the post - measurement state . since the information is conserved under the unitary process , it can characterize the non - unitary effects of the measurement process",

    "ozawa  @xcite discussed the measurement processes and defined the error and disturbance , and derive a trade - off relation . according to his trade - off relation , it is possible to construct the measurement scheme such that the product of the error and disturbance vanishes .",
    "however , this does not mean that we can obtain information about the observable without dicreasing the information about the canonically conjugate observable on the post - measurement state , since his definitions of the error and disturbance per se do not always give quantitative information concerning observables .    in this paper",

    "the non - unitary state change caused by the measurement process hinders us from estimating the expectation value of the conjugate observable .",
