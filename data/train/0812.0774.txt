    "although the rare - earth transition metal phosphide oxides @xmath1fepo , where @xmath1 is a lanthanide , were first synthesized in 1995 @xcite , it was not until 2006 @xcite that superconductivity near 5 k was discovered in lafepo .",
    "the subsequent report of superconducting critical temperature @xmath0  values near 26 k in the related , fluorine - doped compound lafeaso@xmath2f@xmath3 @xcite resulted in a great deal of excitement and many publications on what is now recognized as a new class of fe - based high temperature superconductors .",
    "several different types of doping have been found to induce superconductivity in these compounds including substituting f for o  @xcite , co for fe @xcite , sr for la @xcite , th for gd  @xcite , and also the introduction of oxygen vacancies @xcite .",
    "materials with related structures which include the same type of fe-@xmath4 planes such as ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath5as@xmath5 @xcite and lifeas @xcite have also been found to exhibit similar physics including relatively high temperature superconductivity .",
    "clearly , there exists an enormous phase space of potential fe-@xmath4 superconductors .",
    "the vast majority of work has focused on the arsenic - based versions of these compounds since , thus far , they exhibit the highest @xmath0  values , with the record high @xmath0  near 55 k for smfeaso@xmath2f@xmath3 @xcite and smfeaso@xmath6 @xcite , and 56 k for gd@xmath2th@xmath3feaso @xcite . given the toxic nature of arsenic , it would be highly desirable to discover similarly high @xmath0  values in less toxic p- , sb- , or bi - based versions of these compounds",
    ". however , despite the fact that replacing la with the lanthanides ce , pr , nd , sm , or gd in the as - based oxypnictides leads to a near doubling of @xmath0 , there appears to be a striking lack of data on the corresponding phosphorus based versions of these compounds .",
    "although lafepo has received substantial attention , smfepo was recently been reported to be superconducting @xcite , and cefepo remains non - superconducting down to 400 mk @xcite , the compounds @xmath1fepo with @xmath1 = pr , nd , and gd do not yet appear to have been scrutinized for the occurrence of superconductivity .    the undoped parent compounds , @xmath1feaso , exhibit a spin density wave ( sdw ) and structural instability near 150 k , remain metallic to low temperatures , and only display superconductivity when the sdw is suppressed towards zero temperature either through doping or pressure  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the phosphorus - based analogues lafepo and smfepo @xcite do not manifest a sdw transition and appear to develop a superconducting state in the undoped form at ambient pressure .",
    "three key questions are whether the mechanism of superconductivity is the same in the p- and as- based compounds , whether the p - based versions of these compounds indeed exhibit superconductivity in the undoped form or only in samples that are in fact of the form @xmath1fepo@xmath6 , and to what degree sample quality effects the superconducting properties .    for lafepo , values of @xmath0  that range from 3 k @xcite to 7 k @xcite have been reported . under pressure",
    ", we found that the @xmath0  of lafepo reaches nearly 14 k at @xmath7 kbar  @xcite .",
    "however , in a recent study of polycrystalline materials , it was concluded that stoichiometric lafepo is metallic but non - superconducting @xcite at temperatures as low as 0.35 k. our recent work on single crystalline lafepo @xcite indicated @xmath0  values near 6 k as measured by electrical resistivity and magnetization , but the specific heat exhibited no discontinuity at @xmath0  leading us to propose that the superconductivity may be associated with oxygen vacancies that alter the carrier concentration in a small fraction of the sample , although superconductivity characterized by an unusually small gap value could not be ruled - out . yet",
    ", the superconductivity appeared to be associated with the zrcusias structure , since the upper critical field was anisotropic .",
    "however , in a recent study of single crystals of lafepo @xcite , a specific heat anomaly roughly 60% of the expected bcs value in magnitude at the @xmath8 k was reported , indicating that the superconductivity can be a bulk phenomenon in this material .",
    "these samples were grown using a slightly different method than the one we have employed , where la@xmath5o@xmath9 was used as the oxygen containing precursor rather than fe@xmath5o@xmath9 , as used in our growths .",
    "the variation in the reported data indicate that the @xmath0  value and superconducting fraction are sensitive to the details of the synthesis conditions .    in this paper",
    ", we report the results of electrical resistivity , magnetic susceptibility , and specific heat measurements on single crystal samples of lafepo , prfepo , and ndfepo .",
    "all three compounds exhibit complete resistive superconducting transitions ; i.e. , the resistivity drops to a negligibly small value at low temperatures .",
    "however , as - grown crystals of prfepo and ndfepo do not show superconducting transitions in the magnetic susceptibility and magnetic screening only develops after post - annealing the samples in flowing o@xmath5 at 700 @xmath10c .",
    "annealing in flowing o@xmath5 at 700 @xmath10c for 24 hours is also found to improve the superconductive properties of lafepo .",
    "single crystals of lafepo , prfepo , and ndfepo were grown from elements and elemental oxides with purities @xmath11% in a molten sn : p flux .",
    "the growths took place over a 1 week period in quartz ampoules which were sealed with 75 torr ar at room temperature .",
    "the inner surface of each quartz ampoule was coated with carbon by a typical pyrolysis method .",
    "the starting materials were @xmath1 , fe@xmath5o@xmath9 , p , and sn , which were combined in the molar ratios 9:3:6:80.5 , similar to previous reports  @xcite for p - based oxypnictide single crystals .",
    "the fe@xmath5o@xmath9 powder was dried for @xmath12 hours at 300 @xmath10c before weighing .",
    "the ampoule was heated to 1135 @xmath10c at a rate of 35 @xmath10c / hr , kept at this temperature for 96 hours , and then rapidly cooled to 700 @xmath10c . after removing the majority of the flux by spinning the ampoules in a centrifuge , lafepo , prfepo , and ndfepo single crystal platelets of an isometric form with typical dimensions of @xmath13 mm@xmath14 or smaller ( particularly for the ndfepo crystals ) , were collected and cleaned in hydrochloric acid to remove the flux from the surface of the crystals prior to measurements . as previously reported  @xcite , the platelets cleaved easily in the @xmath15-plane and were notably malleable , in contrast to the cuprate superconductors . in order to explore the effects of annealing in oxygen",
    ", several batches of crystals were heated to 700 @xmath10c for 24 hours under flowing o@xmath5 .",
    "hereafter , these samples will be referred to as `` o@xmath5-annealed '' .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction measurements were made using a diffractometer with a non - monochromated cu k@xmath16 source to check the purity and crystal structure of the lafepo and prfepo single crystals .",
    "due to a small batch yield , x - ray diffraction measurements were not made for the ndfepo crystals . as reported previously , the crystals were difficult to grind into a fine powder as a result of their malleability .",
    "thus , the powder diffraction patterns for @xmath1 = la and pr crystals were generated from a collection of several crystals which were cut into small pieces using a razor blade and then ground into a coarse powder using a mortar and pestle .",
    "the xrd results revealed diffraction patterns that are consistent with those reported previously  @xcite .",
    "chemical analysis measurements were also made using an fei company model 600 scanning electron microscope which revealed that the stoichiometry for the crystals was consistent with the ratio 1:1:1:1 for @xmath1:fe : p : o where @xmath1 = la , pr , nd .    electrical resistivity @xmath17 measurements were performed in a four - wire configuration with the current in the @xmath15-plane , at temperatures @xmath18 @xmath19 1.1 - 300 k using a conventional @xmath20he cryostat and a quantum design physical properties measurement system ( ppms ) . due to the small size of the crystal samples and uncertainties in the placement of the leads , the absolute resistivity values are accurate only to @xmath21 .",
    "specific heat @xmath22 measurements were made for 2 - 300 k for lafepo and prfepo crystals in a quantum design ppms semiadiabatic calorimeter using a heat - pulse technique .",
    "the specimens for specific heat measurements were attached to a sapphire platform with a small amount of apiezon n grease and were composed of several hundred single crystals for which the mass m = 13.06 mg ( la unannealed ) , 8.93 mg ( pr unannealed ) , and 6.32 mg ( pr o@xmath5-annealed ) .",
    "dc magnetization @xmath23 measurements were made using a quantum design magnetic properties measurement system ( mpms ) in order to probe both the superconducting and normal state properties of the single crystal platelets . for the normal state measurements to room temperature ,",
    "the lafepo and prfepo specimens studied were the same as those used for specific heat measurements and were mounted in cotton packed gelatin capsules .",
    "for ndfepo , the normal state measurements were made using a single crystal ( @xmath24 = 0.0125 mg ) which was mounted on a piece of tape with the @xmath15-plane perpendicular to the applied magnetic field . to study the superconducting state ,",
    "individual single crystal specimens were mounted with the @xmath15-plane perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "multiple single crystal platelets were each individually measured for 2 - 10 k and @xmath25 oe under both zero field cooled ( zfc ) and field cooled ( fc ) conditions in order to characterize batch homogeneity via variation in @xmath0 , which was found to be minimal .",
    "the electrical resistivity data for unannealed @xmath1fepo ( @xmath1 = la , pr , and nd ) , shown in figure [ fig : rho ] , reveal metallic behavior where @xmath17 decreases with decreasing @xmath18 until the onset of the zero resistance state at the superconducting transition temperatures @xmath26 k , 3.2 k , and 3.1 k for @xmath1 = la , pr , and nd respectively .",

    "sample quality can be defined as either crystalline or chemical homogeneity , each of which has the potential to affect the physical properties in unique ways .",
    "it has been noted @xcite that among several samples of undoped lafepo , those with the lowest residual resistivities display the highest @xmath0  values . a correlation between low residual resistivity and high @xmath0  has also been observed in smfepo @xcite .",
    "this trend could derive from several possible differences among the samples , including lattice disorder , oxygen vacancy induced changes in the carrier density , or oxygen vacancy induced changes in the lattice parameters .",
    "our measurements for lafepo , prfepo , and ndfepo , which clearly show that o@xmath5-annealing promotes the superconducting state , suggest a correlation between sample quality and higher @xmath0  values .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : comparison ] for prfepo where electrical resistivity for unannealed samples , magnetization data for o@xmath5-annealed samples , and specific heat data for o@xmath5-annealed samples are compared .",
    "comparison of magnetization data for unannealed and o@xmath5-annealed samples also show that superconductivity is promoted by o@xmath5-annealing ( figure [ fig : chi_lowt ] ) .",
    "in general , annealing tends to improve crystalline quality by allowing disorder in the lattice to relax , in addition to reducing possible chemical inhomogeneity . on the other hand ,",
    "annealing can also promote phase separation .",
    "for this reason , although it seems reasonable to correlate crystalline quality with an enhancement of the superconducting state , it is still necessary to carry out a more systematic study of the effect of annealing in these compounds .",
    "furthermore , we note that it may be possible to improve the superconducting properties of the fe - as compounds by synthesizing high quality single crystal specimens .",
    "we have reported results for single crystals of the compounds lafepo , prfepo and ndfepo , which were prepared by means of a flux growth technique .",
    "measurements of electrical resistivity , magnetic susceptibility and specific heat reveal metallic behavior for unannealed samples , which evolves into a superconducting state at low @xmath18 in @xmath1 = la ( @xmath0 = 6.6 k ) , @xmath1 = pr ( @xmath0 = 3.2 k ) , and @xmath1 = nd ( @xmath0 = 3.1 k ) . the effect of annealing in flowing o@xmath5 at 700 @xmath10c for 24 hours was also studied and found to enhance the superconducting properties .",
    "although it seems likely that the positive effect of o@xmath5-annealing on the superconducting properties is due to improved crystallinity and chemical homogeneity , further research will be required to support this conclusion .",
    "finally , the evolution of @xmath0 with @xmath1 ion for the p- and as - based @xmath1fe@xmath4o compounds appears to be in opposite directions : @xmath0  increases as @xmath1 is varied from la to sm for @xmath4 = as and decreases as @xmath1 is varied from la to sm for @xmath4 = p. this suggests that the mechanism of the superconductivity in these two series of compounds may be different ; i.e. , the superconductivity may be unconventional for the arsenides and conventional for the phosphides .",

    "<S> single crystals of the compounds lafepo , prfepo , and ndfepo have been prepared by means of a flux growth technique and studied by electrical resistivity , magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that prfepo and ndfepo display superconductivity with values of the superconducting critical temperature @xmath0  of 3.2 k and 3.1 k , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of annealing on the properties of lafepo , prfepo , and ndfepo is also reported . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1fepo ( @xmath1 = lanthanide ) compounds are isostructural with the @xmath1feaso@xmath2f@xmath3 compounds that become superconducting with @xmath0  values as high as 55 k for @xmath1 = sm . </S>",
    "<S> a systematic comparison of the occurrence of superconductivity in the series @xmath1fepo and @xmath1feaso@xmath2f@xmath3 points to a possible difference in the origin of the superconductivity in these two series of compounds . </S>"
