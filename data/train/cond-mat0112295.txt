    "swt predicts a complete magnetic disordering of the @xmath25 spins ( @xmath91 ) starting at @xmath92 .",
    "the latter point exists in the swt for arbitrary spins @xmath24 and @xmath25@xcite and preceeds the classical spin - flop transition point ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the effect is strongly pronounced in the extreme quantum case @xmath71 where both the swt and the ed data predict @xmath93 .",
    "the extrapolated ccm data seem to show the same tendency .",
    "the steps in the ed data are due to finite - size effects and reflect the change in the total spin @xmath94 ( a good quantum number ) of the absolute ground state with the frustration parameter @xmath2 . for instance , in the ed data @xmath95 appears as a point where @xmath94 changes from @xmath96 to @xmath97 ( respectively , @xmath75 changes from @xmath98 to @xmath99 ) . although swt formally predicts @xmath100 even beyond @xmath95 , the latter region is not accessible ( for the standard swt ) as the phase with @xmath101 and @xmath102 does not appear in the classical phase diagram.@xcite we suggest that the point @xmath95 is just the new position of the quantum spin - flop transition ( see below ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that quantum fluctuations in the c phase do not change substantially the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath27 ( see figs .  [ mxmz ] and [ angle ] ) .",
    "finally , the mixed - spin collinear state has properties which are similar to those of the collinear phase in the antiferromagnetic @xmath1 model , i.e. , it is a nel - type magnetic state characterized by the on - site magnetizations @xmath103 .",
    "both the swt and the ccm predict that the on - site magnetization @xmath70 vanishes at a point ( @xmath104 ) which is very close to the classical spin - flop transition point .    the ed data for different spin - spin correlations ( fig .",
    "[ ss ] ) give some additional evidence in favor of the suggested phase diagram . here",
    "the phase transition point @xmath104 can be indicated as a point where the mixed - spin correlations ( being ferromagnetic in the n phase ) change their sign .",
    "we observe that close to the point @xmath104 the spin - spin correlations among the @xmath25 spins are small and also change their sign . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlations among the @xmath24 spins remain relatively large ( and antiferromagnetic , as in the n phase ) down to the point @xmath93 , where the singlet ground state disappears .",
    "thus , there are some indications that the established quantum spin phase ( @xmath105 ) has the symmetries of the canonical nel state composed entirely of @xmath24 spins ( i.e. , @xmath106 , @xmath91 ) . however , due to the finite - size effects in the ed data we can not exclude the spin - liquid state ( @xmath107 , @xmath91 ) as a possible ground state in the above region .",
    "further understanding of the proposed phase diagram may be achieved by studying the low - lying excitations in these magnetic phases .      in the f phase @xmath108 and the dispersion relations in eq .",
    "( [ sp ] ) are simplified to @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 .",

    "finally , the spin - wave spectrum in the mixed - spin collinear phase is given by the general relation ( [ sp ] ) , where @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 ( see fig .  [ en ] ) .",
    "as compared to the antiferromagnetic @xmath1 model , the excitation spectrum in the mixed - spin collinear phase shows some important peculiarities which specify the instability at the classical transition point @xmath23 .",
    "first , in the mixed - spin system the degeneracy of the spin - wave branches @xmath140 and @xmath141 is completely removed .",
    "second , the spin - wave excitations described by @xmath141 formally remain stable down to the point @xmath142 [ @xmath143 for the @xmath71 system ] .",
    "the phase transition at @xmath104 is entirely driven by instabilities in the lower @xmath140 excitation branch . at the classical spin - flop transition point ( @xmath23 ) , the branch @xmath140 exhibits two full lines of zero modes ( i.e. , @xmath144 and @xmath145 ) in the pbz .",
    "the soft lines are connected with _",
    "fluctuations in the @xmath146 and @xmath147 directions on the square lattice , so that we can expect that quantum fluctuations do not change the position of the classical transition point ( in accord with the data presented in fig .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the quantum spin phases in the mixed - spin @xmath1 heisenberg model defined on a square lattice .",
    "the reported results support a phase diagram with an additional quantum spin phase close to the classical spin - flop transition .",
    "in particular , in the extreme quantum case @xmath71 , we have found indications of a quantum spin phase ( in the region @xmath148 ) which is characterized by magnetically disordered @xmath25 spins and nel long - range ordered @xmath24 spins .",
    "the latter suggestion is based ( i ) on the analysis of the low - lying excitations showing that the mixed - spin collinear state survives at most down to the classical transition point @xmath149 and ( ii ) on the swt and ed results for the sublattice magnetization in the c phase @xmath70 : both methods predict that @xmath70 vanishes at a point ( @xmath150 ) preceeding the classical transition point @xmath23 .",
    "however , due to strong finite - size effects in the ed data and the qualitative character of the swt analysis , we can not exclude the spin - liquid state as a possible ground state in the above region .",
