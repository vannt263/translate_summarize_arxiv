    "interaction between a magnetized , rotating star and a surrounding accretion disk has been of continued interest since the discovery of x - ray pulsars in binary systems ( giacconi et al .",
    "1971 , etc ) .",
    "its solution may hold the key to understanding fundamental problems such as structure and dynamics of magnetized accretion disks , angular momentum exchange between the disk and the star , etc , in a variety of astrophysical systems , including cataclysmic variables , x - ray binaries , t tauri stars and active galactic nuclei . a detail model for the disk - star interaction",
    "was first developed by ghosh & lamb ( 1979a , 1979b ) , who argued that the stellar magnetic field penetrates the disk via kelvin - helmholtz instability , turbulent diffusion and reconnection , producing a broad transition zone joining the unperturbed disk flow far from the star to the magnetospheric flow near the star . the transition zone is composed of two qualitatively different regions , a broad outer zone where the angular velocity is nearly keplerian and a narrow inner zone or boundary layer where it departs significantly from the keplerian value . the total torque @xmath7 exerted on the star with mass @xmath8 is then divided into two separate components : n=+ , where the subscript represents the appropriate zone in the disk .",
    "the  material \" torque of the ( inner ) accretion flow is = ^2 , where @xmath9 is the angular velocity of disk plasma at the magnetospheric radius @xmath0 ( g is the gravitation constant ) , and @xmath10 is the accretion rate . here we have adopted cylindrical coordinate @xmath11 centered on the star and the disk is assumed to be located on the @xmath12 plane , which is perpendicular to the star s spin and magnetic axes .",
    "the torque in the outer zone supplied by the maxwell stress is given by = -_^r^2dr , where @xmath13 is the azimuthal field component generated by shear motion between the disk and the vertical field component @xmath14 .",
    "the torque @xmath15 can be positive and negative depending on the value of the  fastness parameter \" @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the angular velocity of the star and @xmath18 is the corotation radius .    inside the magnetospheric boundary",
    ", the magnetic stress dominates the rotation of disk plasma , and forces it to corotate with the magnetosphere at the radius @xmath1 . to understand",
    "how far the disk can extend into the stellar magnetosphere and how the torque is transferred to the star , it is necessary to obtain the solutions of the structure of the magnetosphere .",
    "ghosh & lamb ( 1979a ) suggested that @xmath0 and @xmath19 be constrained by the following relation ( r/4)_022(r)_0 ( the subscript 0 denotes quantities evaluated at @xmath20 ) , which follows the equation of angular momentum conservation , though contribution from gas funnel flow to angular momentum transfer has not been included .",
    "ghosh & lamb ( 1979a ) also assumed a priori that @xmath19 corresponds to the electromagnetic screening length , and is much smaller than @xmath0 . to testify the self - consistency of this assumption , from equation ( 4 ) we derive @xmath21 when @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the conventional alfven radius in spherical accretion . if @xmath24 as obtained by ghosh & lamb ( 1979a ) , then indeed @xmath25",
    "however , if @xmath26 as suggested by some recent investigations ( e.g. , arons 1993 ; ostriker & shu 1995 ; wang 1996 ; li 1997 ) , @xmath19 will be as large as @xmath0 .",
    "li , wickramasinghe & rdiger ( 1996 ) have presented a class of funnel flow solutions in which the angular momentum is carried by the matter .",
    "these authors argue that for an ideally conducting star , the stellar boundary condition requires the toroidal field be very small and most of the angular momentum of the matter in the funnel be propagated back to the disk rather to the star .",
    "li & wickramasinghe ( 1997 ) show that a consequence of this result is that the true inner disk radius @xmath1 could be much smaller than @xmath0 , with @xmath27 as low as @xmath28 in slow rotator case , and the values of the critical fastness parameter at which the net torque vanishes would also change .",
    "this  torqueless \" suggestion was criticized by wang ( 1997 ) , who points out that a small toroidal field is enough to produce a significant torque on the star , and that the viscous stress is unable to remove angular momentum back outwards from the inner edge of the accretion disk .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , based on wang s ( 1997 ) arguments , we calculate the lower limit of @xmath1 that is required for efficient angular momentum transfer , and find it to be at least @xmath29 , implying that @xmath0 is a good indicator of the inner edge of the disk . in section 3",
    "we discuss the possibility of inefficient angular momentum transfer , which is likely to occur in lmxbs , and the implications for the resulting variation in the fastness parameter .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "an estimation of @xmath0 can be obtained by setting the magnetic stress equal to the rate at which angular momentum is removed in the disk ( wang 1987 ) ( r^2)_0=[]_0 , where @xmath30 is the angular velocity of disk plasma . following li & wang ( 1996 ) , we assume that @xmath31 reaches its maximum at @xmath20 , i.e , @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , and rewrite equation ( 5 ) as = - .",
    "the torque @xmath34 in equation ( 1 ) in fact contains two components : the real material torque @xmath35 in the funnel flow , and the magnetospheric torque @xmath36 arising from the shearing motion between the corotating magnetosphere and the non - keplerian disk boundary layer , i.e. , @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "we first consider the second term on the righ - hand side of equation ( 7 ) . in estimating the toroidal magnetic filed @xmath13 , we assume as usual that @xmath13 is generated by the shearing between the disk and the stellar magnetosphere , and the growth of @xmath13 is limited by diffusive decay due to turbulent mixing within the disk ( e.g. , campbell 1992 ; yi 1995 ; wang 1995 ) .",
    "several different phenomenological descriptions of disk - magnetosphere interaction ( wang 1995 ) cause little practical differences to our conclusions . assuming that @xmath14 follows a dipolar field and using equations ( 6 ) and ( 8)",
    ", we may write the magnetospheric spin - up torque into dimensionless form as _ mag= = _ k^3/2^ [ 1-(/)]y^-3dy , where @xmath39 .    in the first term on the righ - hand side of equation ( 7 )",
    ", @xmath40 denotes the vertical mass loss rate from the boundary layer .",
    "this can be described by the equation ( e.g. , ghosh & lamb 1979a ) = 4rg(r ) , scaling the vertical flow velocity from the boundary layer in terms of the local sound speed @xmath41 and introducing a  gate \" function @xmath42 describing the radial profile of mass loss out of the boundary layer ( @xmath43 is the mass density ) . to keep things simple ,",
    "we assume @xmath44 outside @xmath0 , and @xmath45 when @xmath46 . assuming that the disk plasma around @xmath0 is thermally supported and optically thick to thomson scattering ( appropriate for a binary x - ray pulsar ) , from the @xmath47-disk model of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , we obtain @xmath48 or @xmath49 , which leads to _ f== _ k^()r . for generality ,",
    "we have also assumed @xmath50 , and found that the results do not change significantly .",
    "the value of @xmath51 can be obtained by setting @xmath52 . from equations ( 9 ) and ( 11 )",
    "it can be seen that the magnitude of @xmath51 depends on the detail profile of @xmath31 between @xmath1 and @xmath0 , which is unknown before solving the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) equations .",
    "a lower limit of @xmath51 , however , can be estimated in the following way . because of the steep radial dependence of the stellar magnetic field ( @xmath53 ) , the slope of the angular velocity @xmath54 should increase from 0 at @xmath0 to a large value at @xmath1 .",
    "this requires that , in the @xmath55 diagram ( figure 1a ) @xmath31 should always lie beyond the dashed line which represents a linear relation between @xmath56 and @xmath57 . as we know from equations ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) , the larger @xmath56 , the larger the @xmath58 , and the smaller the @xmath19 required .",
    "so the smallest @xmath51 corresponds to the extreme case that @xmath31 decreases linearly from @xmath59 to @xmath17 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , i.e. , ( r)=ar+b , where a= , and b=.    in figure 1b we plot the calculated values of @xmath51 as a function of the fastness parameter @xmath60 in the dashed curve .",
    "it is seen that @xmath51 naturally reaches 1 when @xmath61 , but remains @xmath62 within a large range of @xmath60 .",
    "the solid curves in figure 1a and 1b represent an example with more practical boundary conditions , which are always located above the dashed curves .",
    "our calculations in last section are based on the assumption that a torque of order @xmath63 can be efficiently transmited to the star by both the gas funnel flow and the magnetic stress .",
    "it has been suggested that ( shu et al .",
    "1994 ; ostriker & shu 1995 ; li , wickramasinghe , & rdiger 1996 ) a star may accrete matter from a magnetically truncated keplerian disk without experiencing any spin - up torque , because it would require the surface magnetic field to have a large azimuthal twist which would lead to dynamical instabilities .",
    "wang ( 1997 ) estimated the azimuthal pitch @xmath64 at the stellar surface required to transmit this torque to be ( ) ^3/2 , where the subscript asterisk denotes quantities at the stellar surface . since mhd instabilities are expected to occur only when @xmath65 , one sees that , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath64 could be much less than unity if @xmath68 .",
    "this condition is satisfied by binary x - ray pulsars , which generally possess surface magnetic fields as strong as @xmath69 g , and hence @xmath70 cm with the mass accretion rates of @xmath71 , much larger than @xmath72 cm .",
    "thus the standard accretion disk models based on ghosh & lamb ( 1979a , 1979b ) are suitable for these systems , and the value of the critical fastness parameter @xmath73 , according to wang ( 1995 ) and li & wang ( 1996 ) , may lie between @xmath74 and 0.95",
    ".    there could exist possibility of an accreting star unable to absorb the excess angular momentum at @xmath0 .",
    "this may occur in accreting neutron stars in lmxbs , in which the condition @xmath75 may not hold unless @xmath76 , because the surface field strengths in these neutron stars are so low ( @xmath77 g or lower ) that the accretion disk usually extends close to the star s surface , i.e. , @xmath78 . since mhd instabilies prevent transmission of the torque of @xmath34 , in this case the star only experiences the magnetic torque @xmath15 , and the critical fastness parameter decreases to @xmath79 ( li & wickramasinghe 1997 ) .",
    "note that the angular momentum of the material at @xmath0 can not be transported from the boundary layer to the outer parts of the disk by either viscous stress or a stellar magnetic field threading the inner region of the disk ( wang 1997 ) , it is more likely to be removed by a magnetocentrifugal wind . during wind mass loss ,",
    "some angular momentum of the star could also be lost , equivalent to an extra braking torque exerted on the star , so that the critical fastness parameter would be even smaller .",
    "observational evidence for the above arguments comes from kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) recently discovered with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) in some 16 neutron star lmxbs ( see van der klis 1997 for a review ) .",
    "these khz qpos are characterized by their high levels of coherence ( with quality factors @xmath80 up to @xmath81 ) , large rms amplitudes ( up to several @xmath82 ) , and wide span of frequencies ( @xmath83 hz ) , which , in most cases , are strongly correlated with x - ray fluxes . in many cases ,",
    "two simultaneous khz peaks are observed in the power spectra of the x - ray count rate variations , with the separation frequency roughly constant ( e.g. , strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; ford et al . 1997",
    "; wijnands et al .",
    "sometimes a third khz peak is detected in a few atoll sources during type i x - ray bursts at a frequency equal to the separation frequency of the two peaks ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; ford et al . 1997 ) or twice that ( wijnands & van der klis 1997 ; smith , morgan & bradt 1997 ) .",
    "this strongly suggests a beat - frequency interpretation , with the third peak at the neutron star spin frequency ( or twice that ) , the upper khz peak at the keplerian orbital frequency at a preferred radius around the neutron star , and the lower khz peak at the difference frequency between them . if the upper khz qpos are associated with the orbital frequency at the magnetospheric radius or the sonic point in the accretion disk ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; miller et al . 1998 ; see also lai 1998 ) , one would expect that the disk can extend towards the marginally stable orbit of a neutron star .    as pointed by zhang et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and white & zhang ( 1997 ) , these neutron stars may have accreted a considerable amount of mass , so they possibly have reached the equilibrium spin .",
    "the measured spin and qpo frequencies of these neutron stars reveal the critical fastness parameter @xmath73 lying between @xmath84 0.2 and 0.7 . additionally , considering the spin and orbital evolution in low - mass binary pulsars which are thought to originate from lmxbs , burderi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also found a small value of @xmath85 from the observed relation between spin period , magnetic field and orbital period .",
    "though subject to both observational and theoretical uncertainties , these results do indicate a smaller fastness parameter than predicted by current theory for binary x - ray pulsars .",
    "we summarize our results as follows : ( 1 ) the inner disk radius @xmath1 is always close to the magnetospheric radius @xmath0 . ( 2 ) for binary x - ray pulsars , the critical fastness parameter lies in the rang @xmath86 ; neutron stars in lmxbs may not absorb angular momentum flux at @xmath0 as efficiently as x - ray pulsars , resulting in a critical fastness parameter considerably smaller than in x - ray pulsars .",
