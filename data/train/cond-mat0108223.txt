    "the energy loss of non - relativistic charged particles entering a metal is primarily due to the creation of electron - hole pairs and collective excitations in the solid , interactions with the nuclei only becoming important when the velocity of the projectile is much smaller than the mean speed of the electrons in the solid@xcite .",
    "the degenerate interacting free electron gas ( feg ) provides a good model to describe a regime in which electrons are responsible for the energy - loss process .",
    "the inelastic decay rate and energy loss of charged particles in a feg have been calculated for many years in the first - born approximation or , equivalently , within linear response theory .",
    "it is well known that these first - order calculations predict an energy - loss that grows with the square of the projectile charge , @xmath0 , and provide a good approximation when the velocity of the projectile is much larger that the average velocity of the target electrons . however , when the velocity of the projectile decreases non - linearities become apparent .",
    "an important example is provided by the existing differences between the energy loss of protons and antiprotons@xcite , which can not be accounted for within linear - response theory .",
    "these differences were then successfully accounted on the basis of second - order perturbative calculations that used the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) and treated the moving charged particle as a prescribed source of energy and momentum.@xcite beyond - rpa calculations of this so - called @xmath1 effect have been reported only very recently , in the limit of low velocities.@xcite    in this paper , we report various many - body theoretical approaches to the quadratic decay rate and energy loss of charged particles moving in an interacting feg , which include exchange - correlation ( xc ) effects and treat the moving charged particle as part of the many - body interacting system .",
    "first of all , we present a fully quantum treatment of the probe particle , which we assume to be distinguishable from the electrons in the fermi gas .",
    "we assign a propagator to this particle , and then follow procedures of many - body perturbation theory to derive explicit expressions for the scattering matrix . from the knowledge of this matrix , both the decay rate and the energy loss of the moving particle can be evaluated either within the rpa or by including short - range xc effects .",
    "we also derive an explicit expression for the self - energy of the probe particle , which enables us to present an alternative derivation of the decay rate .",
