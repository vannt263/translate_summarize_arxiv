    "since its discovery at fermilab by the cdf collaboration  @xcite the @xmath0 meson has drawn a lot of attention .",
    "unlike other heavy mesons it is composed of two heavy quarks of different flavor ( @xmath1 ) and , being below the @xmath2@xmath3 threshold , it can only decay through weak interactions making an ideal system to study weak decays of heavy quarks .",
    "it is known  @xcite that one can not apply heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) to hadrons containing two heavy quarks : the kinetic energy term , needed in those systems to regulate infrared divergences , breaks heavy flavor symmetry .",
    "still , there is a symmetry that survives : heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) .",
    "this symmetry amounts to the decoupling of the two heavy quark spins since the spin ",
    "spin interaction vanishes for infinite heavy quark masses . using hqss jenkins _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite were able to obtain , in the infinite heavy quark mass limit , relations between different form factors for semileptonic @xmath0 decays into pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "contrary to the heavy - light meson case where standard hqs applies , no determination of corrections in inverse powers of the heavy quark masses has been worked out in this case .",
    "so one can only test any model calculation against hqss predictions in the infinite heavy quark mass limit .",
    "with both quarks being heavy , a nonrelativistic treatment of the @xmath0 meson should provide reliable results . besides a nonrelativistic model will comply with the constraints imposed by hqss as the spin ",
    "spin interaction vanish in the infinity heavy quark mass limit . in this paper",
    "we will study , within the framework of a nonrelativistic quark model , exclusive semileptonic and nonleptonic decays of the @xmath4 meson driven by a @xmath5 or @xmath6 transitions at the quark level .",
    "we will not consider semileptonic processes driven by the quark @xmath7 transition .",
    "our experience with this kind of processes , like the analogous @xmath8 semileptonic decay  @xcite , shows that the nonrelativistic model without any improvements underestimates the decay width for two reasons : first at high @xmath9 transfers one might need to include the exchange of a @xmath10 meson , and second the model underestimates the form factors at low @xmath9 or high three  momentum transfers .",
    "we will concentrate thus on semileptonic @xmath11 and @xmath12 transitions .",
    "as for two  meson nonleptonic decay we will only consider channels with a least a @xmath13 or @xmath14 final meson . in the first case",
    "we will include channels with final @xmath3 mesons for which there is a contribution coming from an effective @xmath15 transition . as later explained this is not the main contribution to the decay amplitude and besides the momentum transfer in those cases is neither too high nor too low so that the problems mentioned above are avoided .",
    "the observables studied here have been analyzed before in the context of different models like the relativistic constituent quark model  @xcite , the quasi - potential approach to the relativistic quark model  @xcite , the instantaneous nonrelativistic approach to the bethe ",

    "we will compare our results with those obtained in these latter references whenever is possible .",
    "besides , we will perform an exhaustive study and compile in this work all our results for exclusive semileptonic and nonleptonic @xmath4 decays , paying an special attention to the theoretical uncertainties affecting our predictions and providing reliable estimates for all of them .    in the present calculation we shall use physical masses taken from ref",
    ".  @xcite . for the @xmath0 meson mass and lifetime we shall use the central values of the recent experimental determinations by the cdf collaboration of @xmath16mev/@xmath17  @xcite and @xmath18s  @xcite .",
    "this new mass value is very close to the one we obtain with the different quark - quark potentials that we use in this work ( see below ) from where we get @xmath19mev .",
    "we shall also need cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements and different meson decay constants .",
    "for the former we shall use the ones quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite that we reproduce in table  [ tab : ckm ] .",

    "we have made a comprehensive and exhaustive study of exclusive semileptonic and nonleptonic two  meson decays of the @xmath0 meson within a nonrelativistic quark model .",
    "we have left out semileptonic processes involving a @xmath20 transition at the quark level to avoid known deficiencies both at high and low @xmath9 transfers  @xcite . for similar reasons we have only considered two  meson nonleptonic decay channels that include a @xmath13 or @xmath2 meson .",
    "our model respects hqss constraints in the infinite heavy quark mass limit but hints at sizeable corrections away from that limit for some form factors .",
    "unfortunately such corrections have not been worked out in perturbative qcd as they have for heavy ",
    "light mesons  @xcite .    to check the sensitivity of our results to the inter ",
    "quark interaction we have used five different quark ",
    "quark potentials .",
    "most observables change only at the level of a few per cent when changing the interaction .",
    "there is another source of theoretical uncertainty in the use of nonrelativistic kinematics in the evaluation of the orbital wave functions and the construction of our states in eq.([wf ] ) . while this is a very good approximation for the @xmath0 itself it is not necessarily so for mesons with a light quark .",
    "we nevertheless think that , to a certain extent , the ignored relativistic effects are contained in an effective way in the free parameters of the inter - quark interaction , which are fitted to experimental data .",
