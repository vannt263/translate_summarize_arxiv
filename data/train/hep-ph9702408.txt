    "recently , the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations at hera presented data on the differential cross section @xmath5 of inclusive @xmath0 production in low-@xmath6 collisions , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the rapidity and transverse momentum of the produced @xmath0 mesons in the laboratory frame , respectively .",
    "these measurements extended up to @xmath9  gev . these data were compared with next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd predictions in the so - called massless - charm scheme @xcite and good agreement was found .    in the massless - charm scheme ,",
    "the charm - quark mass @xmath10 is neglected , which should be a reasonable approximation for @xmath11 . in this approach",
    ", charm is considered to be one of the active flavours in the same way as the lighter @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 quarks .",
    "then , the collinear singularities corresponding to the @xmath15 terms in a scheme where the charm - quark mass is finite and only three active flavours are taken into account , are absorbed into the charm - quark parton density functions ( pdf s ) and into the fragmentation functions ( ff s ) of charm quarks into @xmath0 mesons .",
    "thus , in a nlo analysis , the following ingredients are needed : @xmath16 the hard - scattering cross sections for the direct- and resolved - photon processes calculated in the massless approximation ( @xmath17 ) with @xmath18 active flavours and with the initial- and final - state collinear singularities , including those of the charm quark , subtracted ; @xmath19 the pdf s of the proton and the resolved photon , where charm is treated as a light flavour ; @xmath20 the ff s characterizing the hadronization of the massless partons , including the charm quark , into @xmath0 mesons .",
    "( similarly , the bottom quark is treated as a massless parton above a certain threshold , leading to @xmath21 . )",
    "this massless approach was originally considered in @xcite as a possibility to make predictions for large-@xmath8 heavy - quark production , and it was first applied to the production of large-@xmath8 hadrons containing bottom quarks in @xmath22 collisions @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it was employed to study charm - quark production in @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath23 @xcite , and @xmath24 collisions @xcite .    in order to obtain definite predictions for @xmath0 production cross sections in the massless - charm scheme ,",
    "one obviously needs the pdf s of the charm quarks in the proton and the photon , which do not enter the massive calculation , as well as the ff s for @xmath0 mesons .",
    "both the pdf s and ff s are basically non - perturbative input and must be determined by experiment .",
    "this offers the possibility to use the data of @xmath0-photoproduction experiments in regions where the massless - charm approach is a good approximation , to obtain information on the charm pdf s of the proton and the photon and on the ff s of the quarks , in particular the charm quark , and the gluon into @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the ff s of the @xmath0 mesons can be determined from measured cross sections of @xmath0 production in @xmath1 annihilation . in these experiments ,",
    "the centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy @xmath25 of the electron - positron system is large compared to @xmath10 , so that the massless - charm approach is well justified in this case .",
    "then , one is left with the task of constraining the charm components of the proton and the photon .",
    "the photon pdf s enter , for instance , the resolved - photon cross section of inclusive @xmath0 photoproduction in @xmath4 collisions . in a previous work by two of us with spira @xcite",
    ", it was found that , at moderate @xmath8 , the resolved - photon cross section is of the same order of magnitude as the direct - photon cross section .",
    "furthermore , the additional charm component in the proton turned out to only contribute marginally to the cross section of inclusive @xmath0 photoproduction .",
    "therefore , the study of this cross section offers an ideal possibility to specifically learn about the charm component of the photon , on which not very much is known from other experiments .",
    "the traditional place to investigate the charm pdf of the photon has been fully inclusive deep inelastic charmed - hadron production in @xmath26 collisions . unfortunately ,",
    "very little is known experimentally so far @xcite .",
    "several nlo parameterizations of the charm component of the photon exist in the literature @xcite , and we shall use them for our predictions in the following .",
    "the point to be made is that these charm pdf s have not yet really been tested against experimental data which are particularly sensitive to it .    in the previous work on @xmath0 production @xcite",
    ", we considered several approximations for the fragmentation of charm quarks into @xmath0 mesons , including also the @xmath6 evolution to higher scales .",
    "the most realistic description was by the peterson ff @xcite with evolution , which was also used for the comparison with the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite data .",
    "apart from the overall normalization , the distribution of peterson et al .",
    ", which is used as input at the starting scale @xmath27 , depends only on one parameter , @xmath2 .",
    "the value of @xmath2 was taken from the work by chrin @xcite , which is a phenomenological analysis of data on charmed - meson production ( not necessarily restricted to @xmath0 production ) in the petra - pep energy range of @xmath1 annihilation . in the meantime ,",
    "much better data , specifically on @xmath0 production , have been made available by the aleph @xcite and opal @xcite collaborations at lep1 .",
    "these data should give us an excellent handle on the @xmath0 ff s , so that we need not rely on chrin s value for the @xmath2 parameter any more .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to improve the description of the charm and bottom ff s into @xmath0 mesons by fitting to the aleph and opal data on the basis of nlo evolution equations .",
    "these ff s will be tested against @xmath0 production data at lower cm energies @xcite coming from petra @xcite , pep @xcite , and doris @xcite .",
    "they will also be used to make theoretical predictions for inclusive @xmath0 photoproduction at hera , following the earlier work @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  2",
    ", we shall briefly describe the nlo formalism of charm - quark fragmentation including the transition from massless to massive factorization of final - state collinear singularities also employed in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we shall specify the @xmath0 ff s at the starting scale @xmath27 , adopting two different functional forms .",
    "we shall consider not only charm - quark fragmentation , but also bottom - quark fragmentation which is needed to describe the lep1 data .",
    "finally , we shall present the resulting nlo predictions for @xmath0 production in @xmath1 annihilation and compare them with data from aleph and opal used in the fits , and with the other @xmath1 data at lower cm energies . in section  3",
    ", we shall confront our predictions for @xmath28 based on the two forms of ff s with the zeus data @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  4 .",
    "to construct lo and nlo sets of ff s for @xmath0 mesons , we make use of the new lep1 data from aleph @xcite and opal @xcite . in hadronic",
    "@xmath29-boson decays , charmed mesons are expected to be produced either directly through the hadronization of charm quarks in the process @xmath30 or via the weak decays of @xmath31 hadrons produced in @xmath32 , with an approximately equal rate .",
    "charmed mesons from @xmath30 allow us to measure the charm - quark ff .",
    "the main task of both experimental analyses was to disentangle these two main sources of @xmath0 production at the @xmath29-boson resonance .",
    "in the two papers @xcite , a number of different techniques are used to tag @xmath0 mesons from @xmath31 decay .",
    "the @xmath0 mesons are reconstructed in the decay chain @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which allows for a particularly clean signal reconstruction .",
    "the results of the two measurements are separate , differential yields for @xmath0 mesons from @xmath35 and @xmath36 decays , normalized to the total number of multihadronic @xmath29-boson decays , as a function of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the measured energy of the @xmath0 candidate .",
    "the contribution due to charm - quark fragmentation is peaked at large @xmath39 , whereas the one due to bottom - quark fragmentation has its maximum at small @xmath39 . for the fitting procedure ,",
    "we use the @xmath39 bins contained within the interval @xmath40 $ ] and integrate the theoretical functions over the bin widths , which is equivalent to the experimental binning procedure . as in the experimental analyses , we sum over @xmath41 and @xmath42 mesons . as a consequence ,",
    "there is no difference between the ff s of a given quark and its antiquark .",
    "we take the starting scales for the @xmath0 ff s of the gluon and the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath43 quarks and antiquarks to be @xmath44 , while we take @xmath45 in the case of bottom .",
    "the ff s of the gluon and the first three flavours are assumed to be zero at the starting scale .",
    "these ff s are generated through the @xmath46 evolution , and the ff s of the first three quarks and antiquarks coincide with each other at all scales @xmath47 .",
    "for the parameterization of the charm- and bottom - quark ff s at their respective starting scales , we employ two different forms :    @xmath16 in our standard set ( s ) , the ff s of the charm and bottom quarks are both assumed to be of a form usually used for the ff s of light hadrons , namely , @xmath48 where @xmath49 . here and in the following",
    ", we skip the index @xmath0 , since we only consider @xmath0 production throughout this paper , e.g. , @xmath50 denotes the ff of the charm quark into @xmath0 mesons , etc .",
    "@xmath19 in the so - called mixed set ( m ) , we use for the bottom - quark ff the form of ( [ standard ] ) and for the charm - quark ff the peterson distribution @xcite , @xmath51 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] the peterson form is particularly suitable to describe ff s that peak at large @xmath39 . since the bottom - quark ff has its maximum at smaller @xmath39 values , we obtain intolerably bad fits if we also use ( [ peterson ] ) in the case of bottom .",
    "this is the reason for choosing the bottom - quark ff at @xmath45 in set m to be of form  ( [ standard ] ) .",
    "obviously , the functional form  ( [ standard ] ) has more flexibility , since , apart from the normalization factor @xmath52 , it depends on two parameters , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , whereas there is just a single parameter , @xmath2 , in the peterson distribution .    the cross section of inclusive @xmath0 production in @xmath1 annihilation , @xmath55 is calculated from the same formula as for any other hadron , @xmath56 here , the sum extends over all active partons ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath47 is the renormalization scale of the partonic subprocesses , and @xmath58 is the fragmentation scale . at nlo , @xmath58 defines the point where the divergence associated with collinear radiation off parton @xmath59 is to be subtracted .",
    "this applies to the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 quarks as well as for the @xmath43 and @xmath60 quarks , the masses of which are neglected . to nlo in the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath61 )",

    "up to this point , the formalism is identical to the one for describing the fragmentation into light hadrons based on the @xmath61 factorization scheme . for the fragmentation into heavy particles ,",
    "we take one further step . as in the previous work @xcite ,",
    "we adjust the factorization of the final - state collinear singularities associated with the charm and bottom quarks in such a way that it matches the massive calculation .",

    "the same substitutions must also be performed in any massless hard - scattering cross sections that are to be convoluted with our ff s , in particular with those of inclusive particle production in @xmath4 collisions , which will be studied in the next section .",
    "this change of factorization must be regarded in connection with our assumptions concerning the ff s at the input scale , which refer to massive charm and bottom quarks .",
    "this means that , without this change , we would proceed as in the case of fragmentation into light hadrons and obtain somewhat different parameters for the input distributions .",
    "the ff s in ( [ sigx ] ) are parameterized at the starting scale @xmath79 by the anstze ( [ peterson ] ) and/or ( [ standard ] ) , depending on whether set m or s is considered .",
    "once we know the ff s at the scale @xmath27 , the @xmath46 evolution is ruled by the altarelli - parisi ( ap ) equations @xcite .",
    "our task is thus to determine the parameters of the distributions ( [ standard ] ) and ( [ peterson ] ) at the starting scale @xmath27 in such a way that the evolved ff s , when convoluted with the hard - scattering cross sections , fit the aleph @xcite and opal @xcite data at @xmath80 . in the case of form  ( [ standard ] ) , the ap equations can be easily solved with the help of the mellin - transform technique , since the moments of the starting distribution  ( [ standard ] ) are simple .",
    "further details are given , for example , in our earlier work  @xcite .",
    "in the case of the peterson form  ( [ peterson ] ) , the computation of the moments in mellin space is numerically rather complicated ; see @xcite for the corresponding formulae .",
    "in this case , we find it more convenient to perform the evolution of the ff s in @xmath39 space by iteratively solving the ap equations in their integral form , @xmath81 where @xmath82 . the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ ap ] ) is the distribution at the starting scale @xmath27 . as a check for the numerical stability of our procedure , we compared both methods of evolution at lo and nlo for forms ( [ standard ] ) and ( [ peterson ] ) , and found good agreement .",
    "the nlo timelike splitting functions @xmath83 , which enter ( [ ap ] ) , may be extracted from the literature @xcite . since , to our knowledge",
    ", there is no reference where all these functions are presented in a convenient form , i.e. , with the coefficients of the delta functions and plus distributions explicitly displayed , we collect them in the appendix .    in the case of set s",
    ", we need to fit @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 in ( [ standard ] ) for the charm- and bottom - quark ff s , while , in the case of set m , we need to determine these parameters for the bottom - quark ff as well as @xmath52 and @xmath2 in ( [ peterson ] ) for the charm - quark ff .",
    "both aleph @xcite and opal @xcite extracted the total @xmath0 momentum distribution as well as the individual contributions due to the @xmath84 and @xmath36 channels . in the case of aleph",
    ", we received the individual @xmath85 and @xmath86 data sets in numerical form via private communication @xcite . in the aleph analysis , the branching ratio of @xmath34 ( or the charge - conjugated final state ) was taken to be 0.0371 .",
    "since this value has been superseded by the value 0.041 @xcite , which was also used in the opal analysis , we rescale the aleph data with the factor 0.9049 . in our lo ( nlo ) analysis",

    "the value @xmath87  mev of our lo fit may seem unrealistically low ; this is , however , inconsequential because a higher value can easily be accommodated by slightly modifying the other fit parameters without damaging the quality of the fit .",
    "the starting scales are chosen to be @xmath44 with @xmath88  gev for all ff s except for the case of bottom , where it is taken to be @xmath45 with @xmath89  gev .",

    "the parameters of the bottom - quark ff s of sets s and m are very similar , i.e. , the data fix the charm- and bottom - quark ff s independently of each other .    in figs .",

    "the lo and nlo curves are very similar . at small @xmath39",
    ", we observe large differences between lo and nlo , indicating that , in this region , the perturbative treatment ceases to be valid . in this region ,",
    "also the massless approximation is not valid anymore .",
    "this may be understood by regarding the phase - space boundary for the production of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "since @xmath0 mesons have mass @xmath92  gev @xcite , they can only be produced for @xmath93 . at @xmath94 ,",
    "one has @xmath95 .",
    "this is just the region where our nlo results turn negative .",
    "therefore , our results are meaningful only for @xmath96 .",
    "consequently , we exclude the first bin of the opal data ( @xmath97 ) from our analysis . note that this phase - space boundary is not only theoretically motivated , but does also turn up in the measurements , which give values",
    "consistent with zero whenever @xmath98 .",
    "this is not only true for the opal data , but also for data taken at lower energies , e.g. , those from argus @xcite .    in figs .",
    "[ aleph]a , b and [ opal]a , b , we have plotted the fully normalized cross section of ( [ sigx ] ) , which also includes the gluon contributions in nlo .",
    "the shown charm and bottom contributions include terms with @xmath99 and @xmath100 in ( [ sigx ] ) , respectively , as well as the term with @xmath101 distributed to the charm and bottom terms in proportion to @xmath102 , which is motivated by ( [ xsection ] ) .",
    "the contributions from @xmath103 are negligible in size ; they add up to less than 2% of the total integrated cross section and mostly contribute at small @xmath39 .",
    "this procedure approximately produces the quantities that should be compared with the aleph and opal data . for the time being , we ignore the effect of electromagnetic initial - state radiation , which has not been corrected for in the data .    the quality of the fit is measured in terms of the average @xmath104 for all selected data points . in table",
    "[ fit ] , we list the @xmath104 values obtained with sets s and m at lo and nlo for the aleph and opal data , and their combination .",
    "we also specify the individual results for the @xmath84 and @xmath36 samples of aleph and opal .",
    "we observe that the @xmath84 samples yield worse @xmath104 values than the @xmath36 samples .",
    "the opal data tend to give better @xmath104 values than the aleph data . especially in the case of aleph , set",
    "s leads to better @xmath104 values than set m , which is not surprising if one recalls that set s has six degrees of freedom while set m has only five .",
    "the integrals of the charm- and bottom - quark ff s into @xmath0 mesons over @xmath39 give the branching fractions of these transitions .",
    "for the reasons given above , we restrict our considerations to the region @xmath105 , with @xmath106 , and define @xmath107 where @xmath49 . experimentally , the contribution from the omitted region @xmath108 is close to zero with a large error .",
    "it is interesting to study @xmath109 for @xmath49 at threshold @xmath110 and at the @xmath29-boson resonance @xmath111 . in table",
    "[ branching ] , we present the results for sets s and m at lo and nlo .",
    "we observe that these branching fractions are changed very little through the evolution from @xmath112 to @xmath113 , and they are almost equal for charm- and bottom - quark fragmentation .",
    "the branching fractions at the @xmath29-boson resonance can be compared with the experimental numbers reported by the opal collaboration @xcite , which are @xmath114 and @xmath115 , with errors of approximately 25% .",
    "these results , which are obtained from independent fits to all experimental data , are consistent with our fits . at lo ( nlo ) ,",
    "the charm to bottom ratio of the branching fractions at @xmath111 is 0.92 ( 0.94 ) for set s and 1.07 ( 1.01 ) for set m. this agrees well with the experimental results @xmath116 @xcite and @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "another quantity of interest is the mean momentum fraction , @xmath118 where @xmath49 . in table",

    "our results for @xmath123 should be compared with the experimental numbers reported by aleph @xcite and opal @xcite , @xmath124 respectively .",
    "we conclude that our fits are in reasonable agreement with the independent determinations in @xcite .",
    "next , we test whether the ff s constructed from the aleph and opal data , after evolution to lower scales , lead to predictions for @xmath0 production by @xmath1 annihilation that are consistent with experimental data taken at lower cm energies .",
    "a number of measurements at lower energies were performed , e.g. , at doris , cesr , pep , and petra ; for a compilation , see @xcite .",
    "these data have much lower statistics than the data from lep1 . for the comparison",
    ", we selected the data from argus @xcite at @xmath125  gev , from hrs @xcite at @xmath126  gev , and from tasso @xcite at @xmath127  gev .",
    "the tasso collaboration measured two decay channels of the @xmath128 meson , namely , @xmath129 and @xmath34 .",
    "the latter decay channel also allowed measurements at lower values of @xmath39 ; we shall denote this data set by tasso  2 and the other one by tasso  1 . for consistency",
    ", we corrected the hrs and tasso data by updating the values of the branching ratios of @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath129 according to the 1994 tables of the particle data group @xcite , which were also used by opal @xcite .",
    "this leads to correction factors of 0.702 for tasso  1 and 0.677 for tasso  2 . in the publication by hrs @xcite",

    "[ comp ] , the agreement between our predictions and the data is satisfactory .",
    "this nicely demonstrates that the data indeed exhibit the scaling violation predicted on the basis of the lo and nlo ap evolution equations for the ff s .",
    "in fact , the change in the shape of the differential cross section with @xmath46 is mainly due to the bottom quark .",
    "the argus data @xcite are taken off the resonance , at @xmath125  gev , where the bottom quark is not yet active .",
    "the inclusion of the bottom - quark contribution leads to a softening of the distribution , as may be seen in the case of the hrs data @xcite at @xmath126  gev and the tasso data @xcite at @xmath127  gev .",
    "the evolution from 29  gev to 34.2  gev has no discernible effect .",
    "going to the @xmath29-boson pole at @xmath136  gev further increases the relative importance of the bottom - quark fragmentation and leads to an even softer spectrum . for @xmath137 ,",

    "we adopt these kinematic conditions in our analysis .",
    "we work at nlo in the @xmath61 scheme with @xmath18 flavours . for the proton and photon pdf s",
    "we use set cteq4 m @xcite with @xmath146  mev and set grv  ho @xcite converted to the @xmath61 factorization scheme , respectively .",
    "we evaluate @xmath147 from the two - loop formula with this value of @xmath148 .",
    "the @xmath148 values implemented in the @xmath0 ff s and photon pdf s are 352  mev , which corresponds to the value @xmath149  mev quoted in the previous section , and 200  mev , respectively .",

    "we choose the renormalization and factorization scales to be @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively , where @xmath152 is the @xmath0 transverse mass .",
    "whenever we present lo results , these are consistently computed using set cteq4l @xcite of proton pdf s , set grv  lo @xcite of photon pdf s , the lo versions of our sets s and m of @xmath0 ff s , the one - loop formula for @xmath70 with @xmath153  mev , and the lo hard - scattering cross section .",
    "the photoproduction cross section is a superposition of the direct- and resolved - photon contributions . in our nlo analysis",
    ", the resolved - photon contribution is larger than the direct one for moderate @xmath8 .",
    "this statement depends , however , on the factorization scheme ; only the sum of both contributions is a physical observable and can be compared with experimental data .",
    "the bulk of the resolved - photon cross section is due to the charm component of the photon pdf @xcite .",
    "we first consider the @xmath8 distribution @xmath154 integrated over the rapidity interval @xmath155 as in the zeus analysis @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ zeus]a , we compare the respective zeus data @xcite with our lo and nlo predictions based on sets s and m. the theoretical results are multiplied with the factor 1.06 to account for the fact that opal @xcite used the @xmath0 and @xmath128 branching fractions of @xcite , while zeus @xcite used those of @xcite .",
    "the nlo distributions fall off slightly less strongly with increasing @xmath8 than the lo ones .",
    "it is remarkable that there is hardly any difference between the set - s and set - m results ; in fact , the lo - s and lo - m ( nlo - s and nlo - m ) curves almost coincide .",
    "this means that the details of charm - quark fragmentation are very tightly constrained by the lep1 data , and that the considered variation in the functional form of the charm - quark ff at the starting scale has very little influence on the @xmath8 distribution .",
    "the nlo curves should be compared with fig .",
    "8c in @xcite , where the charm - quark ff at the starting scale @xmath156  gev was taken to be of the peterson form with @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath159 .",
    "we recall that , in the case of set nlo  m , we have @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 ; see tables  [ pars ] and [ branching ] .",
    "we observe that the result for @xmath163 in fig .",
    "8c of @xcite is somewhat smaller than the nlo results of fig .  [ zeus]a , but has a similar shape .",
    "the agreement with the data is good , even at small @xmath8 , where the massless approach ceases to be valid .    in fig .",
    "[ zeus]b , we compare the @xmath7 line shape of @xmath5 , integrated over the @xmath8 interval 3  gev@xmath164  gev , with the respective zeus data points @xcite . as in fig .  [ zeus]a , we consider the four cases lo  s , nlo  s , lo  m , and nlo  m. again , the lo - s ( nlo - s ) results almost perfectly coincide with the lo - m ( nlo - m ) results , i.e. , the functional form of the charm - quark ff at the starting scale is of minor significance .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is reasonable . if we compare the nlo results of fig .",
    "[ zeus]b with the result for @xmath163 in fig .",
    "9c of @xcite , we see that the latter is somewhat smaller , but has essentially the same shape .    in @xcite , the cross section @xmath5",
    "was also measured at three different values of @xmath165 . to this end",
    ", @xmath7 and @xmath8 were sampled in the intervals @xmath155 and 3  gev@xmath164  gev , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ zeus]c , we show the @xmath165 dependence of @xmath5 , integrated over these @xmath7 and @xmath8 intervals , and compare it with the corresponding zeus data @xcite . similarly to figs .",
    "[ zeus]a and b , we consider sets s and m at lo and nlo . within the rather large experimental errors ,",
    "all four predictions agree reasonably well with the data . in @xcite ,",
    "such a figure was not presented , but it can be found in the zeus publication @xcite .",
    "again , we observe that the input assumptions , encoded in sets s and m , have practically no influence on the result .    when we fitted to the lep1 data , we also had to take into account @xmath0 production by bottom - quark fragmentation , as it gives a sizeable contribution at the @xmath29-boson pole . in @xmath4 collisions , however , the bottom quark does not contribute at all to inclusive @xmath0 photoproduction below the threshold at @xmath166 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath1 annihilation , the bottom quark does not contribute significantly even above the threshold . to elucidate this point",
    ", we repeat the analysis of fig .",
    "[ zeus]a for @xmath21 with and without the bottom - quark ff and plot the ratio in fig",
    ".  [ ratio ] .",
    "we see that , in all four cases , the relative contributions due to the bottom - quark ff s are below 5% and decrease with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "this may be understood by observing that , in the case of @xmath0 photoproduction in @xmath4 collisions , the main contribution to the cross section arises at large @xmath39 , typically at @xmath167 , where @xmath168 because the bottom - quark ff s have a soft spectrum .",
    "for the same reason , also the contributions of the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 quarks are negligible .",
    "we have seen that our theoretical predictions for @xmath0 photoproduction at hera are very insensitive to the specific form of the input distribution of the charm - quark ff , and that the influence of the other quark flavours is marginal .",
    "when the ff templates of sets s or m are fitted to the most accurate data , we obtain an almost unique prediction for the charm - quark ff .",
    "in fact , the largest remaining uncertainty in the calculation of the @xmath0 photoproduction cross section is related to the charm content of the resolved photon .",
    "this offers us the possibility to employ our well constrained ff s to extract information about the charm distribution in the photon .",
    "it is well known that the most sensitive distributions to study such dependences are those differential in rapidity .",
    "this fact has been previously exploited , e.g. , in @xcite , where we emphasized the potential to determine the gluon pdf of the photon by accurately measuring the inclusive charged - particle rapidity spectrum in photoproduction . to illustrate the sensitivity to the charm pdf of the photon , we repeat the nlo - s analysis of fig .",
    "[ zeus]b with this pdf switched off , and compare the outcome with the full calculation in fig .  [ charm ] . for comparison ,",
    "also the direct - photon contribution is shown .",
    "we observe that 73% to 100% ( 50% to 89% ) of the resolved - photon ( full ) cross section is induced by the charm content of the photon , which is most important in the backward direction .    inspired by this observation",
    ", we now repeat the nlo - s analysis of fig .",
    "[ zeus]b using in turn the nlo photon pdf sets of @xcite , which we denote by gs  ho and acfgp , respectively .",
    "the authors of @xcite considered both massless and massive charm quarks . in their massive - charm set",
    ", the charm - quark pdf is implemented with the boundary condition of @xcite at threshold .",
    "we observe a significant variation of the cross section , especially in the backward region , where our predictions for set grv  ho @xcite and acfgp ( massive @xmath43 ) @xcite differ by more than a factor of two !",
    "unfortunately , the data are not yet accurate enough to rule out any of the available sets . of course , in order to reliably constrain the charm pdf of the photon , it would be preferable to have data with an increased low-@xmath8 cut , since our massless charm - quark theory is more reliable in the large-@xmath8 region",
    ". however , this is a very interesting measurement that has a vast potential for improving our knowledge about the charm pdf of the photon .",
    "in this paper , we determined new sets of @xmath0 ff s at lo and nlo from fits to precise cross - section data obtained in @xmath1 annihilation by aleph and opal at lep1 .",
    "our analysis was based on the massless - charm factorization approach recently developed in @xcite . in these lep1 data ,",
    "the fragmentation of charm and bottom quarks into @xmath0 mesons was disentangled , so that the respective ff s are separately constrained . for the description at the charm - quark ff , we used two different anstze at the starting scale , namely , the three - parameter standard form conventionally used for light - meson production and the two - parameter peterson form .",
    "it turned out that both prescriptions lead to excellent fits of the lep1 data , and that the charm- and bottom - quark ff s are each tightly constrained . with this method ,",
    "the fragmentation at any other scale is predictable via the ap evolution , which we performed both at lo and nlo .",
    "this enabled us to check our ff s against @xmath1 data at lower cm energies .",
    "in particular , we found very good agreement with data from tasso @xcite , hrs @xcite , and argus @xcite , which demonstrates that the scaling violation encoded in the ap equations is consistent with the data .",
    "we stress that the results for the starting parameters are correlated with the starting scale . in the case of the peterson description for charm - quark fragmentation at lo ( nlo )",
    ", the epsilon parameter and @xmath3 branching fraction at the starting scale @xmath44 were found to be @xmath169 ( 0.0204 ) and @xmath170 ( 0.232 ) , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to an @xmath39 mean value of @xmath171 ( 0.754 ) .",
    "while @xmath172 is relatively stable under evolution to @xmath111 , @xmath121 is appreciably lowered , down to @xmath173 ( 0.556 ) .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath0 ff s thus obtained are universal and may be used to make predictions for inclusive @xmath0 production in any other high - energy experiment .",
    "we exploited this fact by calculating the cross section of inclusive @xmath0 photoproduction at hera , which we compared with the latest data from the zeus collaboration .",
    "we found that the bottom - quark contribution is marginal , and that the results do not depend on whether we use the standard or peterson - type charm - quark ff s , which shows that we have good control over the fragmentation aspect of @xmath0 photoproduction . under the condition that more precise experimental data , in particular in the large-@xmath8 region , will be collected at hera",
    ", this will allow one to constrain other non - perturbative input information such as the charm - quark pdf of the photon , which is still poorly known .",
    "* note added in proofs *    after the completion of our manuscript , a related paper @xcite has appeared .",
    "the authors of @xcite determine @xmath0 ff s by separately fitting @xmath1 data from doris and lep1 .",
    "in contrast to our procedure , they also include the @xmath174 functions of ( [ dij ] ) in the evolution , and treat the bottom quark on the same footing as the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 quarks , i.e. , they only take the charm - quark ff to be non - vanishing at the starting scale .    *",
