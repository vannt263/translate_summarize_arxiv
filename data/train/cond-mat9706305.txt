    "the widom rowlinson ( wr ) model , introduced in 1970  @xcite as an ingeniously simple model for the study of phase transitions in continuum fluids ( for an overview see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , continues to be , like its authors , a rich source of insights and analytical results in many ( sometimes quite unexpected ) areas  @xcite of statistical mechanics . in this paper , dedicated with great pleasure to ben widom on the occasion of his seventieth birthday",
    ", we continue our study of a variation of the original model from two to @xmath0 components on a lattice : hard core exclusion between particles of different species on nearest neighbor sites .",
    "this model was first considered by runnels and lebowitz  @xcite who proved that when the number of components @xmath0 is larger than some minimum @xmath11 then the transition from the gas phase at small values of @xmath1 to the demixed phase at large values of @xmath1 does not take place directly .",
    "instead there is , at intermediate values of @xmath1 , @xmath12 , an ordered phase in which one of the sublattices ( even or odd ) is preferentially occupied , i.e.  there is a crystalline ( antiferromagnetically ordered ) phase in which the average particle density on the even and odd sublattices , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are unequal .",
    "the average density , @xmath15 , of species @xmath16 , on each sublattice is the same for each @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the nature of the symmetry breaking is thus very different from that in the demixed phase at @xmath20 where @xmath21 but there exists one species , say @xmath22 , for which @xmath23 .",
    "the origin of this crystalline phase is purely entropic . for @xmath1",
    "fixed and @xmath0 large `` it pays '' for the system `` entropy wise '' to occupy just one sublattice without any constraint ; since there are no interactions between particles on the same sublattice there are @xmath0 independent choices at each site if we keep one of the sublattices empty . this more than compensates , at some @xmath24 , for the `` loss '' of `` fugacity energy '' occasioned by keeping down the density in one of the sublattices .",
    "a natural question now arises , just how big does @xmath11 have to be to see this ordered phase for @xmath25 .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that on the square lattice @xmath26 ; a ridiculously large upper bound . on the other hand a direct computation on the bethe lattice  @xcite with @xmath27neighbors gives @xmath28 ^ 2 $ ] , which would suggest @xmath29 for the square lattice , @xmath30 for the cubic and @xmath31 for the bcc lattice .",
    "now it can be shown , using fkg inequalities , that @xmath32 on any bipartite lattice  @xcite , but beyond that we have no simple or convincing argument for finding @xmath11 .",
    "we therefore turned to monte carlo simulations .",
    "this gave on the square lattice @xmath33",
    "@xcite which is only about twice as large as the bethe lattice prediction .",
    "this wetted our appetite to try the bcc lattice where @xmath34 .",
    "to our surprise we find here , using monte carlo simulations , that @xmath11 does indeed equal @xmath35 , on the bcc lattice .",
    "while we have no clue of how to find rigorously the actual value of @xmath11 or of @xmath3 , it was argued in  @xcite that for a given @xmath1 and @xmath0 large enough , the typical occupancy pattern on the lattice ( ignoring the label @xmath17 of the particles ) should be like that of a one component lattice gas with nearest neighbor hard core exclusion .",
    "for the latter system dobrushin  @xcite proved the existence of a crystalline state .",
    "this implies that @xmath3 should behave for large @xmath0 as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the critical fugacity at which the one component hard cube gas ( occupation at a site @xmath38 excludes occupation at all eight neighboring sites ) crystalizes .",
    "the value of @xmath37 for the bcc lattice , obtained by gaunt  @xcite using series expansion methods , is @xmath39 . using mc we obtained @xmath40 which is roughly consistent with gaunt s value .",
    "our result also agrees well with the values of @xmath41 for large @xmath0 being approximately @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this provides solid evidence for the existence of a reentry phase transition in the temperature magnetic field plane phase diagram of an ising spin system with nearest - neighbor anti - ferromagnetic interactions on the bcc lattice  @xcite .",
    "we also find , as in  @xcite , that for large @xmath0 , @xmath4 for the crystal  demixed transition can be computed via pirogov ",
    "sinai theory  @xcite yielding , @xmath45 which matches up smoothly with our mc results , see fig .",
    "it is easy to show that there is a demixing transition for @xmath46  @xcite , the existence of sharp interfaces between coexisting phases , for @xmath6 , on the cubic lattice at large fugacity @xmath1 was proven in  @xcite .",
    "we next present results of our simulations and refer the reader to  @xcite for a more detailed description of the model and additional references .",
    "our mc simulations were carried out on a bcc lattice of size @xmath47 with periodic boundary conditions . on an initially empty lattice we deposit particles chosen at random from the @xmath0 components at fugacity @xmath1 respecting the exclusion of different species occupying neighboring sites .",
    "we then sequentially update the lattice using a checkerboard algorithm resulting in a good vectorization .",
    "an update of a lattice site @xmath48 on one of the two simple cubic sublattices @xmath49 , making up the bcc lattice , which is occupied by a particle of type @xmath17 ( @xmath50 indicating an empty site ) is done as follows : we randomly choose a new trial particle of type @xmath51 , where @xmath51 can have any integer value between @xmath52 and @xmath0 with equal probability .",
    "@xmath53 refers to an attempted removal of a particle @xmath54 from the lattice site , which is successful , if a number @xmath55 randomly chosen with equal probability between @xmath52 and @xmath56 is smaller than the inverse fugacity @xmath57 .",
    "when this occurs @xmath17 gets the value @xmath52 , otherwise it remains unchanged , @xmath58 refers to an attempted deposition of a particle of type @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath50 then it is successful if each of the four nearest neighbor sites is either empty or occupied by a particle of the same type ( @xmath51 ) and @xmath59 . in this case @xmath17 gets the value @xmath51 , otherwise it remains unchanged .",
    "a direct replacement attempt of a particle @xmath60 surrounded by eight empty nearest neighbor sites is always successful .",
    "typically in a simulation run after an equilibration of @xmath61 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) we update the lattice @xmath62 times , the configuration of every tenth step is taken for the evaluation of the averages . a typical run with @xmath62 mcs took about 1  cpu hours on a cray  ymp .",
    "let @xmath63 denote the occupancy of a site , @xmath64 if the site @xmath48 is empty and @xmath65 otherwise . as observables we took histograms @xmath66 of the order parameter @xmath67 for the crystal structure and @xmath68 of the order parameter @xmath69 for the demixed phase in subsystems of size @xmath70 , @xmath71(-1)^{2*s-1 } \\label{pc}\\ ] ] and @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the number of particles of type @xmath17 in a subsystem of size @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the average overall density .      for a given @xmath0 the transition activity @xmath76 is found by finite size scaling techniques  @xcite . in particular the @xmath77 moments of the order parameter distribution @xmath66",
    ", @xmath78 can be evaluated in subsystems of size @xmath74 , and from them the fourth order cumulant  @xcite @xmath79  ,      in a one phase region far away from a critical point the subsystem size typically can be chosen larger than the correlation length @xmath81 , @xmath82 and the order parameter distribution is to a good approximation a gaussian centered around @xmath52 , resulting in @xmath83 for @xmath84 . in the two phase coexistence region far away from a critical point we can again assume @xmath85 and the order parameter distribution is bimodal resulting in @xmath86 for @xmath84 .",
    "near the critical point however we have @xmath87 , and using scaling arguments  @xcite the cumulant is a function of @xmath88 , resulting for @xmath89 in the same value of @xmath90 for all different @xmath91 .",
    "this method allows the efficient determination of critical points by analyzing the cumulants for different values of @xmath1 on different length scales @xmath91 . applied to our model",
    "we should see , for low values of @xmath1 , when the system is in the disordered one phase region , @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "increasing @xmath1 , we obtain , for large enough @xmath0 , a crystal phase with @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "near @xmath76 we expect @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "this method for locating the transition fugacities was used in our previous studies  @xcite on the square lattice as well .    for @xmath98",
    "we obtain in this way values of @xmath99 respectively , for @xmath100 , @xmath101 and for @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "cumulants for the gas  crystal transition of the hard diamond and the @xmath104component system are shown in figs .  1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the transition points are presented in fig .  3 together with the asymptotic expression @xmath105 .",
    "this corresponds to the value of @xmath37 on the bcc lattice @xmath40 which we obtained using mc techniques .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "3 a purely empirical fit of the @xmath106corrections for @xmath76 , @xmath107 , to the mc data , with a value of @xmath108 .",
    "the minimum number of components required for the existence of the crystal phase on the bcc lattice is @xmath109 . in fig .",
    "4 we show the approach of the critical fugacity @xmath110 to the limit of the hard diamond system .      for @xmath6 we obtain a direct transition from the gas phase to the demixed phase at a transition fugacity of @xmath111 ;",
    "the transition is second order with ising exponents as on a simple cubic lattice studied by dickman et al .",
    "@xcite .    for @xmath112",
    "we observe a direct first order transition from the crystal to the demixed phase .",
    "this transition was analyzed by studying the order parameter distribution @xmath68 . in the simulations we find a hysteresis region around @xmath113 ,",
    "going approximately between two values of @xmath1 , say @xmath114 and @xmath115 , when increasing and decreasing the fugacity . in cases of a small hysteresis region with extent of less than @xmath116 ,",
    "@xmath113 was taken as the average of this region , @xmath117 . in cases of a larger hysteresis region",
    "we located the transition fugacity @xmath113 by finding the relative stability of one of the two phases during a simulation starting from configurations with both phases present in parallel slices extending over the length of the simulation box , as described in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting phase transition values of @xmath113 are shown in fig .  1 .",
