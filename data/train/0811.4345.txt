    "the current `` concordance '' cosmological model assumes a flat @xmath3cdm universe composed of baryons , cold dark matter , and `` dark energy '' that accelerates the expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "the location of the first peak in the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation determines the angular - size distance to the surface of last scattering .",
    "this distance depends on the amount of dark energy and the geometry and current expansion rate of the universe , . if one does not assume that the universe is flat , the cmb data alone are consistent with a wide range of values of .",
    "thus , independent measurements of  are needed to justify the flatness assumption and to determine whether dark energy is the cosmological constant , @xmath3 , of general relativity , a variable  quintessence \" @xcite , or possibly something else .",
    "@xcite concludes that the most important single complement to cmb data would be a precise (  @xmath4% uncertainty ) measurement of .",
    "the current `` best value '' for the hubble constant , @xmath5 from the hst key project @xcite , is based on luminosity distance measurements to extragalactic cepheid variables treated as `` standard candles . '' the 10% uncertainty in  is dominated by systematic errors that can not easily be reduced by observations of more galaxies .",
    "very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations of the  megamaser in the nearby seyfert 2 galaxy   have provided an accurate , angular - diameter distance to the galaxy @xcite , bypassing the problems of standard candles .",
    "the  masers in   arise in a thin ( annular ) disk viewed nearly edge - on @xcite and appear at galactocentric radii @xmath6  pc .",
    "maser lines near the systemic velocity of the galaxy come from gas moving across the sky on the near side of the disk , and `` high - velocity lines , '' with relative velocities of up to @xmath7  , come from gas moving along the line of sight at the disk tangent points .",
    "the high - velocity lines display a keplerian rotation curve , implying a central mass of @xmath8  , presumably in the form of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) @xcite .    for , the velocities of individual systemic features",
    "are observed to increase by @xmath9 @xcite , allowing a direct measurement of the centripetal acceleration ( @xmath10 ) of clouds moving across our line of sight near the nucleus @xcite .",

    "maser proper motions can be also be used to measure distance , but generally yield less accurate distances than using accelerations .",
    "observations with the vlba of the  masers in  have been carefully modeled , yielding the most accurate distance ( @xmath14 mpc ) to date for a galaxy @xcite .",
    "unfortunately ,   is too close to determine  directly ( by dividing its recessional velocity of 475  by its distance ) , since the galaxy s deviation from the hubble - flow could be a significant fraction of its recessional velocity . instead",
    ", the measured distance to  has been used to anchor the zero point of the cepheid period - luminosity relation @xcite .",
    "however , galaxies with edge - on , disk - like  masers , similar to those in , that are distant enough to be in the hubble flow ( @xmath15   mpc ) could be used to measure  directly @xcite .",
    "surveys of galaxies for nuclear  masers have been quite successful and have identified more than 100 extragalactic nuclear  masers @xcite . in order to coordinate efforts to find and image new sources of nuclear  masers , we formed a team of scientists active in this area of research from the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics , the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) , and the max - planck - institut fr radioastronomie ( mpifr ) .",
    "this effort , called the megamaser cosmology project ( mcp ) , is aimed at measuring  directly , with @xmath16% accuracy , using a combination of vlbi imaging and single - dish monitoring of nuclear  masers toward @xmath17 galaxies .",
    "recently @xcite discovered a relatively strong  maser ( @xmath18  jy ) toward the seyfert 2 nucleus of .",
    "the  maser spectrum has the characteristics of an edge - on disk similar to .",
    "the  masers span @xmath19   in doppler shift and the systemic masers were observed to accelerate by up to 8.1  , suggesting an origin in a sub - pc disk about a @xmath20  black hole .    in this paper , and in @xcite ( hereafter paper ii ) , we report results leading to the first mcp measurement of .",
    "sensitive vlbi observations and images of the nuclear  masers toward  are presented in this paper . in paper ii",

    "the combination of the vlbi imaging and the single - dish acceleration data may yield a measurement of  with an accuracy comparable to that of the hubble key project .",
    "we observed  on 2006 december 10 for a total of 12 hours , with the 10 nrao vlba antennas ( under program bb227a ) , augmented by the green bank telescope ( gbt ) and the effelsberg 100-m telescope .",
    "the coordinates of the sources observed are listed in table  [ table : positions ] .",
    "we alternated between two observing modes : ( 1 ) a 60-min block of continuous tracking of  ( self - calibration mode ) and ( 2 ) a 45-min block of rapid switching between  and a nearby compact continuum source j0728 + 5907 ( phase - referencing mode ) .",
    "the phase - referencing blocks were a `` back - up '' in the event that the  maser signal was not strong enough for self - calibration .",
    "both observing modes were successful .",

    "we centered 16-mhz bands at lsr velocities ( optical definition ) as follows : left circularly polarized ( lcp ) bands at 3880 , 3710 , 3265 , 2670 and 2500  and right circularly polarized ( rcp ) at 3880 , 3265 and 2670  .",
    "the signals were sampled at the nyquist rate ( 32  mbits  s@xmath22 ) and with 2 bits per sample .",
    "we placed `` geodetic '' blocks at the start and end of our observations , in order to solve for atmospheric and clock delay residuals for each antenna @xcite . in these blocks",
    "we rapidly cycled among 14  compact radio sources that spanned a wide range of zenith angles at all antennas .",
    "these data were taken in left circular polarization with eight 16-mhz bands that spanned 492 mhz of bandwidth between 22.00 and 22.49 ghz ; the bands were spaced in a `` minimum redundancy '' manner to sample , as uniformly as possible , all frequency differences .",
    "the data were correlated , corrected for ionospheric delays using total electron content measurements @xcite , and residual multi - band delays and fringe rates were determined for all sources .",
    "the multi - band delays and fringe rates were modeled as owing to a vertical atmospheric delay and delay - rate , as well as a clock offset and clock drift rate , at each antenna .",
    "using a least - squares fitting program , we estimated zenith atmospheric path - delays and clock errors with accuracies typically @xmath23  cm and @xmath24  nsec , respectively .",
    "we observed the strong continuum source , j0753 + 5352 , hourly in order to monitor delay and electronic phase differences among and across the if bands .",
    "generally , variations of phase across the vlba bandpasses are small ( @xmath25 ) across the central 90% of the band and thus we needed no bandpass corrections .",
    "we tested the effect of bandpass corrections , using the j0753 + 5352 data , and found position differences of @xmath26  mas for maser features mid - way between the band center and band edge .",
    "the raw data recorded at each antenna were cross - correlated with an integration time of 1.05  sec at the vlba correlation facility in socorro , nm .",
    "for this short integration time we had to correlate the data in two passes in order to achieve sufficient spectral resolution ( 128 spectral channels for each if band ) without exceeding the maximum correlator output rate . before calibration ,",
    "the two correlation data sets were `` glued '' together .",
    "we calibrated the data using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "first , we corrected interferometer delays and phases for the effects of diurnal feed rotation ( parallactic angle ) and for small errors in the values of the earth s orientation parameters used at the time of correlation . by analyzing the data taken in phase - referencing mode",
    ", we determined that the strong maser feature at @xmath27  , which we later used as the phase reference for the self - calibration mode data , was offset from the position of  used in the vlba correlator by ( @xmath28 )  mas toward ( east , north ) , respectively , relative to j0728 + 5907 .",
    "since the vlba correlator model includes no ionospheric delays , we used global total electron content models to remove ionospheric effects .",
    "we then corrected the data for residual zenith atmospheric delays and clock drifts , as determined from the geodetic block data .",
    "while we obtained good atmospheric / clock corrections for most antennas , insufficient data were obtained for the effelsberg ( eb ) and mauna kea ( mk ) antennas for this task .",
    "thus , we later used the data from the hourly observations of j0753 + 5352 to determine final delay corrections for the  data .",
    "we corrected the interferometer visibility amplitudes for the few percent effects of biases in the threshold levels of the data samplers at each antenna .",
    "we also entered system temperature and antenna gain curve information into calibration tables .",
    "these tables were used later to convert correlation coefficients to flux densities .",
    "next , we performed a `` manual phase - calibration '' to remove delay and phase differences among all bands .",
    "this was accomplished with data from one scan on a strong calibrator , 4c  39.25 .",
    "we did not shift the frequency axes of the maser interferometer spectra to compensate for the doppler shift changes during the @xmath29  hr  observing track , as these effects were less than our velocity resolution of 1.7  .",
    "the final calibration involved selecting a maser feature as the interferometer phase - reference .",
    "the strongest maser feature in the spectrum peaked at @xmath30  jy and was fairly broad .",
    "we found that using 5 channels spanning an lsr velocity range of 2685 to 2692  (  channels 52 to 56 from the blue - shifted high velocity band centered at @xmath31  ) , adding together both polarizations , and fitting fringes over a 1  min period gave optimum results .",
    "croix ( sc ) antenna failed to produce phase - reference solutions and data from that antenna were discarded . for most antennas at most times",
    "the phases could be easily interpolated between solutions .",
    "however , when the differences between adjacent reference phases exceeded @xmath32 , the data between those times were discarded .",
    "this editing was done on baseline ( not antenna ) data , since correlated phases between antennas do not affect interferometer coherence .",
    "after calibration , we fourier transformed the gridded   to make images of the maser emission in all spectral channels for each of the five if bands .",
    "the point - source response function had fwhm of @xmath33  mas elongated along a position angle of @xmath34 east of north .",
    "the images were deconvolved with the point - source response using the clean algorithm and restored with a circular gaussian beam with a 0.30  mas fwhm .",
    "all images appeared to contain single , point - like maser spots .",
    "we then fitted each spectral channel image with an elliptical gaussian brightness distribution in order to obtain positions and flux densities .",
    "channel maps typically had rms noise levels of @xmath35  mjy for the dual - polarized if bands and @xmath36  mjy for the single - polarization if bands .",
    "the flux densities from the gaussian fits for all spectral channels in all if bands were used to generate the interferometer spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "when little signal was detected in a spectral channel , as evidenced by a failed fit or a spot size greater than 1  mas , we assigned that channel zero flux density .",
    "the flux densities and positions determined by gaussian fitting each spectral channel image are reported in tables  [ table : reds ] , [ table : systemics ] and [ table : blues ] for maser spots stronger than 10  mjy .",
    "the positions of these spots are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spots ] .",
    "the nearly linear arrangement of the maser spots on the sky is striking .",
    "the red- and blue - shifted high - velocity spots straddle the systemic emission complex .",
    "this spatial - velocity arrangement is characteristic of a nearly edge - on disk , as is well documented for  @xcite .",
    "we calculated the position along the spot distribution ( an impact parameter along position angle of @xmath37 east of north ) and show a position - velocity plot in fig .  [",
    "fig : pv ] .",
    "the high - velocity masers display a keplerian velocity ( @xmath38 ) versus impact parameter ( or radius ) , suggesting that the gravitational potential is dominated by a smbh .",
    "the keplerian velocity pattern is centered at @xmath39  .",
    "this is slightly offset from the central velocity of hi emission from the galaxy at @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "( note : @xmath41  for . )",
    "correcting the maser velocity to the cmb reference frame ( @xmath42 ) , yields a recessional velocity of 3325  .",
    "thus , for @xmath43  mpc@xmath22 , s distance would be expected to be @xmath44 mpc .",
    "the detected blue - shifted high velocity masers sample disk radii between 0.35 and 0.70  mas ( 0.08 to 0.16  pc ) and achieve rotation speeds as high as 792  , with respect to a central systemic velocity of 3265  .",
    "the detected red - shifted masers sample radii of 0.50 to 1.33  mas ( 0.11 to 0.30  pc ) and achieve rotation speeds up to 647  . also shown by the straight dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : pv ] is the position - velocity distribution expected for systemic maser spots that lie at a radius of 0.43  mas from the central mass , whose assumed location is indicated by the plus - sign ( @xmath45 ) in the figure .",
    "these spatial - kinematic parameters are comparable to those of the  masers in , which sample radii of @xmath46 to @xmath47  pc and achieve rotation speeds of @xmath48  .",
    "the moderately lower rotation speed at a slightly smaller radius suggests that the smbh at the center of  is less massive than the @xmath49   smbh in . at a distance of 46  mpc ,",
    "the high - velocity data for  can be well fit by gas in circular orbit about a central mass of @xmath50  , as shown by the blue and red dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : pv ] .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spots ] , the systemic features lie between the high velocity features but are distributed along a position angle of roughly @xmath51 ( east of north ) .",
    "thus , they are misaligned by approximately @xmath52 with respect to the @xmath37 position angle of the disk , obtained by drawing a line through the high velocity masers .",
    "this suggests that the  disk may be slightly inclined and warped and/or that the systemic masers are not all at the same radius .",
    "( note that the  disk is both inclined by @xmath53 with respect to our line of sight and warped @xcite . )",
    "deviation from a perfectly flat , edge - on disk for  can also be seen in the position - velocity plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pv ] ) as a slight bending of the systemic maser spots and in the variation in accelerations seen by @xcite .",
    "modeling of the disk will need to accommodate these complications .",
    "we searched for continuum emission from the vicinity of the smbh (  near the position of the systemic velocity masers ) by summing channels 5 through 120 of the ( red shifted ) dual - circularly polarized band centered at @xmath54  .",
    "we maximized the detection sensitivity by natural weighting of the data when imaging .",
    "the masers were detected at the expected position , offset by @xmath55  mas from the position of the smbh , but no continuum emission was detected at a @xmath56 limit of @xmath57  mjy .",
    "the discovery of  masers emanating from a sub - pc disk in the seyfert 2 galaxy  more than two decades ago has led to detailed imaging of an agn accretion disk .",
    "geometric modeling of the keplerian orbits of the masers yielded the most accurate distance to any galaxy , allowing recalibration of the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "now , the recent discovery by @xcite of  masers in  offers the opportunity to extend this technique to a galaxy seven times more distant .    in this paper we presented vlbi images of the  masers , which showed that these masers are remarkably similar to those in . in both sources ,",
    "the spatial distribution is nearly linear , with high velocity masers on both sides ( both spatially and spectrally ) of systemic velocity masers .",
