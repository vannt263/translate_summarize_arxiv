    "understanding how and when supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) grow is currently of central importance in extragalactic astronomy .",
    "a significant amount of empirical work has established correlations between smbh mass and host galaxy spheroidal properties , such as luminosity @xcite , stellar velocity dispersion ( the @xmath0@xmath1 relationship , e.g. , @xcite ) , concentration or sersic index @xcite , bulge mass @xcite , and binding energy @xcite .",
    "these scaling relationships imply that the evolution of spheroidal galaxies and the growth of smbhs are intricately tied together .",
    "the currently favored mechanism for linking the growth of smbhs and their hosts is black hole feedback , whereby black holes grow by accreting gas in so - called `` active '' phases , possibly fueled by a major merger of two gas - rich galaxies , until feedback energy from the smbh expels gas and shuts off the accretion process @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested that the origin of the scaling relationships does not necessarily require smbh feedback , but emerges from the stochastic nature of the hierarchical assembly of black hole and stellar mass through galaxy mergers .",
    "@xcite .",
    "feedback - driven ` self - regulated ' growth of black holes has been able to reproduce the local @xmath0@xmath1 relationship in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "moreover , agn feedback has also been invoked as a means of quenching the growth of the most massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous models linking smbh growth , the quasar phase , and galaxy evolution @xcite . while feedback is likely important for regulating the growth of smbhs and galaxies , the fueling mechanisms that contribute to growing the smbh are likely diverse .",
    "major - mergers of gas - rich galaxies may fuel quasars at high redshift , and grow the most massive smbhs .",
    "however , major - mergers alone do not appear to be sufficient to reproduce the number of x - ray faint agn @xcite , and accretion of ambient gas via internal galactic processes @xcite , may fuel these fainter , lower @xmath0 agn at lower @xmath2 . this is supported by the fact that many agn are observed to live in late - type galaxies out to @xmath3 @xcite , and the x - ray luminosity function of agn hosted by late - type galaxies suggests that fueling by minor interactions or internal instabilities represents a non - negligible contribution to the accretion history of the universe @xcite",
    ".    the black hole mass function ( bhmf ) provides a complete census of the mass of smbhs and their evolution .",
    "because of this , the bhmf is one of the primary empirical tools available for investigating the growth of smbhs , and for constraining theoretical models for the growth of the smbh population .",
    "because smbhs and galaxies are thought to be linked in their evolution , the bhmf provides insight into the fueling mechanisms that dominate black hole growth , and therefore into the role of feedback in the evolution of the host galaxy .",
    "the bhmf is also an important tool in planning future surveys , as it provides an estimate of the distribution of smbh mass expected for the survey .",
    "this in turn is important because mass is a fundamental quantity of the black hole , and therefore is an important observational quantity for empirical studies of black hole accretion physics @xcite .",
    "of course , further improvement to our understanding of black hole accretion physics will further improve our modeling and understanding of black hole accretion and feedback , which in turn will improve our understanding of black hole - galaxy coevolution .",
    "therefore , the bhmf is an important empirical quantity for smbh studies .    in this review",
    "we discuss the current status of bhmf estimation and theoretical modeling . in ",
    "[ s - est ] we discuss the non - trivial task of estimating the bhmf . in   [ s - local ] we discuss current estimates of the local smbh bhmf . in ",
    "[ s - continuity ] we discuss bhmf estimates derived by combining the local bhmf with the agn luminosity function via a continuity equation . in   [ s - agn ]",
    "we discuss bhmfs estimated for agn only . in ",
    "[ s - theory ] we review theoretical models for smbh growth that predict the smbh bhmf . finally , in   [ s - future ]",
    "we discuss directions for future improvements to the empirical and theoretical studies of the bhmf .",
    "we note that unlike , say , the luminosity function , the division between ` observational ' and ` theoretical ' studies is not as clear for the bhmf , as some amount of modeling is necessary in order to estimate the bhmf from strictly observational quantities .",
    "we have attempted to divide the studies according to whether the bhmf is constrained empirically , as in , say , a formal statistical fitting procedure , or if it is predicted from a theoretical model for smbh growth . in reality , the line between theoretical and empirical studies is blurry , and some procedures which we have considered to be empirical may be thought of as theoretical .",
    "the black hole mass function , denoted as @xmath4 , is the number of sources per comoving volume @xmath5 with black hole masses in the range @xmath6 .",
    "the black hole mass function is related to the joint probability distribution of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , @xmath7 , as @xmath8 the normalization of the bhmf is @xmath9 , the total number of smbhs in the observable universe , and is given by the integral of @xmath10 over @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "similar to luminosity function estimation , the bhmf may be estimated from astronomical surveys . however , while there are many well - established methods for estimating luminosity functions , there are two complications that make bhmf estimation a more difficult problem @xcite .",
    "the first is the issue of incompleteness .",
    "surveys are typically constructed by finding the set of objects of interest containing a smbh that satisfy a flux criteria , e.g. , all objects brighter than some flux limit .",
    "surveys are not constructed by selecting on mass . because there is a distribution of luminosities at a given smbh mass , whether it be the luminosity of the host galaxy or of the agn , some smbhs will scatter above the flux limit and some below .",
    "this creates a selection function which is less sensitive to @xmath0 , and it is possible that a survey may be incomplete in all mass bins .    the second complication is the large uncertainty in smbh mass among mass estimators . currently it is not possible to obtain reliable mass estimators for large numbers of smbhs through dynamical and modeling of the stellar or gaseous components , and thus scaling relationships are employed .",
    "masses may be estimated using scaling relationships between @xmath0 and the properties of the host galaxy bulge or the luminosity and the width of the broad emission lines for agn @xcite .",
    "it has also recently been suggested that the x - ray variability properties of agn may also provide another scaling relationship for estimating @xmath0 @xcite , but further work is needed for developing this .",
    "while these scaling relationships enable one to estimate @xmath0 for large numbers of smbhs , they also contain a significant intrinsic statistical scatter .",
    "gltekin , k. , et al .",
    "@xcite find that for early type galaxies there is an intrinsic scatter in @xmath0 of @xmath11 dex and @xmath12 dex at fixed host galaxy bulge dispersion and luminosity , respectively ; the amplitude of the scatter is larger for late type galaxies .",
    "for agn with broad emission lines , vestergaard & peterson @xcite estimate the scatter in @xmath0 at fixed luminosity and line width to be @xmath13 dex , depending on which emission line is used .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in the mass estimates can have a significant effect on the inferred bhmf .",
    "the distribution of the mass estimates is the convolution of the intrinsic bhmf with the error distribution in the mass estimates . in general",
    ", it is typically assumed that the error in the mass estimates is independent of the actual value of @xmath0 .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath0 estimated through dynamical modeling , however independence between @xmath0 and its error is likely to be a good approximation for @xmath0 estimated using scaling relationships .",
    "because scaling relationships are the only feasible manner in which to estimate @xmath0 for a large sample of smbhs , which is necessary for any estimate of the bhmf , we will assume that @xmath0 and its error are independent . under",
    "the assumption of independence between the estimated @xmath0 and its error , the bhmf that would be inferred directly from the distribution of the mass estimates is broader than the intrinsic bhmf , and is thus biased .",
    "figure [ f - bhmf_illust ] illustrates this effect , where an intrinsic mass function is compared with the distribution of an unbiased mass estimator having a statistical uncertainty of 0.3 , 0.4 , and 0.5 dex , respectively . as can be seen , the distribution of mass estimates is significantly different than the intrinsic mass function . in particular , the distribution of the mass estimates falls off more slowly with increasing @xmath0 , and overpredicts the number of smbhs at the high @xmath0 end of the mass function .",
    "the bias is worse when the dispersion in the scatter in the mass estimates becomes larger .",
    "end and for large statistical error . ]      in order to estimate the smbh mass function in an unbiased manner , it is necessary to match the mass function with the observed distribution of the mass estimates and any additional observational quantities that the selection function depends on .",
    "the basic idea is to start with an assumed mass function .",
    "then , calculate the distribution of mass estimates implied by this mass function .",
    "in addition , calculate the distribution of observational quantities that one s sample is selected on , say , flux , that is implied by the assumed mass function .",
    "this step allows one to correct for incompleteness , but requires an additional assumption about how to relate the mass function to the quantity that one s sample is selected on .",
    "finally , impose the selection function for the sample , and compare the predicted observed distributions of mass estimates and any other observables ( e.g. , flux ) with the actual distributions .",
    "if they are not consistent , then the data rule out the assumed mass function and relationship between @xmath0 and the observable quantities .    we can make the above procedure more quantitative by deriving the likelihood function for the smbh mass function .",
    "kelly , vestergaard , & fan @xcite derived the likelihood function for the mass function when using masses estimated from agn broad emission lines .",
    "they used this likelihood function for developing a bayesian approach to estimating the smbh mass function .",
    "although their method was limited to broad line mass estimates , it is straightforward to generalize their formalism for any generic mass estimator .",
    "denote the black hole mass estimate as @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , denote as @xmath15 the set of observables that one uses to select one s sample . in the majority of cases",
    "this will be flux at one or more wavelengths .",
    "then , the likelihood function for the bhmf based on a sample of @xmath16 smbhs is @xmath17^{n - n }      \\prod_{i=1}^n \\int_{0}^{\\infty } p(\\hat{m}_{bh , i}|m_{bh , i } , z_i ,      x_i ) p(x_i|m_{bh , i},z_i,\\psi ) p(m_{bh , i},z_i|\\theta)\\ dm_{bh , i } ,       \\label{eq - likhood }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the bhmf is related to @xmath9 and the probability distribution of @xmath0 and @xmath2 via equation ( [ eq - phiconvert ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath18 is the binomial coefficient , @xmath19 denotes the parameters for the bhmf , @xmath20 denotes the parameters for the distribution in @xmath15 at fixed @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and @xmath21 is the probability of including a smbh in one s sample as a function @xmath19 and @xmath20 . here , we have assumed that the distribution in the mass estimates at fixed @xmath22 and @xmath23 , is known , although one could include additional free parameters for this as well .",
    "the binomial coefficient arises from the fact that the number of objects included in one s survey follows a binomial distribution and @xmath24 , so equation ( [ eq - likhood ] ) converges to the poisson distribution when @xmath25 .",
    "see @xcite for further details . ] with @xmath9 trials and probability of success @xmath21 .",
    "the probability of including a smbh in one s survey as a function of the bhmf , @xmath21 , is calculated from the survey selection function @xmath26 as @xmath27\\ dx .",
    "\\label{eq - selfunc}\\ ] ] it is up to the researcher to choose the particular parameteric form for the smbh mass function , the distribution in the mass estimates at fixed @xmath28 and @xmath15 , and the distribution of the observable that the sample is selected on ( e.g. , flux ) at fixed @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "typical choices are log - normal distributions , schechter functions , and mixtures of log - normal distributions .",
    "once one has done this , one can use equation ( [ eq - likhood ] ) to compute a maximum - likelihood estimate for the bhmf , or perform bayesian inference .",
    "an alternative form of estimating the bhmf can be used when the mass estimates are derived from an observational quantity , @xmath29 , and the intrinsic distribution of @xmath29 is known .",
    "this is commonly used to estimate the local mass function using host - galaxy scaling relationships @xcite . in this case , the mass function is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the comoving number density of smbhs as a function of the quantity @xmath29 .",
    "when both @xmath32 and @xmath31 are known then the bhmf follows directly from equation ( [ eq - mfunc_alt ] ) . as an example , if the mass function is derived from the scaling between @xmath0 and host galaxy spheroidal luminosity , @xmath33 , then @xmath34 , @xmath32 is the @xmath0@xmath33 relationship , and @xmath31 is the luminosity function of stellar bulges hosting smbhs . as with bhmfs determined from a mass estimator , improper treatment of the intrinsic scatter in @xmath0 at fixed @xmath29 will lead to a biased estimate of the bhmf .",
    "however , when calculating the bhmf from equation ( [ eq - mfunc_alt ] ) , ignoring the intrinsic scatter results in an estimated bhmf that is too narrow , underpredicting the number of smbhs at the high mass end of @xmath35 .",
    "this is opposite to the case when one estimates the bhmf directly from mass estimates .",
    "the observed scaling between @xmath0 and the properties of the smbh host galaxy bulge have motivated several groups to estimate the local bhmf @xcite , with decreasing statistical uncertainties .",
    "these estimates of the local bhmf have formed the basis for many studies which have attempted to map black hole growth by comparing with the agn luminosity function ; this is further discussed in   [ s - continuity ] .",
    "typically , the local bhmf is estimated using the local @xmath0@xmath1 relationship or the local @xmath0@xmath33 relationship , combined with the local number density of galaxies as a function of stellar velocity dispersion or bulge luminosity .",
    "the scaling relationships between @xmath0 and host galaxy properties are only determined for the local universe , and thus most authors have limited their determination of the bhmf based on them to the local bhmf .",
    "an exception is tamura , ohta , & ueda @xcite , who estimated the bhmf out to @xmath3 assuming that evolution in the @xmath0@xmath33 relation is driven only by passive evolution in @xmath33 .",
    "evolution in the scaling relationships is currently an area of intense study , with most groups finding evidence that the normalization of the scaling relationships increases towards higher @xmath2 @xcite , at least for active smbhs .",
    "however , there are still concerns regarding potential biases due to selection effects @xcite , but see treu et al .",
    "@xcite and bennert et al .",
    "@xcite for procedures aimed at modeling and correcting for selection .",
    "there may also be biases due to extrapolating the agn mass estimates derived from the broad emission lines to luminous quasars at high @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "as such , the uncertainties on the quantitative form of the evolution in the scaling relationships and their scatter are currently large , limiting their use for determining the bhmf outside of the local universe .",
    "when the @xmath0@xmath1 relationship is used to estimate the local bhmf , it is common to use the velocity dispersion distribution derived from the sdss by sheth et al .",
    "@xcite , with an additional component representing the brightest cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "sheth et al .",
    "@xcite estimate the velocity dispersion distribution for late type galaxies by using the tully - fisher relation to convert the luminosity function of late type galaxies to a circular velocity distribution , and then set @xmath36 . when the @xmath0@xmath33 relation is used it is typical to estimate the distribution of @xmath33",
    "seperately for early and late type galaxies by converting their respective luminosity functions to spheroidal luminosity functions using an assumed ratio of bulge luminosity to total luminosity . from this it has been inferred that the local bhmf is dominated by early type galaxies at @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "shankar , weinberg , & miralda - escud @xcite present a compilation of recently determined local bhmfs based on a variety of methods , scaling relations used , and data sets used . in figure [ f - local_bhmf ] we show the range of local bhmfs estimated from the @xmath0@xmath1 , @xmath0@xmath33 , and @xmath0@xmath38 relationships , as presented in shankar et al . @xcite . in general , estimates of the local mass density of smbhs span the range @xmath39@xmath40 for @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath0@xmath33 , and @xmath0@xmath38 relationships , as compiled by shankar et al .",
    "@xcite . based on this estimate the local universe",
    "is dominated by smbhs with @xmath42 . ]    while the procedure for estimating the local bhmf is , in theory , straight - forward , a number of significant systematics remain .",
    "first , there is the observational difficulty that most bhmfs derived from the @xmath0@xmath1 relationship are based on sdss spectra .",
    "unfortunately , the sdss velocity dispersions are based on a fixed aperture , and thus the size of the aperture relative to the bulge varies with the apparent size of the galaxy and its inclination .",
    "in addition , the spectral resolution of sdss spectra is @xmath43 , making it difficult to reliably measure @xmath1 for smbhs with @xmath42 .",
    "another concern is that the local bhmf is derived by assuming that the @xmath0@xmath1 or @xmath0@xmath33 relations are single power - laws with a constant scatter in @xmath0 at fixed @xmath1 or @xmath33 .",
    "however , recent work has shown these assumptions to be incorrect .",
    "for one , the @xmath0@xmath1 and @xmath0@xmath33 relations diverge at the high @xmath0 end , which lauer et al .",
    "@xcite suggest implies that the @xmath0@xmath1 relation is not a single power - law .",
    "this divergence creates an inconsistency in the bhmfs derived from these two scaling relationships @xcite .",
    "similarly , the @xmath44@xmath45 relationships for the sdss and dynamical @xmath0 smbh samples are inconsistent , suggesting a possible selection bias in the estimated bhmfs @xcite .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation is larger for spirals @xcite , and appears to increase at low @xmath0 such that most smbhs lie below the @xmath0@xmath1 relation , ( * ? ? ?",
    "several authors have found differences in the slope and scatter of the scaling relations for pseudobulges @xcite ; however , it is unclear that this result is due to differences in the perceived bulge velocity dispersions for bulges as compared to pseudobulges or due to different scaling relationships .",
    "kormendy , bender , & cornell @xcite argue that @xmath0 does not correlate with galaxy disks , and only correlates weakly , if at all , with pseudobulges .",
    "although there is still much that we do not understand about the @xmath0 and host galaxy scaling relationship , these recent results suggest that the scaling relationships are not a single power - law with constant intrinsic dispersion in @xmath0 , representing a significant source of systematic uncertainty in the estimated local bhmf , especially at the low - mass end .",
    "by employing the argument of soltan @xcite , numerous studies have attempted to estimate the bhmf at a variety of redshifts by comparing the accreted mass distribution implied by the quasar luminosity function with the local bhmf @xcite .",
    "these methods employ a continuity equation describing the evolution of the number density of smbhs @xcite : @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is the average growth rate of smbhs as a function of @xmath0 and cosmic age , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the rate at which the number density of smbhs changes due to mergers of black holes , or ejections of black holes from their host galaxies due to gravitational recoil .",
    "technically , @xmath49 can also include a contribution from smbhs which are created , but this has not been thought to occur over the redshift range in which equation ( [ eq - cont ] ) is typically applied , i.e. , @xmath50 . because the merger rate of black holes is currently unknown , many studies that have employed equation ( [ eq - cont ] ) set @xmath51 .    under the assumption that smbhs grow during phases of agn activity , agn demographics in combination with the local bhmf",
    "may be used to compute @xmath52 .",
    "this is because the agn luminosity function maps the accretion history onto smbhs , and the local bhmf acts as a boundary condition on equation ( [ eq - cont ] ) ; it is also possible in principle to include the bhmf for agn , which provides more information .",
    "studies that have used equation ( [ eq - cont ] ) to estimate the bhmf generally fall into two categories : those that assume an agn lightcurve , and those that employ the bhmf of agn .",
    "we discuss each of these seperately .",
    "most authors employing equation ( [ eq - cont ] ) have assumed a parameteric form for @xmath53 .",
    "the accretion rate is related to the bolometric luminosity output of the accretion flow onto the smbh as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the radiative efficiency of the accretion flow , @xmath56 is the accretion rate of matter onto the smbh , and @xmath57 is the speed of light .",
    "the growth rate of the smbh is @xmath58 , due to the fact that a fraction @xmath55 of accreted mass is radiated away as energy .",
    "making this substitution , the continuity equation becomes @xmath59 where we have ignored mergers of smbhs .",
    "equation ( [ eq - cont2 ] ) shows that it is possible to calculated the bhmf at an time given the local bhmf , an assumed average accretion flow lightcurve as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath60 , and an assumed radiative efficiency . because @xmath61 and @xmath62 imply a luminosity function , the local bhmf and agn luminosity function can be used to place constraints on @xmath55 and @xmath60",
    "this means that , in practice , one also has to assume a bolometeric correction , which itself likely depends on both black hole mass @xcite and @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "in addition , an estimate of @xmath60 also enables one to estimate the lifetime and duty cycle of agn activity , modulo some luminosity - dependent definition of an agn ; note that the agn duty cycle defines the fraction of smbhs that are ` active ' at a given @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "a variety of lightcurve models have been used when employing equation ( [ eq - cont2 ] ) to reconstruct the evolution of the bhmf .",
    "the simplest model is that where smbhs spend a fraction of their time radiating at a constant eddington ratio , and spend the remainder of their time in quiescence .",
    "the free parameters in this model are the eddington ratio , agn lifetime or duty cycle , and radiative efficiency",
    ". this model has been used by @xcite to study the build - up of the local black hole mass function , although @xcite also considered models where the average accretion rate relative to eddington falls off toward lower @xmath2 and higher @xmath0 .",
    "raimundo & fabian @xcite employed a variation on the constant @xmath63 models , assuming three different populations of agn with their own eddington ratio : a population of obscured low @xmath63 agn , a population of obscured agn with higher @xmath63 , and a population of unobscured agn .",
    "yu & lu @xcite modeled the quasar lightcurve as radiating at the eddington limit for a period of time , and then transitioning into a power - law decay .",
    "cao @xcite also modeled the quasar lightcurve as undergoing a power - law decay .",
    "lightcurves undergoing a power - law decay arise from self - regulation models , and describe the evolution of the lightcurve after black hole feedback unbinds the accreting gas , therefore quenching its fuel supply .",
    "the power - law decay occurs either as a result of evolution of a blast - wave @xcite or from viscous evolution of the accretion disk @xcite .        in figure [ f - lcurve ]",
    "we compare the bhmf calculated by shankar et al.@xcite with that calculated by cao @xcite . for shankar",
    "@xcite we show their reference model , which assumes a radiative efficiency of @xmath64 , an accretion rate relative to eddington of @xmath65 , and that half of all smbhs are active at @xmath66 .",
    "we show the model from cao @xcite which assumes a radiative efficiency of @xmath67 and a quasar lifetime of @xmath68 , as it better matches the shankar et al .",
    "@xcite estimates .",
    "the two estimates of the bhmf agree fairly well , despite the different quasar lightcurve models .    in general ,",
    "most of the studies that have used equation ( [ eq - cont2 ] ) in combination with an assumed quasar lightcurve have concluded the following :    * most smbh growth occurs in periods when the quasar is radiating near the eddington limit . *",
    "most , if not all , of the local black hole mass function can be explained as the relic of previous agn activity , implying that mergers of smbhs are not important for building up the local mass function .",
    "* smbh growth is anti - hierarchical , with the most massive black holes growing first .",
    "this has also been termed ` down - sizing ' of active smbhs . *",
    "the lifetime of agn activity is @xmath69 .",
    "* most smbhs have non - zero spin , as implied by inferred radiative efficiencies of @xmath70 .    however , while equation ( [ eq - cont2 ] ) has proven to be an important tool for studying smbh growth , and estimating the black hole mass function , it must be kept in mind that use of equation ( [ eq - cont2 ] ) often entails some strong assumptions .",
    "these methods rely on the assumed form of the quasar lightcurve , distribution of radiative efficiencies , and bolometeric corrections , all of which are subject to considerable uncertainty .",
    "moreover , in general these methods also rely on an estimate of the local black hole mass function , which , as discussed in   [ s - local ] , is itself subject to considerable uncertainty .",
    "indeed , there is a strong degeneracy between the estimated radiative efficiency of accretion and the normalization of the local bhmf , and therefore the uncertainty in @xmath55 is linearly proportional to that in the normalization ( or integral ) of the local bhmf .",
    "all of these issues have the potential to introduce systematic error into methods based on equation ( [ eq - cont2 ] ) , and further work is needed in reducing these systematics .",
    "an alternative to the methods described in ",
    "[ s - lcurve ] is to estimate the average value of the accretion rate onto smbhs directly from the observational data .",
    "this avoids the issue of assuming a form for the quasar lightcurve , as instead @xmath71 is derived directly from the estimated distribution of @xmath63 .",
    "techniques based on this approach require a means of linking the mass function of active smbhs to observational quantities , which is done via scaling relationships .",
    "this was the approach of merloni @xcite and merloni & heinz @xcite , who employed the black hole ` fundamental plane ' ( bhfp ) @xcite .",
    "the bhfp is a scaling relationship between @xmath0 , radio luminosity , and x - ray luminosity , that exists for low - accretion rate black holes ( i.e. , @xmath72 ) , extending from galactic black holes to supermassive ones .",
    "the bhfp likely reflects the connection between @xmath0 and the conversion of the accretion flow into radiative energy and jet power .",
    "it , in principle , enables one to connect the radio and x - ray luminosity functions to the mass function of active smbhs .",
    "having obtained a distribution of @xmath0 and x - ray luminosity at a given redshift for the active smbh population , merloni @xcite and merloni & heinz @xcite then convert this to a joint distribution of @xmath0 and @xmath56 assuming a conversion from x - ray luminosity to @xmath56 which depends on the eddington ratio .",
    "the joint distribution of @xmath0 and @xmath56 at a given redshift for active smbhs therefore enables calculation of the average growth rate @xmath73 , which can then be combined with the continuity equation to calculate the black hole mass function at the next redshift .",
    "their estimated bhmf is shown in figure [ f - mh08_bhmf ] , which is a recreation of their figure 5 .",
    "similar to methods based on assuming a quasar lightcurve , merloni & heinz @xcite concluded that smbhs grow anti - hierarchically ; however , in contrast to the lightcurve methods , merloni & heinz @xcite concluded that most smbhs have low spin as inferred from their derived radiative efficiency . in addition ,",
    "merloni & heinz @xcite concluded that the distribution of smbh accretion rates is broad , and that most smbh growth occurs during a radiatively efficient accretion mode .",
    "the method of estimating the bhmf from the bhfp developed by merloni @xcite and merloni & heinz @xcite has the advantage that it derives the distribution of accretion rates empirically .",
    "however , there are also disadvantages to this approach . the uncertainties regarding the bolometeric correction , estimation of the local bhmf , and radiative efficiency",
    "also apply to the bhfp method as well .",
    "moreover , as discussed in merloni & heinz @xcite , the bhfp is only defined for low - accretion rate objects , i.e. , objects with @xmath74 .",
    "merloni & heinz @xcite extrapolate the bhfp to higher accretion rates , after rescaling the normalization to ensure that the radio luminosity is weak for agn in the radiatively efficient mode ( those objects with @xmath75 and lacking a jet ) .",
    "unfortunately , the agn in the radiatively efficient mode make a significant contribution to the x - ray luminosity function , from which @xmath76 is derived .",
    "moreover , most studies , including those based on the bhfp have concluded that most smbh growth occurs at @xmath75 , which corresponds to the radiatively efficient mode . because the radiatively efficient mode also corresponds to the regime of largest systematic uncertainty for the bhfp",

    "the steady improvement in reverberation mapping of agn @xcite has revealed a correlation between the luminosity of agn and the broad line region radius @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible , in principle , to obtain an estimate of @xmath0 for broad line agn ( blagn ) by combining a luminosity - based estimate of the broad line region size with an estimate of the velocity dispersion of the broad line region gas obtained from the width of the broad emission lines @xcite .",
    "these virial mass estimates are then calibrated to the estimates of @xmath0 obtained from reverberation mapping , which themselves are calibrated to be consistent with the local @xmath0@xmath1 relationship @xcite .",

    "the statistical scatter in the virial mass estimates is currently estimated to be @xmath13 dex @xcite , although there are indications that the scatter may be smaller , at least for the most luminous quasars @xcite .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that the calibration for mg ii is obtained by enforcing consistency in the mean values of the mg ii mass estimator and the h@xmath78 and c iv ones , and therefore there is currently no direct estimate of the statistical scatter in mg ii - based virial mass estimates .",
    "in contrast , the amplitudes of the statistical scatter for h@xmath78 and c iv are estimated by comparing mass estimates derived from these lines with the masses derived from reverberation mapping @xcite .",

    "recent work has made improvement to models for the bhmf by focusing on theoretical modeling of the distribution of seed smbhs . the discovery of quasars at @xmath106@xmath107 with @xmath108 @xcite places strong constraints on the formation of smbh seeds due to the very limited amount of time available at that redshift to grow smbhs .",

    "the next class of @xmath117 m telescopes should provide a significantly improved picture of the scaling relationships , thus providing us with more accurate estimates of the local bhmf . * * improvements to techniques based on the continuity equation .",
    "* most studies that have invoked the continuity equation to link the local bhmf to the agn luminosity function have assumed a single radiative efficiency , which is equivalent to assuming a single black hole spin , and a universal agn lightcurve .",
    "neither of these assumptions are likely to be true , and improvements to this type of modeling should include a distribution of smbh spin and agn lightcurves .",
    "in addition , we need to better characterize the bolometeric corrections , which remain a significant source of systematic uncertainty .",
    "the continuity equation techniques should also be extended to map the evolution of the full joint 3-dimensional distribution of black hole mass , accretion rate , and spin . while this will not necessarily have a direct effect on estimating the bhmf",

    "[ s - broad ] a number of systematic uncertainties remain . in order to reduce these systematics , we need to better understand the broad line region geometry for the different emission lines , and how it scales with luminosity , which will provide us with a more accurate conversion from line width to velocity dispersion .",
    "moreover , accurate characterization of the broad line region geometry should remove the need to calibrate the scaling relationships to the local @xmath0@xmath1 relationship , which has its own set of systematics .",
    "improvements to reverberation mapping campaigns and modeling @xcite , as well as increasing the number of agn monitored for reverberation mapping , will be needed in order to really understand the systematics involved in the broad line mass estimates .",

    "however , these emission mechanisms depend on the geometry of the accretion state and the existence of a jet , which in turn depends on the accretion rate @xcite , and therefore the bhfp coefficients will be different for different classes of agn @xcite . in particular , the bhfp is currently poorly constrained for ` soft - state ' galactic black holes and radio - quiet agn . therefore , to reduce the systematics involved with the bhfp it will be necessary to characterize the scaling relationships and their scatter for radio - quiet objects . a correlation between the radio and x - ray luminosity",

    "however , the existence of these scaling relationships implies that the variability properties may offer another avenue for estimating @xmath0 and bhmfs , which may become increasingly valuable in the era of current and future large time - domain surveys , such as _ pan - starrs _ and _ lsst_. * * understanding the redshift evolution of scaling relations .",
    "* from the theoretical point of view , it is clear that high - redshift scaling relations ( or the lack thereof ) between smbh and their hosts provide unique and powerful constraints to models for agn feeding and feedback , which can not be otherwise distinguished ( see e.g. merloni et al.@xcite and references therein ) .",

    "in addition , power , nayakshin , & king @xcite suggest an alternative sub - resolution model based on an ` accretion particle ' to provide a more accurate estimate of the black hole accretion rate . the implementation of improved sub - resolution models for accretion rate and feedback into cosmological hydrodynamic simulations , as well as further improvements to the sub - resolution models , will result in more accurate predicted bhmfs , allowing a more insightful comparison with empirical bhmfs .    in this paper",
    "we have reviewed current estimates of the smbh mass function , as well as theoretical models for the bhmf . as discussed above , each of the methods for estimating the bhmf has their own set of systematics . in figure",
    "[ f - compare ] we compare the empirical estimates of the local bhmf ( defined by the shaded region in figure [ f - local_bhmf ] ) with the bhmfs predicted by the theoretical models compiled in figure [ f - theory ] . in addition , in figure [ f - compare ] we also compare the empirical bhmfs at @xmath94 , as estimated using the lightcurve method ( shown in figure [ f - lcurve ] ) and the black hole fundamental plane ( shown in figure [ f - mh08_bhmf ] ) , with bhmfs predicted by the theoretical models . in both figures",
    "we also include the bhmfs for broad line agn as estimated by schulze & wisotzki @xcite and kelly et al .",
    "@xcite . in general",
    ", the theoretical models are consistent to within a factor of a few with the empirical estimates of the bhmf , although there is a large spread in the models and empirical estimates at @xmath94 .",
    "moreover , the estimated number densities of broad line agn are significantly lower than those of all smbhs , suggesting that only a small fraction of smbhs are active across a broad range in @xmath0 , except for possibly smbhs at @xmath120 with @xmath105 .    despite the differences in the methods for estimating the bhmf , and the theoretical models",
    ", they have lead to a number of common conclusions .",
    "in particular , the empirical results have presented a picture whereby smbhs grow primarily via accretion in active phases ( eddington ratios @xmath121 ) , that quasar activity is a relatively short - lived phenomenon relative to the lifetime of the smbh and host galaxy ( i.e. , small ` duty cycles ' for agn activity ) , and that smbh growth is anti - hierarchical with the most massive end of the bhmf being built up first .",
    "these empirical results are qualitatively in agreement with the steadily improving theoretical models .",
