    "the rare weak decays of @xmath0 mesons are governed by the flavour changing neutral current . in the standard model",
    "their description requires calculation of the loop ( penguin ) diagrams .",
    "thus such decays are very sensitive to the intermediate contributions of the new particles and interactions .",
    "the accurate theoretical evaluation and experimental measurement of their decay rates can significantly constrain the `` new physics '' models .",
    "theoretical investigation of these rare decays is usually based on the effective hamiltonian in which intermediate gauge bosons are integrated out .",
    "application of the operator product expansion allows one to separate short- and long - distance effects which are assumed to factorize .",
    "the short - distance contributions are described by the wilson coefficients which are calculated perturbatively .",
    "the long - distance part is attributed to the set of the operators , which matrix elements between initial and final meson states are usually parametrized by the set of the invariant form factors .",
    "the calculation of these form factors requires application of the nonperturbative methods .",
    "thus the improvement of the theoretical understanding of the rare decays requires the precise control of hadronic uncertainties .",
    "the characteristic feature of the rare semileptonic @xmath0 decays is a very broad kinematical range .",
    "therefore the reliable determination of the momentum transfer dependence of the form factors turn out to be very important .",
    "various theoretical approaches have been applied for the form factor calculations . however , in most of such approaches the decay form factors are determined in some specific kinematic point or interval and then they are extrapolated to the whole kinematical range using some model parametrizations or additional assumptions .",
    "thus in the region of the large recoil of the final meson light - cone qcd sum rules can be applied , while the region of small recoils is accessible to lattice qcd .",
    "most of quark models determine form factors at the single point of zero or maximum recoil and then the gaussian or pole extrapolations are applied .",
    "therefore the calculation of the form factors in the whole kinematical range in the framework of the same approach without additional assumptions or / and extrapolations is highly important .    from the experimental side",
    "significant progress has been achieved in last years @xcite .",
    "not only several rare @xmath0 decays have been observed for the first time and their branching fractions were measured , but also first attempt have been made for measuring the differential branching fraction and longitudinal polarization fraction of the @xmath1 meson in the rare semileptonic @xmath2 decay @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the rare weak @xmath0 transition form factors and decay rates in the framework of the relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach in quantum chromoynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it was previously successfully applied for evaluating the charmfull and charmless semileptonic @xmath0 decay form factors @xcite .",
    "rare semileptonic decays of @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons were studied by us in ref .",
    "this model consistently takes relativistic effects into account .",
    "it allows us to express the form factors of the transition matrix elements through the overlap integrals of the meson wave functions .",
    "such expressions are valid in the whole kinematical range and thus do not require additional assumptions or extrapolations .",
    "the meson wave functions are known in our model from the previous mass spectra calculations @xcite . on the basis of the form factors",
    "we then consider the rare semileptonic , radiative and nonleptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ rqm ] we briefly describe our relativistic quark model paying special attention to the method of the calculation of the transition matrix element of the weak current . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ffbsphi ] using this approach we calculate the form factors of the rear weak @xmath5 transitions .",
    "the momentum transfer dependence of the form factors is determined explicitly and the approximate parametrizations of the form factors are given . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rard ] these form factors are used for consideration of the rare semileptonic @xmath6 decays .",
    "the @xmath7 decays are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : bsnu ] .",
    "section  [ sec : rrad ] contains results for the rare radiative decays . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonl ] rare nonleptonic @xmath0 decays to a charmonium state and a light meson as well as to two light mesons are calculated in the framework of the factorization approximation .",
    "all obtained results are confronted with previous predictions and available experimental data .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "for further calculations we use the relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in our model hadrons are considered as the bound states of constituent quarks which are described by the single - time wave functions satisfying the three - dimensional relativistically invariant schrdinger - like equation with the qcd - motivated quark - antiquark potential @xcite @xmath8 where the relativistic reduced mass is @xmath9 @xmath10 is the meson mass , @xmath11 are the quark masses , and @xmath12 is their relative momentum . in the center of mass system",
    "the relative momentum squared on mass shell @xmath13 is expressed through the meson and quark masses : @xmath14[m^2-(m_1-m_2)^2]}{4m^2}.\\ ] ] the quark - antiquark quasipotential @xmath15 is assumed to be the sum of the perturbative one - gluon exchange term and the nonperturbative confining part @xcite @xmath16 with @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the qcd coupling constant , @xmath19 is the gluon propagator in the coulomb gauge , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the dirac matrices and spinors , respectively .",
    "the confining part consists from the lorentz scalar and vector linearly rising interactions which in the nonrelativistic limit reduce to @xmath22 with @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mixing coefficient .",
    "its value @xmath25 has been determined from the comparison of the heavy quark expansion for the semileptonic @xmath26 decays in our model @xcite with model - independent predictions of heavy quark effective theory and from the consideration of charmonium radiative decays @xcite .",
    "note that in the nonrelativistic limit the quasipotential ( [ qpot ] ) reproduces the well - known cornell potential .",
    "therefore this quasipotential provides its relativistic generalization .",
    "the long - range vector vertex @xmath27 contains the pauli term with anomalous chromomagnetic quark moment @xmath28 . the value @xmath29 is fixed in our model from the analysis of the fine splitting of heavy quarkonia @xmath30- states @xcite and the heavy quark expansion for semileptonic decays of heavy mesons @xcite and baryons @xcite and enables vanishing of the spin - dependent chromomagnetic interaction , proportional to @xmath31 , in accord with the flux tube model .",
    "other parameters of our model were determined from the previous analysis of meson spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the constituent quark masses are @xmath32 gev , @xmath33 gev , @xmath34 gev , @xmath35 gev and the parameters of the linear potential are @xmath36 gev@xmath37 and @xmath38 gev .",
    "the calculation of the branching fractions of rear weak decays requires evaluation of the transition matrix elements of the weak current @xmath39 between meson states . in the quasipotential approach such matrix element between a @xmath0 meson with mass @xmath40 and momentum @xmath41 and a final @xmath42 ( @xmath43 or @xmath1 ) meson with mass @xmath44 and momentum @xmath45",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the two - particle vertex function and @xmath48 are the meson ( @xmath49 wave functions projected onto the positive energy states of quarks and boosted to the moving reference frame with momentum @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are relative quark momenta .    .",
    "[ d1 ] ]    .",
    "bold lines denote the negative - energy part of the quark propagator .",
    "dashed lines correspond to the exchange by the effective potential @xmath52 ( [ qpot ] ) .",
    "[ d2 ] ]    the vertex function @xmath53 contains @xcite contributions both from the leading order spectator diagram ( fig .",
    "[ d1 ] ) and from subleading order diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ d2 ] ) accounting for the contributions of the negative - energy intermediate states .",
    "the leading order vertex function @xmath54 contains the @xmath55 function which allows us to take one of the integrals in the matrix element ( [ mxet ] ) and thus to reduce it to the standard overlap integral of meson wave functions .",
    "the subleading order contribution is significantly more complicated @xmath56 where @xmath57 ; @xmath58 it depends in a very complicated way on the relative momenta of quarks which enter the energies of the initial heavy and final light quarks . for the heavy quark energy the heavy quark expansion can be applied . for the light quark",
    "such expansion is not valid .",
    "however , the final light @xmath42 meson possesses a large recoil momentum ( @xmath59  gev ) , with respect to the mean relative quark momentum @xmath60 in the meson ( @xmath61  gev ) , almost in the whole kinematical range except the small region near @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "this observation allows one to neglect @xmath60 compared to @xmath64 in the light quark energy @xmath65 , replacing it by @xmath66 in expressions for the subleading contribution .",
    "such replacement removes the relative momentum dependence in the energies of quarks and thus permits to perform one of the integrations in the subleading contribution using the quasipotential equation .",
    "since the subleading contributions are additionally suppressed by the ratio of the small binding energy to the large total energy of the meson , the uncertainty introduced by such procedure is small . as the result",
    "the weak decay matrix element is expressed through the usual overlap integral of initial and final meson wave functions and its momentum dependence can be determined in the whole accessible kinematical range without additional assumptions .    it is important to point out that initial and final mesons in the considered rare decay are moving with respect to each other .",
    "this fact should be taken into account in calculating the decay matrix element ( [ mxet ] ) . if calculations are done in the @xmath0 meson rest frame ( @xmath67 ) then the final meson is moving with the recoil momentum @xmath68 . in the quasipotential approach the wave function of the moving meson @xmath69",
    "is connected with the wave function in the rest frame @xmath70 by the relativistic transformation @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the wigner rotation , @xmath73 is the lorentz boost to a moving reference frame and @xmath74 is the spin rotation matrix .",
    "the matrix elements of the flavour changing neutral currents , governing rare @xmath76 weak transitions , between initial @xmath0 meson and final @xmath77 or @xmath1 mesons are usually parametrized by the following set of the invariant form factors @xmath78 +    f_0(q^2)\\frac{m_{b_s}^2-m_{\\eta}^2}{q^2}\\ q^\\mu,\\ ] ] @xmath79 @xmath80,\\ ] ] @xmath81 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath82 @xmath83\\cr\\cr & & + t_3(q^2)(\\epsilon^*\\cdot q)\\left[q^\\mu-\\frac{q^2}{m_{b_s}^2-m_{\\varphi}^2 }    ( p_{b_s}^\\mu+p_{\\varphi}^\\mu)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] were @xmath84 is the momentum transfer , @xmath85 are the initial and final meson masses , and @xmath86 is the polarization vector of the final vector @xmath1 meson .    at the maximum recoil point ( @xmath87 )",
    "these form factors satisfy the following conditions : @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90    the physical pseudoscalar @xmath77 and @xmath91 mesons are the mixtures of @xmath92 and @xmath93 states @xmath94 for the calculations we use the experimental value of the mixing angle @xmath95 @xcite and neglect the possible glue content in these mesons .",
    "the wave functions of @xmath96 and @xmath97 mesons are known in our model from previous light meson mass spectra investigations @xcite .",
    "the calculated masses of the pure @xmath96 and @xmath97 are @xmath98  mev and @xmath99  mev @xcite , while the masses of the mixed states @xmath77 and @xmath91 are close to the experimental values .",
    "now we compare the form factor decompositions ( [ eq : pff1])([eq : vff4 ] ) with the results of the calculations of the weak current matrix element in our model , based on the methods described in the previous section .",
    "this allows us to explicitly determine the form factors in the whole accessible kinematical range through the overlap integrals of the meson wave functions .",
    "the corresponding expressions can be found in refs .  @xcite . for the numerical evaluations of the overlap integrals we use the quasipotential wave functions of @xmath0 and @xmath75 mesons previously obtained in their mass spectra studies @xcite .",
