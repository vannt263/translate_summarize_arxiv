    "recently , there have been a number of experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite investigations of the integer and fractional quantum hall effects in double - quantum - well systems ( dqws ) .",
    "the additional degree of freedom due to the presence of the second well makes the phase diagram of the two - dimensional electron gas in the dqws very rich .",
    "technological progress has opened the possibility of producing dqws s of very high mobility where the spacing between the wells is small enough ( @xmath0 ) to be comparable with the typical electron spacing within a layer . in this regime a dqws may differ qualitatively from a pair of isolated single - layer systems .",
    "in particular , theoretical work based on several apparently different points of view has established@xcite that for sufficiently small separations , a novel broken symmetry can occur in dqws s in a strong perpendicular magnetic field in which phase coherence exists between electrons in different layers even when no tunneling occurs .",
    "this broken symmetry is favored by interlayer electron - electron interactions because good interlayer correlations are guaranteed by the pauli exclusion principle when the phase difference between the two layers is fixed .",
    "( if the phase relationship is fixed , two electrons can not share the same planar coordinate even if they are in opposite layers . )",
    "the broken symmetry occurs at strong perpendicular magnetic fields because landau level degeneracy allows the symmetry to be broken without a kinetic energy cost .",
    "the broken symmetry is expected to exist in the ground state for layer separation , @xmath1 , smaller than a critical layer separation , @xmath2 . moreover , for @xmath3 the system is expected@xcite to have a finite temperature phase transition of the kosterlitz - thouless type .    for realistic dqws s with @xmath3",
    "there is always a finite amplitude for tunneling between the two layers of the dqws .",
    "tunneling favors a particular phase relationship between electrons in opposite layers so that the symmetry discussed above is explicitly broken by the tunneling term in the hamiltonian and the kosterlitz - thouless phase transition associated with its breaking does not occur .",
    "however , recent experiments@xcite have demonstrated that a second related quantum phase transition occurs in dqws s when the magnetic field is tilted away from the normal to the layers of the dqws .",
    "when the component of the magnetic field which is parallel to the electron layers is finite , electrons must acquire an aharonov - bohm phase when they move around paths which enclose flux from the parallel field .",
    "in one convenient gauge , the aharonov - bohm phase appears through phase factors in the interlayer tunneling amplitudes which depend on the planar coordinate which is perpendicular to the in - plane component of the magnetic field .",
    "the tunneling term in the hamiltonian then favors a phase relationship between electrons in opposite layers which follows the phase of the tunneling amplitude .",
    "when the phase relationship is spatially dependent it becomes possible for electrons in opposite layers to share the same planar coordinate so that the interaction energy increases .",
    "according to yang",
    "_ et al._@xcite the phase transition seen by murphy _ et al._@xcite results from this competition between tunneling energy and interaction energy in a parallel field . in the simplest view",
    ", the state on the small parallel field side of the transition is one where the phase relationship between the layers follows the phase of the tunneling amplitude while the state on the large parallel field side of the transition is one in which the phase is independent of the spatial coordinate and the symmetry - breaking tunneling term has no effect on the ground - state energy of the dqws . a more accurate picture of this state and of the phase transition follows from the effective hamiltonian derived by yang _",
    "_ in which the local interaction energy cost of spatial dependence in the phase relationship between the layers is approximated by a gradient term in the energy density . minimizing the energy in a parallel field",
    "then gives rise to a sine - gordon equation .",
    "the state on the large parallel field side of this transition is a soliton - lattice state@xcite which has its translational symmetry broken by the introduction of periodic kinks in the phase relationship between electrons in the two wells of the dqws as the parallel magnetic field is increased .",
    "the effective hamiltonian derived by yang _",
    "_ may be mapped to thoroughly studied models ( see for example refs.@xcite ) of commensurate - incommensurate phase transitions with the parameter which tunes the transition proportional to the parallel component of the magnetic field ( see below ) .",
    "motivated by this mapping , we refer to the state on the weak parallel field side of the transition as the commensurate state and to the state in the absence of tunneling as the incommensurate state .",
    "in this paper we use a generalized random - phase approximation ( grpa ) to study the response functions and collective modes of the soliton - lattice state .",
    "as discussed elsewhere@xcite and in further details below , the grpa is expected to be qualitatively correct for dqws s at total landau level filling factor @xmath4 .",
    "it is at this filling factor that the physical effects associated with spontaneous phase coherence are most easily observed .",
    "the use of a microscopic theory frees us from the gradient approximation and , more importantly , allows us to study higher energy excitations which may not be accurately rendered by the effective hamiltonian . in section",
    "ii , we detail the microscopic hamiltonian on which we base our calculations .",
    "we appeal to the strong perpendicular magnetic field in limiting the hilbert space to the lowest landau level in each layer and assume that the electrons are completely spin polarized .",
    "grpa response functions are readily calculated from the hartree - fock approximation ground state of the dqws . in section iii",
    ", we outline the hartree - fock formalism which allows us to describe both the simpler commensurate state and the more intricate soliton - lattice state .",
    "numerical hartree - fock approximation results for the ground state are compared with expectations based on the gradient approximation effective hamiltonian and with the theory of commensurate - incommensurate phase transitions . at strong parallel magnetic fields corrections",
    "are quantitatively important .",
    "we discuss results for the period of the soliton - lattice , the shape of individual solitons , and the ground - state energy .",
    "we show explicitly that the soliton - lattice state always has lower energy than the incommensurate phase , although the energy difference is extremely small at very strong parallel magnetic fields .",
    "we also calculate the critical strength of parallel magnetic field at which the phase transition between commensurate and soliton - lattice states occurs . in section",
    "iv we describe the grpa calculations .",
    "the response functions of the soliton - lattice state are complicated by its broken translational symmetry but we are able to derive formal results which are convenient for numerical calculations by taking advantage of simplifications which are due to the truncation of the hilbert space to the lowest landau level .",
    "the formalism is a generalization to double - layers of one developed@xcite to describe the wigner crystal state of single layer systems in strong perpendicular magnetic fields and has been applied previously@xcite to double - layer systems in the case where there is no parallel field .",
    "we find that the lowest energy collective modes are goldstone modes associated with the broken translational symmetry of the soliton - lattice state .",
    "collective modes occur at higher energies which are closely related to the goldstone modes of the phase - coherent broken - symmetry state in the absence of tunneling between the layers .",
    "we comment on the possibility of using a parallel magnetic field to generate a finite wave vector probe of the coherent broken symmetry state .",
    "section v contains a brief summary of our results .",
    "we consider a symmetric dqws subjected to a tilted magnetic field .",
    "we are interested in studying the ground - state properties of this system as a function of both the parallel component of the magnetic field and the separation @xmath1 ( from center to center ) between the wells at filling factor @xmath5 .",
    "we assume throughout this paper that the perpendicular component of the magnetic field is kept constant .",
    "the total field is taken as @xmath6 and , in the landau gauge , the vector potential @xmath7*. * we consider only the case of an unbiased dqws : the subband energies in the two layers are identical and , in the ground state , the charge is equally distributed between the two layers .    taking the perpendicular component of the magnetic field to be strong , we restrict the hilbert space to the first landau level and assume the electron gas to be fully spin polarized .",
    "the many - body hilbert space then consists of occupation number states based on a set of single - particle orbitals labeled by a layer index @xmath8 and a guiding center index @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the square of the magnetic length for the _ perpendicular _ component of the magnetic field and @xmath12 with @xmath13 is the envelope wave function of the lowest - energy state centered on the right or left well .",
    "we can define a separate magnetic length associated with the parallel component of the magnetic field , @xmath14 . in the absence of interactions and tunneling between the wells these single particle orbitals are eigenstates of the single - particle hamiltonian .    for the sake of limiting the number of parameters characterizing our dqws",
    ", we make a narrow well approximation _",
    "i.e. _ we assume that the width , @xmath15 , of the wells is small ( @xmath16 ) and treat interlayer hopping in a tight - binding@xcite approximation .",
    "the single - particle problem is then characterized by the interlayer distance @xmath1 and a hopping integral @xmath17 : @xmath18 in this approximation , the parallel component of the magnetic field is responsible for a reduction@xcite in the magnitude of the hopping integral ( @xmath19 ) and for the introduction of a guiding - center - dependent phase factor , @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the identical subband energy of the quantum wells ( including the lowest landau - level energy @xmath22 , where @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 is defined by @xmath25 the parallel component of the magnetic field enters only in the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian but , as we will see , the competition it produces with the interaction energy leads to interesting many - body physics .",
    "in order to evaluate the grpa response functions we must first complete self - consistent hartree - fock calculations for the ground state of the dqws . the order parameters that describe",
    "the commensurate and soliton - lattice states are defined below and we compute them using the formalism developed in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "although this approach is not the simplest approach one could use in the present context , it has the advantage of being easy to implement numerically .",
    "more importantly , the results we derive here will lead to a remarkable simplification of the grpa response function calculations .",
    "we start be defining the operator @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the degeneracy of the landau levels ( @xmath28 is the area of the system ) .",
    "the single - particle hartree - fock hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of this operator .",
    "defining @xmath29 we obtain @xmath30 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 are respectively the hartree intrawell and interwell interactions and the fock intrawell and interwell interactions .",
    "these functions of wave vector depend only on the interlayer separation and are plotted in ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath32 is a bessel function of the first kind and @xmath33is the `` density '' operator . in deriving these results",
    "we have neglected processes in which electrons are scattered from one well to the other as the result of their mutual interactions .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the tight - binding approximation . in realistic systems , small terms of this type",
    "will be present but they do not add anything new to the physics .",
    "these equations are very general and allow both positional and coherence broken symmetries .",
    "the set of quantities @xmath34 describes all possible states of the dqws and we use them as order parameters : @xmath35 and @xmath36 describe density fluctuations in each well while the interwell coherence is reflected in a non - zero value of the interwell order parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 . the states that we consider here are ones where the electron density is uniform in each well , but the interwell order parameters are allowed to vary in space along the @xmath39 axis",
    "we do not allow variation in the interwell order parameters along the @xmath40 direction . in our notation , we restrict ourselves to solutions of the hartree - fock equations where @xmath41 and all other order parameters are zero .",
    "it seems clear that the lowest - energy solution of the hartree - fock equations satisfies these restrictions for the situations of physical interest to us .",
    "the restriction that @xmath42 is enforced by the large hartree energy cost of having unequal densities in the two layers .",
    "the only spatial dependence which we allow is that driven by the hopping term in the hamiltonian which depends on the @xmath39 coordinate . in the absence of a parallel field , we know@xcite that the minimum - energy solution of the hartree - fock equations is spatially uniform at small layer separations but breaks translational symmetry by forming a wigner crystal state at sufficiently large layer separations .",
    "once the wigner crystal state is formed , interlayer coherence is quickly lost . for @xmath43 the occurrence of a wigner crystal state is believed to be an artifact of the hartree - fock approximation . in any event , our present interest is in the regime of small layer separations where we do not expect spatial dependence other than that driven by the parallel field ; here we are confident that the lowest - energy hartree - fock state satisfies the restrictions of eq .",
    "(  [ ahuit ] ) . with these restrictions",
    "the hartree - fock hamiltonian simplifies : @xmath44 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 .",
    "to arrive at eq.([aneuf ] ) , we have added a neutralizing positive background ; the energy @xmath21 appearing in eq.([aneuf ] ) now depends on the location of this background in three dimensional space . for constant perpendicular magnetic field , the first term in the right - hand - side of eq.([aneuf ] ) is a constant which we absorb into the zero of energy in what follows .",
    "the hartree - fock hamiltonian depends on order parameters which must be determined self - consistently .",
    "we now derive explicit self - consistent equations by considering the equation of motion of the single - particle green s function defined by @xmath46 . within the restricted hartree - fock approximation discussed above",
    ", the single - particle green s function is diagonal in its guiding center indices and we can work@xcite with a one - component fourier transform defined by @xmath47 the order parameters are related to this green s function by @xmath48 the equation of motion of the green s function is derived using @xmath49 $ ] where @xmath50 is the chemical potential of the electron gas and we set @xmath51 .",
    "we find that @xmath52 where the effective hartree - fock mean field is due to the interlayer exchange energy and is given by @xmath53    our restricted hartree - fock equations do not couple different guiding centers .",
    "since we require that the charge density in each layer be uniform and independent of position , it follows that for the hartree fock eigenfunctions at guiding center @xmath9 , the magnitudes of the coefficients multiplying the basis functions localized in left and right wells must be equal .",
    "the only freedom of physical relevance is the relative phase , @xmath54 , multiplying the basis functions . in terms of this quantity ,",
    "@xmath55 \\ e^{-iq_xx},\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the interwell order parameter in @xmath9 space .    at this point , it is more convenient@xcite to define a new phase @xmath57 by @xmath58 in the commensurate state , @xmath59 , while in the soliton - lattice state it is a periodic function of @xmath9 .",
    "it is advantageous to make use of this periodicity and redefine the interwell order parameter as @xmath60 which is the fourier transform of @xmath61 .    in our notation",
    "the commensurate - incommensurate phase transition of ref.@xcite is described in the following way .",
    "the _ commensurate _ phase ( c phase ) at weak parallel magnetic fields has @xmath62 ; the phase of the wavefunction follows the phase of the hopping matrix element just as it would for non - interacting electrons .",
    "for this state @xmath63 and so only @xmath64 is different from zero .",
    "the commensurate phase has an energy per particle @xmath65 which increases monotonically with magnetic field . in the opposite limit of strong parallel magnetic fields",
    ", the phase does not follow the imposed periodicity and we expect @xmath66 .",
    "thus , @xmath67 or , equivalently , only @xmath68 is non - zero .",
    "the energy per particle in the _ incommensurate _ phase ( i phase ) is @xmath69 and is clearly independent of the parallel magnetic field .",
    "there is a critical parallel magnetic field @xmath70 at which the energy of the commensurate state rises above the energy of the incommensurate state . as pointed out in ref.@xcite , however , before this critical magnetic field is reached it becomes energetically favorable to introduce kinks ( solitons ) where @xmath71 changes by @xmath72 ; in the ground state the solitons are arranged periodically .",
    "we refer to this state as the _ soliton - lattice _ state ( s phase ) . for very strong parallel magnetic fields",
    "the solitons are smooth and spaced by @xmath73 so that @xmath74 and the soliton - lattice state asymptotically approaches the incommensurate state . in ref.@xcite",
    "this phase transition is described using a gradient approximation for the exchange energy which allows the ground - state problem to be mapped to well - studied models of commensurate - incommensurate phase transitions@xcite . in the appendix , we briefly review the most relevant results from these models and discuss the relationship between the gradient - approximation theory for the ground state and the hartree - fock approximation . at the critical parallel field for the transition between commensurate and soliton - lattice states , @xmath75 , the system admits a single soliton and @xmath76 is a solution of the sine - gordon equation .",
    "( see the appendix for further details . ) as the parallel magnetic field increases above this transition , the solitons proliferate and it is necessary to take their interactions into account .",

    "analytic results from the gradient approximation for the the values of @xmath24 at which the commensurate and incommensurate states are equal in energy ( @xmath121 ) and at which the soliton state first becomes stable ( @xmath122 ) are also in good agreement with the the hf values .",
    "numerically , we find that for ( a ) @xmath123 , and for ( b ) @xmath124 while in the gradient approximation , this ratio is @xmath125 .",
    "we also see in fig .  1 that the energy of the soliton phase is always lower than the energy of the incommensurate phase so that this phase is never thermodynamically stable in the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "of course , as @xmath24 becomes very large , the order parameters in the soliton phase become asymptotically close to those of the @xmath126 phase and the energies of the two phases becomes nearly identical .",

    "this value is about @xmath145 times greater than that of the experiment ( @xmath146 ) . as discussed elsewhere@xcite",

    "in fact , as discussed in ref.@xcite , this coupling is due to the magnetic field and technically arises because we have restricted the hilbert space to the first landau level only . in the restricted hilbert space ,",
    "pseudospin and charge operators no longer commute and it follows that modulations of the pseudospin texture are in general accompanied by modulations of the charge density .",

    "to which we turn next and , which has gapless collective modes , this coupling is also present .",

    "the renormalization of the particle - hole excitation is more dramatic than in the commensurate phase .",
    "in addition to a goldstone mode which appears at low energies , a number of additional sharp peaks suggestive of further collective modes appear in the response functions . for wave vectors in the @xmath39 direction and parallel fields close to that of the commensurate to soliton lattice phase transition ,",

    "wave vectors in the @xmath225 direction the goldstone modes in this regime are best thought of as oscillations in the position of a particular phase slip as a function of the @xmath225 coordinate .",

    "the effect of the tunneling on the spontaneously - coherent ground state is very much like the effect of a grating with wavevector @xmath24 .",
    "we are presently investigating the possibility@xcite of using tunneling in a parallel field as a tunable grating which allows light to couple to finite wave vector modes of the spontaneously phase - coherent state in much the same way that artificially generated metallic gratings are used to couple to finite wave vector plasmons of two - dimensional electron systems.@xcite finally , we have verified that the pseudospin - charge coupling that we discussed in the commensurate phase also appears in the soliton phase . however , the pseudospin - charge coupling is very small .",
    "typically , the density response function is more than one - thousand times smaller than the pseudospin response functions @xmath236 or @xmath237 .",
    "the weight of the goldstone mode in the density response function ( as in all other response functions ) vanishes as the wave vector of the excitation vanishes .",
    "further studies will be needed to understand how this coupling affects the ground - state conductivity of the soliton lattice .",
    "we have studied the commensurate - incommensurate phase transition which appears in a dqws in a strong magnetic field when the field is tilted away from the normal to the planes of the two - dimensional electron gas in each well .",
    "working in the hartree - fock approximation , we have calculated the energy of the soliton - lattice state for different values of the tunneling parameter and parallel magnetic field and found that the soliton - lattice state is the ground - state of the system for all angles greater than the critical tilt angle .",
    "the difference in energy between the soliton - lattice state and the incommensurate state is however very small .",
    "close to the commensurate - soliton lattice transition , we find that the gradient approximation described in ref.@xcite is a good approximation for the soliton - lattice energy and for the modulation of the interlayer coherence phase .",
    "this approximation soon breaks down , however , as the parallel magnetic field is increased .    using the grpa ,",
    "we have also studied the collective modes of the soliton lattice . as expected from the broken translational symmetry of the soliton lattice",
    ", there is a goldstone mode branch which represents the phonons of the soliton lattice . because of the one - dimensional character of the brillouin zone , the goldstone mode dispersion relation is periodic only in the direction perpendicular to the parallel magnetic field . beside the goldstone mode",
    ", there are also higher - energy collective excitations in the response functions calculated in the grpa . in the limit of strong parallel magnetic fields",
    ", we were able to relate these higher - energy excitations to the collective modes of the spontaneously - coherent state in the absence of tunneling at wavevectors displaced by multiples of @xmath238 .",
    "in this regime , the effect of tunneling in a parallel field resembles that of a finite - wave - vector grating which mixes the different modes of the spontaneously coherent state .",
    "finally , we have also shown that , except in the direction perpendicular to the parallel magnetic field , the collective modes in the system are in fact mixed pseudospin - charge excitations . since all response functions are coupled in the soliton lattice , it follows that the density response function has poles at exactly the frequency of these mixed pseudospin - charge excitations ( including the goldstone mode ) .",
