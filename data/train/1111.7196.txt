    "the mass @xmath6 reaction residues can now result from two distinct mechanisms : single - step direct knockout of a pair of neutrons and one - neutron knockout followed by neutron emission from excited particle - unbound states of the intermediate mass @xmath4 residue .",
    "the latter will be populated with cross sections that are typically an order of magnitude or more larger than those for the direct pair removal .",

    "state cases our one - neutron removal model calculates the exclusive parallel momentum distributions of the ( weakly ) unbound @xmath1c and @xmath15c residues in the original projectile rest frame .",
    "the subsequent in - flight neutron emission from these excited states will generate additional ( recoil ) broadening of the momentum distributions of the observed mass @xmath6 residues , i.e. , @xmath54c and @xmath2c .",
    "the degree of broadening will be dependent on the continuum energy of the unbound , mass @xmath4 intermediate state , denoted @xmath104 .",

    "the momentum @xmath22 of the heavy decay residue in this frame satisfies @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the @xmath6 residue - neutron reduced mass . the assumption that this two - body decay is isotropic then requires that the calculated parallel momentum distributions of the unbound mass @xmath4 fragments must be convoluted with a rectangular distribution , of unit integral and total width @xmath107 , to derive the mass @xmath6 fragment parallel momentum distributions .",

    "the very narrow momentum distribution and relatively low cross section for c(@xmath2c,@xmath1c ) arises as the single - neutron removal to the @xmath1c(1/2@xmath99 ) ground state probes specifically the significant @xmath9 component of the @xmath2c ground state .",
    "the @xmath120 component results in the population of unbound states in @xmath1c that neutron decay to @xmath54c .",
    "the narrow momentum distribution and enhanced cross section for c(@xmath1c,@xmath54c ) are consistent with the well developed @xmath121 halo of @xmath1c .",
    "overall , the calculated cross sections agreed well with those measured . in particular , in the cases of c(@xmath1c,@xmath54c ) , c(@xmath2c,@xmath1c ) , and c(@xmath3c,@xmath2c ) , @xmath122 was close to unity and consistent with systematics @xcite .",
    "combined with the good agreement for the momentum distributions , it may be seen that the shell - model has predictive power in this region and provides a good overall description of level positions and their spectroscopic strengths .    in the case of weakly - bound two - neutron removal ,",
    "fully - correlated , direct removal cross sections were also calculated .",
    "it was shown that two - neutron removal is dominated by the two - step process ; that is , one - neutron removal followed by neutron decay of the unbound intermediate state(s ) . in the cases of two - neutron removal from @xmath84c ,",
    "the direct removal contribution was computed to be of order 8% or less of the two - step process ; consistent with an earlier work @xcite .",
