    "possible occurrence of spin - triplet pairing in superconductors such as a ruthenate sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1@xcite and organic materials ( tmtsf)@xmath0x ( x = clo@xmath1 , pf@xmath7 ... ) @xcite has attracted much attention lately .",
    "a probable mechanism of spin - triplet pairing is due to ferromagnetic spin fluctuations , as in @xmath8he , as proposed in ref . for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "in both of these materials , however , the mechanism of triplet pairing has been controversial because the spin fluctuation has turned out to be more like antiferromagnetic than ferromagnetic .",
    "namely in ( tmtsf)@xmath0x , the nesting of the quasi-1d fermi surface give rise to a @xmath9 spin density wave phase lying right next to the superconducting phase . in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ,",
    "spin fluctuations with a wave number @xmath10 arises due to the nesting of the quasi-1d @xmath11 and @xmath12 bands.@xcite    for ( tmtsf)@xmath0x , the possibility of spin triplet @xmath5-wave pairing has been considered from the early days,@xcite but if we consider the @xmath9 spin fluctuations to be the origin of the pairing interaction , spin singlet @xmath6-wave - like pairing is more likely to occur as proposed by several authors.@xcite recently , two of the present authors have proposed , based on a phenomelogical spin - charge fluctuation theory , that a combination of quasi - one - dimensionality , the coexistence of @xmath9 spin and charge fluctuations , and anisotropy in the spin fluctuations may lead to spin - triplet @xmath4-wave pairing , dominating over @xmath6- and @xmath5-wave pairings.@xcite a similar proposal has been made by fuseya et al.@xcite in fact , the coexistence of @xmath9 spin and charge density wave has been reported experimentally.@xcite however , a recent renormalization group study by fuseya _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has suggested that @xmath5-wave pairing dominates over @xmath4-wave pairing in quasi-1d systems .    for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 on the other hand ,",
    "there has been a debate as to which one of the three bands plays the main role in the occurrence of superconductivity , namely the 2d @xmath2 bands or the quasi-1d @xmath11-@xmath12 bands .",
    "several microscopic theories have focused on the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations due to the @xmath11-@xmath12 band fermi surface nesting.@xcite in refs.- in particular , the experimentally observed anisotropy @xcite in the spin fluctuations is the key for spin - triplet @xmath5-wave pairing to take place .",
    "on the other hand , nomura and yamada focused mainly on the 2d @xmath2 band.@xcite applying third order perturbation theory to the 2d hubbard model with appropriate band structure and band filling , they showed that triplet pairing superconductivity takes place , dominating over singlet pairing .",
    "a multiband calculation has recently been performed along this line.@xcite also , a renormalization group study has been performed for the hubbard model having nearest neighbor hopping , where spin triplet pairing is shown to be the leading instability near but away from the van hove filling.@xcite by contrast , if we apply random phase approximation ( rpa ) type theories like the fluctuation exchange method ( flex)@xcite to the 2d hubbard model , triplet pairing not only does not occur in a realistic temperature regime,@xcite but also does not even dominate over singlet pairing at the filling corresponding to the @xmath2 band of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ( see section[vd ] ) .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to shed light into these controversies .",
    "we model ( tmtsf)@xmath0x and sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 by quasi-1d and 2d hubbard models , respectively . using the ground state quantum monte carlo technique ,",
    "we calculate the pairing interaction vertices for possible pairing symmetries .",
    "before going into the qmc calculation , here we summarize the spin - charge fluctuation theory of quasi-1d systems given in ref .. the pairing interactions mediated by spin and charge fluctuations are generally given as @xmath13 for singlet pairing , @xmath14 for triplet pairing with total @xmath15 ( @xmath6-vector @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 for triplet pairing with @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "here @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ( all positive ) are contributions from the longitudinal spin , transverse spin , and charge fluctuations , respectively .",
    "we assume that the fluctuations are enhanced at @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the nesting vector of the fermi surface . in the case of ( tmtsf)@xmath0x",
    ", @xmath24 bridges the two disconnected pieces of the quasi 1d fermi surface ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the pairing symmetry is determined so as to make the quantity @xmath25 positive and large , where @xmath26 is one of the pairing interactions ( [ 1])-([3 ] ) and @xmath27 is the gap function .",
    "when @xmath28 peaks around the nesting vector @xmath29 , the contribution around @xmath30 becomes dominant in the summation of eqn.([4 ] ) , so that the sign of the quantity @xmath31 has to be negative in order to have superconductivity .",
    "let us now consider @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath4-wave gap functions shown in fig.[fig1 ] along with the fermi surface .",
    "although the @xmath6- ( @xmath4- ) wave gap is not @xmath6 ( @xmath4 ) in the strict sense of the word , here we use this terminology in the sense that the gap changes sign as @xmath32   ( @xmath33 ) _ along the fermi surface_. since the @xmath6-wave gap function satisfies @xmath34 , a positive pairing interaction @xmath35 is necessary for superconductivity to occur in this channel .",
    "similarly @xmath36 or @xmath37 is necessary for @xmath4-wave pairing .",
    "if we assume @xmath38 , @xmath39 , so that @xmath4-wave is more likely to occur in the @xmath40 channel .",
    "since the number of nodes of the gap _ intersecting the fermi surface _ is the same between @xmath6 and @xmath4 due to the quasi - one - dimensionality , the competition between the two is almost solely dominated by the absolute value of the pairing interaction .",
    "thus the boundary between @xmath6 and @xmath4-waves is roughly given by @xmath41 , which corresponds to the line @xmath42 .",
    "in particular , when the system has spin rotational symmetry , the two symmetries become nearly degenerate when spin and charge fluctuations have about the same strength.@xcite    on the other hand , the @xmath5-wave gap function satisfies @xmath34 , so that a positive triplet pairing interaction is necessary",
    ". this can be the case only for @xmath43 and only when @xmath44 and @xmath45 are both small.@xcite since the @xmath5-wave gap function is nodeless on the fermi surface as opposed to the case of @xmath6- and @xmath4-waves , this will be the dominant pairing if the pairing interaction is positive and strong enough .    from the above phenomelogical argument",
    ", we obtain a generic phase diagram given in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "in this section , we formulate the ground state qmc study .      as a model for ( tmtsf)@xmath0x",
    ", we consider the hubbard model @xmath46 on an @xmath47 quasi-1d lattice shown in fig.[fig3](a ) .",
    "we set @xmath48 , where @xmath49 ( taken as unity throughout the study ) and @xmath50 are hopping integrals in the @xmath51 and @xmath52 directions , respectively .",
    "since the energy band is much more dispersive in the @xmath51 direction than in the @xmath52 direction , we take more sites in the former than in the latter @xmath53 . as for the electron - electron interaction , we assume only the on - site repulsion @xmath54 for simplicity , and refer to the model as the on - site hubbard model .",
    "the reason for this is to make the qmc calculation feasible .",
    "note that , @xmath54 enhances only the spin fluctuation ( @xmath55 ) , so that @xmath6-wave pairing is expected from the spin fluctuation theory@xcite as seen from the phase diagram .",
    "we take @xmath56 throughout the study .",
    "the band filling @xmath57(number of electrons @xmath58 /number of sites @xmath59 ) is taken close to quarter filling , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "as for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , we focus on the @xmath2 band and model it by the 2d single band hubbard model having nearest and next nearest neighbor hoppings , @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively , as shown in fig.[fig3](b ) .",
    "@xmath62 has been estimated to be 0.3 - 0.4 in units of @xmath63.@xcite here we take @xmath64 .",
    "the band filling is taken to be close to @xmath65 .",
    "we adopt the auxiliary field quantum monte carlo method for the ground state .",
    "@xcite in this formalism , physical quantities are evaluated using the ground state wave function obtained as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the hamiltonian , @xmath68 is a sufficiently large number , and @xmath69 is a trial state .",
    "@xmath68 is sliced into a product of many @xmath70 using trotter - suzuki decomposition.@xcite in the actual calculation , we have taken @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , which turns out to be sufficient for a relatively small value of @xmath56 .",
    "the correlation functions are evaluated as the average of the calculation results of about @xmath73 independent monte carlo runs , each of which consists of few thousand mc sweeps .",
    "the error bars are estimated as the variation of the independent runs .",
    "we calculate the pairing interaction vertex for possible pairing channels,@xcite which is defined as @xmath74 \\right .",

    "@xmath78 gives sign that depends on the pairing channel @xmath11 as given below .",
    "a positive interaction vertex in a certain pairing channel implies that there is an effective attractive pairing interaction in that channel between the _ renormalized _ quasi - particles .",
    "for the quasi-1d system , we consider the pairing channels @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath6 and @xmath4 as shown in fig.[fig4](a ) along with the signs @xmath78 .",
    "it can be easily shown that the corresponding gap functions in momentum space are proportional to @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "for the 2d system , three triplet pairings tp1 , tp2 , tp3 and a singlet pairing sp1 are considered as shown in fig.[fig4](b ) .",
    "the corresponding gap functions in momentum space are proportional to @xmath82 ( or equivalently @xmath85 ) , @xmath86 ( or @xmath87 ) , @xmath81 ( or @xmath88 ) , and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "sp1 is the so - called @xmath90 pairing .",
    "let us denote the @xmath91-th site as @xmath92 .",
    "for the quasi-1d system , we calculate @xmath93 ( pairing correlation within each chain ) as a function of distance in the @xmath51 direction @xmath94 . for the 2d system , we calculate @xmath95 as a function of the `` distance '' @xmath96 . in both systems",
    ", we focus on the long range part @xmath97 because superconductivity is characterized by the long ranged behavior of the pairing correlation function .",
    "since the energy scale of superconductivity in repulsively interacting systems is small , pairing correlations are known to be strongly affected by the energy level spacing around the fermi level in finite size systems.@xcite namely , since superconductivity occurs due to pair scattering between states near the fermi level , the enhancement of the pairing correlation can be wiped out when the energies of the highest occupied levels and the lowest unoccupied levels are well separated .    in order to cope with this problem , here we consider the following two situations .",
    "( i ) open shell fillings : the number of electrons are chosen so that the @xmath98-points at the fermi level is half - filled for the @xmath99 ground state . the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied states have the same energy in this case .",
    "we tune the value of the hopping integrals ( @xmath50 for the quasi-1d system and @xmath62 for the 2d system ) appropriately so as to distribute the @xmath98-points having the same energy as uniformly as possible along the fermi surface .    in the case of open shell fillings ,",
    "the trial state is chosen as follows .",
    "the @xmath99 single particle states ( @xmath100 ) below the fermi energy is completely filled with electrons . at the fermi energy ,",
    "the states of the form @xmath101 are filled only by up spin electrons , while the states of the form @xmath102 are filled only by down spin electrons .",
    "we will use gray circles to denote the half - filled @xmath98-points in the trial state , as shown in the inset of figs.[fig5 ] , [ fig7 ] , [ fig8 ] , and [ fig10](a ) .",
    "\\(ii ) closed shell fillings : the number of electrons is chosen so that the fermi energy for the @xmath99 ground state comes in between slightly separated energy levels . for the quasi-1d system ,",
    "@xmath50 is tuned so that the energy difference between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied levels is within @xmath103 for @xmath99 .",
    "as for the 2d system , @xmath50 is taken to be slightly different from @xmath49 thereby lifting the degeneracy , by less than @xmath103 , between the highest occupied levels @xmath104 and the lowest unoccupied levels @xmath105 .    in this case",
    "we take the @xmath99 ground state , which is a state with total spin @xmath106 , as the qmc trial state .",
    "closed ( open ) circles will be used to denote the occupied ( unoccupied ) @xmath98-points that lie within @xmath103 to the fermi energy in the trial state , as shown in the inset of figs.[fig6 ] , [ fig9 ] , and [ fig10](b ) .    for open shell fillings , triplet pairing",
    "is expected to be favored because the electrons at the half - filled fermi level tends to be in a high spin configuration .",
    "for closed shell fillings on the other hand , spin singlet pairing should be favored since we restrict ourselves to @xmath106 states by choosing the @xmath99 ground state as the trial state .",
    "this problem does make the study of singlet - triplet competition less conclusive , but our results still give significant information concerning the @xmath6- vs. @xmath4-wave competition in the on - site hubbard model as we shall see below .",
    "as for the competition _ within _ triplet pairings ( @xmath5 vs. @xmath4 ) on the other hand , we can safely give a robust conclusion .",
    "we now show the results for the quasi 1d system . we first present results for open shell fillings .",
    "the pairing interaction vertices @xmath107 are shown for three different sets of parameters in fig.[fig5 ] . in all cases , @xmath108 is found to be positive at large distances , while @xmath109 and @xmath110 are negative at most of the distances .",
    "this means that the spin - triplet pairing interaction is attractive in the @xmath4-wave channel and repulsive in the @xmath5-wave channels .",
    "this result is in contrast with the recent renormalization group study@xcite , and is at least qualitatively consistent with the spin - charge fluctuation theory described in section[spincharge ] , where @xmath111 and thus @xmath112 hold for the on - site hubbard model .",
    "the interaction vertex for @xmath6-wave pairing @xmath113 takes both positive and negative values , and we find @xmath114 at most of the large distances.@xcite this is somewhat surprising because when the system has spin rotational symmetry , @xmath4-wave can be competitive against @xmath6-wave only when @xmath9 spin and @xmath9 charge fluctuations have about the same strength as far as the spin - charge fluctuation theory is concerned,@xcite which is not the case for the on - site hubbard model.@xcite    as mentioned before , open shell filling is expected to favor spin triplet pairing , so this result may be regarded as an artifact due to the open shell filling .",
    "however , as we shall see later , open shell filling does not necessarily result in @xmath115 .",
    "another possible reason for @xmath4 dominating over @xmath6 is that effects beyond rpa - type theories may be important in quasi-1d systems .",
    "this is highly probable because fermi liquid picture is known to be invalid at least in purely 1d systems.@xcite      calculation results for a closed shell filling is shown in fig.[fig6 ] . in this case",
    ", we have positive @xmath113 , smaller but still positive ( or non - negative ) @xmath108 for all distances , and clearly negative @xmath116 .",
    "thus , we may conclude that @xmath117 holds for both open and closed shell fillings . on the other hand , although the result of @xmath118 apparently seems to be consistent with the spin fluctuation theory , this result may not be taken directly is since closed shell fillings selectively favors spin singlet pairing as mentioned above .",
    "we shall come back to this point later .",
    "let us now move on to the 2d system with @xmath119 .",
    "we first look into the case with open shell fillings . in fig.[fig7](a ) , we focus on the interaction vertices for triplet pairings , where we find positive interaction vertices for all three channels . however , if we compare singlet and triplet channels in fig.[fig7](b ) , @xmath120 holds for all three triplet channels .",
    "a similar result is obtained also for a @xmath121 system as seen in fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "since the pairing forms are not optimized and there is a possibility of stronger triplet pairings between more separated sites than we have considered , we can not conclude that singlet dominates over triplet .",
    "however , considering the fact that this is a result for an open shell filling , we may say that @xmath90-wave is still a strong candidate for the most dominant pairing channel even though the band filling is considerably away from half filling and @xmath62 is large .",
    "this result provides an example of singlet pairing vertex being larger than that of the triplet pairings even for an open shell filling , which conversely supports our argument in section [ 4a ] that @xmath122 in the quasi-1d system may not simply be an artifact of the open shell filling , and that @xmath4-wave may be competitive against @xmath6-wave even in the on - site hubbard model due to effects beyond rpa - type theories .      in fig.[fig9 ]",
    ", we present results for a closed shell filling .",
    "the interaction vertex for sp1 pairing becomes larger than for the open shell filling ( fig.[fig7 ] ) .",
    "the vertices for triplet pairings this time take negative values for most of the distances .",
    "this is in contrast with the result for the quasi 1d system in fig.[fig5 ] , where @xmath123 remains positive even for a closed shell filling .",
    "this comparison further enforces our argument that @xmath4-wave pairing is indeed a favorable pairing in the quasi-1d system .      to make sure that we have been on the right track , we present here qmc results for a nearly full filled ( dilute hole density ) case , where the outcome can be safely predicted .",
    "namely in this case , spin triplet pairing is expected to dominate strongly over singlet since ferromagnetic spin fluctuations arise for @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( or equivalently @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) due to the large density of states at the fermi level .",
    "this can be considered as well established because a number of approaches , including a flex study@xcite , perturbational studies@xcite , a @xmath128-matrix approximation @xcite , and a renormalization group study@xcite , reach ( at least qualitatively ) the same conclusion in this parameter regime .",
    "since pairs may be formed at large distances for dilute career density , here we calculate the pairing interaction vertex also for the singlet sp3 channel shown in the inset of fig.[fig10](b ) . for an open shell filling , the interaction vertices are in fact positive for all three triplet channels , while they are small or negative for the singlet sp1 and sp3 channels as seen in fig.[fig10](a ) .",
    "by contrast , for a closed shell filling , although the interaction vertices for tp1 and tp3 remains positive , they are much smaller than that for the singlet sp3 channel .",
    "this result contradicts with the established result , again supporting our argument that the result @xmath118 for a closed shell filling in the quasi 1d system ( fig.[fig6 ] ) may not be taken directly .      to close this section ,",
    "we present flex@xcite calculation results for the 2d on - site hubbard model with @xmath65 , @xmath64 and @xmath129 , and compare them with the qmc results given above .",
    "the formulation is as follows .",
    "first , the renormalized green s function is obtained within the flex method , which is kind of a self - consistent rpa .",
    "secondly , the pairing interaction mediated by spin fluctuations is calculated within the rpa form .",
    "finally , the flex green s function and the pairing interaction are substituted for the linearized eliashberg equation , which is solved using the power method to give the largest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenfunction ( the gap function ) .",
    "the gap functions having the largest eigenvalues are shown in fig.[fig11 ] for ( a ) the triplet and ( b ) the singlet pairing channels .",
    "the singlet gap function has a form close to @xmath89 , which corresponds to sp1 pairing in the qmc study , while the form of the triplet gap function is close to @xmath86 , which corresponds to tp2 .",
    "although the eigenvalues are small ( less than 0.3 for @xmath130 ) for both singlet and triplet , the ratio between the singlet and triplet eigenvalues turns out to be @xmath131 at @xmath132 , which is at least qualitatively consistent with the qmc results .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the competition among various pairing symmetries in the quasi-1d and the 2d on - site hubbard models by calculating the pairing interaction vertices using the ground state qmc technique . for the quasi-1d system ,",
    "@xmath4-wave pairing not only dominates over @xmath5-wave in agreement with the spin - charge fluctuation theory , but also looks competitive against @xmath6-wave pairing .",
    "@xmath4-wave being competitive against @xmath6-wave in the on - site hubbard model is rather unexpected from the spin - charge fluctuation theory because @xmath9 charge fluctuation is not enhanced in the on - site hubbard model.@xcite if @xmath4-wave is competitive against @xmath6-wave _ even _ in the absence of strong charge fluctuations , it is likely that @xmath4-wave dominates over @xmath6-wave in the actual ( tmtsf)@xmath0x , where @xmath9 cdw actually coexists with sdw.@xcite    for the 2d system , the calculation results ( at least for the open shell filling ) support presence of attractive interaction in the triplet pairing channel .",
    "however , singlet @xmath90 pairing dominates over all the triplet pairings considered in the present study _ at the band filling @xmath119 _ , which corresponds to sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , in agreement with the flex calculation .",
    "although we can not completely rule out the possibility of other ( longer ranged ) triplet pairings dominating over singlet , or a possibility of triplet dominating over singlet for larger system sizes and/or larger values of @xmath54 , the present results do suggest that it is worth considering effects beyond the single band hubbard model , including the contributions from the @xmath133 bands,@xcite in order to fully understand the occurrence of triplet superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",

    "<S> to shed light into the pairing mechanism of possible spin - triplet superconductors ( tmtsf)@xmath0x and sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , we study the competition among various spin singlet and triplet pairing channels in the hubbard model by calculating the pairing interaction vertex using the ground state quantum monte carlo technique . </S>",

    "<S> we find that triplet @xmath4-wave pairing not only dominates over triplet @xmath5-wave in agreement with the spin fluctuation theory , but also looks unexpectedly competitive against @xmath6-wave . for the 2d system , although the results suggest presence of attractive interaction in the triplet pairing channels , the @xmath6-wave pairing interaction is found to be larger than those of the triplet channels . </S>"
