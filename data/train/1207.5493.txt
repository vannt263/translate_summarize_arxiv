    "to quote from a recent monograph @xcite : _  it appears that it is much easier to find a new solution of einstein s equations than it is to understand it \" . _",
    "the present work involves the novel use of both computer algebra ( for background calculations fundamental to the approach ) and numerical routines ( for numerical integration and visualization ) with the objective being the development of a fresh view of  curvature \" , and an consequent  understanding \" ( for example , in the case of einstein s theory ) of a given spacetime . in this endeavor",
    "we are not alone . in @xcite , a visualization of spacetime curvature , restricted to a study of the projected electric and magnetic components of the weyl tensor , is being developed . in @xcite",
    "a complementary approach is also under development . here",
    ", we examine something akin to a highly complex dynamical systems approach : we look at the  flows \" associated with the gradient fields of scalar invariants of the background space .",
    "preliminary results show that these flows reveal a remarkably rich structure and fresh insights even for well known geometries .",
    "the subject of invariants , even at dimension 4 , is not closed in a mathematical sense .",
    "the approach considered here then necessarily imposes restrictions on the invariants used .",
    "we demand that any  useable \" invariant does not single out any particular observer ( which requires the definition of  observer independent \" invariants , as explained below ) .",
    "the objects fundamental to @xcite are also used here but in quite a different way : we use no projection .",
    "the approach we use does not , in a fundamental sense , use any particular theory .",
    "however , we also demand that the invariants used be connected directly to the underlying physics ( and not offer just some general geometrical interpretation ) and so we must adopt a particular theory to form this connection .",
    "we formulate the presentation given here within einstein s theory of gravity .",
    "let @xmath0 be a semi - riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the metric tensor .",
    "the simplest construction of invariants involves scalars formed from metric contractions and partial derivatives of the metric tensor to order @xmath3 ( to use the vernacular , ",
    "scalars polynomial in the riemann tensor \" ) . the number ( @xmath4 ) of algebraically ( not functionally ) independent scalars of this type ( invariants not satisfying polynomial degeneracies ( syzygies ) , explained below )",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath5 for @xmath6 and so , for example , in spacetime the number of non - differential invariants ( no derivatives of the riemann tensor ) is @xmath7 .",
    "unfortunately , this does not mean that a single set of @xmath8 invariants will cover all possibilities .",
    "the situation is rather more involved @xcite and the mathematical issue of a minimal complete set remains incompletely resolved even at @xmath9 .",
    "the problem is , perhaps , a problem of  classical difficulty \" .    whereas the mathematics of polynomial invariants remains a very active area of research ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) ,",
    "as recently pointed out by page @xcite , non - polynomial invariants can be constructed even when all polynomial invariants vanish .",
    "however , the invariants used by page , in addition to extreme computational complexity , offer no clear physical interpretation and are not considered here .",
    "when looking for exact solutions to einstein s equations , many simplifications are made , and there is a consequent reduction in @xmath4 .",
    "for example , in class @xmath10 warped product spacetimes ( which includes , for example , all spherical , plane and hyperbolic spacetimes ) it is known that @xmath11 and that @xmath12 in the ricci - flat case @xcite . however , when one attempts more realistic situations , by way of numerical relativity , no symmetries or simplifying assumptions can be made and the value of @xmath4 becomes unclear . since the approach we are considering here should ultimately be useful in these more realistic spacetimes , we need to delineate the invariants that can be used . in this section",
    "we explain why there are exactly 8 polynomial invariants that can be used ( for @xmath13 ) to construct physically clear ",
    "observer - independent \" gradient flows . going beyond these invariants",
    "explicitly introduces the four - velocity of the observer and so these invariants can not be  observer - independent \" .",
    "our notation follows that in @xcite and as explained there , the modern organization of polynomial invariants involves the construction of ricci invariants ( of which there are 4 independent invariants ) , weyl invariants ( again of which there are 4 independent invariants ) and mixed invariants which involve contractions of the ricci , weyl ( and dual ) tensors , the number of which , for completion ( that is , syzygy independence ) , is actually not known at present .",
    "let us start with the ricci invariants .",
    "einstein s equations are @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ricci tensor , @xmath16 the ricci scalar , @xmath17 the cosmological constant and @xmath18 the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we use these equations to interpret the ricci invariants .",
    "the first ricci invariant is taken to be the ricci scalar and we obtain @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the trace of @xmath18 . it is convenient , at this point , to use the trace - free ricci tensor @xmath21 so that einstein s equations now take the form @xmath22 the remaining three ricci invariants are given by @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 the physical interpretation of these invariants comes by way of ( [ traceeinstein ] ) .",
    "for example , it follows that @xmath26 with analogous higher order expressions following for @xmath27 and @xmath28 . with imposed symmetries , the number of algebraically independent ricci invariants decreases .",
    "for example , again in all class @xmath10 warped product spacetimes , and perhaps more , one can construct the syzygy @xcite @xmath29    the important points are the following : ricci invariants @xmath30 with @xmath31 are not independent for @xmath31 . the explicit forms for these syzygies up to @xmath32 are given in @xcite .",
    "] , and the ricci invariants are  observer - independent \" .",
    "to explain this last point , note that for an observer with tangent 4 - vector @xmath33 , @xmath33 does not enter the ricci invariants .",
    "whereas @xmath18 can , in some cases ( think of perfect fluids , for example ) , pick out a  preferred \" @xmath33 ( the phenomenological fluid streamlines ) , more general timelike 4 - velocities (  observers \" ) simply do not enter the ricci invariants .",
    "indeed , for a perfect fluid , for example , the ricci invariants reduce to polynomials ( up to quartics ) in the energy density and isotropic pressure .",
    "this invariance is , perhaps , made more poignant when we consider mixed invariants , as explained below .",
    "next , however , we consider weyl invariants for which  observer - independence \" is in fact manifest .",
    "there are exactly 4 independent weyl invariants ( e.g. @xcite ) and these can be defined by and @xmath34 stand for the real and imaginary parts of the complex weyl invariant @xmath35 , and similarly for @xmath36 .",
    "this notation is convenient .",
    "for example , the kerr metric has only two independent invariants because it is of petrov type d for which we always have the syzygy @xmath37 . ]",
    "@xmath38    where @xmath39 is the weyl tensor , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is dual to @xmath39 , @xmath42 and @xmath43    now define , in the usual way , the symmetric and trace - free  electric \" and  magnetic \" parts of the weyl tensor : @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath33 is an _ arbitrary _ unit timelike 4 - vector . note that due to the symmetry properties of the weyl tensor @xmath46 . it can now be shown that in general ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50    the  observer - independent \" nature of the 4 weyl invariants follows from the fact that these invariants are independent of the unit timelike 4 - vector (  observer \" ) chosen to split the weyl tensor into its electric and magnetic parts .",
    "to properly understand exactly what this means , we must move on to mixed invariants .",
    "where @xmath51 is the riemann tensor .",
    "the answer is that kretschmann is no longer considered fundamental .",
    "it is given by @xmath52 .",
    "] first , however , it is appropriate to compare the objects used in @xcite .",
    "there , projections are used so that the fundamental objects of interest are @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the projection tensor @xmath56 the physical meaning of both @xmath57 and @xmath58 is explored in considerable detail in @xcite . by @xmath59 quantities @xmath60 and @xmath61 are used .",
    "these are obtained after projection onto the spatial slices using @xmath62 . ] in very quick summary , @xmath63 produces tidal forces and @xmath64 produces differential frame dragging .",
    "it is precisely because of these physical interpretations that one introduces the splitting of the weyl tensor in the first place .",
    "but , how then do @xmath57 and @xmath65 and @xmath58 and @xmath66 differ ?",
    "a straightforward calculation gives @xmath67 and so we are considering the invariants built out of the same fundamental objects used in @xcite , but we are using these objects in quite a different way .    the next invariant in , the scheme of @xcite , is the complex mixed invariant @xmath68 .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of this invariant are given by @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "splitting the weyl tensor as before we now obtain @xcite @xmath71 and @xmath72 now , something new has entered the picture .",
    "we now have the vector @xmath73 and scalar @xmath74 to deal with .",
    "these bring our particular choice of @xmath33 into the picture and so the mixed invariant @xmath68 is not ",
    "observer - independent \" .",
    "one option is to simply avoid the splitting of the weyl tensor .",
    "this is not viable because it is precisely through this splitting that one eventually obtains the physical meaning of the weyl tensor , as explained above .",
    "another option is to allow @xmath68 and higher invariants . ] into the study of gradient flows .",
    "we do not see this as a viable option either since the whole approach used here is to reveal observer independent properties of the spacetime .",
    "the only viable option seems to be , at least for polynomial invariants , a restriction to the 4 ricci invariants and 4 weyl invariants ( at dimension @xmath9 ) as regards the construction of gradient flows .      given @xmath0 and a set of invariants @xmath75 ( we need not specify @xmath1 nor @xmath3 at this point nor even the nature of the @xmath75 ) consider the gradient flows , a negative gradient flow ,",
    "is in keeping with modern mathematical convention .",
    "the use of @xmath76 would require a more involved classification of critical points in odd dimensions ( explained below ) which we avoid . here",

    "@xcite @xmath79 note that @xmath80 can be timelike , spacelike or null . also note that even if a flow resides entirely in a subspace , calculations must be carried out in the full space since invariants of the full space are not , of course , the same as invariants of subspaces . for notational simplicity",
    "we now consider one invariant at a time and so drop @xmath81 .",
    "let us write the gradient flow for a particular invariant in the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 is any natural parametrization of the curve @xmath85 with tangent @xmath86 .",
    "it is clear that we are dealing with an autonomous dynamical system .",

    "@xmath88 it follows from ( [ gradient1 ] ) that the acceleration associated with @xmath80 is , like a killing field , not be normalized , since with ( [ acceleration ] ) , normalization would restrict @xmath80 to a geodesic flow . ]",
    "@xmath89 from ( [ gradient ] ) it follows that the associated expansion is @xmath90 borrowing the usual definition of the vorticity tensor @xmath91}$ ] , it follows immediately from ( [ gradient1 ] ) that the flows we are considering are irrotational , @xmath92    the gradient flows ( [ gradient ] ) can encounter a variety of exceptional situations , the most common of which are critical  points \" were @xmath93 .",
    "this is discussed below .",
    "perhaps the simplest exceptional situation is the development of a caustic where the expansion of the flow diverges so that , from ( [ expansion ] ) , @xmath94    in a recent influential work @xcite , it has been claimed that attempts to explain cosmic acceleration , by way of observations in locally inhomogeneous spacetimes , necessarily involves a local  weak singularity \" at the origin .",
    "this argument is based on the observation that @xmath95 necessarily diverges at the origin in these models .",
    "this point of view has been criticized @xcite . in terms of a gradient flow , as introduced here , the correct way to view this controversy is to observe that this  weak singularity \" is actually a caustic in the gradient flow of @xmath16 , as follows from ( [ expansion ] ) . since the models under consideration are simply dust , @xmath80 represents the gradient flow of the energy density .",
    "the  weak singularity \" derives from the lack of sufficiently high differentiability of the energy density at the origin .",
    "more substantial , and certainly more well known singularities , occur where any @xmath96 diverges ( so called  scalar polynomial singularities \" ) .      for any scalar field @xmath96 , the lie derivative associated with a vector field @xmath97",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath98 in certain circumstances , the scalar @xmath99 can be directly related to the invariant @xmath96 itself .",
    "for example , if the manifold admits a homothetic motion , @xmath100 , where @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) is constant , it is known that for polynomial invariants @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 is an integer characteristic of @xmath96 ( involving , for example , @xmath3 and the number of discrete contractions used to make @xmath96 ) . in the case that @xmath97 is killing ( @xmath105 ) we then have @xmath106 that is , _ polynomial gradient flows are orthogonal to killing flows _ , should they exist .",
    "itself satisfies @xmath107 , it follows that @xmath80 is concurrent @xcite , @xmath108 , and so the associated streamlines are geodesic with @xmath109 this result can be used to clarify and extend the classical notions of @xmath110 and @xmath111 regions of spacetime .",
    "this is explored in appendix a.",
    "the phase portrait associated with covariant counterpart to ( [ dynamic ] ) is dominated by critical points ( @xmath112 , where @xmath113 ) , the deep study of which leads to morse theory @xcite .",
    "gradient systems , in the large , have many diverse uses , and are the subject of much modern mathematical study . in this section ,",
    "we gather together the information required to simply _ classify _ critical points of gradient systems .",
    "it is to be noted that in many presentations , there is no mention of covariant nor contravariant components since there is in the usual context no difference .",
    "this is certainly not true here .",
    "when we talk about phase portraits these are associated with the covariant field @xmath114 .",
    "when we talk about critical points @xmath112 we mean @xmath113 .    clearly the gradient @xmath115 is a covariant vector ( and that is why we talk about phase portraits of @xmath114 ) and so the standard hessian @xmath116 is not covariant .",
    "rather , we use the covariant hessian @xmath117 which , from ( [ gradient1 ] ) , is symmetric with the trace given by ( [ expansion ] ) .",
    "( of course at critical points , the covariant hessian reduces to the ordinary hessian . )",
    "let @xmath118 designate the determinate of @xmath119 , most often called the  discriminant \" . under coordinate transformations @xmath120 , @xmath121 where @xmath122 ( we assume @xmath123 ) is the jacobian of the transformation . as a result , the sign of @xmath118 is invariant to coordinate transformations ( a condition central to what follows ) .",
    "a critical point @xmath112 is degenerate if the discriminant vanishes , @xmath124 .",
    "otherwise @xmath112 is non - degenerate , that is , a morse critical point .",

    "if they alternate in sign , @xmath96 has a local maximum at @xmath112 . otherwise , the character of @xmath96 at @xmath112 is undetermined .",
    "we are now in a position to summarize the situation @xcite : for isolated morse critical points :    * @xmath112 is an unstable node if and only if @xmath131 and @xmath96 has a local maximum at @xmath112 . *",

    "it is to be noted that gradient flows are simple flows in the sense that critical points are the only possible limit sets and that for gradient flows all critical points are hyperbolic .",
    "moreover , if the critical points are all isolated , the trajectories of the flow all terminate at critical points ( for all of these points see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "since flows can , and are in simple cases , restricted to subspaces , if @xmath124 for the full space , we classify the critical points for @xmath133 evaluated in the subspace associated with the flow . an example is given below .",
    "let us start with 2-dimensional flows and characterize the topology associated with the flow @xcite .",
    "we note the following regarding the poincar index :    * the index of a node is @xmath134 . *",
    "the index of a source or sink is @xmath134 . *",
    "the index of a hyperbolic saddle point is @xmath135 . *",
    "the index of a closed curve containing fixed points is equal to the sum of the indices of the fixed points within .",
    "the importance of calculating theses indices follows from the poincar - hopf theorem which we state here in the following simple ( and unrigorous ) form : suppose the flow is on a 2-surface @xmath136 .",
    "calculate the sum of the indices of all critical points on @xmath136 with a suitable curve @xmath137 which contains all isolated critical points .",

    "higher dimensions follow analogously ( see @xcite ) . to summarize :",
    "the detailed characteristics of the isolated critical points of a gradient flow are governed by the topology of the background space supporting the flow .",
    "in this section we examine invariants that allow the construction of newtonian analogues .",
    "consider here the simplest case , purely electric spacetimes @xmath138 ( e.g. all static spacetimes , shear - free and hypersurface orthogonal perfect fluid spacetimes _ etc . _ ) . the tidal tensor is defined by ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath139 where @xmath33 is a unit timelike 4 - vector . with the aide of ( [ electric ] )",
    "it follows that the tidal scalar @xmath111 is given by @xmath140 where @xmath141 contains terms involving @xmath142 .",

    "it is the purpose of this appendix to explore this using gradient flows .",
    "the original distinction of @xmath110 and @xmath111 regions of spacetime was restricted to spherical symmetry and given by novikov @xcite ( see also the work of ruban @xcite ) by way of a coordinate construction @xcite .",
    "this construction can be made invariant as follows : consider a spherically symmetric spacetime @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the metric of a unit 2-sphere ( @xmath241 ) and @xmath242 ( the areal radius ) where the coordinates on the lorentzian 2-space @xmath136 are labeled as @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",

    "an @xmath110 region is untrapped , a @xmath111 region trapped and the boundary marginal .",
    "whereas these distinctions are fundamental , they are restricted to strict spherical symmetry .    in order to bring gradient flows into the picture ,",
    "let us note that a stationary region of spacetime admits a timelike killing congruence .",
    "since every non - zero 4-vector orthogonal to a timelike 4-vector must be spacelike , it follows from ( [ killing ] ) that any gradient flow is necessarily spacelike in a stationary region . from ( [ norm ] )",
    "we have @xmath248 throughout an @xmath110 region , a fact that we can use to define such a region .",
    "now let us assume that there is a region in which the gradient flow is timelike so that @xmath249 . ( a killing congruence in this region , should one exist , is then necessarily spacelike . )",
    "we can use @xmath249 to define a @xmath111 region .",
    "boundary regions are then naturally defined by @xmath250 .",
    "the foregoing classification is independent of symmetries but depends on one s choice of invariant used to construct the gradient flow .",

    "it is already known @xcite , for example , that for the kerr metric , @xmath251 for the rotational parameter @xmath252 with equality holding only in the degenerate case @xmath253 .",
