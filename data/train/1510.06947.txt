    "parrondo games with one - dimensional spatial dependence were introduced by toral @xcite and extended to the two - dimensional setting by mihailovi and rajkovi @xcite .",
    "the basic game depends on two integer parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and five probability parameters , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "there are @xmath0 players arranged in an @xmath1 array with periodic boundary conditions . at each turn",
    ", one player is chosen at random to play .",
    "suppose it is the player at @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "he tosses what we call `` coin @xmath21 '' with probability @xmath22 of heads if @xmath21 is the number of his nearest neighbors ( i.e. , the players at @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ) who are winners .",
    "( a winner is a player whose last game resulted in a win . ) because of the periodic boundary conditions , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the player wins one unit with heads and loses one unit with tails .",
    "the game can be initialized arbitrarily .",
    "the game just described is known as game @xmath3 .",
    "game @xmath2 is the special case of game @xmath3 in which @xmath31 ; in particular , it is not spatially dependent .",
    "game @xmath4 is either @xmath32 a @xmath33 random mixture of game @xmath2 and game @xmath3 ( toss a coin with probability @xmath34 of heads and play game @xmath2 if heads appears , game @xmath3 if tails ) , where @xmath35 , usually denoted by @xmath36 , or @xmath37 a nonrandom pattern of games @xmath2 and @xmath3 , played repeatedly ; we restrict attention to patterns in which @xmath38 plays of game @xmath2 are followed by @xmath39 plays of game @xmath3 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are positive integers , usually denoted by @xmath40 .    of interest is @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) , the mean profit per turn at equilibrium to the set of @xmath0 players playing game @xmath3 ( or game @xmath4 ) .",
    "game @xmath2 is fair , so if @xmath7 and @xmath8 , then we say the _ parrondo effect _ is present , or that @xmath41 belongs to the _ parrondo region_. this means that the games with parameter vector @xmath42 provide an example of _ parrondo s paradox _ , in which two fair or losing games ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) combine to form a winning game ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "similarly , if @xmath43 and @xmath44 , then we say the _ anti - parrondo effect _ is present , or that @xmath42 belongs to the _ anti - parrondo region_.    we obtain a strong law of large numbers ( slln ) and a central limit theorem ( clt ) for the sequence of profits of the set of @xmath0 players playing game @xmath3 ( or playing game @xmath4 ) .",
    "the mean and variance parameters are computable for @xmath45 ( at least ) and can be simulated otherwise .",
    "the slln justifies the use of simulation to estimate the mean",
    ". the clt permits evaluation of the standard error of a simulated estimate . to get a sense of what the parrondo region looks like when @xmath46 , we fix @xmath13 and @xmath47 and graph the surfaces @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the @xmath50 unit cube .",
    "the region below the former and above the latter is a three - dimensional cross - section of the parrondo region .",
    "actually , the phrase `` below the former '' requires some clarification because , paradoxically , @xmath5 , as a function of @xmath15 for fixed @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath16 , and @xmath47 , is not necessarily increasing ( or even nondecreasing ) .",
    "that is , it is possible that increasing @xmath15 , the favorability of coin 2 , can decrease @xmath5 , the mean profit from game @xmath3 .",
    "one of the main conclusions of mihailovi and rajkovi @xcite was that `` capital evolution depends to a large degree on the lattice ( i.e. , array ) size . ''",
    "we provide evidence that this conclusion is incorrect , just as it is known to be in the case of the one - dimensional spatial model ( ref .",
    "moreover , we believe that mihailovi and rajkovi were misled by simulations whose sample size was inadequate",
    ". part of the evidence is that , under certain conditions , the means @xmath5 and @xmath6 converge as @xmath9 . by analogy with the one - dimensional case",
    ", the proof requires that a related spin system on @xmath10 be ergodic . unlike in the one - dimensional case , however , our sufficient conditions for ergodicity are rather restrictive .",
    "parrondo games were first introduced as a discretized version of the flashing brownian ratchet ( ajdari and prost @xcite ) , in which an asymmetric ratchet potential is switched on ( game @xmath3 ) and off ( game @xmath2 ) repeatedly , effecting motion ( game @xmath51 ) .",
    "the first examples were one - player games in which the asymmetric game @xmath3 was capital dependent ( harmer and abbott @xcite ) or history dependent ( parrondo , harmer , and abbott @xcite ) .",
    "multi - player parrondo games were introduced by dins and parrondo @xcite , toral @xcite , and others .",
    "of these , perhaps toral s @xcite spatially dependent games have generated the most interest .",
    "he referred to them as _ cooperative _ parrondo games but we prefer the term _ spatially dependent _ parrondo games so as to avoid conflict with the apparently unrelated field of cooperative game theory .",
    "most works on these games ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) have been concerned with the one - dimensional model , and until now only mihailovi and rajkovi @xcite have discussed the two - dimensional model .",
    "see abbott @xcite for the most recent review of parrondo s paradox .",
    "a markov chain can be defined that keeps track of the status ( loser or winner , 0 or 1 ) of each of the @xmath0 players playing game @xmath3 , where @xmath52 .",
    "its state space is the set of @xmath1 arrays of 0s and 1s , that is , the product space @xmath53 with @xmath54 states . with the help of some notation",
    ", we can specify the one - step transition matrix .",
    "let @xmath55 be the number ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 ) of winners among the four nearest neighbors of the player at @xmath18 .",
    "of course , first subscripts @xmath56 and 0 are 1 and @xmath57 ; second subscripts @xmath58 and 0 are 1 and @xmath59 .",
    "also , let @xmath60 be the element of @xmath61 equal to @xmath62 except at entry @xmath18 .",
    "the one - step transition matrix @xmath63 for this markov chain depends on @xmath11 and @xmath12 and on the five probability parameters , @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "it has the form , for each @xmath65 , @xmath66 @xmath67 and @xmath68 otherwise , where @xmath69 for @xmath70 and empty sums are 0 .",
    "we assume for now that @xmath71 for @xmath70 , in which case the markov chain is irreducible and aperiodic ; we weaken this assumption in section [ reducible ] .    for example , if @xmath46 and @xmath72 we have @xmath73 , contrary to mihailovi and rajkovi @xcite , because at most one entry of @xmath62 can change in one time step . however , @xmath74 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the description of the model suggests that its long - term behavior should be invariant under rotation and/or reflection of rows and/or columns of the @xmath1 array of players , as well as under matrix transposition if @xmath75 . in order to maximize the values of @xmath57 and @xmath59 for which exact computations are feasible",
    ", we use this idea to effectively reduce the size of the state space .",
    "the technical details are explained in lemma 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the lemma applies to our markov chain with @xmath0 playing the role of @xmath59 and @xmath76 being the subgroup of permutations of @xmath77 ( written for convenience as a matrix instead of as the @xmath0-dimensional vector @xmath78 ) generated by @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , where @xmath79 rotates the rows ( row 1 becomes row 2 , row 2 becomes row 3 , and so on , and row @xmath57 becomes row 1 ) , @xmath80 reflects the rows ( the rows are reverse ordered : row 1 and row @xmath57 are interchanged , row 2 and row @xmath83 are interchanged , and so on ) , @xmath81 rotates the columns , and @xmath82 reflects the columns . in the case of a square array (",
    "i.e. , @xmath75 ) , we can include , along with these four permutations , @xmath84 , which transposes the matrix .",
    "we must check that the condition @xmath85 ( from lemma  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath86 , is satisfied by these five permutations , and for this it is enough to verify that @xmath87 for @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and all @xmath65 , whenever @xmath90 is given by @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , or ( if @xmath75 ) @xmath84 .",
    "the practical effect of this is that we can reduce the size of the state space ( namely , @xmath54 ) to what we call its _ effective size _ , which is simply the number of equivalence classes .",
    "for example , if @xmath46 and we use @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , there are @xmath91 states and 36 equivalence classes ; see ref .",
