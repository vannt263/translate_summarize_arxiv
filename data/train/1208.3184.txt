    "the virial theorem has a wide range of applications in physics .",
    "for example , the virial theorem is a powerful tool for studying static , non - evolving ( relaxed ) systems such as stars , gas clouds , star clusters , galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "it can also be used to study large structures in the universe . not only is it applicable to nonrelativistic dynamical systems , but it can also be formulated to deal with relativistic systems which require special relativity or even general relativity for their description . of course",
    ", one can not expect to obtain a complete description of the system only by using the virial theorem .",
    "however , this theorem can provide considerable insight into the dynamical behavior of the system .",
    "for example , zwicky could discover the large mass discrepancy in the galaxy clusters only by applying the virial theorem to the coma cluster @xcite .    for a historical review of the virial theorem and also its applications in stellar astrophysics ,",
    "see @xcite .    in the context of the alternative metric theories of gravity",
    ", it is known that only the values of a set of numerical coefficients in the components of the post - newtonian metric vary from theory to theory .",
    "thus , one can encompass a large class of alternative theories by introducing arbitrary parameters in place of the numerical coefficients . in the other words ,",
    "this framework provides a model independent tool for testing the metric theories of gravity in the solar system in the small velocity and weak - field regime .",
    "although this idea dates back to eddington @xcite , but the parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) formalism was developed by nordtvedt and by will ( see @xcite for more details ) .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the ppn virial theorem .",
    "in fact , our main result is a post - newtonian virial theorem which can be used in a large class of metric theories of gravity .",
    "it should be noted that the post - newtonian virial theorem in general relativity has already been investigated by chandrasekhar @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section [ section1 ] , we derive the ppn hydrodynamics equations for metric theories of gravity . in section [ section2 ]",
    ", we derive the tensor and scalar form of the ppn virial theorem from the ppn hydrodynamics equations .",
    "einstein equivalence principle is the foundation of metric theories of gravity .",
    "thus in these theories , the world lines of test bodies are geodesics of the metric @xmath0 .",
    "mathematically , this postulate can be written as the following identity @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we assume that for a hydrodynamic system the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the rest - mass - energy density of atoms in the fluid element , @xmath5 is the pressure , @xmath6 is the specific density of internal kinetic and thermal energy in the fluid element and @xmath7 is the four velocity of the fluid element in the comoving frame ( we use the geometrized units in which the vacuum speed of light and the gravitational constant are unity i.e. @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) . in the post - newtonian limit , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 , @xmath6 and @xmath13 ( newtonian gravitational potential ) are small quantities : @xmath14 where @xmath15 stands for a term of order @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the vacuum speed of light . on the other hand",
    "the ppn metric is given by @xcite , @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath13 is the newtonian gravitational potential determined in terms of @xmath4 as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are other metric potentials ( see [ ap1 ] for the definition of these potentials ) .",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the ppn parameters .",
    "as it is known , each parameter has a special meaning and one can compare different metric theories in the post - newtonian approximation only by comparing their ppn parameters .",
    "energy - momentum tensor @xmath40 and the christoffel symbols @xmath41 can be written to the post - newtonian order by using the ppn metric .",
    "see table 4.1 of @xcite for @xmath40 in the post - newtonian limit and table 6.1 for christoffel symbols .",
    "now , by substituting the metric components ( [ ppnmetric1])-([ppnmetric3 ] ) into equation ( [ iden ] ) and by using the tables 4.1 and 6.1 of @xcite , the time component of ( [ iden ] ) takes the following form @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath11 is the velocity of a fluid element . equation ( [ continuty ] )",
    "is the continuity equation in the post - newtonian approximation .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the space component of ( [ iden ] ) takes the form @xmath44",

    "equations ( [ simspace ] ) and ( [ continuty ] ) are enough for describing a hydrodynamic system in the post - newtonian approximation .",
    "in newton s theory of gravity , the total energy of a gravitating system is conserved . furthermore ,",
    "if the gravitating system is not affected by external forces , its total linear and angular momentum are also conserved . however , in the post - newtonian approximation this is not the case for all metric theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "for example , for the conservation of the total linear momentum of system , the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath32 should be zero @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that , for theories which violate the conservation of the total linear momentum , we can not find a ppn virial theorem . because in these theories , the given gravitating system would not be stationary or periodic in time in the post - newtonian approximation and consequently it can not be considered as a virialized system .",
    "thus we shall restrict ourselves to metric theories in which five ppn parameters @xmath56 and @xmath32 are zero .",

    "so we do not present the detail of the calculations here .",

    "if the system is stationary or periodic in time then the time average over a long time interval of the symmetric part of the left - hand side of equation ( [ vir1 ] ) vanishes , i.e. @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the time average .",
    "thus the ppn generalization of the classical tensor virial theorem takes the following form @xmath73 by contracting @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the scalar ppn virial theorem is @xmath74 where @xmath75 equations ( [ tensorvir ] ) and ( [ scalarvir ] ) are our final results .",
    "it is clear from equation ( [ scalarvir ] ) that the scalar ppn virial theorem has six extra terms relative to the newtonian virial theorem .",
    "if we set @xmath76 and @xmath77 , then we obtain the post - newtonian virial theorem in general relativity . in this case , our result is identical to the result obtained by chandrasekhar @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the ppn virial theorem can be applied to investigate the post - newtonian effects of metric theories of gravity on the hydrodynamic behavior of the systems which are in the post - newtonian limit . by applying the ppn virial theorem to such cases",
    ", one can compare metric theories of gravity with general relativity . in these systems , general relativistic effects on the dynamics can not be ignored .",
    "for example , post - newtonian corrections in supermassive stars and massive white dwarfs would lead to unexpected gravitational instabilities .",
    "this fact has been shown by means of rather detailed calculations @xcite . however , by using the post - newtonian virial theorem this result could be anticipated without the need of detailed calculations @xcite .",
    "of course , as we mentioned before , by using the virial theorem one can not expect to obtain as complete a description of a hydrodynamic system as would be possible from the solution of the field equations .",
    "however , the virial theorem can provide extensive insight into the behavior of the system .",
    "in this paper , we have derived the ppn virial theorem . the virial theorem in the post - newtonian approximation",
    "has already been derived only in general relativity .",
    "we have generalized it to every metric theory of gravity .",
    "albeit , we mentioned that the ppn virial theorem can only be written for theories in which parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath32 are zero .",
    "in this appendix we simplify @xmath62 ( integral ( [ m ] ) ) as far as possible .",
