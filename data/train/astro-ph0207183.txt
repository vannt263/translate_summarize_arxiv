    "the improved spatial imaging of the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) in galaxy clusters by the _",
    "observatory has resulted in the discovery of apparent contact discontinuities , termed `` cold fronts '' , in many clusters ( markevitch 2000 ; vikhlinin , markevitch & murray 2001 ; mazzotta 2001 ; sun 2002 ) .",
    "these cold fronts occur at the boundary of a local peak in the surface brightness and are typically located within a few hundred kpc of the core of the cluster .",
    "the fronts exhibit a drop in temperature and corresponding rise in density upon entering the emission peak .",
    "the term `` cold front '' is applied to contrast the phenomenon with a shock front where the temperature would be elevated in the direction of increasing density .",
    "the origin of these cold fronts is thought to be related to cluster mergers ( markevitch 2000 ) . from an extended press ",
    "schechter treatment , fujita ( 2002 ) predict that up to one - third of present clusters will contain large subhalos . in this _ letter _",
    ", we present evidence supporting the merger origin hypothesis from a simulated cluster evolved under a ` preheated ' assumption for icm evolution ( kaiser 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ) . in this treatment , the proto - icm gas at high redshift",
    "is assumed to lie a fixed , elevated adiabat that results from heating due to star formation and/or agn activity ( bower 1997 ; cavaliere , menci & tozzi 1998 ; balogh , babul & patton 1999 ; wu , fabian & nulsen 2000 ; tozzi & norman 2001 ; voit & bryan 2001 ) .",
    "the gas subsequently evolves under gravitationally - driven shock - heating , with magnetic fields and radiative cooling ignored .    as we prepared this work for publication , nagai & kratsov ( 2002 ) , using completely independent techniques , present cold front phenomena in a pair of simulations of non - preheated cluster models .",
    "their simulations have higher spatial resolution compared to the one we present , but our lagrangian simulations have an advantage in allowing the history of gas parcels to be tracked over time .",
    "we use this ability to show that material once at the core of a merger progenitor is directly responsible for the cold emission seen at later stages of the merger .",
    "in section  [ sect : sim ] , we present the simulation and compare its cold front properties to observations . the merger history and thermodynamics responsible for the cold front",
    "are examined in section  [ ssect : phys ] .",
    "note that all scales quoted in this paper assume a hubble constant h@xmath1 .",
    "following a study of the effects of preheating on cluster scaling relations ( bialek , evrard & mohr 2001 ) , we have created a new ensemble of 68 simulated clusters that span roughly a decade in final mass .",
    "the preheating level of 105.9 kev @xmath2 , favored by the above study , was imposed upon the ensemble .",
    "all of the simulations are evolved with the lagrangian code p3msph ( evrard 1988 ) , using the multi - step procedure detailed in bialek ( 2001 ) .",
    "this ensemble has improved resolution relative to that study ; the final hydrodynamic simulation is run on an effective @xmath3 particle grid . for the cluster considered in this letter , the gas and dark matter",
    "are represented by particles of mass @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the minimum sph smoothing length is 40 kpc .",
    "twenty outputs , equally spaced in proper time , are stored for each cluster .",
    "the clusters form in a cold dark matter cosmology dominated by vacuum energy density , @xmath6cdm ( efstathiou 2002 ) .",
    "the model assumes a flat spatial geometry with the following parameters : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the hubble constant is defined as @xmath13 ; and 8 is the power spectrum normalization on @xmath14 mpc scales .    [",
    "plot : contour ]      examination of some of the mock surface brightness and temperature maps from the simulation output led to the discovery of a particular cluster with a strong cold front morphology .",
    "this cluster , examined at an output epoch @xmath15 , has a mass of @xmath16 resolved by roughly 35,000 gas and 65,000 dark matter particles , luminosity of @xmath17 and an emission weighted temperature of 2.3 kev .",
    "all values are quoted within the characteristic radius @xmath18 within which the mean interior density is 200 times the critical density at the redshift of examination .",
    "the different numbers of gas and dark matter particles reflects the loss of gas within the virial radius caused by preheating ( see fig .  13 of bialek 2001 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows surface brightness and temperature maps of the simulated cluster at @xmath15 .",
    "the morphology of the bright emission is highly distorted , with a horizontal tongue ending in an off - center surface brightness peak to the right in the figure .",
    "the peak in emission is coincident with a cold spot in the temperature map , a signature feature of observed cold fronts .",
    "following analysis of abell 2142 by markevitch ( 2000 ) , we construct radial profiles within a restricted arc oriented along the steep gradient in the surface brightness ( to the right of the cold lump , see figure  1a ) .",
    "the inner two bins are circular , centered on the surface brightness peak , and extend to 114 kpc .",
    "the outer six bins are circular arcs in a wedge with outer radius 460 kpc that projects 45 degrees to either side of a horizontal line ( parallel to the extended tongue of emission ) directed outward from the surface brightness peak .",
    "this geometry is used to bin the pixel information in the simulated maps .",
    "the resulting temperature profile is shown in figure  2a .",
    "the cool emission peak extends to approximately 230 kpc ; gas is a factor 1.5  1.9 cooler inside of the front .",
    "both the scale of the cold front and the magnitude of the temperature drop are consistent with those reported by many observers . observed temperature drops range from about a factor 1.5 seen in a1795 ( markevitch , vikhlinin & mazzotta 2001 ) to about a factor of 3 seen in ms 1455.0 + 2232 ( mazzotta 2001a ) . both a2142 ( markevitch 2000 ) and a3667 ( vikhlinin , markevitch & murray 2001 )",
    "are reported to show a factor 2 drop in temperature . regarding spatial extent ,",
    "smaller cold fronts are seen , such as ms 1455.0 + 2232 and a2142 which are both about 70 kpc from the surface brightness peak .",
    "likewise , cold fronts as large as 271 kpc ( rx j1720.1 + 2638 , mazzotta 2001b ) and 293 kpc ( a3667 ) are seen .",
    "cold fronts resulting from merger activity would have sizes determined primarily by the masses of the progenitors . from the spectrum of progenitor masses expected from hierarchical clustering ( bower 1991 ; lacey & cole 1994 ) , one would naturally expect a range of cold front scales to emerge .    for the set of simulation particles identified in the projected wedge used to examine the temperature profile , we derive densities from the normalized emission measure @xmath19 .",
    "figure  2b shows a steep drop in density between 200 and 250 kpc , the region displaying the factor two rise in temperature .",
    "the width of this feature is comparable to the size of the hydrodynamic spatial smoothing at the interior edge of the front ( as illustrated by the bar in figure  2b )",
    ". the higher resolution models of nagai & kratsov display smaller front widths , but their models do not yet resolve scales @xmath20 kpc , the width of the front feature observed by vikhlinin , markevitch & murray ( 2001 ) in a3667 .    [",
    "plot : temp ]    the thermal pressures of particles identified in the projected wedge show no strong discontinuity across the front .",
    "the velocity field exhibits some radial compression on the far side of the front , but the associated mach number is small , @xmath21 . in the next section , we show that the front is a contact discontinuity separating cold , dense material of a subgroup from the surrounding hotter , more tenuous atmosphere of the combined cluster .",
    "examination of outputs earlier than @xmath15 reveals that the cluster is in the throes of a major merger of nearly equal mass progenitors . at a redshift @xmath22 ,",
    "a friends - of - friends group finder with linking length 0.15 times the mean gas interparticle separation finds two main subgroups of the cold - front object : subgroup  1 has a total mass of @xmath23 and subgroup  2 has mass @xmath24 .",
    "the linking length identifies clumps at densities roughly 500 times the background value .    in order to examine the dynamic and thermodynamic histories of gas within the cores of these subgroups , we employ shorter linking lengths on the same @xmath22 output .",
    "values of 0.06 and 0.10 times the mean gas interparticle separation used for subgroups 1 and 2 result in core gas masses of @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "the lagrangian nature of the computation allows the core material in these subgroups to be tracked across all output epochs .    at @xmath27 ,",
    "the subgroup cores identified at @xmath28 continue to define coherent gas clumps embedded within the larger atmosphere of the merging cluster .",
    "their centroids lie at opposite ends of the tongue of emission shown in figure  1a . in figure  1b , we superpose the emission from the core gas associated with subgroup  1 . this material is responsible for the surface brightness peak and temperature dip at the location of the cold front .",
    "examination of the orbit of the subgroups shows that they orbit each other with significant angular momentum oriented nearly vertically in the plane of the images shown in figure  1 .",
    "the subgroup orbits projected along the rotational axis direction are shown in figure  3 .",
    "the location of the most bound gas particle associated with each subgroup is plotted for outputs before and after the viewing redshift @xmath27 ( indicated by solid symbols ) .",
    "the cores of the subgroups avoid direct collision and the cold front occurs at apogee of their orbit .",
    "[ plot : orbit ]    during the encounter , the gas of subgroup  1 is ablated away from the core of its local confining dark matter potential . at the viewing output , subgroup  1 s gas lags behind its collisionless dark matter component by 300 kpc ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "having been deposited into a shallower part of the potential , the overpressured gas expands adiabatically and cools .",
    "the cold nature of the core emission arises from this merger - induced adiabatic expansion .",
    "subgroup  2 , which at as early as @xmath29 is somewhat more diffuse than subgroup  1 , experiences different dynamics and does not survive the interaction as comparatively intact . at the viewing output ,",
    "its gas component has spread out over about a factor two in length and it experiences some increase in entropy due to shock heating .    the different thermodynamic behavior of the two subgroups is shown in figure  4 , where we plot logarithmic changes in density and temperature experienced by the subgroup gas over a time period of 538 myr ( the output time interval of the computation ) preceding the viewing epoch @xmath27 . just prior to the viewing epoch , particles in subgroup  1 experience a drop in density and consequentially cool , sliding down the @xmath30 adiabat shown in the figure as the straight line .",
    "the gas of subgroup  2 , which has also been left behind by its dark matter , is in a different state .",
    "the leading edge of the gas cloud is becoming more dense as it falls into its dark matter potential well and is gaining entropy as it is being mildly shock heated .",
    "this leading edge is leaving behind a diffuse tail of lagging gas , some of which is expanding and cooling adiabatically like the gas of subgroup  1 .",
    "[ plot : dphase ]    from analysis of the pair of outputs that precede the viewing epoch , we find that most of the core gas in subgroup  2 does undergo a period of adiabatic expansion similar to that of subgroup  1 . in the output",
    "preceding @xmath27 , a pair of cold spots appear in the temperature map , but their amplitudes , as well as the amplitudes of their corresponding emission peaks , are somewhat smaller than the features displayed at the viewing epoch of figure  1 .",
    "the adiabatic expansion experienced by the core of subgroup  2 also occurs during the ablation of the gas away from the center of its local gravitational potential .",
    "spatial displacement of cold front gas from the local dark matter peak is also noted in the simulations of nagai & kratsovv ( 2002 ) .",
    "adiabatic cooling of ablated dense material , coupled with compression and heating of less dense cluster gas in forward of the ablated core , may be the key ingredients involved in the creation of cold fronts by mergers .",
    "sun ( 2002 ) provide observational support for the separation of core gas from its local gravitational potential .",
    "they find a scarcity of galaxies within the observed cold front and suggest that the gas is lagging behind its associated galaxies . assuming that galaxies follow trajectories like those defined by the collisionless dark matter ,",
    "this conjecture is in agreement with the separation of the gas and dark matter seen in the simulation .",
    "we show that clusters modeled under the assumption of a preheated intracluster medium can exhibit features similar to the cold fronts observed in high resolution spectroscopic imaging of emission from clusters .",
    "we present a particular realization , displaying a temperature dip coincident with a peak in surface brightness , where the cold front is a transient feature created by ablated core material of a merging subgroup . freed from its confining local dark matter potential , adiabatic expansion cools the core while its density remains sufficiently high to create a strong feature in emission .",
    "this result supports the merger origin assumption for cold fronts and demonstrates that their observed characteristics can be reproduced by a gas dynamic treatment that ignores radiative cooling and magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "a similar conclusion using independent methods is reached by nagai & kratsov ( 2002 ) .",
    "although these studies provide an existence proof that cold fronts can result from mergers , we do not yet know if _ all _ observed cold fronts are consistent with this formation mechanism .",
    "it remains to be seen what fraction of mergers result in cold fronts and what combination of parameters  mass ratio , impact parameter , angular momentum , viewing angle  favors such an outcome .",
    "although the cold front in this study occurs when the subcluster s gas strays from its local potential minimum and expands adiabatically , we do not know if this is a necessary condition .",
    "improved understanding of cold fronts will require more extensive searches within well - defined samples of observed and simulated clusters .",
    "the relatively small numbers of observed and simulated cold fronts must be increased to enable secure statistical studies of this phenomenon in the cluster population .",
    "this simulation was produced using the computing facilities at the university of illinois s national center for supercomputing applications .",
    "this work was supported by nasa through grant nag5 - 7108 and nsf through grant ast-9803199 ."
