    "the topic of molecular magnets@xcite has emerged in the last decade as one of the major interdisciplinary fields of research in the materials science community .",
    "molecular magnets , also called `` spin clusters '' , are crystalline materials composed of magnetic centers , mostly transition - metal ions , which have strong mutual interactions within each molecule .",
    "each spin cluster in the lattice is magnetically well isolated from its neighbors due to the presence of surrounding ligands .",

    "large solid spheres represent @xmath5 ions ( outer ring ) and @xmath6 ions ( inner core ) .",
    "all @xmath7 atoms have a distorted octahedral coordination geometry.,height=245 ]    chemists and physicists have combined efforts in an increasingly coordinated approach to develop and design new magnetic molecules which can show purely quantum properties at the macroscopic level .",
    "such phenomena include very slow relaxation of the magnetization below the `` blocking '' temperature @xmath8.@xcite and quantum tunneling of the magnetization vector through an energy barrier between `` spin up '' and `` spin down '' configurations.@xcite the barrier @xmath9 is governed , to leading order , by two parameters , the ground - state spin value @xmath1 and the axial anisotropy @xmath10 of the cluster , which yield @xmath11 .",
    "the magnetic properties of the molecules are determined primarily by the exchange interactions between individual ionic spins and by their magneto - crystalline anisotropy .",
    "competition among the different exchange couplings can lead to a wealth of situations ranging from a nonmagnetic ground state ( @xmath12 ) to a variety of large - spin ground states ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "a precise knowledge of the values of the exchange interactions , and their dependence on the geometry of the molecular cluster , is therefore critical to understand the ground state and , more generally , the possibilities for new synthetic procedures providing better materials with larger energy barriers .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) is a powerful experimental probe of magnetic excitations and exchange or anisotropy parameters in molecular magnetic clusters.@xcite here we investigate the high - energy magnetic states in the best - characterized molecular magnetic system to date , @xmath14-acetate , using ins in the energy range between @xmath15 and @xmath16 mev ( 10 - 1000 k ) and with no external magnetic field .",

    "the @xmath49 and @xmath50 states are separated by an energy barrier @xmath51 of approximately 65 k ( 5.5 mev ) , which blocks the thermal relaxation in a typical magnetization relaxation experiment.@xcite surprisingly , the energy barrier @xmath9 in @xmath14-acetate remains the highest known , despite intense efforts to synthesize new magnetic clusters .",
    "higher - order ( rhombic and quartic ) terms in the anisotropy are responsible for a mixing of wave functions between pairs of states of equal @xmath52 on either side of the barrier , opening a channel for tunneling through the barrier .",

    "comparison between the experimental data and the spectra obtained from exact numerical diagonalization of a four - parameter model for the magnetic cluster allows us to assign the observed energy levels and to determine a consistent set of values for the exchange interactions in @xmath14-acetate .      the first theoretical attempts to determine the exchange interactions considered a simplified model@xcite predicated on the assumption of a single afm exchange interaction @xmath24 much larger than any of the other parameters in the system .",
    "in this situation the 4 @xmath5-@xmath6 pairs coupled by @xmath24 are locked in their @xmath67 ground state , and the size of the spin space is considerably reduced , namely to 4 spins @xmath67 and 4 spins @xmath20 . although this model provided a qualitative account of the available susceptibility data , it was far from providing a unique answer .",
    "further , from qualitative considerations of exchange interactions , and particularly the proximity of the @xmath68 @xmath23-oxo bridging angle to 90@xmath32 , even this simplifying assumption lacks justification . in short , a fully general starting point is required , and the absence of detailed information concerning the location of the magnetic excitations precludes any unambiguous determination of the exchange couplings .",

    "the observation that an @xmath1 = 10 ground state may be found only in a very small region of four - dimensional parameter space around this rather special limiting case is evidence that any significant frustrating interactions @xmath35 or @xmath244 , or deviations from @xmath296 , would in fact destroy the classical ground state .",

    "( [ eea ] ) , fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram ] ] , may also be considered as a sensitive indicator of the proximity of any similar parameter set to a ground state of a different spin @xmath297 .",
    "one consequence of this quasi - classical nature is that the magnetic excitations may be considered by conventional spin - wave theory . within this treatment ,",
    "first presented in ref .  , the cluster is considered as a ring of 4 unit cells each with 3 inequivalent sites .",
    "two of the spin - wave branches correspond to reduction of the spin component @xmath258 = 2 on the crown sites , leading to an @xmath1 = 9 state of the classical cluster , while the third corresponds to an increase of the component @xmath298 on the core sites , leading to an @xmath1 = 11 state .",
    "the 4-cell ring has 3 inequivalent @xmath118 points , where @xmath118 is an effective wave vector around the ring , whence one expects 9 levels in 3 branches : the ground state , 5 @xmath1 = 9 states , and 3 @xmath1 = 11 states .",
    "the exact energy levels for any parameter set @xmath249 may be computed by exact diagonalization , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : sw ] we show the comparison between these levels and the spin - wave approximation for the optimal mn@xmath0-acetate set ( [ eqjfit ] ) .",
    "the agreement is remarkably good for such a crude approximation to a small quantum system , again because of the special , `` classical '' set of exchange interactions found in mn@xmath0-acetate .",
    "the authors of ref .   applied their approximate treatment to the parameter set of sessoli _",
    "et al._,@xcite for which the ground state deviates strongly from the classical paradigm , and unsurprisingly a correspondence between their excited states and the exact results is difficult to establish in this case . returning to the interpretation of the ins data , the peak groups i and ii ( see table [ tabsum ] ) can be identified respectively with the first and second branches of spin - wave excitations , all of which have spin @xmath205 and provide the appropriate symmetry sectors ( @xmath118 in table [ tabspec ] ) .    the success of the spin - wave approximation in the physical parameter regime may be used for two further purposes .",
    "one is to investigate the sensitivity of the computed excitations to changes in individual interaction parameters without the need for a lengthy numerical calculation .",
    "we have performed this exercise in order to obtain the optimized parameter set ( [ eqjfit ] ) , and also to observe the relative changes of different excited levels with the parameters . here",
    "the fact that certain excitation energies change together suggests that a full , independent tuning of the levels to obtain exact agreement with the measured ins peaks may not be possible within a four - parameter exchange model , and that this would probably require the reintroduction of microscopic anisotropy terms neglected in the current analysis . in this connection",
    "we note only that single - ion anisotropy terms are expected to make the spin - wave branches less dispersive , which would improve the agreement with the ins results .",
    "the second purpose is to investigate the consequences of a breaking of fourfold cluster symmetry , if in fact one were present . in this case @xmath299 and @xmath300 , and the degeneracy of the @xmath301 states in table [ tabspec ] would be lifted . with reference to table [ tabinc ] ,",
    "these are the degenerate level pairs @xmath302 and @xmath303 . from the fact that the ins data may already be fitted by 5 gaussian peaks of rather similar widths [ @xmath173 mev ( 8.9 k ) in ( i ) and ( ii ) ] not far from the resolution limit",
    ", the spin - wave description can be used to set upper bounds on @xmath304 and @xmath305 of approximately 0.1 mev ( 1 k ) .",
    "we have performed inelastic neutron scattering measurements up to high energies to identify and characterize the magnetic excitations of mn@xmath0-acetate .",
    "we find that all of the lowest energy levels , which occur in two groups at 56.5 mev ( 6075 k ) and 810.5 mev ( 95120 k ) , appear to be @xmath205 states .",
    "there are approximately five such levels , and their intensities do not vary by more than a factor of @xmath306@xmath92 .",
    "higher levels , including the lowest @xmath58 states , are found at a significantly higher energy , namely the newly identified transition peak ( iii ) at 27 mev ( 310 k ) , which is qualitatively consistent with the location of the first magnetization step . taken together with the fact that the ground state has spin @xmath46 , the qualitative features of the measurements are already sufficient to restrict the interaction parameters of the cluster almost to a unique set .",
    "all of the available experimental information is reproduced by a parameter set with @xmath2 mev ( 65 k ) , while @xmath35 and @xmath244 are smaller than 1 mev ( 10 k ) ; refinement of the more robust quantitative features leads to the parameter set given in eq .",
    "( [ eqjfit ] ) .",
    "essential supplementary fitting information is provided by the magnetic susceptibility , which we have computed by a systematic high - temperature series expansion .",
    "a correct reproduction of the high - temperature limit sets a constraint on the four interaction parameters which determines the overall energy scale of the couplings involved . in this context",
    "we note that the leading term may be expected from the cluster geometry and dominant couplings to be determined by the combination @xmath307 , which is indeed very close to the value @xmath68 = 216 k extracted in ref .   on the assumption of one dominant interaction .",
    "in fact this constraint is difficult to reconcile with the high - field magnetization data , whose saturation field should be given by a similar combination of terms .",
    "on the basis of our measurements and calculations , the largest feature in the @xmath57 curve of refs .   and should correspond qualitatively to the saturation field .    in the consistent parameter set",
    "all four of the exchange interactions are af . from qualitative considerations based on exchange and superexchange",
    "processes these results are fully plausible , despite the proximity of certain @xmath23-oxo bridging angles to 90@xmath32 .",
    "the quantitative similarity of @xmath68 and @xmath69 in spite of the very different types of exchange pathway involved , as well as the small but positive value of @xmath35 , emphasize the difficulties inherent in performing _",
    "ab initio _ calculations sufficiently accurate to reproduce the physical properties of complex magnetic systems .",
    "even small deviations from these values are sufficient to change the spin of the ground state ( sec .",
    "[ secsusc ] ) , to bring excluded higher - spin states into the low - energy manifold , or to return a high - temperature susceptibility well outside the limits imposed by the experimental measurement .    throughout our analysis",
    "we have focused on the qualitative features which a candidate parameter set must reproduce . at the quantitative level",
    "there are two sources of error : the first is the uncertainty in the multiparameter problem of fitting the set @xmath249 to disparate ( and occasionally conflicting ) pieces of data which are themselves subject to measurement errors ; the second is the terms in the hamiltonian which we have neglected , primarily exchange asymmetries , single - ion anisotropies and higher - spin interactions .",
    "because of the first , it is manifestly not meaningful to ascribe parameter values to the second , and yet these would be required for a perfect quantitative account of an ideal magnetic excitation spectrum .",
    "thus we have restricted our considerations to robust results and qualitative fitting , adequate at the level of groups of ins peaks .",
    "these conditions are in fact sufficient to identify an unambiguous set of exchange constants .",
    "although for reasons of simplicity we have focused our presention on the precise values given in eq .",
    "( [ eqjfit ] ) , we have performed similar analyses for small modifications of this set . from the variability of exchange parameters between sets yielding a description of similar quality , we estimate an error bar of 23 k for each individual exchange parameter @xmath308 .    in conclusion ,",
    "measurements of its magnetic properties allow us to establish a definitive set of intramolecular exchange interactions for mn@xmath0-acetate .",
    "the only consistent parameter set is @xmath309 where the error bars denote the order of uncertainty for each @xmath308 .",
    "these parameters provide both a straightforward understanding of the ground state and low - energy spectrum , and a resolution of the conflicts in the existing literature .",
