    "the miniboone collaboration has recently published one pion production cross sections on mineral oil ( @xmath1 ) by @xmath2 neutrinos with energies below 2gev  @xcite .",
    "these are the first pion production cross sections to be measured since the old bubble chamber experiments carried out at argonne national laboratory ( anl )  @xcite and brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl )  @xcite .",
    "the latter were measured in deuterium where nuclear effects are small  @xcite .",
    "miniboone data poses an extra problem to theoretical models due to the expected relevance of in - medium modifications and final state interaction ( fsi ) in carbon . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the use of a formation time / zone , that reduces the impact of fsi , leads to a good agreement with the shape of different neutral current ( @xmath3 ) @xmath4 production differential cross sections .",
    "charged current ( @xmath5 ) single pion production off @xmath6 for neutrino energies up to 1gev is analyzed in ref .",
    "their results for total cross sections are below miniboone data in the high neutrino energy region ( @xmath7gev ) and the agreement improves if fsi is neglected . a different approach valid only in the low @xmath8 region",
    "is presented in ref .",
    "there the authors evaluate pion production by neutrinos in the low @xmath8 region and for neutrinos in the energy range @xmath9gev .",
    "the model is based on partial conservation of the axial current ( pcac ) hypothesis , the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis and the use of experimental cross section data at the nucleon level .",
    "the agreement found with miniboone data is good for @xmath8 values up to 0.2gev@xmath10 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors use the giessen boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( gibuu ) model finding that total cross sections measured by miniboone are higher than theoretical ones for neutrino energies above @xmath11gev . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the agreement with data for total and different flux averaged differential cross sections is better if pion fsi is neglected .",
    "however , as also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same fsi model applied to pion photoproduction is able to give a fair reproduction of experiment in that case .    in this contribution",
    "we address the problem of pion production in a nucleus starting from our pion production model at the nucleon level taken from refs .",
    "in order to better compare to miniboone data we extend the model up to 2gev neutrino energies , well above the @xmath12 resonance region for which it was originally developed . above the delta region",
    "also the @xmath13 resonance plays a role  @xcite and in the present calculation we include its contribution .",
    "we also take into account in - medium corrections to the production process .",
    "those are pauli - blocking and fermi motion and the important corrections that originate from @xmath12 resonance modification inside the nuclear medium .",
    "another issue is pion fsi for which we use a simulation program that follows the work done in ref .",
    "@xcite where a general simulation code for inclusive pion nucleus reactions was developed . in some of the channels coherent pion production is also possible and to evaluate its contribution we shall take our results in ref .",

    "our full model for one pion production on the nucleon is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagramas ] .     reaction .",
    "we have direct and crossed @xmath14 and nucleon pole terms , contact and pion pole contribution , and the pion - in - flight term  @xcite . in this case",
    "we also include direct and crossed @xmath15-pole terms.,title=\"fig:\",height=122 ]    it contains the dominant @xmath12-pole resonance term ( direct and crossed ) and background terms required by chiral symmetry . on top of that we add now the direct and crossed @xmath15-pole terms .",
    "the background terms are the leading contributions of a @xmath16 nonlinear @xmath17 model supplemented with well known form factors in a way that respects both conservation of vector current and the partial conservation of axial current hypotheses .",
    "all the details on the @xmath12 and background terms can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we followed the work in ref .",
    "@xcite and we made a combined fit of the dominant nucleon - to - delta axial form factor to anl and bnl data including both full deuteron effects and flux normalization uncertainties . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] we show the results of that fit compared to experimental data .",
    "the axial nucleon - to - delta form factors obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite are the ones we use in the present calculation .",
    "[ fig : fit ]    as for the @xmath15 resonance contribution , all details will be given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "note however that as the @xmath15 has isospin 1/2 it does not contribute in the @xmath18 channel and thus it does not affect the fit of the axial nucleon to delta form factors carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for incoherent production on a nucleus",
    "we sum the nucleon cross section over all nucleons in the nucleus . for a charged current ( @xmath5 ) process ,",
    "using the local density approximation , we arrive for initial pion production ( prior to any pion fsi ) induced by a neutrino of momentum / energy @xmath19 at @xmath20 with @xmath21 , being @xmath22 and @xmath23 the local fermi momentum and local density for nucleons of type @xmath24 . besides @xmath25 is the neutrino flux .",
    "@xmath26 is the cross section at the nucleon level modified by medium effects as discussed below .",
    "the above differential cross section is used in a simulation code to generate , at a given point @xmath27 inside the nucleus and by neutrinos of a given energy , pions with a certain energy and momentum direction .",
    "the @xmath12 properties are strongly modified in the nuclear medium  @xcite and since the direct @xmath12-pole contribution is the dominant one a more correct treatment is needed for production inside a nucleus . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we modify the @xmath12 propagator in the @xmath12-pole term as @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 the free @xmath12 width corrected by pauli blocking of the final nucleon , for which we take the expression in eq.(15 ) of ref .",

    "the terms in @xmath36 and @xmath37 are related to the two - body absorption @xmath38 and three - body absorption @xmath39 channels respectively . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath40 term gives rise to a new @xmath41 contribution inside the nuclear medium and thus it has to be taken into account beyond its role in modifying the @xmath12 propagator .",
    "this new contribution has to be added incoherently and we implement it in a approximate way by taking as amplitude square for this process the amplitude square of the direct @xmath12-pole contribution multiplied by @xmath42 . when coherent production on @xmath6 is possible we evaluate its contribution using our model in ref .  @xcite but with the nucleon - to - delta form factors as extracted in ref  @xcite . as already mentioned , to evaluate fsi effects we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and we take into account @xmath43- and @xmath44-wave pion absorption , and @xmath43-wave quasielastic scattering on a single nucleon .",
    "the @xmath43- wave interaction is mediated by the @xmath12 resonance excitation .",
    "the different contributions to the imaginary part of its self - energy account for pion two- and three - nucleon absorption and quasielastic processes .",
    "the probabilities for the different processes are evaluated in nuclear matter as a function of the density and then the local density approximation prescription is used for its use in finite nuclei . after a quasielastic event , pions change momentum and may change its electric charge . the probability for charge exchange and the final momentum distribution after a quasielastic interaction",
    "are given in ref .",
    "that information is used in the simulation program to generate the pion resulting from such a collision . besides , in between collisions we assume the pions propagate in straight lines . all the details can be found in ref .",
