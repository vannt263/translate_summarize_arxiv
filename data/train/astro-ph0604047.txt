    "a type  ii supernova ( sn  ii ) has conspicuous hydrogen lines in its optical spectrum . a type  ib supernova lacks conspicuous hydrogen lines but does have conspicuous he  i lines .",
    "a type  ic supernova has conspicuous lines of neither hydrogen nor he  i. for a review of supernova spectral classification see filippenko ( 1997 ) .",
    "supernovae of these types are thought to result from core  collapse in massive stars .",
    "a sn  ib is hydrogen  deficient in its outer layers , and displays he  i lines owing to nonthermal excitation by the decay products of radioactive @xmath1ni and @xmath1co ( lucy 1991 ) . in recent years",
    "it has becomes clear that at least some sne  ib are not completely hydrogen  free ; in fact , it is likely that most or even all sne  ib eject a small amount of hydrogen at high velocities ( deng et al .",
    "2000 ; branch et  al . 2002",
    "; elmhamdi et  al .",
    "if some of the events classified as type  ib had been observed earlier , hydrogen lines might have been conspicuous , in which case they would be classified as type  iib  the designation used for events such as sn  1993j that looked like a type  ii at early times but later looked like a type  ib ( filippenko , matheson , & ho 1993 ) .",
    "a sn  ic either is helium  deficient in its outer layers or fails to nonthermally excite its helium ( woosley & eastman 1997 ) .",
    "it has become common practice to model sne  ic in terms of core collapse in bare ( or nearly bare ) carbon  oxygen cores ( iwamoto et  al . 1994 ; foley et  al .",

    "supernova spectral features are p  cygni features characterized by line  centered emission components and blueshifted absorption components , with the absorptions frequently being more identifiable .",
    "spectral features usually are blended owing to the huge doppler broadening .",
    "nevertheless , some identifications of spectral lines are definite . for example",
    ", blends of fe  ii lines and features produced by ca  ii h&k and the ca  ii infrared triplet appear in all types of supernovae as long as the temperature is sufficiently low . however , there also are some serious identification ambiguities .",
    "the most well known involves the na  i d  line doublet at mean wavelength 5892 and the strongest optical line of he  i , 5876 , which are separated by only about 800 .",
    "if the corresponding observed feature is strong and other he  i lines are not present , the feature is produced at least mainly by na  i , while if other he  i lines are clearly present then the feature is at least partly due to he  i. but if the observed feature is not strong , it can be difficult to choose between na  i and he  i.    when sne  ic are interpreted in terms of bare carbon  oxygen cores , an absorption feature usually near 6200 , which we will refer to as 200 , is attributed to the strongest optical line of si  ii , 6355 ( the transition definitely responsible for the similarly located deep absorption in type  ia supernovae ) , perhaps blended with the strongest optical line of c  ii , 6580 , forming in higher  velocity ejecta than si  ii .",
    "thermodynamic  equilibrium ( lte ) calculations of sobolev line optical depths for a composition dominated by carbon and oxygen ( with hydrogen and helium burned to carbon and oxygen , and solar mass fractions of heavier elements ) show that within certain intervals of temperature si  ii 6355 and c  ii 6580 are expected to have significant optical depths ( hatano et  al .",
    "nevertheless , the identification of 200  is plagued by ambiguities .",
    "the strongest line of ne  i , 6402 , is about 2200  to the red of si  ii 6355 , and  6563 is only about 800  to the blue of c  ii 6580 . because these four ions , each of which could appear in supernova spectra ( although ne  i probably would require nonthermal excitation ) , have their strongest optical lines to the red , but not too far to the red , of 200 , the ambiguity is difficult to resolve when the observed feature is weak and other lines of these ions do not produce identifiable features",

    "we are primarily concerned with the possible presence of hydrogen in sne  ic .",
    "this issue ( and that of helium in sne  ic ) has been addressed in the literature before ; for summaries see filippenko ( 1997 ) ; matheson et  al .",

    "sn  1999ex was initially classified as type  ic based on a resemblance of its early spectrum to sn  1994i ( hamuy & phillips 1999 ) , but because it later developed he  i lines hamuy et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) revised the classification to intermediate type  ib / c . although the he  i lines were not as deep as in most events that have been classified as type  ib , their presence was definite , so branch ( 2002 ) referred to sn  1999ex as a `` shallow  helium '' type  ib .",
    "hamuy et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) labelled 200  as si  ii , but branch ( 2002 ) argued that the correct identification is , consistent with the presence of  in most if not all other sne  ib .",
    "recently elmhamdi et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) have reinforced the conclusion that sne  ib , including sn  1999ex and another transition type  ib / c event , sn  1996aq , eject hydrogen .",
    "( the overluminous type  ib sn  1991d ( benetti et  al .",
    "2002 ) could be an exception . )",
    "the spectra of sn  1999ex and the type  ic sn  1994i shown in figures 1 to 3 are from hamuy et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) and filippenko et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) , respectively .",
    "the horizontal scale on all figures in this paper is logarithmic wavelength , which allows the widths of doppler  broadened features to be compared on an equal basis across the whole spectrum .",
    "the spectra are `` tilted '' by multiplying by @xmath2 , with @xmath0 chosen to make the flux peaks near 4600  and 6300about equally high .",
    "the tilting makes it easier to compare spectral features . when comparing sn  1999ex and sn  1994i spectra we artificially blueshift those of sn  1999ex in order to compensate for the different photospheric velocities and roughly align the absorption features .    in figure  1",
    "a spectrum of sn  1994i obtained 2 days before the time of maximum light in the @xmath3 band ( day  @xmath4 ) is compared with a day  @xmath5 spectrum of sn  1999ex that has been blueshifted by 4000  .",
    "figure  2 is like figure  1 , but for day  + 4 spectra of sn  1994i and sn  1999ex , with the latter blueshifted by 2000  .",
    "figure  3 is for a day  + 10 spectrum of sn  1994i and a day  + 13 spectrum of sn  1999ex , with the latter blueshifted by 2000  . in all three figures",
    "the spectra are similar in many respects , although the features are more washed out in sn  1994i because of its higher photospheric velocity at each epoch ( hence the necessity to blueshift sn  1999ex to illustrate the similarities ) .",
    "otherwise the main differences are that he  i 6678 and 7065 , although weak , are clearly present in sn  1999ex ( making it a type  ib or at least a type  ib / c ) , but they are not clearly present in sn  1994i ( making it a type  ic ) .",
    "however , it is not possible on the basis of figures 1 to 3 to exclude the presence of weak he  i features in sn  1994i . given the similarities in these figures  and they are rather striking  the question becomes : are the na  i and si  ii / c  ii identifications correct for sn  1994i ?",
    "if so , then the resemblance of the sn  1999ex and sn  1994i spectra from about 5500  to 6300  is coincidental .",
    "to further investigate the possibility of hydrogen ( and he  i ) in sn  1994i we have used the parameterized resonant  scattering * synow * code ( branch et  al .",
    "2002 ) to generate synthetic spectra for comparison with spectra of sn  1999ex and sn  1994i .      in figure  4 the day  + 4 spectrum of sn  1999ex is compared with a synthetic spectrum in which 200  is produced by . in the synthetic spectrum",

    "elmhamdi et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) show that si  ii 6355 can not account for 200  of sn  1999ex on its own because even when it is undetached from the photosphere , its synthetic absorption feature is too blue .",
    "it is unlikely that 200  is due mainly to ne  i 6402 because the observed feature is strong enough that when it is fitted with ne  i 6402 other ne  i lines appear in the synthetic spectrum and the fit deteriorates .",
    "this conclusion is based on lte excitation and must be tested against detailed non - lte calculations that take nonthermal excitation into account .",

    "( 2006 ) . for this paper we began trying to fit the day  + 4 spectrum of sn  1994i by varying the input parameters that were used for the synthetic spectrum shown in figure  4 for sn  1999ex ,",
    "i.e. , we assumed the presence of hydrogen and he  i lines .",
    "figure  5 for sn  1994i is like figure  4 for sn  1999ex .",
    "the synthetic spectrum has a velocity at the photosphere of 11,000 ( compared with 8000  for sn  1999ex ) .",
    "hydrogen lines are detached from the photosphere at 15,000  where  has an optical depth of 0.4 .",
    "line optical depths decrease outward exponentially with e  folding velocity @xmath6 = 20,000  to an imposed maximum velocity of 22,000 .",
    "this hydrogen optical  depth profile is quite similar to that used for sn  1999ex in figure  4 , and in figure  5 200  is fit nicely .",
    "the 5700    absorption also is fit nicely by he  i 5876 . in the synthetic spectrum he  i 6678 and 7065 are weak and rather washed out owing to the high photospheric velocity , but they do more good than harm and their presence in the observed spectrum can not be excluded .",
    "( however , regarding the strong observed absorption near one micron , the situation remains as illustrated and discussed in millard et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; the synthetic he  i 10830 absorption is too weak and narrow to account entirely for the observed absorption . )",
    "reference  line optical depths and @xmath6 values for figure  5 are given in table  1 .",
    "the synthetic spectrum in figure  6 is like that of figure  5 except that it includes si  ii lines instead of hydrogen lines .",
    "the figure illustrates that in sn  1994i , as well as in sn  1999ex , si  ii 6355 is too blue to account for 200  on its own ( flux differences between observed and  spectra are to be expected , but differences in wavelengths of absorption features are regarded as serious disrepancies ) , although it is possible to obtain a fit by invoking detached high ",
    "velocity c  ii .",
    "because 200  is less deep in sn  1994i than in sn  1999ex , and the sn  1994i features are more smeared out by the higher photospheric velocity , it also is difficult to exclude ne  i 6402 in sn  1994i .",
    "we have discussed the possibility of  in absorption , in the spectrum of the type  ic sn  1994i . as shown in figure  7 ,",
    "this is an issue for sne  ic in general ; the spectra within the wavelength interval emphasized in this paper have strong similarities .",
    "other evidence for hydrogen in sne  ic was emphasized by filippenko ( 1988 ; 1992 ) : the apparent presence of broad emission in near  maximum  light spectra .",
    "this feature can be seen in the day  @xmath4 spectrum of sn  1994i in figure  1 ( beneath a narrow  emission due to an h  ii region ) . in order to produce a peaked rather than a flat  emission component the hydrogen would have to be present down to the photosphere , rather than being confined to a detached high  velocity shell such as we have invoked for the absorption component . in this regard",
    "it is interesting to note that in figures  1 to 3 the red edges of the putative  and he  i 5876 absorptions in sn  1994i are less sharp than in sn  1999ex ; a detached shell produces sharp red edges .",
    "a continuous  optical  depth distribution that peaks at 15,000  but extends down to the photosphere might suffice to produce a peaked  emission .",
    "this can only be tested by non - lte calculations because the resonance ",
    "scattering approximation on which  is based is known to be a poor approximation for  in sne  ii .",
    "it is not clear that a large hydrogen mass would be required because the appearance of hydrogen and he  i lines depends on the radial optical  depth profiles ( branch et  al .",
    "2002 ) and on the distribution of @xmath1ni ( woosley & eastman 1997 ) .    at present",
    "it is difficult to establish the presence or absence of hydrogen in sn  1994i  like sne  ic , but the issue should be considered further .",
    "a large  scale comparative study of observed spectra , like that of elmhamdi et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) but including sne  ic as well as sne  ib , probably would yield clues .",
    "in addition , detailed non - lte spectrum calculations for a grid of explosion models are needed .",
    "such calculations , even based on parameterized explosion models rather than full hydrodynamical calculations , could probe several issues : e.g. , is ne  i 6402 really a candidate to produce 200 , and under what circumstances can peaked  emission be produced ? in the only full non - lte calculations for sne  ic published so far ( baron et  al .",
    "1999 ) , synthetic spectra for models containing no hydrogen did not provide good fits to 200  in sn  1994i .",
    "an interesting recent case is that of sn  2005bf ( anupama et  al .",
    "2005 ; tominaga et  al . 2005 ; folatelli et  al .",
    "2006 ) , which like sn  1999ex was initially classifed as type  ic but later developed definite he  i lines , making it either type  ib or type  ib / c ( or type  icb ? ) . in each of these three papers",
    "the 6200    absorption was attributed to .",
    "strong support for the identification was provided by the presence in early spectra of ca  ii and fe  ii at the same high velocity ( 15,000 ) as the  absorption ( folatelli et  al .",
    "the very long rise time to maximum light of 40  days indicates that the progenitor was massive .",
    "in addition , sn  2005bf showed evidence for high  velocity polar ejection , reminiscent of sn  1998bw  like explosions of massive stars , some of which produce gamma  ray  bursts ( grbs ) . in view of the high ejected mass and the polar ejection , folatelli et  al . suggested that sn  2005bf may have been a transition event between ordinary sne  ib / c and hypernovae . therefore if sn  2005bf ejected hydrogen we should consider the possibility that sn  1998bw  like sne  ic also do .    in sn  1998bw  like spectra 700  and 200  are assumed to be na  i and si  ii , respectively . these identifications initially were adopted ( iwamoto et  al .",
    "1998 ; branch 2001 ) partly because they were assumed to be correct for sn  1994i , and sn  1998bw  like spectra were and still are regarded to be doppler  broadened versions of sn  1994i  like spectra , and partly because monte carlo spectrum calculations for bare carbon  oxygen cores do provide reasonable fits to sn  1998bw  like spectra ( e.g. , mazzali , iwamoto , & nomoto 2000 , mazzali et  al .",
    "2002 ) with si  ii and/or c  ii producing 200 .",
    "thus , even if 200  in sn  1994i  like sne  ic is produced by , it may still turn out to be produced by si  ii in sn  1998bw  likes .",
    "nevertheless , the possibility that even in sn  1998bw  likes the correct identification is  rather than si  ii ( and perhaps he  i rather than na  i ) should be considered .",
    "full non  lte spectrum caclulations for comparison with sn  1998bw  like spectra are in their initial stages ( e.  baron & m.  troxel , in preparation )",
    ".      ideas concerning the progenitors of sne  ib and sn  1994i  like sne  ic have been reviewed by podsiadlowski ( 1996 ) , who concluded that most of the progenitors are stars of main  sequence masses @xmath720 solar masses that lose their envelopes by means of binary interactions . in standard binary evolutionary scenarios ,",
    "if all or even just a substantial fraction the helium envelope must be lost , all of the hydrogen is lost .",

    "( 1994 ) favored a scenario involving two common ",
    "envelope episodes that results in a carbon  oxygen core containing little or no helium and no hydrogen",
    ". however , as emphasized by podsiadlowski , there are many unresolved questions in binary stellar evolution .",
    "if sn  1994i  like sne  ic eject hydrogen ( and therefore also , of course , helium ) , some modification of the standard evolutionary scenarios , perhaps involving substantial mixing of hydrogen prior to and/or during the explosion , will be needed .",
    "sn  1998bw  like sne  ic , including those that produce grbs , are usually regarded to come from stars of sufficiently high main  sequence mass that they can lose their envelopes by means of single  star winds .",
    "those that produce grbs may have to be in binaries in order to have sufficient angular momentum at the time of core ",

    "the uncertainities involved in the evolutionary scenarios for sn  1998bw  likes are even greater than for sn  1994i  likes , and if sn  1998bw  likes eject hydrogen , current scenarios will require revision .",
    "particularly interesting in this regard are recent results on chemically homogeneous evolution of rapidly rotating massive stars ( yoon & langer 2005 ; woosley & heger 2006 ) . some of these grb  candidate models contain hydrogen at the time of core collapse .",
