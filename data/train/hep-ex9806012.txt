    "in addition , these branching fractions are used to determine the total number of @xmath3 events in a wide variety of measurements that take advantage of the clean experimental @xmath15 @xmath16 or @xmath17 signature .",
    "the first reported measurement of the leptonic @xmath3 branching fractions has a precision of about 15% and is based on an energy scan across the resonance performed by the mark - i group  @xcite .",
    "a subsequent measurement by the mark - iii group  @xcite is based on a comparison of the rates for @xmath0 , @xmath18 and @xmath2 anything and is , thus , independent of the luminosity determination .",
    "the mark - iii measurement has a precision of 4% and is about one ( mark i ) standard deviation below the mark - i result .",
