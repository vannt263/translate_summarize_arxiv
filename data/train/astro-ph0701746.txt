    "we still lack , however , an understanding of the astrophysical processes which produce massive galaxies with the properties that these show in the local universe : gas cooling , star formation , stellar and agn feedback , are all poorly -if at all- understood processes , which are currently parametrized with _ ad hoc _ recipes in galaxy formation models .",

    "this degeneracy can in principle be removed by observations of the evolution of the number density of ellipticals as a function of redshift ; however , small statistics , cosmic variance and details in the different analysis of the high@xmath4 samples have generated a debate as to whether massive ellipticals are already fully assembled by @xmath19  a fact which , if true , would require considerable rethinking of the currently favored galaxy formation models ( see , e.g. , bell et al .",

    "some studies have suggested that the majority of the most massive ( @xmath20 ) early - type galaxies ( etgs ) is assembled over the last few gyr from the dissipationless ( `` dry '' ) mergers of less massive etgs @xcite .",

    "this result roughly agrees with the analysis of lin and collaborators who , from the count of close pairs in the deep2 sample , conclude that only @xmath31 of present - day @xmath32 galaxies have undergone a major merger over the same period . supporting evidence against a large contribution of dry mergers to",

    "estimate implies a dry - merging rate much lower than the rate at which etg - hosting dark matter halos merge with one another @xcite , possibly highlighting a potential problem with cdm simulations , or in the way these simulations are related to the observed galaxy populations .    in any event , there are clearly major discrepancies among current attempts at measuring the dry merger rate , which in part are the result of the uncertainty affecting the time it will take to a given galaxy pair to merge , or to some tidal debris to disappear , and in part to small - number statistics . in this paper",
    "we follow a different approach in order to set limits to the role played by dry mergers in establishing the population of massive etgs in the local universe . here",
    "we map the evolution with redshift up to @xmath11 of the number density of massive etgs .",
    "since the bulk of stars in these galaxies formed at much higher redshifts ( see the extensive literature quoted in renzini 2006 ) , an increase in the number density of massive etgs since @xmath16 should be ascribed to dry mergers , alternatively , a lack of evidence for such an increase would allow us to set limits on the dry merging rate .",

    "depending on the relative timing and importance of in - situ star formation versus stellar mergers , @xmath19 progenitors of ellipticals may thus appear as already morphologically - relaxed systems or possibly show passively - evolving stellar populations with irregular morphologies due to recent mergers .",
    "therefore , to identify _ all _ plausible high@xmath4 progenitors of local etgs we consider the sample created by the union of the morphologically and photometrically selected galaxies .",

    "the number density of the brightest and thus most massive photometrically - selected etgs does not evolve from redshift @xmath16 to redshift @xmath9 . at fainter magnitudes",
    ", however , the number density of photometrically - selected early - type galaxies shows an increase of a factor up to three from @xmath15 to @xmath9 .",
    "we stress that the sample of bright photometrically - selected etgs is not contaminated by dusty disks .",
    "indeed , we found that the fraction of type  1@xmath3022.0 in the photometrically - selected sample of etgs at redshift @xmath16 is @xmath303% for galaxies brighter than @xmath304 .",
    "broadly speaking , a similar result is obtained also for the morphologically - selected and combined samples of early  type galaxies .",
    "however , adopting a similar evolution as above , the number density of the brightest , @xmath305 morphologically - selected type  @xmath146 etgs at @xmath15 in the cosmos field would slightly exceed the number density of the brightened sdss sample .",
    "this suggests a faster luminosity evolution for the morphologically - selected sample of etgs , which is consistent with the latter containing a fraction of galaxies with colors bluer than those predicted for a passively evolving stellar population ( see section  [ sec : colors ] ) . these blue colors might arise from a substantial fraction of mass in intermediate - age stars",
    "however , a recent second bursts of star formation , producing only a few percent of the stellar mass , would also make significantly bluer the colors of the stellar population and increase the @xmath39band luminosity of the galaxies .    for example , adding a 1 to 5% stellar mass in a second burst of star formation to an underlying old , single - burst population with formation redshift @xmath128 is sufficient to explain the @xmath114 colors of even the bluest morphologically - selected etgs at all redshifts under study .",
    "this suggests that the bulk of the stellar mass in _ all _ morphologically - selected high-@xmath43 etgs is already formed by @xmath19 .",
    "this is consistent with the other studies that we have already mentioned , which find that @xmath306 galaxies with @xmath307 have an integrated specific star formation rate less than the global value .",
    "these studies conclude that the bulk of star formation in massive galaxies occurs at early cosmic epochs and is largely complete by @xmath308 , and that further mass assembly in these galaxies takes place with low specific star formation rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , similar to the case of the photometrically - selected progenitors of etgs , also the morphologically - selected sample and the combined sample of early  type galaxy progenitors show a remarkable lack of evolution of the very bright - end of their lf . fainter early  type galaxies are instead again about a factor @xmath14 less numerous than at @xmath9 .",
    "more quantitatively , we compute the total density of etgs brighter than @xmath309 in both the combined sample of cosmos and sdss etgs .",
    "we indicate these two densities with @xmath310 and @xmath311 , respectively .",
    "the adopted value of @xmath312 is the one derived from the schechter fit to the @xmath16 lf of the combined sample ( see table  [ tbl : schfit ] ) . in order to compute @xmath311",
    ", we integrate the sdss local lf brightened by 0.95 magnitudes .",
    "consistent with the qualitative analysis presented above , we find that    @xmath313    the density of @xmath314 etgs remains constant , within the poissonian errors , since @xmath16 to today .",
    "this conclusion might in principle depend on the assumed amount of luminosity evolution ( i.e. , the sfh of the etg population ) , on the cosmic variance , and on the effect of the photometric redshift uncertainties on the lfs as we discuss in appendix  [ app : phzerr ] and section  [ sec : lf ] , poissonian errors at such bright magnitudes are , however , larger than the uncertainties on the lf induced by the errors on the photometric redshifts",
    ". errors due to the photo@xmath4 can thus be neglected .",
    "the effect of cosmic variance on @xmath310 can be quantified using the prescription of @xcite .",
    "we estimate that , for the given density and cosmos volume , this uncertainty contributes at most @xmath2525% to the error on @xmath310 .",
    "we obtain a similar result by calculating the variance of the total number of @xmath305 , i.e. @xmath315 , galaxies in the 24 mock galaxy catalogs generated by @xcite for the cosmos survey using the millennium run numerical simulations . the sdss density , @xmath311 , is not affected by cosmic variance , since the 1800 sdss galaxies were chosen randomly in a local volume larger than @xmath316 mpc@xmath292 , and the derived sdss lf closely matches the @xcite lf derived from the entire sdss galaxy catalog ( see further discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "what causes the largest uncertainty in @xmath311 is the assumed luminosity evolution for the etg stellar population . in the previous analysis",
    "we have used the evolution of a single stellar population formed at redshift @xmath128 , justified by the fact that this sfh is consistent with the observed evolution of the red - sequence zero point ( see section  [ sec : zp ] ) .",
    "however , we can estimate the changes induced on @xmath311 due to a reasonable range of sfhs , and use them as more realistic estimates of the errors on @xmath311 .",
    "although the range of observed @xmath317 reported in the literature is broad ( see , e.g. , table  2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , a recent study by @xcite shows that stars in massive etgs ( @xmath142 ) , both in clusters and in the field , have a mean luminosity - weighted formation redshift of @xmath143 . for such massive galaxies , @xcite",
    "show that the star - formation time scale is less than @xmath318 gyr , which therefore makes our @xmath144 a reasonable approximation for the measured value .",
    "this formation timescale , together with the error on @xmath144 presented by @xcite , can be used to derive the uncertainty on @xmath311 due to varying the luminosity evolution of the etgs .",
    "we find that an uncertainty in formation redshift of @xmath319 corresponds , roughly , to a @xmath320 at a redshift @xmath16 .",
    "it follows that the total density of @xmath321 etgs in the combined sample is @xmath322 mpc@xmath155 .",
    "it is clear , then , that the largest source of uncertainty on @xmath311 is indeed due to the assumed sfh .",
    "considering together the effects of cosmic variance and varying the sfhs , the ratio between the observed and predicted density of massive etgs at redshift @xmath16 is therefore @xmath323 .",
    "this shows that bright ( @xmath324 ) etgs are already in place at @xmath16 , and that the maximum evolution in the number of bright etgs allowed from @xmath16 to @xmath9 is at most of @xmath13% .",
    "in contrast , there is indeed a dearth of lower - luminosity etgs , at @xmath11 compared with the local universe .",
    "this deficiency of intermediate - to - faint etgs is not an effect of incompleteness , since ( @xmath153 ) both in the morphologically- and photometrically - selected samples , the deficit of early  type galaxies is visible at magnitudes @xmath325 , i.e. , well above our magnitude limit ( @xmath326 at @xmath16 ) ; ( @xmath327 ) the central wavelength of f814w filter matches the rest - frame @xmath39band at @xmath30 ; this implies that , down to the faintest magnitude bin considered , there are no color - dependent selection effects in the redshift range @xmath328 ; ( @xmath329 ) the zest classification recovers the morphological class for @xmath330% of the galaxies down to @xmath331 ( paper  i ) ; furthermore , possible systematics in the morphological classification are identical for the cosmos and for the local sdss sample used to normalize our results .",
    "arguments for an apparent anti - hierarchical mass assembly of etgs were recently presented based on the redshift evolution of the mass function @xcite and of the luminosity function ( cimatti , daddi & renzini 2006 , brown et al .",
    "2007 , wake et al . 2006 ) . furthermore",
    ", enough star - formation is observed in massive galaxies at higher redshifts to account for all stars that we observe already assembled in massive galaxies by @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "our morphological selection of etgs adds to this picture the key information that not only the full mass assembly of the most massive etgs was completed at an earlier cosmic time compared to the less massive galaxies , but also that the majority of these systems achieved dynamical relaxation by @xmath19 .",
    "a relatively large fraction of the less massive early - type galaxies has either not yet achieved relaxation at the redshift ( epoch ) at which they are observed , or not completed its star - formation .",
    "we highlight our three main results : @xmath332 the shapes of the lfs of morphological , photometrical and combined samples of etg progenitors at all redshifts are remarkably similar ; @xmath333 the vast majority of photometrically - selected massive etgs is already dynamically - relaxed and has thus the morphology of an early - type galaxy at redshifts @xmath19 ; and @xmath334 there is a a deficiency of approximately @xmath335 etgs as opposed to remarkable constancy of the bright end ( @xmath314 ) of the lfs of morphologically- and photometrically - defined etgs .",
    "these findings support a scenario in which the brightest , most massive early type galaxies are already fully assembled @xmath336 gyrs ago , while fainter , less massive early  type galaxies keep forming their stars and assembling their mass from @xmath16 to the present .",
    "this trend in the observed evolution of the lfs of early - type galaxies , together with the observed constancy with redshift of the lfs shapes , argues against a significant contribution of dry mergers in the build up of the @xmath9 massive etg population .",
    "furthermore , we suggest that the @xmath9 lower luminosity early - type galaxies are the end product of the conversion of blue irregular and disk galaxies into ` red' , early - type galaxies . this explanation is also supported by the observed increase of about a factor of three in the number density of irregular galaxies from the local universe to @xmath16 ( paper  i ) .",
