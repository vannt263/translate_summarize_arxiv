    "planck scale phenomena are expected to be described by fundamentally new physics other than the traditional one describing our relatively low - energy world . due to the high energy involved , a long sought quantum theory of gravity may play fundamental role , along with the other known interactions , in describing this extreme environment , and spacetime local structure",
    "may reveal itself as behaving very differently from minkowskian one . as the universe expanded and cooled to its present state",
    ", high energy relic effects could reveal themselves as small deviations from known well established physics and , of these , lorentz symmetry violation is a possibility that has been intensively studied in the past decades , leading to a vast spectrum of new theoretical constructions @xcite .    a research program for lorentz symmetry violations , initiated by colladay and kosteleck @xcite , deals with a ( quantum field theory based ) standard model extension ( sme ) allowing for lorentz and @xmath0 violations coming from all possible observer lorentz scalars formed by couplings between standard model fields and coefficients with lorentz indices , playing the role of constant background fields .",
    "such a construction could arise , for instance , as an effective low - energy limit of a high - energy lorentz invariant theory which undergoes spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking .",
    "the minimal extension exhibits the standard model su(3)@xmath1su(2)@xmath1u(1 ) gauge structure and is power - counting renormalizable , yielding a lagrangian with a finite number of lorentz noninvariant terms of mass dimension equal or less than four composed with standard model fields  causality , unitarity , and other issues may be further analysed @xcite .",
    "several interesting effects coming from lorentz violation have been studied .",
    "some of these deals with spacetime - varying couplings @xcite , alternative models for neutrino oscillations @xcite , black hole thermodynamics @xcite , lorentz violation as an origin for gravitation @xcite , spontaneous breaking of lorentz invariance leading to a nonlinear electrodynamics @xcite , among others @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "high precision measurements have already placed stringent upper bounds on coefficients for lorentz violation from various sectors @xcite , but with no claims for discovery of lorentz violation so far . in a more formal aspect ,",
    "consistency under quantum corrections of sectors of the sme has also been studied , for instance in refs .",
    "@xcite , and is the topic of the present work .    here , we give a natural continuation of a previous work @xcite , where we investigated the renormalizability to all orders of the lorentz noninvariant ( minimal ) extension of the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in the algebraic approach @xcite .",
    "there , we identified new anomaly structures besides the usual adler - bardeen - bell - jackiw ( abbj ) @xcite one .",

    "this paper is presented as follows . in section [ framework ]",
    ", we introduce the qed extension allowing for lorentz violation along with considerations for one - loop evaluations . in section [ section : anomalies ] we evaluate the one - loop three - photon vertex and verify the absence of ( vectorial ) gauge anomaly . contributions for this process from multiloop and nonlinearity in lorentz - violating coefficients",
    "are also briefly discussed .",
    "our results are summarized in section [ section : conclusions ] and some perspectives are given .",

    "the trace part of @xmath9 is lorentz invariant and only yields a redefinition of the fermion fields , so we take it to be zero ; @xmath10 and the first two indices of @xmath11 are antisymmetric ; @xmath5 have the symmetries of the riemann tensor and , analogous to @xmath9 , can be taken double traceless ; at last , @xmath12 can be eliminated by a chiral rotation in the absence of chiral anomalies . along with action ( [ qedex ] ) , we may add @xmath13,\\ ] ] _ i.e. _ , a gauge - fixing term and an infrared ( ir ) regulator , introduced in order to avoid infrared singularities by means of a mass term for the photon field , respectively .",
    "we define a ( local ) gauge ward operator , @xmath14 to functionally implement gauge transformations .",
    "this is a symmetry of the action ( [ qedex ] ) , @xmath15 , and the addition of the gauge - fixing and ir regulator ( [ gf - ir ] ) linearly breaks it , @xmath16 but due to this linearity , the right - hand side of this expression receives no quantum corrections during renormalization procedure , remaining a classical breaking .",
    "precision experiments place very stringent upper bounds on coefficients for lorentz violation from various sectors of the sme @xcite , so we define as concordant frames those which move nonrelativistically with respect to the earth , where these coefficients are measured to be very small .",
    "we restrict our analyses to these frames to avoid spurious enlargements of the coefficients and construct a meaningful perturbative expansion .",
    "calculations will be done to first order in loop - expansion and only contributions linear in lorentz - violating coefficients may be considered  nonlinear contributions may be of the same order of magnitude as those from diagrams with higher number of loops , which we do not consider .",
    "an important consequence of the smallness of possible lorentz noninvariance effects is that we may regard the lorentz - violating pieces of ( [ qedex ] ) as interaction vertice .",

    "these are the vertex correction and electron self - energy , photon self - energy , and three - photon vertex diagrams .",
    "the only one remaining to be explicitly studied in the literature is the three - photon vertex , which we deal with and verify it to be anomaly - free .      from the vertex functional @xmath22 , defined as the generating functional of 1-particle irreducible graphs",

    "the right - hand side of this identity is constrained to be zero , for instance , due to discrete @xmath27- and @xmath28-symmetries respected by @xmath29 and lorentz invariance , both restricting all appearing terms to have the form of a gauge variation of field polynomials , which are then further reabsorbed by @xmath30 , and the polynomials interpreted as noninvariant counterterms coming from noninvariant regularization schemes . ] .",
    "it can be easily verified that evaluation of coefficients @xmath31 to @xmath32 hinges in the computation of the vertex correction @xmath33 and electron self - energy diagrams @xmath34 , @xmath35 and that coefficient @xmath36 is related to the photon self - energy @xmath37 , @xmath38 these six coefficients vanish to one - loop order @xcite .",

    "before , it is important to notice that in ( [ ward - anomalies ] ) , due to the contraction with @xmath44 , only pieces of this coefficient respecting @xmath45 can contribute to the anomaly .",
    "therefore , any piece without this index symmetries appearing after the evaluation of the left - hand side of ( [ triang - first - eq ] ) will not represent an anomaly : it represents noninvariant counterterms that can be reabsorbed by a redefinition of the vertex functional @xmath22 at that loop order and are further cancelled , order by order in perturbation theory , leaving no physically measurable effect @xcite .",

    "comparison with our case reveals this is analogous to considering ( [ qedex ] ) with only lorentz - violating coefficient the isotropic part ( _ i.e. _ , the trace part ) of @xmath65 , and our results agree with @xcite .",
    "the nonisotropic contribution from @xmath65 leads to an anomaly similiar to the abbj but with lorentz - violating anomaly coefficients , as can be seen in ( [ div - arb - shift - redefinition ] ) , and we checked it vanishes to one - loop order .",
    "it would be interesting to study how the adler - bardeen theorem generalizes to this case , but this is beyond the scope of this work . as suggested before , there is a good indication the anomaly indeed vanishes to all orders .",
    "in this work we dealt with the search for possible gauge anomalies in a lorentz - violating qed extension . continuing the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite , we made further progress by explicitly verifying the gauge invariance of the three - photon vertex to one - loop order and by presenting a conjecture stating the absence of gauge anomalies coming from this process to all orders , relying on the argument that generalized furry s theorem may prevent the anomaly coefficient to receive nonvanishing contributions from coefficients for lorentz violation .",
    "explicit verifications , or a deeper analysis , of this conjecture would be of great interest along with an all - orders proof of the vanishing of the others anomaly coefficients , paving the way for a verification of renormalizability of the model to all orders in perturbation theory .",
