    "the research of spin effects in collisions of high energy particles gives important information about their fundamental properties : the quark - gluon interaction , particle wave function , the chiral symmetry violation mechanism , etc ( yndurain 1993 ) . in the local quantum field theory",
    "there are two fundamental principles : unitarity and analyticity .",
    "it is known that unitarity links the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude with the total cross section for colliding particles . in general case",
    "the total cross section depends on a spin orientation and can be measured .",
    "the dispersion relations between real and imaginary parts of the forward scattering amplitude can be obtained from analyticity . by measuring imaginary and real parts of a zero angle scattering amplitude in a wide energy range",
    "we get a possibility to check up unitarity and analicity principles . as",
    "the direct measurements of the real part of the forward scattering amplitude in ordinary scattering experiments are practically impossible , it is necessary to measure the differential cross section and other observables for small - angle range of the coulomb - nuclear interference with subsequent extrapolation of data to the zero angle ( akchurin 1993 ) .",
    "there is , however , a possibility of the direct measurement of the real part of the forward scattering amplitude ( baryshevsky 1992 , 1993 ) .",
    "it was shown that under penetration of a particle with @xmath1 spin through the medium two effects : spin rotation and oscillation appear .",
    "the magnitude of these effects is determined by the real part of the spin - dependent forward scattering amplitude .",
    "the unic peculiarity of the spin oscillation phenomenon is that the spin oscillation effect does not decrease with energy increasing , but even gains ( baryshevsky 1993 ) .",
    "this phenomenon was analyzed for a deuteron ( baryshevsky 1993 ) .",
    "it was shown , that the spin dependent part of the forward scattering amplitude measured with the help of spin oscillation phenomenon is determined only by effects of nucleon rescattering and gives the information about the nucleon interaction at small distances .    in the present work we consider the phenomena of oscillation and rotation of @xmath0-hyperon spin .",
    "for description of this effect we use the glauber eikonal approximation ( czyz and maximon 1969 ) .",
    "it explore the idea that the matter densities of the colliding particles determine the small angle scattering cross section and follows from the geometry and probability calculus .",
    "it turns out that the effects of the spin rotation , oscillation and dichroism is sensitive to the hadron inner structure i.e. allow to check the hypotheses of the constituent quarks .",
    "picture of hadrons as being made of spatially separated constituent quarks is not new .",
    "it was considered on phenomenological grounds many times ( anisovich 1985 ) since the pioneer works of gell - mann 1964 .",
    "after some period of misunderstanding it was clearly stated by gell - mann that `` constituent '' and `` current '' quarks are completely different objects .",
    "the constituent quarks or `` valons '' ( hwa 1980 ) appear as quasiparticles , that is as current quarks and surrounding them clouds of gluons and quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "spin - dependent part of the zero angle elastic scattering amplitude of @xmath0-hyperon at an unpolarized proton measured with the help of spin oscillation and dichroism is determined by the shadowing effects which strongly depends on the structure of hadrons .",
    "in accordance with baryshevsky 1992,1993 the well - known formula ( lax 1951 ) @xmath3 for the refraction index of a particle inside the matter can be applied to the non - zero spin particles . here",
    "@xmath4 is the density of scatterers in matter ( the number of scatterers in @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 is the wave number of an incident particle .",
    "@xmath7 is the zero - angle elastic scattering amplitude , which is an operator in spin space of the incident particle .",
    "the dependence of the amplitude @xmath7 on the orientation of colliding particle spins gives rise to quasioptic effects ( spin rotation , spin oscillation and dichroism ) under the passage of a particle through the medium ( baryshevsky 1992,1993 )",
    ".    for particles with spins @xmath1 ( baryshevsky 1992,1993 ) the rotation of a spin arises even in passing inside unpolarized targets .",
    "consider the propagation of @xmath0-hyperon through the unpolarized medium in detail .",
    "let the spin state of a particle being incident on a target is characterized by an initial spin wave function @xmath8 .",
    "then the spin wave function of the particle in the target can be written as : @xmath9 if the target is unpolarized , the scattering amplitude at the zero angle is determined by hyperon spin properties only : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 correspond to zero angle scattering amplitudes for the @xmath13 hyperon with the spin projection @xmath14 and @xmath15 to the direction @xmath16 of the incident particle momentum .    contains only term with square - law dependence of spin ( we consider t - invariant interactions , therefore the odd powers of spin in the amplitude should be absent ) .",
    "denoting magnetic quantum number through @xmath17 we obtain from equations ( [ ind_ref1]),([f0 ] ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the real and imaginary parts of the refraction index for the particle in an eigenstate with spin operator projection @xmath20 .",
    "it follows from , that the states with quantum numbers @xmath17 and @xmath21 are described by the same refraction indexes , however @xmath22 .",
    "thus this difference determines such effects as spin rotation and oscillation .",
    "in general case the hyperon spin wave function at a medium entry can be written as : @xmath23 using equations ( [ psi]),([ref_in2]),([psi0 ] ) , it is possible to find the expressions for describing polarization vector , quadrupole ( rank two ) and octupole tensors of @xmath24-hyperon as a function of a particle path length inside the target ( see appendix ) . in particular , for the polarization vector we have the following expressions : @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the particle way length inside the medium . from these expressions it follows , that in general case the spin dynamics of @xmath28 - hyperon is characterized by a superposition of two rotations in clockwise and counter - clockwise directions",
    ". let s consider some particular cases .",
    "if the initial polarization vector is normal to the particle momentum so , the initial populations and phases of the states with the quantum numbers @xmath17 are equal to the ones for the states with quantum numbers @xmath21 then the components @xmath29 , @xmath30 will remain zero during the whole time of particle penetration through the medium and @xmath31 oscillates . in the appendix it is shown , that the components of quadrupole and octupole tensors of @xmath0-hyperon oscillate too .",
    "if the initial polarization vector is directed at the acute angle to the momentum direction the polarization vector motion look like rotation .",
    "if the initial polarization vector is directed at the obtuse angle to the momentum direction the spin rotates in the opposite direction .",
    "let the @xmath0-hyperon passes through a hydrogen target . as it has been shown above the phenomenon of spin oscillations is determined by the forward scattering amplitude of @xmath0 on an unpolarized particle . to evaluate hyperon - proton scattering amplitude",

    "it can be obtained from the usual amplitude used in the formula ( [ ind_ref1 ] ) through division by a wave number @xmath6 ( small - angle scattering is meant ) .",

    "this allows us to calculate it in the particle rest frame , by integrating the ordinary distribution function @xmath48 over all @xmath49 coordinates , where @xmath50 and @xmath27-axes parallel to the incident particle momentum direction .    for simplicity",
