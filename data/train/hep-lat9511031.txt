    "the description of diffractive hadronic physics in terms of the exchange of a `` pomeron '' has proved remarkably durable , and has successfully withstood the advent of qcd .",
    "interest in the pomeron has been renewed by recent results from hera .",
    "total cross sections and diffractive processes are essentially soft in nature , and thus do not fall within the realm of perturbative qcd .",
    "thus any fixed - order perturbative calculation must be regarded purely as a model of the interaction , but one which may be representative of an all - orders qcd result",
    ". nevertheless , a successful phenomenological model of pomeron exchange is provided by two - gluon - exchange ( 2ge )  @xcite .",
    "crucial to this model is that the gluons be non - perturbative , i.e. infra - red finite , both to avoid the coulomb singularity at @xmath1 , and to provide the correct @xmath2-dependence of the differential cross section  @xcite .",
    "recently there has been a series of papers  @xcite investigating the phenomenology of the 2ge model in the form proposed by landshoff and nachtmann ( ln )  @xcite . in these papers a non - perturbative gluon propagator extracted from the solution of the schwinger - dyson equation  @xcite is inserted in the ln model . here",
    "we will explore the phenomenology of the same model , using gluon propagators extracted from lattice calculations in the landau gauge .",
    "our method has the advantage that one is inserting in the model a genuine , nonperturbative qcd quantity , which has been computed from first principles rather than derived from an approximate equation .",
    "also , as we will explain in the following , we have only one free parameter in our approach , whereas the schwinger - dyson solution depends on two parameters . for these reasons",
    ", we think that our approach provides in principle the best chance to test the success of the ln model from the point of view of qcd .",
    "the layout of the remainder of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we will summarise the lattice calculations , and present the results for the lattice gluon propagator . in section 3",
    "we will describe how we apply the measured gluon propagator to the calculation of cross - sections , and compare our results to the experimental data . in section 4 we comment on the issue of gauge dependence of our results .",
    "finally we present our conclusions .",
    "we use the standard lattice definition of the gluon fields in terms of the link variables @xcite , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the lattice spacing and @xmath5 the bare coupling constant .",
    "the gauge configurations are fixed to the landau gauge by imposing the gauge - fixing condition @xmath6 the accurate implementation of this step is crucial , and we use the fourier - accelerated algorithm of reference  @xcite .",
    "the unrenormalised gluon propagator in momentum space is obtained from the gauge - fixed gluon fields by taking the fourier transform @xmath7 in the continuum limit , we can write the landau - gauge propagator in the form @xmath8    we performed calculations on two sets of hypercubic lattices , corresponding to different physical volumes and lattice spacings .",
    "in addition , we used data for the gluon propagator as evaluated in reference  @xcite ; such data are particularly useful for an analysis of finite volume effects in our calculations .",
    "the parameters used are listed in table  [ tab : params ] .",
    "full details of the method and of the simulation for the hypercubic lattices are contained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".parameters of the lattices used in the calculation .",
    "the quoted value of the lattice spacing is obtained from an analysis of the string tension . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the general agreement between the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 obtained on the various lattices is striking , suggesting either that both quantities are subject to only small discretisation or finite volume effects , or that such effects are absorbed in @xmath11 .",
    "they are also encouragingly close to the phenomenological values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the quality of the fit to the data can be seen in figure  ( [ fig : isr_data ] ) , where we show isr data for the differential elastic cross section at @xmath14 together with the lattice predictions , with the energy correction of equation  ( [ eq : dsig_energy ] ) .",
    "though the agreement of the lattice computation with the experimental data is good , differences between the lattice results are now clearer , and suggest the need to repeat the calculation at different volumes and at different lattice spacings . in particular",
    ", our lattice at @xmath15 corresponds to a somewhat tiny physical volume for hadronic physics , so that finite volume effects may be non - negligible in that case .",
    "this process provides a further important test of the 2ge model , and in the following we adopt the analysis procedure of ducati _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the amplitude for meson - nucleon scattering is @xmath17 3\\left[f_n(q^2 ) - f_n(q^2 - \\frac{3}{2 } \\vec{q}\\cdot\\vec{k } + \\frac{3}{4}k^2)\\right].\\label{eq : jpsinucleon}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use the pole approximation for the form factors @xmath18 taking  @xcite @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "two phenomenological features are evident in the calculation .",
    "firstly , the quark - counting rule is closely satisfied in the case of the hadrons composed of light quarks : @xmath23 secondly , the pomeron couples more weakly to mesons composed of heavier quarks .",
    "this can be seen in figure  ( [ fig : jpsi ] ) where we show the meson - nucleon cross section as a function of the pole radius used in equation  ( [ eq : meson_ff ] ) , together with a regge fit to the energy - independent part of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 cross sections performed in reference  @xcite .",
    "the differences between the results on the different lattices reinforces the need to repeat the calculation on a wider range of lattice parameters .",
    "the issue of gauge dependence in the ln model is a difficult one .",
    "indeed , the starting point of ln is the leading - order perturbative calculation of a quark - quark scattering amplitude , with the constraint that no colour is exchanged between quarks .",
    "this is of course a gauge invariant quantity , expressed by a two - gluon exchange diagram . on the other hand ,",
    "ln argue that the salient features of pomeron physics can be captured by substituting in such a diagram the tree - level gluon propagator with an effective one , including non - perturbative self - energy effects , which should in particular account for the removal of the infrared pole .",
    "clearly any _ ansatz _ for the self - energy introduces in principle an uncontrollable gauge dependence in the calculation . given the phenomenological success of the model , one is led to think that maybe the gauge dependence intrinsic in the propagator is either mild by itself or gets suppressed ( cancels ) in the evaluation of physical quantities .",
    "we emphasise that this problem is inherent in the model and has nothing to do with using a lattice propagator . from the point of view of our method",
    ", one may speculate that the simplest conceivable mechanism for the suppression of gauge dependence would be if it gets  factored out \" in the definition of @xmath26 . in other words , a gauge dependent definition of @xmath11 may cancel most of the gauge dependence in the momentum space integrals of the propagator .",
    "we plan to investigate directly the issue of gauge dependence in a future work by using lattice propagators obtained in different gauges .",
    "we have demonstrated how the landau - gauge lattice gluon propagator employed in the two - gluon - exchange model of proton - proton scattering provides a highly successful description of the data , where the only parameter that needs to be fixed is an effective quark - gluon coupling .",
    "for the first time a genuine qcd quantity , evaluated entirely from first principles , has been inserted in the ln model , providing an important consistency check of the model itself .",
    "also , given the fact that in our approximation the effect of quark loops diagrams is absent , our analysis shows the robustness of the ln model , despite its simplicity .",
    "although the description of the data appears largely independent both of the volume of the lattice and of the lattice spacing , a more detailed analysis of lattice systematic errors is necessary .",
    "we plan to perform such an analysis , together with an investigation of the gauge dependence of our results , in a future publication .",
    "we wish to thank sandy donnachie and peter landshoff for useful conversations , and chris michael both for helpful conversations and for reading the manuscript .",
