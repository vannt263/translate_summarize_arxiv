    "baryons made of two or three heavy quarks offer an interesting alternative to quarkonium for studying the dynamics of non - relativistic systems in qcd and for investigating the transition region from coulombic to confined bound states .    the modern approach to quarkonium physics",
    "consists in taking advantage of the hierarchy of non - relativistic energy scales in the system by constructing a suitable hierarchy of effective field theories ( efts )  @xcite .",
    "the energy scales are the heavy - quark mass , @xmath0 , the typical momentum transfer , @xmath1 , whose inverse sets the typical distance , @xmath2 , between the heavy quark and the antiquark , and the typical kinetic energy , @xmath3 , whose inverse sets the typical time scale of the bound state . in the ultimate eft ,",
    "obtained after integrating out gluons of energy and momentum of the order of @xmath0 and @xmath4 , the interaction between heavy quarks is organized as an expansion in powers of @xmath5 and @xmath2 . at zeroth - order in @xmath2 , the interaction",
    "is entirely encoded in the quark - antiquark potential , which , at zeroth - order in @xmath5 , reduces to the static potential .",
    "terms proportional to powers of @xmath5 and @xmath2 can be systematically added .",
    "an analogous hierarchy of energy scales characterizes also baryons that contain at least two heavy quarks .",
    "hence , we may describe these systems by means of efts analogous to the ones suited for heavy quarkonium  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ultimate eft , obtained after integrating out gluons of energy and momentum of the order of the heavy - quark masses and of the typical momentum transfer between heavy quarks , is organized as an expansion in the inverse of the heavy - quark masses and in the distance between the heavy quarks . for equal heavy - quark masses ,",
    "the structure of the lagrangian and its power counting are similar to the quarkonium case ; the lagrangian reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 are terms containing the heavy quark or antiquark fields , which are proportional to @xmath8^j$ ] .",
    "the fields @xmath9 are @xmath10 light - quark fields , assumed to be massless . the heavy quark or antiquark fields in @xmath7",
    "are twice those in the bound state , e.g , in the quarkonium case , @xmath7 contains two quark and two antiquark fields . for different heavy - quark masses ,",
    "more scales are involved ; in the following , we will not consider such cases .",
    "although the efts for quarkonium and baryons made of two or three heavy quarks are similar in structure , they are characterized by different degrees of freedom .",
    "this is best seen when the typical distance between heavy quarks is smaller than the inverse of the hadronic scale @xmath11 , which is the case that we will discuss in this note . at these distances , gluons may resolve coloured degrees of freedom .",
    "these are gluons or light quarks or , in the quarkonium case , @xmath12 states in a colour singlet or in a colour octet configuration . in the case of baryons made of two heavy quarks @xmath13 and a light quark @xmath14 , at distances smaller than @xmath15",
    ", gluons can resolve gluons , light quarks and @xmath16 pairs in a colour antitriplet or in a colour sextet configuration .",
    "it is the binding of the antitriplet with the light quark @xmath14 that forms the @xmath17 baryon .",
    "the system very much resembles a heavy - light meson , with the heavy antiquark replaced by a @xmath16 antitriplet ; this fact may be exploited to deduce some properties of the @xmath17 baryons from the corresponding @xmath18 mesons  @xcite . in the case of baryons made of three heavy quarks @xmath13 , at distances smaller than @xmath15",
    ", gluons can resolve gluons , light quarks and @xmath19 states either in a colour singlet or in two different colour octets or in a colour decuplet configuration .",
    "the lattice evaluation of the @xmath19 static potential has a long tradition ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , while the static potential between a @xmath16 pair in the presence of a light quark has been evaluated on the lattice only recently  @xcite .",
    "expressions for the @xmath5 and the @xmath20 spin - dependent @xmath19 potentials in terms of wilson loops can be found in  @xcite , but have not been calculated on the lattice yet ( while the complete expressions of all the @xmath12 potentials up to order @xmath20 can be found in  @xcite and the most recent lattice determinations are in  @xcite ) .",
    "perturbative studies of the static potential may help to understand the transition region from the perturbative to the non - perturbative regime . in the case of the @xmath12 potential , this region is characterized by the smooth transition from a coulomb potential to a linear raising one ( for recent studies , see  @xcite ) . in the case of the @xmath19 static potential ,",
    "the transition from the perturbative to the non - perturbative regime is accompanied by the emergence of a three - body potential that depends on one length only ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "this is a rather spectacular phenomenon , which has been investigated only recently from a perturbative perspective  @xcite .",
    "there is so far no experimental evidence of @xmath19 baryons , while a few years ago the selex experiment has claimed evidence of possible doubly charmed baryon states  @xcite . until today",
    "this evidence has not been confirmed by other experiments , but is mostly behind the revival of interest in this kind of systems at the mid of this decade .",
    "the eft lagrangian that describes @xmath17 baryons below the momentum transfer scale @xmath4 , assumed to be larger than @xmath11 , has the general form of eq . , with @xmath7 made out of four quark fields  @xcite .",

    "hence , its dependence on the geometry is much smoother than the dependence on the geometry of the coulomb potential , although it still clearly depends on it .",
    "these features can be seen by plotting @xmath75 as a function of @xmath81 for two different set of configurations ; @xmath81 is the sum of the distances of the three quarks from the so - called fermat ( or torricelli ) point , which has minimum distance from the quarks .",
    "figure  [ fig : threebody](a ) shows the three - body potential when we place the three quarks in a plane @xmath82 , fix the position of the first quark in @xmath83 , the position of the second one in @xmath84 and move the third one in @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "the plot shows a weaker dependence on the geometry than in the previous case . as the comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : threebody](a ) indicates , the weaker dependence is an artifact of the chosen configurations rather than a physical effect . clearly , the precise identification of the transition region from a two - body dominated potential to a three - body dominated one would require to perform lattice calculations in geometries different from the one used in fig .",

    "choosing @xmath93 and @xmath94 to be respectively symmetric and antisymmetric for exchanges of the quarks located in @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( a different choice of the octet fields would correspond to a field redefinition leading to a different octet potential ) , we obtain @xmath95,\\ ] ] while at leading order the decuplet potential is @xmath96 we mention that there exist lattice data that show very clearly the singlet , octet and decuplet @xmath19 static potentials , although in an equilateral geometry , where the two octets are degenerate  @xcite .",
    "other terms in the effective lagrangian have been derived in @xcite .",
    "systems made of two or three heavy quarks or antiquarks develop similar hierarchies of energy scales and may be treated in similar eft frameworks .    in the case of @xmath12 mesons ,",
    "the static potential has been determined up to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order in perturbation theory and to a high accuracy on the lattice .",
    "the coulomb behaviour starts getting substantial modifications at distances around 0.2 fm turning over a linearly raising potential at larger distances .",
    "therefore the transition region can be studied to a large extent with perturbative methods .",
    "terms proportional to powers of @xmath5 and @xmath2 have been also calculated and included systematically in physical observables .    in the case of @xmath17 baryons ,",
    "the static potential has been determined up to nnlo in perturbation theory and recently also on the lattice .",
    "terms proportional to powers of @xmath5 and @xmath2 in the lagrangian have been matched ( mostly ) at leading order and used to determine , for instance , the expected hyperfine splitting of the ground state of these systems .",
    "if early experimental evidences will get confirmation in future experimental facilities , this will mark the beginning of a future new spectroscopy .",
    "finally , in the case of @xmath19 baryons , the static potential has been determined up to nnlo in perturbation theory and also on the lattice .",
    "the transition region from a coulomb to a linearly raising potential is characterized in this case also by the emergence of a three - body potential apparently parameterized by only one length .",
