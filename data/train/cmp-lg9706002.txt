    "the parsing of unrestricted text , with its enormous lexical and structural ambiguity , still poses a great challenge in natural language processing . the traditional approach of trying to master the complexity of parse grammars with hand - coded rules turned out to be much more difficult than expected , if not impossible .",
    "newer statistical approaches with often only very limited context sensitivity seem to have hit a performance ceiling even when trained on very large corpora .    to cope with the complexity of unrestricted text , parse rules in any kind of formalism will have to consider a complex context with many different morphological , syntactic or semantic features",
    ". this can present a significant problem , because even linguistically trained natural language developers have great difficulties writing and even more so extending explicit parse grammars covering a wide range of natural language . on the other hand",
    "it is much easier for humans to decide how _ specific _ sentences should be analyzed .",
    "we therefore propose an approach to parsing based on learning from examples with a very strong emphasis on context , integrating morphological , syntactic , semantic and other aspects relevant to making good parse decisions , thereby also allowing the parsing to be deterministic .",
    "applying machine learning techniques , the system uses parse action examples acquired under supervision to generate a deterministic shift - reduce type parser in the form of a decision structure .",
    "the generated parser transforms input sentences into an integrated phrase - structure and case - frame tree , powerful enough to be fed into a transfer and a generation module to complete the full process of machine translation .",
    "balanced by rich context and some background knowledge , our corpus based approach relieves the nl - developer from the hard if not impossible task of writing explicit grammar rules and keeps grammar coverage increases very manageable .",
    "compared with standard statistical methods , our system relies on deeper analysis and more supervision , but radically fewer examples .",
    "as the basic mechanism for parsing text into a shallow semantic representation , we choose a shift - reduce type parser @xcite .",
    "it breaks parsing into an ordered sequence of small and manageable parse actions such as shift and reduce .",
    "this ordered ` left - to - right ' parsing is much closer to how humans parse a sentence than , for example , chart oriented parsers ; it allows a very transparent control structure and makes the parsing process relatively intuitive for humans .",
    "this is very important , because during the training phase , the system is guided by a human supervisor for whom the flow of control needs to be as transparent and intuitive as possible .",
    "the parsing does not have separate phases for part - of - speech selection and syntactic and semantic processing , but rather integrates all of them into a single parsing phase .",
    "since the system has all morphological , syntactic and semantic context information available at all times , the system can make well - based decisions very early , allowing a single path , i.e.  deterministic parse , which eliminates wasting computation on ` dead end ' alternatives .",
    "before the parsing itself starts , the input string is segmented into a list of words incl .",
    "punctuation marks , which then are sent through a morphological analyzer that , using a lexicon , produces primitive frames for the segmented words . a word gets a primitive frame for each possible part of speech .",

    "+    the central data structure for the parser consists of a parse stack and an input list .",
    "the parse stack and the input list contain trees of frames of words or phrases .",
    "core slots of frames are surface and lexical form , syntactic and semantic category , subframes with syntactic and semantic roles , and form restrictions such as number , person , and tense .",
    "optional slots include special information like the numerical value of number words .    initially , the parse stack is empty and the input list contains the primitive frames produced by the morphological analyzer .",
    "after initialization , the _ deterministic parser",
    "_ applies a sequence of _ parse actions _ to the parse structure .",
    "the most frequent parse actions are _ shift _ , which shifts a frame from the input list onto the parse stack or backwards , and _ reduce _ , which combines one or several frames on the parse stack into one new frame .",
    "the frames to be combined are typically , but not necessarily , next to each other at the top of the stack .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_reduce_action ] , the action    ....      ( r 2 to vp as pred ( obj pat ) ) ....    for example reduces the two top frames of the stack into a new frame that is marked as a verb phrase and contains the next - to - the - top frame as its predicate ( or head ) and the top frame of the stack as its object and patient .",
    "other parse actions include _ add - into _ , which adds frames arbitrarily deep into an existing frame tree , _ mark _ , which can mark any slot of any frame with any value , and operations to introduce empty categories ( i.e.  traces and ` pro ' , as in `` she@xmath0 wanted pro@xmath0 to win . '' ) .",
    "parse actions can have numerous arguments , making the _ parse action language _ very powerful .",
    "the parse action sequences needed for training the system are acquired interactively . for each training sentence ,",
    "the system and the supervisor parse the sentence step by step , with the supervisor entering the next parse action , e.g.  ( r 2 to vp as pred ( obj pat ) ) , and the system executing it , repeating this sequence until the sentence is fully parsed . at least for the very first sentence",
    ", the supervisor actually has to type in the entire parse action sequence . with a growing number of parse action examples available , the system , as described below in more detail ,",
    "can be trained using those previous examples .",
    "in such a partially trained system , the parse actions are then proposed by the system using a parse decision structure which `` classifies '' the current context .",
    "the proper classification is the specific action or sequence of actions that ( the system believes ) should be performed next . during further training",
    ", the supervisor then enters parse action commands by either confirming what the system proposes or overruling it by providing the proper action .",
    "as the corpus of parse examples grows and the system is trained on more and more data , the system becomes more refined , so that the supervisor has to overrule the system with decreasing frequency .",
    "the sequence of correct parse actions for a sentence is then recorded in a log file .",
    "to make good parse decisions , a wide range of features at various degrees of abstraction have to be considered . to express such a wide range of features , we defined a _",
    "feature language_. parse features can be thought of as functions that map from partially parsed sentences to a value . applied to the target parse state of figure  [ fig_reduce_action ] , the feature _ ( synt of obj of -1 at s - synt - elem ) _ , for example , designates the general syntactic class of the object of the first frame of the parse stack , in our example _",
    "np_. so , features do not a priori operate on words or phrases , but only do so if their description references such words or phrases , as in our example through the _ path _ ` obj of -1 ' .    given a particular parse state and a feature ,",
    "the system can interpret the feature and compute its value for the given parse state , often using additional background knowledge such as    1 .   a _ knowledge base _ ( kb ) , which currently consists of a directed acyclic graph of 4356 mostly semantic and syntactic concepts connected by 4518 _ is - a _ links , e.g.   `` @xmath1 is - a + @xmath2 '' .",
    "most concepts representing words are at a fairly shallow level of the kb , e.g.  under ` tangible object ' , ` abstract ' , ` process verb ' , or ` adjective ' , with more depth used only in concept areas more relevant for making parse and translation decisions , such as temporal , spatial and animate concepts",
    ". 2 .   a _ subcategorization table _ that describes the syntactic and semantic role structures for verbs , with currently 242 entries .",
    "the following representative examples , for easier understanding rendered in english and not in feature language syntax , further illustrate the expressiveness of the feature language :    * the general syntactic class of @xmath3 ( the third element of the parse stack ) : e.g.  verb , adj , np , * whether or not the adverbial alternative of @xmath4 ( the top element of the input list ) is an adjectival degree adverb , * the specific finite tense of @xmath5 , e.g.  present tense , * whether or not @xmath5 contains an object , * the semantic role of @xmath5 with respect to @xmath6 : e.g.  agent , time ; this involves pattern matching with corresponding entries in the verb subcategorization table , * whether or not @xmath6 and @xmath5 satisfy subject - verb agreement",
    ".    features can in principal refer to any one or several elements on the parse stack or input list , and any of their subelements , at any depth .",
    "since the currently 205 features are supposed to bear some linguistic relevance , none of them are unjustifiably remote from the current focus of a parse state .",
    "the feature collection is basically independent from the supervised parse action acquisition . before learning a decision structure for the first time",
    ", the supervisor has to provide an initial set of features that can be considered obviously relevant . particularly during the early development of our system , this set",
    "was increased whenever parse examples had identical values for all current features but nevertheless demanded different parse actions .",
    "given a specific conflict pair of partially parsed sentences , the supervisor would add a new relevant feature that discriminates the two examples .",
    "we expect our feature set to grow to eventually about 300 features when scaling up further within the wall street journal domain , and quite possibly to a higher number when expanding into new domains",
    ". however , such feature set additions require fairly little supervisor effort .    given ( 1 ) a log file with the correct parse action sequence of training sentences as acquired under supervision and ( 2 ) a set of features , the system revisits the training sentences and computes values for all features at each parse step . together with the recorded parse actions these feature vectors form _ parse examples",
    "_ that serve as input to the learning unit .",
    "whenever the feature set is modified , this step must be repeated , but this is unproblematic , because this process is both fully automatic and fast .",
    "traditional statistical techniques also use features , but often have to sharply limit their number ( for some trigram approaches to three fairly simple features ) to avoid the loss of statistical significance .    in parsing , only a very small number of features are crucial over a wide range of examples , while most features are critical in only a few examples , being used to ` fine - tune ' the decision structure for special cases .",
    "so in order to overcome the antagonism between the importance of having a large number of features and the need to control the number of examples required for learning , particularly when acquiring parse action sequence under supervision , we choose a decision - tree based learning algorithm , which recursively selects the most discriminating feature of the corresponding subset of training examples , eventually ignoring all locally irrelevant features , thereby tailoring the size of the final decision structure to the complexity of the training data .    while parse actions might be complex for the action interpreter , they are atomic with respect to the decision structure learner ; e.g.  `` ( r 2 to vp as pred ( obj pat ) ) '' would be such an atomic _",
    "classification_. a set of _ parse examples _ , as already described in the previous section , is then fed into an id3-based learning routine that generates a decision structure , which can then ` classify ' any given parse state by proposing what parse action to perform next .",
    "we extended the standard id3 model @xcite to more general hybrid decision structures . in our tests ,",
    "the best performing structure was a decision list @xcite of hierarchical decision trees , whose simplified basic structure is illustrated in figure  [ csg_dec_structure1 ] .",
    "note that in the ` reduce operation tree ' , the system first decides whether or not to perform a reduction before deciding on a specific reduction . using our knowledge of similarity of parse actions and the exceptionality vs.  generality of parse action groups",
    ", we can provide an overhead structure that helps prevent data fragmentation .",
    "the output tree generated by the parser can be used for translation .",
    "a transfer module recursively maps the source language parse tree to an equivalent tree in the target language , reusing the methods developed for parsing with only minor adaptations .",
    "the main purpose of learning here is to resolve translation ambiguities , which arise for example when translating the english `` _ to know _ '' to german ( _ wissen / kennen _ ) or spanish ( _ saber / conocer _ ) .",
    "besides word pair entries , the _ bilingual dictionary _ also contains pairs of phrases and expressions in a format closely resembling traditional ( paper ) dictionaries , e.g.  `` to comment on something_1''/``sich zu etwas_dat_1 uern '' .",
    "even if a complex translation pair does not bridge a structural mismatch , it can make a valuable contribution to disambiguation .",
    "consider for example the term `` interest rate '' .",
    "both element nouns are highly ambiguous with respect to german , but the english _ compound _ conclusively maps to the german compound `` zinssatz '' .",
    "we believe that an extensive collection of complex translation pairs in the bilingual dictionary is critical for translation quality and we are confident that its acquisition can be at least partially automated by using techniques like those described in @xcite .",
    "complex translation entries are preprocessed using the same parser as for normal text . during the transfer process ,",
    "the resulting parse tree pairs are then accessed using pattern matching .",
    "the generation module orders the components of phrases , adds appropriate punctuation , and propagates morphologically relevant information in order to compute the proper form of surface words in the target language .",
    "we now present intermediate results on training and testing a prototype implementation of the system with sentences from the wall street journal , a prominent corpus of ` real ' text , as collected on the acl - cd .    in order to limit the size of the required lexicon",
    ", we work on a reduced corpus of 105,356 sentences , a tenth of the full corpus , that includes all those sentences that are fully covered by the 3000 most frequently occurring words ( ignoring numbers etc . ) in the entire corpus .",
    "the first 272 sentences used in this experiment vary in length from 4 to 45 words , averaging at 17.1 words and 43.5 parse actions per sentence .",
    "one of these sentence is  _",
    "canadian manufacturers new orders fell to $ 20.80 billion ( cana- _    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    table  [ fig - rel_work ] compares our results with spatter and bld .",
    "the results have to be interpreted cautiously since they are not based on the exact same sentences and detail of bracketing .",
    "due to lexical restrictions , our average sentence length ( 17.1 ) is below the one used in spatter and bld ( 22.3 ) , but some of our test sentences have more than 40 words ; and while the penn treebank leaves many phrases such as `` the new york stock exchange '' without internal structure , our system performs a complete bracketing , thereby increasing the risk of crossing brackets .",
    "we try to bridge the gap between the typically hard - to - scale hand - crafted approach and the typically large - scale but context - poor statistical approach for unrestricted text parsing .      * a rich and unified context with 205 features , * a complex parse action language that allows integrated part of speech tagging and syntactic and semantic processing , * a sophisticated decision structure that generalizes traditional decision trees and lists , * a balanced use of machine learning and _ micromodular _ background knowledge , i.e.  very small pieces of highly independent information * a modest number of interactively acquired examples from the wall street journal ,      * computes parse trees and translations fast ,",
    "because it uses a deterministic single - pass parser , * shows good robustness when encountering novel constructions , * produces good parsing results comparable to those of the leading statistical methods , and * delivers competitive results for machine translations .",
    "while many limited - context statistical approaches have already reached a performance ceiling , we still expect to significantly improve our results when increasing our training base beyond the currently 256 sentences , because the learning curve hasnt flattened out yet and adding substantially more examples is still very feasible .",
    "even then the training size will compare favorably with the huge number of training sentences necessary for many statistical systems ."
