    "recent progress in our understanding of faint galaxy data made possible by the combination of _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) deep imaging and ground - based spectroscopy has dramatically increased our knowledge of the evolution of the stellar birthrate in optically - selected galaxies from the present - epoch up to @xmath9 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the explosion in the quantity of information available on the high - redshift universe at optical wavelengths has been complemented by the measurement of the far - ir / sub - mm background by dirbe and firas onboard the _ cobe _ satellite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , by the detection of distant ultraluminous sub - mm sources with the scuba camera @xcite , @xcite , and by theoretical progress made in understanding how intergalactic gas follows the dynamics dictated by dark matter halos until radiative , hydrodynamic , and star formation processes take over @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the ir data have revealed the ` optically - hidden ' side of galaxy formation , and shown that a significant fraction of the energy released by stellar nucleosynthesis is re - emitted as thermal radiation by dust @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the underlying goal of all these efforts is to understand the growth of cosmic structures , the internal properties of galaxies and their evolution , and ultimately to map the star formation history of the universe from the end of the cosmic ` dark age ' to the present epoch .    in this talk",
    "i will focus on the galaxy number - apparent magnitude relation and its first moment , the integrated galaxy contribution to the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "the logarithmic slope of the differential galaxy counts is a remarkably simple cosmological probe of the history of stellar birth in galaxies , as it must drop below 0.4 to yield a finite value for the ebl .",
    "the recently released _",
    "hubble deep field - south _ ( hdf - s ) images , together with other existing _ hst _ and ground - based observations , provide a unique dataset to estimate the spectrum and amplitude of the optical ebl from discrete sources . together with the far - ir / sub - mm background , the optical ebl is an indicator of the total luminosity of the universe , as the cumulative emission from young and evolved galactic systems , as well as from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , is recorded in this background . as such it provides , for a given initial mass function , a quantitative estimate of the baryonic mass that has been processed by stars throughout cosmic history .",

    "all magnitudes have been corrected to the ab system , while the second order colour corrections for the differences in the filter effective wavelengths have not been applied to the ground - based data ( for the typical colours of galaxies in the hdf these corrections are less than 0.1 mag ) .",
    "the hdf optical counts agree well with previous surveys , to within @xmath27 in the magnitude range @xmath28 .",
    "one should note , however , that different algorithms used for ` growing ' the photometry beyond the outer isophotes of galaxies can significantly change the magnitude of faint galaxies . according to @xcite , roughly 50% of the flux from resolved galaxies with @xmath29 mag lie outside the standard - sized apertures used by photometric packages .",
    "an extragalactic sky pedestal created by the overlapping wings of resolved galaxies may also contribute significantly to the sky level , and would be undetectable except by absolute surface photometry @xcite .",
    "also , at faint magnitude levels , distant objects which are brighter than the nominal depth of the catalog may be missed due to the @xmath30 dimming factor .",
    "all these systematic errors are inherent in _ hst _ faint - galaxy photometry ; as a result , our estimate of the integrated flux from resolved galaxies will typically be too low , and must be strictly considered as a _ lower limit_.",
    "the contribution of known galaxies to the optical ebl can be calculated directly by integrating the emitted flux times the differential number counts down to the detection threshold .",
    "i have used the compilation of ground - based , _ hst _ , and hdf data shown in figure 1 to compute the integrated flux at @xmath31 m .",
    "in all seven bands , the slope of the differential number - magnitude relation is flatter than 0.4 above @xmath32 ( 25 ) at near - ir ( optical ) wavelengths , and this flattening appears to be more pronounced at the shorter wavelengths . the leveling off of the counts is clearly seen in figure 1 , where the function @xmath20 is plotted against apparent magnitude in all bands . while counts having a logarithmic slope @xmath33 continue to add to the ebl at the faintest magnitudes , it appears that the hdf survey has achieved the sensitivity to capture the bulk of the near - ultraviolet , optical , and near - ir extragalactic light from discrete sources .",
    "the flattening at faint apparent magnitudes can not be due to the reddening of distant sources as their lyman break gets redshifted into the blue passband , since the fraction of lyman - break galaxies at ( say ) @xmath34 is only of order 10% @xcite .",
    "moreover , an absorption - induced loss of sources can not explain the similar change of slope in the @xmath35 and @xmath15 bands .",

    "recent estimates of the optical ebl at 3000 , 5500 , and 8000    from absolute surface photometry by @xcite lie between a factor of two to three higher than the integrated light from galaxy counts . applying this correction factor to the range 30008000",

    "when combined with the dirbe @xcite , @xcite , @xcite points at 140 and 240 @xmath37 m , one gets a far - ir background intensity of @xmath43 .",

    "a direct estimate of the contribution of quasars to the ebl depends on the poorly known bolometric correction and the possible existence of a distant population of dusty agns with strong intrinsic absorption , as invoked in many models for the x - ray background .",

    "is estimated to be @xmath48 @xcite , implying a mean mass density of quasar remnants today @xmath49 since the observed energy density from all quasars is equal to the emitted energy divided by the average quasar redshift , the total contribution to the ebl from accretion onto black holes is @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , where @xmath52 is the efficiency of accreted mass to radiation conversion ( in units of 5% ) . therefore ,",
    "unless dust - obscured accretion onto supermassive black holes is a very efficient process ( @xmath53 ) , a population of quasars peaking at @xmath54 is expected to make a contribution to the brightness of the night sky not exceeding 1020% @xcite , @xcite .    .",

    "with the help of some simple stellar population synthesis tools we can now set a lower limit to the total stellar mass density that produced the observed sky brightness and constrain the cosmic history of star birth in galaxies .",
    "one of the most serious uncertainties in this calculation has always been the lower cutoff ( usually treated as a free parameter ) of the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "observations of m subdwarfs stars with the _ hst _ have recently shed some light on this issue , showing that the imf in the galactic disk can be represented analytically over the mass range @xmath55 ( here @xmath56 is in solar units ) by @xmath57 ( @xcite , hereafter gbf ) . for @xmath58",
    "this mass distribution agrees well with a salpeter function .",
    "observations of normal galactic star - forming regions also show some convergence in the basic form of the imf at intermediate and high masses , a power - law slope that is consistent with the salpeter value @xcite . in the following",
    "i will use a ` universal ' imf with the gbf form for @xmath59 , matched to a salpeter slope for @xmath60 ; the mass integral of this function is 0.6 times that obtained extrapolating a salpeter function down to @xmath61 .",

    "about 1.3 mev per stellar baryon are radiated away .",
    "this number depends only weakly on the assumed metallicity of stars . in a stellar system with arbitrary star formation rate per comoving cosmological volume , @xmath73 , and formation epoch @xmath74 , the comoving bolometric",
    "emissivity at time @xmath75 is given by the convolution integral @xmath76 the total background light observed at earth ( @xmath77 ) is @xmath78 where the factor @xmath79 at the denominator is lost to cosmic expansion when converting from observed to radiated ( comoving ) luminosity density . to set a lower limit to the present - day mass density , @xmath7 , of processed gas @xmath5 stars ( in units of the critical density @xmath80 ) , consider now a scenario where",
    "all stars are formed instantaneously at redshift @xmath64 .",
    "the background light that would be observed at earth from such an event is shown in figure 4 as a function of @xmath64 for @xmath81 ( corresponding to 9 , 6.5 , and 4 percent of the nucleosynthetic baryon density , @xmath82 @xcite ) , and two different cosmologies .",
    "a couple of points are worth noting here : ( 1 ) the time evolution of the luminosity radiated by a simple stellar population makes the dependence of the observed ebl from @xmath64 much shallower than the @xmath83 lost to cosmic expansion , as the energy output from stars is spread over their respective lifetimes ; and ( 2 ) in order to generate an ebl at a level of @xmath6 , one requires @xmath84 ( for an eds universe with @xmath51 ) , hence a mean mass - to - blue light ratio today of @xmath85 for a present - day blue luminosity density of @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , the dependence of these estimates on the cosmological model is rather weak . with the adopted imf , about 30% of this mass",
    "will be returned to the interstellar medium in @xmath87 yr after intermediate - mass stars eject their envelopes and massive stars explode as supernovae .",
    "this ` return fraction ' , @xmath88 , becomes 50% after about 10 gyr .    a visible mass density at the level of the above lower limit , @xmath89 , while able to explain the measured sky brightness , requires all the stars that give origin to the observed light to have formed at @xmath90 , and is , as such , rather implausible .",
    "a more realistic scenario appears to be one where the star formation density evolves as @xmath91 this model fits reasonably well all measurements of the uv - continuum and h@xmath92 luminosity densities from the present - epoch to @xmath93 after an extinction correction of @xmath94 mag ( @xmath95 mag ) is applied to the data @xcite , and produce a total ebl of the right magnitude ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "since about half of the present - day stars are formed at @xmath97 ( hence their contribution to the ebl is redshifted away ) , the resulting visible mass density is @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "note that this estimate ignores the recycling of returned gas into new stars .",
    "the observed ebl therefore requires that between 7% and 16% of the nucleosynthetic baryons are today in the forms of stars , processed gas , and their remnants .",
    "according to the most recent census of cosmic baryons , the mass density in stars and their remnants observed today is @xmath100 @xcite , corresponding to a mean visible mass - to - blue light ratio of @xmath101 ( @xmath51 ) ( about 70% of this mass is found in old spheroidal populations ) .",
    "while this is about a factor of 2.5 smaller than the visible mass density predicted by equation ( [ eq : mplot ] ) , efficient recycling of ejected material into new star formation would tend to reduce the apparent discrepancy in the budget .",
    "alternatively , the gas returned by stars may be ejected into the intergalactic medium . with an imf - averaged yield of returned metals of @xmath102,^{-1}$ ] , the stellar yields @xmath103 of @xcite , and a gbf@xmath5salpeter imf . ]",
