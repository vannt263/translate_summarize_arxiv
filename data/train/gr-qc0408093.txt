    "braneworld models have become quite popular in the high - energy and gravitational physics during last several years .",
    "there are at least three reasons for this .",
    "firstly , most of the brane models , in particular , the randall  sundrum model @xcite , are inspired directly by the popular string theory ( specifically , by the horava ",
    "witten model @xcite ) and represent an interesting alternative for compactification of extra spatial dimensions .",
    "secondly , there remains a possibility of solving the mass - hierarchy problem in the context of large extra dimensions ( see @xcite ) . and",
    "thirdly , it has been shown that models with non - compact extra dimensions and branes can be consistent with the current gravity experiments .",
    "braneworld models also turned out to be consistent with modern cosmology , at the same time exhibiting new specific features .",
    "first of all , this concerns the braneworld models of `` dark energy , '' or of the currently observed acceleration of the universe ( see @xcite in this respect ) , but this is also true with respect to the early stages of cosmological evolution such as inflation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    a broad class of cosmological solutions in braneworld theory was systematically analyzed by campos and sopuerta @xcite using convenient phase space variables similar to those introduced in @xcite .",
    "these authors gave a complete description of stationary points in an appropriately chosen phase space of the cosmological setup and investigated their stability with respect to homogeneous and isotropic perturbations .",
    "the authors worked in the frames of the randall  sundrum braneworld theory without the scalar - curvature term in the action for the brane . in this paper",
    ", we are going to extend this analysis by investigating the case where this term is present in the action .",
    "the scalar - curvature term for the brane was introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) as a method of making gravity on the brane effectively four - dimensional even in the flat infinite bulk space .",
    "the corresponding cosmological models were initiated in @xcite .",
    "the necessity of this term on the brane arises when one considers the complete effective action of the theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . from this viewpoint ,",
    "the term with brane tension represents the zero - order term in the expansion of the total action for the brane in powers of curvature of the induced metric , while the next term in the action for the brane is exactly the scalar - curvature hilbert ",
    "einstein term . from another ( complementary ) viewpoint @xcite ,",
    "this contribution is induced as a quantum correction to the effective action for the brane gravity after one takes into account the quantum character of the matter confined to the brane .    in this paper",
    ", we will show that the presence of the scalar - curvature term in the action for the brane enlarges the class of cosmological solutions , in particular , it allows for the existence of static cosmological solutions with ordinary matter content even in the case of spatially flat or open cosmology , a specific feature of the braneworld cosmology that was also noted in @xcite . in the randall  sundrum model ,",
    "flat or open static universe with ordinary matter requires the presence of the negative dark - radiation term , while , in the model with scalar - curvature term in the action for the brane to be discussed in this paper , the presence of dark radiation may be not necessary .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :   in sec .",
    "[ basic ] , we introduce the basic equations describing the theory with one brane in the five - dimensional bulk space .",
    "then , in sec .  [ static ] , we introduce a method for the investigation of static solutions . using this method ,",
    "we describe both the general - relativity case and the case of braneworld theory that contains the scalar - curvature term in the action for the brane . in the partial case of spatially flat universe , we determine the range of parameters where static solutions exist and where they are stable with respect to homogeneous and isotropic perturbations . in sec .",
    "[ nonstatic ] , we develop an approach which is used to describe non - static solutions , and apply it to the braneworld theory under investigation . in sec .  [ static - case ] , we return to the issue of static solutions with arbitrary spatial curvature using conveniently chosen variables . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "in this paper , we consider the case where the braneworld is the time - like boundary of a five - dimensional purely gravitational lorentzian space ( bulk ) , which is equivalent to the case of a brane embedded in the bulk with @xmath0 symmetry of reflection with respect to the brane .",
    "the theory is described by the action @xcite : @xmath1-\\int_{\\rm brane}(m^2r-2\\sigma)+\\int_{\\rm brane } l(h_{ab},\\phi)\\ , .\\ ] ] here , @xmath2 is the scalar curvature of the metric @xmath3 in the five - dimensional bulk , and @xmath4 is the scalar curvature of the induced metric @xmath5 on the brane , where @xmath6 is the vector field of the inner unit normal to the brane , and the notation and conventions of @xcite are used . the quantity @xmath7 is the trace of the symmetric tensor of extrinsic curvature @xmath8 on the brane .",
    "the symbol @xmath9 denotes the lagrangian density of the four - dimensional matter fields @xmath10 whose dynamics is restricted to the brane so that they interact only with the induced metric @xmath11 .",
    "all integrations over the bulk and brane are taken with the natural volume elements @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the determinants of the matrices of components of the corresponding metrics in a coordinate basis .",
    "the symbols @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote , respectively , the five- and four - dimensional planck masses , @xmath18 is the bulk cosmological constant , and @xmath19 is the brane tension .",
    "the term containing the scalar curvature of the induced metric on the brane with the coupling @xmath20 in action ( [ act ] ) was originally absent from braneworld models . however , very soon it became clear that this term is qualitatively essential for describing the braneworld dynamics and , moreover , it is inevitably generated as a quantum correction to the matter action in ( [ act ] )  in the spirit of an idea that goes back to sakharov @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "note that the effective action for the brane typically involves an infinite number of terms of higher order in curvature ( this was pointed out in @xcite for the case of braneworld theory ; a similar situation in the context of the ads / cft correspondence is described in @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we retain only the terms linear in curvature .",
    "the effects of the curvature term on the brane in linear approximation were studied in @xcite , where it was shown that it leads to four - dimensional law of gravity on sufficiently small scales .",
    "the presence of this term also leads to qualitatively new features in cosmology , as demonstrated , in particular , in @xcite .",
    "for some recent reviews of the results connected with the induced - gravity term in the brane action , one may look into @xcite .",
    "variation of action ( [ act ] ) gives us the equations describing the dynamics in the bulk @xmath21 and on the brane @xmath22 the second equation generalizes the israel junction conditions @xcite and the corresponding equation of the randall  sundrum model to the presence of the scalar - curvature term on the brane ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "one can consider the gauss identity @xmath24 and , following the original procedure of @xcite , contract it once on the brane using equations ( [ eq_mot1 ] ) and ( [ eq_mot2 ] ) . in this way , one obtains the effective equation on the brane that generalizes the result of @xcite to the presence of the brane curvature term : @xmath25 where @xmath26 @xmath27 is the quadratic expression with respect to the ` bare ' einstein equation @xmath28 on the brane , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is a projection of the bulk weyl tensor @xmath31 to the brane .",
    "the limit of @xmath32 leads us to the original result of @xcite .    contracting eq .",
    "( [ effective ] ) once again , one obtains the following scalar equation on the brane : @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "it is argued in @xcite that , if one is interested only in the evolution on the brane and if no additional boundary or regularity conditions are specified in the bulk ( as often is the case ) , then one is left only with this scalar equation .",
    "having obtained a solution of ( [ 2nd ] ) , one can integrate the gravitational equations in the bulk using , for example , gaussian normal coordinates @xcite .",
    "the brane filled by a homogeneous and isotropic ideal fluid is described by the friedmann ",
    "walker ( frw ) metric @xmath35\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , or @xmath38 .",
    "the stress ",
    "energy tensor of the ideal fluid takes the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the energy density , and @xmath41 is the pressure . in this paper",
    ", we assume a simple equation of state @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is constant .",
    "equation ( [ 2nd ] ) leads to the following cosmological equation in the braneworld theory : @xmath44 + \\left[\\rho(1 + 3w)-2\\sigma+6m^2\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a}\\right ] \\left[\\rho+\\sigma - 3m^2\\left(h^2+\\frac{\\kappa}{a^2}\\right)\\right]=0\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the hubble parameter . after multiplying this equation by @xmath46 and using the conservation of energy",
    "@xmath47 one can integrate eq .",
    "( [ second ] ) and obtain the first - order differential equation @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the integration constant corresponding to the black - hole mass of the schwarzschild(anti)-de  sitter solution in the bulk and associated with what is called `` dark radiation . ''",
    "equation ( [ 1st ] ) can be solved with respect to the hubble parameter : @xmath50\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the crossover length scale characterizing the theory .",
    "the ` @xmath52 ' signs give the two different branches of braneworld solutions which , to some extent , are connected with the two different ways in which the schwarzschild(anti)-de sitter bulk space is bounded by the brane : the inner normal to the brane can point either in the direction of increasing or decreasing of the bulk radial coordinate .",
    "following @xcite , we refer to the model with the lower sign ( ` @xmath53 ' ) as to brane1 , and to that with the upper sign ( ` @xmath54 ' ) as to brane2 .    in the formal limit of @xmath32 , the brane1 model reduces to the well - known expression obtained in the randall  sundrum case @xmath55 while the brane2 model does not exist in this limit .",
    "this can be viewed as a simple consequence of the fact that eq .",
    "( [ 1st ] ) , being quadratic with respect of the hubble parameter @xmath56 in the case @xmath23 , reduces to a linear equation with respect to @xmath56 in the formal limit @xmath32 .",
    "we proceed to the investigation of static solutions in the braneworld theory .",
    "first , we review the situation in the general relativity theory , where the static einstein s universe is known to be unstable .",
    "we apply the same method for the investigation of the stability of static solutions in the braneworld theory and demonstrate new possibilities arising in this theory .",
    "firstly , unlike general relativity , the braneworld theory admits static solutions even in the case of spatially flat or open universe , which , in the context of the randall  sundrum model , was also noted in @xcite . in the randall  sundrum model , static spatially flat or open universes with matter satisfying the strong energy condition are possible only with negative value of the dark - radiation constant @xmath49 , while , in the presence of the scalar - curvature term in the action for the brane , a spatially flat or open universe can be static even when this constant is zero .",
    "secondly , these solutions can be stable in certain region of parameters .      in this section",
    ", we review the situation in the general relativity theory with the standard action @xmath57 and describe our method for investigation of the stability of static solutions on the example of this theory .",
    "a homogenous and isotropic universe with density @xmath40 and pressure @xmath58 is described by the friedmann equations @xmath59 @xmath60 giving the following conditions of static solution : @xmath61 @xmath62 introducing small homogeneous deviations from stationarity , @xmath63 and linearizing the friedmann equations ( [ gr - first ] ) and ( [ gr - second ] ) with respect to the small quantity @xmath64 , we have : @xmath65 @xmath66 we note that the weak energy condition and casuality requirements restrict the value of @xmath43 to lie in the interval @xmath67 $ ] ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and , as a result , @xmath68 . taking this into account , one can see from ( [ gr ] ) that the static solution in this theory is unstable for @xmath69 $ ] , and stable for @xmath70 .",
    "one can use the method outlined in the previous section to investigate the braneworld theory . in this section ,",
    "we find ( analytically and graphically ) the regions of existence of static solutions in the parameter space and then further restrict the space of parameters by the requirement that the described theory be physically compatible with the observations .      in the static case ,",
    "equations ( [ second ] ) and ( [ 1st ] ) give @xmath71 \\left(\\rho+\\sigma - 3m^2\\frac{\\kappa}{a^2}\\right)=0\\ ] ] and @xmath72 respectively .",
    "one should note that eq .",
    "( [ 1st0 ] ) can not be obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ second ] ) in the static case because , before integration , eq .  ( [ second ] ) is multiplied by @xmath73 , which , in this case , is identically zero .",
    "nevertheless , it can be obtained from the original equations on the brane ( [ eq_mot2 ] ) considering the embedding of the brane in the bulk .",
    "in fact , this equation determines the value of the black - hole constant @xmath49 for which a solution of ( [ second0 ] ) is embeddable in the schwarzschild(anti)-de  sitter bulk .",
    "looking for static solutions and investigating their stability , we proceed as in the previous case of general relativity .",
    "first , we solve eq .",
    "( [ second ] ) with respect to @xmath74 for @xmath75 : @xmath76 \\left(\\rho+\\sigma - 3m^2\\frac{\\kappa}{a^2}\\right)}{9m^{6}+6m^2\\left(\\rho+ \\sigma-3m^2\\frac{\\kappa}{a^2}\\right)}\\ , .\\ ] ] studying homogeneous perturbations of this solution , we set @xmath77 as the initial condition .",
    "if a solution is stable ( unstable ) with respect to such perturbations , it will also be stable ( unstable ) with respect to more generic perturbations with @xmath78 .",
    "thus , we assume that the relation between @xmath40 and @xmath79 is given by eq .",
    "( [ 1st0 ] ) at the initial moment of time .",
    "we express the energy density @xmath40 through @xmath79 using eq .",
    "( [ 1st0 ] ) , @xmath80 and substitute it to ( [ 1st1 ] ) : @xmath81 where @xmath82 @xmath83    after that , we introduce the perturbation of the static solution @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a stationary solution of ( [ 1st2 ] ) , and expand eq .",
    "( [ 1st2 ] ) around the stationary point : @xmath86 where @xmath87 @xmath88 the lower and upper signs in these equations refer to the brane1 and brane2 models , respectively .",
    "it can also be noted @xcite that , unlike the general relativity theory , the braneworld theory allows for empty ( @xmath89 ) static solutions .",
    "the radius ( scale factor ) of such a universe is given by the expression @xcite @xmath90 the spatially flat case requires @xmath91 .",
    "observations indicate that , at the present cosmological epoch , our universe expands with acceleration , so that the simplest asymptotic condition for such a universe is that the energy density will decrease monotonically to zero .",
    "thus , we can consider the low - energy behavior of the theory as @xmath92 : @xmath93 which is valid under the condition @xmath94 and where we have assumed that the dark - radiation term ( with the constant @xmath49 in ( [ first ] ) ) has negligible contribution .",
    "assuming regime ( [ low - energy ] ) is realized today , we can write the following minimal physical restrictions on the constants of the theory :    * brane1 : * the inequalities @xmath95 > 0\\ ] ] and @xmath96 > 0\\ ] ] give @xmath97    * brane2 : * the inequalities @xmath98 > 0\\ ] ] and @xmath99 > 0\\ ] ] imply @xmath100    from these relations , one can see that brane2 model with the asymptotic conditions ( [ low - energy ] ) , in principle , can have negative brane tension , while the tension of the brane1 model is restricted to be positive .",
    "the physical restrictions formulated above are necessary for a reasonable braneworld theory with the asymptotic limit ( [ low - energy ] ) reached today , but they are certainly far from being sufficient for the consistency of a braneworld model with all cosmological observations ( cosmic microwave background , big - bang nucleosynthesis , etc ) .",
    "this important issue , which , in fact , constitutes the main subject of investigations in the braneworld theory , clearly lies beyond the scope of the present paper and will be considered in our future publications . at the moment",
    ", one can only note that the values of the constants @xmath101 and @xmath102 in a braneworld that today evolves in regime ( [ low - energy ] ) are roughly constrained by the values of the detected cosmological constant and gravitational coupling , respectively , as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the current value of the hubble parameter , and @xmath105 is newton s constant . with these constraints",
    ", there remains a considerable freedom in the parameter space of the theory , which is to be further restricted by a more careful analysis .",
    "if condition ( [ regime ] ) is not satisfied today , then regime ( [ low - energy ] ) has not yet been reached , and one should turn to the general evolution equation ( [ first ] ) , which has a rather rich and interesting phenomenology for modeling dark energy @xcite . for example , the current acceleration of the universe expansion may be described by a braneworld model which has @xmath106 in the asymptotic expansion ( [ low - energy ] ) . according to this model , the current acceleration of the cosmological expansion is temporary , and the future evolution proceeds in a matter - dominated regime ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "another interesting example is the model of loitering braneworld @xcite , which can be realised even in the spatially flat universe .",
    "it is the negative dark radiation ( the constant @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ first ] ) ) which plays the crucial role in the dynamics of this model and which , therefore , also needs to be constrained by cosmological observations .      for @xmath107 , our equations ( [ second0 ] ) , ( [ 1st0 ] ) and ( [ w ] ) simplify to @xmath108 \\cdot \\left(\\rho + \\sigma \\right)=0\\ , , \\ ] ] @xmath109 and @xmath110\\ , , \\ ] ] respectively .    introducing the dimensionless parameters @xmath111 we can express the quantities that we used before in their terms . since only two of these parameters",

    "the natural condition @xmath118 leads to the restriction @xmath119 .",

[ f:1 ] and [ f:2 ] for the two important cases @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the shaded regions in these figures correspond to unstable static solutions ( @xmath124 ) , and the dotted regions correspond to stable static solutions ( @xmath125 ) . in general",
    ", stable static solutions exist only for the brane2 model in the case @xmath126",
    ".    it also follows from ( [ c ] ) that spatially flat static solutions with matter satisfying the strong energy condition can exist in the brane2 model with @xmath127 , i.e. , with zero dark - radiation term , in contrast with the randall  sundrum model , where spatially flat or open static solutions require negative dark - radiation term .",
    "this difference is connected with the fact that the physically admissible range of parameters in the randall  sundrum model requires positive brane tension while , in the presence of the scalar - curvature term in the action for the brane , this restriction is weakened , and negative brane tensions are also allowed . as follows from ( [ c ] ) , the condition @xmath127 is equivalent to @xmath128 , and the region with negative @xmath113 in the admissible domain of parameters allowing for this condition can be seen in fig .",

    "we extend their investigation to the case where the scalar - curvature term is also present in the action for the brane , but we restrict ourselves to the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology .      in this subsection , we briefly describe the method and results of @xcite , where the model with @xmath130 was under consideration . after setting @xmath131 , eqs .",
