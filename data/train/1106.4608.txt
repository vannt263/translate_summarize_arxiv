    "the ground state properties of a low disorder and dilute two - dimensional ( 2d ) system of charged particles are dominated by the coulomb interaction . for a 2d particle density @xmath7 ,",
    "the interaction strength is characterized by the parameter @xmath8 , the average inter - particle spacing measured in units of the effective bohr radius ( @xmath9 ) , and increases as the system is made more dilute . in fermi liquid theory , interacting particles can be treated as non - interacting quasi - particles with a re - normalized effective mass ( @xmath0 ) and spin susceptibility , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the lande g - factor . in the highly interacting ,",
    "dilute regime ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 and @xmath0 are typically enhanced compared to the band values and increase with increasing @xmath14 , as confirmed both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . besides @xmath5 , the spin and/or valley degrees of freedom also play an important role in the re - normalization of @xmath0 and @xmath13 since they modify the exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was recently demonstrated that when a 2d electron system is fully spin and valley polarized , @xmath0 is _ suppressed _ compared to its band value @xcite .",
    "this suppression was reproduced in subsequent , numerical theoretical work @xcite .    in this work we present measurements of @xmath0 in a dilute 2d _ hole _ system ( 2dhs ) confined to a ( 311)a gaas quantum well .",
    "we determine @xmath0 through analysis of the temperature dependence of the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations .",
    "while @xmath0 in gaas 2d holes has been measured via cyclotron resonance experiments @xcite , there are no reports of @xmath0 measurements in dilute 2dhss through transport experiments .",
    "the latter are useful because @xmath0 deduced from transport measurements should reflect interaction effects while , due to the kohn theorem @xcite , @xmath0 measured in cyclotron resonance experiments does not .",
    "the 2d holes in gaas differ from their 2d electron counterparts in several notable aspects .",
    "first , the band value of @xmath0 for holes is much larger than for electrons . the larger @xmath0 results in a larger @xmath5 so that one would expect the 2dhs to be a more interacting system compared to a 2d electron system at the same density .",
    "second , unlike electrons , the energy band structure of holes is nonparabolic .",
    "this is closely related to the fact that 2d holes have effective spin @xmath15 rather than @xmath16 , which is the case for electrons .",
    "third , the spin - orbit interaction resulting from the lack of inversion symmetry in gaas typically leads to a more pronounced splitting of the energy bands ( at finite wave vectors ) in the 2dhs . in an in - plane magnetic field @xmath17",
    "this is complemented by zeeman splitting that affects even the states at @xmath18 .",
    "the resulting two spin subbands , which we refer to in this paper as @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( see fig",
    ".  1 right inset ) , in general have different energy surfaces , populations , and effective masses .    in our low - density 2dhs which is confined to a nearly symmetric gaas quantum",
    "well , the spin - orbit interaction induced splitting is small and we can not experimentally resolve it . from our measurements , we find that @xmath0 has a value of @xmath21 ( in units of free electron mass , @xmath22 ) , and slightly decreases as the density is decreased . both the value of @xmath0 and its density dependence are in agreement with the results of energy band calculations which do not take interaction into account . this lack of @xmath0 enhancement relative to the results of the band calculations neglecting exchange - correlation is surprising .",
    "these results corroborate qualitatively with previous spin susceptibility measurements in 2dhss @xcite , which were also found to be close to calculated values in the absence of electron - electron interaction @xcite .",
    "while a satisfactory theoretical explanation for these observations is currently lacking , it is apparent that the holes band structure and their @xmath15 effective spin significantly alter the impact of electron - electron interaction in comparison with spin @xmath16 particles .    in our study",
    ", we also apply a large magnetic field ( @xmath23 ) parallel to the 2d plane to induce a polarization of the carriers spin and thus to separate the two spin subbands . by applying a sufficiently large field ,",
    "we are able to fully depopulate one of the spin subbands , and measure @xmath0 for the occupied subband .",
    "the measured @xmath0 is close to the value measured when @xmath24 and does not appear to be affected by the large @xmath23 which should in principle couple to the holes orbital motion and lead to an increase in @xmath0 @xcite . finally , from the value of @xmath23",
    "at which the minority spin subband is depopulated , we deduce a value for the 2d holes spin susceptibility which is about 50@xmath6 enhanced with respect to the band value .",

    "there is some enhancement of @xmath0 at large @xmath23 ( closed symbols ) with respect to the @xmath92 values ( open symbols ) , but this enhancement appears to be correlated with the increase of @xmath0 with the _ perpendicular _ component of field rather than a dependence on @xmath23 .",

    "indeed , this increase is yet significantly larger than the increase of @xmath87 one would expect for an electron system with nominally similar values of @xmath87 and @xmath11 due to the coupling of @xmath17 to the holes orbital motion @xcite . in the latter case",
    "we would expect a roughly 50@xmath6 enhancement of @xmath0 ( compared to its @xmath24 value ) . on the other hand , according to recent measurements @xcite whose results were supported by subsequent calculations @xcite , @xmath0 is @xmath94 in a 2d electron system which is fully spin polarized .",

    "<S> the measured @xmath0 is in reasonably good agreement with the results of our energy band calculations which do not take interactions into account . </S>",
    "<S> we then apply a sufficiently strong parallel magnetic field to fully depopulate one of the spin subbands , and measure @xmath0 for the populated subband . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this latter @xmath0 is close to the @xmath0 we measure in the absence of the parallel field . </S>",
    "<S> we also deduce the spin susceptibility of the 2d hole system from the depopulation field , and conclude that the susceptibility is enhanced by about 50@xmath6 relative to the value expected from the band calculations . </S>"
