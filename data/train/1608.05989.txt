    "in the case where we consider only the nearest - neighbor hopping between the @xmath2 orbitals in diamond and neglect the mixing between @xmath1 and @xmath2 orbitals , we can understand the ( anti-)alignment of the hidden orbital and spin polarization as follows .    since the last line of eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the main paper does not involve a spin index , we can interpret the hidden spin polarization in another way : suppose that @xmath23 is the orbital part of an eigenstate of the hamiltonian without spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) .",
    "then , up to first order in soc , the site - dependent spin polarization @xmath55 that @xmath23 acquires is proportional to the change in site - dependent orbital polarization @xmath81 in the system without soc when perturbed by @xmath82 , an inversion - symmetry - breaking on - site potential .",
    "if we neglect @xmath1 orbitals and focus on @xmath2 orbitals and the nearest - neighbor hopping , the hamiltonian satisfies @xmath83 for any @xmath26 ( we set the on - site energy of the @xmath2 orbitals to zero ) , where @xmath84 is a unitary operator ( recall that @xmath85 is the projection operator onto @xmath86 sublattices ) . for",
    "any @xmath26 where the band does not cross the on - site energy of the @xmath2 orbitals , let the orbital part of a state in the valence band be @xmath87 .",
    "the corresponding state in the conduction band is @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) .    now , suppose we perturb this system by @xmath91 operator . by the orthogonality of @xmath92 and that of @xmath93 , @xmath91 mixes @xmath23 only with @xmath94 and not with other four states ( i.e. , @xmath95 and @xmath96 with @xmath97 ) .",
    "therefore , the first - order correction to @xmath23 by the perturbation , @xmath98 , is proportional to @xmath94 .",
    "since the ratio between the complex amplitudes of @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 for the new eigenvector @xmath102 is still @xmath103 , the same as without perturbation , @xmath81 does not change its direction .",
    "going back to the original problem , we conclude that @xmath55 acquired by small soc is parallel or anti - parallel to the orbital polarization .    when we consider both @xmath1 and @xmath2 orbitals and the nearest - neighbor hopping among them , it is still true that the spin polarization is _ exactly _ ( anti-)parallel to the orbital polarization according to the numerical calculation , although we were not able to find an analytic proof . however , if we add next - nearest - neighbor hopping to our model , the angle between @xmath104 and @xmath55 decreases from @xmath105 ."

    "<S> [ nat . phys . * 10 * , 387 ( 2014 ) ] on local spin polarizations of bloch states in non - magnetic , centrosymmetric materials , the scope of spintronics has significantly been broadened . in this paper , we show that the corresponding quantity arising from orbital , instead of spin , degrees of freedom , the _ hidden orbital polarization _ , is ( i ) much more abundant in nature since it exists even without spin - orbit coupling and ( ii ) more fundamental since it completely determines the hidden spin polarization , by taking the most commonly known materials such as diamond , si , ge and gaas as examples . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss experimental evidences of hidden orbital polarization from photoemission spectroscopies and show that the current - induced hidden orbital polarization can play a far more important role than the spin counterpart in antiferromagnetic information technology .    </S>",
    "<S> electronic states at a given bloch wavevector in non - magnetic materials with inversion symmetry are degenerate . until recently </S>",
    "<S> , it was believed that there is no spatial spin distribution if averaged over these two spin - degenerate states . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been found that even in centrosymmetric , non - magnetic crystals , the degenerate bloch states can have local spin polarization if atoms are not at an inversion center  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> reference  @xcite reported that the lack of the local inversion symmetry at atomic sites leads to the hidden , or site - dependent spin polarization , and thus extended the scope of spintronics significantly , even to bulk materials with global inversion symmetry .    on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment of solids can be sizable ( e.g. , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and even larger than the spin contribution  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital magnetization becomes more important in some physical phenomena , e.g. , the current - induced magnetization  @xcite and the gyrotropic magnetic effect  @xcite , than the spin magnetization if spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is weak . </S>",
    "<S> also , the important role of orbital polarization in rashba - split bands  @xcite and in quantum anomalous hall phases  @xcite of systems without inversion symmetry has been discussed .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we report the finding that hidden , or sublattice - dependent , orbital polarization of bloch states of centrosymmetric materials can be large ( of the order of @xmath0 ) even without soc by taking the simplest , best - known materials , such as diamond , si , and ge , as examples . </S>",
    "<S> we describe that , in any non - magnetic centrosymmetric materials , the hidden spin polarization is completely determined by the hidden orbital polarization . </S>",
    "<S> this finding , together with the fact that in materials with weak soc the hidden spin polarization is small or absent , suggests that the hidden orbital polarization is a more fundamental quantity to be explored . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the sublattice - dependent spin - orbital texture of centrosymmetric systems is qualitatively different from that of non - centrosymmetric ones and that the hidden orbital polarization can play an important role in current - induced magnetizations  @xcite not only of centrosymmetric materials but also of non - centrosymmetric materials such as gaas . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss the experimental evidences in photoemission spectroscopies and technological implications of our findings in antiferromagnetic information technology using current - induced hidden orbital polarization which , according to our calculation , could be much more important than its spin counterpart .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the electronic structures of diamond , si , ge and gaas , using a tight - binding model including atomic @xmath1 and @xmath2 orbitals ( @xmath3 model )  @xcite and the on - site spin - orbit coupling term @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the two sublattices in zinc - blende structure [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ] , and the local orbital angular momentum operator @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) for each sublattice is defined as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the levi - civita symbol and @xmath11 is the bloch sum of @xmath12 orbitals at sublattice @xmath13 . </S>",

    "<S> first , we discuss the orbital polarization of diamond , whose soc is negligible . if soc is neglected , the spin - up and -down states have the same energy and orbital wavefunction . figure 1(b ) shows the local orbital polarization @xmath22 for the orbital part of a bloch state , @xmath23 , corresponding to p in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the product of the inversion operator ( @xmath24 ) and the time reversal operator ( @xmath25 ) conserves the crystal momentum @xmath26 , all the bloch states are invariant under @xmath27 operation if we neglect spin . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are exchanged by @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the local orbital polarizations at @xmath5 and @xmath6 are of the same magnitude and are antiparallel to each other , i.e. , if we define @xmath28 , @xmath29 .    figures  1(c)-1(f ) show @xmath30 for the two topmost valence bands of diamond , which is of the order of @xmath0 except on some symmetry lines . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the orbital polarization on each sublattice of a centrosymmetric material can be large . in @xmath31 plane , </S>",
    "<S> since * k * is invariant under @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the operator for 180@xmath34 rotation with respect to the @xmath35 axis , @xmath30 lies in the @xmath36 plane . </S>",
    "<S> we also checked that si and ge have similar hidden orbital polarization textures  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> now we show that in centrosymmetric materials without magnetism , the hidden spin polarization is a physical quantity that is completely determined by the hidden orbital polarization . </S>",
    "<S> first , when soc is absent , it is obvious that a hidden spin texture can not exist in these materials : since the potential an electron feels does not depend on the spin , all bands are spin - degenerate and each bloch state can not have spatially inhomogeneous spin distribution . </S>",
    "<S> ( on the other hand , we showed that there can be large hidden orbital polarization even when soc is absent . ) when there is soc , the spin - up and spin - down bands mix with each other , but they are still degenerate due to @xmath27 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we define the spin or orbital polarization of each band as the average of the expectation values of the two degenerate states  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath37 be spin - degenerate eigenstates of the hamiltonian without soc , where @xmath23 is the orbital part and @xmath38 is the spin part . in our model where the soc is given by @xmath39 , we can express the local spin polarization @xmath40 in terms of the matrix element of orbital angular momentum operators , using first order perturbation theory :    @xmath41    here , @xmath42 is the projection operator onto sublattice @xmath13 , @xmath43 is the pauli spin matrix , and @xmath44 is the energy of the state @xmath23 when soc is absent . in the third equality of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : s ] ) we have used @xmath45^ * = \\bigl\\langle n\\mathbf{k } \\bigl| p^a \\bigl| m\\mathbf{k } \\bigl\\rangle \\bigl\\langle m\\mathbf{k } \\bigl| \\mathbf{l}^a \\bigl| n\\mathbf{k } \\bigl\\rangle$ ] , which follows from ( i ) @xmath46 , ( ii ) @xmath47 , ( iii ) @xmath48 if @xmath49 , and ( iv ) @xmath50 is equal to @xmath23 up to a phase factor ( recall that @xmath23 is the orbital part of the wavefunction ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus calculate the hidden spin polarization from the hidden orbital polarization using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : s ] ) , which is one of our key results .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that it is straightforward to extend eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : s ] ) and calculate higher - order terms in a regime where soc is not small , and even in this regime , it is still true that the hidden orbital polarization determines the hidden spin polarization . </S>",
    "<S> also , eq .  ( [ eq : s ] ) can straightforwardly be extended to materials having more than two atoms per unit cell or to cases involving @xmath51 or higher-@xmath52 orbitals  @xcite .    ) at sublattice _ a _ of the bloch states of diamond obtained by using @xmath53  mev ( the physical value for diamond ) and @xmath54  ev . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure  2 shows @xmath55 of two topmost valence bands of diamond , calculated by direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian [ rather than using eq .  </S>",

    "<S> 2(a ) and  2(b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> quite surprisingly , even if we set the soc strength @xmath57 to 1  ev , which is 250 times the physical value , the hidden spin polarization is still an order - of - magnitude smaller than the orbital one [ figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) and  2(d ) ] because in diamond @xmath5 and @xmath6 sublattices are strongly coupled to each other . </S>",
    "<S> however , in some centrosymmetric materials hidden spin polarization can be nearly fully polarized  @xcite ; even in this case our claim that the orbital polarization determines the spin polarization is valid . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that the hidden spin polarization shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : s ] ) holds for a wide range of soc strength , i.e. , up to @xmath58 .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the directions of spin and orbital polarizations are exactly opposite to each other ( fig .  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to find a simple reason for this ( anti-)alignment , because eq .  ( </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : s ] ) expresses the hidden spin polarization in terms of the off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath59 , rather than the diagonal ones . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can understand this behavior in some restricted cases  @xcite .    ) of the two bands of gaas </S>",
    "<S> split from the spin - degenerate bands with @xmath60 when soc is absent . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) and ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) , and ( e ) and ( f ) show the quantities for the upper spin - split band , those for the lower spin - split band , and their averages , respectively . ]    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have discussed the hidden spin and orbital polarizations of centrosymmetric materials . </S>",
    "<S> the spin texture in non - centrosymmetric materials is qualitatively different from that in centrosymmetric systems . without soc , </S>",
    "<S> all electronic energy bands of a non - magnetic material are spin - degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to centrosymmetric systems where soc mixes spin - up and spin - down components without lifting the degeneracy , the soc in non - centrosymmetric systems lifts this degeneracy .    </S>",
    "<S> figures  3(a - d ) show the spin - orbital texture ( @xmath31 ) of the two bands of gaas split from the second - topmost , spin - degenerate valence bands when soc is absent </S>",
    "<S> . the orbital polarization of as atoms is around twice as large as that of ga atoms , which can be attributed to the lower on - site potential energy of as atoms . </S>",
    "<S> their directions are opposite to each other , similarly to the hidden orbital polarizations at @xmath5 and @xmath6 in diamond ( figs .  1 and  2 ) .    comparing the upper spin - split band [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a - b ) ] and the lower spin - split band [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c - d ) ] , we note that , except near @xmath61 or @xmath62 axis , the orbital polarizations of the upper and lower bands are nearly the same because soc mixes only the spin - up and -down bands : its magnitude is smaller than the energy distance from those bands to other adjacent bands .    </S>",
    "<S> the spin texture of gaas in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 shows the following features : ( i ) excluding the regions near @xmath63 or @xmath64 where four bands are degenerate if soc is absent , the spin polarization is parallel or anti - parallel to the orbital polarization . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the spin polarization at ga atoms and that at as atoms of each spin - split band are parallel to each other , which contrasts with the hidden spin polarization in diamond , i.e. , @xmath55 and @xmath65 are anti - parallel to each other . ( </S>",
    "<S> iii ) the spin is almost fully polarized in each band .    </S>",
    "<S> these features can be explained as follows . </S>",
    "<S> when soc is ignored , the spin - up and -down bands are degenerate and share the common orbital wavefunction , @xmath66 . within degenerate - state perturbation theory , </S>",
    "<S> the effect of soc is described by diagonalizing @xmath67 in the two - dimensional hilbert space spanned by the spin - up and spin - down states . </S>",
    "<S> ( we set @xmath68  ev and @xmath69  ev  @xcite . ) therefore , if there is no other degeneracy , the direction of the spin polarization of one spin - split band is parallel to @xmath70 \\bigl| n\\mathbf{k } \\bigl\\rangle$ ] ( which we will denote as @xmath71 ) and the spin polarization of the other spin - split band points to the opposite direction . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath72 and @xmath73 as the spinors whose spin quantization axes are parallel to and antiparallel to @xmath71 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> then , the wavefunctions of the spin - split bands are @xmath74 and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the spin is nearly fully polarized in each spin - split band and the spin polarizations at ga atoms and at as atoms are parallel to each other .    </S>",
    "<S> we can further understand the direction of the spin polarization of each spin - split band . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath76 is anti - parallel to @xmath77 and both the orbital polarization and the atomic soc of as is larger than those of ga , @xmath71 is parallel to @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the spin of the electronic states in the upper spin - split band , at both sublattices , aligns with @xmath77 and that in the lower spin - split band anti - aligns with @xmath77 ( fig .  3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is contrary to the hidden spin polarization in centrosymmetric materials , where the spin polarizations at the two sublattices are opposite to each other .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in gaas or any other non - centrosymmetric materials , if we decrease the strength of soc , the spin polarization of a spin - split band does not change much because the eigenvectors of the full hamiltonian are independent of the scaling of the spin - orbit interaction hamiltonian in small soc limit . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is contrary to the case of the hidden spin polarization in centrosymmetric materials , whose magnitude scales linearly with the strength of soc in the same limit [ eq .  ( [ eq : s ] ) and </S>",
    "<S> fig .  2 ] .    despite the fact that gaas lacks inversion symmetry , transport properties </S>",
    "<S> are effectively determined by the average of the spin - split bands depending on the level of impurity and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , @xmath78 luttinger model  @xcite is commonly adopted in studying transport properties of gaas ( e.g. , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> although each spin - split band of gaas is nearly fully spin - polarized [ figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(a)-3(d ) ] , when we average the spin polarization over the two spin - split bands , the spin polarization is very much reduced , whereas the orbital polarization is almost invariant upon averaging [ figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(e ) and  3(f ) ] . in this regard , the averaged spin and orbital polarizations at , say , as atoms [ figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(f ) ] are similar to the hidden spin and orbital polarizations at sublattice @xmath5 in diamond [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) ] even in case we use huge soc of @xmath79  ev [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(d ) ] : in all cases , the averaged or hidden spin polarization is much smaller in magnitude than the averaged or hidden orbital polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that site - dependent orbital polarizations are important in current - induced magnetizations  @xcite of _ both _ centrosymmetric and non - centrosymmetric materials . </S>",
    "<S> recently , spin - polarized photocurrents were measured from bulk wse@xmath80  @xcite , a non - magnetic centrosymmetric material . </S>",
    "<S> the results confirm the hidden spin polarization and the hidden orbital polarization since the former is generated from the latter . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the hidden orbital polarization in materials with small soc can also be observed even by measuring the spin - integrated photocurrents because it is not the spin polarization but the orbital polarization that determines the coupling between electrons and photons . </S>",
    "<S> provided that the final state is well approximated by @xmath1-like states , the hidden orbital polarization manifests itself also in the circular dichroism of a non - magnetic , centrosymmetric material .    </S>",
    "<S> now we discuss technological implications of our findings . </S>",
    "<S> when an electric current is applied to a centrosymmetric material , the non - equilibrium , site - dependent orbital and spin magnetizations arise . </S>",
    "<S> the current - induced magnetization is antiferromagnetic , owing to the nature of the hidden orbital and spin polarizations , and its direction depends on the direction of the current  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> antiferromagnetic spintronic devices , in which a current generates sublattice - dependent spin - orbit torques and changes the magnetic state of a material , have several advantages over the conventional spintronic devices based on ferromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> since the total magnetic moment of an antiferromagnet is zero , antiferromagnetic devices are largely insensitive to the external environment and do not introduce unnecessary magnetic crosstalks . </S>",
    "<S> also , they operate much faster than ferromagnetic devices  @xcite . the concept of hidden orbital polarization established here should be taken into account in properly predicting the site - dependent magnetism because , as we have shown , the spin polarization of a bloch state could be much smaller than the orbital polarization in many materials [ e.g. , see fig .  2 and figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(e ) and  3(f ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , even in materials with weak soc , the hidden orbital polarization can be used in antiferromagnetic information storage and processing because of the exchange interactions between localized , hidden orbital moments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important and promising future research direction , for both theory and experiment , is the investigation of antiferromagnetic information storage and processing in this regard .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that even in centrosymmetric , non - magnetic materials , there can be large site - dependent , hidden orbital polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> especially , in centrosymmetric group iv materials such as diamond , si , and ge , the hidden spin polarization is tiny , whereas the hidden orbital polarization is of the order of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also found that the hidden spin polarization is completely determined by the hidden orbital polarization in general centrosymmetric , non - magnetic materials . </S>",
    "<S> our study illustrates that site - dependent orbital polarizations play an important role in current - induced magnetizations not only of centrosymmetric materials but also of non - centrosymmetric materials such as gaas . </S>",
    "<S> we have discussed the experimental signatures of the hidden orbital polarization in centrosymmetric materials in both spin - resolved and -integrated photoemission spectroscopies and implications in antiferromagnetic information technology . because there are more degrees of freedom in orbital polarization than in spin polarization , the hidden orbital polarization may lead to richer physics .    </S>",
