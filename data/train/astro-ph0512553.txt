    "in @xcite the authors make some comments about their previous work @xcite and also reply to certain issues that have been raised by some authors @xcite concerning the nature of the matter distribution and the asymptotic behaviour of the spacetime in their model . in particular , @xcite pointed out that the use of a @xmath1 function in the solution of the field equations introduces an additional disk on the @xmath0 plane and later @xcite showed that the disk was made of exotic matter . consequently , @xcite examine the question in several ways and present some arguments to dismiss the existence of a physical mass layer present on the @xmath0 plane .",
    "we would like to notice some inconsistencies in their paper .",
    "the first is related to the expressions used for the surface density of the singular disk , and is presented in sec .  [ sec_disk ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec_smooth ] we question the smoothing procedure discussed in section 4 of @xcite . we find that one can not eliminate disk singularities , moreover one introduces new singularities that make the model unrealistic .",
    "in @xcite we calculate the distributional energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 due to the introduction of an absolute value of @xmath3 in the metric functions .",
    "the resulting non - zero components read @xcite    @xmath4    where all quantities are evaluated on @xmath0 . since @xmath2 is non - diagonal , in order to have obtain the physical variables of the disk , we need to put the energy - momentum tensor in its canonical form . to do that we solve the eigenvalue problem : @xmath5 .",
    "we thus find @xmath6 and using eq .",
    "( [ eq_qtt])([eq_qphiphi ] ) result in @xmath7 as the discriminant is always negative , the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions are complex conjugate .",
    "if @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the timelike and spacelike real eigenvectors , the canonical form of the energy - momentum tensor is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the surface density , @xmath12 denote the azimuthal stresses and @xmath13 is the heat flow in the azimuthal direction @xcite . thus the expression for the surface density , to order @xmath14 , is given by @xmath15 , or , using the relation @xmath16 we get @xmath17    on the other hand , @xcite take following expressions for the surface energy density ( equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) of the paper ) @xmath18 which they integrate over the surface and compare with the volume integral of their continuous mass density distributions .",
    "but eq .  ( [ eq_sigma2 ] ) is only the @xmath19 component eq .",
    "( [ eq_qtt ] ) to order @xmath14 . due to the non - diagonal form of the energy - momentum tensor",
    ", the @xmath19 component solely does not determine the surface density , but there is also a contribution from the @xmath20 component eq .",
    "( [ eq_qphiphi ] ) _ even to order _ @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the correct expression for @xmath21 that should be used is eq .",
    "( [ eq_sigma ] ) .",
    "the integration of this equation over the surface would result in half of the value for the mass derived from the volume integral of the continuous mass distribution , since the authors themselves comment on footnote 7 that the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq_sigma2 ] ) contribute equally .",
    "it is important to stress that the physical variables of the mass layer on the @xmath0 plane are not directly given by the principal diagonal terms of the distributional energy - momentum tensor , since the non - diagonal terms are non - negligible .",
    "this is further an example of how the non - linearity of general relativity can manifest even at newtonian level .",
    "another approach used in @xcite to examine the presence of a singular mass layer on the symmetry plane was to smooth the solution over an interval that includes the @xmath0 plane .",
    "this was achieved by the choice of @xmath22 functions to span the symmetry plane in the interval @xmath23 . for @xmath24 ,",
    "the original solution with exponentials was used .",
    "this requires that the functions @xmath25 _ and _ also @xmath26 match at @xmath27",
    ". if this last condition is not satisfied new matter is added .",
    "we note that this is also true for the newtonian gravitational potential , discontinuity of the first derivatives `` add matter '' whose density can be computed via poisson s equation .",
    "we argue that the above mentioned matching can not be done without adding new matter .        and impose the conditions @xmath29 and @xmath30 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq_n1])([eq_n2 ] ) we obtain @xmath31=0 , \\label{eq_match1}\\\\ & \\sum_n k_n^2rj_1(k_nr ) \\left [ -c_{2n}\\sinh(k_nz_0)-c_{1n}e^{-k_nz_0 } \\right]=0 . \\label{eq_match2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the bessel functions are linearly independent , the terms in brackets must vanish identically",
    ". subtracting eq .",
    "( [ eq_match1 ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ eq_match2 ] ) results in @xmath32 , which is only satisfied in the real domain if all @xmath33 .",
    "thus it is not possible to match @xmath25 and @xmath26 simultaneously .",
    "if we demand continuity of @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 at @xmath27 we obtain the following conditions : @xmath37 on the other hand , demanding continuity of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 at @xmath27 results in @xmath41 fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) sketches what happens if we impose continuity of the functions and fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) if we impose continuity of the derivatives .",
    "the only way the functions eq .  ( [ eq_n1])([eq_n3 ] ) _ and _ their derivatives could be matched is if an extra set of constants were inserted into eq .",
    "( [ eq_n2 ] ) @xmath42 but then this would not be a solution of @xmath43    assuming conditions eq .",
    "( [ eq_cond ] ) hold , the jump of the derivatives of eq .",
    "( [ eq_n1])([eq_n3 ] ) with respect to @xmath3 evaluated at @xmath27 are given by @xmath44 the same kind of descontinuities in the derivatives also appear when a @xmath1 is introduced in the solution .",
    "thus they introduce additional layers of matter now located on the @xmath45 planes that makes the solution unrealistic .      9 f. i. cooperstock and s. tieu , preprint : astro - ph/0512048 . f. i. cooperstock and s. tieu , preprint : astro - ph/0507619 .",
