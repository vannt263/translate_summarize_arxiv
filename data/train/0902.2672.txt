    "the friedmann - lematre cosmological model @xcite , described by the robertson - walker geometry @xcite with classical electrodynamics as its source , leads to a singularity at a finite time in the past @xcite .",
    "it is usually identified as the origin of the universe .",
    "in fact , this singular behavior points out that , around the very beginning , the spacetime curvature becomes arbitrarily large , thus being beyond the domain of applicability of the model .",
    "it is expected that a quantum theory for gravity would circumvent the appearance of this curvature singularity by changing the predictions of the general relativity in the limit of large curvature .",
    "there are many proposals of cosmological solutions without a primordial singularity .",
    "mostly they are based on the fact that a collapsing phase can achieve a minimum , then evolving into a expanding phase .",
    "these nonsingular solutions are usually called bouncing cosmology .",
    "such models are based on a variety of distinct mechanisms , such as cosmological constant @xcite , non - minimal couplings @xcite , nonlinear lagrangians involving quadratic terms in the curvature @xcite , non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite and loop quantum cosmology @xcite , among others @xcite . in general , the singularity theorems @xcite are circumvented by the appearance of a high ( but nevertheless finite ) negative pressure in the early phase of the universe .",
    "an initial singularity can also be avoided by assuming a quantum creation of a small but finite universe , and hence a beginning of time @xcite .",

    "data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observations @xcite have imposed several restrictions to the possible models describing an inflationary cosmology .",
    "particularly , evidence @xcite for primordial non - gaussianity in the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) seems to disfavor canonical single - field slow - roll inflation .",
    "further , the spatial curvature of the universe is found to be small ( with an spatial curvature parameter @xmath0 of order @xmath1 ) , but not so small as predicted by the conventional inflationary models , where @xmath2 .",
    "wmap data seem to favor cosmological models with flat ( euclidean ) or open ( negative curvature ) spatial sections .",
    "if the spatial curvature is non null , even being small , the implications for the time evolution of the universe can really be important , as described by general relativity .",
    "recently @xcite , inflationary cosmology and late - time accelerated expansion of the universe were considered in the context of non - minimally coupled effective yang - mills ( y - m ) fields .",
    "it was shown that y - m fields with a non - minimal gravitational coupling can produce an accelerated expanding phase in a flat ( euclidean spatial section ) universe model .",
    "a complete analysis of the consequences for cosmology of the minimal coupling between gravity and effective y - m fields has not been considered so far in the literature .",
    "the issue of inflation appears also in the context of nonsingular quantum cosmological models @xcite , where the inflationary phase appears as a quantum cosmological effect , instead of being produced by an inflaton field .    in this paper ,",
    "the cosmological consequences of the minimal coupling between gravity and effective y - m theory are investigated .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor coming from the effective y - m fields is assumed to be the dominant source of the matter - energy content of the early universe , which is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the behavior of all possible solutions is examined for the three distinct topologies , corresponding to flat , closed ( positive curvature ) and open ( negative curvature ) spatial sections .",
    "it is shown that when euclidean or closed sections are considered , the solutions presenting expansion are decelerated and evolve into a static configuration . from this static phase the system can evolve into a collapsing phase if fluctuations on the scale factor are allowed . on the other hand , solutions corresponding to an open model do allow the universe to evolve into an accelerated expansion , thus providing a simple mechanism for an early inflationary phase produced by a vector field .",
    "models presenting an inflationary phase produced by vector fields have been called as dark energy models @xcite . a graceful exit from the inflationary phase",
    "appears naturally because of a relationship between the scale factor and the magnitude of the y - m field .",
    "further , depending on the value of some parameters that characterize the system , the solutions turn out to be singular or nonsingular .",

    "it is worth to stress that , considering the assumed framework , solutions presenting accelerated expansion only appear in an open universe model .",
    "thus , it provides a possible mechanism for an early inflationary phase produced by a vector field .",
    "the solutions can be singular or nonsingular , depending on the initial conditions and also on the values that the physical parameters can take .",
    "let us pick up a specific application of the results obtained in this manuscript .",
    "let us take , for instance , a nonsingular expanding solution from the open - section model with the matter fields described by the y - m lagrangian density in the regime of small coupling with large mean fields [ as described in section [ vc3 ] , with the parameters @xmath134 and @xmath135 given by eqs .",
    "( [ 69 ] ) and ( [ 70 ] ) ] . in this case",
    "the universe would come from a previous decelerated contracting phase , which is a solution coming from the negative root of eq .",
    "( [ 52 ] ) , and after achieving a minimum volume , determined by @xmath173 , would expand in an accelerated rate . during this expanding phase",
    "the strong energy dominance condition is violated and , mathematically , the accelerated phase would last forever .",
    "nevertheless , eq . ( [ 34 ] ) shows that as @xmath19 increases , @xmath214 decreases .",
    "thus , the system may achieve a phase in which the regime of large mean - fields does not apply .",
    "this fact shows that a mechanism for a graceful exit is supported by this framework .",
    "in fact , when @xmath40 approaches the value @xmath215 , the dominant term in the effective lagrangian would be maxwell - like .",
    "this is formally equivalent to neglect the second term in eq .",
    "( [ 47 ] ) , which would lead to a phase of decelerated expansion . in this sense ,",
    "a inflationary phase of a nonsingular homogeneous and isotropic universe with a graceful exit appears naturally in the minimal coupled yang - mills fields in an open flrw cosmology .",
    "matematically , as consequence of considering y - m matter field as the dominant energy contents , all the accelerated phases described in the open section models last forever .",
    "however , as suggested above , these solutions should be considered only as describing an early phase of the universe . as the universe expands the plasma",
    "is expected to evolve into another form of matter , which would dominate a next phase of the evolution . in this case , a complete scenario should consider the transition between this primordial phase to the next one , as radiation for example . in the case of a singular and accelerated expanding model ( as presented in section [ vc1 ] ) the amount of inflation is a quantity of interest to be derived .",
    "this quantity can be obtained as @xmath216 $ ] where @xmath217 and @xmath218 represent the time coordinate at the end and at the begin of the inflation phase , respectively . denoting the critical value of the magnetic field by @xmath219 ,",
    "bellow which radiation would be the dominant form of matter , we obtain @xmath220 .",
    "closing , few remarks are in order .",
    "first , the results obtained in this manuscript presenting inflationary solutions only occur in models with open spatial section .",
    "inflationary models obtained from non - minimal y - m theory have been considered only for flat spatial section @xcite .",
    "one important feature of the solutions presenting an inflationary phase in the minimal coupling is that such phases can also appear in the context of nonsingular models .",
    "thus , in such cases the amount of inflation is not a fundamental aspect to be considered in the solution of the initial conditions problems stated by standard cosmology .",
    "the motivation to work with models with non - flat spatial sections may be set by further observations from wmap and planck projects .",
    "it should be stressed that the spatial curvature has currently been found to be small but not necessarily zero , and the consequences of a non - zero curvature ( even really small ) can be relevant in the evolution of the universe , as shown here .",
    "second , all the solutions presenting accelerated phases obtained in the context of miminal y - m theory may be naturally obtained as limiting cases from non - minimal couplings with an open spatial section .",
    "therefore , if non - flat models is considered in non - minimal coupling cases our results should be recovered in the corresponding regime .",
    "finally , the anisotropies in cmb found in current data indicates that the early phase of the universe was not perfectly smooth .",
    "this fact must be connected with the inhomogeneities in the distribution of galaxies on large scales , as measured by two degree field galaxy redshift survey @xcite .",
    "the very relationship between large scale structure and cmb is still an exciting issue in cosmology . in order to apply the results obtained here in the understanding of structure formation",
    ", the perturbations around the smooth background should be considered for each particular solution . in this context",
    "the power spectrum in the fourier space would be the most important statistic .",
    "in the context of the solutions presented in this manuscript , two different situations could occur .",
    "if singular models are considered , inflation would be the responsible for the generation of scalar and tensor perturbations . by the other hand ,",
    "if nonsingular models are considered , the primordial perturbations could possibly be produced in a previous contracting phase , thus evolving into the expanding phase by means of the bounce .",
    "the derivation of the perturbed einstein equations in the context of minimal y - m theory and its application in the study of the above mentioned aspects deserve future investigation .",
