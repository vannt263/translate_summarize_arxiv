    "the langmuir probe is one of the simplest diagnostics tools of the study of ionized gases .",
    "the probe usually consists of a small sphere or a circular cylinder which is placed in the plasma at the point of interest .",
    "some external circuitry is provided so that the electric potential of the probe can be varied . a plot of the total current flowing between the probe and the plasma versus the probe potential",
    "is called the current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristic .",
    "langmuir probes are highly effective in determining the electron energy distribution function ( eedf ) , allowing both spatial and temporal resolution .",
    "the eedf is given by the second derivative of the probe i - v characteristic .",
    "in recent years , several groups have successfully used the numerical differentiation of digital probe trace data .",
    "@xcite . yet ,",
    "numerically , the second derivative is a hard task and is classified as an ill - posed problem .",
    "ill - posed problems do not have the properties of existence , uniqueness and stability @xcite .",
    "one of the alternatives to solve this problem is the introduction of the concept of conditional well - posed problems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the problem of integration of the i - v characteristic has evolved along with the solution of the fredholm integral equation of first class , which is obtained from the integration of a second order differential equation .",
    "one of the most stable methods to solve the fredholm integral equation are the regularization methods .    in order to characterize the processes occurring in plasmas",
    "it is advisable to obtain the electron energy distribution function with a high degree of accuracy . in particular , there has been much interest in the electron cyclotron resonance ( ecr ) plasma sources motivated by their applications in ionized physical vapor deposition techniques ( i - pvd ) @xcite .    in this paper , the second derivative of a langmuir probe current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristic is numerically integrated using the tikhonov singular value decomposition ( svd ) regularized method in order to establish the eedf as the most stable method .",
    "the existence of two groups of electrons with different temperatures , where low pressure plasma is sustained by electron impact ionization of the ground state molecules or atoms by energetic electrons arising in the resonance zone is shown .",
    "also , it is important to notice that the rate of convergence of the tikhonov method is much faster than that achieved with the least - squares with an orthogonal decomposition ( lsqr ) and truncated singular value decomposition ( tsdv ) methods . a comparison between the eedf obtained by the tikhonov regularization method and the one resulting from a least - squares fitting is discussed .",
    "the electric potential profile near the probe can influence its current collection by setting up `` barriers of effective potential '' around the probe , thereby preventing some particles from reaching it .",
    "this profile can be strongly influenced by the space charge of the particles themselves .",
    "however , when @xmath0 is small enough ( the sheath around the probe is comparatively thick ) , this barriers disappears , and the current collection is maximized .",
    "the currents collected under these conditions then become the orbit - limited - currents .",
    "this assumption is backed by the orbital motion limit ( oml ) theory @xcite which implies a thick , collisionless sheath ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "thus , the calculation of laframboise @xcite , based on the more complete theory of berstein and rabinowitz @xcite , showed that the oml limit is achived for @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the probe radius ( spherical or cylindrical ) , @xmath4 is the debye radius , and @xmath5 is the electron mean free path , respectively .",
    "when we assume the presence of a stopping field ( @xmath6 ) , as demonstrated by druyvesteyn in @xcite , the second derivative of the current @xmath7 with respect to the voltage @xmath8 of the probe is proportional to the electron energy distribution function as follows @xmath9 where the energy is @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the probe voltage , @xmath12 is the plasma potential , @xmath7 is the electron current to the probe , @xmath13 is the probe surface area , and @xmath14 @xmath15 are the electron mass and charge , respectively .",
    "the contribution of the ion current to the second derivative of the probe current is normally insignificant , and it is therefore not subtracted in these eedf calculations .",
    "the equation ( [ 1 ] ) is in the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a function of the potential on the probe @xmath11 with the boundary conditions for the current given by @xmath18 a double integration in @xmath11 of equation ( [ 2 ] ) results in @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and , @xmath21 + \\frac{1}{b - a}\\left[bi(a ) - ai(b)\\right ] .",
    "\\label{6}\\ ] ] this integral equation is known as the fredholm equation of first class and it can be solved numerically by regularization methods . the galerkin discretization becomes the more efficient scheme for this class of problems @xcite .",
    "in order to solve the fredholm s first class equation ( [ 4 ] ) , the kernel @xmath22 can be expressed in the form of an expansion in terms of singular functions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and singular values @xmath25 : @xmath26 in the occurrence of symmetry , this reduces itself to an eigenfunction expansion .",
    "it is not necessary that the expansion should converge pointwise ; all we require for an @xmath27 kernel is that @xmath28 for which it is necessary and sufficient that the series @xmath29 converge .",

    "the solution of the system ( [ 4 ] ) proposed by tikhonov consists in replacing the ill - posed problem with a stable minimization problem involving a small positive parameter @xmath46 : instead of attempting to solve the equation ( [ 4 ] ) directly , we seek to minimize the quadratic functional @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is some linear operator and @xmath49 denotes @xmath50 . if @xmath48 is suitably chosen , then the second term has a smoothing or stabilizing effect on the solution .",
    "we may , for example , take @xmath51 , or @xmath52 ; if the @xmath53 derivative is selected , the process is termed @xmath53 order regularization . in the case",
    "@xmath54 , the solution of the minimization problem ( [ 10 ] ) is then obtained as the solution of the linear equation @xmath55 the operator acting on @xmath56 is clearly positive - definite when @xmath57 and consequently it has a bounded inverse . solving in terms of singular functions",
    "we obtain @xmath58 comparing this with the exact expansion we can see that the effect of regularization has been to insert a filter factor @xmath59 . this is close to unity so long as @xmath25 is large compared with @xmath46 but tends to zero as @xmath60 , the rate of transition depending on @xmath46 . if we split @xmath49 into @xmath61 the expression ( [ 11 ] ) becomes @xmath62 as for the first term , it is advantageous to make @xmath46 small in order to reduce the error due to regularization ; by contrast , the second term , which only consists of error , is made small by taking @xmath46 large .",

    "in the oml theory of ion collection , the ion current flowing to a negatively biased probe is independent of the shape of the plasma potential @xmath75 as long as the current is limited only by the angular momentum of the orbiting ions @xcite .",
