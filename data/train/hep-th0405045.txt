    "the four - dimensional schwarzschild black hole in einstein gravity is well - known to be stable classically under linearized perturbations chan:83 .",
    "recently , it has been shown that this extends to hold for higher dimensional cases ishi:03 .",
    "however , gregory and laflamme discovered that the black strings and @xmath1-branes of 10-d low energy string theory , which have _ hypercylindrical _ horizons @xmath3 instead of compact _ hyperspherical _ ones @xmath4 , are found to be unstable as the compactification scale , say @xmath5 , of extended directions becomes larger than the order of the horizon radius @xmath6the so - called gregory - laflamme ( gl ) instability greg:93 . in gl s original work",
    ", they explained the instability by arguing that a black string @xmath7 has a lower entropy than a 5-d schwarzschild black hole @xmath8 with the same total mass when @xmath9 , in the context of microcanonical ensemble ; pair annihilations , is also known though it gives only the order of magnitudes dani:01 . ] and they also argued that this lend support to the horizon fragmentation , which would produce array of black holes eventually .",
    "however , it is widely believed that this entropy argument for the classical stability should not be taken seriously since it @xmath10 a wrong onset point of the instability  this means the black string can be classically stable even if its entropy is smaller than that of 5-d schwarzschild black hole for some regime of @xmath5though it provides some plausibility argument gubs:00,real:01,hira:01,hube:02 .",
    "moreover , the gl s fragmentation scenario was disproved under very weak assumptions , including the @xmath11 black hole area theorem , by horowitz and maeda ( hm ) and a non - uniform black string as the final state of the gl instability horo:01 is considered accordingly .    in this paper",
    ", i will show that this widespread belief is @xmath12 @xmath13 correct : if one properly apply the entropy argument to the black string solution @xmath14 of 10-d low energy string theory , one can estimate the onset point of the gl instability up to 2.4 % discrepancy . for @xmath1-brane solutions ,",
    "the thing depends on the geometry of the compactification of @xmath1-branes .",
    "i consider two typical methods of compactifications : thin - torus compactification and @xmath1-dimensional isotropic - torus compactification .",
    "for the former case , the discrepancy grows as @xmath1 grows ( @xmath15 decreases ) up to 35 % discrepancy for @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "but , for the latter case , the discrepancy is quite reduced up to @xmath18 .",
    "this may provide a strong support to the gl s horizon fragmentation , which would produce the array of higher - dimensional schwarzschild - type s black holes finally . on the other hand ,",
    "another estimator for the size of the black hole end - state relative to the compact dimension indicates a second order ( i.e. , smooth ) phase transition for some @xmath2 appropriate compactifications and total dimension of spacetime wherein the entropy argument is not appropriate : for the black strings @xmath19 , this occurs for @xmath15 as large as @xmath20 and for the ( isotropic ) black @xmath1-branes @xmath21 , this occurs for @xmath15 as low as @xmath22 with a fixed total dimension of spacetime @xmath23 . in this case",
    ", hm - type s non - uniform black strings or @xmath1-branes can be the final state of the gl instability instead .",
    "the black string and @xmath1-branes i am specifically interested in are those introduced by horowitz and strominger horo:91 in 10-d low energy string theory with a metric given by    ds^2=-n^2 dt^2 + n^-2 dr^2 + r^2 d _",
    "n-2 ^ 2 + dx^i dx_i ,    where    n^2=1 - 16 g m_(n)(n-2 ) _",
    "n-2r^n-3 ,    @xmath24 and index @xmath25 runs from 1 to @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the mass of the @xmath15-dimensional black holes , and @xmath28 is the area of the unit sphere @xmath29 myer:86 .",
    "this is always a solution of the einstein equation in @xmath30 dimensions for compact as well as non - compact string or brane directions if the string or brane directions are completely factorized .",
    "but , this particular solution does not exist for @xmath31-brane ( i.e. , 10-d black hole ) and we must consider deformations of ordinary schwarzschild solution due to non - compact dimensions in general hube:02,horo:96,myer:87 .",
    "but , let me approximate the 10-d black hole by the ordinary @xmath32 metric , with 10-d radial coordinate @xmath33 .",
    "in order to compute the transition point between the black strings or branes and the 10-d black hole of the same mass due to the entropy difference , in the context of microcanonical ensemble , we need to know details of compactified dimensions . in this section",
    "let me first consider the simplest one , black string and consider simply a @xmath34-compactification . to this end , let me note that the masses and entropies of the black string and the 10-d black hole , with the horizon radii @xmath6 and @xmath35 , are , respectively    & & m_b.s.=7 ^3 r_+ l48 g ,   s_b.s.=^4 r_+^7 l12 g , + & & m_b.h.(10)=16 ^3 r_+^7 105 g ,   s_b.h.(10)=8 ^4 r_+^8 105 g .",
    "now for the same mass of the black string and the 10-d black hole , the condition of an unstable black string due to the smaller entropy than 10-d black hole is    [ l : thin ] l ( 87 ) ^8 ( _ 8_7 ) r_+ 2.661  r_+ .    note also that    l ( 87 ) ^7 ( _ 8_7 ) r_+ 2.328  r_+ ,    such as the 10-d black hole can easily fit in the compact dimension @xmath34 . in terms of the wave number @xmath36 for the unstable perturbation gubs:02 , ( [ l : thin ] ) can be re - expressed as    k k_s ,  k_s 2 l_s 2.361  r_+^-1 ,    where @xmath37 is the entropy estimator``equal entropy for equal mass '' estimator  of the minimum length of compact dimension for the gl instability .",
    "this agrees with the gl s numerical analysis for the classical instability under linearized perturbations @xmath38 up to 2.4 % discrepancy . in gl",
    "s analysis is what i have called @xmath36 gubs:02 .",
    "and i use values of @xmath39 recently obtained by hirayama et al .",
    "hira:03 , which is more accurate than the original gl s analysis ; i thank g. kang for informing about this updated data .",
    "similar data has been also obtained by e. sorkin sork:04,sork : priv in a different context of gubser gubs:02 and wiseman wise:02 ; i thank e. sorkin for kindly sending his data . ]",
    "this good agreement is rather surprising since thermodynamic instability based on @xmath40 entropy arguments , which have quantum origins , does not generally imply a classical instability .",
    "the generalization of the string instability of the previous section to arbitrary @xmath1-branes ( @xmath41 ) in 10-d low energy string theory requires the knowledge on the compactfication . in this section ,",
    "i first consider a _",
    "thin - torus _ compactification with horizons @xmath42 which has one compact dimension @xmath34 with length @xmath5 and a very tiny volume @xmath43 for other compact dimensions .",
    "since the effect of small compact dimensions would be tiny , i would approximate this system by the black strings @xmath44 in @xmath45-dimensions effectively such as the transition problems between @xmath1-branes and 10-d black holes are reduced to those of black strings @xmath46 and @xmath45-d black holes . to this end , similarly to the previous section , let me approximate the @xmath45-d black holes by the ordinary @xmath47 metric , with @xmath45-d radial coordinate @xmath33 .",
    "then , the masses and entropies of the black string @xmath46 and the @xmath45-d black hole are , respectively ,    & & m_b.s.(n)=(n-2 ) _ n-2",
    "r_+^n-3 l16 g ,   s_b.s.(n)=_(n-2 ) r_+^n-2 l4 g , + & & m_b.h.(n+1)=(n-1 ) _ ( n-1 ) r_+^n-2 16 g ,   s_b.h.(n+1)=_n-1 r_+^n-1 4 g .",
    "now , for the same mass of the black string and the @xmath45-d black hole , the condition of an unstable black string due to the smaller entropy than @xmath45-d black hole is    [ k : thin ] l ( n-1n-2 ) ^n-1 _ n-1_n-2 r_+ 2  k_s^-1 ,    where @xmath48 is the entropy estimator of the maximum wave number for an unstable perturbation .",
    "note also that    [ f : thin ] l ( n-1n-2 ) ^n-2 _ n-1_n-2 r_+ 2 f  r_+ ,    where @xmath49 denotes how @xmath45-d black hole can fit in the compact direction @xmath34 , such as @xmath50 is required for a safe fitting .",
    "the values computed for @xmath48 and @xmath51 are listed and compared with the gl s data @xmath52 in table i , fig . 1 and table ii , fig .",
    "2 , respectively . table i and fig . 1 show that the discrepancy grows as @xmath1 grows ( @xmath15 decreases ) up to 35 % discrepancy for @xmath53 .",
    "but , in the light of entropy argument these discrepancy would only imply that the crude approximation , that i have taken , for the @xmath54 metric as the @xmath45-d black hole solution even with one compactified dimension @xmath34 , and/or the thin torus limit of the compactification , which treats one specific direction differently from others , becomes bad as the dimension of the compactification @xmath1 increases .",
    "so , this indicates that better approximation which treats equally all the compact directions is needed .",
    "this will be done in the next section .",
    "but , before this , let me note the followings .",
    ".table of the entropy estimator @xmath48 for isotropic torus and thin torus compactifications in comparison with the gl s data @xmath52 .",
    "the values in the brackets denote their discrepancies to gl s data ( @xmath55 ) ; the @xmath56 or @xmath57 sign represents whether it is bigger ( @xmath56 ) or smaller ( @xmath57 ) than gl s .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as a function of @xmath15 for black string @xmath58 and @xmath1-branes @xmath59 . the thin and the thick lines represent the values calculated for thin torus and isotropic torus compactifications , respectively .",
    "the crossing occurs at about @xmath60 .",
    ", width=377 ]    first , the widespread belief gubs:00,real:01,hira:01,hube:02 that the entropy argument for the classical instability should not be taken seriously was originated from the big discrepancy of 35 % with gl s numerical analysis for the @xmath17 case , which is found to be the worst case in the thin torus , i.e. , string , approximation of the @xmath1-branes of the 10-d low energy string theory .",
    "but my analysis shows that this is not quite correct , since @xmath17 case is not truly a black string but a 6-brane exactly , and is blind to the dimensionality @xmath1 of the brane s world volumes as long as @xmath61 . ] which would deform the black string picture quite much ; one should have considered the @xmath60 case to discuss the black string and compare with gl s data .",
    "second , note that the result ( [ k : thin ] ) and ( [ f : thin ] ) can be applied for any dimension @xmath15 to analyze the transition from a black string @xmath62 to @xmath45-d black hole @xmath47 , though i have introduced this set - up to approximate the @xmath1-brane solutions in 10-d string theory .",
    "then , it is interesting to observe that there is a _ critical dimension _",
    "@xmath63 above which @xmath64 such as @xmath45-d black hole can not fit in the compact direction @xmath34 ; in this case , approximating the ordinary @xmath54 as the final state solution needs some important correction due to the compact dimension myer:87 such as the black string can evolve into a different final state , presumably a non - uniform black string , between the ( uniform ) black string and the black hole .",
    "this indicates that the order of the phase transition between the uniform and the non - uniform black strings changes from the first ( i.e. , sudden transition ) to second order ( i.e. , smooth transition ) at the critical dimension @xmath65 .",
    "recently another estimator for the critical dimension has been considered by sorkin sork:04 but one finds a very good agreement between these two estimators .",
    "as a correction to the thin - torus compactification of the previous section , i will consider an isotropic @xmath1-dimensional torus compactification @xmath3 where all compactified directions are treated equally . to this end , let me approximate 10-d black hole by the ordinary @xmath32 metric , with 10-d black radial coordinate @xmath33 , similarly to sec .",
    "then , the masses and entropies of a black @xmath1-brane and 10-d black hole are , respectively ,    & & m_b.b.(n)=(n-2 ) _ n-2 r_+^n-3 v_p16 g ,   s_b.b.(n)=_(n-2 ) r_+^n-2 v_p4 g , + & & m_b.h.(10)=16 ^3 r_+^7 105 g ,   s_b.h.(10)=8 ^4 r_+^8 105 g .    now , for the same mass of the black @xmath1-branes and the 10-d black hole , the condition of an unstable black @xmath1-branes due to the smaller entropy than 10-d black hole is    [ vp1:iso ] v_p ( 8n-2 ) ^8 _ 8_n-2 r_+^10-n    while    [ vp2:iso ] v_p ( 8n-2 ) ^n-2 _ 8_n-2 r_+^10-n .",
    "moreover , since i am considering a @xmath1-dimensional torus with equal length @xmath66 , ( [ vp1:iso ] ) and ( [ vp2:iso ] ) can be re - expressed , in terms of @xmath5 and the associated entropy estimator of the maximum wave number @xmath48 for the unstable perturbation , as    [ k : iso ] l ( 8n-2 ) ^810-n ( _ 8_n-2)^110-n r_+ 2  k_s^-1    and    [ f : iso ] l ( 8n-2 ) ^810-n ( _ 8_n-2)^110-n r_+ 2 f  r_+ .",
    "the values computed for @xmath48 and @xmath51 are listed and plotted also in table i , fig . 1 and table ii , fig .",
    "2 , respectively , in comparison with gl s data @xmath52 and the results for the thin - torus compactfication . table i and fig . 1 show that the discrepancy of the thin torus approximation have been quite reduced in the isotropic torus and the worst one is about @xmath67 % for @xmath68 ; all the other cases have been less than about @xmath69 and the best one is 0.5 % for @xmath70 ; moreover , compared to the growing discrepancy for the thin - torus as @xmath1 grows ( @xmath15 decreases ) , that of the isotropic torus is almost stable such as this improved approximation is fairly good .    on the other hand , according to the result for @xmath51 in table ii and fig .",
    "2 , there is a critical dimension @xmath71 below which @xmath72 such as the 10-d black hole can not fit in the compact dimension @xmath34 .",
    "this implies that approximating the ordinary @xmath32 as the final state of the black @xmath1-branes needs some important corrections due to the compactified dimension such as the uniform black @xmath1-brane can evolve into a different final state , presumably a non - uniform black @xmath1-brane .",
    "so , the relatively big discrepancies for @xmath73 would not be so surprising in the light of entropy argument ; but it is a remarkable fact that @xmath17 case has a relatively good agreement with gl s data with 3 % discrepancy even though it does not have to be .",
    "hence , by taking into account this additional fact to the result of @xmath48 in table i and fig .",
    "1 , the true discrepancy in this approximation would be quite smaller and the reliable results would have discrepancy only about 0.5 % @xmath74 2.4 % by excluding @xmath75 cases .    furthermore , this also indicates a smooth decay of an unstable ( uniform ) black @xmath1-brane @xmath21 to the non - uniform state for @xmath15 as low as @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "this is in contrast to the decay of black string , where @xmath15 as large as @xmath20 is required for a smooth decay .",
    "more recently another estimator for the critical dimension , following sorkin sork:04 , has been also considered by kol and sorkin kol:04 and they found a very good agreement with mine again ; moreover they found interestingly that @xmath23 is the smallest total dimension of the spacetime to allow a smooth decay of an unstable black brane to the non - uniform state .",
    "i have shown that the usual entropy argument for the gl instability for @xmath0 appropriate black strings and @xmath1-branes gives surprising agreement up to a few percent .",
    "this may provide a strong support to the gl s horizon fragmentation , which would produce the array of  single in my analysis  higher dimensional schwarzschild - type s black holes finally ; this result is remarkable in that the end point of the unstable evolution , which is by its nature `` non - linear '' , crucially affects the onset of the instability calculation , which is by its nature `` linear '' .    on the other hand ,",
    "another estimator for the size of the black hole end - state relative to the compact dimension indicates a second order ( i.e. , smooth ) phase transition for some @xmath2 appropriate compactifications and total dimension of spacetime wherein the entropy argument is not appropriate .",

    ", hm - type s non - uniform black strings or @xmath1-branes can be a natural final state of the gl instability .",
    "this result agrees quite well with the analysis of kol and sorkin wherein different estimator has be considered @xcite .    _",
    "note added _ : after the first appearance of this paper , i was informed by e. sorkin that my analysis of the instability for thin - torus compactification is very similar to that of ref .",
    "sork:04 which uses a single dimensionless parameter @xmath78 instead of @xmath79 .",
    "afterward , i have checked that his result ( 9 ) on the critical values of @xmath80 for the onset of an instability agrees exactly with my result ( 6 ) . and",
    "his analysis sork:04,sork : priv on the black string perturbation shows a quite good agreement with the thin - torus set - up up to @xmath81 discrepancy for @xmath82 , in contrast to @xmath83 , where the isotropic - torus set - up is more favorable ( fig . [ fig : sorkin ] ) ; this indicates _ another critical dimension _ at @xmath60 which agrees with kol s `` merger point '' , where the string and black hole branches merge kol:02 .",
    "the increasing discrepancy above @xmath84 is not so surprising since this is the regime where the naive thin - torus set - up does not have to be correct , due to @xmath85 , such as the black string can evolve into a different final state , presumably a non - uniform black string , as in @xmath86 cases of isotropic - torus set - up in sec .",
