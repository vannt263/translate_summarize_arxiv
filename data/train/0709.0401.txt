    "w virginis ( aavso 1320 - 02 : j2000 ra : 13 26 1.993 , dec : -03 22 43.42 ) is the class prototype of the type ii cepheid variables .",
    "it has a period of about 17.3 days , and is relatively bright with maxima reaching @xmath15 . like many bright variables",
    ", it has become less - frequently monitored and studied in recent years .",
    "while several robotic telescopes monitor this and other objects as part of their all - sky campaigns , very little recent work has been done to perform intensive , multiwavelength photometry of w vir itself . despite being a cosmologically important class prototype , the behavior of w vir is still not fully understood . in particular , it is known to exhibit cycle - to - cycle variations , like all long - period cepheids .",
    "these variations can only be reliably tracked with continuous , season - long observing campaigns , and this is where the aavso and its members and partner observatories represent a remarkable new opportunity for the astronomical community to study neglected , interesting objects .",
    "the aavso was asked to provide photometric support for high - resolution spectroscopic observations of w virginis ( wallerstein et al .",
    ", in preparation ) throughout 2006 , and we initiated an observing campaign that included both amateur and professional observers , performing visual and instrumental photometry .",
    "these data are being used in the interpretation of the resulting spectroscopy , but they also represent a substantial new data set for this historic star . in particular , nightly @xmath0 observations with the _ sonoita research observatory _ 14-inch have yielded a valuable new multicolor dataset . when combined with @xmath1-band data from the _ all sky automated survey _",
    "@xcite , our @xmath1-band light curve spans 6.5 years , and covers nearly every cycle during the observing season .",
    "this is an important new photometric light curve for w vir , allowing us to study the multicolor behavior of this fundamentally important object on years - long timescales .    in this paper , we present new , multicolor photometry for w vir taken during 2006 and 2007 .",
    "we present continuous and folded light and color curves , describe the quality and statistical properties of the _ sonoita _ data , and present a comprehensive analysis of this important new data set . in section 2 , we describe in full the newly acquired observations , as well as the archival data used in our analyses . in section 3 , we describe our analyses including derivation of the full variability spectrum , determine a new ephemeris for this star , and present the results of our @xmath1-band and multicolor analyses . in section 4 , we discuss the physical consequences of our findings with particular emphasis on the unambiguous detection of the first overtone mode , and recommend future avenues for observational and theoretical research on w vir and on the type ii cepheids in general .",
    "despite the astrophysical importance of w vir , little concerted observational work was done on this star other than long - term monitoring by visual observers , short - term @xmath16 photometric campaigns covering a few cycles , or monitoring by automated systems ( e.g.  _ hipparcos _ and _ asas-3 _ ) .",
    "because of this , the novel observations conducted here represent a major increase in the observational record for w vir , and we discuss these observations in some detail .",
    "w vir has been observed over two seasons using the _ sonoita research observatory _ ( sro )",
    "35-cm telescope , located in southern arizona .",
    "an sbig stl-1001e ccd camera was used with johnson / cousins @xmath0 filters .",
    "the pixel scale is 1.25 arcsec / pixel , yielding a field of view of 21x21 arcminutes .",
    "each image was dark - subtracted and flatfielded using standard techniques .",
    "all stars in each image were extracted using routines from daophot @xcite .",
    "aperture photometry was performed , typically using apertures whose diameter was equal to 4 times the full - width - half - maximum of the star profiles .",
    "since w vir is located at galactic coordinates ( 319.5659 , + 58.3713 ) , no stars of comparable magnitude lie within the field of view .",
    "we therefore offset the field to the west to acquire a handful of fainter , but usable , comparison stars .",
    "a total of 6 stars , ranging from v=11.0 to v=13.6 , form an ensemble . using the inhomogeneous ensemble techniques similar to @xcite , we perform differential photometry of w vir using these six stars , resulting in an average per - observation error of five millimagnitudes .",
    "the celestron c14 optical telescope assembly has strong vignetting across the field .",
    "while flatfielding removes essentially all of this vignetting , a small residual offset may remain .",
    "we positioned the field exactly the same on all visits to ensure that any residual will just cause a systematic offset from the standard system .",
    "all stars in the 21x21 arcminute field have been calibrated by the sro telescope on 42 photometric nights . on each night , @xcite standards were observed to obtain transformation coefficients , along with a single a0 star that was followed from meridian to large airmass .",
    "these observations resulted in mean errors of about five millimagnitudes per magnitude for the comparison stars .",
    "the stars used are given in table [ compstars ] .",
    "photometry of all 115 stars in the field can be found on the aavso web site .",
    "astrometry of these comparison stars was determined using the ucac2 reference catalog @xcite along with the slalib astronomy utility software package @xcite .",
    "coordinates are given in decimal degrees , and are valid for epoch 2006.77 .",
    "errors are standard deviation of the mean .",
    "other major sources of data include : the _ all - sky automated survey _ @xcite , and _ hipparcos _ photometry @xcite transformed to @xmath1 using the calibration of @xcite ; and the aavso international database .",
    "we also made use of previously published observations of w vir collected and generously provided by l.  berdnikov ( 2002 , private communication ) ; these data include a number of @xmath16 and @xmath17 data sets published in @xcite ( observed by whitford and code at mount wilson ) , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "all but the _ asas-3 _ data were used solely in the compilation of our @xmath13 diagram , though we note the early @xmath16 data of @xcite were also used in the transformation of the _ hipparcos _ data to @xmath1 .",
    "we merged 6.5 years of @xmath1-band observations from sro and from the archives of the _",
    "asas-3 _ project @xcite to form a long - term light curve and perform a detailed time - series analysis .",
    "we limited this light curve to these two data sources because : ( a ) both are well - sampled , relatively homogeneous , and fully calibrated on a standard photometric system , and ( b ) the rate of period change in w vir is significant enough to introduce smearing of the signal over much longer timescales .",
    "the 6.5-year long _ asas-3 + sro _ @xmath1-band light curve of w virginis is shown in figure [ fig - vlc ] . aside from the large annual observing gaps due to solar conjunction , the @xmath1-band light curve of w vir is nearly continuous with at least a few ( and often many ) points obtained per cycle , and several cycles obtained during each observing season .",
    "we have three primary goals in performing this work .",
    "first we want to use a homogeneous , photometrically calibrated data set to determine the pulsation spectrum of w virginis over a long interval and define a new ephemeris .",
    "second , we want to study the long - term evolution of the light curve of w virginis , and determine whether the changes are due to multiple periods , secular period changes , nonlinear behavior , or some combination of these .",
    "third , we want to use the shorter set of multicolor photometry to study the multiwavelength behavior of w virginis , to gain more physical insight into the pulsations . to study the periodicities and period evolution of w vir , we used both fourier and @xmath13 analyses on the primary @xmath1-band dataset , on the new sro @xmath0 dataset , and on data from the aavso international database .",
    "we will discuss each of these in turn below .",
    "first , we performed a thorough fourier analysis of the 6.5-year @xmath1-band light curve , composed of _",
    "@xmath1 magnitudes and @xmath1 magnitudes obtained with sro .",
    "we chose not to include transformed _",
    "_ magnitudes because of the large gap between the end of _ hipparcos _ observations and the start of _ asas-3 _ observations , and because the period changes significantly enough over the 17-year span of the longer data set that it affects the fourier analysis .",
    "our analysis was performed using a newly written implementation of the fourier `` clean '' algorithm outlined in @xcite for which the fortran 90 source code is available upon request . for these calculations , we tested all frequencies between 0 and 0.8 c / d with a resolution @xmath18 c / d .",
    "we preceeded the computation of the final , high - resolution spectrum with a low - resolution scan ( at approximately the minimum frequency separation imposed by the span of the dataset ) to determine the correct mean value of the data from the zero - frequency amplitude .",
    "we heavily oversampled the final spectrum in the frequency domain by a factor of 64 , and used a gain of 0.05 per clean iteration to make the cleaning process as numerically stable as possible ; larger gain values and lower frequency resolution produced nearly identical frequencies at the cost of slightly higher noise , while the cost in oversampling is simply increased computation time .",
    "the final , cleaned spectrum of the 6.5-year , @xmath1-band data set is shown in figure [ fig - ftclean ] .",
    "there are three groups of frequencies of interest : the primary pulsation frequency , @xmath19 , and its integer - multiple harmonics @xmath20 to @xmath21 ; a secondary frequency , @xmath22 ; and a low - frequency peak , @xmath23 , that appears to be a beat frequency of @xmath24 .",
    "the frequencies , amplitudes , and phases of these frequencies are given in table [ freqtable ] .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by the primary pulsation frequency of @xmath25 c / d ( @xmath2 d ) and its integer multiples .",
    "the higher order harmonics have significant amplitude , and as a result the light curve is non - sinusoidal .",
    "we compared the @xmath1-band fourier component parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 of these integer multiple frequencies with previously published values @xcite , and find that our values are reasonably consistent with prior observations .",
    "we note that our values were derived directly from the cleaned fourier spectrum ; these values are often derived via sine wave fitting , and are done to lower order , and so may not be strictly comparable .",
    "a comparison of our derived parameters and those published elsewhere is given in table [ fourtable ] .",
    "our derived values of @xmath28 are consistent with previously published values obtained from other observations , with the only minor exception being @xmath29 which is lower by a factor of two in our data . as a whole",
    ", this shows that the underlying pulsations driven at @xmath30 are stable throughout the recent observational record , indicating that the underlying pulsational waveform is unchanged over recent years .",
    "this is good evidence for w vir being a stable pulsator despite it being a long - period cepheid . like the other long - period type ii cepheids ( and unlike the bl her stars and classical cepheids )",
    ", there is no clear trend in @xmath28 with period .",
    "however , the relatively large value of @xmath31 is quite similar to those of other high - amplitude pulsators , while the value of @xmath32 ( very close to @xmath33 ) results in a nearly symmetric ( if non - sinusoidal ) light curve unlike the sawtooth shapes of shorter period cepheids where @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath1-band data set is of sufficient length and photometric quality that we are able to compute an accurate , current ephemeris for w vir .",
    "we can then compute an @xmath13 curve , and establish a rate of period change based upon these archival data . to determine the current ephemeris",
    ", we created a synthetic light curve using the frequencies , amplitudes , and phases for @xmath19 through @xmath21 given in table [ freqtable ] , excluding @xmath22 and @xmath35 . after ensuring that this curve was a good fit to the @xmath1-band light curve , we chose the best - observed maximum ( hjd 2452758.172 ) nearest the temporal center of the data set ( hjd 2453078.271 ) as the zero - point of our ephemeris :    @xmath36    we then used this ephemeris to measure @xmath13 for all available data for w vir",
    "the available data includes visual observations from the aavso _ international database _ spanning jd 2419500 to the present , along with previously published photometry of various kinds collected by l. berdnikov and collaborators ( berdnikov 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "when the data were sufficient to allow fitting , individual cycles were fit by eye using a synthetic mean curve placed at the closest predicted time of maximum .",
    "we adjusted both the magnitudes and times of the observed data points to obtain a best fit to the synthetic cycle ; a magnitude adjustment was often required due both to the difference in response between visual estimates and @xmath1-band , and to cycle - to - cycle variations not included in the synthetic mean curve . for cases where there was no objective , unambiguous way to improve the fit with either a magnitude or a temporal offset , we left one or both equal to zero ; for this reason , many of the @xmath13 measures are `` 0.0 '' , skewing the @xmath13 diagram close to the zero point of the ephemeris . for the visual data , we used individual observers when possible to minimize scatter between the different subjective responses by different observers , but the @xmath13 values obtained from visual data were marginal in general due to incomplete coverage of pulsation cycles .",
    "although aavso data prior to 1932 exist , they are generally not of sufficient quantity or homogeneity to allow unambiguous cycle fitting",
    ". fits to instrumental photometry were generally better though they too suffer from incomplete coverage of cycles , and are also affected by the intrinsic cycle - to - cycle variations .",
    "we initially estimated errors on the times of maxima to be around 0.5 days , and the resulting reduced @xmath37 values of the fits suggest the errors are likely around 0.35 to 0.4 days .",
    "the resulting @xmath13 diagram for w vir is shown in figure [ figo - c ] , with first- and second - order polynomial fits superimposed .",
    "there is clearly a significant trend in the @xmath13 curve , and the period - change term is identical to within error bars for fits involving only a second - order term , and a quadratic ( first and second order term ) fit .",
    "the reduced @xmath37 value for the pure second - order fit is the same as that for the quadratic fit .",
    "a fit involving only a first - order term ( which measures only an error in the period , rather than a period change ) has a worse @xmath37 value than either of the other two fits .",
    "because of this , we are confident that we have detected the period change of w vir over the span of data used in this paper .",
    "the resulting ephemeris with a second - order correction is    @xmath38    our result on the last 75 years of data contradicts the inconclusive results found by @xcite , who found essentially no period change when analyzing archival times of maximum and minimum dating to the 19th century .",
    "we have not included data prior to 1932 in our analysis , but we note the existence of both sparse aavso observations and published photometry along with archived times of maximum and minimum , and plan to reanalyze these data for a future paper .      a major part of this project was to observe w virginis in @xmath0 simultaneously to better understand the underlying physical behavior of the pulsations , and provide full photometric coverage for the spectroscopy performed by wallerstein et al .",
    "very little multicolor work has been done on w vir since the early photometric studies performed in the 1950s .",
    "some multicolor amateur data exists , with the most notable being the @xmath17 photometry of m. bonnardeau taken during the spring and summer of 2005 , and the aavso data submitted as part of our support for the wallerstein campaign .",
    "the observations we obtained with sro represent the largest multicolor data set obtained for w vir in its history .",
    "the full @xmath0 light curve taken at sro is shown in figure [ fig - sonlc ] , and the @xmath0 light curve folded on a period of 17.27134 days is shown in figure [ fig - sonfold1 ] .",
    "we note that these light curves include all data through the end of the spring 2007 observing season ( jd 2454299 ) , which were obtained and reduced after the bulk of the analysis for data through jd 2454255 was completed for this paper .",
    "the additional 40 days of data do not change the main results given in the prior sections of this work and are included to provide more complete phase coverage of the 2007 season .",
    "pulsation amplitude is highest in @xmath39 and weakens progressively through @xmath1 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath39-band light curve has a sharp peak followed by a short plateau and decline , while the other three bands rapidly rise to a plateau and remain constant for approximately half a cycle .",
    "maximum light occurs immediately following the rapid rise at @xmath39 and @xmath1 , while @xmath40 remains essentially flat , and @xmath41 has a slowly rising plateau with peak approximately 0.2 cycles after @xmath39 and @xmath1 .",
    "we determined the fourier amplitude ratios @xmath42 and phase differences @xmath26 for @xmath43 for each of the @xmath0 light curves .",
    "the amplitude ratios are shown in figure [ fig - rval ] , and the phase differences are shown in figure [ fig - dphi ] .",
    "the amplitude ratios are largest in @xmath39 and smallest in @xmath41 for all harmonics , indicating less sinusoidal light variations at bluer wavelengths .",
    "the value of @xmath44 is close to @xmath33 in all four bands , which results in a much more symmetric light curve , and it asymptotically approaches @xmath33 at redder wavelengths .",
    "the values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 would produce larger asymmetries , but the harmonics have lower amplitude and thus a smaller effect on the overall light curve .",
    "generally , the amplitude ratios and phase differences indicate that the light curves become increasingly symmetrical ( though not purely sinusoidal ) at redder wavelengths .",
    "the @xmath47 color spans a much larger range ( + 0.4 at maximum to + 1.1 at minimum ) than do @xmath48 or @xmath49 because the temperature range is large ( @xmath50 k ) and the spectral peak at @xmath51 lies within the @xmath39 band .",
    "the color change is very rapid during rising light , going from reddest to bluest within 0.2 cycles ; the steepness of both the light curve and the color curve suggest a strong shock , and this is consistent with past spectroscopic studies ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the folded light curve in figure [ fig - sonfold1 ] shows much larger scatter ( @xmath52 mag ) than the photometric errors ( generally @xmath53 mag ) , indicating that there are cycle - to - cycle variations .",
    "this is expected given the amplitudes of @xmath54 and @xmath22 ; folding on twice the fundamental period decreases the scatter considerably , although it does not remove it entirely , particularly for the 2007 season .",
    "color - color plots of @xmath47 versus @xmath55 for single - season data folded on twice the fundamental period are shown in figure [ fig - cc ] .",
    "the color - color plot clearly shows that the deeper of the two minima ( min 2 ) has a significantly redder @xmath47 color than ( min 1 ) , indicating a cooler temperature .",
    "the fact that this difference between the two minima persists throughout the season indicates that the pulsations are being modulated with a period approximately twice that of the main period .",
    "the @xmath40-band light curve shows much larger scatter than @xmath39 , @xmath1 , or @xmath41 when folded , indicating that there is a transient , irregular spectral feature occurring within the @xmath40 band .",
    "we have no means of uncovering details of this feature with broadband photometry , but the work of @xcite hints strongly that it may be variable post - shock emission lines in an extended atmosphere .",
    "@xcite found very large variations in h@xmath56 flux over the course of the pulsation cycle , as well as irregularity in the evolution of the line profile variations .",
    "the flux variation of the h@xmath56 emission alone is about five percent ; the width of the line is about 0.5% of the width of the @xmath40 band , and the flux varies between 0.5 and 6 times the continuum , which could generate variations at the level of about 0.1 magnitudes .",
    "but what is striking is that there are large variations at a given phase from cycle to cycle , which indicates that the shock features are not occurring at the same time as they propagate into the extended atmosphere , and do not have the same strength .",
    "this suggests that the response of the extended atmosphere is irregular , despite the regularity of the photospheric motions .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy over several cycles may provide more insight into this behavior .",
    "there are several important results of our work .",
    "we conclusively show that there are cycle - to - cycle variations in the light curve of w vir , but that these variations appear to be due to the presence of two pulsation modes , and not to inherent instabilities in the pulsation .",
    "the fact that these modes are well - defined in the fourier spectrum suggests that the pulsation behavior is largely linear in nature .",
    "prewhitening of the @xmath1-band data with the frequency set in table [ freqtable ] does not fully remove the signal , which suggests that a second process is at work  either a secular period change or low - level nonlinearity .",
    "the period of w vir is definitely changing , as was shown by the @xmath13 diagram in figure [ figo - c ] , and the fact that the prewhitening is clearly worse at the temporal extremes of the light curve than at the temporal center suggests that a secular period change may explain long - term changes without requiring nonlinear behavior .",
    "the secondary pulsation frequencies @xmath23 and @xmath22 are real , and are not aliases of the main frequency .",
    "the color differences between alternating minima seen in the 2006 @xmath0 data must have a physical origin , and a beat frequency of @xmath57 is the easiest interpretation .",
    "the fact that the pattern of alternating minima did not repeat as clearly during the 2007 observing season is caused by the low - frequency peak @xmath23 not being exactly @xmath58 .",
    "the two secondary spectral peaks could be a manifestation of _ period - doubling _ , as was described ( for example ) in @xcite .",
    "however , two facts suggest a purely modal explanation for w vir rather than a fundamental change in pulsation behavior .",
    "first , the two peaks in question are not _ exact _ rational fractions of the main frequency to within the frequency precision of either peak . any nonlinear process which `` doubles '' the primary period without making it exactly twice the period while keeping it relatively stable over time would be difficult to explain .",
    "second , the frequency ratio @xmath59 is consistent with the likely frequency ratio of the radial fundamental and first overtone modes of population ii cepheids having periods longer than 10 days .",
    "( see @xcite for recent models . )",
    "we propose that the cycle - to - cycle variations of w vir are best explained in terms of combinations of linear pulsation modes , and that the strength of these variations is due to the near - resonant ratio of the fundamental and first overtone frequencies .",
    "we note that because this particular frequency ratio should only occur in well - evolved , long - period cepheids ( possibly those on their last crossing ) , this stage may be the last waypoint in the evolution of w vir stars before they move up the agb into the rv tauri phase . for the general population of long - period type ii cepheids that show strong cycle - to - cycle variability",
    ", their apparent irregularity may be due to overtone modes instead of nonlinear pulsation behavior .",
    "the link between the w virginis stars and the rv tauri stars has been discussed previously ( see @xcite for example ) , and observational work on the lmc w virginis and rv tauri sample @xcite shows a progression in the physical and pulsational characteristics of these two classes .",
    "the physical distinction between the two in this scenario is that the w vir stars are slightly less evolved members of the same population whose lower @xmath60 ratios keep them within the linear pulsation regime ; the rv tauri stars , having larger @xmath60 ratios , are in the nonlinear regime . interestingly , although rv tauri stars are clearly nonlinear in nature , the work of @xcite showed that their seemingly chaotic behavior is confined to a low - dimensional phase space , and they interpret this as being due to the interaction of as few as two pulsation modes  exactly what we see with w vir .",
    "the picture that emerges is that double- or multiperiodicity becomes increasingly likely at longer periods and larger @xmath60 ratios among population ii giants , and that both the type ii cepheids of long period and the rv tauri stars exhibit this behavior .",
    "the phenomenological difference between the two is then simply that the rv tauri stars have reached the point where nonlinearities overwhelm the pulsational dynamics of the envelope , leading to irregularity in the light curve .",
    "we suggest three future studies that could confirm this picture . first , evolution and nonadiabatic , linear pulsation models of w vir stars having periods longer than 10 days are crucial to studying the physical link between the two classes , and we strongly encourage the cepheid modeling community to expand their model grids to these longer periods and higher luminosities into the rv tauri region .",
    "second , a long - term photometric study of other long - period type ii cepheids should be undertaken to search for linear multiperiodicities .",
    "the existence of many all - sky photometric surveys such as _ asas _ @xcite greatly facilitates this , and such an analysis is currently underway ( wils & otero , private communication ) .",
    "finally , an analysis of the chaotic dynamics of a larger sample of rv tauri stars ( and the type ii cepheids ) should be done , as was performed on r scuti @xcite and ac her @xcite .",
    "such studies could easily be performed on both large - scale photometric survey databases , and on existing archives of long - term visual observations .",
    "despite being the class prototype of a cosmologically important class of variable stars , our understanding of w virginis and other type ii cepheids is incomplete . until now",
    ", little concentrated observational work has been done on this object other than with single - cycle photometry or sparse coverage over a single observing season with photometry and spectroscopy . the use of an automated telescope with a well - planned observing queue made it possible to follow w virginis regularly for nearly two years .",
    "this highlights the power of small , automated telescopes for performing long - term studies of neglected stars , and also the fact that there remains work still to be done even on bright , `` well - studied '' objects .",
    "our work has clarified some long standing questions about the pulsation behavior , and confirmed the existence of double - mode pulsations and the resulting cycle variations in this star . despite the existence of a second pulsation period ,",
    "the pulsational signature of the dominant mode is very stable over time , suggesting that w vir at least does not show incipient instabilities like those seen in some long - period type ii cepheids .",
    "an interesting question then becomes where is the boundary between the parameter spaces of the type ii cepheids and the rv tauri stars , and at what point to the linear pulsations of cepheids give way to the nonlinear behavior shown in the rv tauri stars ?",
    "linear , nonadiabatic pulsation models of both type ii cepheids and rv tauri stars clearly need to be generated using modern opacities to map out the parameter space of mass , luminosity and temperature to determine fundamental and overtone mode periods and their nonadiabatic growth rates ; hydrodynamic models will be key to understanding where the transition between linearity and nonlinearity lies , and we encourage the computation of both by the theoretical modeling community .",
    "we wish to thank j.  gross , d.  terrell , and w.  cooney for their permission to use the _ sonoita research observatory _ for this project . as always , we acknowledge with gratitude the observations made by members of the aavso s worldwide observing community over the last century , without whom this work would not be possible .",
    "we also thank l.  berdnikov for supplying us with the compiled published photometry in 2002 . and",

    "<S> we present the results of recent long - term @xmath0 photometric monitoring of the type ii cepheid prototype w virginis . </S>",
    "<S> these new observations , made during the 2006 and 2007 observing season , represent the longest homogeneous , multicolor light curve of w vir to date . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 light and color curves show conclusively that w vir exhibits modest but detectable cycle - to - cycle variations , the cause of which appears to be multiperiodicity rather than nonlinearity . </S>",

    "<S> we find a best - fit period @xmath2 days ; along with this period and the integer - ratio harmonics @xmath3 through @xmath4 inclusive , we clearly detect two additional periods , @xmath5 and @xmath6 that are close to but not exactly @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the former , @xmath9 days , we interpret to be the first overtone mode ; the latter , @xmath10 days is close to the beat period of @xmath11 , as well as to the value of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the previously reported but thus far unconfirmed descriptions of alternating minima as manifestations of this multiperiodicity . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use the period derived from the @xmath1-band light curve to define a new ephemeris : @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we compiled an @xmath13 diagram spanning 75 years from 1932 to 2007 using a variety of published photometric data and aavso visual observations , and derived a period change term for the ephemeris equal to @xmath14 , indicating a period decrease . </S>"
