    "superconductivity in the @xmath15fe@xmath13as@xmath13 ( @xmath15 = ba , sr or ca ) family of compounds , frequently referred to as 122 iron pnictides , can be induced in a variety of ways .",
    "it can be achieved by hole - doping with alkali @xmath16 metal substitution of alkali earth metal @xmath15 @xcite as in ( ba@xmath2k@xmath17)fe@xmath13as@xmath13 , transition metal substitution on fe site as in @xmath15(fe@xmath18)@xmath1as@xmath1 @xcite , or isoelectron substitution on as site as in @xmath15fe@xmath13(as@xmath2p@xmath17)@xmath13 @xcite . in the rest of the text we will label materials by the type of @xmath15 and dopant elements , such as bak122 , ba@xmath19122 , or bap122 .",
    "approximately the same maximum @xmath5 of about 30  k is achieved for most alkali earth elements and substitutions , which suggests common origin of superconductivity for this class @xcite .",
    "another unifying feature is universal observation of superconductivity in close proximity to stripe - type antiferromagnetic order , with maximum @xmath20 observed at a doping level close to a critical point where the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature @xmath21 .    despite this common phenomenology , studies of the normal state resistivity @xcite and superconducting state properties ,",
    "see for example @xcite for review , revealed unexpected diversity . for example , studies of the superconducting gap structure from penetration depth @xcite , directional heat transport @xcite , and heat capacity @xcite as a function of doping suggested full gap at optimal doping universally in ba@xmath19122 and bak122 @xcite , evolving towards strongly anisotropic and nodal in the under - doped and overdoped regimes .",
    "a similar trend is found in the other families of iron pnictides , e.g. co- and environmentally doped nafeas @xcite and ca10 - 3 - 8 @xcite . in sharp contrast , the gap is nodal in bap122 at optimal doping @xcite , it remains nodal for all compositions , and clear signatures of a quantum critical point can be tracked in the properties of the superconducting condensate @xcite .",
    "limited data about the superconducting gap structure available for compounds with other alkali earth metals , different from ba , suggest that these unique properties of phosphorus doped compositions may be universal , and are at least observed in srp122 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to get a broader insight into the properties of p - doped materials .",
    "the upper critical field of iron pnictides was studied systematically over the phase diagram of baco122 @xcite and revealed a clear distinction between underdoped and over - doped regimes .",
    "this distinction was suggested to be linked with change of the topology of the fermi surface , however , it can be related to the evolution of the superconducting gap anisotropy in this family as well .",
    "indeed , in stoichiometric iron - pnictide superconductors , full gap lifeas @xcite , and nodal kfe@xmath13as@xmath13 @xcite , studies of the upper critical fields @xcite reveal significantly different temperature dependences .",
    "relatively little is known about @xmath14 of p - doped materials in which measurements so far were limited to a temperature range close to zero - field @xmath5 @xcite , and in view of suggested nodal gap structure it is of interest to get insight into the temperature dependent upper critical field of this system .    in this article",
    "we report measurements of the anisotropic upper critical field in single crystals of optimally doped srp122 , @xmath4 = 0.35 , using the pulsed magnetic field facility at los alamos national high magnetic field laboratory .",
    "we find a clear difference between the temperature - dependent @xmath0 for fields along and transverse to the tetragonal @xmath22-axis .",
    "the dependence for @xmath6 is close to @xmath10-linear , which is very similar to the behavior found in previous studies on nodal kfe@xmath13as@xmath13 @xcite , but very dissimilar with that of full - gap lifeas @xcite .",

    "the resistive transition is rather sharp , @xmath31 2  k , and its end point at 25  k is close to an onset of a sharp frequency shift in zero - field tdr experiments .    for this study we used two small single crystals from the same batch .",
    "one sample was irradiated with 1.4 gev @xmath32pb@xmath33 ions at the argonne tandem linear accelerator system ( atlas ) with ion flux of  5x10@xmath34 ions@xmath35s@xmath36m@xmath37 .",
    "the thickness of this sample of approximately 20 @xmath38 m was much smaller than stopping distance of the ions , @xmath39 60 @xmath38 m , thus allowing creation of columnar defects .",

    "several features of the data should be mentioned .",
    "the data for magnetic fields perpendicular to the plane field orientation , @xmath9 , in general follow a @xmath10-linear dependence .",
    "the data for magnetic fields parallel to the plane , @xmath23(t ) , show a clear tendency for saturation approaching @xmath46 , which is a common expectation for both orbital @xcite and paramagnetic @xcite limiting mechanisms of the upper critical field .    in fig .",
    "[ gammasrp122 ] we plot the temperature - dependent anisotropy parameter , @xmath47 , for pristine and irradiated samples of srp122 .",
    "as is common for iron - arsenide superconductors , the anisotropy parameter is strongly temperature dependent . in most of the iron - arsenides",
    "the anisotropy parameter monotonically decreases upon cooling @xcite . upon irradiation the @xmath0",
    "anisotropy decreases , whereas @xmath5 is hardly changed .",
    "these findings are similar to the results on heavy - ion irradiated optimally doped bak122 @xcite . taken in conjunction with flattening of @xmath11",
    ", this fact is frequently discussed as a signature of paramagnetic effects in magnetic fields parallel to the plane @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the same feature of monotonically decreasing upon cooling @xmath48 is explained as a consequence of strong multi - band effects in iron pnictides @xcite .",
    "for the description of the upper critical field in srp122 , it is important to understand the superconducting gap structure of this material .",
    "although the detailed measurements as a function of doping were not performed yet , the available nmr @xcite , microwave @xcite , and radio - frequency london penetration depth @xcite measurements suggest that the superconducting gap of optimally doped srp122 is nodal .",
    "the effect of the nodal gap structure on the temperature and angular dependence of the upper critical field is a long standing problem in the field of unconventional superconductivity , stemming back to the early 80 s @xcite .",
    "while these effects in multi - band superconductors may be far too complicated @xcite , we decided to take a purely empirical approach and compare the temperature dependent @xmath0 for various iron - based materials .",

    "several experimental studies reported nearly @xmath10-linear @xmath9 .",
    "nearly straight @xmath9 for @xmath6 was observed in mgb@xmath13 @xcite and was explained in the orbital - limiting model for two - band superconductivity in the dirty limit .",

    "similarly , near @xmath10-linear @xmath14 was observed in doped iron - based superconductors , baco122 @xcite , bak122 , and fesete @xcite .",

    "the @xmath64linear dependence of @xmath0 was found in other superconductors . in kos@xmath13o@xmath65",

    "interestingly , here the behavior at ambient pressure closely follows a square root dependence as expected for paramagnetic pauli limiting @xcite , while with pressure this dependence becomes close to @xmath10-linear @xcite .",
    "a similar trend is found in other organic superconductors @xcite , and possible relation of @xmath10-linear dependence to the formation of inhomogeneous fulde - ferelle - larkin - ovchinnikov state @xcite was suggested by the experiments on samples with varying disorder @xcite .",

    "it shows whh - like behavior with clear saturation as @xmath69 for @xmath70plane and practically @xmath10-linear variation for @xmath71 c - axis .",
