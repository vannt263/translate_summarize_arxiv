    "the determination of the signal template of the radiating companion of a black hole is of great importance for the forthcoming interferometric gravitational observatories . an inspiralling neutron star or a several solar - mass black hole orbiting a massive black hole , as well as a particle constituent contributing to the radiation of the debris trapped by the black hole are notable examples of these companions . either is the case , one wants to describe the evolution of the orbit of a test particle in the neighborhood of a black hole under the influence of gravitational radiation backreaction . in a highly idealized picture ,",
    "the orbit of the particle is a carter geodesic@xcite characterized by four constants of the motion , the energy , the total angular momentum , the rest - mass of the particle and the separation constant . in the spirit of perturbation theory , the radiation backreaction effects may be taken into account by evolving these constants of the motion , thus picturing the trajectory of the particle by a sequence of geodesic orbits .",
    "the history of the orbit may be divided in separate epoches .",
    "for example , the first thing that happens to a particle trapped by a nonrotating _ schwarzschild _ black hole on an arbitrary but distant orbit is that it loses eccentricity due to radiation losses , and the radius shrinks until the close region of the last stable circular orbit is approached .",
    "there one has to replace the adiabatic picture with one valid in the strong field regime .    the description of a generic orbit in the strong field region of a spinning _ kerr _",
    "black hole is difficult ( as has been pointed out by thorne@xcite ) due to the special nature of the separation constant which lacks a straightforward geometrical interpretation .",
    "recently , progress in treating the separation constant has been reported by ori@xcite .",
    "there is a considerable ease in the description of special orbits such as equatorial or quasicircular , and in fact , several papers have obtained the signal templates for such special orbits . in order that any of these special orbits can be credited as significant contributor to the gravitational signal , one has to make sure that the carter constant evolves to the envisaged special values .",
    "several authors have recently published results on radiative losses by systems of spinning masses .",
    "kidder , will and wiseman@xcite formulate the problem by using the lagrangian ( proposed by barker and oconnell@xcite ) for bodies with finite masses and spins .",
    "they and kidder @xcite compute the spin - orbit and spin - spin contributions to the momentary radiative loss of energy , linear and angular momenta . in the test particle",
    "limit their results have subsequently been used by shibata@xcite , in his study of equatorial orbits , and by ryan@xcite . by computing the backreaction forces",
    ", ryan obtains the power and angular momentum losses for circular and generic orbits .    in our work",
    ", we have taken up the evolution of the orbit in the far field region of the black hole .",
    "the trajectory of the idealized , nonradiating particle is described by the lense - thirring picture@xcite .",
    "this picture emerges in the test particle limit of the scenario described in @xcite .",
    "the spin @xmath5 of the black hole is fixed to the @xmath6 axis .",
    "the orbit is viewed approximately as an ellipse precessing in a plane which rotates about @xmath7 .",
    "the motion is characterized by three constants : the energy @xmath8 , the magnitude @xmath9 and spin projection @xmath10 of the orbital angular momentum , and by two slowly changing angle parameters @xmath2 and @xmath11 .",
    "the lense - thirring approximation is linear in the spin terms , thus the ( additive ) schwarzschild effects may be neglected in this treatment .    in an earlier paper@xcite ,",
    "we have computed the radiation losses from the mass quadrupole tensor in the lense - thirring approximation , by the orbit smoothing method of landau and lifshitz@xcite .",
    "however , one may be rightly concerned about the degradation of accuracy of this computation , as a price of the relative simplicity introduced by the smoothing method .    in the present paper , we drop the orbit smoothing , and we include the velocity quadrupole tensor @xmath12 in the description of the radiative losses . in the test particle limit , this ( formally ) corresponds to the 1pn approximation@xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we describe the orbital motion in the lense - thirring approximation . in terms of a set of new angular variables ( related to euler rotations ) ,",
    "the equations of motion take a particularly simple form : all time derivatives depend on the radial variable @xmath13 alone .    in sec .",
    "3 , we explore the advantages of having a pure radial equation of motion .",
    "we find the turning points at @xmath14 which allow us to parameterize the radial motion by trigonometric functions .",
    "integrations over the time can be replaced by integrations over the parameter , which are straightforward in principle , but can be messy in practice .",
    "we evade such complications by finding suitable parametrizations .",
    "the first parameter @xmath15 we introduce is a generalization of the eccentric anomaly of the keplerian orbits .",
    "it is employed for computing the half period defined as the time spent by the particle between consecutive turning points . for the purpose of averaging the radiative losses , and for determining the change in the new angular variables , a generalized true anomaly parameter @xmath16",
    "is properly defined . in terms of this parameter ,",
    "when integration by the residue theorem is performed , the only pole of the integrands will be in the origin .    in sec .",
    "4 , we compute the rates of change of the constants of motion due to radiation backreaction , to first order in @xmath7 , by employing the radiative multipole tensors of kidder , will and wiseman@xcite , which originate in the blanchet - damour - iyer formalism@xcite . as we are interested in the cumulative effects of the secular motion , we compute averaged losses over the period of radial motion .",
    "we give the losses in an unambiguous manner in terms of the constants of motion @xmath17 and @xmath10 .",
    "as has been pointed out by ryan @xcite , the definition of the orbit parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 is subject to ambiguities . in sec . 5",
    ", we define the semimajor axis and eccentricity . with advantages explained in the main text ,",
    "our definitions differ both from ryan s and the ones used in the lense - thirring paper .",
    "we rewrite all losses in terms of our orbital parameters @xmath20 and @xmath19 .    in the concluding remarks ,",
    "we complete the characterization of the changes caused by gravitational radiation by giving the change in the @xmath3 angle parameters over one orbit .",
    "we then compare our results with those of other authors .",
    "we wish to make some comments on the expansion procedure we have adopted .",
    "earlier works employ either the expansion parameter @xmath21 or the inverse @xmath22 of the speed of light .",
    "since we eliminate @xmath23 and @xmath24 by use of the first integrals of the motion , we choose to retain @xmath25 and @xmath26 for bookkeeping of the orders in our formalism .",
    "the correction terms in the lagrangian , in the equations of motion and radiation losses will carry an extra @xmath27 factor . in our computation , we keep only the terms containing the spin @xmath0 from among these correction terms , thus we may as well choose @xmath0 as our expansion parameter .",
    "our treatment of radiation backreaction effects can be generalized beyond the lense - thirring approximation . in a follow - up paper@xcite",
    "we will apply our averaging method and parameterization for computing the backreaction effects on a bound system of two finite masses .",
    "we consider the orbit of a small particle of mass @xmath28 about a body with mass @xmath29 and angular momentum vector @xmath30 . in the lense - thirring approximation@xcite",
    ", the lagrangian of the system has the form@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 , a dot denotes @xmath33 and the term describing ( perturbative ) rotation effects is @xmath34 the cartesian coordinates of the test particle are @xmath35 , with origin chosen at the black hole .",
    "hence the orbital momentum @xmath36 and runge - lenz vector @xmath37 satisfy the equations of motion , respectively @xmath38 @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the momentum of the orbiting mass . note that the angular momentum @xmath41 undergoes a pure rotation about the spin with angular velocity : @xmath42    from ( [ l ] ) and ( [ a ] ) , the vector @xmath43 can be written in terms of the basis @xmath44 in the plane with normal @xmath41 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 . inserting this expression of @xmath47 in ( [ adot ] )",

    "since the motion of @xmath41 is a pure rotation , its magnitude @xmath9 is also constant : @xmath53 the constants of the motion are @xmath54}-{g \\mu m\\over",

    "is also conserved : @xmath59 the first integrals of the equations of motion follow from ( [ eq : e])-([eq : l2 ] ) by simple algebra ( we need not recourse to the hamilton - jacobi formalism ) .",
    "thus the equation of the radial motion takes the first - order form , decoupled from the angular degrees of freedom : @xmath60 the equations for the angular variables @xmath61 , however , are coupled among themselves and with the @xmath13 motion : @xmath62    there is an alternative description of the motion in the lense - thirring approximation which bears a more intimate geometrical relation to the picture provided by perturbation theory .",
    "we shall introduce this formalism by performing time - dependent euler rotations about the origin so as to place the kepler ellipse in its momentary orientation : @xmath63 here @xmath64 is the initial position of the particle on the plane perpendicular to @xmath41  ( although @xmath41 is different from @xmath65 , the condition @xmath66 is fulfilled ) .",
    "a rotation about the cartesian @xmath67 and @xmath6 axes is given , respectively , by    @xmath68    the coordinates of the particle are written in terms of the euler angles @xmath69 and @xmath70 as @xmath71    hence we get the relations    @xmath72    which allow us to express the time derivatives of the new variables :    @xmath73    note that @xmath74 and @xmath75 carries the interpretation of angular velocity of rotation about @xmath7 and in the plane perpendicular to @xmath41 respectively .",
    "an important feature of the new coordinates @xmath76 is that their derivatives appear linearly in the equations of motion ( [ psit ] ) and ( [ phit ] ) .",
    "this is not the case with the polar coordinates ( [ polar ] ) because the root of @xmath77 can not be extracted .",
    "the geometrical interpretation of the angle variable @xmath78 assures that it is monotonously changing .",
    "we choose @xmath70 to increase with the motion evolving .",
    "there is a freedom in the precise way one introduces the three euler - angle variables in place of the polar angles .",
    "even though the equations of motion are made simple by use of the angular variables ( [ newvar]-[newvar2 ] ) , the description of the momentary plane of orbit is tied to a different choice of the euler angles @xmath79 , where the initial @xmath6 axis is chosen along @xmath80 rather than along @xmath41 .",
    "these angular variables appear ( with the appropriate change in notation ) in the lense - thirring paper .",
    "the angle @xmath81 is not a constant , and the resulting equations are less simple .",
    "the primed angles will not be employed in our computations , and we relegate their discussion to the appendix .",
    "we now proceed with the solution of the equations of motion .",
    "first consider the radial equation ( [ radial ] ) .",
    "for the turning points @xmath14 , we get the cubic equation @xmath82 in the no - spin limit , @xmath83 , the solutions are ( the unphysical ) @xmath84 and @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the length of the runge - lenz vector to zeroth order : @xmath87    when a small spin term is present , the roots of ( [ cubic ] ) will have a slightly different form from ( [ rpm ] ) : @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are assumed to be small . note that the constants @xmath17 and @xmath10 will not coincide with their zeroth order limits .",
    "the constant @xmath86 is still defined by ( [ a0 ] ) , although it is not identical with the length @xmath92 of the runge - lenz vector ( which is not constant ) .",
    "writing the cubic equation as @xmath93 , we get    @xmath94r+2e\\mu[-r^2(\\epsilon_++\\epsilon_- + \\epsilon)+r(\\epsilon_+r_- + \\epsilon_-r_++\\epsilon(r_++r_- ) ) -\\epsilon r_+r_-]=0\\ .\\ ] ]    the first term is the zeroth - order part of the original equation , written in terms of the roots , thus it equals @xmath95 . inserting the chosen form of the roots we get @xmath96 the orbit",
    "is supposed to lie at large distance , thus the first root will not occur .    using the above results , a parameter @xmath15 generalizing the eccentric anomaly of the kepler orbits",
    "is readily introduced : @xmath97 such that @xmath98 is at @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively . from here : @xmath101 for equatorial orbits , this parametrization has been employed by shibata@xcite .",
    "expressing @xmath102 from ( [ radial ] ) and linearizing in @xmath0 , the expression for @xmath103 is found : @xmath104    integration of ( [ txi ] ) from 0 to @xmath105 gives the orbital period : @xmath106    however the parametrization ( [ eq : xi ] ) is inconvenient for carrying out the averaging of the losses , because it yields a complicated array of poles of the integrands .",
    "hence in the sequel we will , in place of ( [ xi ] ) , find a parametrization @xmath107 satisfying the following two criteria : @xmath108 where @xmath109 are constants .",

    "the orientation of the momentary ellipse of the orbit is reinterpreted at each revolution , and the value of the integration constant is subject to a corresponding shift .",
    "our parametrization ( [ chi ] ) makes especially simple the integration over one period of all expressions @xmath117 containing in the denominator no @xmath70 dependence and no other @xmath13 dependence than @xmath118 , with @xmath119 a positive integer .",
    "note that ( [ omegal ] ) , ( [ psit ] ) and ( [ phit ] ) have this property .",

    "the value of the integral is given by the sum of the residues of the poles inside the circle .",
    "in all relevant cases our parametrization assures that the only pole is at @xmath126 .",
    "simple examples are the integrations of ( [ phit ] ) , ( [ psit ] ) and ( [ omegal ] ) : @xmath127 here ( [ dephi ] ) is the precession angle of the orbital angular momentum @xmath128 about @xmath7 .",
    "the interpretation of the variable @xmath70 as the polar angle in the plane perpendicular to @xmath41 is in accordance with the identical first order terms in ( [ eq : depsi ] ) and ( [ eq : shift ] ) .",

    "<S> this is achieved by two improvements over the existing descriptions . </S>",
    "<S> first , by introducing new angle variables with a straightforward geometrical meaning . </S>",
    "<S> second , by finding a new parametrization of a generic orbit , which assures that the integration over a radial period can be done in an especially simple way , by applying the residue theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the instantaneous gravitational radiation losses of the system are computed using the formulation of _ blanchet , damour and iyer(1989)_. all losses are given both in terms of the dynamical constants of motion and the properly defined orbital elements @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the radiative losses of the constants characterizing the lense - thirring motion , when suitably converted , are in agreement with earlier results of _ kidder , will and wiseman(1993 ) , ryan(1996 ) and shibata(1994)_. in addition , the radiative losses of two slowly changing orbital elements @xmath3 are given in order to complete the characterization of the orbit .    </S>",
