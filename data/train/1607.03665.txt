    "_ full - duplex _ ( fd ) communications have achieved more and more attentions because of the potential to double the wireless link capacity@xcite . with the current _ self - interference _ ( si ) cancellation techniques , such as propagation domain suppression , analog cancellation , and digital cancellation , si can be mitigated to a sufficiently low level , to make the fd communications practically implementable .",
    "recently , there has been some work in facilitating the application of fd enabled cellular networks from the perspective of enhancing _ spectral - efficiency _ ( se ) @xcite .    since power consumption of mobile devices is increasing rapidly whereas the battery capacity is still limited , _ energy - efficiency _",
    "( ee ) becomes a more and more important metric for cellular networks .",
    "the ee design of wireless systems has been investigated since a decade ago .",
    "it is well known that the ee and se can not be simultaneously optimized in general , especially when the circuit power consumption is considered .",
    "the ee - se tradeoff in downlink ofdma networks has been initially studied in @xcite . for ofdma networks ,",
    "ee is a quasi - concave function of se .",
    "the quasi - concavity of the ee - se relation has also been extended into other systems , such as the amplify - and - forward relay network @xcite , the type - i arq system @xcite , and the cognitive radio network @xcite .",
    "however , the ee - se tradeoff of the fd enabled network has not been addressed yet .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the ee - se relation in fd enabled networks where small cell _ base stations _",
    "( bss ) are working in the fd mode while user devices work in the conventional _ half - duplex _ ( hd ) mode .",
    "the main challenge here is to deal with both si and _ co - channel interference _ (",
    "cci ) , which render it difficult to analyze the ee - se tradeoff .",
    "we first find a necessary condition for fd communications to outperform the conventional hd communications in term of ee - se tradeoff when the _ residual si _",
    "( rsi ) power is constant as in @xcite .",
    "then , the closed - form expression of the ee - se tradeoff is found and the ee is proved to be a quasi - concave function of the se when considering only one pair of users .",
    "moreover , the quasi - concavity is further extended to the multi - user scenario .",
    "based on the quasi - concavity , the optimal algorithm is developed to achieve the maximum ee for a given se region , which contains two loops .",

    ", we analyze the ee - se relation for a single pair of users . in section",
    "v , we extend our study to the multi - user scenario and propose an optimal algorithm to maximize ee for a given se region .",
    "numerical results are presented in section vi and the whole paper is concluded in section vii .",
    "in this section , we introduce the system model and then formulate the ee - se tradeoff problem .      as depicted in fig .",
    "[ sysmodel ] , we consider a _ time - division _ ( td ) single picocell network with the _ small bs _ ( sbs ) located at the center of the cell .",
    "the sbs is fd enabled whereas the user devices still work in the conventional hd mode due to their limited hardware capability of si cancellation .",
    "when the sbs is in fd mode , an uplink user and a downlink user can be paired to communicate simultaneously . at the same time ,",
    "two kinds of interference are consequently incurred : si at the sbs affecting the uplink transmission and cci affecting the downlink transmission . in this paper , we assume that the rsi power after si cancellation is a constant , which can be known to the sbs in advance @xcite .        as in fig .",
    "[ sysmodel ] , denote @xmath0 as the uplink _ carrier - to - noise ratio _ ( cnr ) of user @xmath1 , which can be expressed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the path loss constant",
    ", @xmath4 is the fading coefficient , @xmath5 is the distance from the user @xmath1 to the sbs , @xmath6 is the path loss exponent , and @xmath7 is the power of the _ additive white gaussian noise _ ( awgn ) . in the sequel , for notation simplicity and without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath7 is normalized according to the transmit power , i.e. , @xmath8 . similarly , we can define @xmath9 as the downlink cnr of user @xmath10 and @xmath11 as the cci cnr from uplink user @xmath1 to downlink user @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that the sbs can acquire the instantaneous _ channel state information _ ( csi ) of all involved links to perform centralized resource allocation .",
    "consider a picocell with @xmath12 pairs of users .",
    "as in fig .",
    "[ sysmodel ] , uplink user @xmath1 and downlink user @xmath10 are assumed to be paired , i.e. , they communicate simultaneously . in this case , the achievable uplink and downlink data rates can be expressed as @xmath13 respectively , where @xmath14 is the system bandwidth , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the uplink and downlink transmit powers , respectively , and @xmath17 is the normalized rsi power .",

    "therefore , in this network , the ee - se tradeoff problem can be formulated as maximizing the ee for a given se .",

    "first , the ee - se tradeoff comparison between fd communications and hd communications is analyzed and a necessary condition for fd communications to be better than hd communications is derived . then , the ee - se tradeoff problem in the scenario of single pair of users is investigated to get some insights . in this scenario ,",
    "ee is proved to be a quasi - concave function of se .",
    "next , we will show that ee is also quasi - concave on se even in the multi - user scenario and hence a global optimal solution can be developed .",
    "before investigating the ee - se tradeoff problem for fd enabled networks , it is important to understand in which case fd communications are better than hd communications . in this section , a necessary condition for fd communications to be better than hd communications is found .",
    "denote @xmath29 and @xmath30 as the transmit powers of fd mode and hd mode , respectively .",
    "denote @xmath31 and @xmath32 as the data rate of fd mode and hd mode , respectively .",
    "then , we have @xmath33    the ee comparison problem between fd communications and hd communications can be formulated as comparing the ee with the same se , that is , compare @xmath34 when @xmath35 .    by comparing @xmath36 and @xmath37 for same se ,",
    "a necessary condition can be derived , as presented in the following theorem and proved in appendix a.    if fd communications have a better ee - se tradeoff than hd communications , the following condition must be satisfied",
    ". @xmath38    from theorem 1 , we have the following intuitive but insightful observations .    *",
    "if the cnr of the cci link , @xmath39 , is greater than a threshold , i.e. , @xmath40 , hd communications will have a better ee - se tradeoff than fd communications . *",
    "the fd communications would have a better ee - se tradeoff than the hd communications only if @xmath17 is less than a threshold , @xmath41 .",
    "otherwise , hd mode should be used due to the large rsi power .    note",
    "that although in theorem 1 is not a sufficient condition , it is close to the sufficient condition especially when the uplink cnr is close to the downlink cnr and the transmit power is small , as explained in appendix a. nevertheless , will be used as the pre - condition where the fd mode should be used in the sequel .",
    "in this section , we start with the scenario of single pair of users to gain some insights of the ee - se tradeoff . in this case , transmit power allocation can be expressed in a closed - form . moreover",
    ", the maximum ee , @xmath42 , in this case can be proved to be a quasi - concave function of se , and therefore the global optimal ee can be achieved for any given se region .    for a given user pair @xmath21 , the ee - se tradeoff problem in can be simplified into @xmath43    [ eq:3 ] subject to + @xmath44    obviously , for a given @xmath18 , the solution to remains the same when the objective function is replaced by @xmath45 , since the other parameters are constants .",
    "therefore , we first analyze the minimum transmit power @xmath46 and then investigate the relation between @xmath47 and @xmath18 .    by applying some simple mathematical derivations ,",
    "the constraint in can be rewritten into @xmath48+(1+\\chi)p_{ij}^{\\rm{d}}h_j^{\\rm{d}}+(1-a)(1+\\chi)=0 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 .",

    "we now come up with the following theorem , as proved in appendix c.    the maximum ee , @xmath47 is a quasi - concave function of the se , @xmath63 , in the scenario of single pair of users .    in @xcite ,",
    "the quasi - concavity of ee - se relation has also been demonstrated in downlink ofdma networks with hd communications .",
    "however , different from the conventional hd networks , the fd network has two additional kinds of interference : si and cci . besides , the uplink transmission and the downlink transmission are coupled , which makes the ee - se tradeoff problem in fd networks more complicated than in hd networks .",
    "theorem 3 shows that , under such complicate cases , the ee is still a quasi - concave function of the se in the scenario of single pair of users .",
    "therefore , the optimal ee can be achieved for any given se region . in the next section",

    "in this section , we investigate the ee - se tradeoff in the multi - user scenario .",
    "we also show that the ee is a quasi - concave function of the se in this case . based on the quasi - convexity ,",
    "the global optimal algorithm to achieve the maximum ee for a given se region will be developed .",

    "substituting @xmath68 into leads to a non - convex optimization problem due to the non - convexity of @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in the following",
    ", we will first transform the problem into a convex one .",
    "we define an auxiliary variable as @xmath71 then , by substituting it into , the ee maximization problem can be transformed into @xmath72    [ eq:10 ] subject to + @xmath73    which is convex with regard to the variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 when @xmath76 $ ] , as proved in appendix d.    based on the convexity of the ee maximization problem in , we further show that the ee is a quasi - concave function of the se , as presented in the following theorem .    the optimal ee , @xmath47 , is a quasi - concave function of the se , @xmath77 , in the scenario of multiple user pairs .",
    "the proof is similar to that of theorem 3 .",
    "therefore , the global optimum ee , @xmath78 , can be achieved for any given se region , as elaborated in the following .    * _ the inner loop : _ for a fixed se , i.e , @xmath18 , solve the convex problem in to obtain @xmath47 .",
