    "the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is a state of deconfined nuclear matter formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "one of the promising proposed probes to study such a state is the suppression of heavy quarkonia ( bound states of @xmath6  and @xmath7   pairs ) via debye screening @xcite . due to their large mass",
    ", the pair creation of heavy quarks occurs in the initial partonic stage of the collision , thus enabling them to experience the entire history of the collision . without any cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effect , the total production cross - section of these pairs in nuclear collisions should correspond to the one in nucleon - nucleon collisions scaled with the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "it is expected that the production probabilities of quarkonium states are affected by the hot and dense qgp which makes them a sensitive tool for its properties . at the lower collision energies from sps and rhic , a strong j@xmath0  suppression is observed .",
    "however , the interpretation of these results is still under debate due to insufficient understanding of the cnm effects which break the @xmath8 scaling . it is expected that the measurements in pb ",
    "pb collisions at lhc energies will shed more light on this subject .",
    "shadowing , the modification of the free nucleon gluon distribution functions , is the dominant contribution to the cnm effects at lhc energies and will be measured in p - pb collisions .    in these proceedings",
    "we report on measurements of the inclusive j@xmath0  production as a function of centrality , transverse momentum ( @xmath9 ) and rapidity ( @xmath10 ) in pb  pb  collisions at @xmath1=2.76  tev recorded using the alice setup during the 2010 and 2011 runs .",
    "the results are presented using the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath5 ) which is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the inclusive j@xmath0  cross - sections in pb ",
    "pb  and pp collisions , respectively .",
    "@xmath8 is obtained using glauber model calculations .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "to summarize , we reported on the latest alice measurements of the inclusive j@xmath0  nuclear modification factor as a function of centrality , @xmath9  and @xmath10 in pb ",
    "pb  collisions at @xmath1=2.76  tev . in the most central collisions",
    "our integrated @xmath5  values are roughly 3 times higher than the results obtained in central au ",
    "au collisions by phenix collaboration .",
    "model calculations which incorporate the ( re)generation mechanism are in agreement with the data",
    ". better knowledge of the total charm cross - section and the cnm effects will impose more stringent constraints to models .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath9dependence of the j@xmath0  @xmath5  in central collisions indicates that the ( re)generation mechanism is significant at low transverse momentum .",
    "finally , the j@xmath0  @xmath5  in central collisions is decreasing with increasing rapidity as was also observed at rhic .",
