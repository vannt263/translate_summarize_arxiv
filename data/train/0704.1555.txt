    "the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process @xcite is the simplest model of non - equilibrium systems of interacting self - driven particles .",
    "various extensions of this model have been reported in the last few years for capturing the essential features of the collective spatio - temporal organizations in wide varieties of systems , including those in vehicular traffic @xcite .",
    "traffic of buses and bicycles have also been modeled following similar approaches @xcite . a simple bus route model @xcite exhibits clustering of the buses along the route and the quantitative features of the coarsening of the clusters have strong similarities with coarsening phenomena in many other physical systems . under normal circumstances ,",
    "such clustering of buses is undesirable in any real bus route as the efficiency of the transport system is adversely affected by clustering .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to introduce a traffic control system into the bus route model in such a way that helps in suppressing this tendency of clustering of the buses .",
    "this new model exhibits a competition between the two opposing tendencies of clustering and de - clustering which is interesting from the point of view of fundamental physical principles .",
    "however , the model may also find application in developing adaptive traffic control systems for public conveyance systems .    in some of earlier bus - route models , movement of the buses",
    "was monitored on coarse time intervals so that the details of the dynamics of the buses in between two successive bus stops was not described explicitly . instead",
    ", the movement of the bus from one stop to the next was captured only through probabilities of hopping from one stop to the next ; hopping takes place with the lower probability if passengers are waiting at the approaching bus stop @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the model is as follows : the passengers could board the bus whenever and wherever they stopped a bus by raising their hand , this is called the _ hail - and - ride _ system .    several possible extensions of the bus route model have been reported in the past @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite , in order to elucidate the connection between the bus route model with parallel updating and the nagel - schreckenberg model , two alternative extensions of the latter model with space-/time - dependent hopping rates are proposed .",
    "if a bus does not stop at a bus stop , the waiting passengers have to wait further for the next bus ; such scenarios were captured in one of the earlier bus route models @xcite , using modified car - following model . in @xcite , the bus capacity , as well as the number of passengers getting on and off at each stop , were introduced to make the model more realistic .",
    "interestingly , it has been claimed that the distribution of the time gaps between the arrival of successive buses is described well by the gaussian unitary ensemble of random matrices @xcite .    in this paper , by extending the model in @xcite , we suggest a new public conveyance model ( pcm ) . although we refer to each of the public vehicles in this model as a `` bus '' , the model is equally applicable to train traffic on a given route . in this pcm",
    "we can set up arbitrary number of bus stops on the given route .",
    "the _ hail - and - ride _ system turns out to be a special case of the general pcm .",
    "moreover , in the pcm the duration of the halt of a bus at any arbitrary bus stop depends on the number of waiting passengers .",
    "as we shall demonstrate in this paper , the delay in the departure of the buses from crowded bus stops leads to the tendency of the buses to cluster on the route .",
    "furthermore , in the pcm , we also introduce a traffic control system that exploits the information on the number of buses in the `` segments '' in between successive bus stops ; this traffic control system helps in reducing the undesirable tendency of clustering by dispersing the buses more or less uniformly along the route .    in this study",
    "we introduce two different quantitative measures of the efficiency of the bus transport system , and calculate these quantities , both numerically and analytically , to determine the conditions under which the system would operate optimally .",
    "this paper is organized as follows , in sec .",
    "@xmath0 pcm is introduced and we show several simulation results in sec .",
    "the average speed and the number of waiting passengers are studied by mean field analysis in sec .",
    "@xmath2 , and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in this section , we explain the pcm in detail . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions .",
    "let us imagine that the road is partitioned into @xmath4 identical cells such that each cell can accommodate at most one bus at a time .",
    "moreover , a total of @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) _ equispaced _ cells are identified in the beginning as bus stops .",
    "note that , the special case @xmath7 corresponds to the _ hail - and - ride _ system . at any given time step ,",
    "a passenger arrives with probability @xmath8 to the system . here",
    ", we assume that a given passenger is equally likely to arrive at any one of the bus stops with a probability @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the average number of passengers that arrive at each bus stop per unit time is given by @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast to this model , in ref .  @xcite the passengers were assumed to arrive with probability @xmath8 at all the bus stops in every time step .",
    "the model a corresponds to those situations where , because of sufficiently large number of broad doors , the time interval during which the doors of the bus remain open after halting at a stop , is independent of the size of waiting crowd of passengers .",
    "in contrast , the model b captures those situations where a bus has to halt for a longer period to pick up a larger crowd of waiting passengers .    the symbol @xmath11 is used to denote the hopping probability of a bus entering into a cell that has been designated as a bus stop .",
    "we consider two different forms of @xmath11 in the two versions of our model which are named as model a and model b. in the model a we assume the form @xmath12 where both @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are constants independent of the number of waiting passengers .",
    "the form ( [ ant ] ) was used in the original formulation of the bus route model by oloan et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in contrast to most of all the earlier bus route models , we assume in the model b that the maximum number of passengers that can get into one bus at a bus stop is @xmath16 .",
    "suppose , @xmath17 denotes the number of passengers waiting at the bus stop @xmath18 @xmath19 at the instant of time when a bus arrives there .",
    "in contrast to the form ( [ ant ] ) for @xmath11 in model a , we assume in model b the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of passengers who can get into a bus which arrives at the bus stop @xmath18 at the instant of time when the number of passengers waiting there is @xmath17 .",
    "the form ( [ wait ] ) is motivated by the common expectation that the time needed for the passengers boarding a bus is proportional to their number .",
    "@xmath22 depicts the hopping probabilities in the two models a and b schematically .",
    "the hopping probability of a bus to the cells that are not designated as bus stops is @xmath13 ; this is already captured by the expressions ( [ ant ] ) and ( [ wait ] ) since no passenger ever waits at those locations .    in principle , the hopping probability @xmath11 for a real bus would depend also on the number of passengers who get off at the bus stop ; in the extreme situations where no passenger waits at a bus stop the hopping probability @xmath11 would be solely decided by the disembarking passengers .",
    "however , in order to keep the model theoretically simple and tractable , we ignore the latter situation and assume that passengers get off only at those stops where waiting passengers get into the bus and that the time taken by the waiting passengers to get into the bus is always adequate for the disembarking passengers to get off the bus .    note that @xmath16 is the _ maximum boarding capacity _ at each bus stop rather than the _ maximum carrying capacity _ of each bus . the pcm model reported here can be easily extended to incorporate an additional dynamical variable associated with each bus to account for the instantaneous number of passengers in it .",
    "but , for the sake of simplicity , such an extension of the model is not reported here . instead , in the simple version of the pcm model reported here",
    ", @xmath16 can be interpreted as the maximum carrying capacity of each bus if we assume that all of the passengers on the bus get off whenever it stops .",

    "+ if the cell in front of a bus is not occupied by another bus , each bus hops to the next cell with the probability @xmath11 .",
    "specifically , if passengers do not exist in the next cell in both model a and model b hopping probability equals to @xmath13 because @xmath17 equals to 0 .",
    "else , if passengers exist in the next cell , the hopping probability equals to @xmath14 in the model a , whereas in the model b the corresponding hopping probability equals to @xmath27 .",
    "note that , when a bus is loaded with passengers to its maximum boarding capacity @xmath16 , the hopping probability in the model b equals to @xmath28 , the smallest allowed hopping probability .",
    "3 .   _ boarding a bus _ + when a bus arrives at the @xmath18-th ( @xmath24 ) bus stop cell , the corresponding number @xmath17 of waiting passengers is updated to @xmath29 to account for the passengers boarding the bus .",
    "once the door is closed , no more waiting passenger can get into the bus at the same bus stop although the bus may remain stranded at the same stop for a longer period of time either because of the unavailability of the next bus stop or because of the traffic control rule explained next .",
    "_ bus information update _ + every bus stop has information @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) which is the number of buses in the segment of the route between the stop @xmath32 and the next stop @xmath33 at that instant of time .",

    "the desirable value of @xmath30 is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the total number of buses , for all @xmath32 so that buses are not clustered in any segment of the route .",

    "if the density of the buses is higher than optimal , the mutual hindrance created by the buses in the overcrowded route also lowers the efficiency of the transport system .",
    "moreover , we have found that the average velocity increases , and the number of waiting passengers decreases , when the information - based bus traffic control system is switched on . however , this enhancement of efficiency of the conveyance system takes place only over a particular range of density",
    "; the information - based bus traffic control system does not necessarily improve the efficiency of the system in all possible situations .",
    "we have compared two situations where the second situation is obtained from the first one by doubling the carrying capacity of each bus and reducing their number to half the original number on the same route . in the density region",
    "@xmath112 the system of @xmath43 is more efficient than that with @xmath66 .",
    "however , at small densities ( @xmath113 ) , although the average velocity increases , the number of waiting passengers also increases , by doubling the carrying capacity from @xmath43 to @xmath114 .",
    "hence , bus - transport system administrators would face a dilemma in this region of small density .",
    "finally , in our pcm , the effect of the disembarking passengers on the halt time of the buses has not been captured explicitly . moreover ,",
    "this study is restricted to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the clustering of particles occurs not only in a ring - like bus route , but also in shuttle services of buses and trains .",
    "thus it would be interesting to investigate the effects of the information - based traffic control system also on such public transport systems . in a future work",
    ", we intend to report the results of our investigations of the model under non - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we hope our model will help in understanding the mechanism of congestion in public conveyance system and will provide insight as to the possible ways to reduce undesirable clustering of the vehicles ."
