    "nowadays , there is a growing interest in the combinatorial properties of convex sets , usually , in compact convex sets .",
    "a large part of the papers belonging to this field go back to erds and szekeres  @xcite ; see , for example , dobbins , holmsen , and hubard  @xcite and @xcite , pach and tth  @xcite and @xcite , and their references . recently , besides combinatorists and geometers , algebraists are also interested in compact convex sets ; see , for example , adaricheva  @xcite , adaricheva and bolat  @xcite , adaricheva and nation  @xcite , czdli  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , czdli and kincses  @xcite , and richter and rogers  @xcite .",
    "the interest of algebraists is explained by the fact that _ antimatroids _ , introduced by korte and lovsz  @xcite and @xcite , and the dual concept of _ abstract convex geometries _ , introduced by edelman and jamison  @xcite , have close connections to lattice theory .",
    "these connections are surveyed in adaricheva and czdli  @xcite , adaricheva and nation  @xcite , czdli  @xcite , and monjardet  @xcite .",
    "finally , there are other types of combinatorial investigations of convex sets ; the most recent is , perhaps , novick  @xcite .",
    "one of the most important concepts related to planar convex sets is that of _ supporting lines_. most of the papers mentioned above rely , explicitly or implicitly , on the properties of these lines .",
    "we guess that not only the experts of advanced analysis of convex sets and functions are interested in the above papers ; at least , this is surely true in case of the first author of the present paper .",
    "however , it is quite difficult to explain to or understand by all the interested readers in a short , easy - to - follow , but rigorous way that why one of the most useful property of compact convex sets holds .",
    "this property , which seems to be absent in the literature , will be formulated in theorem  [ thmmain ] .",
    "this theorem is the `` note '' occurring in the title .",
    "this motivates the aim of this short paper : even if theorem  [ thmmain ] could be proved in a shorter way by using advanced tools of analysis and even if it states what is expected by geometric intuition , we are going to give a rigorous proof for it . actually , we give two different proofs .",
    "we believe that if other statements for planar compact convex sets like deserve proofs that are easy to reference , then so does this theorem .",
    "note that czdli  @xcite exemplifies why the present paper is expected to be useful in further research : while the first version , arxiv:1611.09331v1 , of @xcite spends a dozen of pages on properties of supporting lines , its second version needs only few lines and a reference to the present paper .",
    "also , we exemplify the use of theorem  [ thmmain ] by an easy corollary , which is a well known but we have not found a rigorous proof for it .",
    "a _ compact _ subset of the plane @xmath0 is a topologically closed bounded subset .",
    "the _ boundary _ of @xmath1 will be denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "a subset @xmath1 of @xmath0 is _ convex _ , if for any two points @xmath3 , the closed line segment @xmath4 $ ] is a subset of @xmath1 . in this section , @xmath1 will stand for a compact convex set .",
    "even if this is not always repeated , we always assume that a convex set is nonempty .",
    "each line @xmath5 gives rise to two _ closed halfplanes _ ; their intersection is @xmath5 . usually ,",
    "unless otherwise is stated explicitly , we assume that @xmath5 is a _ directed line _ ; then we can speak of the _ left and right halfplanes _ determined by @xmath5 .",
    "points or set in the left halfplane are _ on the left _ of @xmath5 ; being on the right is defined analogously . if @xmath1 is on the left of @xmath5 such that @xmath6 , then @xmath1 is _ strictly on the left _ of @xmath5 .",
    "the _ direction _ of a directed line @xmath5 will be denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "it is understood modulo @xmath8 , whence we could also consider @xmath9 an element of @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , denoting the unit circle @xmath11 by @xmath12 , we will often say that @xmath13 . following the convention of yaglom and boltyanski@xmath14  @xcite ,",
    "if @xmath1 is on the left of @xmath5 and @xmath15 , then @xmath5 is a _ supporting line _ of @xmath1 . clearly , for a supporting line @xmath5 of @xmath1 , @xmath16 .",
    "we know from yaglom and boltyanski@xmath14  @xcite that parallel to each line @xmath5 , a compact convex set with nonempty interior has exactly two supporting lines .",
    "hence , without any stipulation on the interior , @xmath17 note at this point that , by definition , a _",
    "curve _ is the range @xmath18 of a continuous function @xmath19 from an interval @xmath20 of positive length to @xmath21 for some @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath23 except possibly for the endpoints of @xmath20 , then @xmath18 is a _",
    "simple curve_. a _ jordan curve _ is a homeomorphic _ planar _ image of a circle of nonzero radius , that is , a jordan curve is a _ simple closed curve in the plane_. a curve is _ rectifiable _ if the lengths of its inscribed polygons form a bounded subset of @xmath24 .",
    "the following statement is known , say , from latecki , rosenfeld , and silverman  ( * ? ? ?",
    "32 ) and topogonov  @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "@xmath25    for @xmath26 , there are two possibilities ; see , for example , yaglom and boltyanski@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "first , if there is exactly one supporting line through @xmath27 , @xmath28 second , if there are at least two distinct supporting lines @xmath29 and @xmath30 through @xmath27 , then @xmath27 is a _ corner _ of @xmath2 ( or of @xmath1 ) . in both cases , a supporting line @xmath5 containing @xmath27",
    "is called the _ last semitangent _ of @xmath1 through @xmath27 if for every small positive @xmath31 , there is an @xmath32 such that the line obtained from @xmath5 by rotating it around @xmath27 _ forward _ ( that is , counterclockwise ) by @xmath33 degree is not a supporting line .",
    "the _ first semitangent _ is defined similarly .",
    "the first and the last semitangents coincide iff @xmath34 is a regular point . for @xmath26 , @xmath35 let us emphasize that no matter if @xmath26 is a regular point or a vertex , @xmath36 besides yaglom and boltyanski@xmath14  @xcite , this folkloric fact is also included , say , in boyd and vanderberghe @xcite . we note but will not use the fact that every line separating @xmath27 and the interior of @xmath1 is a supporting line through @xmath27 . as an illustration for , some supporting lines of @xmath1 are given in figure  [ figglide ] . if @xmath37 is the supporting line denoted by @xmath38 in the figure , then @xmath39 is a tangent line , @xmath40 is the first semitangent through @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the last semitangent through the same point .",
    "we know from , say , borwein and vanderwerff  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in page 42 ) , yaglom and boltyanski@xmath14  @xcite , or even from @xcite , that the boundary @xmath2 of a compact convex set @xmath43 can have @xmath44 many corners .",
    "this possibility , which is not so easy to imagine , also justifies that we are going to give a rigorous proof for our theorem .",
    "next , restricting ourselves to the compact case and to the plane , we recall the _ strict separation theorem _ as follows .",
    "@xmath45 this result follows , for example , from subsection 2.5.1 in boyd and vandenberghe  @xcite plus the fact that the _ distance _ @xmath46 of @xmath47 and @xmath48 is positive in this case .    ]",
    "given a compact convex set @xmath1 , visual intuition tells us that any supporting line can be continuously transformed to any other supporting line .",
    "we think of this transformation as a _",
    ", _ continuous _ progression in time .",
    "for example , in figure  [ figglide ] , @xmath49 comes , after some time , later than @xmath37 , for @xmath50 . while continuity makes a well - known mathematical sense , a comment on slowness is appropriate here . by _ slowness _",
    "we shall mean rectifiability , because this is what guarantees that running the process with a constant speed , it will terminate .",
    "therefore , since rectifiability is an adjective of curves , we are going to associate a simple closed rectifiable curve with @xmath1 such that the progression is described by moving along this curve forward .",
    "the only problem with this initial idea is that , say , @xmath51 can not follow @xmath52 , because they are the same supporting lines .",
    "therefore , we consider pointed supporting lines .",
    "a _ pointed supporting line _",
    "of @xmath1 is a pair @xmath53 such that @xmath34 and @xmath5 is a supporting line of @xmath1 through @xmath27 .",
    "the transition from @xmath37 to @xmath49 will be called _ slide - turning_. of course , the @xmath54 , for @xmath55 , represent only twelve snapshots of a continuous progression . in order to capture the progression mathematically , note that each pointed supporting line @xmath53 of @xmath1 is determined uniquely by the point @xmath56 . to be more precise , define the following  _ cylinder _ @xmath57 as the crucial concept of this section , the _ slide curve _ of @xmath1 is @xmath58 it is a subset of @xmath59 .",
    "although @xmath60 looks only a set at present , it will soon turn out that it is a curve .",
    "actually , the main result of the paper says the following .",
    "[ thmmain ] for every nonempty compact convex set @xmath61 , @xmath60 is a _",
    "rectifiable _ simple closed curve .    in order to exemplify the usefulness of this theorem",
    ", we state a corollary .",
    "although it is well known , we have not found a rigorous proof for it .",
    "[ corolfourtl ] if @xmath62 are disjoint compact convex sets with nonempty interiors , then they have exactly four non - directed supporting lines in common .",
    "the stipulation on the interior above can be relaxed but then we have to speak of _ directed _ supporting lines .    ]",
    "we can assume that the interior of @xmath1 is nonempty , because otherwise @xmath1 is a line segment , possibly a singleton segment , and the statement trivially holds . in order to reduce the task to functions rather than convex sets ,",
    "let @xmath63 be an arbitrary point of @xmath2 .",
    "pick a point @xmath64 in the interior of @xmath1 , and choose a coordinate system such that both @xmath63 and @xmath64 are on the @xmath65-axis and @xmath64 is above @xmath63 ; see on the left of figure  [ figrdtfncts ] . for a positive @xmath66 ,",
    "let @xmath67 and @xmath68 be the circles of radii @xmath66 and @xmath69 around @xmath64 ; we can assume that @xmath66 is so small that @xmath68 is in the interior of @xmath1 .",

    "( we have some freedom to choose the upper and lower edges of this rectangle . )",

    "this contradiction shows that @xmath83 is a function .",
    "it is convex , since so is @xmath1 .",
    "this proves .",
    "clearly , the same consideration shows that @xmath84    next , recall from , say , niculescu and persson @xcite that for a real - valued function @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the interior of its domain , the left derivative @xmath87 and the right derivative of @xmath83 at @xmath86 are denoted by @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively . by a theorem of stolz  @xcite ,",
