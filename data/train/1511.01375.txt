    "this paper presents our explanation of the results obtained at the lcls @xcite in a recent experiment presented at the fel2015 conference @xcite .",
    "this experiment apparently demonstrated that after a microbunched electron beam is kicked on a large angle compared to the divergence of the fel radiation pulse , the microbunching wavefront is readjusted along the new direction of motion of the kicked beam .",
    "there is a reason for arguing that this picture can not be explained in the framework of classical mechanics . if this is correct , then we are inclined to say that there must be something wrong with the classical particle tracking model",
    ". however , we will see that there is nothing wrong with it . here",
    "we try to convey the idea that the difference between the directions of the electron motion and of the normal to the microbunching wavefront after the kick , as predicted by particle tracking , is not in contradiction with the deflection ( of the same angle as the electron beam ) without suppression of the radiation in the downstream undulator , which occurs in the experiment .",
    "let us discuss the experimental results described in reference @xcite . a well - known result of classical particle tracking states that after the electron beam is kicked there is a change in the trajectory of the electron beam , while the orientation of the microbunching wavefront remains as before , see fig .",
    "[ qmclass ] ( left ) . in other words ,",
    "the kick results in a difference between the directions of the electron motion and of the normal to the microbunching wavefront @xcite . in xfel simulations",
    "it is generally accepted that coherent radiation from an undulator placed after the kicker is emitted along the normal to the microbunching wavefront .",
    "therefore , when the angular kick exceeds the divergence of the output radiation , emission in the direction of the electron motion is suppressed @xcite .",
    "the experiment @xcite showed the surprising effect that radiation in the kicked direction is produced practically without suppression .",
    "this fact could be explained if , in contrast with the conventional understanding @xcite , the microbunching orientation is readjusted along the new direction of the electron beam , see fig [ qmclass ] ( right ) .",
    "the experimental result is apparently at odds with the prediction from particle tracking .",
    "therefore , the question arises about how to explain the coherent undulator radiation that occurs in nature and whether or not a phenomenon like deflection of coherent undulator radiation by a dipole magnet can be described in the framework of classical mechanics and electrodynamics .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that there is no ` wavefront readjusting ' phenomenon . in the laboratory frame , due to the kick , electrons move with a uniform transverse velocity component along the direction of the microbunching wavefront , like in fig .",
    "[ qmclass ] ( left ) , while the radiation beam is deflected .",
    "the effect of aberration of light @xcite supplies the basis for an understanding of this phenomenon .",
    "let us summarize the experimental results described in reference @xcite .",
    "the lcls generates linearly polarized x - ray pulses from a planar undulator .",
    "a @xmath2 m - long delta undulator , which allows for a full control of the degree of polarization of the emitted radiation , was recently installed in place of the last lcls undulator segment . before going through the delta undulator ,",
    "the electron beam is microbunched in the preceding planar undulator segments .",
    "this enhances the radiation power by several orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the delta undulator is said to be operating in ` afterburner configuration ' .",
    "such configuration leads to the presence of linearly - polarized background radiation from the main undulator , which should be suppressed .",
    "in fact , when the efficiency of the regular afterburner mode of operation was tested , a maximum contrast ratio of about @xmath3 was achieved .",
    "it has been recently proposed @xcite that the background radiation component can be greatly reduced by a reverse undulator tapering configuration . by inverting the sign of the baseline undulator tapering the radiation emission",
    "is reduced , while microbunching can still develop .",
    "the efficiency of this mode of operation was tested and a contrast ratio of about @xmath4 was reported in @xcite . under this conditions ,",
    "practically , at the entrance of the delta undulator there is only the micro - bunched beam .",
    "reference @xcite further reports a final improvement of the degree of polarization up to @xmath5 by x - ray beam splitting at the photon energy of @xmath6 kev .",
    "this was achieved by kicking the electron beam before entering the delta undulator , in order to let electron beam and background radiation pass through the delta undulator at different angles .",
    "the quadrupole at the end of the last planar undulator section includes a regular vertical corrector , which was used to control the magnitude of the kick .",
    "the maximal kick angle was about @xmath7 rad and was limited only by the @xmath8 mm diameter of the beamline aperture at the distance of 80 m. at this maximum angle , the separation between the two radiation spots on the screen in the experimental hall was about @xmath9 rms times the radiation spot size .",
    "the lcls experiment apparently shows that the microbunching orientation is readjusted to produce coherent radiation in the kicked direction : the energy of the output radiation pulse with and without kick is practically the same .",
    "however , classical particle tracking shows that while the electron beam direction changes after the kick , the orientation of the microbunching wavefront stays unvaried .",
    "therefore , the electron motion and the wavefront normal have different directions .",
    "figure [ classical ] illustrates the problem , which arises in classical treatments when a microbunched electron beam is deflected by a single dipole .",
    "the fel process in a downstream undulator is expected to be dramatically suppressed as soon as the kick angle is larger than the divergence of the output coherent radiation .        in order to estimate the loss of radiation efficiency we make the assumption that the spatial profile of the bunching factor is close to that of the electron beam and has a gaussian shape with standard deviation @xmath10 .",
    "a bunched electron beam in an fel amplifier can be considered as a sequence of periodically spaced oscillators .",
    "the radiation produced by these oscillators always interferes coherently at zero angle with respect to the undulator axis . in the limit for a small size of the electron beam",
    "the interference will be constructive within an angle of about @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the fel gain length . in the limit for a large size of the electron beam ,",
    "the angle of coherence is about @xmath13 instead .",
    "the boundary between these two asymptotes is for sizes of about @xmath14 .",
    "it is worth noting that the condition @xmath15 is satisfied in our case of study at the lcls .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the angular distribution of the radiation power in the far zone has a gaussian shape with standard deviation @xmath16 .",
    "after the electron beam is kicked , as already mentioned , in classical treatments we have a discrepancy between direction of the electron motion and wavefront normal . then",
    ", the radiation intensity along the new direction of the electron beam can be approximated as @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 is the on - axis intensity without kick and @xmath19 is the kick angle .",
    "the exponential suppression factor is due to the microbunching wavefront tilt with respect to the direction of motion of the electrons .",
    "let us now discuss the absence of detuning effects in the case of radiation emitted along the direction of the kick .",
    "the effective undulator period is now given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the actual undulator period .",
    "this induces a relative red shift in the resonance wavelength of about @xmath22 which should be compared with the relative bandwidth of the resonance , the @xmath23 parameter , which is much larger . as a result ,",
    "the red shift in the resonance wavelength due to the kick can be neglected in all situations of practical relevance .",
    "it is clear from the above that if a microbunched beam is at perfect resonance along the direction of motion without kick , then after the kick the same microbunched beam is at perfect resonance along the new direction of the electron beam motion .",
    "beam splitting at the lcls was done by kicking the electron beam of an angle of about @xmath9 standard deviations of the intensity distribution in the far zone . according to the estimations presented above",
    ", the intensity of the coherent radiation in the kicked direction should be suppressed by two orders of magnitude . in spite of this , the experiment showed that the radiation intensity in the kicked direction is practically the same as the intensity without kick at zero angle .",
    "this is in contradiction with the result in literature @xcite .",
    "our point is that reference @xcite misses a non - trivial , but very important kinematical effect in the description of coherent undulator radiation emitted by a modulated electron beam with an amplitude front tilt .",
    "we offer an explanation based on special relativity @xcite .",
    "the direction of a ray of light depends essentially on the velocity of the light source relative to the observer , a phenomenon commonly known as aberration .",
    "it is this phenomenon that was observed at the lcls beam splitting experiment .",
    "aberration of light is a shift of the direction of an incident beam of light due to the motion of the source relative to the observer .",
    "an elementary explanation of this effect is well - known @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is fully understandable in terms of transformation of velocities between different reference frames both in special relativity and in classical treatments .",
    "the aberration of light can also be easily explained on the basis of the corpuscular theory of light .",
    "this is plausible if one keeps in mind that a light signal represents a certain amount of electromagnetic energy .",
    "energy , like mass , is a quantity that is conserved , so that a light signal resembles , in many aspects , a material particle .",
    "therefore , we should expect that group velocities of light signals obey the same addition theorem for particle velocities .",
    "a closer treatment based on wave theory of light confirms this expectation .",
    ".,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    figure [ huy ] depicts a special case of vertical plane - wave emitter , formed by many elementary sources .",
    "all elementary sources flash simultaneously .",
    "a simple huygens construction shows that such emitter radiates a plane wavefront in the horizontal direction .",
    "however , the situation changes if the emitter moves at constant speed @xmath24 in the vertical direction , see fig .",
    "[ huy2 ] . in that case , due to the motion of the emitter , the elementary sources along it produce a linear phase chirp . as a consequence of this phase chirp ,",
    "the wavefront propagates at speed @xmath25 with an angle @xmath19 from the horizontal direction . in this way one obtains @xmath26",
    "this result can be explained purely phenomenologically on the basis of einstein s theorem for the addition of velocities .",
    "if @xmath24 is small compared to @xmath25 the formula for the aberration of light is reduced to the simpler form @xmath27 .",
    "aberration of light in terms of a classical theory based on ether differs with respect to the prediction of special relativity by terms of second and higher orders in @xmath28 .",
    "in other words , relativistic theory and classical theory agree only up to terms of first order in @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that if there is a microbunch front tilt is as in fig .",
    "[ qmclass ] ( left ) , then due to aberration effects the radiation wavefront is tilted to be orthogonal to the kicked direction , and one can not tell the difference with the case in fig .",
    "[ qmclass ] ( right ) .",
    "thus , aberration effects justify a completely novel standpoint : the front tilt of the mucrobunch has no definite objective meaning . the new experience gained from the accurate experiment at the lcls ,",
    "compel us to make a revision of kinematical concepts of beam physics .",
    "only a closer analysis of the concept of front tilt , i.e. a discussion of the methods by which a measurement of the front tilt can actually be performed , opens up the possibility of an unambiguous description of physical phenomena in accordance with the principle of relativity .",
    "generalizing further we are led to consider the idea that also the concept of simultaneity between two events in different places is , to some extent , conventional , because we can not give any experimental method by which simultaneity can be ascertained .",
    "the concept of microbunch front tilt , at least in the ultrarelativistic case , seems to be a particular illustration of this more general statement , because the microbunch front tilt is just a plane of simultaneous events , and no study of mucrobunching phenomena can ever lead to a determination of the influence of the kick .    as an illustration of this fact",
    ", we present a discussion on a non - trivial but important kinematical aspect of the kick influence associated with the so called ` smearing of microbunching ' phenomenon presented in @xcite . in section 2.4 the authors state : ` the finite angular spread of the electron beam results in a difference in time when each electron arrives at the same longitudinal position , and this spoils the phase coherence [ ... ]",
    "this is the so called debunching effect .",
    "the time difference is enhanced by the error [ kick ] angle [ ... ] , which leads to a significant degradation of the bunching factor .",
    "let us call this mechanism smearing of microbunching and distinguish from the normal debunching ' .",
    "the question here is whether or not we can observe this effect , and what measuring device can serve to this end .",
    "one should describe an operative procedure for observing the debunching effect .",
    "suppose that we measure the difference in energy between coherent undulator radiation emission as a function of undulator length in the cases with and without the microbunch front tilt .",
    "reference @xcite does not account for the effect of aberration . due to the motion of the electron beam along the microbunching front",
    ", the electrons along the microbunching front will induce a linear phase chirp onto the radiated field . in accordance with this phase chirp",
    "the electron beam will always propagate perpendicularly to the phase front of the radiation , and the smearing effect can not exist at all .",
    "our fruitless attempts to find any influence of the microbunch front tilt on the emission of coherent undulator radiation , confirmed by the lcls experiment , convinced us that this result has general validity and that the front tilt of the mucrobunching has no definite objective meaning .",
    "all physical phenomena will take the same course of development independently of the microbunch front tilt and one can never decide with an experiment which electron beam has a microbunch front tilt .",
    "all tilts become completely equivalent and a central requirement for a satisfactory physical theory of coherent emission is that all electron systems must be treated on the same footing .    in all treatments of vacuum - tube devices , one",
    "is continually concerned with the interaction of beams of electrons and electromagnetic fields , static or dynamic . in this class of problems",
    "one is ultimately interested in finding current and charge density at various points in space from the equation of motion of the particles and from the electromagnetic fields . in obtaining the current and charge densities from the motion of the particles ,",
    "one is essentially considering the electron beam as a fluid and is thus essentially applying hydrodynamical notions @xcite .    when treating hydrodynamical problems one can follow two equivalent approaches : lagrangian or eulerian . in the lagrangian approach one follows the motion of the individual charges through space .",
    "the variables of interest are the coordinates of the individual particles . in the eulerian approach , instead , one begins defining the charge density @xmath23 and the current density @xmath29 , i.e. particular field quantities , as a function of coordinates and time .",
    "one is no more interested in knowing the evolution of each single particle but only to observe charges passing through a given position , in order to obtain information about @xmath23 and @xmath29 .",
    "once these two fields are determined , one can solve maxwell s equations for the electric field , with @xmath23 and @xmath29 as macroscopic electromagnetic sources . in this method , the charge and current density must be considered as field variables , exactly like the electromagnetic field .",
    "the transformation from lagrangian to eulerian formulation is obtained by transforming the equations of motion .",
    "the acceleration of any particle that passes through a fixed point in space at a fixed time is related to the spatial and time derivatives of the velocity field by the well - known expression for the so - called particle : @xmath30 .",
    "the advantage of the eulerian approach is that one deals with field variables that are functions of space and time and one has a set of differential equations for these field variables .",
    "this set of equations includes the equation of continuity , expressed as @xmath31 .",
    "the problem of finding the coherent radiation in an undulator due to a fast , modulated electron beam moving with constant velocity @xmath32 can be solved most readily by taking advantage of fourier transformations .",
    "if the charge density of the electron fluid is transformed into a superposition of plane waves at different temporal frequencies , then the transformed equation of motion simply becomes @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the wave vector .",
    "taking the gradient with respect to @xmath34 we see that the group velocity is directed along the electron beam velocity as must be .",
    "when a modulated electron beam can be approximated with some accuracy by a monochromatic plane wave , its wave vector must be directed along the beam velocity , like in fig .",
    "[ qmclass ] ( right ) and equal in modulus to @xmath35 .",
    "this analysis leads to what , at first sight , seems to be a paradoxical conclusion : in the space - frequency domain , the microbunch front tilt does not exist at all .",
    "this seems in contrast with the results obtained using a lagrangian viewpoint , fig .",
    "[ qmclass ] ( left ) .",
    "however , as we have just seen , in that case one needs to include aberration effects in the treatment , thus finding the same result .",
    "in literature it became tradition to derive the effect of aberration of light using lorentz transformations .",
    "such an approach usually forces the reader to believe that a description of fel operation is impossible without a detailed knowledge of the special theory of relativity .",
    "we show below that the effect of aberration of light can be simply explained in the laboratory frame of reference and there is no need to use the laws of relativistic kinematics .",
    "when an electron can be treated as a point particle , such an approach always gives a reliable way to describe the processes of electron beam dynamics and radiation in given electromagnetic fields .",
    "as already discussed , we will focus on the description of an xfel source in terms of coherent elementary sources , the electrons , which are arranged in a modulated electron beam .",
    "we will be interested in the case of an ultra relativistic electron beam going through a certain magnetic system .",
    "we will discuss the undulator case to illustrate our reasoning , but the considerations in this section , being fully general , apply to any other magnetic system ( for instance a bending magnet ) as well .",
    "coherent undulator radiation theory is naturally developed in the space - frequency domain , as one is usually interested into radiation properties at a given position in space at a certain frequency . in this article",
    "we introduce the relation between temporal and frequency domain via the following definition of fourier transform pairs :    @xmath36    whatever the method used to present results , one needs to solve maxwell s equations in unbounded space .",
    "we introduce a cartesian coordinate system , where a point in space is identified by a longitudinal coordinate @xmath37 and transverse position @xmath38 .",
    "accounting for electromagnetic sources , i.e. in a region of space where current and charge densities are present , the following equation for the field in the space - frequency domain holds in all generality :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the fourier transforms of the charge density @xmath42 and of the current density @xmath43 .",

    "in other words , the initial condition for the function @xmath52 can be written as @xmath72 .",

    "recalling the eq .",

    "we can now see why the electron motion along the front of simultaneity gives an extra phase chirp , and we may now claim to understand the effect of aberration .",
    "indeed , we demonstrated mathematically that in the space - frequency domain the microbunch front tilt does not exist at all .",
    "we point out that the temporal fourier transform that we performed opens up the possibility of an unambiguous description of aberration phenomena without the need for the theory of relativity . from the standpoint of electrodynamic theory ,",

    "coherent radiation from a kicked modulated electron beam is a coherent collection of laser - like beams with different offsets and the same deflection .",

    "the foregoing microscopic analysis in the laboratory frame leads to the same conclusion as before : there is no kick influence on the radiation efficiency .",
    "let us review what we have found . in macroscopic electrodynamics",
    "one is always considering electrons that constitute the source of electromagnetic field as a fluid . in a hydrodynamical analysis of such electron fluid",
    "one may choose two approaches , one known as lagrangian , the other as eulerian .",
    "in the left part of fig . [ qmclass ] the evolution of the electron beam is described in the lagrangian formulation .",
    "this approach consists in ` labeling ' the particles , following them one by one , and calculating their contribution as they traverse various regions of the system .",
    "the variables of interest are the coordinates of the individual particles .",
    "downstream of the kicker one discusses about the microbunch front tilt , that is a plane of simultaneous events , and about the motion of the particles along this plane . in the right part of fig .",
    "[ qmclass ] the electron beam evolution is described , instead , according to the eulerian formulation . in this approach ,",
    "one starts by defining certain field quantities as a functions of spatial coordinates and time .",
    "the evolution of these field quantities is described by partial derivatives , and the tilt phenomenon does not exist at all .",
    "this is an example of different physical viewpoints and different mathematical formulations that are all equivalent to one another .",
    "it must be clearly understood that in the right part of the wave equation in macroscopic electrodynamics , sources must be field variables , exactly like the electromagnetic fields are . in the lagrangian formulation ,",
    "upstream of the kicker there is no particle motion along the plane of simultaneity and there is no need for translation to the eulerian formulation either .",
    "downstream of the kicker , only the eulerian formulation can be used in the electrodynamical part of the problem , and in particular for calculating coherent undulator radiation emission .",
    "we showed that the microbunch front tilt in an xfel is related to a conventional choice .",
    "also the concept of simultaneity between two events in different places includes a certain degree of conventionality , and the case of the microbunch front tilt in an ultrarelativistic electron beam seems a particular case of this .",
    "the microbunch front tilt is conventional in the same sense in which the gauge freedom that arises in field theory makes the choice between coulomb and lorentz gauges conventional : a study of mucrobunching phenomena can never lead to a determination of the influence of the microbunch front tilt .",
    "this viewpoint is in contradiction with results in literature that miss a non - trivial but important kinematical aspect in the description of coherent undulator radiation of a modulated electron beam with an amplitude front tilt .",
    "in fact , according to conventional treatments , coherent radiation is emitted along the normal to the microbunching wavefront .",
    "we explained this point phenomenologically on the basis of the effect of aberration of light in the framework of the theory of special relativity .",
    "however , such an approach can lead the reader to believe that a description of aberration effects in undulator radiation is impossible without the use of the special theory of relativity .",
    "in contrast to this , we showed that the effect of aberration of light can be simply explained in the laboratory frame of reference , and there is no need to use the laws of relativistic kinematics .",
    "the problem of electromagnetic wave amplification in an undulator refers to a class of self - consistent problems .",
    "it can be separated into two parts .",
    "first , the solution of the dynamical problem , i.e. finding the motion of particles under the action of a given electromagnetic fields .",
    "second , the solution of the electrodynamic problem , i.e. finding the electromagnetic fields generated by a given distribution of charges and currents . to close the problem ,",
    "the field equations and the equations of motion should be solved simultaneously . in this",
    "away , computers allow one to perform simulations of the xfel process .",
    "however , these simulations are not a ` first principle ' or ` full physics ' description of the xfel process .",
    "they are undoubtedly very important scientific tools , but they follow specific models .",
    "the correctness of their outcome is related to the correctness of these models , meaning that the validity of simulations should always be cross - checked with analytical results . by considering the case in which a microbunch front tilt is present , it can be seen that there are difficulties with the conventional coupling of fields and particles in xfel codes .",
    "the performance of an xfel can be reduced if any of a number of undulator parameters deviates from its optimal value .",
    "analysis of the effect of trajectory errors on the xfel amplification process showed that they become more and more important at shorter wavelengths .",
    "previous numerical studies of this critical aspect in the design of a xfel sources are , however , based on a kinematically incorrect model . therefore , the tolerances predicted are more stringent than they need be .",
    "this can be considered one of the reason for the exceptional progress in angstrom xfel developments over the last decade .",
