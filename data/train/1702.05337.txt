    "spin structure of the nucleon has been investigated extensively especially after the emc discovery on the small quark - spin contribution to the nucleon spin .",
    "now , its studies are focused on gluon - spin and orbital - angular - momentum effects . on the other hand , a spin-1 hadron has richer spin structure than the spin-1/2 nucleon in the sense that there are four additional structure functions in charged - lepton inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) @xcite .",
    "they are named as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 @xcite , which are associated with the tensor structure of the spin-1 hadron .",
    "the leading - twist structure functions are @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and they are related to each other by the callan - gross - like relation @xmath6 in the bjorken scaling limit .",
    "these additional structure functions are interesting quantities for probing different dynamical aspects on hadron structure , possibly of exotic nature as we suggest in this article , than the ones for the spin-1/2 nucleon .    within the parton model ,",
    "the structure function @xmath0 satisfies the sum @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 is the bjorken scaling variable , by considering only the valence - quark part for the tensor structure .",
    "however , it does not mean @xmath9 for actual hadrons . in the fixed - target dis , the simplest stable spin-1 target is the deuteron .",
    "if the deuteron @xmath0 is calculated in the convolution model @xcite , it is , in fact , finite and shows an oscillatory behavior as a function of @xmath8 . furthermore , shadowing mechanisms contribute significantly to @xmath0 at small @xmath8 @xcite , and pions in the deuteron could also play a role @xcite .",
    "there are related studies on spin-1 hadron structure on polarized proton - deuteron drell - yan process @xcite , leptoproduction of spin - one hadron @xcite , fragmentation functions @xcite , generalized parton distributions @xcite , target - mass corrections @xcite , positivity constraints @xcite , lattice qcd estimates @xcite , and angular momenta for spin-1 hadron @xcite .",
    "the spin-1 deuteron structure can be also investigated by tagging the final state proton @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is a unique opportunity to investigate the gluon transversity distribution which exists only for hadrons with spin@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the first measurement of @xmath0 was reported by the hermes collaboration in 2005 @xcite , and possible tensor - polarized parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) were extracted from the data @xcite .",
    "the hermes data are much larger in magnitude compared to the conventional convolution calculation of refs .",
    "it indicates that a new hadron mechanism should be possibly considered to interpret the large magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "as such an exotic mechanism , a contribution from a hidden - color state is proposed as a possibility together with a pionic contribution in ref .",

    "the deuteron tensor structure has been investigated for a long time at low energies in terms of hadron degrees of freedom , and it originates from the d - state admixture in a bound proton - neutron system .",
    "however , time has come to investigate the tensor structure in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom through the structure functions @xmath11 . in particular , the hermes data seem to suggest a possible existence of an exotic hadron mechanism for interpreting their data because they deviate significantly from a conventional theoretical prediction . for describing nuclear structure functions at medium and large @xmath8 ,",
    "it is standard to use a convolution formalism , where a nuclear structure function is given by the corresponding one convoluted with a nucleon momentum distribution in a nucleus @xcite .",
    "it is considered as a baseline calculation in describing nuclear modifications of @xmath12 at medium and large @xmath8 in terms of the nuclear binding , fermi motion , and short - range correlations embedded in the spectral function of the nucleon .",
    "we can use the same model for the deuteron in describing the structure functions including @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we can also use another convolution description of the virtual nucleon approximation @xcite which is used for describing the tagged structure functions of the spin-1 deuteron @xcite .",
    "there is only one type of theoretical calculation in the convolution picture .",
    "a basic formalism was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , and updated result is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite . since the deviation from this model is very important for indicating a new hadron - physics mechanism , we need to check its results independently .",

    "in fact , we obtain very different numerical results from the previous theoretical estimate of ref .",

    "this work is important for considering the upcoming thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) experiments @xcite .",
    "there are also experimental possibilities to investigate the tensor - polarized pdfs and structure functions at fermilab @xcite and the future electron - ion collider @xcite .",
    "we use two types of convolution formalisms for calculating @xmath0 of the deuteron .",

    "<S> tensor - polarized structure functions of a spin-1 hadron are additional observables which do not exist for the spin-1/2 nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> they could probe novel aspects of internal hadron structure . </S>",
    "<S> twist-2 tensor - polarized structure functions are @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and they are related by @xmath2 in the bjorken scaling limit . in this work , we theoretically calculate @xmath0 in the standard convolution description for the deuteron . </S>",
    "<S> two different theoretical models , a basic convolution description and a virtual nucleon approximation , are used for calculating @xmath0 and their results are compared with the hermes measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we found large differences between our theoretical results and the data . </S>",
    "<S> although there is still room to improve by considering higher - twist effects and in experimental extraction of @xmath0 from the spin asymmetry @xmath3 , there is a possibility that the large differences require physics beyond the standard deuteron model for their interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> future @xmath0 studies could shed light on a new field of hadron physics . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , detailed experimental studies of @xmath0 will start soon at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there are possibilities to investigate tensor - polarized parton distribution functions and @xmath0 at fermi national accelerator laboratory and future electron - ion collider . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , further theoretical studies are needed for understanding the tensor structure of the spin-1 deuteron , including a new mechanism to explain the large differences between the current data and our theoretical results . </S>"
