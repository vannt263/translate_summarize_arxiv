    "let @xmath33 be the largest value of @xmath37 such that @xmath88 .",
    "if by setting @xmath89 , we obtain a valid configuration with volume @xmath90 , we say that @xmath87 has a removable @xmath91-part located at @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath87 has a removable 1-part , then setting @xmath89 corresponds to removing the @xmath91-part .",
    "for example , for @xmath51 ,      has a removable @xmath91-part at @xmath92 while   has no removable @xmath91-part . for @xmath93 , adding a @xmath91-part to every configuration with volume @xmath90 generates all configurations with volume @xmath8 with a removable @xmath91-part .",
    "thus , one has @xmath94 * remarks : * given a configuration of volume @xmath90 , it is always possible to add a removable one - part to create a unique configuration of volume @xmath8 that has a removable one - part . for every @xmath93",
    ", there exists at least one configuration without a removable one - part .",

    "since these @xmath103 configurations do not exhaust all possible configurations , one has @xmath108 since @xmath109 for @xmath110 from proposition [ monotone ] , we obtain @xmath111 we thus get the following lower bound @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",

    "@xmath123 where in the second line , we have replaced the counting of skew plane partitions to plane partitions by filling in @xmath119 with the largest possible value which can be estimated to be @xmath124 . since @xmath125 , we assume that it is @xmath126 .",
    "since @xmath116 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath8 , it follows that among all partitions of @xmath8 into four parts , the largest term in the above product occurs when all @xmath127 are equal .",
    "thus one has @xmath128 for @xmath129 . using this ,",
    "we obtain @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the number of partitions of @xmath36 into four parts .",
    "taking logarithms and discarding terms that grow as @xmath132 that arise from @xmath133 , we obtain @xmath134 on using @xmath135 see @xcite .",
    "a heuristic proof of @xmath3-independence is as follows .",

    "this suggests that the @xmath3-dependence is suppressed by at least a power of @xmath141 .",

    "we assume that @xmath158 takes the following asymptotic form : @xmath159 using this form , one can show that @xmath160 for our monte carlo fits , we use a variant of the above formula @xmath161 where we have added some sub - leading terms ( suppressed by @xmath162 ) without changing the number of parameters .",
    "this formula is suited to our monte carlo simulation as it relates the quantities computed in the simulation to the parameters that appear in the asymptotic form for @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath163 has to be determined separately as it drops out of the above formula .",
    "the monte carlo simulation is a randomisation of the bratley - mckay algortihm .",
    "we adapted the transition matrix monte carlo method described in @xcite to study solid partitions restricted to be in a box and to estimate the asymptotics of solid partitions in @xcite .",
