    "while linear , calorimetric , fits ( @xmath66 , blue lines ) are not in strong conflict with our data ( specifically for the magphys relations ) , non - calorimetric models for radio emission will require further investigation in the meerkat / askap / ska era .",
    "using the 1.4ghz luminosity - sfr calibration derived above , it is possible to explore the 1.4ghz sfr - m@xmath0 relation ( figure [ fig : ke12 ] ) .",
    "we display the flux - measured stacked data points as solid black triangles , luminosity - measured stacked data points as open squares and the individually detected gama - first sample are shown as circles colour coded by their redshift .",
    "we show the sfr - m@xmath0 relation fit for the gama - spirals sample using the radiative transfer sfrs from d16 as the black solid line , and the same fit at various redshifts ( colour coded in the same manner as the data points ) using the evolution of the normalisation of the sfr - m@xmath0 relation using eq 20 of d16 .",
    "green dashed and dotted lines show the h@xmath2-derived sfr - m@xmath0 fits from sdss at z=0 @xcite and gama i + sdss at @xmath67 @xcite respectively .",
    "these do not include the turnover at high stellar masses as they are fit linearly .",
    "we find that the slope and normalisation of the 1.4ghz sfr - m@xmath0 relation from our stacked samples , using our new calibration ( black triangles ) , has the same slope to that derived in d16 at log[m@xmath0/m@xmath35]<10.5 ( figure [ fig : ke12 ] ) ; the black line in this figure is the fit using the same sample that is stacked in this work , but with slight normalisation offset ( @xmath130.05dex for the flux - weighted stacks using uv+tir ) . while the magphys stacked data points are @xmath130.3dex lower than the d16 relation , this is roughly consistent with the offset in normalisation between the uv+tir and magphys sfr - m@xmath0 relations in figure 8 of d16 .",
    "the slope of the 1.4ghz sfr - m@xmath0 relation flattens at log[m@xmath0/m@xmath35]>10.5 .",
    "this is expected given the well known turn over in the sfr - m@xmath0 relation at high stellar masses ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and discussion in d16 ) .",
    "the turnover observed here is severe however , given that our stacked sample is based on purely spiral galaxies .",
    "we do highlight that there is a turn over observed in other sfr indicators using the same sample ( see coloured circles in figure 8 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this is less extreme ( although only measured to log[m@xmath0/m@xmath35]=10.5 ) .",
    "potentially we are simply observing the increasing contribution of passive bulges , in terms of specific sfr , in galaxies at the high mass end .",
    "further studies into the high mass turn over in comparison to galaxy morphology and components will be the subject of upcoming work ( davies et al , in prep ) .",
    "primarily the gama - first individually detected galaxies lie well above the sfr - m@xmath0 relation at their redshift , suggesting they are star - bursting galaxies .",
    "this is unsurprising given that they are detected in the relatively shallow first data .",
    "the exceptions to this are the very local galaxies ( red points ) , which are mostly consistent with the sfr - m@xmath0 relation ; very nearby sources can be detected by first to lower sfrs .",
    "it is also interesting to note that using the individually detected gama - first galaxies , one would not have been able to define the 1.4ghz sfr - m@xmath0 relation given the small number of sources spread over a large redshift range .",
    "this highlights the power in performing optically - motivated source stacking of radio continuum data using surveys such as gama .",
    "the stacked data points allow us explore the 1.4ghz sfr - m@xmath0 relation to lower stellar masses than those probed by the individual detected sources and for the first time , show that the slope and normalisation of the 1.4ghz sfr - m@xmath0 relation over 2 decades in stellar mass is consistent with previous estimates using other multiple sfr tracers .",
    "despite the recent advancements in studying 1.4ghz emission from galaxies in large area surveys , the relatively shallow depth of current radio continuum surveys such as first and nvss , and the small area of deep radio continuum surveys , such as vla - cosmos @xcite and atlas 1.4ghz @xcite , have limited the number of sources with detectable 1.4ghz continuum emission with which to derive sfrs .",
    "this is set to change dramatically with the advent of new deep large area continuum surveys from the square kilometre array ( ska ) and its precursors such as askap - emu @xcite and meerkat - mightee @xcite .",
    "one of the key scientific goals of the ska is to measure the cosmic star - formation history using the radio continuum as a dust - unbiased tracer of star - formation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a potential limiting factor in the use of the 1.4ghz sfr tracer in large area surveys however , is the lack of robust spectroscopic redshifts , with which to derive 1.4ghz luminosities from observed flux densities and aid in the separation of agn / sf - like sources .",
    "emu is likely to detect 70 million galaxies , of which only a small faction will have spectroscopic redshifts , mostly at low-@xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) from emus sibling hi spectral line survey wallaby ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the local galaxy redshift survey , taipan . beyond the very local universe , emu will have to either rely on photometric redshifts , undertake additional spectroscopic observations , or use redshifts from existing large area surveys .",
    "the gama survey and upcoming wide area vista survey ( waves , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are ideally suited to providing a large number of spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "gama contains redshifts for @xmath13280,000 galaxies in the emu footprint at @xmath70 .",
    "in addition , gama provides an extensive database of multi - wavelength observations and value added catalogues of fir luminosities , stellar masses , dust masses , metallicities , environmental metrics and most importantly , multiple metrics of star formation with which to compare to the observed emu luminosities ( see d16 ) .",
    "the upcoming waves survey will add @xmath71 m galaxies to this sample to @xmath72 , which will be invaluable in providing redshifts , environmental metrics , and derived parameters for emu sources .",
    "the combination of gama / waves with the askap surveys ( emu , wallaby and deep investigations of neutral gas origins , dingo , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will produce a formidable dataset with which to study galaxy evolution over an extensive redshift baseline .    using the 1.4ghz luminosity to sfr relations derived in the previous section",
    "we make predictions for the number of gama star - forming galaxies that are likely to be detected in upcoming deep radio continuum surveys using askap .",
    "we take the full gama ii@xmath16 sfrs derived in d16 for a number of different sfr methods , and use the 1.4ghz luminosity to sfr relation to predict the rest - frame 1.4ghz luminosity for all gama ii@xmath16 sources . assuming @xmath47 and the gama redshift",
    ", we then convert each luminosity to a predicted observed flux density .",
    "we then exclude all sources which are detected as an agn using the bpt diagnostic or have @xmath29 colours consistent with an agn ( @xmath73 - as in the top two panels of figure [ fig : bpt ] ) .",
    "we also exclude all sources which do not have a @xmath27 detection in the observable used to determine the source s sfr ; such sources may have erroneous measurements of star formation . for magphys",
    "we only consider sources where the derived sfr is greater then twice the error .",
    "figure [ fig : predict ] displays the predicted distribution of 1.4ghz flux densities from all gama ii@xmath16 sources using four of the different sfr methods discussed in d16 , for both uv+tir ( top ) and magphys ( bottom ) calibrations .",
    "h@xmath2 , @xmath74-band and uv+tir sfrs are all derived using the recalibration process detailed in d16 .",
    "the various histograms in each figure highlight different predictions for the 1.4ghz flux density distribution from gama sources , assuming different sfr measures in gama ( @xmath28 how does the choice of sfr tracer in gama affect the prediction ) , while the two sets of panels show the variation based on the 1.4ghz to sfr calibration used ( either eq . [",
    "eq : uvtir ] , using uv+tir , or eq .",
    "[ eq : magp ] , using magphys ) .",
    "a potential caveat of this analysis is that the 1.4ghz calibration derived in this work is for late - type star - forming galaxies , but this calibration is applied to all gama galaxies ( and may not be appropriate in all cases ) .",
    "we compare this predicted distribution to the observed number density of sources in deep radio continuum surveys , using a combination of the vla - cosmos @xcite and vla - ecdfs @xcite surveys .",
    "first , we use the vla - cosmos 1.4ghz catalogue of @xcite . in order to produce a representative sample of gama - like galaxies ,",
    "we perform a 3@xmath19 position match ( to be consistent with our previous matching ) of the vla - cosmos catalogue to the cosmos photometric catalogue of @xcite and retain matches which have @xmath75 , the gama selection limit .",
    "we then combine this with the vla - ecdfs optical counterpart catalogue of @xcite , once again cut at @xmath75 . the gold line in figure",
    "[ fig : predict ] displays the number density as a function of flux density for @xmath75 sources in the combined vla - cosmos+ecdfs .",
    "we also include a 16% cosmic variance error ( gold band ) , calculated using the prescription in @xcite to account for the small volume coverage of these deep surveys at low-@xmath68 .",
    "however , this process does not account for these deep surveys resolving out flux for low redshift sources .",
    "in addition , we display the predicted number density of sources from the ska simulated skies ( s@xmath76 ) simulations of extragalactic radio continuum sources ( s@xmath76-sex ) outlined in @xcite . to make this comparable to a potential gama - first sample , we take all sources from s@xmath76-sex at @xmath70 and match them to the the observed distribution of gama sources in k - band magnitude ( in the absence of stellar mass in the s@xmath76-sex catalogues ) .",
    "we take the observed k - band distribution from gama and randomly sample from the s@xmath76-sex simulated sources at @xmath70 to produce the same k - mag number density distribution . while this is not ideal , and should be treated as a very loose prediction for a gama - like sample , it aims to produce as close to a gama - representative sample from s@xmath76-sex as possible .",
    "we show the number density of these s@xmath76-sex sources as the green line in figure [ fig : predict ]    strikingly the predicted number density using the h@xmath2 sfrs in gama is very close to the observed distribution from vla - cosmos+ecdfs and the predicted distribution from s@xmath76-sex .",
    "this suggests that our predictions are producing a comparable number density of 1.4ghz sources to the observed distribution at @xmath77mjy .",
    "the h@xmath2 sfr appears most well correlated with the observed distribution , potentially as both mechanisms probe the central regions of galaxies , particularly when using the high resolution first imaging .",
    "it is also important to remember that this h@xmath2 sfr has been previously re - calibrated using the radiative transfer - derived sfr in d16 .    using these distributions",
    "it is therefore possible to make predictions for the number of gama sources which are likely to be detectable in emu and dingo - continuum .",
    "the green and red dashed lines in figure [ fig : predict ] show the 5@xmath78rms limits of emu and dingo - continuum , taken as 0.05mjy and 0.025mjy respectively . taking the number density of gama sources above the emu limit and scaling to the full gama volume ( @xmath79deg@xmath9 )",
    "we obtain the predicted number of gama - emu sources , for each sfr method , given in the top right corner of the figure .",
    "we then also predict the number of sources which will be undetected in emu but detectable in the dingo - continuum overlap with the gama - g23 field ( @xmath80deg@xmath9 ) .",
    "the predictions range from @xmath1365,000 to @xmath13115,000 gama - askap sources depending on sfr tracer used .",
    "this suggests that @xmath81 of gama star forming galaxies ( plus many radio - loud agn ) are likely to be detected in gama - emu .",
    "the large uncertainty in these predictions shows the differences / confusion in deriving sfrs using multiple tracers with different assumptions and sources of error , and once again highlights the need for a robust dust unbiased tracer of star - formation .",
    "a comparison between the true distribution of star - forming galaxies in gama - askap and these predictions , will help constrain the robustness of individual sfr tracers .         clearly , using current surveys to investigate the dust - unbiased evolution of star - formation in the local universe is limited by the depth of large area radio surveys - the gama - first sample is heavily constrained by the number of first detections .",
    "however , with the advent of the askap surveys we will no longer be constrained by the lack of radio detections , but in fact by the number of robust redshifts available to match to secure radio sources .",
    "this highlights the necessity for further deep , wide area spectroscopic surveys such as waves . applying the same prescription as above to the current waves mock catalogues",
    ", we can predict that @xmath82 of the @xmath71million waves sources are likely to be detected by emu - producing an impressive dataset with which to study galaxy evolution from the nuv through to the radio continuum .",
    "we have defined a robust sample of individually detected gama - first galaxies and produced a stellar mass weighted stack in the first images at the position of a volume limited spirals sample in gama .",
    "we exclude agn from our sample using the bpt diagram , radio power , @xmath29 colours , 1.4ghz - w4 relation and @xmath40-band size to produce an uncontaminated star - forming galaxy sample .",
    "we then compare the 1.4ghz luminosity of our sample to previously derived sfrs from gama and derive new 1.4ghz luminosity to sfr calibrations .",
    "we derive the dust - unbiased sfr - m@xmath0 relation to show that our new calibrations produce a relation with a same slope and normalisation roughly consistent to that previously derived for gama using 12 other sfr methods @xcite , highlighting the power of optically motivated source stacking in large area radio surveys .",
    "this also shows that our calibrations are robust in deriving sfrs from radio luminosity . we do find a significant turn over at the high mass end , potentially highlighting a true turnover in the distribution , which is not observed in d16 ( although they do not probe as high in stellar mass ) .",
    "we use this relation to make predictions for the number of gama sources that are likely to be detected in radio continuum by upcoming askap surveys . using the gama h@xmath2 sfrs",
    "we obtain a prediction which is consistent with existing deep radio surveys at flux density @xmath83mjy .",
    "we predict that between 65,000 and 115,000 gama sources ( @xmath1325 - 45% ) are likely to be detected by askap , and in the near future a further @xmath82 emu sources will have spectroscopic redshifts from waves .",
    "the combination of deep , large area radio surveys and spectroscopic redshift surveys will revolutionise our view of dust - unbiased star - formation in the universe .",
