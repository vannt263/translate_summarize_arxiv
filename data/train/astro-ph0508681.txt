    "@xcite considered rates of sne found in the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) .",
    "these authors found 17 sne  ia to @xmath9 = 1.0 and 16 core - collapse sne ( types ii and ibc ) to @xmath9 = 0.9 . given that goods found sne  ia to @xmath9 = 1.6 , we may consider goods close to being volume limited at the lower redshifts just stated .",
    "this is what is being found with nearby sne discovered by the katzman automatic imaging telescope @xcite @xmath36 comparable numbers of sne  ia and core - collapse sne are found in a volume limited sample .",

    "essence should be finding between 10 and 20 times as many sne  ia compared to core - collapse sne on the basis of the relative volumes being sampled .",
    "since our experiment has as its goal the discovery of 200 sne  ia , we even try to select against type ii sne by imposing a color cut on the candidates flagged as potential objects of interest .",
    "since type ii sne are very blue prior to maximum light , we ignore candidates with @xmath71 .",
    "this increases the chance that a spectrum of a candidate will reveal a sn  ia .",

    "the total integration times were 3700  s ( e510 ) , 5100  s ( sn  2003jo ) , and 4400  s ( the other seven sne ) .",
    "as one can see , only sn  2003jo , sn  2003ll , and sn  2003li were hosted by galaxies sufficiently large and bright to show significant structure .",
    "it is not entirely clear that the galaxy near sn  2003kv is the host of that sn .",
    "several of our objects were effectively `` hostless '' sne , meaning that the hosts , if they exist , have surface brightness too low to be detected in @xmath0 and ground - based images .",
    "the program snid indicates that sn  2003ku is a sn  ia , but there is ambiguity regarding its true redshift .",
    "while the most likely redshift on the basis of the spectrum is 0.79 , the next most likely redshift is 0.41 ; see   3.3 and @xcite for more comments .",
    "we observed supernova e510 spectroscopically on 29 november 2003 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) .",
    "we obtained one 1800  s spectrum with gemini north + gmos , but were then shut down by high humidity , and we were unable to obtain a redshift from the nearly featureless spectrum .",
    "we also attempted to get spectra with keck , but were hampered by high humidity and clouds . in mid - october 2004 , long after the sn had faded , we attempted to get a redshift from spectra of the faint host galaxy .",
    "we took three 1800  s spectra with gemini north + gmos , but there was insufficient signal to extract a usable spectrum which would provide a redshift .",
    "however , following the guidelines of @xcite and @xcite , one can derive a redshift - independent distance to a _ set _ of sne  ia , provided one has sufficiently good photometric coverage in more than a single passband .",
    "for any individual object the results are understandably somewhat uncertain .",

    "it is best if we eliminate it from further consideration .",
    "because there is no spectral information for e510 , it never received an iau designation .",
    "@xcite indicate that sn  2003kv was probably a sn  ia , but the spectroscopic identification was not certain .",
    "photometric analysis ( below ) is entirely consistent with the notion that sn  2003kv was a sn  ia .    the essence supernovae were not observed as `` targets of opportunity '' ( toos ) with @xmath0 since these are very disruptive to the scheduling of the telescope .",
    "instead , a `` pseudo - too '' method was employed which was pioneered by the high - redshift supernova search teams several years ago .",
    "we specify months before observation ( in the phase ii submission ) the region on the sky to be searched , and we specify dates that exact supernova positions will be available for insertion into the @xmath0 schedule .",
    "usually it is five days to a week before @xmath0 begins observing the supernovae after the coordinates have been delivered .",
    "generally we have a number of supernovae in each field from which to choose for @xmath0 observations , but there are times when a non - optimal target must be inserted at the deadline .",
    "also , because of the delays between the supernova discovery , spectral confirmation , and the @xmath0 schedule upload , the supernovae are rarely observed before maximum light with @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath0 was meant to improve the quality of photometry at late times for our faintest targets , this delay is not a major problem for this study .",
    "our @xmath0/acs data were obtained using the f625w , f775w , and f850lp filters , which are essentially the same as the @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 filters of the sdss photometric system @xcite .",
    "the throughput transmission curves with @xmath0/acs are shown in the appendix .",
    "one of our objects was observed in the near - infrared with nicmos and its f110w filter ( similar to a @xmath76-band filter ) .",

    "we also add to the histogram seven values for essence sne listed in table [ lc_fits ] .",
    "figure [ dm15_hist ] shows that spiral galaxies are more likely to produce slowly declining sne  ia , while ellipticals are more likely to produce rapidly declining ones ; for further details see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss why this might be the case , but for now it must just stand as an empirical fact .",
    "the striking aspect of the histogram is that all but one of the essence sne are at the extreme slow - declining end of the distribution .",
    "figure [ stamps ] suggests that sn  2003jo , sn  2003ll , and sn  2003li occurred in spiral galaxies on the basis of their morphology in the @xmath0 images .",
    "sn  2003kv is projected near a bright galaxy , but spectroscopy is needed to show that it is the host .",
    "the other five sne discussed here occurred in very faint hosts , about which we have almost no information for the purposes of morphological or spectroscopic classification .",
    "none of the 9 sne was found in a galaxy that is obviously an elliptical .",
    "using the local sample as a guide , we would expect a small number ( 3 ) of our essence sample to be in e / s0 galaxies .",
    "but such an extrapolation to a magnitude limited sample is dangerous .",
    "sne  ia in nearby early - type galaxies are , on average , fast decliners and intrinsically faint at maximum , so less likely to be found in our search .",
    "therefore , a lack of early - type hosts is not surprising . a more detailed analysis of this bias is discussed below .    for a discussion of the properties of nearby galaxies that have hosted sne ia ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the host galaxies of high-@xmath9 sne  ia has been discussed by a number of authors .",
    "@xcite studied 22 galaxies at @xmath109 and found that @xmath270% of high-@xmath9 sne occur in spirals and @xmath230% occur in ellipticals , similar to the percentages for the local sample .",
    "they found no evidence that sne  ia are preferentially found in the outer regions of the hosts , implying that host galaxy extinctions of the high-@xmath9 sample should be comparable to the local examples .",
    "@xcite found no correlations of the distance residuals with host - galaxy properties in the redshift range @xmath110 .",
    "their 18 galaxies which hosted sne were discovered by the high-@xmath9 supernova search team @xcite .",
    "@xcite found from a larger sample ( * ? ? ?",
    "* objects discovered by the supernova cosmology project ) that there is evidence for a larger _ scatter _ of the absolute magnitudes for the high-@xmath9 sne occurring in spirals .",
    "they also found that sne occurring in spirals are on average marginally less luminous than those in e / s0 galaxies , by @xmath111 mag .",
    "but this is opposite of what is seen at low redshifts @xcite .",
    "these analyses do not lead us to believe that there are significant differences between the hosts of low-@xmath9 and our high-@xmath9 sne  ia or between the sne  ia themselves .",
    "why , then , do all but one of the essence objects discussed in this paper have such slow decline rates ? some of the issues involved have already been discussed by @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the sne  ia in this paper not typical of essence sne in general .",
    "they were chosen to be at the highest redshift end of the essence distribution for @xmath0 follow - up .    in figure",
    "[ control_time ] we provide an illustrative answer .",
    "let us assume that we discover all the sne in the @xmath58 band , and ignore the @xmath68 band .",
    "assume a fixed magnitude limit for detection ; we shall use @xmath58 = 23.0 mag , which gives s / n @xmath112 for images obtained in good seeing ( @xmath113 ) . varying the limit will change the details but not the general result .",
    "we calculate the time a sn  ia stays above the detection limit as a function of  and redshift . this is the `` control time , '' but we will only include the time before maximum , since detection before the time of maximum was a requirement for @xmath0 follow - up observations .",
    "figure [ control_time ] shows that the control time is a steeply falling function of . for @xmath114",
    "this is not a problem for the essence search since we visit the same piece of sky every four nights .",
    "but beyond @xmath109 the fast - declining events are not above our detection threshold long enough to have been included in the @xmath0 sample .",
    "as we push to high redshift it is clear that our @xmath0 selection is highly biased to the slowest - declining sne  ia .",
    "the selection effect which increased our sample of slowly declining light curves relative to the average distribution will affect their cosmological use .",
    "our sne  ia may be slower than average for their luminosity or intrinsically brighter than expected for their observed light curve shape as a result of the selection effect .",
    "while this selection bias is strong in our @xmath0 sample , it will be present in the highest - redshift slice of any magnitude - limited search for sne  ia .",
    "fast - declining events are not only fainter than slowly declining sne  ia , but are above any threshold for less time , leading to a control - time bias against their discovery . in designing a search that minimizes systematic errors , care must be taken to avoid this bias by either visiting fields at a rapid cadence or pruning the highest - redshift end of the accumulated sample .",
    "such a selection effect should be modeled once we have our full sample of 200 sne  ia to fully remove its impact .",
    "the spectral cross - correlation program snid indicated that the spectrum of sn  2003ku was most consistent with that of a sn  ia with @xmath115 , but redshift 0.41 was almost as likely @xcite .",
    "in figure [ e315_spec ] we show these two possibilities .",
    "sn 2003ku was the brightest of the nine sne discussed in this paper ( see figs .",

    "if @xmath9 = 0.79 , this object gives a derived distance modulus 2.5 mag `` too close '' compared to the empty - universe model .",
    "the batm analysis gave similar results ; if @xmath9 = 0.79 , the derived distance modulus is 1.7 mag smaller than one would get in an empty - universe model .",
    "while sne exhibit some dispersion in luminosities , and light - curve fitting of low s / n photometry adds to the scatter of measurable parameters , something is clearly amiss with an object that is discrepant by 2 mag . for sn",
    "2003ku several possibilities can be considered :    \\(1 ) the photometry contains some serious calibration error .",
    "one of the fields represented in figure [ ri_test ] was the sn  2003ku field .",
