    "the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions is extremely successful in explaining all the available experimental data @xcite , which is a striking confirmation of the @xmath2 invariant interactions involving fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "however , not only has the sm some unpleasant features , like the large number of free parameters , but it also leaves some questions answered , such as the reason for the proliferation of fermion generations and their complex pattern of masses and mixing angles .",
    "these problems must be addressed by models that are intended to be more fundamental than the sm .",
    "a large number of such extensions of the sm predict the existence of colour triplet particles carrying simultaneously leptonic and baryonic number , the so - called leptoquarks .",
    "leptoquarks are present in models that treat quarks and leptons on the same footing , and consequently quark - lepton transitions are allowed .",
    "this class of models includes composite models @xcite , grand unified theories @xcite , technicolour models @xcite , and superstring - inspired models @xcite .",
    "since leptoquarks are an undeniable signal for physics beyond the sm , there have been several direct searches for them in accelerators . at the cern large electron - positron collider ( lep ) , the experiments established a lower bound @xmath3@xmath4 gev for scalar leptoquarks @xcite . on the other hand , the search for scalar leptoquarks decaying into an electron - jet pair in @xmath5 colliders constrained their masses to be @xmath6 gev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the experiments at the desy @xmath7 collider hera @xcite place limits on their masses and couplings , leading to @xmath8 gev depending on the leptoquark type and couplings .",
    "there have also been many studies of the possibility of observing leptoquarks in the future @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite , and @xmath12 @xcite colliders .",
    "one can also constrain the masses and couplings of leptoquarks using the low - energy experiments @xcite . for energies much smaller than the leptoquarks mass",
    ", they induce two - lepton  two - quark effective interactions that can give rise to atomic parity violation , contributions to meson decay , flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , and to meson  anti - meson mixing .",
    "however , only leptoquarks that couple to first and second generation quarks and leptons are strongly constrained .    in the present work we study the constraints on scalar leptoquarks that can be obtained from their contributions to the radiative corrections to the @xmath0 physics .",
    "we evaluated the one - loop contribution due to leptoquarks to all lep observables and made a global fit in order to extract the 95% confidence level limits on the leptoquarks masses and couplings .",
    "the more stringent limits are for leptoquarks that couple to the top quarks .",
    "therefore , our results turn out to be complementary to the low energy limits bounds @xcite since these constrain more strongly first and second generation leptoquarks .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ l : eff ] we introduce the effective @xmath1 invariant effective lagrangians that we analysed and we also discuss the existing low energy constraints . section [ an : exp ] contains the relevant analytical expressions for the one - loop corrections induced by leptoquarks .",
    "our results and respective discussion are shown in sec.[res ] , and we summarize our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ conclusec ] .",
    "this paper is supplemented with an appendix that contains the relevant feynman rules .",
    "a natural hypothesis for theories beyond the sm is that they exhibit the gauge symmetry @xmath1 above the symmetry breaking scale @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , we imposed this symmetry on the leptoquark interactions . in order to avoid strong bounds",
    "coming from the proton lifetime experiments , we required baryon ( @xmath14 ) and lepton ( @xmath15 ) number conservation , which forbids the leptoquarks to couple to diquarks .",
    "the most general effective lagrangian for leptoquarks satisfying the above requirements and electric charge and colour conservation is given by @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) stands for the left - handed quark ( lepton ) doublet , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the singlet components of the fermions .",
    "we denote the charge conjugated fermion fields by @xmath23 and we omitted in ( [ lag : fer ] ) the flavour indices of the couplings to fermions and leptoquarks .",
    "the leptoquarks @xmath24 and @xmath25 are singlets under @xmath26 while @xmath27 and @xmath28 are doublets , and @xmath29 is a triplet .",
    "furthermore , we assumed in this work that the leptoquarks belonging to a given @xmath26 multiplet are degenerate in mass , with their mass denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "local invariance under @xmath1 implies that leptoquarks also couple to the electroweak gauge bosons . to obtain the couplings to @xmath31 , @xmath0 , and @xmath32",
    ", we substituted @xmath33 by the electroweak covariant derivative in the leptoquark kinetic lagrangian : @xmath34 with @xmath35 \\phi \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath36 stands for the leptoquarks interpolating fields , @xmath37 is the electric charge matrix of the leptoquarks , @xmath38 is the sine of the weak mixing angle , and the @xmath39 s are the generators of @xmath26 for the representation of the leptoquarks . the weak neutral charge @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 in the last reference of @xcite , for instance , there is a table with all the quantum numbers for all scalar leptoquarks . in the appendix we present the feynman rules for the interactions defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eff ] ) and ( [ lkin ] ) .",
    "low - energy experiments can lead to strong bounds on the couplings and masses of leptoquarks , due to induced four fermion interactions :    @xmath42 leptoquarks can give rise to fcnc processes if they couple to more than one family of quarks or leptons @xcite . in order to avoid strong bounds from fcncs , we assumed that the leptoquarks couple to a single generation of quarks and a single one of leptons .",
    "however , due to mixing effects on the quark sector , there is still some amount of fcnc @xcite and , therefore , leptoquarks that couple to the first two generations of quarks must comply with some low - energy bounds @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 the analyses of the decays of pseudoscalar mesons , like the pions , put stringent bounds on leptoquarks unless their coupling is chiral  that is , it is either left - handed or right - handed @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 leptoquarks that couple to the first family of quarks and leptons are strongly constrained by atomic parity violation @xcite . in this case , there is no choice of couplings that avoids the strong limits .",
    "it is interesting to keep in mind that the low - energy data constrain the masses of the first generation leptoquarks to be bigger than @xmath43@xmath44 tev when the coupling constants are equal to the electromagnetic coupling @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "in this work we employed the on - shell - renormalization scheme , adopting the conventions of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we used as inputs the fermion masses , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and the @xmath0 mass , and the electroweak mixing angle being a derived quantity that is defined through @xmath48 .",

    "for instance , starting from the unrenormalized self - energies ( [ sig : g][sig : w ] ) and the mass and wave - function counter - terms we obtain finite expression for the two - point functions of vector bosons .",
    "moreover , the contributions to the vertex functions @xmath85 and @xmath103 are finite , as can be seen from the explicit expressions ( [ w : ff2 ] ) and ( [ z : ll ] ) .    in order to check the consistency of our calculations , we analysed the effect of leptoquarks to the @xmath104 vertex at zero momentum , which is used as one of the renormalization conditions in the on - shell scheme .",

    "it turns out that the leptoquark contribution to the vertex function @xmath104 not only is finite but also vanishes at @xmath110 for all fermion species .",
    "therefore , our expressions for the different leptoquark contributions satisfy the appropriate qed ward identities @xcite , and leave the fermion electric charges unchanged .",
    "moreover , we also verified explicitly that the leptoquarks decouple in the limit of large @xmath30 .",
    "the above expressions for the radiative corrections to @xmath0 physics due to leptoquarks are valid for couplings and masses of any leptoquark . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we assumed that the leptoquarks couple to leptons and quarks of the same family . in the conclusions",
    ", we comment on how we can extend our results to other cases .    in order to gain some insight",
    "on which corrections are the most relevant , let us begin our analyses by studying just the oblique corrections @xcite , which can be parametrized in terms of the variables @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "the parameter @xmath111 vanishes since it is proportional to @xmath114 and we assumed the multiplets to be degenerate .",
    "the parameter @xmath113 also vanishes , while @xmath115 where the sum is over all members of a given multiplet .",
    "leptoquarks that are singlets under @xmath26 also lead to @xmath116 .",
    "notice that the above results depend only upon the interaction of leptoquarks with the gauge bosons . imposing that the leptoquark contribution to @xmath112 must be within the limits allowed by the lep data @xcite",
    ", we find out that the constraints coming from oblique corrections are less restrictive than the available experimental limits @xcite .",
    "therefore , the contribution of the leptoquarks to the oblique parameters are very small and do not lead to new bounds .",
    "we then performed a global fit to all lep data including both universal and non - universal contributions . in table",
    "[ lepdata ] we show the most recent combined results of the four lep experiments .",
    "these results are not statistically independent and the correlation matrix can be found in @xcite",
    ". we can express the theoretical predictions to these observables in terms of @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath70 , with the sm contributions being obtained from the program zfitter @xcite . in order to perform the global fit we constructed the @xmath119 function and minimized it using the package minuit . in our fit",
    "we used five parameters , three from the sm ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 ) and two new ones : @xmath30 and @xmath123 .",
    "we present our results as 95% cl lower limits in the leptoquark mass and study the dependence of these limits upon all the other parameters .",
    "the parameter of the sm that most strongly affects our results is the top mass ( @xmath120 ) , as expected .",
    "for this reason , figs.[fit1 ] exhibit the 95% cl limits obtained for a third generation leptoquark as a function of @xmath120 for several values of the coupling constants @xmath123 ( @xmath124 , 1 , and @xmath125 ) . in these figures",
    ", we fixed the value of @xmath126 gev and @xmath127 , which are the best values obtained from a fit in the framework of the sm @xcite .",
    "we can see from these figures that the limits on the leptoquarks @xmath24 , @xmath29 , and @xmath27 become stronger as @xmath120 increases .",
    "this result is analogous to the sm result for the radiative corrections to @xmath128 @xcite , where there is an enhancement by powers of the top quark mass , as can be seen , for instance , in eq .",
    "( [ chi : s1 ] ) .",
    "we can also learn from these figures that the limits are better for left - handed leptoquarks than for right - handed ones , given a leptoquark type .",
    "the contributions from @xmath129 and @xmath130 are not enhanced by powers of the top quark mass since these leptoquarks do not couple directly to up - type quarks .",
    "therefore , the limits are much weaker , depending on @xmath120 only through the sm contribution , and the bounds for these leptoquarks are worse than the present discovery limits unless they are strongly coupled ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "therefore , we do not plot the bounds for these cases . moreover , the limits on first and second generation leptoquarks are also uninteresting for the same reason . nevertheless , if we allow leptoquarks to mix the third generation of quarks with leptons of another generation the bounds obtained are basically the same as the ones discussed above - channel leptoquark exchange to some observables . ] , since the main contribution to the constraints comes from the @xmath0 widths .",
    "let us finally comment on the dependence of our bounds on other sm parameters besides @xmath120 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath120 , the dependence on @xmath122 and @xmath121 is rather weak , but it shows the pattern that the limits are more stringent as @xmath122 increases and @xmath121 decreases .",
    "for instance , the limits vary by about @xmath132 when @xmath122 is in the interval @xmath133 and by about @xmath134 for @xmath135 gev .",
    "we summarize our results in table [ res : top ] , where we assumed a top mass of @xmath136 gev are in qualitative agreement with those of ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "our analyses show that the lep data constrain more strongly the leptoquarks that couple to the top quark .",
    "since the most important ingredients in the bounds are the widths of the @xmath0 , we can conclude that our results should also give a good estimate for the cases where the leptoquarks couple to quarks and leptons from different families .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the constraints on leptoquarks coming from lep data are complementary to the low - energy ones , since these are more stringent for leptoquarks that couple to the first two families , while the former are stronger when the coupling is to the top quark .",
    "the bounds on scalars leptoquarks coming from low - energy and @xmath0 physics exclude large regions of the parameter space where the new collider experiments could search for these particles , however , not all of it @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we should keep in mind that nothing substitutes the direct observation .    * acknowledgements *    we want to thank d. bardine and a. olchevsky for providing us with the latest version of zfitter .",
