    "we recently studied effects of particle size and final - state interactions in the reaction @xmath0 within the framework of a constituent quark model @xcite .",
    "the aim was to improve previous attempts @xcite to describe the lear data on @xmath0 differential cross sections @xmath2 and analyzing powers @xmath3 in the momentum range from 360 to 1550 mev/@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "as of yet , theoretical approaches , whether using a baryonic or a quark picture  @xcite , have not been successful in reproducing the characteristic double - dip structure of the @xmath3 observables nor the @xmath2 forward peaks at low momenta .",
    "the large variations of the lear observables as a function of the angle portends the presence of a substantial number of partial wave amplitudes already at low energies .",
    "in fact , the experimental data on differential cross sections as well as those on asymmetries point to a significant @xmath5 , @xmath6 and even higher @xmath7 contributions  @xcite .",
    "model calculations @xcite , however , lead invariably to scattering amplitudes which are strongly dominated by total angular momentum @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this is due to a rather short range of the annihilation mechanism in these models .    in order to study possible higher partial wave @xmath1 contributions ,",
    "the role of final - state @xmath10 interactions has been investigated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite we made use of the non - planar @xmath11 quark - flow diagrams , in which a @xmath12 pair in either a @xmath13 or a @xmath14 state is annihilated and momentum is transferred to a remaining quark or antiquark as discussed in ref .",
    "switching on the @xmath10 interaction moderately improved the fit of @xmath3 , in particular the double - dip structure at low momenta is slightly more pronounced .",
    "this is caused by a readjustment of the strengths of the helicity amplitudes of different total angular momentum @xmath7 .",
    "nonetheless , the predictions for @xmath2 showed only a modest improvement over the model without final - state interactions .",
    "the main improvement obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , is due to a different aspect , namely a readjustment of the size parameters of the intrinsic proton and pion wave functions , so that the radii of the proton , antiproton , and pions increase . in a final fit",
    "these radii are larger by about 7% than the respective measured charge distribution radii .",
    "this runs contrary to the view that the valence quarks occupy a smaller volume than indicated by the charge radii .",
    "nevertheless , introducing larger radii as well as final - state interactions , improves the quality of the fit in ref .",
    "@xcite dramatically  the forward and backward peaks of @xmath2 are very well reproduced and so are the characteristic double - dip structures of @xmath3 .",
    "it should come as no surprise that the relative contribution of the higher @xmath1 amplitudes in ref .",
    "@xcite turns out to be significantly larger than in ref .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we report an alternative approach that also leads to enhancement of the higher partial waves .",
    "it addresses the relativistic effects due to lorentz transformed intrinsic pion wave functions in the reaction @xmath0 .",
    "the reason for this rather different approach stems from the observation that at the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energies @xmath15 considered in the lear experiment @xmath0 , the produced pions are highly energetic .",
    "the relativistic factor in this energy range is @xmath16 , which means the pions are ejected at speeds @xmath17 .",
    "one therefore expects considerable relativistic effects due to their modified internal structure . in the c.m .",
    "frame in which the transition amplitudes are calculated , the intrinsic pion wave functions employed must be lorentz transformed from the pion rest frame . in our model",
    "@xcite the intrinsic pion as well as the proton and antiproton wave functions are of gaussian form in their respective rest frames .",
    "we neglect the distortions of the proton and antiproton intrinsic wave function due to their much smaller kinetic energy and larger mass .",
    "the relativistic effects have several consequences .",
    "first , the intrinsic geometry of the pions is modified  instead of spherical particles one deals now with highly flattened ellipsoids in the c.m .",
    "obviously , the reaction geometry is altered also since the boosted pion wave functions enter the computation of the transition operators , which are obtained from an overlap integral of initial antiproton - proton , final pion - pion wave functions and the @xmath13 or @xmath14 annihilation mechanism .",
    "details of this calculation were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . secondly , due to less overlap of the pion and antiproton - proton intrinsic wave functions , the annihilation range _ actually _ decreases but this effect is far from isotropic . as a result",
    "the transition operators exhibit significant additional angle dependence . finally , the annihilation amplitudes , already non - local in the case of non - relativistic wave functions , become explicitly dependent on the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath15 via the boost factor @xmath18 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the relativistic transformation of the spatial part of the intrinsic pion wave functions introduces new angle dependent terms in the transition operators .",
    "these new terms also depend on the boost factor @xmath18 . in this paper",
    ", we present a new fit to the lear data on @xmath0 using the @xmath11 transition operators of ref .",
    "@xcite , which supports our claim that relativistic considerations lead to a strongly modified angular momentum content of the helicity amplitudes for @xmath19 .",
    "especially the amplitudes for @xmath1 are amplified considerably .",
    "even though we keep the original particle radii as in @xcite , i.e. smaller than the corresponding charge distribution radii , we achieve a very good reproduction of the lear observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 , comparable to the one in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we summarize the effects of lorentz transforming intrinsic pion wave functions on @xmath0 annihilation operators within the constituent quark model .",
    "the actual details may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the pion rest frame ,",
    "the radial part of its intrinsic wave function is described by a gaussian of the form @xmath20 which reads in the c.m .",

    "as mentioned above , in previous work  @xcite we varied the value of @xmath25 in order to obtain an increase in the annihilation range . in this paper",
    "we use throughout the fixed value @xmath26@xmath27 , which corresponds to a pion radius of 0.48  fm @xcite . the new normalization factor",

    "this is a consequence of the strong angle dependence of @xmath84 . in order for the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude @xmath85 to converge ,",
    "all ingredients must be fine - tuned , in particular the phases @xmath63 and inelasticities @xmath64 for @xmath19 .",

    "is reproduced but some problems remain near @xmath87 .    as for the analyzing powers @xmath3 , we are able to reproduce their double - dip structure , already present in the lear data at the lowest energies . when the experimental errors are small , like for instance for @xmath88 and 499.2  mev , the fit is particularly successful .",

    "we present a new fit to the lear @xmath0 data based on relativistic effects in the annihilation .",
    "these effects are due to lorentz transformations of intrinsic pion wave functions from the pion rest frame to the c.m .",

    "frame of the reaction .",
    "we conclude that even though observed data at lear on @xmath2 and @xmath3 indicate strongly the presence of higher partial wave amplitudes and therefore seem to call for an increase of the annihilation range , one can obtain a similar improvement by additional angle dependence in the transition operators .",
    "this additional angle dependence arises naturally when boosted intrinsic pion wave functions are employed in the quark model calculations , as becomes clear from the present fit .",
    "relativistic effects in the reaction @xmath0 therefore should not be ignored .",
