    "many relevant properties of complex systems can be described by an appropriate network representation of their elements and interactions @xcite .",
    "most of these networks are directed , i. e. there is a directional relationship between two elements defining who influences who in a given order . among the class of directed networks ,",
    "directed acyclic graphs -henceforth , dags- are an important subset lacking feedback loops .",
    "this is specially suitable for the representation of evolutionary , developmental and historical _ processes _ in which the time asymmetry determines a feed - forward ( acyclic ) flow of causal relations . in this context , dags constitute a formal representation of causal relations that display the direct effects of earlier events over latter ones .",
    "citation networks are among their most paradigmatic cases @xcite . in these networks nodes",
    "are scientific articles and directed links ( or arcs ) stand for bibliographic citations among them . according to a chronological order ,",
    "directed links are established from former articles to newer ones in a feed - forward manner .    in general , time - dependent processes have been formalized as dags .",
    "examples of that comprehend article and patent citation networks @xcite , decision jurisprudence processes @xcite and tree genealogies and phylogenies . moreover , other relevant systems such as standard electric circuits @xcite , feed - forward neural @xcite and transmission networks @xcite are also suitably represented as dags .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to explore the _ randomness _ -in topological terms- of real systems displaying a directed acyclic structure by the defintion a collection of randomization methods that preserves a fixed number of topological invariants . to this end , the design of null models to highlight the particular features characterizing a system with respect to a neutral or _ random _",
    "scenario @xcite is needed . in this context , the so - called _ configuration model _",
    "@xcite has been probed as a fruitful approximation to provide a null - model scenario of what is expected by _ chance _ in complex networks under the assumptions of sparseness , infinite size and lack of correlations .",
    "however , little attention has been paid concerning dags .",
    "indeed , a rigorous definition of random dag from its directed degree sequence has been recently proposed @xcite , rising the interest for its study through configuration model approach .",
    "borrowing the methodology to build random undirected graphs @xcite , degree sequence is visualized as a set of edge _",
    "stubs_. hence a random dag is constructed by matching stubs according to certain order constraints until they are completely canceled @xcite . without neglecting the important advance it represents for the comprehension of acyclic networks ,",
    "some problems arise in using this methodology as the null model reference of real nets .",
    "firstly , this methodology is dependent on how probable is to construct a graph from a degree sequence , since not all of them produce a graph , i.e. , they are not _ graphical_. additionally , configuration model assumptions are not fulfilled in real systems due to their finite size and the presence of densely connected regions .",
    "an alternative approach used in this work is based on iterative processes of edge rewiring over the graph , keeping the _ graphical _ condition during all the process of randomization .",
    "this is a relevant issue since the degree sequence , either directed or undirected , imposes a particular space of topological configurations rather limited -as we shall see in this work- for dags .",
    "attending to this approach we can estimate where a real graph is placed preserving a graphical ensemble that holds some topological invariants .",
    "the two fundamental topological invariants considered in this work for a null model comparison are the degree sequence ( either directed or undirected ) and the component structure .",
    "the both types of degree sequences and the degree distribution have been typically chosen as invariant in the random model construction @xcite . however , as is well known in random graph theory , the existence of some graph satisfying a given degree sequence does not guarantee a single connected component containing the whole set of nodes , except at high connectivities .",
    "therefore sparse networks representing connected systems are expected to be fragmented during a randomization process .",
    "this may be an undesirable effect when studying historical processes since it breaks the flow of causality .",
    "besides this problem , there are also real systems that display more than a single connected component .",
    "those disconnected components do not interact among them and , arguably , can be considered to be independent systems in terms of causality .",
    "it is worth to note that preservation of connected component in graph randomization processes has recently raised the interest of network community @xcite .",
    "according to the above considerations , in order to produce comparable ensembles for the evaluation of the randomness of a real dag , we propose a collection of four randomization methods for dags that ensure the topological invariants mentioned above .",
    "these randomization techniques were applied to two extreme -in terms of degree - degree relations- network models : an erds rnyi dag and a highly ordered graph called _ snake_-dag . our methodology",
    "was then applied to three real dags : a citation network , a phd - student advisor network and the cell lineage in the development of _ caebnorhabditis elegans _ worm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii offers the basic concepts related to dags .",
    "section iii explicitly defines the set of four randomization algorithms according to different topological invariants .",
    "section iv describes and characterizes the randomness indicators and apply the randomization processes to the systems under study : two toy models -which enable us to validate the performance of the algorithms- and three real systems .",
    "section v discusses the relevance of the obtained results .",
    "in this section we discuss some mathematical properties of dags and their interpretation in terms of causal relations .",
    "we finally address the problem of component structure conservation .",
    "let @xmath0 be a directed graph , being @xmath1 the set of nodes , and the set of ordered pairs @xmath2 the set of edges -where the order , @xmath3 implies that there is an arrow in the following direction : @xmath4 . the _ underlying graph _",
    "@xmath5 of a directed graph @xmath6 is an undirected graph with the same set of nodes @xmath6 , but whose edges are undirected ( i.e. @xmath7 , then @xmath8 ) . given a node @xmath9 , the number of outgoing links , to be noted @xmath10 , is called the _ out - degree _ of @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , the number of ingoing links of @xmath11 is called _ in - degree _ of @xmath11 , noted by @xmath12 .",
    "a dag is a directed graph characterized by the absence of cycles : if there is a _ directed path _ from @xmath11 to @xmath13 ( i.e. , there is a finite sequence @xmath14 ) then , there is no directed path from @xmath13 to @xmath11 .",
    "borrowing concepts from order theory @xcite , we refer to nodes with @xmath15 as _ maximals _ and those with @xmath16 as _ minimals_. the absence of cycles ensures that at least there is one minimal node and one maximal node .",
    "maximal nodes can be seen as inputs of a given computational or sequential process while minimal -or terminal- ones are the outputs of such a process .",
    "furthermore the acyclic nature permits to define a node ordering by labeling all nodes with sequential natural numbers .",
    "thus , in a dag there is at least one numbering of the nodes such that : @xmath17 for this reason , dags have been also referred as _ ordered graphs _ @xcite .",
    "the theoretical roots of the concept of a random dag are based on the so - called directed degree sequence @xcite -as well as the concept of random graph @xcite .",

    "if we only pay attention to the number of edges connected to a given node @xmath11 -regardless the direction of the arrows- we define the _ degree _ of the node @xmath11 as @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , within this formalism , it is assumed that we can neglect the probability that two links begin at a given node @xmath13 and end in a given node @xmath11 , due to the assumption of _ sparseness_. as we shall see in section iv , such an assumption does not hold for some real systems . ] and , consistently , the _ undirected degree sequence _ of @xmath24 , is defined as : @xmath25 however , it is clear that not any sequence of @xmath22 pairs of natural numbers -or @xmath22 natural numbers in the case of the undirected degree sequence- represents the degree sequence of an ensemble of some kind of random graphs containing @xmath22 nodes @xcite .",
    "there are several restrictions that a ( un)-directed degree sequence must satisfy in order to represent a proper graph , i.e. , a sequence to be _ graphical _ or _ feasible _ @xcite . in the case of directed graphs , _ in",
    "_ and _ out _ degrees of the whole sequence must be consistent with the number of edges , i.e. : @xmath26 it is clear that such a condition does not avoid the presence of cycles in the network structure .",
    "consistently with the claim that dags depict systems where some unavoidable ordering among nodes is at work , we can ensure the generation of a given dag if and only if there is a labeling of the nodes such that @xmath27 implies that @xmath28 .",
    "taking into account this ordering to build the graph , the directed degree sequence must also hold two conditions .",
    "first , @xmath29 and second , @xmath30 under conditions ( [ cond1],[cond2],[cond3 ] ) it is ensured that a directed degree sequence will be graphical and able to represent the degree sequence of a given non - empty ensemble of dags .      the concept of component structure stems from the notion of undirected path : given two pairs of nodes @xmath31 , there is an _ undirected path _ among them if there is a finite sequence of undirected edges such that it can be ordered sequentially , for example @xmath32 .",
    "component _ of @xmath6 is a ( maximal ) subset of @xmath33 by which an undirected path can be defined among any pair of nodes .",
    "the special features of a dag impose constraints on the number of -dag like- components from a given directed degree sequence .",
    "indeed , let @xmath34 be the set of maximal nodes of a given dag @xmath6 and @xmath35 the set of its minimal nodes .",
    "let @xmath18 be the directed degree sequence of @xmath6 which , by assumption , is graphical . then , the number of ( dag ) components of the graph @xmath36 is bounded by @xmath37 since any connected dag must have , at least , @xmath38",
    ". another constraint must be satisfied .",

    "we obtain a random network conserving the undirected degree sequence of @xmath49 and its component structure by a randomization process denominated _ local - swap _ @xcite .",

    "in this section we apply the above defined algorithms to some real topologies to construct an ensemble of randomized networks ( also known as _ surrogate data _ in other scientific communities ) preserving the defined topological invariants .",
    "first of all , we need to define proper measures to evaluate the level of randomness of our systems .",
    "as it is described above , randomizations are subject to very restrictive constraints since not all ( un)-directed degree sequence configurations are graphical .",
    "therefore , the success of dag randomization processes must be properly evaluated .",
    "two estimators were measured for this purpose .",
    "first , a _ dissimilarity _",
    "parameter @xmath104 is proposed to measure how the graph evolves along the iterations with respect to the original one .",
    "second , the deterioration of present degree - degree relations is also reported by means of an estimator borrowed from information theory , the so - called _ joint entropy _ @xcite .",
    "the dissimilarity parameter @xmath105 between two graphs is the relative frequency of link mismatches between them , i.e. , the _ hamming distance _ of their adjacency matrices . in the context of a randomization process ,",
    "let us define @xmath106 and @xmath107 as the adjacency matrices of an original graph ( @xmath6 ) and the graph resulting from the application of @xmath108 randomization iterations ( @xmath109 ) , respectively .",
    "their dissimilarity can be expressed as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the kronecker s delta and @xmath112 denotes the number of links of both @xmath6 and @xmath109 , since the undirected degree sequence is preserved in the four randomization methods .",
    "given two random variables , @xmath113 , the _ joint entropy _ between @xmath114 and @xmath115 , @xmath116 is given by : @xmath117 being @xmath118 the joint probability of the pair of outcomes @xmath119 happening together -throughout this paper @xmath120 will be used .",
    "let us detail how every concept is translated in a useful way to become graph measures .",
    "joint entropy for the evaluation of degree - degree relations can be expressed as @xmath121 where @xmath122 defines the probability of finding a randomly selected link that connects two nodes @xmath123 such that @xmath124 .",

    "any directed degree analyses . in this sense",
    ", degree - degree joint entropy provides a suitable measure of the relation or determinism of degree - degree relations with neither parametric assumptions nor degree - degree variance requisites .",
    "accordingly , we used the concept of degree - degree relations instead of degree - degree correlations.[footmethod ] ] the subscript `` @xmath126 '' emphasizes that such a measure does not take into account the directed nature of the graph .",
    "joint entropy quantifications for degree - degree considering the directed degree sequence can be easily derived . in this case",
    "three additional joint entropies attending directedness can be considered , namely the ones accounting for @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 relations .",
    "although more elaborated definitions of this probability can be proposed , for the sake of simplicity we assessed whether two nodes with given degrees tend to be connected , not matter the direction of the arrow connecting them .",

    "values of @xmath149 means that the degree - degree relations at the original network @xmath24 are significantly low respect to the @xmath148distribution of its random ensemble .",
    "finally , values within the range @xmath150 $ ] indicate that no significant differences in the degree - degree relations were found between the original graph and its randomized ensemble .",
    "analogously , we can compute @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 and its associated @xmath142-scores at the step @xmath108 of the randomization process .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ , < , < , < , < \" , ]     table [ real_data2 ] displays statistically significant low joint - entropy values , indicating that this dag has relevant undirected degree - degree relations with respect to all their randomized ensembles .",
    "it also displays a statistically relevant indegree - indegree and outdegree - outdegree relations with respect to all their randomized ensembles . in the case of indegree - outdegree , it shows significant relations with respect to the randomized ensembles produced by methods @xmath47 and @xmath154 , while there were no differences respect to the randomized ensembles produced by methods @xmath155 and @xmath98 .",
    "this result indicates that indegree - outdegree relations in the phd student - advisor network are high with respect to the random dags that preserve only the undirected degree sequence and are not differentiable from the ones obtained by random dags that also preserve the directed degree sequence .",
    "in this paper we present a set of four algorithms based on an iterative process of rewiring for the construction of dag random models .",
    "the difference between algorithms stems from two topological invariants under consideration , namely , the conservation of the directed degree sequence and/or the conservation of the connected component distribution .",
    "in contrast to other methods of random model construction , this approach works within the space of _ graphical _ solutions providing a feasible computational approximation for the exploration of such a graphical space considering a defined number of topological invariants in the null - model ensemble generation .",
    "our methodology was evaluated through the analyses of both extreme and real graphs comparing them with their associated randomized ensembles using two measures : dissimilarity and joint entropy . while the former indicates whether connections are actually changed after randomization , the latter quantifies the _ disorder _ or uncertainty in the degree - degree relations , thereby being an indicator of randomness . in this context , it is worth to mention that other measures such assortative mixing @xcite or mutual information @xcite have been suggested for the evaluation of degree - degree relations .",
    "in essence , these measures compare the actual degree correlations relation in the graph with the expected one obtained from the _ remaining degree _ information .",
    "a problem arises when a proper definition of remaining degree attending directedness needs of the information of the directed degree sequence because of the latter is a topological feature not preserved in all of our methods ( methods @xmath156 and @xmath157 ) .",
    "therefore , measures based on remaining degree information , although extensively used as estimators of degree - degree relations in the network literature @xcite can not be applied in this work for a comparative evaluation of our methodology .    to overcome these limitations ,",
    "joint entropy was used as a raw measure of uncertainty once defined to be applied to directed graphs leading to four alternative descriptors according to in and out - degree information .",
    "furthermore , the significance of the variation of degree - degree relations between the random ensembles and the original graph was evaluated using a z - score estimator .",
    "the analysis of network models verified that our methods do not produce a bias when applied to the _",
    "random_-dag model whilst they produced a significative increase of disorder of the degree - degree relations on the _ snake_-dag model when randomized -see table [ table_snake ] .",
    "going to real systems , our analyses revealed that all the methods produced an @xmath158 greater than its respective original value , suggesting that randomizations disorder the underlying graph and they do not only affect the pattern of arrows .",
    "however , values of undirected joint entropies are different among methods , suggesting that conservation of the dag condition and the remaining topological invariants have a variable impact on the underlying network .",
    "when we look at the _ directed _ joint entropies a general increase of the values was observed for all of methods , although some exceptions are observed .",
    "this is the case of phd student - advisor network where the original network exibits a diversity of degree - degree relations higher than the randomized ensemble .",
    "additionaly , our results show that preserving the component size structure is an important aspect to take into account since it has drammatic effects when the network is markedly sparse .",
    "this is the case of _ c. elegans _ and phd student - advisor dags by which randomizations not preserving the component size produced a graph fragmentation . on the contrary",
    ", high average degree guarantees the preservation of the giant component and randomization methods . in such circumstances , methods @xmath156 and @xmath157 give comparable values of joint entropies .",
    "analogously , this is also sobserved for method @xmath77 and @xmath159 ( see joint entropy for network models and also for the milgram s citation network ) .",
    "this feature indicates that the conservation of component structure premise is not relevant and produce indistinguisable topologies when graph fragmentation is unlike to happen .",
    "another important observation is related to the small values displayed by standard deviations in joint entropies . for methods @xmath77 and @xmath159 are one order of magnitud lower than the ones obtained for methods @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "it suggests that just directed degree sequence conservation is enough to severely reduce the space of graphical configurations .",
    "consistenly , it was observed that , in general , methods @xmath77 and @xmath159 provided lower z - values than @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "however , the small divergence of the obtained values is not explained by a non - effective rewiring since high values of dissimilarity were reached .",
    "an interesting exception was found in the milgram s citation network where dissimilarity values after processes of randomization were markedly lower than the observed in the other real networks , as well as in the toy models .",
    "an explanation can be found in the presence of _ superhubs _ , nodes whose connectivity is @xmath160 .",
    "this introduces a strong constraint in the rewiring , difficult -even impossible- to overcome . nevertheless figure ( [ citations ] )",
    "illustrates that the original network seems to be partitioned in two regions .",
    "using the same layout for randomized graphs , we observed that such a partition was lost , suggesting that rewiring process was accounted .",
    "contrasting to this behaviour , _",
    "c. elegans _ randomized ensembles were completely suffled -as indicated by the high values of dissimilarity- but degree - degree relations were not always significatively altered .",
    "this is specially evident when directed degree sequence is conserved .",
    "an explanation can be obtained by the fact that this dag is practically a dichotomic tree .",
    "this network is sparse enough to be fragmented as it happened in method @xmath157 .",
    "nevertheless , preserving its extremal directed degree sequence was enough to conserve the number of components ( not their size though ) .",
    "this is in aggreement to the constraint in the number of dag components described in eq .",
    "( [ boundary ] ) .",
    "in fact , this is a result of the limited space of possibilities permited by the extremal directed degree sequence and therefore very little variation is found in the joint entropies ( notice the case of zero @xmath161 for method @xmath77 ) .",
    "interestingly , when directed degree sequence and component structure are not preserved , tree configuration is unlikely to happen by chance . however , tree structure is practically the only solution when directed degree sequence is preserved even not conserving the component size distribution .    the choice of topological constraints ( i.e. the particular method ) for a desired randomization process depends upon the question the researcher wants to explore , rather than upon a technical issue . preserving",

    "<S> a highly ordered dag , called _ snake_-graph and a erdos - rnyi dag were used to validate the performance of the algorithms . finally , three real case studies , namely , the _ c. elegans _ cell lineage network , a phd student - advisor network and the milgram s citation network were analyzed using each randomization method . </S>",

    "<S> in general , real dags provide disordered values , lower than the expected by chance when the directedness of the links is not preserved in the randomization process . </S>",
