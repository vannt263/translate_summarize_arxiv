    "high - energy spin physics has been going through a period of great popularity and rapid developments ever since the measurement of the proton s spin - dependent deep - inelastic structure function @xmath3 by the emc  @xcite more than a decade ago . as a result of combined experimental and theoretical efforts",
    ", we have gained some fairly precise information concerning , for example , the total quark spin contribution to the nucleon spin . yet , many other interesting and important questions , most of which came up in the wake of the emc measurement , remain unanswered so far , the most prominent `` unknown '' being the nucleon s spin - dependent gluon density , @xmath4 .",
    "also , polarized _ inclusive _ deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) data do not provide enough information for a complete separation of the distributions for the different quark and anti - quark flavors @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . here in particular a possible flavor asymmetry in the nucleon s light sea , @xmath7 , has attracted quite some interest , and several models have been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "current and future dedicated spin experiments are expected to vastly broaden our understanding of the nucleon spin structure by studying reactions that give further access to its spin - dependent parton distributions , among them @xmath4 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "in addition to lepton - nucleon scattering , there will also be for the first time information coming from very inelastic polarized @xmath0 collisions at the bnl relativistic heavy - ion collider rhic  @xcite .",
    "having available at some point in the near future spin data on various different reactions , one needs to tackle the question of how to determine the polarized parton densities from the data .",
    "of course , this problem is not at all new : in the unpolarized case , several groups perform such `` global analyses '' of the plethora of data available there  @xcite .",
    "the strategy is in principle clear : an ansatz for the parton distributions at some initial scale @xmath10 , given in terms of appropriate functional forms with a set of free parameters , is evolved to a scale @xmath11 relevant for a certain data point for a certain cross section .",
    "then the parton densities at scale @xmath11 are used to compute the theoretical prediction for the cross section , and a @xmath12 value is assigned that represents the quality of the comparison to the experimental point .",
    "this is done for all data points to be included in the analysis , and subsequently the parameters in the ansatz for the parton distribution functions are varied , until eventually a minimum in @xmath12 is reached .    in practice , this approach is not fully viable if the partonic scattering is treated beyond the lowest order of perturbation theory .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the hadronic cross section at higher orders is usually a rather time - consuming procedure as it often requires several tedious numerical integrations , not only for the convolutions with the parton densities , but also for the phase space integrations in the partonic cross section .",
    "the fitting procedure outlined above , on the other hand , usually requires thousands of computations of the cross section for any given data point , and so the computing time required for a fit easily becomes excessive even on modern workstations .",
    "we note that for practically all reactions of interest in the unpolarized and polarized cases the first - order qcd corrections to the respective partonic cross sections are known by now .",
    "they are generally indispensable in order to arrive at a firmer theoretical prediction for hadronic cross sections ; for instance the dependence on the unphysical factorization and renormalization scales is reduced when going to higher orders in the perturbative expansion . only then can one reliably extract information on the parton distribution functions .    in the unpolarized case ,",
    "a way to get around this problem is based on the fact that the parton densities are already known here rather accurately  @xcite .",
    "their gross features are basically determined by the wealth of very precise dis data which cover a wide kinematical range in the momentum fraction @xmath13 and the scale @xmath14 . as a consequence ,",
    "the theory answer for a certain cross section is expected to change in a very predictable way when going from the lowest - order born level to the first - order approximation .",
    "it is then possible to pre - calculate a set of correction factors @xmath15 ( @xmath16 running over the data points ) , and to simply multiply them in each step of the fitting procedure to the _ lowest - order _ approximation for the cross section , the latter being usually much faster to evaluate than that involving higher order terms .",
    "the @xmath15 usually hardly change at all from one set of parton distributions to another , and in any case one may update them if necessary at certain stages of the fitting procedure",
    ".    it should be noted , however , that this way of treating next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections in a fit is not necessarily adequate in all cases of interest . in particular",
    "if one is interested in extracting information about the gluon density at large values of @xmath13 , where it is only rather poorly constrained at the moment , the correction factors @xmath15 can not be reliably pre - calculated , and they may vary considerably during the fitting procedure .",
    "it is therefore desirable to incorporate nlo cross sections without any approximations in future analyses of parton densities .    in the polarized case it is in general",
    "not at all clear whether a strategy based on correction factors @xmath15 will work . here",
    ", the parton densities are known with _",
    "much _ less accuracy so far .",
    "it is therefore not possible to pre - calculate higher - order correction factors that one would be able to keep fixed throughout the fit , while using `` fast '' lowest - order expressions for the partonic cross sections .",
    "for instance , even though it is well known that for a sizable @xmath4 the @xmath17 compton subprocess is the dominant contributor to the transverse momentum distribution of a `` prompt '' photon in the kinematical region of interest , this is by no means the case if @xmath4 happens to be small , in which case all other channels , even genuine nlo ones , may become equally important .",
    "in addition , the spin - dependent parton distributions , as well as the polarized partonic cross sections , may have zeros in the kinematical regions of interest , near which the predictions at lowest order and the next order will show marked differences . therefore , even if the correction factors are updated at times during the fitting procedure , the convergence of the fit is not warranted .",
    "conversely , if one updates the @xmath15 frequently , the fit will become too slow again .",
    "clearly , in the polarized case , the goal _ must _ be to find a way of implementing efficiently , and without approximations , the _ exact _ nlo expression for any hadronic cross section such as the prompt photon cross section into the fitting procedure .",
    "as will be shown in the next section , this can be achieved in a very simple and straightforward way by going to mellin-@xmath18 moment space .",
    "a technique of this sort was first used for the case of jet production in dis as a means of extracting information about the unpolarized gluon density @xcite . the relevant generalization to hadron - hadron scattering , which is more involved and requires a `` double mellin transform '' was recently provided in @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite focuses on the formalism and the technical aspects of the mellin transformation , rather than on its actual practicability , and the usefulness in a global qcd analysis has never been demonstrated .",
    "before we demonstrate in some detail the potential of the mellin technique in praxis for two examples relevant for future global analyses of polarized parton densities , which is the main thrust of this paper , we start off in the next section by rederiving the required formalism in an easy and transparent way . in section 3",
    "we will consider first the semi - inclusive production of hadrons in polarized dis as the simplest application of the mellin technique .",
    "the @xmath18 moments of the partonic cross sections can be taken analytically in this case .",
    "due to the subsequent fragmentation of a final state parton into the observed hadron , semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) is sensitive to different flavor combinations than inclusive dis data .",
    "it has also the advantage that we have already data at our disposal @xcite which can be analysed in terms of a possible flavor asymmetry @xmath19 of the light sea .",
    "as a second example we study the production of a prompt photon at high transverse momentum @xmath20 in @xmath0 collisions at rhic in section 4 .",
    "its sensitivity to the gluon distribution via the lo compton subprocess , which , along with the cleanliness of the prompt photon signal , is the reason why this process will be the flagship measurement of @xmath4 at rhic  @xcite . as a first case study for future global analyses we also carry out a `` toy '' analysis of dis _ and _ projected prompt photon data to highlight the power of future rhic @xmath0 data to pin down @xmath4 .",
    "we briefly summarize the main results in section 5 .",
    "the factorization theorem  @xcite ensures that in the presence of a hard scale in a reaction the corresponding ( spin - dependent ) hadronic cross section can be written as a sum over `` convolutions '' of parton densities with partonic hard - scattering cross sections .",
    "the latter are perturbatively calculable and are specific to the reaction under consideration .",
    "the parton distributions , which for spin - dependent interactions contain the desired information on the nucleon s spin structure , depend on long - distance phenomena .",
    "however , they are universal : a single set of distributions for ( anti-)quarks @xmath21 and gluons @xmath22 , predicts all data sets simultaneously .    to be specific , for a general spin - dependent cross section in longitudinally polarized @xmath0 collisions , differential in a certain observable @xmath23 and integrated over experimental bins in other kinematical variables @xmath24 , one has @xmath25 \\\\[2 mm ] % & = &   % \\sum_{a , b , c}\\ , \\int_{\\mathrm exp - bin } dt\\ ,   \\int_{x_a^{\\mathrm min}}^1 dx_a   \\int_{x_b^{\\mathrm min}}^1 dx_b   \\int_{z_c^{\\mathrm min}}^1 dz_c \\,\\ , \\delta f_a ( x_a,\\mu_f ) \\,\\delta f_b ( x_b,\\mu_f )   d_c^h(z_c,\\mu_f ' ) \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ [ 2 mm ] % & & % \\times \\,\\frac{d\\delta \\hat{\\sigma}_{ab}^{c}}{do dt } ( x_ap_a , x_bp_b , p_h / z_c , t , \\mu_r , \\mu_f , \\mu_f ' ) \\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the arguments @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the first line of eq .",

    "the @xmath36 represent the unpolarized fragmentation functions .",
    "they parameterize the probability that a parton @xmath37 fragments into the observed final state @xmath38 , e.g. , a charged pion , with momentum @xmath39 . for some observables , such as ( di-)jets ,",
    "there is no need for a fragmentation function in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the scales @xmath11 and @xmath40 are the factorization scales for initial and final state collinear singularities , respectively , and reflect the certain amount of arbitrariness in the separation of short - distance and long - distance physics embodied in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "even though the parton densities ( fragmentation functions ) can not presently be derived from first principles , their dependence on @xmath11 ( @xmath40 ) is calculable perturbatively in terms of the `` dglap '' evolution equations  @xcite , allowing to relate their values at one scale to their values at any other @xmath11 ( @xmath40 ) .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) by simply setting @xmath46 .",
    "we will consider this example in some detail in section 3 as it is the simplest application of the mellin moment technique which we are going to advocate in the following as a straightforward tool to extract information about parton densities from a global qcd analysis .",
    "for the polarized parton distribution functions , the mellin moments are defined as f_i^n ( ) _ 0 ^ 1 dx x^n-1 f_i(x , ) .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the evolution equations for the the parton densities become particularly simple in mellin-@xmath18 space , since the convolutions occuring in the @xmath13-space equations factorize into simple products under moments .",
    "this allows for a straightforward analytic solution of the differential evolution equations , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in fact , several of the nlo evolution codes used for parton density analyses in the unpolarized and polarized cases are set up in mellin-@xmath18 space . after evolving from one scale to another in moment space ,",
    "the evolved parton distributions in bjorken-@xmath13 space are recovered by an inverse mellin transform , given by [ eq6 ] f_i(x , ) = _ c_n dn x^-n f_i^n ( ) , where @xmath47 denotes a contour in the complex @xmath18 plane that has an imaginary part ranging from @xmath48 to @xmath49 and that intersects the real axis to the right of the rightmost poles of the @xmath50 .",
    "the evolution of the time - like fragmentation functions can be treated in a very similar way in mellin space as well .",
    "the crucial , but simple , step in applying moment techniques to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is to express the @xmath51 by their mellin inverses in eq .",

    "we emphasize that all the tedious and time - consuming integrations are already dealt with in the calculation of the @xmath53 .",
    "we have included the integration over the fragmentation function @xmath56 and the summation over the final state parton @xmath37 in the definition of the pre - calculated quantities @xmath57 .",
    "this also implies that @xmath57 does not depend anymore on the choice for @xmath40 apart from some residual dependence which is of higher order in @xmath58 .",
    "usually the fragmentation functions are taken from `` elsewhere '' , i.e. , @xmath59 data , rather than being fitted simultaneously with the parton densities .",
    "we note , however , that one can also replace @xmath56 by their mellin inverse according to eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) . in that case",
    "the pre - calculated quantities would depend on three mellin variables .",
    "the double inverse mellin transformation which finally links the parton distributions with the pre - calculated @xmath53 of course still needs to be performed _ in each step _ of the fitting procedure .",
    "however , the integrations over @xmath18 and @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) are extremely fast to perform by choosing the values for @xmath60 in @xmath53 on the contours @xmath47 , @xmath61 simply as the supports for a gaussian integration .",
    "the point here is that the integrand in @xmath18 and @xmath54 falls off very rapidly as @xmath62 and @xmath63 increase along the contour , for two reasons : first , each parton distribution function is expected to fall off at least as a power @xmath64 at large @xmath13 , which in moment space converts into a fall - off of @xmath65 or higher .",
    "secondly , we may choose contours in moment space that are bent by an angle @xmath66 with respect to the vertical direction ; a possible choice is shown in fig .",
    "then , for large @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath18 and @xmath54 will acquire large negative real parts , so that @xmath67 and @xmath68 decrease exponentially along the respective contours .",
    "this helps for the numerical convergence of the calculation of the @xmath53 and also gives them a rapid fall - off at large arguments .",
    "we note that no new poles in @xmath18 and @xmath54 , beyond those already present in the moments of the parton distribution functions , are introduced by the @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "we note that if one wishes to integrate also over an experimental bin in @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , a potential complication arises if the hard scale @xmath11 in the parton distribution functions depends explicitly on @xmath23 .",
    "this makes it impossible to straightforwardly include the @xmath23 integration in the pre - calculation of the @xmath57 .",
    "a typical example for @xmath23 , which often appears in practice , is the transverse momentum @xmath20 of an observed jet , hadron , or prompt photon . in this case , the @xmath23 dependence of @xmath11 is , however , not a serious limitation  @xcite : the logarithmic dependence of the parton densities on @xmath11 is much weaker than the overall @xmath20 dependence of the cross section . therefore , it is always possible to choose a bin - average of @xmath20 as the scale in the parton densities .",
    "alternatively , one could choose not to include the @xmath20 integration in the @xmath69 and to construct grids of somewhat larger size , taken at a small number of support points for a simple gaussian integration over the @xmath20 bin .",
    "a further possibility @xcite is to absorb also the evolution of the parton densities from their initial scale @xmath10 to @xmath11 into the @xmath57 , which in moment space simply enters in the form of exponentials involving the anomalous dimensions , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this procedure , which is somewhat more involved , would eliminate any complication related to @xmath70 .",
    "anyway , the experiments will usually quote results for the @xmath20-_differential _ cross section at the @xmath20-average over the bin , which of course is exactly what we have considered in eqs .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , ( [ eq8 ] ) . in the latter case",
    "it is also easily possible to organize the grids in such a way that the renormalization and/or factorization scales can be varied during the fit , by simply taking the ( logarithmic ) dependence on @xmath71 and the strong coupling @xmath72 out of the partonic cross sections beforehand .    as a technical sidestep",
    ", we give an explicit expression for the double inverse transform in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) for the contours depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . to this end",
    ", we parameterize the various segments in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by @xmath73 where @xmath74 $ ] and the sign of @xmath75 has to be chosen appropriately for the branches of the contours .",
    "we then find [ eq10 ] & = & - _ a , b re , where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate , and where we have made use of @xmath76 , since the @xmath77 are real functions .",
    "this identity also implies that there is no need to separately compute the moments of the parton densities at the complex conjugate values @xmath78 , which has a further positive effect on the computing time required for performing the mellin inverses .",
    "in addition , there is no need to provide separate grids for @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    before proceeding , we reemphasize that the idea outlined above of reverting to mellin moment space in the implementation of any higher - order cross section into parton density fits is not entirely new , but was first developed in refs .",
    "the example considered in @xcite was jet production in dis , which offers the simplification of being only linear in the parton distribution functions .",
    "there is a difference between our approach and that of ref .",
    "@xcite in practical terms : in the language of our example in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , ref .",
    "@xcite would insert a factor @xmath81 in the integrands for the @xmath82 and @xmath83 integrations , while undoing this operation through a factor @xmath84 in the @xmath18 and @xmath54 integrands . even though obviously equivalent mathematically",
    ", the disadvantage of this procedure is that the resulting factors @xmath85 , @xmath86 in the @xmath82 , @xmath83 integrands will now _ grow _ exponentially along the contours in mellin space , making it numerically much more cumbersome  @xcite to perform the @xmath82 and @xmath83 integrations yielding the @xmath87 . as a matter of fact , the actual extension of the method of ref .",

    "@xcite is the choice of the contour .",
    "reference @xcite fully exploits the freedom in deforming the contours for the inverse mellin transform and constructs a `` surface of steepest descent '' which in principle has the best numerical convergence properties but is difficult to parameterize .",
    "instead we stick to the simple contours in fig .  [ fig1 ]",

    "we have used again the polarized parton densities of  @xcite ( `` standard '' set ) . for a more detailed comparison ,",
    "we split up the contributions to the nlo prompt photon cross section into three parts , associated with the reactions @xmath161 and @xmath162 that are already present at born level , and all other processes that arise only at nlo .",
    "one notices that in each case already a grid size of @xmath163 values yields excellent accuracy .",
    "even a @xmath164 grid is acceptable apart from a minor deviation occuring for @xmath165 scattering in the vicinty of a zero in the partonic cross section .",
    "we have checked that the results in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] do not depend on the actual choice of parton densities .",
    "the crucial asset of the mellin method is the speed at which one can calculate the full hadronic cross section , once the grids @xmath166 have been pre - calculated . for the @xmath167 grid , we found that 1000 evaluations of the full nlo prompt photon cross section take only about 10 - 15 seconds on a standard workstation .",
    "note that this number includes the evolution ( in moment space ) of the parton distributions from their input scale to the scale @xmath20 relevant to this case .",
    "clearly , an implementation into a full parton density fitting procedure is now readily possible .    to give an example",
    ", we finally perform a `` toy '' global analysis of the available data on polarized dis  @xcite and of _ fictitious _ data on prompt photon production at rhic  @xcite , which we project by simply calculating @xmath168 in eq .",

    "the `` data '' , as well as the underlying theoretical calculation of @xmath168 based on the spin - dependent parton densities of @xcite ( solid line ) , are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "next , we perform a large number of fits to the full , _ dis plus projected prompt photon _ , data set .",
    "we simultaneously fit _ all _ polarized parton densities , ( anti)quarks and gluons , choosing the distributions of @xcite as the input for the @xmath170 , @xmath171 , but using randomly chosen values for the parameters in the ansatz for the polarized gluon distribution at the input scale @xmath10 . regarding the details of the evolution",
    ", we stay again within the setup of  @xcite , but we choose a more flexible ansatz for the polarized gluon density , @xmath172 which also allows for a zero in the @xmath13-shape of @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath173 is the unpolarized gluon density  @xcite at the input scale of @xcite .",
    "note that the functional form for the polarized gluon density of  @xcite , used for generating our pseudo - data , is included in eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) for @xmath174 .",
    "each fit takes only about @xmath175 minutes .",
    "ideally , thanks to the strong sensitivity of the prompt photon reaction to @xmath4 , the gluon density in each fit should return close to the function we assumed when calculating the fictitious prompt photon `` data '' , in the region of @xmath13 probed by the data . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , this happens .",
    "the shaded band illustrates the deviations of the gluon densities obtained from the global fits to the `` reference @xmath4 '' @xcite used in generating the pseudo - data .",
    "it should be stressed that only those fits are admitted to the band that give a good simultaneous description of the dis _ and _ @xmath168 data .",
    "here we have tolerated a maximum increase of the total @xmath12 by up to four units from its minimum value .",
    "the shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) shows the corresponding variations in @xmath168 .",
    "as is expected , all gluon densities are rather tightly constrained in the @xmath13-region dominantly probed by the prompt photon data .",
    "this is true in particular at @xmath176 , as a result of the most precise data point for @xmath168 at @xmath177 .",
    "we note that one can also easily include the sidis data discussed in section 3 into the global analysis without any significant increase of computing time for each fit .",
    "however , so far these data have no impact on our results . to illustrate our _ present _ ignorance of @xmath4 , fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) shows also two extreme gluon densities with first moments @xmath178 ( dotted lines ) , which are both in perfect agreement with all presently available dis data .",
    "the corresponding predictions for @xmath168 for these two sets are given in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "it should be noted that future measurements of @xmath168 at rhic at @xmath179 and for similar @xmath20 values of the prompt photon would further reduce the uncertainties on @xmath4 in the @xmath13-region between 0.05 and 0.1 . although our analysis still contains a certain bias by choosing only the framework of @xcite for the fits as well as by our choice of what @xmath12 values are still tolerable , it clearly outlines the potential and importance of upcoming measurements of @xmath168 at rhic for improving our understanding of the spin structure of the nucleon , in particular of its spin - dependent gluon density .",
    "to conclude , we have presented and applied a powerful technique for implementing in a fast way , and without any approximations , higher - order calculations of partonic cross sections into global analyses of parton distribution functions .",
    "we have demonstrated that the approach works in practice for two examples : sidis and prompt photon production in @xmath0 collisions . in the first case it was possible to perform the mellin",
    "transform analytically and we have provided all necessary technical details for future analyses of polarized and unpolarized sidis data . for polarized prompt photon production",
    "we have presented a case study for a future global analysis based on fictitious data .",
