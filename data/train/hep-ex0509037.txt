    "the standard model of elementary particles and fundamental interactions ( from now on standard model or sm ) has been very successfull to describe the subnuclear world . given this succes one would wonder why should we look at any theory beyond the standard model ( bsm ) at all .",
    "there are several _ theory oriented _ answers to this question , from the hyerarchy problem to the stability of the higgs sector , to the number of generations , just to name a few . in my view , however , most important are some hints of open questions . what is the nature of the cold dark matter ( now that we have an indirect cosmological proof of its existence ) .",
    "why neutrinos have masses ? is there a unification of the coupling constants before the planck scale ? finally , while the sm has been succesful we still do not have a way to marry quantum theory with gravity , let alone to unify gravity with the other interactions .    an optimal place to look for new phenomena",
    "is the energy frontier which , at the moment , is explored by the experiments h1 and zeus at the hera collider at desy near hamburg  @xcite , where proton and electron ( or positron ) collide at @xmath0 gev / c@xmath1 and at the tevatron ( experiments cdf and d0 ) where proton and antiproton collide at the highest energy ( 1.96 tev ) currently available  @xcite . in the near future",
    "that frontier will be throughly explored by the lhc , currently being built at cern .",
    "most of the results presented were obtained at the tevatron where the goal of 1 fb@xmath2 delivered per experiment was exceeded in may 2005 .",
    "current scenarios predict between 4 and 8 fb @xmath2 delivered ( per experiment ) by 2009 .",
    "this exploration physics proceeds mainly through comparison of data with sm expectations . as _ new physics _ ( np ) is anything which is beyond the standard model , the best experimental way to look for it in a model independent way is to select observables that can be affected by np and then compare measurements with sm expectations .",
    "it takes a lot of ingenuity but it also implies that in those searches we will be studying familiar physics objects .",
    "hadronic jets , charged and neutral leptons are the basic tool .   through this paper , unless otherwise indicated , 95 % c.l .",
    "limits will be reported .",
    "although tested to a very good accuracy , the sm is incomplete as the higgs particle , a cornerstone of the theory , has not been discovered .",
    "the best limit for its mass , a free parameter of the theory , @xmath3 @xmath4 , is due to the lep experiments . at this mass",
    "the higgs decays into two @xmath5 quarks most of the time . at the moment",
    "the hunt for higgs takes place at the tevatron , where most of the production cross section is via @xmath6 fusion ( @xmath7 pb at the lep limit ) . at low higgs masses",
    "( @xmath8 gev / c@xmath1 ) the signal is swamped by the much larger heavy flavour production . from an experimental point of view , at low mass , the associated production of vector boson ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) to higgs ( @xmath11 pb ) has a clean signature and a better s / b ratio .",
    "cdf and d0 searched for the sm higgs in a large mass range , exploiting different channels .",
    "the negative searches can be summarized in a single plot ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tevhiggs ] ) where recent results obtained with @xmath12 pb@xmath2 are shown  @xcite .",
    "the scalar nature of the higgs particle brings itself some technical problems to the sm .",
    "its mass gets large corrections which must cancel out . over the years",
    "this problem has been tackled in many ways , the most popular solution being the supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "the idea , borrowed from the particle - antiparticle symmetry , is that there is shadow world of ( super)particles . for any fermion a scalar partner would exist , while for each spin 0,1 particle a ( s)fermion would exist  @xcite .",
    "clearly the symmetry is broken , as we do not have seen any sparticle .",
    "the nature of susy breaking is unknown , and there are several possible scenarios .",
    "however , all of them predict an enlarged higgs sector ( the single higgs doublet of the sm is replaced by two ) .",
    "also , in most models the assumption is that quantity @xmath13 is conserved .",
    "that implies that in the final state the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) will escape detection leaving a typical @xmath14-like signature of missing energy .",
    "susy is strongly constrained by the ( negative ) findings of the lep experiments .",
    "masses of the sparticle are large therefore currently , the best place to look for susy is the tevatron where typical cross sections are @xmath15 pb . due to the unknown nature of the symmetry breaking mechanism , the analyses are ( mostly)aimed to specific channels / breaking mechanisms .",
    "( positive @xmath16 case ) . ]      in the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) , higgs production can be enhanced , with respect to the sm case , for large @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the ratio of the v.e.v of the two higgs doublets ) .",
    "there are five higgs particles in the model ( h , h , a and @xmath19 ) , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 indicate a light ( heavy ) neutral higgs and a a neutral pseudoscalar . in this model",
    "the branching fraction for @xmath22 channel can be as large as @xmath23 8 % .",
    "cdf developed a @xmath24 identification algorithm which yielded an @xmath22 global efficiency of about @xmath25 for the @xmath26 decay channel where @xmath27 indicates an @xmath28 or @xmath16 . exploiting its dataset of 310",
    "pb@xmath2 cdf searched for the _ h_(or _",
    "h _ ) and _ a _ particle ( produced by @xmath6 or @xmath29 ) decaying into @xmath24 pairs .",
    "they found 236 events where 263@xmath30 30.1 were predicted  @xcite .",
    "the negative search is translated into a limit set within the framework of the mssm ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mssmh ] ) ) . with 1 fb@xmath2 or more",
    ", cdf expects to be able to explore the region down to @xmath31 for @xmath32 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mssmh ] .      exploiting the large production cross section for chargino and neutralino associated production , both experiments performed several searches",
    "the golden channel is the one in which there are three charged leptons in the final states , associated to the presence of large missing @xmath33 ( signature of the lsp escaping detection ) .",
    "the low background and easy triggering on this channel is somewhat balanced by the need for good acceptance .",
    ".d0 search for chargino in trilepton channels.@xmath27 indicates an high @xmath34 isolated track . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     d0 also analized its dilepton samples ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) looking for effects due to _ preons _ , the putative elementary constituents of quarks and leptons .",
    "the effects are parametrized in terms of @xmath37 , the compositness scale . as for the led case ,",
    "the search compared the spectrum invariant mass and scattering angle of data with sm expectations .",
    "the parametrization used is : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are input from theory and express the possibility of constructive / destructive interference .",
    "the negative result is used to set limits on the fundamental scale @xmath37 .",
    "limit is @xmath41 tev for constructive(destructive ) interference in the electron channel in 271 pb@xmath2 . in the muon channel ,",
    "using 400 pb@xmath2 the limit is stronger and set to @xmath42tev for constructive(destructive ) interference .",
    "the fermionic sector of the sm can be symmetrized by the introduction of still unknown particles -leptoquarks ( lq)- carrying both barionic and leptonic numbers and coupling to both quarks and leptons .",
    "relevant parameters for the theory are the couplings , @xmath43 and the decays branching fractions , which are ordered according to the bf into charged leptons ( @xmath44 ) which can vary between 1 and 0 .    at hera",
    "first generation lqs can be produced in resonant process .",
    "both h1 and zeus searched for signals of lq production in their cc and nc samples .",
    "no signal is found and limits are set . due to the way lqs",
    "are produced those limits are a function of the lq mass and of the couplings . in fig .",
    "[ fig : h1lq ] we show the result from h1 which , for a coupling strength @xmath45 is @xmath46 gev / c@xmath1 .        at the tevatron",
    "both experiments searched for scalar lqs in all generations .",
    "as lqs are pair - produced , the actual measurement can be one of the following : @xmath47 , @xmath48,@xmath49 , depending upon the bf into charged leptons .",
    "the latter channel has a final state of two jets and met and the analysis performed is generation - independent .",
    "cdf report a negative result in this channel and set a limit , using 191 pb@xmath2 , to @xmath50 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "more interesting are the results for first and second generation lq . in those cases",
    "both experiments analized their samples @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 where @xmath54,@xmath16 .",
    "cdf reports a negative result and set limits , for @xmath55 to @xmath56 gev / c@xmath1 for 1@xmath57 ( 2@xmath58 ) generation lq in 200 pb@xmath2 .",
    "d0 combines its negative results in 250 pb@xmath2 ( 1@xmath57 ) and 294 pb@xmath2 ( 2@xmath58 ) generation with run i results and set limits for @xmath55 to @xmath59 gev / c@xmath1 for 1@xmath57(2@xmath58 ) generation lq ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : d0flq ] ,  [ fig : d0slq ] ) .",
    "cdf searched for direct production of 3@xmath60 generation lq in an analysis which also set limits on rpv susy stop production .",
    "as @xmath61 events are found in 200 pb@xmath2 , where 5 are expected a limit is set @xmath62 129 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "a number of searches for signals of physics beyond the sm are ongoing .",
    "while their current findings do not support evidence of such processes , a very exciting period is ahead of us .",
    "the expectations of cdf and d0 to collect 4 to 8 fb@xmath2 per experiment by 2009 , as well as the lhc startup , indicate that within a few years either we will have seen signal of non - sm physics , or a number of theories will be disproved .",
