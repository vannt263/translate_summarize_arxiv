    "surface brightness distributions of external galaxies have been studied for many years but a reliable decomposition into structural components is often difficult to obtain .",
    "the reliability of models and techniques has been questioned by several authors ( kent @xcite ; schombert & bothun @xcite ; byun & freeman @xcite ) , and there are several points that need further study and refinement .",
    "first , brightness distributions have often been studied as one - dimensional ( 1-d ) radial profiles extracted by averaging along elliptical annuli ; such ellipses can deviate considerably from the actual isophotes , especially in highly inclined systems with a luminous bulge .",
    "the result provides therefore a distorted profile of the surface brightness along the major axis .",
    "second , the seeing must be properly taken into account ( c.f . ,",
    "schombert & bothun @xcite ) , especially when studying the central regions where brightness gradients are highest .",
    "third , the choice among the parametric forms of brightness distribution ( exponentials , hubble and de vaucouleurs laws , and so on ) does not depend on any physical argument , but only on their ability to fit the data .",
    "finally , the effects of internal extinction should be taken into account .",
    "the new near - infrared ( nir ) panoramic detectors have made imaging in the 1 to 2.5  regime rather straightforward with sensitivity and accuracy comparable to those attainable at optical wavelengths .",
    "the nir bandpasses have been advocated to be the ideal ones to study the characteristics of the galactic backbones , that is the stellar populations which make up the mass distribution in a galaxy ( e.g. , rix & rieke @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for this is twofold : first , the extinction is lower , by a factor of ten between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bandpasses ; and second , the emission of old stellar populations peaks in the nir .    in this context , we have undertaken a program of nir imaging of bright spiral galaxies with measured rotation curves .",
    "these images are used to decompose the luminosity distribution into bulge and disk components and then to analyze their contribution to the observed rotation curves . to overcome the methodological drawbacks mentioned above , we have developed a parametric technique to fit a two - dimensional ( 2-d ) bulge @xmath6 disk distribution to the entire image , which takes into account the effect of seeing .",
    "in addition , generalizing kent s non - parametric approach , we have developed an iterative algorithm to deduce from the 2-d brightness distribution the contributions of bulge and disk , again taking into account the seeing . in this first paper",
    ", we report the results of the structural decomposition for a restricted sample of early - type spirals ; a subsequent paper will describe the inferred mass distributions .",
    "such systems appear well suited for studies of this kind , mainly because of the relative smoothness of their disks and their ( reputedly ) lower internal extinction . on the other hand , due to the low gas content",
    ", rotation in sa s is not measured as far out as for later types , and hence they are not quite as effective for exploring dark matter properties . in several cases",
    "it has been noted that the presence of a dominant bulge might severely complicate the picture and the analysis ( kent @xcite ) ; these are galaxies with luminous bulges and slowly rising rotation curves , and some of them are also included in our sample .",
    "we selected 14 early - type spirals with observed rotation curves ( rubin et al .",
    "@xcite ; fillmore et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and with diameter @xmath7 8  arcmin . so that they could be imaged within our field of view .",

    "for each group or cluster its mean redshift was used ; the adopted distance scale implies a virgo distance modulus of 31.9 mag .",

    "galactic extinction was determined according to the burstein  heiles values given in rc3 , using the extinction curve given in cardelli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; k - corrections for redshift were calculated from the coefficients given by frogel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "color images were made by combining the @xmath10- and @xmath5-band magnitude images after first registering them to a fraction of a pixel .",
    "when the seeing differed significantly between the two bands , the higher - resolution image was degraded to the level of the lower resolution one .",

    "[ figure : all ] .",
    "as can be seen , the agreement is quite good in spite of the pointing uncertainties in the photometer profiles .",
    "for the 2-d parametric fits , we have modeled the surface brightness distribution with a generalized exponential bulge ( srsic  @xcite , sparks @xcite ) : @xmath16\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] plus an exponential thin disk : @xmath17 \\ ; .\\ ] ] @xmath18 and @xmath19 are effective ( half - light ) values , @xmath20 is the apparent bulge ellipticity , @xmath21 is a constant relating the effective brightness and radius to the exponential values ( see appendix ) . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are in arbitrary units , with origin at the galaxy s center , and @xmath22 along the major axis .",
    "the bulge is assumed to be an oblate rotational ellipsoid , coaxial with the disk , and its apparent eccentricity @xmath24 is related to the intrinsic eccentricity @xmath25 by : @xmath26    the structural parameters have been determined by fitting the photometric data to the model , convolved with a circular gaussian seeing disk of appropriate fwhm , using a @xmath27 minimization .",

    "the bulge was modeled with four different values of the exponent @xmath0 : 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ( @xmath33 for a de vaucouleurs bulge ) .",
    "we then assessed the `` quality '' of the results for each set of 2-d fits , and determined the value of @xmath0 that gave the best all - round fit , thus assigning , in effect , a shape index to the bulge .",
    "three quality indicators were considered in the assessment : the successful convergence of the process , the value of @xmath34 , and the mean absolute residual .",
    "when both @xmath10 and @xmath5 data were available , tests showed that bulge and disk decompositions and colors of the components were more stable when the two bands were fitted simultaneously .",
    "we also found no evidence for systematic scale length changes with wavelength of either component ( c.f . , evans @xcite ) .",
    "hence , when two bands were available , we performed a single fit keeping scale lengths , inclination , and bulge ellipticity the same for both bands , and letting the surface brightnesses of both components vary independently , but with constant color indexes @xmath35 and @xmath1  .",
    "the decomposition technique was extensively tested on a set of synthetic maps of axisymmetric bulge@xmath6disk distributions , covering a range of values for @xmath32 , @xmath20 , and b / d ratio similar to ours .",
    "we adopted an exponential thin disk , and generalized exponential laws for the bulge .",
    "an appropriate amount of noise was added to simulate the typical signal - to - noise levels we achieve , and finally the models were convolved with a range of psf s to simulate the effects of seeing .",
    "the 2-d decomposition method was always able to recover the true parameter set , within the estimated errors , independently of the starting point in parameter space .",
    "we also performed a 1-d fit to the radial profile , obtained by averaging along elliptical annuli ; center and position angle of the annuli were held fixed , while the ellipticity was allowed to vary with semi - major axis . in the 1-d case ,",
    "the convolution of the model with the psf requires @xmath32 and @xmath20 to be assigned a priori : as customary in 1-d techniques , @xmath20 was fixed at 0 and @xmath32 was determined from the outer @xmath10-band isophotes .",

    "kent ( @xcite ) was the first to introduce a non - parametric ( np ) method to separate bulge and disk ; recently this has been extended to the profile analysis of 2-d images by andredakis et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we propose here a new , completely 2-d technique . assuming the apparent ellipticities of the two components , @xmath20 and @xmath41 , are known ,",
    "let us consider the average surface brightness of an annulus of ellipticity , say , @xmath42 .",
    "for a sufficiently narrow annulus , @xmath43 , the disk contribution will be @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the semi - major axis",
    ". the total average brightness will be : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the annular area .",
    "an analogous equation can be written for an annulus of ellipticity @xmath20 .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ int_an ] ) can be written as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the axial ratios of the components .",
    "we then obtain for any @xmath45 , a system of integral equations : @xmath51 to solve the system we first compute @xmath52 and @xmath53 for two sets of annuli of ellipticities @xmath20 and @xmath42 , respectively , each set sampling the entire light distribution .",
    "the two equations can then be solved iteratively for @xmath54 and @xmath55 at each @xmath45 , starting with @xmath56 and @xmath57 as initial guesses to evaluate the integrals .    when defining the two sets of annuli , a proper sampling of the semi - major axis is of crucial importance . a reliable estimate of the integrals in eq .  [ boh ]",
    "requires that each annulus of either set intersects with a sufficient number of annuli of the other set . if we constrain this number to be the same for every ellipse , the sampling is linear in @xmath58 , i.e. the annuli become wider with increasing radius .",
    "results of the np decomposition technique are given in the third line of table [ table : parameters ] , and in the second line of table [ table : luminosities ] .",
    "the non - parametric parameters are defined as follows .",
    "the bulge @xmath19 is the semimajor axis of the ellipse enclosing half light ; @xmath29 is the bulge surface brightness at @xmath19 ; @xmath31 is the semimajor axis of the ellipse enclosing 0.264 of the disk light , as in the exponential case .",
    "since the central disk is not tightly constrained by the np fits , @xmath30 is the central brightness of an exponential disk having scale length @xmath31 and the same total luminosity as the np disk .",
    "the np colors of the components are derived by the total component luminosities in the two bands .",
    "the np decomposition algorithm was tested on the same set of synthetic maps used for the parametric tests .",
    "since the method applies only to components with different apparent ellipticity , we only tested models with @xmath20 at least 10% smaller than @xmath42 . under these conditions , to within the noise level , the method always proved to be able to recover the true bulge and disk distributions given the correct values of the ellipticities .",
    "when errors on the ellipticities are introduced , the shape of the resulting components is affected in a systematic way : the value of @xmath20 affects mainly the inner part of the disk , while @xmath42 determines the shape of the outer bulge .",
    "in particular , if @xmath20 is underestimated the inner disk is too steep , whereas if the bulge is too elliptical the inner disk develops a hole which gets deeper as @xmath20 increases .",
    "if @xmath42 is too small the outer bulge is too steep and viceversa .",
    "although qualitatively these are expected trends , they are difficult to quantify in practice , since they depend on the shapes of the distributions , on the ellipticities , and on the seeing . especially when the two components have similar ellipticities , even small errors on @xmath20 and @xmath42 ( @xmath59 ) perceptibly affect parameters such as the luminosity of the components or the b / d ratio , as well as the shape of the profiles .",
    "simulations show that , if no correction is applied , seeing significantly affects np decompositions .",
    "the effects are stronger in the inner parts , the main feature being a central hole in the disk , whose extension is proportional to the seeing width .",
    "in fact , the seeing makes inner isophotes rounder , causing the component of higher ellipticity to be depressed .",
    "the disk profile , however , can be corrected by extrapolating the outer points to the center .    to recover the intrinsic bulge profile",
    ", we introduced a second iterative algorithm which proved to be quite effective on synthetic maps .",
    "the effect of seeing is accounted for by defining a correction coefficient @xmath60 , for each point of the bulge profile , as the ratio of the convolved bulge distribution and an estimate of the true one .",
    "each decomposition is performed using @xmath60 to degrade the assumed true distribution .",
    "after decomposition , the coefficients are recomputed by convolving the extracted bulge profile with the psf , and a new decomposition is performed until both the coefficients and the profiles converge .",
    "the initial estimate of @xmath60 is provided by the convolution of the bulge profile extracted without any correction .      to determine the apparent ellipticity of the components",
    ", we extracted from each image a radial profile of the ellipticity by fitting isophotes of variable ellipticity and fixed position angle .",
    "we then selected the lowest value beyond one seeing disk from the center as @xmath20 , and the average value in the outer parts as @xmath42 ( see also andredakis et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the values for the @xmath10 and @xmath5 bands",
    "were then averaged to obtain a single value of @xmath20 and @xmath42 for each galaxy .",
    "the accuracy of these estimates is difficult to assess : bright bulges can affect the isophotes even at large radii , leading to an underestimate of @xmath42 , while bars and spiral arms may often lead to overestimates .",
    "in turn , @xmath20 can be easily underestimated because of the seeing . from simulations",
    ", it seems that a reasonable estimate for the uncertainty in @xmath42 is about 0.1 ; it is certainly worse in @xmath20 , 0.2 or more in the worst cases .",
    "we note that comparing the observed image to the extracted bulge@xmath6disk distribution , for example in terms of residuals , is of little use to test the ellipticities , since it is often possible to find excellent agreement for a wide range of @xmath20 and @xmath42 .",
    "a more stringent constraint is provided by the _ color _ profiles of bulge and disk , which turn out to be quite sensitive to the values of @xmath20 and @xmath42 .",
    "this has ultimately allowed us to verify the ellipticities a posteriori ( in particular @xmath20 ) by letting them vary within the estimated errors and checking the plausibility of the resulting color profiles .",
    "the final accuracy is estimated to be better than 0.05 .",
    "[ figure : all ] clearly shows , the elliptically - averaged profiles reproduce quite well the major - axis cut in almost all cases .",
    "in fact , our sample contains only moderately inclined systems ( @xmath61 ) , whose isophotes are reasonably elliptical .",
    "however , a comparison between the 1-d and 2-d results from table  [ table : parameters ] shows that the 1-d decomposition is always less accurate , and sometimes inconsistent with the 2-d one .",
    "the inferior quality of the 1-d fits is attested to both by the larger errors on the parameters and by the larger values of @xmath34 .",
    "a comparison between 1-d and 2-d results for the galaxies with significant non - axisymmetric structure suggests that 2-d fits manage to reproduce the whole distribution , whereas 1-d decompositions tend to match closely only the inner part of the profile , i.e. the less noisy one ( see also byun & freeman @xcite ) .",
    "because of their superiority , when discussing parametric models , we will consider only the results of 2-d decompositions .",
    "no systematic differences are found between the various fitted parameters : the 1-d bulge and disk scale lengths are , to within the scatter , the same as those of the 2-d fits , and the fitted inclination of the 2-d model corresponds , on average , to the fixed value determined from the outer isophotes ( and used in the 1-d fits ) .",
    "however , disks are definitely better constrained than bulges : the rms difference of the 1- and 2-d @xmath30 s ( 0.6  @xmath5-mag ) is half that for @xmath29 ( 1.1  @xmath5-mag ) , and the dispersion in the ratio of 1- and 2-d @xmath19 s is 80% , while that for the @xmath31 s is four times lower ( 21% ) , comparable to the discrepancies among disk scale lengths from different authors found by knapen & van der kruit ( @xcite ) .    we have compared the results of our non - parametric ( np ) decompositions with the 2-d parametric ones , and with those of kent ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is no systematic difference between our 2-d and np bulge and disk luminosities , as the mean difference is @xmath62  mag for @xmath63 , and @xmath64 for the disk .",
    "again , disk parameters are more consistent than those of the bulge .",
    "parametric ellipticities are not significantly different from np ones : the mean ratio of the np @xmath20 s and those fitted by the 2-d parametric method is 1.1  @xmath65  0.5 .",
    "system inclinations agree very well , with a mean ratio of @xmath66 .",
    "also , the bulge ellipticities determined by kent ( @xcite ) are about the same as those used in our np decomposition , but with large scatter ; the inclinations are in good agreement , with a mean ratio of @xmath67 .      in order to compare our results with those of other authors",
    ", we have investigated trends with @xmath0 of the bulge and disk fitted parameters .",
    "figure [ figure : n ] shows the systematic variation in these , for a given galaxy , as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that the derived bulge parameters strongly depend on the form of the fitting function .",
    "the same bulge , when fitted with small @xmath0 , appears to be `` denser '' ( that is to say brighter @xmath29 ) , more compact ( smaller @xmath19 ) , and less luminous than when fitted with large @xmath0 .",
    "quantitatively , the changes are dramatic as @xmath0 goes from 1 to 4 with a mean change in @xmath29 of 3  mag  arcsec@xmath2 , and in scale length of roughly a factor of 3 .",
    "moreover , the dispersion in the fitted values also increases with @xmath0 ; the spread of @xmath68 at @xmath0  =  4 is 1.5 times larger than that at @xmath0  =  1 , and the spread of @xmath29 is more than twice as large",
    ".    the derived disk parameters also change with the @xmath0 of the bulge .",
    "@xmath30 tends to be fainter for bulge @xmath0 larger , and , as for the bulge , the dispersion in @xmath30 increases with @xmath0 .",
    "the only parameter that is stable with @xmath0 is the disk scale length @xmath31 , although its dispersion does increase slightly with @xmath0 .",
    "we conclude that , at least statistically , bulge structural parameters are strongly influenced by the form of the function used to derive them . not only are the parameters themselves altered by constraining the form of the bulge , but also the dispersion in the parameters is changed .",
    "independently of the best - fit @xmath0 , requiring a de vaucouleurs law to fit the bulge yields more tenuous , extended , and luminous spheroids , together with wider distributions of the parameters ( larger dispersion ) , than does using a simple exponential .      in terms of the `` quality indicators '' mentioned in sect .",
    "[ pd ] , @xmath0  =  3 gave superior results for the majority of galaxies , while @xmath0  =  2 was the second - best choice .",
    "in only two cases did @xmath0  =  4 give the highest quality fit , and in one case ( ngc  3593 ) @xmath0  =  1 .",
    "these values are in general agreement with the trend noted by andredakis et al .",
    "( @xcite ) who fitted the @xmath0 of non - parametric bulge profiles and found that early - type spirals tend to have bulges with @xmath69 .",
    "we also note that , in our experience , it is usually difficult to determine the best @xmath0 with a precision much better than 1 .",

    "[ figure : n ] , higher @xmath0 s produce slightly more luminous bulges .",
