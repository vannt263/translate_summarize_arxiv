    "perturbative - qcd - based models developed in the last few years predict that nucleus - nucleus collisions at future collider energies are dominated by hard or semihard processes @xcite .",
    "these processes happen during the very early stage of the collisions and they produce a rather large number of semihard partons which essentially form a hot and undersaturated parton gas @xcite . however , this parton gas is initially far away from thermal and chemical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "secondary parton scatterings in the gas may eventually lead to local thermal and chemical equilibrium if the parton interactions are sufficiently strong .",
    "transport calculations based on a semiclassical parton cascade model  @xcite indicate that thermal equilibrium could be established within a rather short time of about 1 fm/@xmath2 .",
    "however , the complexity of the monte carlo simulations makes it difficult to obtain a lucid understanding of the dependence of the thermalization time on the many parameters employed in the model .",
    "one such parameter is the cut - off of momentum transfer in binary parton scatterings .",
    "the cut - off was first introduced to regularize the infrared divergency of the cross section between two massless partons in high - energy @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions @xcite .",
    "the value of the momentum cut - off is determined phenomenologically to reproduce the measured total cross sections of @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions . however",
    ", this cut - off is not necessary anymore in a high - temperature quark - gluon plasma , since the debye screening and landau damping provide natural regularizations of the infrared divergency .",
    "since transport times depend sensitively on the screening masses which in turn depend on the temperature , the introduction of an artificial cut - off could give rise to a completely different behavior of the thermalization time and consequently the approach to thermal equilibrium .",
    "the approach to thermal equilibrium in relativistic heavy ion collisions is dictated by the competition between expansion and parton interactions @xcite . if the expansion is much rapid than the typical collision time among partons , e.g. , shortly after partons are initially produced , the expansion is closer to free - streaming than hydrodynamic expansion . only at times in the order of the collision time",
    "may the parton gas reach local thermal equilibrium and expand hydrodynamically .",
    "furthermore , the time dependence of the collision time ( or the relaxation time ) will determine whether the system can eventually reach local thermal equilibrium because of the competition between expansion and parton interactions .",
    "if the collision time increases rapidly with time , the parton system may never thermalize , leading only to a free - streaming limit . the collision time ,",
    "therefore , is a very important quantity which in turn depends sensitively on the infrared behavior of parton interactions .    in qcd ,",
    "parton scattering cross sections exhibit a quadratic infrared singularity due to the exchange of a massless gluon .",
    "the infrared behavior can be improved by including corrections from hard thermal loops to the gluon propagators .",
    "resummation of these thermal loops gives rise to an effective gluon propagator which screens long range interactions ( debye screening ) .",
    "braaten and pisarski  @xcite have developed this resummation technique systematically and used it to calculate the damping rate of a soft gluon ( @xmath5 ) which is gauge invariant and complete to the leading order in the qcd coupling constant @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "for a fast particle ( @xmath7 ) , the exchanged gluons probe the static limit of the magnetic interactions which by the transversality condition are not screened .",
    "one thus has to introduce a nonperturbative magnetic screening mass to regularize the logarithmic infrared singularity in the static limit @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the damping rate for an energetic particle to the leading order in @xmath6 is @xmath8\\ ; ,     \\label{eq : damp1}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 .",
    "however , as we will argue , damping rates do not determine how fast a system approach local thermal equilibrium .",
    "what really determine the thermalization processes are the transport rates which are free of the logarithmic divergency after the resummation of thermal loops @xcite .",
    "this is because thermalization is achieved to the leading order mainly through momentum changes in elastic scatterings .",
    "thus , the effective cross section should be weighted by the momentum transfer and the dynamic screening due to the landau damping of the gluons is sufficient to regularize the logarithmic singularity in the transverse interactions @xcite .",
    "the resultant transport times for a system near thermal equilibrium behave like @xmath10 to the leading order in @xmath11 .    for a system near local thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the time dependence of the transport times is through the temperature according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : trans1 ] ) .",
    "this dependence is in general slower than @xmath12 and thus can lead to local thermal equilibrium according to our earlier argument based on the relaxation time approximation @xcite .",
    "however , if one introduces an artificial cut - off for the momentum transfers of elastic parton scatterings as in the numerical simulation of a classical parton cascade  @xcite , the time dependence will be much stronger .",
    "consequently , as we will demonstrate in this paper , the system will approach local thermal equilibrium much slowly .",
    "we will also demonstrate that inclusion of the screening effects is the key to a slower time dependence of the relaxation time , therefore a faster approach to thermal equilibrium .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we first re - examine the boltzmann equation and the evaluation of the damping rate and the relaxation time to the lowest order , including only @xmath13 processes .",
    "we will also discuss the time dependence of the relaxation time in different scenarios . in section iii , we will solve the boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation and demonstrate how time dependence of the relaxation time will affect the approach to thermal equilibrium .",
    "we also show how initial conditions of a system affect the thermalization processes and the final total entropy production ( or `` memory effect '' ) in section iv . finally in section",
    "v we give a summary and an outlook , especially of the numerical simulations of parton thermalization , taking into account of the debye screening and landau damping effects without double counting .",
    "in a system with two - components as , e.g. , the quark and gluon plasma , the one that interacts the strongest will thermalize faster than the other . subsequently there will be momentum and energy transfer between them .",
    "since numerical simulations indicate that the initially produced partons are mostly gluon , we consider here a gluon gas only for simplicity .",
    "the debye screening of color fields in the presence of semihard gluons @xcite will also allow us to neglect the effect of mean fields .",
    "we furthermore assume that the spatial variation of the system is small on the scale of a collision length so that we can approximate the evolution of the system by the boltzmann equation @xcite , @xmath14\\frac{1}{2}|m_{12\\to 34}|^2 ( 2\\pi)^4\\delta^4(p_1+p_2-p_3-p_4 ) ,     \\label{eq : boltz1 }",

    "inclusion of the full expression of the self - energy only contribute to the next order corrections .",
    "the increase in scattering by including quarks is exactly compensated by the increase in debye screening due to quarks @xcite .    for a soft gluon ( @xmath5 )",
    ", one can not neglect its thermal mass anymore . the damping rate for a gluon at rest will not have the logarithmic divergency in the transverse interaction , since the exchanged gluon must carry nonzero momentum and energy at least of order of @xmath74 and thus never approach to the static limit .",
    "in addition the transverse ( magnetic ) interactions are reduced by velocity factors which for the massive partons are smaller than the speed of light .",
    "the damping rate in this case was found by braaten and pisarski @xcite to the leading order as @xmath75 apparently , the damping rate has a nontrivial momentum dependence @xcite .",
    "as we have mentioned , @xmath76 is a solution to the boltzmann equation as far as the flow velocity is uniform in space and time .",
    "we should emphasize here that the damping rate _ does not _ determine how rapidly a system near equilibrium approaches it as one would naively think .",
    "the thermalization time is actually related to the transport rates @xcite . the easiest way to prove",
    "this is to check that the logarithmic divergency that has plagued the calculation of the damping rate of a fast gluon does not appear in the boltzmann equation . to check this",
    ", we make the following expansion : @xmath77 for small angle scatterings .",
    "the function @xmath78 $ ] in boltzmann equation becomes @xmath79=-\\frac{q^2x^2}{2}\\left[f_1(1\\pm f_1)f''_2    + f_2(1\\pm f_2)f''_1 -2(1\\pm f_1 \\pm f_2)f'_1f'_2\\right ] \\ ; , \\ ] ] which is proportional to @xmath80 .",
    "here we have dropped terms linear in @xmath73 since they vanish after integration over @xmath73 .",
    "one can verify that this function after expansion still vanishes for the equilibrium distribution , @xmath81=0 $ ] . for a system away from equilibrium , the collisional integral in the boltzmann equation is nonzero but finite despite the logarithmic singularity in the transverse part of the matrix element squared , @xmath82 when @xmath83 . because of the factor @xmath80 in @xmath78 $ ] , landau damping in the self - energy of the exchanged gluon is sufficient to give a finite value of the collisional integral .",
    "in other words , thermalization not only depends on the parton interaction rates but also on the efficiency of transferring momentum in each interaction .",
    "those interactions with zero energy and momentum transfers do not contribute to the thermalization process , though their cross sections are infinitely large .",
    "this is why the thermalization time and other transport coefficients do not suffer from the infrared divergency as pointed out in a number of papers @xcite .    for a system near equilibrium",
    ", one can characterize the deviation from equilibrium by @xmath84 in a relaxation time approximation .",
    "equivalently , one has @xmath85 in general the relaxation time @xmath86 depends on momentum @xmath87 and in principle can be obtained by solving the linearized boltzmann equation . in this paper",
    ", we neglect the momentum dependence of the relaxation time . for a pure gluonic gas near local thermal equilibrium where thermalization is achieved through viscous relaxation ,",
    "the relaxation time is ( appendix b ) @xmath88 again , because of the extra factor @xmath80 appearing in the transport rate , the debye screening and landau damping are sufficient to regularize the effective transport cross section .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from interactions with @xmath89 , leading to a logarithmic factor @xmath90 as compared to @xmath91 in the gluon damping rate .",
    "therefore , the dependence of the relaxation time on the ( weak ) coupling constant and the color dimension @xmath92 is quite different from the gluon damping rate .",
    "if the system is close to thermal equilibrium , the hydrodynamic equations from energy - momentum conservation to the zeroth order of @xmath93 can give us the time evolution of the temperature @xmath94 .",
    "for an ideal gluon gas with one - dimensional expansion , @xmath94 decreases like @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , the relaxation time @xmath96 increases with time with a power of @xmath97 , @xmath98 a more general time dependence of the relaxation time can have a power - law form , @xmath99 which also covers both the constant ( @xmath100 ) and the linear ( @xmath101 ) cases as have been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "the latter case arises when a constant scattering cross section , @xmath102 , is assumed for the relaxation time , @xmath103 , and with a density decreasing as @xmath104 due to one - dimensional expansion . for a system far away from thermal equilibrium , the time dependence may differ from eq .",
    "( [ eq : relax1 ] ) .",
    "our earlier calculations @xcite show that an initially free - streaming system has only a logarithmic time dependence .",
    "this is because the phase space for small angle scatterings ( @xmath105 ) opens up quadratically with time in the free - streaming case and it balances the decrease in parton density .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the weak time dependence of the relaxation time in eq .",
    "( [ eq : relax1 ] ) depends very sensitively on the debye screening of the small - angle parton scatterings which restricts the momentum transfer to @xmath106 .",
    "smaller debye screening mass due to the decrease of the temperature , gives a larger interaction rate which then compensates the decrease of the parton density and thus gives the weak time dependence of the relaxation time .",
    "if we use a fixed momentum cut - off @xmath107 , as in most of the numerical simulations of parton production @xcite and cascade @xcite , instead of a time dependent debye screening mass , the effective transport cross section will remain constant , proportional to @xmath108 .",
    "the resultant relaxation time @xmath109 will increase more rapidly with time .",
    "if we have to include transverse expansion later in the evolution of a system , then the temperature will decrease faster , like @xmath110 , than in the one - dimensional case assuming hydrodynamic expansion .",
    "the relaxation time even with the inclusion of debye screening will increase linearly with time .",
    "the relaxation time with a momentum cut - off applied to parton interactions will increase faster than linear with time , which will only lead the system into free - streaming .    at this point we should emphasize that we have only considered the lowest order contribution from @xmath13 processes in our calculation of the relaxation time . in principle , higher order processes , like @xmath111",
    ", should also contribute to the thermalization .",
    "such processes can be included by considering high order thermal vertex corrections .",
    "for a complete calculation , one should also include vacuum corrections and the result should depend on the renormalization scale and obey the renormalization group equation .",

    ", @xmath113 is some confinement scale below which perturbative qcd is no longer applicable . at finite temperature , @xmath113 is very likely to be replaced by screening masses .",

    "the strong coupling constant is not very small .",
    "the above contributions might not be negligible .",
    "however , for an order - of - magnitude estimate , we can neglect these higher order contributions . if one considers the chemical equilibration of a kinetically thermalized system as in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath118 multiplication processes become very important .",
    "the leading contribution to the chemical equilibration , in this case , comes from @xmath119 processes .",
    "let us consider the early stage of a very heavy ion collision where transverse expansion is not important yet .",
    "we then can treat the system as a one - dimensional system .",
    "we assume along with bjorken @xcite a scaling flow velocity @xmath120 in the longitudinal direction , where @xmath121 are the proper time and spatial rapidity , respectively . in terms of these new variables ,",
    "the boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation for a system near thermal equilibrium becomes @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 is the rapidity of a particle , @xmath125 since @xmath126 , we can see that the solution to the above boltzmann equation is a function of @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , and is lorentz invariant under longitudinal boost .",

    "one can expect that the initial evolution of the system near @xmath203 should be determined by the value of @xmath204 , @xmath205    using the initial distribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : init1 ] ) , we have @xmath206 an isotropic situation corresponds to @xmath207 or @xmath208 which is very close to the value we obtained by requiring @xmath209 . for @xmath210 , @xmath211 , the system starts its evolution more like free streaming as we have noticed in our numerical solutions .",
    "the extreme case is the bjorken scaling ansatz , @xmath160 , @xmath212 , which corresponds exactly to free streaming . for @xmath213 , @xmath214 , the system will initially expand in the longitudinal direction even faster than a thermal expansion , as also demonstrated in our numerical solutions .",
    "physically , this is caused by the higher longitudinal pressure built up by the large amount of partons which are distributed over a large range of rapidity in the local frame .",
    "one can check that the expansion in this early stage is still dominated by free - streaming .",
    "however , working against such high pressure costs energy thus leading to less entropy production as we now show in the following .",
    "since the system will eventually approach the thermal equilibrium limit when @xmath1 , we can define a prefactor @xmath215 by @xmath216 this prefactor in general can only be calculated numerically and will depend on the relaxation time as well as the initial condition as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . using the above expression",
    ", one can calculate the final entropy of the system per comoving volume @xcite @xmath217 which is exactly proportional to @xmath215 .",
    "here @xmath218 is only a parameter in the time dependence of the final temperature , @xmath219 .",
    "since the initial system is not in equilibrium especially for large values of @xmath143 , @xmath220 should not be considered as the initial entropy density .",
    "therefore , @xmath215 is not the absolute increase of the total entropy over its initial value , except when the initial distribution is an equilibrium one .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath215 still carries a lot of information about the thermalization process of the system .",
    "we plot this prefactor in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] as a function of @xmath143 for @xmath191 but for different values of @xmath186 .",
    "it is clear that there is less entropy production for larger values of @xmath143 , since the system has to work against increasingly high longitudinal pressure thus converting its kinetic energy to expansion energy .",
    "the system has the maximum entropy production when the initial distribution is that of the bjorken scaling ansatz , @xmath160 . in this case",
    ", one can calculate @xcite that the entropy production increases with the relaxation time like @xmath221 .",
    "for very large values of @xmath143 , @xmath222 decreases slightly with @xmath186 as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , since the system has to spend longer time work against the extraordinaryly high longitudinal pressure .",
    "it is the competition between long thermalization time ( thus entropy production ) and long duration of work against high pressure that reverses the @xmath186 dependence of entropy production @xmath215 .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the thermalization process in a one - dimensional expanding parton plasma within the framework of the boltzmann equation .",
    "in particular , we have studied the time dependence of the relaxation time and its influence on the thermalization . if the time dependence is weaker than a linear form , we find that the thermal equilibrium limit will eventually be reached . for a time dependence stronger than the linear one ,",
    "the system will never thermalize , only leading to a free - stream limit . for an exact linear time dependence",
    ", the system will reach an asymptotic state between free - streaming and thermal equilibrium .",
    "we find that the thermalization process also depends on the initial condition of the system .",
    "the deviation of the initial momentum distribution from an isotropic one in the longitudinal direction determines the initial approach to thermal equilibrium .",
    "this initial approach will then carry its inertia throughout the whole thermalization process .",
    "this `` memory effect '' can be seen from the dependence of the final total entropy production on the initial momentum distributions .",
    "using perturbative qcd at finite temperature in the transport theory , we have calculated the relaxation time as a result of parton scatterings .",
    "we have pointed out the important differences between parton damping rates and thermalization times . to regularize the singular behavior of the parton scattering cross sections , we have used a full gluon propagator which includes the resummation of an infinite number of hot thermal loops . because of the singular behavior of the parton scattering matrix elements , the resultant relaxation time depends sensitively on the debye screening mass @xmath223 . in an expanding parton gas ,",
    "the temperature decreases with time and so does the debye screening mass , thus leading to an increasing transport cross section .",
    "this then compensates the decrease of the parton density and gives us a relaxation time with a weak time dependence , @xmath224 .",
    "however , if one introduces a fixed momentum cut - off to parton scatterings as in most of numerical simulations , one will introduce an extra logarithmic time dependence which will slow down the thermalization process .",
    "although we have demonstrated the necessity of the inclusion of debye screening and landau damping in the study of the parton thermalization in an expanding system , it is not clear to us how to incorporate them into numerical simulations such as parton cascade models .",
    "one can include the debye screening semiclassically @xcite by brutal force .",
    "however , one immediate problem we have to solve is how to avoid double counting .    since we used the full propagator which includes many thermal loops , we have effectively included multiple particle scatterings .",
    "one can easily see this by expanding the full propagator in terms of the bare propagators at zero temperature and the self - energy from thermal loops .",
    "the contribution from the real part of the self - energy ( mainly debye screening ) corresponds to multiple particle scatterings in the thermal bath .",
    "one can in principle include particle radiation and absorption by considering the thermal loop corrections to the full vertices . in doing so",
    ", one can automatically avoid both the infrared and collinear divergencies @xcite which one normally regularizes by resorting to two additional cut - offs @xcite .",
    "as we have demonstrated in appendix b , the imaginary part of the self - energy also contributes to the effective parton scattering in a parton gas .",
    "in fact , the imaginary part , which is responsible for landau damping , is necessary to regularize the transverse interaction since there is no magnetic screening in qcd . the contribution from this imaginary part to",
    "an effective two - parton scattering corresponds to independent scatterings of the two partons off particles in the thermal bath .",
    "this can easily cause double counting in a parton cascade model because independent parton scatterings are also simulated over the volume of the system",
    ". one might be able to avoid this problem by introducing a length scale in the order of @xmath225 , within which multiple particle scatterings are not allowed and only _ one _ effective two - parton scattering ( with debye screening and landau damping ) is permitted .",
