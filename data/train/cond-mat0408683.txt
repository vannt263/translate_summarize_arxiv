    "the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction between valence electrons in metals is known to yield collective behaviour , manifesting itself in the form of plasma oscillations .",
    "pines and bohm@xcite were the first to suggest that the discrete energy losses experienced by fast electrons in passing through metals are due to the excitation of these plasma oscillations , the basic unit of energy being termed the plasmon:@xcite @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the valence electron density and @xmath2 is the free electron mass.@xcite    gabor@xcite investigated the excitation of plasma oscillations in thin foils , but assumed that the electric field is always zero at the surface . as a result , he did not find surface modes in the bounded plasma and reached the erroneus conclusion that the probability for plasma loss should decrease strongly with decreasing foil thickness .",
    "ritchie@xcite was the first to find that the effect of the film boundaries is to cause the appearence of a new `` lowered '' loss at @xmath3 due to the excitation of surface collective oscillations , the quanta of which stern and ferrell called the surface plasmon.@xcite    ritchie s prediction of surface polarization causing low - energy losses in metals was confirmed in a series of experiments carried out by powell and swan@xcite , who observed inelastic losses experienced by electrons scattered from newly evaporated layers of al and mg . since then , there has been a significant advance in both theoretical and experimental investigations of collective modes in the vacuum - solid interface .",
    "the concept of the surface plasmon has played a key role in the understanding of fundamental properties of solids and in the interpretation of a large variety of experiments .",
    "for example , the classical image potential acting between a point classical charge and a metal surface was shown to be originated in the shifted zero point energy of the surface plasmon field,@xcite the impact of the surfce plasmon on surface energies was addressed,@xcite the energy loss of charged particles moving outside a metal surface was shown to be due to the excitation of surface plasmons,@xcite and the centroid of the electron density induced by external potentials acting on a metal surface was demonstrated to be dictated by the wave - vector dependence of surface plasmons.@xcite explicit expressions for the surface - plasmon dispersion relied originally on simple models , such as the hydrodynamic,@xcite specular - reflection,@xcite and infinite - barrier@xcite models .",
    "accurate numerical calculations have also been performed from the knowledge of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the kohn - sham hamiltonian of density - functional theory ( dft),@xcite showing nice agreement with the experiments that have been carried out on clean , well characterized surfaces of the alkali metals.@xcite these experiments also showed evidence for the existence of the so - called multipole surface plasmons that had been predicted by benett.@xcite    the long - wavelength@xcite surface - plasmon energy @xmath4 was derived by ritchie in the nonrelativistic approximation , by assuming that the coulomb interaction is instantaneous .",
    "however , if one is to describe the interaction of either relativistic electrons or light with solid surfaces , it is necessary to take into account the time needed for the propagation of the true retarded interaction . as a result of retardation , surface plasmons couple at wavelengths larger than @xmath5 with the free electromagnetic field and",
    "yield what is now called a surface - plasmon polariton.@xcite at these large wavelengths , the surface - plasmon polariton exists over the entire frequency range from zero to an asymptotic value determined by the surface - plasmon frequency @xmath6 .",
    "however , the corresponding dispersion curve never crosses the dispersion curve of free - space electromagnetic radiation .",
    "hence , there is always a momentum mismatch between light and surface plasmons of the same frequency , so that light incident on an ideal surface can not excite surface plasmons and , conversely , the surface plasmon can not decay by emitting a photon .",
    "teng and stern@xcite were the first to point out that any surface roughness permits the surface to impart some additional momentum to the surface - plasma oscillation , so that it can couple to electromagnetic radiation .",
    "alternatively , prism coupling can be used to enhance the momentum of incident light , as demonstrated by otto@xcite and by kretchmann and raether.@xcite hence , surface plasmons have been employed in a wide spectrum of studies from electrochemistry , catalysis , wetting , thin organic condensates , and biosensing,@xcite to scanning tunneling microscopy,@xcite the ejection of ions from surfaces,@xcite surface dynamics,@xcite surface - plasmon microscopy,@xcite and surface - plasmon resonance technology.@xcite moreover , recent advances that allow metals to be structured and characterized on the nanometer scale have rekindled the long - standing interest in surface plasmons , one of the most attractive aspects of these collective excitations now being their use to concentrate light in subwavelength structures@xcite and to enhance transmission through periodic arrays of subwavelengths holes in optically thick metallic films,@xcite as well as the possible fabrication of nanoscale photonic circuits operating at optical frequencies.@xcite    since the typical energy of bulk and surface plasmons is of a few electronvolts , thermal excitation of these collective oscillations is improbable , so that the electronic properties near the fermi level can not be directly influenced by these excitations .",
    "much more effective than ordinary bulk and surface plasmons in mediating , e.g. , superconductivity would be the so - called acoustic plasmons with sound - like long - wavelength dispersion,@xcite which have spurred over the years a remarkable interest and research activity.@xcite acoustic plasma oscillations were observed in two - dimensionally confined and spatially separated multicomponent structures such as quantum wells and heterojunctions,@xcite and were then proposed as possible candidates to mediate the attractive interaction leading to the formation of cooper pairs in high-@xmath7 superconductors.@xcite    recently , it has been shown that metal surfaces where a partially occupied quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) surface - state band coexists in the same region of space with the underlying three - dimensional ( 3d ) continuum support a well - defined acoustic surface plasmon.@xcite this _ new _ low - energy collective excitation exhibits linear dispersion at low wave vectors , and might therefore affect electron - hole ( e - h ) and phonon dynamics near the fermi level.@xcite it has been demonstrated that it is a combination of the nonlocality of the 3d dynamical screening and the spill out of the 3d electron density into the vacuum which allows the formation of 2d electron - density acoustic oscillations at metal surfaces , since these oscillations would otherwise be completely screened by the surrounding 3d substrate.@xcite    in this paper , we first present an overview with the basic concepts underlying the existence of surface collective excitations in metallic structures , and we then introduce the new concept of acoustic surface plasmons .",
    "we begin in section ii with a brief discussion of the role that surface - plasmon excitation plays in the interaction of fast charged particles with solid surfaces , since it is precisely the investigation of electron energy loss in thin foils which brought ritchie to the realization that surface collective excitations exist at the lowered frequency @xmath6.@xcite the detection of surface plasmons and their dispersion is discussed in section iii , in the framework of angle - resolved inelastic electron scattering experiments .",

    "the acoustic surface plasmon dispersion curve is well below the dispersion curve of free - space electromagnetic radiation .",
    "hence , there is , in principle , no way that incident light can provide an ideal surface with the correct amount of momentum and energy for the excitation of an acoustic surface plasmon . as in the case of conventional surface plasmons",
    ", however , a periodic corrugation or grating in the metal surface should be able to provide the missing momentum .    if light hits a surface with a periodic corrugation , the grating ( see bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] ) can provide the impigning free electromagnetic waves with additional momentum arising from the grating periodic structure .",
    "if free electromagnetic radiation hits the grating at an angle @xmath132 , its wave vector along the grating surface has magnitude @xmath133 where @xmath134 represents the grating constant , and @xmath135 .",
    "hence , the linear ( nearly vertical ) dispersion relation of free light changes into a set of parallel straight lines , which can match the acoustic - plasmon dispersion relation .    for a well - defined acoustic surface plasmon in be(0001 ) to be observed , the wave number @xmath63 needs to be smaller than @xmath125 . for @xmath111 , eq .",
