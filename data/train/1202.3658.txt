    "the physics of @xmath0 spinor bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) started to gain the attention of both theorists and experimentalists during the last decade .",
    "the interest was motivated by the structure of @xmath0 condensates : being more complex than that of @xmath1 condensates , it made possible properties and phenomena which are not present in an @xmath1 system .",
    "one example of this can been seen in the structure of the ground states .",
    "the energy functional of an @xmath0 condensate is characterized by one additional degree of freedom compared to the @xmath1 case .",
    "this leads to a rich ground state manifold as now there are two free parameters parametrizing the ground states @xcite .",
    "this should be contrasted with an @xmath1 condensate , where the ground state is determined by the sign of the spin - dependent interaction term @xcite .",
    "another difference can be seen in the structure of topological defects .",
    "it has been shown that non - commuting vortices can exist in an @xmath0 condensate @xcite , while these are not possible in an @xmath1 bec @xcite .",
    "the topological defects of @xmath0 condensates have been studied further by the authors of refs .",
    "experimental studies of @xmath0 becs have been advancing in the past ten years .",
    "experiments on @xmath0 @xmath2rb atoms cover topics such as spin dynamics @xcite , creation of skyrmions @xcite , spin - dependent inelastic collisions @xcite , amplification of fluctuations @xcite , spontaneous breaking of spatial and spin symmetry @xcite , and atomic homodyne detection @xcite .",
    "an @xmath0 spinor condensate of @xmath3na atoms has been obtained experimentally @xcite , but it has a much shorter lifetime than @xmath0 rubidium condensates .    in this work ,",

    "the stability of stationary states has been examined both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",

    "we show that , in comparison with an @xmath1 system , the stability analysis of an @xmath0 condensate is considerably more complicated .",
    "this is partly due to the presence of a spin - singlet term in the energy functional of the latter system , but the main reason for the increased complexity is seen to be the much larger number of states available in an @xmath0 condensate .",
