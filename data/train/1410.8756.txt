    "a _ mixed searching game _ is defined in terms of a graph representing a system of tunnels where an agile and omniscient fugitive with unbounded speed is hidden ( alternatively , we can formulate the same problem considering that the tunnels are contaminated by some poisonous gas ) . the fugitive is occupying the edges of the graph and the searchers can be placed on its vertices . in the beginning of the game ,",
    "the fugitive chooses some edge and there are no searchers at all on the graph .",
    "the objective of the searchers is to deploy a search strategy on the graph that can guarantee the capture of the fugitive .",
    "the fugitive is _ captured _ if at some point he resides on an edge @xmath2 and one of the following capturing cases occurs .    * _ both endpoints of @xmath2 are occupied by a searcher , _ * _ a searcher slides along @xmath2 _ , i.e. , a searcher is moved from one endpoint of the edge to the other endpoint .",
    "a _ search strategy _ on a graph @xmath3 is a finite sequence @xmath4 containing moves of the following types .",
    "* -0.5cmp@xmath5 : placing a new searcher on a vertex @xmath6 , * -0.5cmr@xmath5 : deleting a searcher from a vertex @xmath6 , * -0.5cms@xmath7 : sliding a searcher on @xmath6 along the edge @xmath8 and placing it on @xmath9 .",
    "we stress that the fugitive is _ agile _ and _ omniscient _ , i.e. he moves at any time in the most favourable , for him , position and is _ invisible _ , i.e. the searchers strategy is given `` in advance '' and does not depend on the moves of the fugitive during it .    given a search @xmath4 , we denote by @xmath10 the set of edges that are clean after applying the first @xmath11 steps of @xmath4 , where by `` clean '' we mean that the search strategy can guarantee that none of its edges will be occupied by the fugitive after the @xmath11-th step .",
    "more formally , we set @xmath12 and in step @xmath13 we define @xmath10 as the set defined as follows : first consider the set @xmath14 containing all the edges in @xmath15 plus the edges of @xmath16 the set of edges that are cleaned after the @xmath11-th move because of the application of cases @xmath17 or @xmath18 . notice that @xmath16 may be empty .",
    "in particular , it may be non - empty in case the @xmath11-move is a placement move , will always be empty in case the @xmath11-th move is a removal move and will surely be non - empty in case the @xmath11-th move is a sliding move . in the third case ,",
    "the edge along which the sliding occurs is called _ the sliding edge _ of @xmath16 .",
    "then , the set @xmath10 is defined as the set of all edges in @xmath14 minus those for which there is a path starting from them and finishing in an edge not in @xmath14 .",
    "this expresses the fact that the agile and omniscient fugitive could use any of these paths in order to occupy again some of the edges in @xmath14 . in case @xmath19",
