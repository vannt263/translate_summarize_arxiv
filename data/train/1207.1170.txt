    "oscillations appear all over the sun and are the second major component of the photospheric velocity field .",
    "5-min oscillations have been very closely studied in recent years particularly to probe the physical properties of the solar interior .    solar pressure waves ( and oscillations ) are believed to be excited by turbulent convection around 200 km below the surface ( goode _ et al . _ , 1992 ) , where velocities take maximum values .",
    "recent numerical simulations of acoustic wave propagation and dispersion ( shelyag _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) suggest a possible location of the flux source 2000 km below the solar surface .",
    "the mechanism of excitation of oscillations is generally understood from a theoretical perspective .",
    "observational verifications and investigations need to be done .",
    "the question arises whether such excitation occurs all over the surface or whether localized sources of enhanced generation exist .",
    "wave amplitude and phase diagnosis have been applied to detect acoustic events ( aes ) as sources of enhanced acoustic wave generation at high spatial resolution ( brown , 1991 ) .",
    "aes ( defined as sub - arcsec spatially concentrated and short duration energy flux ) have been first detected on high - resolution spectra from ground based observations ( rimmele _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ; strous _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) and are now well studied by 2d spectrometers using line scans ( bello gonzlez _",
    "et al . _ , 2009 , 2010a , 2010b ) .",
    "aes ( or seismic events ) are visible in the photosphere but could be the counterpart of the localized events which excite solar oscillations beneath the photosphere , transferring mechanical energy into oscillations .",
    "the strongest events appear to be located in the intergranular lanes , where downflows are often detected .",
    "they may be excited by some cooling mechanism ( rimmele _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) .",
    "et al_. ( 2000 ) suggest that aes could generate an appreciable part of the energy necessary to sustain the whole @xmath10-mode spectrum .",
    "more recently , bello gonzlez _",
    "( 2010b ) , using the sunrise experiment , found that the energy of acoustic waves above 5 mhz could compensate partly energy losses of the chromosphere and originates mainly from small and localized regions .",
    "convective motions produce temporally varying stress and entropy fluctuations which can act as sources of acoustic waves .",
    "theoretical work shows that downflowing plumes ( cooling events ; see rast , 1999 ) can locally excite acoustic oscillations .",
    "3d numerical simulations ( skartlien _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) suggest that compressed granules at mesogranular boundaries could generate upward - propagating waves .",
    "@xmath10-mode excitation is suspected to occur preferentially close to the top of the convection zone in the superadiabatic layer , where turbulent velocities and entropy fluctuations are the largest ( stein _ et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ) .",
    "acoustic wave dissipation is also assumed to be an important heating source for at least the lower chromosphere . in a recent study , rutten _ et al . _",
    "( 2008 ) observed that acoustic grains ( ca ii h2v and k2v lines ) in the chromosphere could be caused by aes .",
    "their photospheric diagnosis suggested that the ca ii grains could be the signature of acoustic excitation by downdrafts .",
    "they also showed that exploding granules could explain oscillation amplitude enhancements , which could modulate the h@xmath11 line core intensity above .    in this paper , we present high spatial resolution doppler measurements at several altitudes in the photosphere in order to detect aes .",
    "we take benefit of observations carried out on 4 september 2009 , with complete absence of atmospheric effects and outstanding spatial resolution in a large 2d field of view ( fov ) .",
    "this provides a better statistics than before at unprecedent spatial resolution .",
    "we investigate the location of aes , their temporal behaviour , dynamical and energetic properties in the range 3 - 10 mhz and the relationships to the granular or intergranular pattern .",
    "we used multi - wavelength data sets of the solar optical telescope ( sot ) onboard _ hinode _ ( _ e.g. _ ichimoto _ et al . _ , 2005 ; suematsu _ et al . _ ,",
    "the sot has a 0.50 m primary mirror aperture with a spatial resolution of about 0.28@xmath1 at 550 nm .",
    "observations were performed at disk center , so that vertical velocities produce dopplershifts , whereas horizontal velocities can be derived from the proper motions of granules .",
    "we used the narrow - band filter imager ( nfi ) to scan profiles of the magnetically insensitive 557.6 nm fe i line with a spatial resolution of 0.28@xmath1 .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the filter is 60 m .",
    "the spectral line was scanned using nine wavelengths along the line profile in the following order , with respect to the line center : -160 , -120 , -80 , -40 , 0 , + 40 , + 80 , + 120 , + 160 m .",
    "the observations were recorded continuously on 4 september 2009 , from 21:07:59 to 22:23:13 ut .",
    "the solar rotation was compensated .",
    "each line scan took 28.75 s for a total observing time of 75 min , so that we have 158 consecutive times of observations corresponding to 9 @xmath12 158 = 1422 images .",
    "the fov was @xmath13 ( @xmath14 pixels ) with a pixel sampling of 0.08@xmath1 .",
    "we first aligned images corresponding to the blue wing of the line at -160 m   apart from line center ( blue continuum ) using cross correlation of 4 quadrants and detected the maximum of the cross correlation functions at a fraction of pixel using 2d paraboloid interpolation .",
    "then we aligned together the 9 consecutive spectral images ( -160 to + 160 m ) covering the line and belonging to the same scan of 28.75 s duration by correlating two successive images spectrally separated by 40 m .",
    "the procedure reduced the fov to @xmath15 ( @xmath16 pixels ) , showing that the tracking of _ hinode _ with solar rotation compensation is excellent .    using a narrow - band filter",
    "has the advantage of a large 2d fov , but the resulting counterpart is that wavelengths scanned along the line profile are not simultaneous . in order to correct this effect , which can induce errors in deriving radial velocities from line profiles",
    ", we applied a phase correction to the temporal fourier transform ( ft ) of the set of data , for each wavelength , with respect to the first wavelength of the line scan ( blue continuum ) .",
    "after computation of the fast fourier transform ( fft ) , a phase correction of the form @xmath17 was applied ( @xmath18 is the temporal frequency , @xmath19 with @xmath20 s is the time lag between the blue continuum and the current wavelength ) , and corrected data were obtained from the inverse fft .    in order to improve image quality , we computed the modulation transfer function ( mtf ) of the telescope taking into account the characteristics of the primary mirror , the central occultation and the three branches of the secondary mirror , together with the geometry of square pixels of the ccd device .",
    "each intensity image of the series was deconvolved with the mtf of the telescope and the ccd array .",
    "we detected small transmission fluctuations in the filter ( a few percent ) at constant wavelength .",
    "this effect was corrected with respect to the mean value of the light curve calculated on the overall fov for each wavelength position .",
    "we computed horizontal velocities from proper motions of granules observed in the continuum ( average between blue and red wings at -160 m   and + 160 m   apart from the line centre ) .",
    "we first had to remove the effects of oscillations before the detection of granular motions ; for that purpose , we applied a subsonic fourier filter in the @xmath21 space , where k and @xmath22 are respectively the wave number and the frequency .",
    "this filter is defined by a region of high frequencies set at zero in the @xmath21 space .",
    "a 3d fft transform was computed in the 2d space + time and only fourier components such that @xmath23 = 6 km s@xmath9 ( where @xmath24 ) were retained ( figure  [ spectrevc ] ) to keep only the convective contribution in the final data ( title _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "we used the local correlation tracking ( lct ) as described by november and simon ( 1988 ) in order to compute horizontal velocities @xmath25 and @xmath26 as a function of space and time , from proper motions of the granulation in the nearby continuum of the line .",
    "horizontal motions were necessary to calculate the horizontal divergence ( @xmath27 ) of the flow , as a function of space and time .",
    "then we computed radial velocities and intensities at different depths in the line profile using the bisector technique .",
    "we defined three bisectors ( chords ) whose widths are 80 m   ( line core ) , 120 m   ( inflexion points ) and 160 m   ( line wings ) .",
    "the line chord of 160 m   was used to sample a layer around an altitude of 80  km ( altrock _ et al . _ , 1975 ; berrilli _ et al . _ , 2002 ) , while chords of 120 m   and 80 m , deeper in the line , were used respectively to study atmospheric levels at about 130  km and 180  km . for each time , a mean line profile was computed over the whole fov , defining a wavelength and intensity reference for the three chords of the bisector .",
    "we applied the same method to individual profiles of the 2d fov and computed for the three chords dopplershifts and intensity fluctuations by reference to the mean profile .",
    "dopplershifts provided the vertical component of the velocity @xmath28 as a function of space and time at three different altitudes ( @xmath29 = 80 , 130 and 180 km , upward / downward velocities respectively positive / negative ) .",
    "from radial velocities at different heights , we derived phases and amplitudes of vertically travelling waves and the acoustic flux as a function of time , spatial position in the fov and altitude in the photosphere .",

    "( 1995 ) and strous _",
    "et al._(2000 ) , the acoustic flux @xmath30 per unit of surface ( w m@xmath2 ) can be approximated by the product of a volumic energy density and the group velocity , assuming that the density @xmath31 is constant :    @xmath30 @xmath32 @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the amplitude and @xmath35 is the group velocity of the wave .",

    "this method is the most accurate for determining the average energy flux ( as it does not require any frequency filtering ) , but on the contrary it does not provide temporal evolution of the flux and the group velocity is not determined from observations .",
    "we used the theoretical value provided by the simple plane parallel model :    @xmath86 ,    so that it is constant and uniform over the fov and there is no energy flux for frequencies below 4.9 mhz .",

    "it also shows that aes mostly occur in intergranular lanes together with downdrafts .",
    "our multilevel velocity data allowed us to analyze the vertical velocity gradient , defined as the difference of radial velocities ( positive upwards ) between altitudes of 180 and 130 km .",

    "the gradient is mostly positive ( which means increasing velocity with height ) in intergranular lanes . in absolute value , it means that the velocity decreases with height above intergranules . on the contrary ,",
    "the gradient is almost zero or slightly negative above granules .",
    "histograms ( not shown ) of the continuum intensity as a function of vertical velocities or velocity gradients computed over the whole fov and over the total duration of the sequence confirmed a strong correlation between dark regions ( intergranules ) and downdrafts , as well as bright regions ( granules ) and upward velocities .",
    "flows are in the range -1 km",

    "the first one , based on the ht , after temporal frequency filtering , allowed us to determine velocity amplitudes and phase lags as a function of time in two layers ( 130 - 180 and 80 - 130 km ) .",
    "the group velocity is proportional to phase lags and was used to derive the signed energy flux . the second method ( avoiding filtering )",
    "was based on fps at three altitudes ( 80 , 130 , and 180 km ) using a constant and uniform group velocity taken from models , but did not provide flux sign nor temporal evolution . both methods delivered complementary results in agreement in the range 5 - 10 mhz .    in the 3 - 10 mhz range ,",
    "the contribution of aes is 2000 w m@xmath2 ( upper layer 130 - 180 km ) and 2700 w m@xmath2 ( lower layer 80 - 130 km ) , with more flux in the 3 - 5 mhz than in the 5 - 10 mhz domain .",
    "aes are spatially concentrated ( 0.3@xmath1 typical , some are probably below the resolving power of the telescope ) .",
    "their average duration is about 600 s at half maximum ( 1200 s including rise and decay phases ) and they carry energy mainly upwards .",
    "each event carries in the range 3 - 10 mhz an average flux of @xmath5 w m@xmath2 ( upper layer ) and @xmath4 w m@xmath2 ( lower layer ) , and a total energy of about @xmath7 j ( upper layer ) or @xmath6 j ( lower layer ) .",
    "more than @xmath8 events exist at any instant on the sun , with a mean birth rate of 3500 s@xmath9 .",
    "most occur in intergranular lanes , downward velocity regions , and areas of converging motions .",
    "the peak of velocity amplitude ( 0.8 to 1 km s@xmath9 ) occurs after the maximum phase lag , which indicates an energy propagation speed of several km s@xmath9 . just before the time of peak flux ,",
    "converging flows seem to intensify .",
    "the strength of aes is correlated to the strength of convective flows , converging horizontal motions , and also to the darkness of intergranules .",
    "regions with fastest downward motions and strongest convergences , as well as darkest structures , produce the most energetic aes .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the details of the excitation mechanism are suspected to be stress and entropy fluctuations .",
    "analysis of observations and numerical simulations show that the sources of the solar oscillations are associated with downdrafts in dark intergranular lanes ( rimmele _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) , and near the boundaries of granules ( stein and nordlund , 2001 ) , as found here",
    ". it will be of great interest to locate aes with respect to families of granules which are formed from the evolution of trees of fragmenting granules , and which are related to larger scales as the mesogranulation and supergranulation ( roudier _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ) .",
    "this aim can be reached using a much longer observing run ( 6 h ) than the present one .",
    "such a run was performed ( 14 april 2010 ) and results will be presented in a further paper .",
    "we are grateful to the anonymous referee for helpful comments and suggestions and to r. stein for useful hints .",
    "we are also indebted to the _ hinode _ team for the possibility to use their data .",
    "_ hinode _ is a japanese mission developed and launched by isas / jaxa , collaborating with naoj as a domestic partner , nasa and stfc ( uk ) as international partners .",
    "scientific operation of the _ hinode _ mission is conducted by the _",
    "science team organized at isas / jaxa .",
    "this team mainly consists of scientists from institutes in the partner countries .",
    "support for the post - launch operation is provided by jaxa and naoj ( japan ) , stfc ( u.k . ) , nasa , esa , and nsc ( norway ) .      in order to compute the complex signal @xmath109",
    ", we used the temporal fft together with the following properties of the hilbert transform ( ht ) .",
    "given an observed signal @xmath110 , the ht @xmath63 is given by :                            we first computed the temporal ft of the observed signal @xmath110 ; in order to get the ft of the complex velocity @xmath109 , values corresponding to negative frequencies were eliminated and values corresponding to positive frequencies were doubled .",
    "finally , the complex velocity @xmath109 was derived from the inverse ft ."
