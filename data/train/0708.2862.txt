    "an in - plane magnetic field distorts the density of states ( dos ) @xcite of a quasi two - dimensional system because the spatial and the magnetic confinement compete .",
    "the energy dispersion in the @xmath3-plane has the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the subband index , @xmath6 is the spin , @xmath7 the in - plane wave vector perpendicular to the in - plane magnetic field , @xmath1 ( applied along @xmath8 ) , and @xmath9 is the growth axis .",

    "for this reason , in the past , the @xmath7-dependence has been quite often ignored , although this is only justified for narrow qws . with the existing computational power ,",
    "such a compromise is not any more necessary . in the limit @xmath17 , the dos retains the occasionally stereotypic staircase shape with the _ ideal _ step @xmath18 for each spin .",
    "the dos modification significantly affects the physical properties and specifically the spin - subband populations and spin polarization in dms quantum wells ( qws ) @xcite . for completeness",

    "here we briefly describe how the above mentioned dos determines the spin - subband populations and the spin - polarization as functions of @xmath1 and the temperature , @xmath0 , for dms single qws giving a few examples .",
    "calculations for double qws will hopefully be published in the future .",
    "for narrow qws , it has been shown @xcite that the dos is an almost `` perfect staircase '' with steps increasing only a few percent relatively to the ideal 2deg step .",
