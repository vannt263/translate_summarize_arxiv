    "recent years have seen a surge of interest in the evolution of extra - solar planetary systems through the late phases in the evolution of their host stars .",

    "while the survival of planets seems plausible @xcite , there is as yet no unambiguous detection of a planet around a white dwarf ( @xcite , but see also @xcite for a good candidate ) .",
    "comparison of the caii8498,8542,8662  emission lines in the sdss spectra of the three white dwarfs sdss1228 + 1040 ( top , @xcite ) , sdss0845 + 0855 ( middle ) and sdss1043 + 0855 ( bottom , @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra of sdss0845 + 0855 and sdss1228 + 1040 are offset by one and two units , respectively . ]    however , as part of a search for cool companions to white dwarfs , an infrared excess was discovered around the cool white dwarf g2938 @xcite .",
    "hst observations of g2938 revealed a large photospheric abundance of metals , implying that the star is accreting at a relatively high rate @xcite .",
    "deep imaging and asteroseismological studies of g2938 ruled out a brown dwarf companion @xcite and led to the hypothesis of a cool dust cloud around the white dwarf .",
    "the presence of dust near g2938 has been verified by infrared observations with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "recent infrared surveys have boosted the number of cool white dwarfs harbouring dust discs to @xmath10 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these dust discs originate from the tidal disruption of either comets @xcite or asteroids @xcite .",
    "asteroids appear to be more likely as they can explain the large metal abundances in the material accreted by the white dwarfs from the dusty environment .",
    "hydrogen - rich white dwarfs with radiative atmospheres ( @xmath11k ) have short diffusion time scales for heavy elements , and hence their photospheric abundances should closely reflect the chemical abundances of the circumstellar debris discs from which they are accreting .",
    "@xcite suggested that such systems offer potential insight into the chemical composition of extra - solar planetary systems , once more detailed calculations of diffusion time scales for a wide range of elements and atmospheric parameters are available .",
    "we have recently identified two hydrogen - dominated ( da ) white dwarfs , sdssj122859.93 + 104032.9 and sdssj104341.53 + 085558.2 ( henceforth sdss1228 + 1040 and sdss1043 + 0855 ) , that exhibit double - peaked emission lines in the @xmath12-band caii triplet @xcite . from the morphology of the caii lines profiles we inferred the presence of gaseous circumstellar discs close ( @xmath13 ) to the white dwarfs .",
    "like the majority of the white dwarfs with dusty debris discs , both sdss1228 + 1040 and sdss1043 + 0855 have hydrogen - rich metal - polluted ( daz ) atmospheres , indicating that they are accreting from the circumstellar material .",
    "the absence of photospheric helium absorption lines , as well as of balmer emission lines from the gaseous discs , strongly suggest that circumstellar material around sdss1228 + 1040 and sdss1043 + 0855 is depleted in volatile elements .",
    "a dusty extension to the gaseous disc in sdss1228 + 1040 has been detected with _",
    "@xcite .    here",
    "we present a third white dwarf with a metal - rich gaseous debris disc , the helium - dominated ( db ) sdssj084539.17 + 225728.0 ( henceforth sdss0845 + 2257 ) .",
    "we selected 15116 unique spectroscopic objects from data release6 of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss dr6 , @xcite ) that were classified by the sdss spectroscopic reduction pipeline as stars , and are bluer than the main sequence ( @xmath14 ) with relatively low uncertainties in their @xmath15-band photometry ( @xmath16mag ) .",
    "the spectra of these objects were subjected to an automatic measurement of the equivalent width of the caii8498,8542,8662triplet ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "this search resulted in a list of 484 candidates exhibiting a @xmath17 excess in the caii triplet over the neighbouring continuum , which were then visually inspected .",
    "the vast majority of the spectra flagged by our program are affected by poor night sky line subtraction in the case of sdss ) than a slit , resulting in a larger contamination by sky background , and ( b ) the sky subtraction is done via dedicated sky fibres that are placed some distance away from the target fibre , which can result in different optical paths , spectroscopic responses , etc .",
    "in addition , any small offset in wavelength between the sky spectrum and object spectrum will result in large residuals near strong sky lines . ] . among the 484 candidates , we identified 82 cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) exhibiting caii emission , most of which were previously discovered ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the spectra of all those cvs contain strong and broad balmer emission lines , and in most cases noticeable he emission lines as well .",
    "only three apparently single white dwarfs with unambiguous emission in all three components of the caii triplet were found ( fig.[f - caii ] ) : the two previously known da white dwarfs with gaseous debris discs , sdss1228 + 1040 and sdss1043 + 0855 , and the first db white dwarf displaying caii emission , sdss0845 + 2257 ( fig.[f - opt_fit ] ) .",
    "sdss0845 + 2257 has been previously identified as a uv - excess source ( pg0842 + 231 , ton 345 ) and classified as an sdo subdwarf @xcite .",
    "the absence of close companion to these three white dwarfs is suggested by the complete lack of either balmer or he emission lines in their optical spectra .",
    "the single white dwarf nature of sdss1228 + 1040 was corroborated by extensive time - resolved spectroscopy and photometry , which ruled out the presence of short - period radial velocity variations and brightness modulations @xcite . by analogy to sdss1228 + 1040 , we infer that sdss0845 + 2257 is also a single white dwarf harbouring a metal - rich gaseous accretion disc fed from circumstellar debris .",
    "the double - peaked caii profiles in sdss0845 + 2257 display a strong asymmetry ( fig.[f - caii ] ) , suggesting a stronger ellipticity and/or azimuthal brightness variation of the gaseous ring than in the other two systems .",
    "closer inspection of the sdss spectrum revealed also weak emission of feii 5169 , as well as narrow , weak absorption lines of ca , si , and mg originating in the helium - dominated atmosphere of the white dwarf .",
    "intermediate resolution spectroscopy of sdss0845 + 2257 was obtained on january 2 , 2008 using the double - arm spectrograph isis on the william herschel telescope . in the blue arm , we used the r600b grating and a 4k@xmath182k pixel eev detector , and in the red arm the r316r grating and a low - fringing 4k@xmath182k pixel redplus detector .",
    "this setup provided a wavelength coverage of @xmath19  at a resolution of @xmath20  and @xmath21  at a resolution of @xmath22 .",
    "two pairs of blue / red spectra with individual exposure times of 15min were obtained under average atmospheric conditions , i.e. thin cirrus and @xmath23 seeing .",
    "the data were reduced following the methods described in @xcite . the wht spectra confirmed the presence of photospheric ca , si , and mg absorption lines , and , more importantly , reveal a significant change in the shape and strength of the caii triplet with respect to the sdss spectrum .",
    "fig.[f - caii_time ] compares the sdss and the wht spectra , and also indicates the wavelengths of strong night sky lines .",
    "it is clear that the observed change in the caii line profiles is intrinsic to sdss0845 + 2257 , and not caused by differences in the sky subtraction between the sdss and wht spectra .",
    "we fitted the sdss spectrum of sdss0845 + 2257 following the methods outlined in @xcite using the synthetic spectra calculated with the model atmosphere code described by @xcite . using pure he atmosphere models , the best - fit is achieved for @xmath24k and @xmath25 .    in a second step ,",
    "we have investigated the abundances of h , ca , mg , and si . from the absence of h@xmath7 absorption , we determine @xmath8 . a model calculated with @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath5 , and @xmath6 provides an acceptable fit of the observed photospheric absorption , with an estimated uncertainty of a factor two in the abundances .",
    "a more detailed analysis will have to await data of higher spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ratio , and if possible extension of the spectroscopic observations into the ultraviolet which contains thousands of lines of a large number of chemical elements .    adopting a hydrogen abundance of @xmath26 results only in modest changes in the best - fit effective temperature and surface gravity , @xmath27k and @xmath28 .",
    "the quoted errors are of purely statistical nature , and should be regarded as a strict lower limit . based on our experience , we suggest that realistic errors are 500k for @xmath3 and 0.2dex for @xmath29 . using wood s ( @xcite ) mass - radius relation and cooling models",
    ", we find a mass of @xmath30 and a cooling age of @xmath31myr .",
    "the double - peaked caii emission lines changed significantly both in morphology and equivalent width between the sdss spectrum taken in december 2004 , and our wht spectrum taken in january 2008 ( fig .",
    "[ f - caii_time ] ) .",
    "these changes clearly demonstrate that the circumstellar material is undergoing some kind of evolution on time scales as short as years .",
    "we have modelled both sets of observed caii emission line profiles ( fig.[f - caii_time ] ) following the prescription outlined in @xcite . in brief , the disc is represented by a set of co - aligned elliptical orbits of constant eccentricity .",
    "the emissivity varies as a power law in radius and varies azimuthally as a sinusoid with maximum and minimum flux along the semi - major axis .",
    "the only difference from @xcite is that we automated the optimisation of the model to minimise @xmath32 .",
    "the sdss spectrum can be modelled by emission from a disc with an inner and outer radius of @xmath33  and @xmath34 , with an eccentricity of @xmath35 .",
    "the wht spectrum is best - fit by a disc with an inner radius of @xmath36  and @xmath37 , with an eccentricity of @xmath38 .",
    "our model suffers from degeneracies between different parameters , and consequently these numbers should be considered as guidance , rather than exact results .",
    "however , the following conclusions appear to be firm .",
    "sdss0845 + 2257 hosts an eccentric circumstellar disc of metal - rich gas with caii emission originating over a radial extent of @xmath0  to @xmath1 . while the radial extension of the caii gas is similar to that found in sdss1228 + 1040 @xcite , the eccentricity of the disc in sdss0845 + 2257 is substantially larger .",
    "we have initiated a spectroscopic monitoring of sdss1228 + 1040 and sdss0845 + 2257 that will hopefully provide more insight into the dynamical evolution of their circumstellar discs .",
    "the origin of metals in the atmospheres of cool white dwarfs has been subject to long debate , with accretion from the interstellar medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) having been the most widely accepted scenario until recently . the discovery of circumstellar dust discs around a number of white dwarfs with metal - polluted atmospheres ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) led to the suggestion that accretion of comets @xcite or asteroids @xcite may contribute to the pollution of white dwarfs with heavy elements .    in the case of daz white dwarfs , which have hydrogen - dominated atmospheres , the relative abundances of hydrogen and metals within the accreted material are difficult to gauge .",
    "in contrast to this , metal - polluted white dwarfs with helium - rich atmospheres allow much tighter constraints on the hydrogen abundance of the accreted material . @xcite and @xcite showed for the dbz white dwarfs gd40 and hs2253 + 8023 that whereas the metal - to - metal abundance ratios were consistent with accretion from the ism , the hydrogen - to - metal abundance ratio has to be @xmath39 lower than typical ism abundances to be consistent with the observed spectra of the two dbz white dwarfs . in a later paper , @xcite ruled out that a weak magnetic field acting as a propeller might suppress the accretion of hydrogen in gd40 .",
    "recently , @xcite detected infrared excess around gd40 which strongly supports the hypothesis that the metals in the atmosphere of the white dwarf are related to ongoing accretion from a disc of hydrogen - depleted dust .",
    "@xcite took the argument of accretion of asteroid debris in gd40 a step further , suggesting that the apparent carbon - to - iron deficiency in the atmosphere of the star is similar to the abundance pattern of chondritic asteroids .",
    "besides gd40 , sdss0845 + 2257 is only the second bona - fide dbz white dwarf in which a circumstellar disc has been detected .",
    "our current observations constrain the metal - to - hydrogen abundance ratio of the accreted material to be @xmath40 times larger than observed in the sun , which strongly supports @xcite s ( @xcite ) scenario of metal pollution by ongoing accretion from tidally disrupted asteroids .",
    "while db white dwarfs allow tight constraints on the hydrogen fraction in the accreted material , the sedimentation times for metals are many orders of magnitude larger than in da white dwarfs ( @xcite ; e.g. @xmath41yr for sdss0845 + 2257 vs. days in sdss1228 + 1040 ) , and may differ by factors of a few for different chemical species . in order to reach an accretion / diffusion steady state ,",
    "the white dwarf has to accrete at a constant rate for 23times the diffusion time scale , i.e. close to @xmath42yr in the case of sdss0845 + 2257 .",
    "it seems unlikely that an asteroid debris disc can sustain a constant mass loss rate for such a long period of time . in the case of time - dependent accretion rates ,",
    "the observed metal - to - metal abundance ratios will be variable .",
    "@xcite presented a time - dependent model of accretion onto white dwarfs , adopting a variation in accretion rate by a factor @xmath43 , and found that observed mg / ca , si / ca , and fe / ca metal - to - metal ratios could differ by up to a factor 100 , depending on the timing of the observations with respect to the change in accretion rate .",
    "we conclude that , given the long diffusion time scales , the metal - to - metal abundance ratios seen in a dbz atmosphere are unlikely to be an immediate proxy for the chemical abundances of the circumstellar material .",
    "we have identified sdss0845 + 2257 as the third white dwarf known to host a metal - rich gaseous circumstellar disc .",
    "sdss0845 + 2257 has a similar temperature as sdss1043 + 0855 and sdss1228 + 1040 , and all three are substantially hotter ( @xmath44k ) compared to the majority of the white dwarfs with dusty discs identified in surveys for infrared excess fluxes .",
    "the total roster of white dwarfs with gaseous and/or dusty debris discs stands at 13 , of which @xmath45% were identified through the presence of caii emission lines in their sdss spectra . taking the masses of the three white dwarfs with gaseous debris discs at face value , we find @xmath46 , which is marginally higher than the mean mass of field white dwarfs @xcite . a speculative line of thought is that the potentially higher occurence of debris discs around more massive white dwarfs is related to the higher frequency of debris discs around a - stars compared to sun - like stars @xcite .",
    "in contrast to sdss1228 + 1040 and sdss1043 + 0857 , sdss0845 + 2257 has a helium - dominated atmosphere and the detection of ca , mg , and si absorption lines qualifies it as a dbz white dwarf . the presence of a circumstellar disc strongly suggests that ongoing accretion is the origin of the observed photospheric metals .",
    "the non - detection of h@xmath7 absorption in the sdss spectrum of sdss0845 + 2257 implies that the hydrogen - to - metal ratio in the circumstellar material is at least a factor 1000 smaller than the solar value @xcite .",
    "the most likely origin of the metal - rich material is the planetary debris , such as the tidal disruption of a rocky asteroid @xcite .    modelling",
    "the broad double - peaked caii emission lines observed in sdss0845 + 2257 with a keplerian gas disc confines the region of the caii emission to a radial extension of @xmath0  to @xmath1 .",
    "the line profiles display a large asymmetry , which we interpret as a significant asymmetry in the gaseous disc .",
    "the line profile shapes and equivalent widths of the caii emission lines varied substantially in between two observations taken @xmath47 years apart . following the detection of variability in the equivalent widths of the photospheric cah , k absorption lines lines seen in g2938 @xcite ,",
    "this is the second piece of evidence indicating that the structure of circumstellar debris around white dwarfs undergo changes on relatively short time scales .",
    "@xcite suggested that rather than a single tidal disruption event , white dwarfs with remnants of planetary systems may experience repeated accretion of small asteroids .",
    "such recurrent events may potentially be related to variability such as observed in sdss0845 + 2257 .",
    "whatever the cause of the changes in the caii emission lines , long - term monitoring of sdss0845 + 2257 is likely to offer direct dynamical insight into the evolution of debris discs around white dwarfs .",
