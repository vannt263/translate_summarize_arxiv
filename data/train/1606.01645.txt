    "<S> nonequilibrium physics of rare events , or fluctuations , is an unique fingerprint of a given system . by virtue of its very nature </S>",
    "<S> , it differs from the nonequilibrium physics enclosed in the system s mean quantities and provides an experimental alternative to conclusively uncover various microscopic structures . here , using a keldysh field theory with fermionic topological constraints </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that in noninteracting systems , whose dynamics is driven by majorana states , the effective charge @xmath0 , characterizing the electric current fluctuations , is fractional . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to noninteracting dirac systems with the trivial electronic charge , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> quite the opposite , in the majorana state we predict two different fractional effective charges at low and high energies , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which can be accessed at low and high bias voltages , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we show that while the low energy effective charge @xmath2 is sensitive to thermal fluctuations of the current , the high energy effective charge @xmath3 is robust against thermal noise and represents an unique fluctuation signature of majorana fermions in experiments on strongly nonequilibrium systems even at high temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> the physics of fluctuation phenomena , or noise , dating back to brownian @xcite motion has received a systematic scientific framework after the einstein s @xcite and smoluchowski s @xcite conceptual theoretical breakthrough proven experimentally by svedberg @xcite and perrin @xcite . spontaneous or excited by external perturbations fluctuations represent an extremely insightful experimental tool known as the fluctuation spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> this technique is highly sensitive and , as a result , it scans the microscopic structure of a system in question in much more detail than it could be addressed in terms of the expectation values of the system s observables .    in equilibrium , nevertheless , kinetics of a given system makes a clever link between random deviations of its physical quantities from expectation values and the expectation values themselves . </S>",
    "<S> this link dating back to the nyquist s @xcite and callen s and welton s @xcite fundamental discovery is known as the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .    in nonequilibrium , however , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem breaks and , therefore , for a given system its fluctuation physics becomes independent of the physics which governs behavior of the system s mean quantities . here </S>",
    "<S> the piece of information obtained from fluctuation spectroscopy has often no counterparts in equilibrium fluctuations or even in principle can not be obtained in equilibrium as it happens , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , in the case of the resistance fluctuations in metals known as the modulation noise . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , even when a system is only slightly , in a certain sense , perturbed out of its equilibrium state the nonequilibrium noise might be comparable to or , in fact , become stronger than the equilibrium noise . </S>",
    "<S> thus , nonequilibrium noise experiments are a reliable and comprehensive method to conclusively reveal the microscopic structure of a system when measurements of its mean quantities are physically inconclusive .    </S>",
    "<S> this is what currently happens in another fascinating field of modern condensed matter physics dealing with materialization of a particle cloning its own antiparticle . </S>",
    "<S> namely , via unpairing majorana @xcite fermions , composing a single dirac fermion , by means of different implementations @xcite of the kitaev s @xcite model it is hoped to be able to detect a single majorana state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an experimental proof of the theoretical predictions , however , mainly focuses on measurements of mean quantities such as the differential conductance which , as a function of a bias voltage , should exhibit a peak with the maximum equal to one - half of the unitary limit known for dirac fermions . this way of experimental @xcite detecting unpaired majorana fermions </S>",
    "<S> is argued to be inconclusive . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , such a peak structure of the differential conductance might result , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , from the kondo effect @xcite taking place in a mesoscopic system asymmetrically coupled to contacts by means of which the bias voltage is applied to this system . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is inherent to many transport majorana s experiments dealing with mean quantities . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it is possible to get a conclusive signature of majorana fermions from the mean value description if , instead of transport , one resorts to thermodynamic signatures of majorana fermions @xcite .    the freedom to involve nonequilibrium noise in the fluctuation spectroscopy of majorana fermions triggers transport experiments on majorana physics to a new azimuth and makes it more interesting . </S>",
    "<S> this is because , as mentioned above , fluctuations are usually conclusive on the microscopic structure of a system and at the same time these are transport experiments which are in general simpler than thermodynamic ones . </S>",
    "<S> for example , experiments @xcite on nonequilibrium fluctuations in quantum dots have at present reached a remarkable accuracy and significantly extend our understanding of the kondo effect . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , these experiments enable one to measure the noise of the electric current and provide an essential characteristic of nonequilibrium fluctuations known as the effective charge , @xmath0 , which is an unique fluctuation fingerprint of a given system .    in the present work we explore strongly nonequilibrium fluctuations of the electric current flowing through a noninteracting quantum dot coupled to a topological superconductor supporting at its ends two majorana bound states implemented via the kitaev s chain model . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that in the absence of majorana fermions the effective charge for a noninteracting quantum dot is trivial and identical to the electronic charge , @xmath1 . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that in the presence of majorana fermions 1 ) the effective charge fractionalizes to 2 ) @xmath2 at low energies , to 3 ) @xmath3 at high energies and show that 4 ) even when the low energy effective charge @xmath2 is washed out by , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , thermal noise , the high energy effective charge @xmath3 is robust and persists up to very high temperatures providing a simple and reliable experimental platform for an unique signature of majorana fermions out of strongly nonequilibrium fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a setup similar to the one of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . it represents a noninteracting quantum dot coupled via tunneling interaction to two ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) noninteracting contacts . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the equilibrium setup of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , here the contacts may be used to apply a bias voltage @xmath6 to the quantum dot , @xmath7 , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum dot has a one single particle level which is spin nondegenerate as may be experimentally implemented , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , by means of the zeeman splitting which also filters out the kondo effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note also that below we explore strongly nonequilibrium states which are accessed at very high bias voltage @xmath6 so that the kondo state totally ruined @xcite in any case and , therefore , does not lead to any experimental ambiguity . finally , </S>",
    "<S> similar to ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the quantum dot interacts via another tunneling mechanism with a grounded topological superconductor supporting at its ends two majorana bound states .    to give the problem a concrete and mathematically convenient treatment </S>",
    "<S> we formulate it in terms of the quantum many - particle keldysh lagrangian @xmath9 which constitutes the basis for the keldysh action , @xmath10 . here the momenta @xmath11 and coordinates @xmath12 are the fermionic coherent states of the system and there conjugate partners , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian formulation is fully equivalent to the quantum hamiltonian @xmath13 formulation but has a certain technical advantage in calculating strongly nonequilibrium fluctuations of the electric current via the keldysh field integral @xcite which we employ below to obtain the current - current correlation function .    </S>",
    "<S> for the quantum dot ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , contacts ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) and tunneling between them we , respectively , have : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the quantum dot energy level and the real time @xmath20 runs along the keldysh closed contour @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 where below we will assume identical quantum numbers @xmath24 in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 contacts as well as large contacts so that their spectrum @xmath25 is continuous and their density of states @xmath26 is constant in the vicinity of the fermi energy , @xmath27 where below we use for the dirac tunneling the standard assumption that the tunneling matrix elements weakly depend on the contacts quantum numbers , @xmath28 , which allows one to characterize the tunneling coupling by the energy scale @xmath29 or @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> we will also assume that @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the topological ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) part of the hamiltonian is given as the sum of the hamiltonians of the topological superconductor and its tunneling interaction with the quantum dot : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the energy originating from the overlap of the majorana bound states @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( in particular , @xmath38 if there is no overlap as in sufficiently long kitaev s chains ) , @xmath39 where the majorana tunneling entangles the dirac fermions of the quantum dot with only one majorana state , @xmath36 , and is characterized by the energy scale @xmath40 .    due to the fundamental property of the majorana fields , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and the canonic fermionic anticommutation relations the field integral for the keldysh partition function , @xmath43 is a functional integral with the constraints @xmath41 , @xmath44 which might be viewed as fermionic topological constraints . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , if @xmath45 , @xmath46 , then any fermionic topological constraint is absent and , as usual , @xmath47 , @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , because of the presence of the topological superconductor , here one deals with a fermionic topological field integral and the whole problem represents a sort of a topological field theory . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , since the hamiltonian @xmath49 is quadratic in all @xmath11 , @xmath12 , this topological field integral may be easily solved exactly as in many standard textbooks @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> using an imaginary time field theory , it has been rigorously proven @xcite by entropic reasoning that a macroscopic state of the above setup is majorana dominated at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it must exhibit various fractionalizations @xcite of its observables . here , in particular , we are interested in fractionalizations of the electric current fluctuations .    to this end </S>",
    "<S> we introduce suitable sources into the keldysh partition function ( [ z_k ] ) turning it into the keldysh generating functional : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the source field and @xmath52 is the electric current field . </S>",
    "<S> the mean current and current - current correlator are then obtained by proper functional differentiations of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ j_l ] ) with respect to the source field . here , calculating the current - current correlator </S>",
    "<S> , one should remember that due to the topological superconductor ( or fermionic topological constraints present in the field integral ) various anomalous expectation values do not vanish , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , in general @xmath53 also includes the term @xmath54 .     </S>",
    "<S> the second derivative of the current noise , @xmath55 , as a function of the second derivative of the mean current times the electronic charge @xmath56 , @xmath57/dv^2 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the curves are parameterized by the bias voltage @xmath6 which grows in the direction of the arrows from @xmath58 to @xmath59 . for both curves </S>",
    "<S> the temperature is the same , @xmath60 . the black curve is for @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the red curve is for @xmath62.,width=8 ]     the second derivative of the current noise , @xmath55 , as a function of the second derivative of the mean current times the electronic charge @xmath56 , @xmath57/dv^2 $ ] . </S>",

    "<S> the temperatures are @xmath60 ( black ) , @xmath63 ( red ) , @xmath64 ( blue ) and @xmath65 ( green ) . </S>",
    "<S> the curves are parameterized by the bias voltage @xmath6 which grows in the direction of the arrows from @xmath58 to @xmath59 ( black ) , from @xmath66 to @xmath59 ( red ) , from @xmath67 to @xmath59 ( blue ) and from @xmath68 to @xmath59 ( green).,width=8 ]    below we are interested in the so called greater current - current correlator @xmath69 ( as opposed to the lesser one , @xmath70 ) , where @xmath71 is the current fluctuation field and @xmath72 is the mean current . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we calculate the fourier component @xmath73 as a function of the bias voltage @xmath6 at zero frequency , @xmath74 .    </S>",
    "<S> the essential and experimentally relevant characteristic of the electric current fluctuations is the effective charge @xmath0 which relates the nonlinear parts of @xmath75 and @xmath76 . in modern experiments </S>",
    "<S> @xcite on nonequilibrium current fluctuations in quantum dots one measures the shot noise , @xmath75 , and the mean current , @xmath76 , subtracts the linear parts to get the corresponding nonlinear quantities @xmath77 , @xmath78 and finally obtains the ratio @xmath79 at small bias voltages . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for noninteracting quantum dots one gets the trivial result , @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> we generalize the above definition of the effective charge in such a way that it reproduces not only the standard definition at small bias voltages but also provides an unique fluctuation fingerprint of a system far from equilibrium where the system s dynamics is highly nonlinear and the expansion in powers of @xmath6 makes no sense at all . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we note that at small values of @xmath80 the nonlinear parts of both the shot noise and the mean current are cubic in @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at low voltages the second derivatives @xmath55 and @xmath81 are linear in @xmath6 and thus linearly depend on each other with the ratio @xmath82/|d^2[ei(v)]/dv^2|=s^>_k(v)/e|i_k(v)|$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we define the effective charge as : @xmath83}{dv^2}\\big| } , \\label{eff_ch}\\ ] ] which is applicable when the second derivatives linearly depend on each other . note , that the linear dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath81 does not necessarily imply a linear dependence of these derivatives on the bias voltage . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , at large bias voltages expansions in powers of @xmath6 do not exist while @xmath55 may still linearly depend on @xmath81 and , therefore , the effective charge in eq . ( [ eff_ch ] ) makes sense even at extremely high bias voltages .    note also that the definition in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eff_ch ] ) is highly consistent because , as shown below , in the absence of majorana fermions it gives for the noninteracting case @xmath1 both at low and very large bias voltages . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , this definition is also highly relevant for experiments because each of the second derivatives may be measured with sufficient accuracy already at present .     </S>",

    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure_1 ] shows @xmath55 as a function of @xmath81 when @xmath85 for two different values of the overlap energy @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the black curve is for @xmath61 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the majorana fermions strongly overlap forming a single dirac fermion leading to the current fluctuations with the trivial effective charge equal to the electronic charge both at low ( @xmath86 ) and high ( @xmath87 ) energies . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the curve is linear near the origin both at its starting point and at its ending point with the tangent lines having unit absolute slope resulting in @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> however , when @xmath62 , majorana bound states overlap weakly and the fluctuation physics is governed by fractional degrees of freedom leading to fractional effective charges at low and high energies . in this case the curve is linear near the origin both at its starting point and at its ending point with the tangent lines having , respectively , absolute slopes equal to 1/2 and 3/2 resulting in @xmath2 at low energies ( @xmath86 ) and @xmath3 at high energies ( @xmath89 ) . at voltages @xmath90 </S>",
    "<S> the majorana state is ineffective and the curve acquires the trivial linear character with @xmath1 . strictly speaking , the fractional high energy effective charge @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> is perfectly achieved only at @xmath91 which requires @xmath92 . however , according to our numerical analysis we estimate that for @xmath84 ( and small @xmath35 ) it weakly deviates from the value @xmath93 . </S>",

    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath103 and , as mentioned above , the kondo state is ruined by high bias voltages . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the kondo effect will not create any ambiguity in experimental observations of the fractional high energy effective charge @xmath3 .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure_2 ] we show @xmath55 as a function of @xmath81 for @xmath85 , @xmath62 for different temperatures . since the overlap energy is small , the current fluctuations are essentially governed by the majorana degrees of freedom . here </S>",
    "<S> we increase the bias voltage of the starting points of the high temperature curves to stay in the regime @xmath104 in order to avoid high values of the thermal majorana noise which is not in the focus of the present research . at high temperatures ( red , blue and green curves ) </S>",
    "<S> the low energy effective charge @xmath2 is completely washed out by thermal fluctuations of the electric current . </S>",
    "<S> however , the high energy effective charge @xmath3 is robust against thermal noise and persists up to very high temperatures , @xmath65 ( green curve ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us estimate the temperature at which the fractional high energy effective charge @xmath3 might be observed in experiments . if the induced superconducting gap is taken from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , then we obtain @xmath107 which is easily reachable in modern experiments . if the induced superconducting gap is taken from ref . </S>",

    "<S> [ figure_3 ] demonstrates @xmath55 as a function of @xmath81 for @xmath85 , @xmath110 . here </S>",
    "<S> the majorana state is destroyed by the strong overlap of the majorana bound states and the current fluctuations are governed only by the dirac fermions of the quantum dot . similar to the majorana dominated regime the low energy effective charge is not well defined here too due to thermal fluctuations of the electric current . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> the high energy effective charge persists up to very high temperatures , @xmath65 ( green curve ) , and gives the trivial electronic charge @xmath111 as it must be in the absence of majorana fermions .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we would like to note that the fractional low energy effective charge @xmath112 characterizes the current fluctuations also in the regime @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fractional high energy effective charge @xmath3 does not appear in this regime because of the dominant role of the quantum dot dirac fermions in the current fluctuations already at moderate bias voltages . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the high energy fluctuations in this regime are always characterized by the trivial effective charge @xmath111 .    in conclusion , we have explored strongly nonequilibrium majorana fluctuations of the electric current . it has been shown that in general these fluctuations are characterized by two fractional effective charges @xmath2 and @xmath3 at low and high energies , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that the low energy effective charge @xmath2 might be washed out by thermal noise but the high energy effective charge @xmath3 is robust and persists up to very high temperatures . </S>",
