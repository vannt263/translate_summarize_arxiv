    "the initial polarization of cnlse and its evolution during the qp interaction is a very important element .",
    "there are numerous experimental observations ( see @xcite and cited there literature ) of the effects connected with this quantity . for the full fledged cnlse with general initial polarization",

    "the latter yielded two very important advantages : fully implicit scheme and implementation of the conservation laws on difference level within the round - off error of the calculations .",
    "the above scheme was extended to complex arithmetic in @xcite where the computer code for gaussian elimination with pivoting of @xcite was generalized for complex - valued multi - diagonal band algebraic systems .",
    "having in mind the importance of initial polarization , we investigated in @xcite the collision dynamics for circularly polarized solitons based on @xmath0-functions and found out that there exist infinite number of manakov two - soliton solutions preceded by polarization discontinuity ( shock ) on the place of interaction . in order to extend the range of investigations in the case of general polarization we established an auxiliary conjugate system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations @xcite in order to generate numerically initial elliptically polarized soliton solutions and applied them for numerous head - on @xcite and takeover collisions @xcite . to enrich the concept of the polarization we involved into considerations linear coupling of @xmath0-like solitons which is a generator of their rotational polarization ( breathing ) and/or gain / self - dissipation @xcite . in this work",

    "we consider the two main interactions  head - on and takeover collisions of envelopes when only a real linear coupling @xmath8 is present ( the cross - modulation parameter @xmath5 ) .",
    "adding an imaginary part in @xmath8 leads to gain / blow - up of the solution accompanied by a violation of the conservation laws ( see @xcite ) and we will not concern again this property in the present work .",
    "the main conclusions can be summarized as follows    * the interaction conserves perfectly the pseudomomenta and energy .",
    "the pseudomomenta are not influenced by the initial phase difference @xmath35\\!]\\>}$ ] while the magnitude of the energy is strongly dependent on it .",
    "the variation is nonmonotonous .",
    "* the total mass is also perfectly conserved but this is realized on the inner share and exchange of local masses of both components of qp periodically in the time .",
    "this periodicity is governed by the real part of the linear coupling @xmath8 and generates breathing of the masses among with the breathing of the solitary envelopes .",
    "the mass breathing does not depend on the interaction and is present during the whole time of evolution .",
    "the amplitude of mass oscillation depends on the initial phase difference . *",
    "the individual polarizations breathe similar to individual masses but in opposite to them with a phase shift .",
    "this is the reason the total rotational polarization to be conserved within one period . on the place of interaction the individual and total polarization angles suffer a discontinuity keeping the else functions smooth . in other words",
    "the total polarization breathes also and a bifurcation occurs during the cross - section of the interaction . and",
    "this is the main result of this investigation .",
    "the amplitudes of the individual polarizations are affected by the initial phase difference .",
    "* we found and generalized for the case of rotational polarization one more conservation law  for the net total polarization .",
    "so , the linearly cnlse possess four conservation laws : for the total mass , for the pseudomomentum , for the energy , and for the magnitude of the total polarization .",
    "let us emphasize that the last law has not an analytic analogue and it unearths more intrinsic information for the propagating and interacting solitons as quasi - particles .",
