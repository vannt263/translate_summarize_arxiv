    "conjugated organic materials have a variety of applications . they are already being used in organic light emitting diodes ( oleds ) and organic thin - film transistors.@xcite they are also considered to be potential candidates for single - molecule electronic and spintronic devices .",
    "the issue of spin and charge transport in @xmath3-conjugated organic systems , therefore , is of prime importance .",
    "thus , it is both important and necessary to understand the role of chemical modifications ( substituents ) on the dynamics of spin and charge transport in these systems .",
    "electrons in these molecular materials experience strong electron correlations by virtue of reduced dimensionality and these interactions are also long - ranged since the systems are semiconducting .",
    "therefore , to study transport of charge and spin in these systems , it is necessary to have appropriate models as well as techniques .",
    "dynamics in interacting systems can be studied either in the frequency or in the real - time domain .",
    "the dynamics of strongly interacting systems in the frequency domain has been possible due to the lanczos and correction vector techniques @xcite using both exact diagonalization method for small systems , and the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method for large systems .",
    "studying dynamics in the real - time domain throws a lot more light into the transport mechanism .",
    "exact time dependent techniques are possible only for small interacting systems .",
    "the advent of the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( td - dmrg ) method has allowed the study of _ out - of - equilibrium _ dynamics in large low - dimensional strongly correlated systems.@xcite recently , we have investigated non - equilibrium dynamics of spin and charge transport in unsubstituted polyenes , which are a class of @xmath3-conjugated organic materials , using the _",
    "double time window targeting _ ( dtwt ) td - dmrg technique developed by us.@xcite in the present paper we extend our studies to address non - equilibrium spin and charge dynamics in the _ push - pull _ polyenes , characterized by the presence of an electron donating ( push ) group , and an electron accepting ( pull ) group , schematically represented as @xmath0 .",
    "presence of the donor and acceptor groups polarizes the @xmath3-electron bridge such that there is partial charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor group .",

    "a_.@xcite this leads to the naive expectation that these groups will have significant influence on spin - charge dynamics .",

    "however , we find that the _ d _ and _ a _ groups have no significant effect on spin and charge velocities in the push - pull polyenes .",
    "consequently , the charge and spin velocities in push - pull polyenes remain almost equal to those in unsubstituted polyenes ( table ii ) .",
    "the push - pull substitution however , has an effect on the amount of charge transported , as seen from the depths of the minima in the time evolution profiles of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "however , depth of the minima in @xmath45 or @xmath46 do not change ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , implying that the push - pull groups have no influence on the spin degree of freedom of the hole .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this implies that even though the spin and charge velocities in @xmath0 polyenes remain largely unaffected by the donor - acceptor strengths , the amount of charge transferred in unit time decreases with increase in @xmath31 as seen from the decrease in depth of the minima , when a hole is doped at the donor site .",
    "we can expect the opposite of when we dope an electron at the donor site ; more charge will be transported from the donor in these cases as @xmath31 increases .",
    "our results indicate that push - pull substitutions do not alter the many - body character of the @xmath0 polyenes , and that spin and charge velocities are controlled by the correlation strength while the magnitude of charge transfer is controlled by the strength of the substituents .    to understand in detail , the reason for the inability of the donor and acceptor groups to alter the many - body character of the @xmath0 polyenes , we compute the inverse of the charge gap ( @xmath81 ) and spin gap ( @xmath82 ) of the push - pull polyenes . if @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 denote the ground state energies of the @xmath86-particle , @xmath87-particle and @xmath5-particle systems respectively , then the charge gap is given by , @xmath88 similarly , the spin gap is defined as , @xmath89 where , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the lowest energy states of the @xmath0 polyenes with @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively . in fig .",
    "2 , we have plotted the variation in @xmath95 and @xmath96 as a function of the strength of the push - pull groups .",
    "it is clearly observed that the donor - acceptor groups fail to alter either of the gaps , as a result of which , the velocities of the spin and charge remain unaffected .     +    comparing figs . 1 and 3 it is clear that the dynamics of spin and charge transport in the @xmath1 chains is very different from that in the push - pull polyenes , owing to the different @xmath97 values and site energies of carbon and nitrogen atoms .",
    "for example , unlike in push - pull polyenes ( where the charge and spin of the injected hole after decoupling , oscillate back and forth between sites @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) in the @xmath1 systems , the oscillations are damped and the spin and charge of the injected hole do not return after reaching the chain end .",
    "this is demonstrated by the observation that , although the first dip in the time evolution profiles of @xmath44 and @xmath46 are well defined , there are no well defined second ( major ) minima in the @xmath43 and @xmath45 curves as a function of time .",
    "this may be because the hopping of an electron between unlike atoms is not a degenerate resonant tunneling process and hence , is not strictly reversible .    in order to investigate the fate of the injected hole , we study the temporal variation of total charge and spin densities in the left and right halves of pmi chains of 30 and 40 sites , for @xmath31 = 0.0 ( fig .",
    "the total charge and spin densities for the left ( right ) half are defined as , @xmath98 = @xmath99 @xmath100 , and @xmath101 = @xmath99 @xmath102 ( @xmath57 @xmath103 @xmath104 $ ] , @xmath105 @xmath103 @xmath106 $ ] ) , respectively .",
    "these quantities serve as simple but effective probes to understand the motion of charge and spin of the hole , as they travel from the half of the system where charge injection occured to the opposite half of the system .",
    "if the time evolution profiles of these observables show significant oscillatory behavior , it implies that the charge and spin propagate back and forth between the ends of the system .",
    "however , if the oscillatory behavior is not pronounced and both the observables attain some average value , it signifies that the charge ( spin ) moves in a such a manner that a `` quasi - static '' state is generated in which charge ( spin ) distribution of the system remains unchanged within the time of study .",
    "it is observed from fig .",
    "4 that for both the chain lengths , @xmath107 goes from 0.0 to @xmath200.25 while , @xmath108 goes from an initial value of @xmath200.5 to @xmath200.25 .",
    "once these quantities have attained the value of @xmath200.25 , they start to oscillate with time about this average value .",
    "the charge densities for the left and right halves of the pmi chains are however , found to behave little differently . in the case of the 30 site chain",
    "it is observed that , @xmath109 and @xmath110 take the average values of @xmath11114.25 and @xmath11114.75 , while for the longer chain of 40 sites , these quantities oscillate about a mean value of @xmath11119.5 .",
    "these data suggest that in the @xmath112 systems , with increase in system size , within the computational time a `` quasi - static '' state is achieved more rapidly .",
    "to understand this `` quasi - static '' state in more detail , we plot the time evolution profiles of charge and spin densities on carbon and nitrogen atoms in both halves of unsubstituted pmi chains of 30 and 40 sites ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "these quantities are defined as , @xmath113 where @xmath57 @xmath103 @xmath104 $ ] and @xmath105 @xmath103 @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "it is observed from figs .",
    "5(ii ) and 5(iv ) that the oscillations in time , of @xmath114 and @xmath115 , are opposite in phase , signifying that spin densities on the carbon and nitrogen atoms ( in both half ) are antiferromagnetically coupled to each other .",
    "however , the total spin density carried by carbon atoms in both halves is found to be less than that carried by the nitrogen atoms .",
    "furthermore it is seen that with time , both @xmath116 and @xmath117 decrease , while @xmath118 and @xmath119 increase in magnitude , keeping the total spin density in either half at @xmath200.25 . from figs .",
    "5(i ) and 5(iii ) we see that the average value of @xmath120 is less than @xmath121 , and the total charge density carried by nitrogen atoms on the right half of pmi chains is more compared to that in the left half in line with the fact that the nitrogens are the `` acceptor '' atoms , being more electronegative .",
    "the opposite is seen for the carbon atoms .",
    "the time evolution profiles of total spin densities on carbon and nitrogen in both halves , compared to the total charge densities , are found to be more oscillatory .",
    "+    all these observations suggest that the `` quasi - static '' state is characterized by charge and spin of the hole distributed between the left and right halves of the chain in almost equal amount , the positive or hole charge predominantly residing on carbon atoms while the spin , on nitrogen atoms .",
    "the @xmath5 atoms being more electronegative than the @xmath122 atoms ( @xmath55 = @xmath202.96 ev , @xmath54 = 0.0 ev ) , prefer being electron rich by accommodating more charge density . however , due to large on - site coulomb repulsion ( @xmath53 = 12.34 ev ) , the average site charge on @xmath5 atoms is slightly larger than 1.0 which is observed from the charge density distribution in the neutral ground state and the initial state . on the other hand , due to @xmath52 = 11.26 ev and @xmath54 = 0.0 ,",
    "the carbon atoms are slightly electron deficient in the @xmath112 system .",
    "thus , propagation of the charge and spin degrees of freedom of the hole in this polarized background results in formation of the `` quasi - static '' state , which once formed , prevents both the charge and spin from returning to the site of injection as it requires reversal of polarization and is hence , energetically unfavorable .    in unsubstituted pmi chains , @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    "are 1.75 fs and 3.65 fs for @xmath5 = 30 , and 2.01 fs and 6.60 fs for @xmath5 = 40 .",
    "we find that the @xmath123 ratios for the @xmath5 = 30 is 2.08 and for @xmath5 = 40 , 3.29 .",
    "the @xmath123 ratio for a pmi chain of 30 sites agrees well with that of push - pull polyene with @xmath5 = 30 ( @xmath31 = 0 ) .",
    "however , this ratio for @xmath5 = 40 ( @xmath31 = 0 ) is much higher in the pmi chain compared to push - pull polyene of same size .",
    "this is opposite to the behavior exhibited by push - pull polyenes , where the @xmath123 ratio decreases with increasing chain length . in both polyenes and polymethine imines ,",
    "the @xmath123 ratios do not saturate , indicating that the @xmath3-coherence lengths for transport are rather long .",
    "it also appears that alternate donor - acceptor sites along the chain enhance the velocities of both charge and spin .",
    "we have also studied substituents at the terminal sites in the @xmath112 systems and as with the polyenes , the strength of the push - pull groups do not affect the charge and spin velocities , or the nature of the `` quasi - static '' state .",
    "to conclude , our studies show that the velocities of charge and spin transport are not affected by push - pull substituents , although the magnitude of charge transport depends on the push - pull strength . in the related @xmath112 system",
    "we find that , due to the underlying polarized structure both the spin and charge transport are affected , and charge travels much faster than spin compared to push - pull systems .",
    "furthermore , the transport of charge and spin results in the formation of a `` quasi - static '' state in which the injected hole resides in both halves of the system , almost in equal amount .",
    "we also note that in the pmis the finite size effects are very large compared to the push - pull polyenes , suggesting much longer @xmath3-coherence lengths .",

    "<S> in this paper we investigate the effect of terminal substituents on the dynamics of spin and charge transport in donor - acceptor substituted polyenes ( @xmath0 ) chains , also known as push - pull polyenes . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a long - range correlated model hamiltonian for the @xmath0 system , and time - dependent density matrix renormalization group technique for time propagating the wave packet obtained by injecting a hole at a terminal site , in the ground state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> our studies reveal that the end groups do not affect spin and charge velocities in any significant way , but change the amount of charge transported . </S>",
    "<S> we have compared these push - pull systems with donor - acceptor substituted polymethine imine ( pmi ) , @xmath1 , systems in which besides electron affinities , the nature of @xmath2 orbitals in conjugation also alternate from site to site . </S>",
    "<S> we note that spin and charge dynamics in the pmis are very different from that observed in the case of push - pull polyenes , and within the time scale of our studies , transport of spin and charge leads to the formation of a `` quasi - static '' state . </S>"
