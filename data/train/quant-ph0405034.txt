    "considerable attention has been paid to the ability of intense laser fields to align or orient polar molecules ; in such fields , the molecules experience torque arising from the dipolar interaction with electric fields @xcite .",
    "one approach to achieve adiabatic molecular alignment is to use a nanosecond - pulse laser @xcite . while adiabatic alignment disappears after the pulse is turned off , ultrashort pulses ( 100 fs or less ) can excite rotational wave packets of quantum rotors , thus yielding a noticeably aligned shape after the pulse is off @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a specially designed sequence of pulses is known to achieve an enhanced angular focusing in quantum rotors @xcite ; this has been realized experimentally in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "these types of alignment , which differ from the adiabatic , are important for manifold applications requiring transient molecular alignment under field - free conditions , such as the generation of laser pulses @xcite and the control of high harmonic generation as a source of coherent radiation @xcite .    in most studies of the molecular alignment , dipolar interaction between polar molecules has been neglected . in this case ,",
    "the rotational dynamics of polar molecules can be simply analyzed by using an isolated kicked - rotor model @xcite .",
    "the quantum kicked rotor and its classical analog have long served as a paradigm for quantum and classical chaos . in contrast , the quantum dynamics of _ interacting _ kicked rotors has been less well studied so far , though intriguing phenomena of interacting quantum rotors are expected to emerge .",
    "very recently , a study of the center - of - mass motion in two coupled kicked rotors has revealed that the decoherence effect induced by the internal degree of freedom enhances the quantum - classical correspondence in the dynamics of rotors @xcite .",
    "in addition , anomalous dielectric responses have been pointed out in two coupled dipolar rotors @xcite .",
    "these results imply that coupled kicked rotors , even in _ only two _ rotors , exhibit peculiar behaviors different from those of isolated kicked rotors .    in the present work , we theoretically investigate the quantum dynamics of coupled ( paired ) kicked rotors subject to an ultrashort laser pulse ( @xmath0-function kick ) .",
    "we find that the dipolar interaction between rotors remarkably enhances the transient orientation of paired rotors produced by a @xmath0-kick .",

    "we see that the increase in @xmath97 inevitably raises the minimal value of @xmath56 in both arrangements ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that , in _ classical _ systems , the strong dipolar interaction interferes with the orientation of paired rotors for both arrangements ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the physical interpretation is given as follows .",
    "when two dipolar rotors are assigned in arrangement ( a ) , strong dipolar interaction forces them to be parallel in the direction normal to the field direction ( see fig .  1 ) .",

    "the dipolar interaction in _ classical _ systems certainly prevents the rotors from becoming oriented in the field direction defined in fig .  1 .",
    "these facts naturally lead us to the following question : why is it that a strong dipolar interaction can enhance the orientation of rotors in _ quantum _ systems ( see fig .  2 ( a ) ) ? comparing the behavior of @xmath56 shown in fig .  3 ( a ) with that shown in the right of fig .  2 ( a ) , we clearly see that the effect of dipolar interaction on the orientation of paired rotors differs completely between classical and quantum systems . to settle this point",

    "the degree of angular focusing for the rainbow structure is obviously inferior to that for the case of strongly interacting rotors ( fig .",
    "4 ( ii ) ) . in summary ,",
    "two factors are essential for enhancing the orientation of paired rotors : i ) the initial state before the kick consists of two wave packets strongly confined at symmetric positions with respect to the origin , ii ) these wave packets move translationally toward the origin after the kick . it should be mentioned that the translational motion of two wave packets after a @xmath0-pulse is not trivial .",
    "we can analytically trace the motion of those wave packets by calculating the expansion coefficients @xmath108 appearing in appendix b. details of the calculations will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the spatial profile of the initial eigenstate is determined by the potential term @xmath5 . for arrangement ( a ) , the potential @xmath5 as a function of @xmath67 and @xmath68 gives two potential minima , at @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and a maximum at @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "the energy difference between the minimum and the maximum is determined by the interaction energy @xmath19 or , equivalently , the parameter @xmath69 .",
    "when @xmath57 is much larger than unity , the energy difference becomes so large that the initial eigenstate is strongly localized at the two potential minima , as shown in fig .",
    "in addition , the amplitude of the wavefunction at the origin becomes almost zero due to the large potential maximum . for post - kicked time",
    ", however , the kick creates a large number of excited states , so that a superposition of them can produce a transient angular focusing at the potential maximum @xmath109 .",

    ", the orientation of paired rotors in the field direction @xmath109 can not occur when the energy difference between the minimum and the maximum is larger than the kinetic energy of the rotors immediately after the kick .",
    "in other words , the strong dipolar interaction prevents the paired - rotor state from being located at the origin @xmath109 .",
