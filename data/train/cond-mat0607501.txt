    "the desire to extend these studies to other models in this general class is immediate .",
    "there is particular interest in the community to find other examples of non - trivial bulk quantum phases , and possibly to relate existing ones to more realistic models of cold atoms trapped in optical lattices .",
    "the inclusion of further - neighbor interactions in the bose hubbard hamiltonian is extremely important for efforts@xcite that attempt to use it to model a dilute gas of atoms with dipolar interactions ( such as @xmath3cr ) @xcite in a periodic potential .",

    "this supersolid phase can be viewed as arising from an order - by - disorder mechanism , where an extensive degeneracy of the classical ground states of the interacting part of the hamiltonian is lifted by quantum fluctuations ( hopping).@xcite the extensively - degenerate manifold consists of spin configurations that allows for each triangular lattice plaquette to be minimally frustrated ( one spin up and two spins down , or vice versa ) . in the supersolid phase ,",
    "these configurations obtain diagonal long - range order when perturbed by @xmath24 .",
    "alternatively , the supersolid state may be viewed as resulting from doping the 1/3 or 2/3 ( boson density ) filled mott phases that occur at @xmath31 with additional superfluid bosons .",

    ", width=201 ]    to gain insight into the types of order which may develop when large repulsive interactions ( @xmath0 and @xmath34 ) are present , we appeal to a simple calculation of the ordering wavevectors for the classical _ nn _ and _ nnn _ ising model . the `` star '' of @xmath35-points that minimize the fourier transform of the classical interaction matrix are displayed in fig .",

    "these ordering wavevectors are employed to construct diagonal order parameters using the density structure factor , as discussed in the next section .    in the presence of a moderate particle - hole symmetry - breaking chemical potential ( magnetic field ) ,",
    "the classical _ nn _ model on the triangular lattice realizes a @xmath44 ( boson density 2/3 or 1/3 ) pattern with true long - range ordered correlations at wavevectors @xmath45.@xcite the same can be expected for the three _ nnn _ sublattices if not coupled by a hopping ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "if one combines these three non - interacting _ nnn _ sublattices to form the original lattice illustrated in fig .",
    "[ nnntlatt ] , two possible global patterns result , with ordering wavevectors @xmath46 .",
    "these are the `` striped '' and `` bubble '' phases ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ stripebub ] ) , studied previously using numerical techniques by metcalf.@xcite metcalf demonstrated that both phases are stable , energetically equivalent ground - state configurations of the classical _ nnn _ model in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we therefore can ask whether either of these ordered ( or insulating ) patterns survive in the system upon inclusion of the _ nn _ hopping @xmath24 .",
    "if so , then the possibility of accessing the associated superfluid - insulating quantum phase transition ( say upon tuning @xmath24 ) is of exceptional interest .",
    "this phase transition was studied by burkov and balents@xcite using a phenomenological field theory of vortices interacting on the dual ( honeycomb ) lattice , with the goal of understanding universal phenomena in the vicinity of various superfluid - mott quantum critical points in microscopic models with the same spatial symmetries .",
    "the simplest dvt analysis for the case of 1/3 ( or 2/3 ) boson filling contains three unique mott insulating states .",
    "two of these mott phases are the striped and bubble states , and are conjectured to be connected by a deconfined quantum critical point ( dqcp ) to the neighboring superfluid state .",
    "a dqcp is the recently proposed bon ton of unconventional quantum criticality , not based on the standard lgw concept of the order parameter.@xcite rather , such dqcps are described in terms of _ emergent _ degrees of freedom not related to the microscopic symmetries of the adjoining phases , and emergent topological order . however , since no clear examples of a dqcp have been identified in microscopic models or real materials , the discovery of the relevant superfluid - insulating quantum phase transition in our model would offer the unique opportunity to search for this exotic phenomenon guided by predictions of the same phenomenological field theory from which it was originally proposed.@xcite in section  [ sfmottpt ] we report qmc evidence for the existence of the striped and bubble phases in the @xmath47 model and study in detail the relevant superfluid - insulating phase transition .",
    "in an effort to elucidate the phase diagram of the model and study the physical questions mentioned above , we employ extensive numerical simulations in this work , using the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) quantum monte carlo method pioneered by sandvik.@xcite the triangular lattice with next - nearest neighbor interactions is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ nnntlatt ] . here , the _ nnn _ diagonal interactions form three decoupled triangular sublattices , which are coupled by the _ nn _ hopping term . on frustrated lattices such as this , the qmc is free from the sign problem only for positive ( ferromagnetic ) @xmath24 .",
    "the sign of @xmath0 or @xmath1 is not relevant in this regard , however as observed in studies on other frustrated lattices , simulation efficiency is severely affected by large repulsive interactions .",
    "such problems arise due to the difficulty of tunneling between the classically degenerate manifold of minimally - frustrated states ; in classical simulations of such systems , non - local cluster or loop moves are often employed in a monte carlo .",
    "however for this type of finite - temperature qmc , the analogous cluster moves are highly non - trivial to implement .    one significant algorithmic advance , which combats the tendency of the sse directed loop algorithm to freeze ( for large @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) is to employ six - leg vertices representing triangular lattice plaquettes instead of 4-leg lattice bonds in the formulation of the directed loop algorithm.@xcite in the traditional sse formulation,@xcite the hamiltonian is decomposed into a list of two - site bond operators , which are sampled using diagonal and off - diagonal updates in a monte carlo procedure . the off - diagonal update typically employed is an operator loop algorithm called the `` directed loop '' update : closed loops are constructed in the @xmath48 simulation cell according to transition weights determined by the partition function .",
    "after being built , bosons on these closed loops are added or removed with probability @xmath49 .",
    "a difficulty in this traditional bond algorithm occurs for certain parameters , particularly in the large @xmath0 or @xmath1 regime of the phase diagram ( the frustrated near - degenerate manifold with small hopping ) . as described in ref .",
    ", when the loop under construction encounters a frustrated bond with some diagonal operator , the non - zero transition weight associated with adding or removing a single boson ( resulting in the sampling of another diagonal operator ) is suppressed due to the repulsive interactions .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by a removal of the `` local '' energy barrier directly associated with this suppression of transition weight .",
    "to do so , one may consider a decomposition of the hamiltonian into a list of three - site triangular plaquettes .",
    "the plaquette algorithm can be expected to increase the efficiency of the directed - loop updates ; movement between different minimally - frustrated plaquettes are no longer suppressed because both the initial and final configurations of the plaquette have the same ( or similar ) transfer weights .",
    "the result is a removal of an energy barrier directly associated with traversing local configurations in the near - degenerate frustrated manifold for states located in the large @xmath0 or @xmath1 regime of the phase diagram , and a significant improvement in efficiency for the algorithm.@xcite    we employ the triangular plaquette version of the sse algorithm for both _ nn _ and _ nnn _ hamiltonian terms . as discussed below , we nonetheless observe `` freezing '' of the qmc dynamics for @xmath50 , due to the persistence of `` global '' energy barriers associated with the near - degeneracy of the entire minimally - frustrated manifold and not alleviated by the above algorithmic advances . this freezing problem could be further reduced for larger @xmath0 or @xmath1 by employing more advanced simulations techniques , such as parallel tempering;@xcite however , we find that the essential physics is captured for the parameter range accessible in this simulation scheme , so we leave such improvements for future studies .    the standard estimator for the superfluid density of the model is the stiffness,@xcite defined via the free energy response to a twist @xmath51 in the boundary conditions and measured with winding number fluctuations@xcite in each of the lattice translation vector directions , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the inverse temperature . typically the stiffness is averaged over both @xmath27 and @xmath28 directions ( see fig .",
    "[ nnntlatt ] ) so that we define @xmath54 , unless measured in a phase which breaks rotational symmetry ( we discuss this more in the next section ) .",

    "it is most easily described as a degenerate manifold of minimally - frustrated triangular plaquettes , each with only one or two bosons .",
    "it is expected that the addition of a _ nn _ hopping ( @xmath24 ) will break the classical degeneracy , although whether this perturbation produces an ordering effect on the diagonal components of the bosons is not obvious .",
    "we can address this physical question with qmc simulations , however , pragmatically , the approach of perturbing the classical @xmath1 manifold with @xmath24 is difficult due to the aforementioned severe algorithmic freezing effects in this regime .",
    "we thus employ the usual complementary approach , by applying a strengthening diagonal @xmath1 interaction to the dominant hopping regime ( we use a fixed @xmath67 corresponding to @xmath68 throughout this paper ) .",
    "this allows us to study the effects of increasing frustration while simultaneously evaluating the simulation performance in a systematic way .",

    "the preference of the model towards either state may be delicate , or vary with position on the phase diagram .",
    "nonetheless we observe that the average energy of the striped state @xmath118 ( measured in units of @xmath67 ) is slightly lower than the energy of the bubble state @xmath119 for the specific parameters discussed in fig .",
    "[ stripebub ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that a preference of the system towards the 2/3 striped state is consistent with the picture of this phase being closely connected to the adjacent _ nnn _ supersolid phase , i.e.  upon crossing the mott to supersolid phase boundary , the broken symmetry of the diagonal order parameter stays the same .",
    "the simulation parameters were @xmath96 , and @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "this value of @xmath19 was found to very closely match the filling of the superfluid right at the transition to 2/3 .",
    "the main plot illustrates the abrupt discontinuity in @xmath60 characteristic of a first - order transition .",
    "the inset shows hysteresis typical of a first - order energy level crossing .",
    "[ sfmott],width=288 ]    as discussed in section  [ landau ] , a recent dvt@xcite predicts that two specific 2/3 mott states are connected to a neighboring superfluid ( at the same filling ) by an exotic dqcp .",
    "these two mott states are the striped and bubble states , both of which are found in our qmc simulations as described above .",
    "we can easily access the superfluid - mott phase boundary by varying model parameters ( @xmath19 or @xmath1 ) in the qmc . thus , with our simulation we are in the unique position of possibly making a direct connection between the behavior of a simple microscopic model and an exotic phenomenon contained in a continuum dvt .",
    "the first step in the simulations is to study the order of the phase transition .",
    "the `` conventional '' situation in a case like this where the phases on either side of the phase transition have unrelated broken symmetries is a first - order transition ; a continuous quantum critical point would suggest a breakdown of the conventional landau picture and possible relevance to a more exotic theory like deconfined quantum criticality.@xcite    using the qmc simulation , we mapped out the phase diagram roughly near the `` tip '' of the mott lobe , in attempt to determine a set of parameters which closely matches the filling of the neighboring superfluid phase to 2/3 ( which would be required to make a comparison to the predictions of the fixed - filling dvt ) .",
    "we then performed more detailed simulations , keeping the chemical potential fixed and sweeping the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sfmott ] .",
    "these simulations , even though carried out on a relative small lattice ( @xmath122 ) , display a discontinuity in the value of @xmath60 and hysteresis effects in other observables  behavior that is prototypical of a first - order phase transition . in fact , the superfluid - mott phase transition appears `` strongly '' first - order , e.g. the discontinuity in @xmath60 is clear and obvious .",
    "this result precludes an interpretation of the transition as a quantum critical point that should share universal properties with a dqcp , and instead suggests the much more conventional lgw paradigm as the correct descriptor of the transition .",
    "in this paper we have presented qmc simulation results for the ground state phase diagram of the bose hubbard model with _",
    "nn _ hopping and _ nnn _ repulsive interactions . at 1/2-filling",
    ", the phase diagram contains a superfluid phase ( for dominant hopping ( @xmath24 ) ) , two supersolid phases ( for dominant @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively ) , and a period - two striped mott insulating state for large @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the superfluid- and supersolid - to - mott phase boundaries are observed to be strongly first - order .",
    "the large-@xmath1 supersolid phase is characterized by the homogeneous coexistence of diagonal ( solid ) and off - diagonal ( superfluid ) long range order in the system .",
    "density correlations in this phase are observed to have the symmetry of a period - three striped state , similar to that observed in an adjacent 1/3-filled striped mott insulator , although the density of the supersolid is measured to be firmly at 1/2-filling ( for @xmath25 ) .",
    "this fact leads to the immediate interpretation of the supersolid state as a 1/3 mott insulator which is doped with interstitial bosons that become delocalized , forming the `` superfluid '' component .",
    "this picture is clearly an over - simplification , however , since as a result one would expect the boson superflow to occur in one - dimensional channels between the strongly - localized density stripes . indeed",
    "the resulting anisotropy in the superfluid density is measured , although it is extremely small ( @xmath123 ) , especially when compared to other striped supersolid states observed on square - lattice bose hubbard models doped away from 1/2-filling.@xcite this issue might be answered by looking at correlations further away from the superfluid - supersolid quantum critical point , or examining other estimators that would be expected to harbor a complementary anisotropy in such a state . since it is also possible that the doped - mott insulator interpretation simply ceases to be valid at densities this far from 1/3 or 2/3 , additional measurements of the @xmath60 anisotropy away from 1/2 filling would help shed light on the issue .",
    "the resolution of such paradoxes in a simple model like this could have broad implications for studies of nanoscale density inhomogeneities in other bulk quantum phases , for example in `` stripe '' mechanisms of high-@xmath124 superconductivity in the cuprates .",
    "the 1/3-filled striped mott insulating state exists on the @xmath2 phase diagram for large @xmath1 , in the presence of a chemical potential that breaks particle - hole symmetry .",
    "in addition to being adjacent to the striped supersolid phase , this phase borders on a uniform superfluid phase that dominates at larger hopping @xmath24 . this phase boundary offers a unique opportunity to search for an example of exotic non - lgw quantum criticality suggested by a recent phenomenological dvt.@xcite however , in this model , the relevant superfluid - mott phase transition is observed to be strongly first - order .",
    "thus an example of a highly sought deconfined quantum critical point@xcite is not present .",
    "although it is true that the dvt is a phenomenological theory and does not predict the order of a phase transition for any specific microscopic model , it is perhaps unfortunate that the expected universal properties of the vortex theory are not realized in a simple model such as this .    on the other hand , the result that the relevant superfluid - mott phase transition is _ strongly",
    "_ first order is an important contrast to other phase transitions previously studied as candidates for dqcps . in particular",
    ", simulations of superfluid - vbs phase transitions@xcite which at first appear to be continuous ( for example because of the lack of obvious discontinuities in the data ) may indeed turn out to be very `` weakly '' first - order upon closer scrutiny of more subtle indicators , such as values of critical exponents or interpretations of finite - size behavior on extremely large lattices .",
    "in contrast to these previous simulations that involved transitions into the vbs phase , our present candidate transition only requires the presence of a simple density - modulated mott insulator .",
    "comparing the numerical signatures between these cases may help develop a more systematic method for identifying weakly - first order phase transitions in quantum simulations , which could contribute to the resolution of fundamental controversies@xcite surrounding the very existence of dqcps in these and related systems .",
