    "over the last decades , matter under extreme conditions of density and temperature has been the subject of study in order to address fundamental aspects of the strong interaction .",
    "this study is intimately linked to several experimental programs , such as sis / gsi , rhic / bnl , lhc / cern project and the forthcoming panda and cbm experiments at fair . in this context , the properties of hadrons with strange and charm content in hot and dense matter are of particular interest . whereas the properties of mesons with strangeness in dense matter have been analyzed in connection to the study of exotic atoms as well as the analysis of heavy - ion collisions , the properties of mesons with charm are under scrutiny and will play an important role at fair .    in this talk",
    "we review different approaches to obtain the in - medium properties of the strange and open - charm mesons in nuclear matter and nuclei , paying a special attention to coupled - channels unitarized methods .",
    "several experimental scenarios are analyzed , such as heavy - ion collision data on strange pseudoscalar mesons , the photoproduction of strange vector mesons , the formation of @xmath0-mesic nuclei and the @xmath0-meson propagation from rhic to fair energies .",
    "early works based on relativistic mean - field calculations @xcite obtained very deep potentials of a few hundreds of mevs at saturation density @xmath2 for @xmath1 in matter , in line with the analysis of data on antikaonic atoms using phenomenological models @xcite . however , antikaonic - atom data tests matter at the surface of the nucleus and , therefore , do not really provide a suitable constraint on the antikaon - nucleus potential at saturation density .    later approaches on unitarized theories in coupled channels based on the chiral approach @xcite or on meson - exchange potentials",
    "@xcite obtain a much less attractive potential . in these schemes ,",
    "the attraction is a consequence of the modified @xmath3-wave @xmath4 resonance in the medium due to pauli blocking @xcite together with the self - consistent consideration of the @xmath1 self - energy @xcite and the inclusion of self - energies of the mesons and baryons in the intermediate states @xcite .",
    "attraction of the order of -50 mev at normal nuclear matter density is then reached @xcite .",
    "moreover , higher - partial waves beyond @xmath3-wave @xcite become essential for relativistic heavy - ion experiments at beam energies below 2  gev per nucleon .",
    "one of the latest unitarized approaches for calculating the @xmath1 self - energy in symmetric nuclear matter at finite temperature is that of refs .  @xcite . in this model , the @xmath1 self - energy and , hence",
    ", the spectral function are obtained from the in - medium @xmath1-nucleon interaction in @xmath5 and @xmath6waves within a chiral unitary approach .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath7 spectral function with density and temperature is shown in the l.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ fig : spec - trans ] , defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the @xmath1 self - energy .",
    "the @xmath1 spectral function shows a broad peak that results from a strong mixing between the quasi - particle peak and the @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath12-wave excitations .",
    "temperature and density soften the @xmath12-wave contributions to the spectral function at the quasi - particle energy .    from heavy - ion collisions",
    "there has been a lot of activity aiming at extracting the properties of @xmath1 in a dense and hot environment @xcite .",
    "initial studies have addressed the @xmath1 production in nucleus - nucleus collisions at sis energies using a transport model with @xmath1 that were dressed with the juelich meson - exchange model @xcite or analyzing multiplicity ratios @xcite .",
    "however , the question that still remains is to what extend the properties of @xmath1 mesons are modified in matter .      with regard to strange vector mesons in the nuclear medium",
    ", very little discussion has been made about their properties .",
    "recently , the @xmath13 self - energy in symmetric nuclear matter has been obtained within the hidden gauge formalism of ref .",
    "two sources for the modification of the @xmath13 @xmath3-wave self - energy emerged in nuclear matter : one associated to the decay mode @xmath14 modified by nuclear medium effects on the @xmath15 and @xmath1 mesons ( which accounts for the @xmath16 processes , with @xmath17 ) ; and a second one linked to the interaction of the @xmath13 with the nucleons in the medium ( which accounts for the direct quasi - elastic process @xmath18 , as well as other absorption channels involving vector mesons and baryons , @xmath19 ) , coming from a unitarized coupled - channel calculation .",
    "two resonances are generated dynamically , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which can be identified with the experimentally observed states @xmath22 @xmath23 and the @xmath22 pdg state @xmath24 , respectively @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : spec ] ) and is displayed in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spec - trans ] as a function of the meson energy @xmath25 , for zero momentum and different densities up to 1.5 @xmath2 .",
    "the dashed line refers to the calculation in free space , where only the @xmath14 decay channel contributes , while the other three lines correspond to the self - consistent calculations , which incorporate the process @xmath26 in the medium , as well as the quasielastic @xmath18 and other @xmath27 processes .",
    "the structures above the quasiparticle peak correspond to the dynamically generated @xmath28 and @xmath29 excitations .",
    "density effects result in a dilution and merging of those resonant - hole states , together with a broadening of the spectral function due to the increase of collisional and absorption processes .",
    "what is clear from the present approach , is that the spectral function spread of the @xmath13 increases substantially in the medium , becoming at normal nuclear matter density five times bigger than in free space .    in order to test the @xmath13 self - energy experimentally ,",
    "we analyze the normalized nuclear transparency ratio , defined as @xmath30 it describes the loss of flux of @xmath31 mesons in the nucleus and is related to the absorptive part of the @xmath31-nucleus optical potential and , thus , to the @xmath31 width in matter .",
    "we evaluate the ratio between the nuclear cross sections in heavy nuclei and a light one ( @xmath32c ) , @xmath33 , so that other nuclear effects not related to the absorption of the @xmath31 cancel . in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : spec - trans ] we observe a very strong attenuation of the @xmath34 survival probability due to the decay @xmath35 or absorption channels @xmath36 with increasing nuclear - mass number @xmath37 .",
    "this is due to the larger path that the @xmath34 has to follow before it leaves the nucleus , having then more chances to decay or get absorbed .",
    "the medium modifications of mesons with charm , such as @xmath0 and @xmath38 mesons , have been object of recent theoretical interest due to the consequences for charmonium suppression . a phenomenological estimate based on the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model",
    "predicts an attractive @xmath39-nucleus potential at @xmath2 of @xmath40 -140 mev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-meson mass shift has also been studied using the qcd sum - rule ( qsr ) approach @xcite , where a mass shift of -50 mev at @xmath2 for the @xmath0-meson has been suggested @xcite .",
    "recent results on qsr rules for open charm mesons can be found in @xcite .",
    "the mass modification of the @xmath0-meson is also addressed using a chiral effective model in hot and dense matter @xcite , where strong mass shifts were obtained .    with regard to approaches based on coupled - channel dynamics ,",
    "unitarized methods have been applied in the meson - baryon sector with charm content @xcite , partially motivated by the parallelism between the @xmath4 and the @xmath41 .",
    "more recently , the implementation of heavy - quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) has been considered , which is a proper qcd symmetry that appears when the quark masses , such as the charm mass , become larger than the typical confinement scale .",
    "the model generates dynamically resonances with negative parity in all the isospin , spin , strange and charm sectors that one can form from an @xmath3-wave interaction between pseudoscalar and vector meson multiplets with @xmath42 and @xmath43 baryons @xcite . within this model , the self - energies and , hence",
    ", spectral functions for @xmath0 and @xmath44 mesons are obtained self - consistently in a simultaneous manner , as it follows from hqss , by taking , as bare interaction , an appropiately extended wt interaction @xcite .",
    "we incorporate pauli blocking effects and open charm meson self - energies in the intermediate propagators for the in - medium solution @xcite .",
    "the detection of the in - medium properties of open charm mesons in matter can be addressed , for example , in the possible formation of @xmath0 mesic nuclei .",
    "the qmc model predicted @xmath0 and @xmath38-meson bound states in @xmath45pb relying upon an attractive @xmath0 and @xmath38 -meson potential in the nuclear medium @xcite . within the model that respects hqss",
    ", we obtain that for @xmath38-mesic nuclei @xcite , not only @xmath46 ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) ) but also @xmath47 is bound in nuclei .",
    "the spectrum contains states of atomic and of nuclear types for all nuclei for @xmath46 while only nuclear states are present for @xmath47 in nuclei .",
    "compared to the pure coulomb levels , the atomic states are less bound .",
    "the nuclear ones are more bound and may present a sizable width .",
    "moreover , nuclear states only exist for low angular momenta . in what respects to @xmath0 mesons @xcite ,",
    "@xmath48-nucleus states are weakly bound in contrast to previous results using the qmc model . moreover ,",
    "those states have significant widths , in particular , for @xmath45pb .",
    "only @xmath48-nucleus bound states are possible since the coulomb interaction prevents the formation of observable bound states for @xmath39 mesons .",
    "the experimental detection of @xmath0 bound states is , however , a difficult task @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the study of transport coefficients for a @xmath0 meson in a hot dense medium composed of light mesons and baryons , such as it is formed in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "one interesting observable is the spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath49 around the phase transition from rhic to fair energies @xcite ( see fig .",
