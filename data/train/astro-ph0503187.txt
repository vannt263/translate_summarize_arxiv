    "rotational instabilities are potentially important in the evolution of newly - formed proto - neutron stars ( proto - nss ) . in particular , immediately following the pre - supernova collapse  and accompanying rapid spin up  of the iron core of a massive star , nonaxisymmetric instabilities may be effective at redistributing angular momentum within the core . by transferring angular momentum out of the centermost region of the core",
    ", nonaxisymmetric instabilities could help explain why the spin periods of newly formed pulsars are longer than what one would expect from standard stellar evolutionary calculations that do not invoke magnetic field action for angular momentum redistribution and generation of very slowly rotating cores ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , in situations where the initial collapse `` fizzles '' and the proto - ns is hung up by centrifugal forces in a configuration below nuclear density , a rapid redistribution of angular momentum would facilitate the final collapse to ns densities .",
    "the time - varying mass multipole moments resulting from nonaxisymmetric instabilities in proto - nss may also produce gw signals that are detectable by the burgeoning , international array of gw interferometers .",
    "the analysis of such signals would provide us with the unprecedented ability to directly monitor the formation of nss and , perhaps , black holes .    in this letter , we present results from numerical simulations that show the spontaneous development of a spiral - shaped instability during the postbounce phase of the evolution of a newly formed proto - ns .",
    "these are the most realistic such simulations performed , to date , because the pre - collapse iron core has been drawn from the central region of a realistically evolved 20 m@xmath0star , and the collapse of the core as well as the postbounce evolution has been modeled in a dynamically self - consistent manner . starting from somewhat simpler initial states ,",
    "other groups have followed the development of bar - like structure in postbounce cores using newtonian @xcite and relativistic @xcite gravity , but their analyses have been limited to cores having a high ratio of rotational to gravitational potential energy , @xmath4 .",
    "we demonstrate that a one - armed spiral ( not the traditional bar - like ) instability can develop in a proto - ns even if it has a relatively low @xmath3 .",
    "this is significant , but perhaps not surprising given the recent studies by @xcite , shibata et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) , and @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this letter are drawn from three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that follow approximately @xmath5 of the `` postbounce '' evolution of a newly forming proto - ns . before presenting the details of these simulations , however , it is important to emphasize the broader evolutionary context within which they have been conducted and , specifically , from what source(s ) the initial conditions for the simulations have been drawn .",
    "the two simulations presented here cover the final portion ( stage 3 ) of a much longer , three - part evolution that also included : ( stage 1 ) the main - sequence and post - main - sequence evolution of a spherically symmetric , 20 m@xmath0 star through the formation of an iron core that is dynamically unstable toward collapse ; and ( stage 2 ) the axisymmetric collapse of this unstable iron core through the evolutionary phase at which `` bounces '' at nuclear densities .",
    "stage 1 of the complete evolution was originally presented as model `` @xmath6 '' by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) .",
    "the initial configuration for this model was a chemically homogeneous , spherically symmetric , zero - age main - sequence star with solar metallicities .",
    "evolution up to the development of an unstable iron core took some @xmath7 of physical time . in stage 2 the spherically symmetric model from stage 1 was mapped onto the two - dimensional , axisymmetric grid of the hydrodynamics code `` vulcan/2d '' ( livne 1993 ) and evolved as model `` @xmath8 '' by ott et al .",
    "rotation was introduced into the core with a radial angular velocity profile @xmath9^{-1}$ ] ( where @xmath10 is the cylindrical radius ) .",
    "the scale length in the initial rotation law was set to @xmath11 and @xmath12 was chosen so that , initially , @xmath13 .",
    "the axisymmetric collapse was modelled adiabatically but the full lattimer  swesty equation of state ( lseos ; lattimer & swesty 1991 ) was incorporated .    during stage 2 ,",
    "the innermost region of the unstable iron core collapsed homologously and , in @xmath14 , reached nuclear densities . as a consequence of angular momentum conservation , the core spun up considerably ; at the time of the bounce , the rotational energy parameter had increased to @xmath15 . as a result , the core bounce was aided as much by increased centrifugal forces as it was by the rapidly stiffening equation of state at nuclear densities . after bounce ,",
    "the core expanded coherently , leading to almost an order - of - magnitude drop in the maximum density .",
    "this expansion was then reversed when gravitational forces again began to dominate over pressure gradients and centrifugal forces . in this way ,",
    "the rapidly spinning , postbounce core underwent several damped - harmonic - oscillator like cycles .",

    "( 2004 ) followed the axisymmetric evolution of model @xmath8 for @xmath16 140 ms after the time of its initial bounce , @xmath17 .    in order to study the possible development of nonaxisymmetric structure in a newly forming proto - ns",
    ", we mapped the vulcan/2d model into the fully three - dimensional hydrodynamic code flow@xmath18er ( @xcite ; stage 3 ) . in this work , we have adopted an ideal - fluid eos : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the mass density , @xmath21 is the pressure , @xmath22 is the chosen adiabatic exponent , and @xmath23 is the specific internal energy . for sub - nuclear density matter  specifically , for @xmath24  @xmath22 is set to 1.325 , which approximates the @xmath22 given by the lseos in vulcan/2d in the sub - nuclear density regime and the given conditions . for @xmath25 , we have set @xmath26 to mimic the effects of nuclear repulsive forces .",

    "model @xmath8 was mapped onto flow@xmath18er s grid at two different times during its postbounce evolution : model `` * q15 * '' was evolved on a grid with @xmath28 zones in @xmath29 and mapped at t - t@xmath30 = 15 ms when the core was in the middle of its second postbounce expansion phase . upon introduction into the three - dimensional code , its density field",

    ", width=307 ]    .3 cm    because nonaxisymmetric perturbations were initially introduced into both models at a very low amplitude , the early phase of both evolutions resembled the axisymmetric evolution reported in ott et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . here ,",
    "this is illustrated best by the oscillations in @xmath44 and @xmath45 that are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes_hr ] for model * w5 * ; the characteristic ( dynamical ) time between successive `` radial '' bounces is @xmath46 ( consistent with a mean core density @xmath47 ) and the axisymmetric oscillations persist for @xmath48 .",
    "the curves of @xmath49 for model * w5 * also signal that the dynamics is essentially axisymmetric : as viewed along the @xmath40-axis , the gw strain exhibits oscillations of diminishing amplitude , as reported in ott et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , but for the first @xmath50 after @xmath17 , essentially no gw radiation is emitted along the @xmath39-axis . in model * q15 * , fewer `` radial '' bounces occur , they damp out somewhat more rapidly , and the resulting @xmath49 signal is weaker as viewed along the @xmath40-axis .",
    "this is , in part , because the postbounce core configuration was introduced into flow@xmath18er at a later time ( @xmath51 for model * q15 * instead of @xmath52 for model * w5 * ) and , in part , because the effects of numerical damping are inevitably more apparent when a simulation is run on a grid having lower spatial resolution .",
    "as is illustrated by the solid @xmath49 curves in the bottom panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : modes_lr ] and [ fig : modes_hr ] , at early times the amplitude of the gravitational radiation that would be emitted along the @xmath39-axis is larger in model * q15 * than in model * w5*. this reflects the fact that the nonaxisymmetric perturbation that was initially introduced into model * q15 * was larger and it had an entirely @xmath32 character .",
    "although in model * q15 * the postbounce core was subjected to a pure , @xmath32 bar - mode perturbation when it was mapped onto the flow@xmath18er grid , the amplitude of the model s mass - quadrupole distortion did not grow perceptibly during the first @xmath53 ( @xmath54 dynamical times ) of the model s evolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : modes_lr ] ) .",
    "however , as the solid curve in the same figure panel shows , the model spontaneously developed an @xmath2 `` dipole '' distortion even though the initial density perturbation did not contain any @xmath2 contribution .",
    "as early as @xmath55 , a globally coherent @xmath2 mode appeared out of the noise and grew exponentially on a timescale @xmath56 . at @xmath57 ,",
    "the amplitude of this @xmath2 distortion surpassed the amplitude of the languishing @xmath32 structure and , shortly thereafter , it became nonlinear . at @xmath58",
    ", the quadrupole distortion also began to amplify , but it appears to have only been following the exponential development of the @xmath2 mode .",
    "an analysis of the oscillation frequency of both modes reveals them to be harmonics of one another . as the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : modes_hr ] illustrates , the same @xmath2 mode developed spontaneously out of the @xmath59 amplitude , random perturbation that was introduced into model * w5*. the mode reached a nonlinear amplitude somewhat earlier in model * w5 * than in model * q15 * , presumably because the initially imposed random perturbation included a finite - size contribution to an @xmath2 distortion whereas the density perturbation introduced into model * q15 * contained no @xmath2 component .",
    "the growth timescale of the instability is @xmath60 for model * w5*. although we have described the unstable @xmath2 mode as a `` dipole '' mass distortion , this is somewhat misleading because in neither model did the lopsided mass distribution produce a shift in the location of the center of mass of the system .",
    "instead , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : denvel ] , the mode developed as a tightly wound , one - armed spiral , very similar to the @xmath2  -  dominated structures that have been reported by @xcite and @xcite .    .",
    "left : two - dimensional isodensity contours with velocity vectors superposed ; contour levels are ( from the innermost , outward ) @xmath610.15,0.01,0.001,0.0001 .",
    "right : spiral character of the @xmath2 distortion as determined by a fourier analysis of the density distribution ; specifically , the phase angle @xmath62 of the @xmath2 fourier mode is drawn as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "[ fig : denvel],width=307 ]     ( top frame ) and the mass density @xmath63 ( bottom frame ) are shown at four different times during the evolution of model * w5*. changes in these profiles at late times illustrate the effects of angular momentum redistribution by the @xmath2 spiral mode : angular momentum migrates radially outward while mass migrates radially inward .",
    "a horizontal line drawn in the top panel at @xmath64 identifies the corotation radius for this one - armed spiral mode .",
    "the `` kink '' seen in @xmath63 at late times at about 8 km is connected to the discontinous switch of the eos @xmath22 at @xmath65.[fig : vphi2],width=307 ]    after the spiral pattern reached its maximum amplitude in both of our model evolutions , the maximum density began to slowly increase and @xmath35 started decreasing ( figs . 1 & 2 ) .",
    "following @xcite , we interpret this behavior as resulting from angular momentum redistribution that is driven by the spiral - like deformation and by gravitational torques associated with it . as angular momentum",
    "is transported outward , the centrifugal support of the innermost region is reduced , a larger fraction of the core s mass is compressed to nuclear densities and , in turn , @xmath35 decreases because the magnitude of the gravitational potential energy correspondingly increases .",
    "[ fig : vphi2 ] supports this interpretation .",
    "as the proto - ns evolves , we see that the outermost layers spin faster and the innermost region becomes denser .",
    "( we note that throughout the evolution our models conserved total angular momentum to within a few parts in @xmath66 . ) also , as is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vphi2 ] , throughout most of the model s evolution there is a radius inside the proto - ns ( @xmath67 ) at which the angular velocity of the fluid matches the angular eigenfrequency ( @xmath68 ) of the spiral mode .",
    "hence , it is entirely reasonable to expect that resonances associated with this `` corotation '' region are able to effect a redistribution of angular momentum in the manner described by @xcite or @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that an off - center density maximum shows up at intermediate times , but since it is within the innermost radial grid zones , we are not sure if it is physical or an artifact due to the boundary conditions at the axis .",
    "using the 3d , newtonian , hydrodynamic code flow@xmath18er , we have modelled the postbounce phase of the evolution of an iron core from an evolved , 20  m@xmath0star . in our first simulation ( model *",
    "q15 * ) , the rotating core was mapped from two dimensions onto the three - dimensional grid at @xmath51 and the core s axisymmetric structure was altered by the introduction of a @xmath31 amplitude , barlike density perturbation .",
    "the core was found to be dynamically stable to this pure @xmath32 perturbation , but it proved to be dynamically unstable toward the spontaneous development of a tightly wound , @xmath2 spiral mode . in an effort to examine the robustness of this result , we performed a second simulation ( model * w5 * ) in which the rotating core was mapped at an earlier time ( @xmath52 ) , onto a grid with higher spatial resolution , and the core s axisymmetric structure was altered by adding a lower - amplitude ( @xmath59 ) and _ random _ density perturbation . the @xmath2 spiral mode developed spontaneously in this model as well .",
    "hence , we conclude that even relatively slowly rotating proto - nss can be susceptible to the development of a spiral - shaped , @xmath2 - dominated mass distortion .",
    "although the nonaxisymmetric distortions that developed in both our models did not grow to particularly large nonlinear amplitudes , they produced maximum gw amplitudes comparable to the `` burst '' signal produced by the preceding , axisymmetric core collapse : model * q15 * showed the highest amplitude , @xmath69 cm at a frequency f @xmath70 800 hz .",
    "the peak amplitude of the axisymmetric bounce signal reported in ott et al .",
    "( 2004 ) was @xmath71  cm at a frequency f @xmath72 hz .",
    "if the source is located within the milky way , both `` burst '' signals may be detected by the currently operative gw observatories ( ott et al .",
    "in our simulations , approximately @xmath53 separated the peaks of these two gw `` bursts , '' but the earlier peak near @xmath73 would , in practice , be unobservable if the rotation axis of the proto - ns were oriented along our line of sight , as is likely to be the case for core collapse events associated with gamma - ray bursts .",
    "our results demonstrate that a realistic , non - equilibrium postbounce stellar core can become dynamically unstable to an @xmath2 spiral instability at a value of @xmath35 as low as @xmath74 .",
    "( in model * w5 * , this corresponds to a spin period of 15 milliseconds at the surface of the proto - ns . )",
    "the value obtained in previous studies ( @xcite , @xcite ) for differentially rotating _ equilibrium models with a considerably simpler thermodynamic structure was @xmath75 .",
    "@xcite argue that the growth of the instability in their models requires a soft eos with effective @xmath22  1.4 .",
    "our models exhibit an effective @xmath22 just above this threshold while going unstable at lower @xmath35 .",
    "this difference is most probably caused by the more complicated thermodynamic and rotational structure of our models .",
    "most significantly , the instability in our low-@xmath1 models appears to be related to the proto - ns s angular velocity profile @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , unlike the classical bar - mode instability that becomes unstable above a critical value of @xmath1 , the relative stability of this spiral mode seems likely to depend on the existence or absence of a corotation resonance within the star . a wider variety of model simulations will be required to properly examine the validity of this conjecture .",
    "our simulations support the suggestion of @xcite that a spiral - mode instability can be effective at redistributing angular momentum within a proto - ns . in so doing",
    ", the instability can spin down the bulk of the core and , simultaneously , assist contraction of the innermost regions toward higher mean densities .",
    "_    the present study marks only one very early step in our understanding of rotational instabilities in proto - nss .",
    "the models we have used were purely hydrodynamic and newtonian and did not include neutrino production and radiative transfer , or any of a variety of other microphysics that is likely to be relevant to these astrophysical systems .",
    "future , fully consistent simulations including all the relevant physics will be needed to provide more definitive answers to these questions of stability .",
