    "<S> initially ( @xmath131 ) , the curvature is positive for all points ( dark brown lines ) , while at later times we observe regions of positive and negative curvature . towards the end of the simulation </S>",
    "<S> the curvature become strongly negative for all points at the right - hand side of the potential barrier .    </S>",

    "<S> the particles evolve along geodesic lines in a curved finsler manifold modelled by the quantum potential . in this framework , </S>",
    "<S> the particle - wave duality of conventional quantum mechanics is replaced by deterministic particle dynamics evolving on a curved manifold , where the curvature is derived from the _ non local _ quantum potential that depends on the position of all particles in the system ( independently from their reciprocal distance and interaction ) . </S>",
    "<S> this picture of quantum dynamics is well suited for the understanding of non locality in quantum mechanics including , for instance , the self - interference of single particles ( electrons or molecules ) on a double slit  @xcite , and the interpretation of the mach - zehnder s interferometer  @xcite , for which particle - wave duality is required according to the classical interpretation of quantum mechanics . in the first situation , the interference pattern results from the non locality of the quantum potential , @xmath143 , which entangles the single particle dynamics , @xmath144 , with the one of the device ( double slit ) . </S>",
    "<S> mach - zehnder s interference at a distance is made possible by the fact that quantum information is not just carried by the particle dynamics but also includes a component from the propagation of the configuration space curvature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation of quantum dynamics offers in addition a very simple solution to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics ; in fact , like in bohmian mechanics  @xcite , the trajectories describe deterministic paths in space and the transition to the classical world does not require the concept of wavefunction collapse . </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunction character of the quantum state and its dynamics is now confined to the characterization of the curvature of the configuration space of each constituent particle , while the system evolves along deterministic geodesic curves . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the geometrization of quantum mechanics offers a clear opportunity for the unification with einstein s theory of general relativity .      </S>",
