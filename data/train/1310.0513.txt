    "acceleration of charge particles in the universe happens on scales from planetary magnetospheres to clusters of galaxies and at energies ranging from nonrelativistic values to @xmath010@xmath1 ev ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) .",
    "the particles are observed directly as cosmic rays ( crs ) , solar energetic particles , or indirectly by their interactions with background matter and electromagnetic fields ( magnetic fields and photons ) , which give rise to heating and ionization of the plasma , and nonthermal radiation extending from long wavelength radio to @xmath0tev gamma - rays . in spite of more than a century of observations , the exact mechanism of acceleration",
    "is still being debated and the detailed model parameters are poorly constrained .",
    "clearly electric fields are involved in any acceleration mechanism .",
    "large scale electric fields have been found to be important in some unusual astrophysical sources such as magnetospheres of neutron stars ( pulsars and perhaps magnetars ) and in so - called double - layers . however , here we are interested in commonly considered mechanisms based on the original fermi process @xcite , which involves scattering of particles by fluctuating electric and magnetic fields ( or plasma turbulence ) or converging flows as in shocks .",
    "the usual approach of determining the acceleration model and its characteristics is to use the forward fitting ( ff ) method , whereby the model particle spectra based on an assumed mechanism and some parametric form of its characteristics are fitted to observations . for radiating sources ,",
    "ff is carried out in two stages , first fitting the photon spectra to an assumed radiation mechanism from a parametrized particle spectrum , then fitting the latter to the acceleration model .",
    "this approach , even though one can never be certain of the uniqueness of the results , has been fairly successful , and for some observations , e.g. , those with poorly determined spatially unresolved spectra , is the best one can do .",
    "but in sources with richer observations one can do better .",
    "in this paper we present a new approach which allows a non - parametric determination of acceleration parameters , mainly their energy dependence , irrespective of some of the details of the acceleration mechanism , directly from the observed radiation or otherwise deduced particle spectra .",
    "this is done by the _ inversion _ of the kinetic differential equations describing the particle acceleration and transport . in our first paper on this subject @xcite",
    ", we applied this technique to inversion of hard x - ray images of solar flares from the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( _ rhessi _ ) and determined the energy dependence of the escape time from the acceleration region and from it the energy dependence of the rate of scattering of the particles , presumably due to plasma turbulence , which is related to the pitch angle diffusion coefficient @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the cosine of the pitch angle . in a more recent paper @xcite",
    ", we have shown that from the same data we can also determine the energy diffusion coefficient @xmath4 , which is related to the momentum diffusion coefficient @xmath5 . in both papers we formulated this in the framework of stochastic acceleration ( sa ) by plasma waves or turbulence , which is same as the original fermi process , nowadays referred to as second - order fermi acceleration process . here",
    "we extend this approach to simultaneous determination of the scattering and acceleration rates , which depend primarily on @xmath2 and @xmath5 , to situations where both sa by turbulence and acceleration by a shock play important roles .",
    "as in previous papers we carry this out in the framework of the so called leaky box model . in the next section we present the kinetic equation describing both acceleration processes , and in  [ inv ]",
    "we describe the process of the inversion and the required data for it . in  [ sec_snr ] we describe possible application of this method to the acceleration of electrons in supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "interpretation and discussions of the results are shown in  [ sec_interp ] and a brief summary",
    "is presented in  [ sec_sum ] .",
    "the discussion below is a brief summary of this subject given in a recent review by @xcite describing the conditions under which the so - called leaky - box model is a good approximation . as emphasized in this review , and recognized by the community at large , it is clear now that plasma waves or turbulence play an essential role in the acceleration of charged particles in a variety of magnetized astrophysical and space environments .",
    "turbulence is expected to be produced by large scale flows in most astrophysical situations because of the prevailing large reynolds numbers . once generated on a scale @xmath6 comparable to the size of the source it undergoes dissipationless cascade from large to small spatial scales , or from small wave numbers",
    "@xmath7 up to the dissipation scale given by @xmath8 , generally with a power law energy density distribution @xmath9 .",
    "resonant interactions between particles and small amplitude electromagnetic fluctuations of turbulence cause diffusion of particles in the phase space . for magnetized plasmas this process can be described by the fokker - planck ( fp ) kinetic equation for gyro - phase averaged , four dimensional ( 4-d ) particle distribution function @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the distance along the magnetic field lines .",
    "this equation involves , in addition to @xmath2 and @xmath5 , a third coefficient @xmath12 , and @xmath3 and are @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the particle gyro frequency and @xmath15 is the ratio of the turbulent to total magnetic field energy densities ( see e.g. @xcite .",
    "] as well as a source term @xmath16 and energy losses or gains due to interactions of particles with background plasma ( with density @xmath17 , temperature @xmath18 , magnetic field @xmath19 and soft photon energy density @xmath20 ) .",
    "these interactions cause stochastic acceleration , e.g. , @xcite , in which particles systematically gain energy with a rate that is proportional to the square of the wave - to - particle velocity ratio as in the second - order fermi process .    also shown in @xcite",
    ", the 4-d differential equation can be reduced to a 3-d equation , when the scattering time @xmath21 is shorter than the dynamic time @xmath22 and the crossing time @xmath23 .",
    "is the particle velocity and in what follows the size @xmath6 refers to the length of the bundle of magnetic lines the particles are tied to . for chaotic fields",
    "this could be much larger than the physical size of the turbulent acceleration region .",
    "] then the momentum distribution is nearly isotropic and one can define the pitch angle averaged quantities , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and use three pitch angle - averaged transport coefficients @xmath26 ( see @xcite ) to describe spatial and momentum diffusion rates . @xcite and",
    "others , in most subsequent applications of this equation , were interested in acceleration by alfvn waves ( with velocity @xmath27 ) , in which case the diffusion coefficients are related as @xmath28 . limiting their analysis to low magnetization and high energy particles ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath29 they used the inequities @xmath30 to obtain the simplified equation .",
    "however , as was pointed out by @xcite , at low energies and for strong magnetic fields , other plasma waves become more important than the alfvn waves and these inequalities are no longer valid , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested another approximation for the fp equation for the opposite limit , @xmath31 , in which case the momentum diffusion is the dominant term .",
    "these ideas were further developed by @xcite and summarized in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that if again @xmath32 and @xmath22 , then this situation can be described by the same 3-d equation with slightly different coefficients .",
    "( the proof of this assertion will be presented elsewhere . )    finally a second simplification can be used for both cases if the acceleration region is homogeneous , or if one deals with a spatially unresolved acceleration region where one is interested in spatially integrated equations . in this case",
    "it is convenient to define the 2-d distribution function in terms of the particle energy @xmath33 , @xmath34 $ ] and @xmath35 $ ] , introduce spatially averaged terms @xmath36 and replace the spatial diffusion term by an escape term .",
    "then we obtain the following well known equation , sometimes referred to as the _ leaky box model _",

    "we use the form given in eq .",
    "( [ lbox ] ) which is more convenient for the inversion procedure . ]",
    "@xmath48 where @xmath49 the term @xmath50 is nearly equal to 1 at all @xmath51 ( it has a maximum of @xmath521.3 for @xmath53 ) . , where @xmath54 is used in @xcite and our earlier papers .",
    "]    because the acceleration rate in stochastic acceleration is proportional to the square of the velocity ratio @xmath55 , it is often regarded to be too slow to account for production of high - energy particles , especially in comparison to acceleration in a shock ( or a converging flow in general ) .",
    "for a shock with velocity @xmath56 , a particle of velocity @xmath57 upon crossing it gains momentum linearly with velocity ; @xmath58 , and therefore this often is referred to as a first - order fermi process .",
    "there are several misconceptions associated with the above statement .",
    "the first is that the diffusion coefficients , in general , increase with decreasing particle energy so that sa can be very efficient in the acceleration of low energy particles in the background plasma , which is where all acceleration processes must start @xcite .",
    "the second is that shock acceleration is not related to the original process @xcite , and the third is that shock acceleration rate is also second order .    in an unmagnetized shock , or in a shock with magnetic field parallel to the shock velocity , acceleration requires an scattering agent to recycle particles repeatedly across the shock .",
    "turbulence is the most likely agent for this .",
    "the acceleration rate then is @xmath59 , where the recycling time @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "thus , _ the shock acceleration rate , @xmath61 , is also a second order mechanism_. as shown by @xcite , for oblique shocks ( @xmath62 ) the acceleration rate also varies as the square of shock velocity , but in this case , specifically for a perpendicular shock ( @xmath63 ) the rate could be much higher . in general then , as emphasized in @xcite , in both sa by turbulence and shock acceleration the rates are proportional to the square of the velocity ratios @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , so that the distinction between them is greatly blurred . in either process",
    ", resonant scattering by turbulence provides rapid isotropization of the particle pitch angle distribution , a necessary prerequisite for efficient acceleration , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "more exactly , in the framework of the leaky box model , the shock acceleration rate can be written as @xmath66 where we have introduced the parameter @xmath67 with @xmath68 the compression ratio and @xmath69 which is a somewhat complicated function of the angle and the ratio of the diffusion coefficients parallel to perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath70 ; @xcite . for a parallel shock @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where subscript 1 and 2 refer to upstream and downstream region of the shock , respectively .",
    "the usual practice is to assume the bohm limit ; @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the gyro radius .",
    "in what follows we will use a more accurate relation for @xmath75 obtained from wave particle interactions , as those shown in figure ( 1 ) . for a perpendicular shock",
    "the relation again is simple and from @xcite we obtain @xmath76 ( for @xmath77 ) , which amounts to setting @xmath78 .    in applications to astrophysical sources we will be dealing with the scattering and stochastic acceleration times defined as as @xmath79 using these in eqs .",
    "( [ asa ] ) and ( [ ash ] ) we can write shock to sa acceleration rate ratio as @xmath80 where @xmath81 . for _ parallel shocks _ ( @xmath71 )",
    "this ratio becomes @xmath82 .",
    "as pointed out above ( and in @xcite ) , at low energies and for strong magnetic fields , @xmath83 indicating the dominance of sa .",
    "but for high energies and alfvnic turbulence @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the alfvn mach number , so shock acceleration dominates at high energies and weakly magnetized plasmas .",
    "figure [ savsshock ] shows a comparison between the sa timescale @xmath87 as defined in eq .",

    "as evident at low energies and small values of @xmath91 ( strong magnetization ) sa is the dominant mechanism . for oblique shocks the shock rate will be in general higher by some factor which depends on the angle @xmath92 ; e.g. for a high mach number ( @xmath93 ) perpendicular ( @xmath63 ) shock this factor will be @xmath94 .    )",
    "calculated using eq .",
    "( [ times ] ) and shock acceleration time ( denoted here as @xmath95 ) for interactions of electrons with parallel propagating plasma waves with power law spectral distribution for two indicies @xmath96 ( kolmogorov ) and 3 . here",
    "@xmath97 , the ratio of the electron plasma to gyro frequencies , is a measure of the degree of magnetization , and @xmath98 is the characteristic rate for wave - particle interactions .",
    "( see more details in @xcite . )",
    "note that for highly magnetized plasma ( @xmath99 , sa is the dominant mechanism at some energies , and even for a plasma with lower magnetization , sa can not be ignored .",
    "the shock velocity is taken to be @xmath100 km / s compared to the alfvn velocity @xmath101\\sim 7000 $ ] and 700 km / s , resulting in @xmath102 and 200 , respectively .",
    "the proportionality constants @xmath103 and @xmath104 are set to unity .",
    "note that the @xmath96 solid curves are multiplied by 100 for clarity . ]    in @xcite it was suggested that in presence of a shock the acceleration may be a hybrid process dominated by sa at low energies and shock at high energies . in what follows we will consider the combined processes , which depend on wave - particle interactions , shock compression ratio and background plasma parameters .    for a solution of the differential eq .",
    "( [ lbox ] ) we also need the energy dependence of the other terms . for the injected spectrum @xmath105 we will consider a maxwellian distribution at a given temperature @xmath106 , and for the energy loss we include ionization and coulomb losses that dominate at low energies ( and depend on background density @xmath17 and ionic composition ) , and synchrotron and inverse compton losses that dominate at high energies ( and depend on the background magnetic field and photon energy densities ) .",
    "coulomb interactions can also cause energy and pitch angle diffusion which become important at low energies , e.g. , @xcite .    as we will see below the last term , namely the escape time ,",
    "is the term that can be obtained most readily from observations , which then allows determination of the other terms .",
    "however , the relation of the escape time to the coefficients of the acceleration mechanism is complicated . as shown in @xcite",
    ", it is related to an integral of spatial diffusion term @xmath107 over the acceleration site .",
    "thus , it also depends on the size @xmath6 of this site or crossing time @xmath108 . for the isotropic case with @xmath109 , one expect the diffusion of the particles across the source to follow a random walk process , which means we can write @xmath110 . in the opposite limit , @xmath111 , the escape time @xmath112 .",
    "combining these two cases in the past we ( @xcite ) have used the approximate expression @xmath113 however , other geometric effects such as those produced by the large scale magnetic fields e.g. chaotic field lines , or strongly converging or diverging field configurations ( see @xcite ) , or deviation from isotropy or a simple spherical homogeneous acceleration site , can make the relation between @xmath114 and other acceleration coefficients more complex .",
    "solution of eq . ( [ lbox ] ) requires knowledge of energy and time dependences of the five coefficients involved in the terms on the right side . in situations",
    "where there exist time resolved observations one needs to solve for the time dependence of the accelerated spectrum . however , if the dynamic time @xmath22 describing the evolution is longer than the characteristic timescales associated with these coefficients ( such as @xmath115 and @xmath87 or energy diffusion time @xmath116 ) , then one can use the steady state assumption and set @xmath117 and modulate the results with the time profile of the dynamic process .",
    "this was the case in our application of the inversion method to solar flares . in the opposite situation of short dynamic time , and in the absence of temporally resolved observations",
    ", one can integrate eq .",
    "( [ lbox ] ) over the dynamic time in which case @xmath118 , because we expect @xmath119 for high energy particles . in this case one is dealing with the values of the coefficients averaged over duration @xmath120 of the process ; e.g average injected spectrum @xmath121 .",
    "as discussed below this will be the case for the application to snrs and cosmic ray electrons ( cres ) .",
    "thus , we need to consider only the energy dependence of the coefficients .",
    "two of these , namely @xmath40 and @xmath122 , depend on background plasma parameters @xmath123 and @xmath20 , and are independent of the acceleration process .",
    "we will assume that we have sufficient information on the background plasma so that we know the values and energy dependences of these two terms .",
    "the other three are related to the characteristics of the acceleration mechanism that we want to determine .",
    "one of these is the energy diffusion coefficient @xmath4 ( related to @xmath5 ) .",
    "the escape time depends on the size @xmath6 of the source and on the spatial diffusion rate ( related @xmath2 ) . the final term , namely the direct acceleration rate has contribution from turbulence , which is related to @xmath4 , and from shocks , which is related to @xmath2 and the characteristics of the shocks described above .",
    "assuming that we know the value of the latter and the size @xmath6 of the acceleration site , we are left with two primary unknowns @xmath2 and @xmath5 , or in terms of more directly unknowns @xmath4 and @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the energy dependences of these two coefficients , we need the variation with energy of two independent observed quantities , as described next .      as described in @xcite , one of the two functions that observations can provide is the ( spatially integrated ) energy spectrum of the accelerated particles @xmath124 , which can be deduced from the observed total photon spectrum @xmath125 produced in the acceleration region . , where @xmath126 stands for the radiative cross section .",
    "] if the escape time is finite then the rate of particles escaping will be @xmath127 .",
    "if this spectrum is measured directly , we then can obtain the escape time simply as @xmath128 if we assume that eq .",
    "( [ tesct ] ) is an accurate description of how particles escape , we can then obtain also the scattering time @xmath129 this will then give a measure of the pitch angle diffusion coefficients @xmath2 and as shown by eqs.([ash ] ) and ( [ times ] ) , it will also give the acceleration rate by the shock @xmath130 , assuming we know @xmath103 .",
    "given the above information we are left with only two related unknowns , namely the energy diffusion coefficient @xmath4 or the direct sa rate @xmath131 .",
    "this final unknown can be obtained using our knowledge of the accelerated particle spectra @xmath124 and the escape time @xmath132 by the inversion of the leaky box eq .",
    "( [ lbox ] ) as follows .",
    "the key aspect here is to recognize that this ordinary differential equation is only first - order in the derivative of @xmath4 with respect to @xmath33 , instead of second - order that appears to be the case in its alternate form .",
    "thus , by utilizing the relation between @xmath133 and @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ asa ] ) we can rewrite the steady state leaky box equation as @xmath134 + \\frac{d}{d e}\\left[(\\dot{e}_{\\rm l}-a_{\\rm sh})n\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ = \\frac{n}{t_{\\rm esc}}-{\\dot q}_{\\rm inj},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrating this from @xmath33 to @xmath135 gives @xmath136 \\nonumber\\\\ \\times\\left(2{\\bar \\xi}- \\frac{d \\ln{n}}{d \\ln{e } } \\right)^{-1 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which we obtain @xmath137 .",
    "thus , all the terms on the right - hand side can in principle be obtained directly from observables .",
    "note that for the time integrated equation under consideration here we must have the equality @xmath138 .",
    "but for relevant energies of @xmath139 only a number of particles in the maxwellian tail contribute and @xmath140 .",
    "if this were not true there would be very few particles accelerated and the case is uninteresting .",
    "thus , in what follows we can neglect the injection term .",
    "however , given the temperature of the background particles this term can be easily calculated and included in the results .    finally we define an effective acceleration rate as @xmath141 where @xmath142 , and we have introduced the spectral index of the accelerated particles @xmath143 . at relativistic energies @xmath144 and , as we will see below , typically @xmath145 , so this rate is sum of the shock and ( about two times ) sa rates .",
    "escaping particle are measured directly or by the detection of the radiation they produce outside the acceleration site , which we will call the transport region , where their spectrum is modified due to transport effects .",
    "these effects can be treated by a similar kinetic equation without the diffusion and acceleration terms . if the particles are injected into a finite region and if one can neglect further acceleration and assume that pitch angle scattering quickly isotropizes the particle distribution , then the evolution of particles in the transport region can be described by the leaky box eq .",

    "second , we note that this last integrand is identical to the third term inside the square brackets on the right - hand side of eq .",

    "here we explore the possibility of using the radiative signatures of snrs and observed spectra of cres in the interstellar medium ( ism ) to determine the characteristics of the acceleration mechanism in snrs .",
    "it has been the common belief that snrs are the source of the observed crs ( at least up to the knee at @xmath5210@xmath163 ev ) and recent high energy gamma - ray observations of snrs have enforced this belief considerably .",

    "however , it should be emphasized that the situation here is not as straightforward as in solar flares where these two functions are determined simultaneously for individual flares . here",
    "we need knowledge of the transport to the earth of the electrons escaping the snrs , and a more important complexity is that , many and a diverse set of snrs , resulting from explosions of different progenitor stars in different environments , contribute to the crs in the ism .",
    "we will address these complexities in the following sections .",
    "many snrs are observed optically and at radio .",

    "a pure leptonic scenario , whereby the gamma - rays are produced by the synchrotron emitting electrons via the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) or other soft photons , seems to work @xcite .",
    "while in others , e.g. , snr tycho @xcite , the hadronic scenario , whereby the accelerated protons are responsible for the gamma - rays , fits the data better . in some others , e.g. , snr vela jr",

    "unfortunately this technique can not be used for snrs",

    "we express all particle energies in units of a fiducial energy @xmath171 , which we set equal to 100 gev for numerical purposes .",

    "synchrotron losses dominate over ic losses and the radiative loss time in the acceleration site required for our procedure can be written as @xmath182 where @xmath183 and @xmath184 is the thomson cross section .    as mentioned above , however",
    ", supernova explosions and snrs may have a broad range of characteristics and parameters of acceleration .",

    "( [ snrspec ] ) seems to be a reasonable approximation .",
    "it should be noted though that explosions and environments of the upper end main sequence stars are considerably different than those of lower mass stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) and could possibly yield different accelerated spectra .",
    "unfortunately there are no observations of remnants of such stars .",
    "this is mainly because they are rarer , which would also mean they contribute less to crs .",
    "in addition , explosions into a hot stellar wind environment may lead to a lower mach number shock and a weaker accelerator . on the other hand , being more powerful explosions",
    "could have an opposite effect , which would enhance their contribution .    in the absence of observational evidence about the distribution of characteristics of stellar explosions and snr spectra , in what follows",
    "we will use the spectral form given in eq .",
    "( [ snrspec ] ) for the accelerated spectrum @xmath164 , with the cautionary remark that the above unknown may introduce a significant uncertainty in our final results .",
    "as mentioned above , it is widely believed that snrs are the source of all crs , and we will assume this to be the case for cres . therefore , the spectra of crs are related to those of the particles emitting the snr radiation via the escape time from the snrs .",
    "the escaping particles interact with the galactic background matter and electromagnetic fields producing the galactic diffuse emission from radio to high energy gamma - rays .",
    "these interactions and other processes modify the escaping particle spectra during their transport to where they radiate and to near the earth where they are observed directly .",
    "therefore , crs are expected to have different spectra than snrs with the difference being partially due to the energy dependence of the escape time and partially due to energy losses during their transport in the galaxy .",
    "observations witness these differences . for example , radio spectra of snrs are flatter than those of diffuse radio emission in the ism , and the measured cre spectrum @xmath191 is different than that given in eq .",

    "different analyses give different explanations for the prominent bump seen around 100 gev .",

    "an alternative and simpler explanation of the bump in the cre spectrum was given in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , who show that the energy dependence of radiative losses due to combined synchrotron and ic scattering ( by star light , infrared and cmb photons ) can account for this deviation .",
    "this is because at low energies star light is the dominant agent of loss , but at higher energies ic scattering by star light enters the klein - nishina ( kn for short ) regime which suppresses these losses and there is a transition to ic losses to infrared and cmb photons ( which are still in the thomson regime up to energies of a few tev ) and/or synchrotron losses ( depending on the value of the magnetic field ) . for typical values of the relevant quantities in the solar neighborhood",

    "we will use the fiducial value of 10 pc ( to include the effects of the chaotic structure of the large scale magnetic field ; see footnote 1 ) which gives us a crossing time @xmath298 yr .",

    "there is more uncertainty in the first of the above two ways of computing the scattering time ; for example , as mentioned above and in footnote 2 , in a chaotic magnetic field of scale @xmath323 the effective crossing time will be larger by @xmath324 , which will reduce the above discrepancy by the square of this factor .",
    "thus , for concordance we require @xmath325 pc ; ( e.g. , @xmath326 pc for @xmath327 pc ) . as mentioned in connection with eq .",
    "( [ rateratio ] ) , for a perpendicular shock this ratio decreases by the factor @xmath328 expected to be much larger than one so that the required conditions may not be as extreme .",
    "more generally , the validity of the use of the random walk relation between escape and scattering times may also be questionable , so that these results may be telling us that the relation of the escape time to the scattering and crossing times is more complicated than given by the random walk hypothesis .",

    "this lead us to our _ first conclusion that , in addition to a steeper spectrum for accelerated electrons , either these values are off by an order of magnitude , or that the escape time is not related to the crossing time in the simple way one obtains from the random walk scenario .",
    "the latter is an important result and needs further exploration . _",
    "@xmath342 on the other hand , in absence of a sufficient intensity of turbulence in the upstream region , whose presence is only conjectured and not established definitely yet , one can have a pure sa of particles in the turbulent downstream region .",
    "it turns out that in this scenario the absolute values of the two scattering times roughly agree .",
    "_ this , lead us to the second conclusion that in the sa scenario having a steeper accelerated electron spectrum is sufficient and it requires a spectrum of turbulence that is slightly steeper than kolmogorov . _    these are clearly preliminary results , but they demonstrate the power of the inversion method developed here .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the existing data on emission from snrs and transport of the cres can provide better values and forms for the observables required for the inversion , and a more detailed analysis of the inversion , e.g. , including time dependence , can constrain the models further .",
    "these will be addressed in future publications .",
    "but we can conclude that the above results indicate that either the spectrum of injected electrons in the ism deduced from cre and galactic diffuse emissions ( eq . [ qinjobs ] ) is incorrect and/or the simple relation between escape and scattering times used assuming the random walk scenario is incorrect .",
    "the latter is more likely to be the case and is similar to the conclusion we reached applying these techniques to solar flares .",
    "there mirroring of electrons in a converging magnetic field configuration was invoked to resolve a similar discrepancy .",
    "perhaps a complex large scale field geometry can help in snrs as well . on the other hand ,",
    "more consistent results are obtained for a pure stochastic acceleration scenario ."
