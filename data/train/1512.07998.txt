    "the two brightest class ii methanol maser transitions ( 6.7- and 12.2-ghz ) are now known to be uniquely associated with a very early phase of high - mass star formation and to be reliable tracers of high - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) @xcite . it has been postulated from the maser morphologies that they could be tracing a circumstellar disc or torus ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , or collimated outflows associated with the high - mass yso ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "multiple epoch and monitoring observations of the 6.7- and 12.2-ghz masers in many star forming regions have shown that the masers are variable and in some cases highly variable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the masers are sensitive to the physical conditions in the circumstellar environment , the observed variability of the masers must tell us something about changes either in the physical conditions where the masers operate or in the conditions of the region where the seed photons , which stimulate the emission , originate .",
    "maser monitoring can therefore be a useful probe of the physical conditions of those parts of the circumstellar environments that affect the masers .    in a monitoring programme to test the nature of the variability in 54 methanol sources , seven sources showed periodic variations @xcite .",
    "the discovery of periodic variability in the 6.7- and 12.2-ghz methanol masers reported by @xcite was unexpected as it had not been previously reported in any maser transitions associated with high - mass star formation regions .",
    "further monitoring programmes have been conducted independently and confirmed the existence of periodic variations in eight more methanol masers @xcite , bringing the total number of periodic masers to 15 .    in an attempt to explain the origin of the periodic masers ,",
    "five mechanisms have been proposed , three of which suggest that the variations are due to changes in the temperature of the dust grains that are responsible for the infrared radiation field that pumps the masers . these are ( i ) the rotation of spiral shocks in the gaps of discs around young binary stars @xcite , ( ii ) periodic accretion in a circumbinary system @xcite and ( iii ) the pulsation of a yso @xcite .",
    "the remaining two mechanisms propose that the origin of variations is the result of changes in the flux of seed photons ( or radio continuum ) owing to either ( iv ) a colliding wind binary ( cwb ) system @xcite or ( v ) a very young low mass companion blocking the uv radiation from the high - mass star in an eclipsing binary @xcite .",
    "there is currently no direct observational evidence to support any of the five proposed mechanisms .",
    "the observed light - curves from the fifteen periodic methanol masers show a wide variety of shapes . @xcite classified the light - curves in four groups and argued that the light - curves could be a trace of the origin of the observed periodic masers .",
    "it remains to be seen if there are more groups or whether these are the only ones .",
    "it was also proposed by @xcite that there could be a total of 34 @xmath0 10 periodic sources in the 6.7-ghz methanol multibeam ( mmb ) survey catalogues i , ii , iii , and iv @xcite .",
    "this implies that monitoring more sources in the 6.7-ghz mmb survey catalogues , including the recently published catalogue v @xcite , could result in the discovery of more periodic sources .",
    "such new discoveries could result in a better characterisation of the observed light - curves , and their possible relation to the period if such a relation does exist at all .",
    "there are also possibilities for new mechanisms to explain the origin of periodicity because some of the existing proposals use the light - curves as the guide for their arguments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to increase our sample of periodic methanol masers and improve the understanding of the methanol masers periodic variations and characterise light - curves , more sources should be monitored .",
    "ten sources from the 6.7-ghz mmb survey catalogues iii and iv were considered for monitoring at both 6.7- and 12.2-ghz . from the sample of ten ,",
    "only the masers associated with g339.986 - 0.425 show periodic variations at both 6.7- and 12.2-ghz .",
    "this paper describes the details of the methods used for data collection , reduction , calibration , results and analysis .",
    "from the 6.7-ghz mmb survey catalogues iii and iv , ten sources associated with methanol masers were selected for the monitoring programme with the 26 m hartrao radio telescope at both 6.7- and 12.2-ghz .",
    "the list of sources in the sample is given in table [ tab : sources_list ] .",
    "the selection criterion for these sources was the same as given by @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "as already noted , the observed time series give us only one sampling of the true light - curve to which we fitted an asymmetric cosine function to estimate , amongst other things , the period . to find the statistical error on the period from fitting an asymmetric cosine to the light - curve",
    "a large number of independent sampling of the same size of the light - curve is necessary . for",
    "each sampling the period can be estimated by fitting an asymmetric cosine and by repeating this procedure for a large number of different samplings , it is possible to find the mean and standard deviation of the estimated periods . to by -",
    "pass the problem that the observed 6.7- and 12.2-ghz time series each represent only one specific sampling of the respective light - curves , we note that the sampling data allows us to construct a reduced time series , i.e. a time series with fewer sampling points than the total number of sampling points .",
    "for example , in the case of the 6.7-ghz masers the total time series consists of 66 time - stamps for which there are @xmath1 combinations of time - stamps that can be used to construct a reduced time series consisting of @xmath2 time - stamps . for each combination",
    "an asymmetric cosine can be fitted to the reduced time series to estimate the period . using all @xmath3 combinations result in @xmath3 different periods from which a mean period and standard deviation for a time series with @xmath2 time - stamps , can be calculated .",
    "it is then possible to investigate the behaviour of the error as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath5 and extrapolate that result to @xmath6 .",
    "the total number of combinations , @xmath3 , can be very large , which , from a computational point of view , makes it unpractical to use all @xmath3 combinations .",
    "we have therefore limited @xmath3 to 500 and applied the above procedure for @xmath7 for the 6.7-ghz masers and @xmath8 for the 12.2-ghz masers .",
    "figure [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_6ghz_error_vs_sample_size ] shows how the period ( bottom panel ) changes as a function of @xmath4 for the 6.7-ghz maser feature at -89.137kms@xmath9 . using the central limit theorem as a guide",
    ", we found that the error is proportional to @xmath10 with the corresponding result shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_6ghz_error_vs_sample_size ] .",
    "the behaviour for the other maser features was found to be similar and is therefore not shown . since the error in the period is proportional to @xmath10 , we can estimate the error in the period for @xmath11 and @xmath12 from an extrapolation of a first order polynomial fitted to the relevant data for each maser feature .",
    "the mean period and the extrapolated error on the period for all the maser features shown in figures [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_67ghz_timeseries ] and [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_12ghz_timeseries ] are given in column 3 of table [ tab : periods_list_increasesamplesize ] .    in the third case we applied the above procedure to synthetic time series simulated by randomly generating @xmath13",
    "uniformly distributed time - stamps between the start and end mjd of the observed time series .",
    "the remaining two time - stamps were the start and end times of the real time series .",
    "fixing the end point implies that every time series spanned 1015 days .",
    "the light - curve was assumed to be given exactly by the asymmetric cosine fitted to the real data .",
    "two sources of scatter around the mean were introduced .",
    "the first was to randomly sample from the observed experimental errors .",
    "the second was to sample , also randomly , from the residuals between the observed flux densities and the fit from the asymmetric cosine to the real time series .",
    "for each value of @xmath4 , with @xmath14 , 500 synthetic time series were generated and an asymmetric cosine was fitted to each of them , from which the mean and standard deviation of the period were determined .",
    "the relation between the standard deviation and @xmath10 , and mean period and @xmath4 as obtained by using fit to the time series of the -89.137kms@xmath9  maser feature are shown in the top and bottom panel of figure [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_6ghz_error_vs_sample_size ] , respectively .",
    "the behaviour observed in figure [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_6ghz_error_vs_sample_size ] were also noted in the other time series shown in figures [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_67ghz_timeseries ] and [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_12ghz_timeseries ] .",
    "we can use the fitted first order polynomial to the relation between the standard deviation and @xmath10 to calculate the standard deviation for sample sizes @xmath4 = 66 and @xmath4 = 70 corresponding to the number of time stamps for the real 6.7- and 12.2-ghz time series respectively .",
    "a summary of the average period and the standard deviation of the estimated periods is given in the fourth column of table [ tab : periods_list_increasesamplesize ] .",
    "it is seen that the uncertainties in the periods obtained with the latter two monte - carlo simulations ranges between 0.9 and 2 days .",
    "the periods in table [ tab : periods_list_increasesamplesize ] are in a very good agreement with each other and with the periods given in tables [ tab : periods ] and [ tab : asymetric_cosine_periods ] . if we assume that the time series shown in figures [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_67ghz_timeseries ] and [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_12ghz_timeseries ] are statistical independent then the unweighted average period and its uncertainty are 246 @xmath0 2 and 246 @xmath0 1 days for the periods in column 3 and 4 of table [ tab : periods_list_increasesamplesize ] , respectively .    since the latter two monte - carlo simulations give results that are in a good agreement with each other , we argue further that we can reliably extrapolate the time series to have more than the observed cycles by using the same approach as in our third monte - carlo method .",
    "this is to investigate how the uncertainty in the period derived from the lomb - scargle and epoch - folding methods depends on the number of cycles .",
    "the time series of the -89.137kms@xmath9maser feature was used for this test .",
    "after 40 cycles , the determined periods were 246 @xmath0 3 and 246 @xmath0 1 days for the lomb - scargle and epoch - folding methods , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties in the period are seen to be in good agreement with those estimated above and is in support of an error of about 1 day when fitting an asymmetric cosine to the data .",
    "we therefore conclude that the period of the 6.7- and 12.2-ghz masers associated with g339.986 - 0.425 is 246 @xmath0 1 days .",
    "the time series in figures [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_67ghz_timeseries ] and [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_12ghz_timeseries ] suggest that there are correlations between the 6.7- and 12.2-ghz masers , as well as across the channels of each maser .",
    "the correlation and time delay between pairs of time series were tested with the zdcf .",
    "the results for the correlation and time delay between the two masers ( 6.7- and 12.2-ghz ) of a few selected velocities are shown in figure [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_6_and_12_timedelay ] .",
    "the location of a peak in figure [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_6_and_12_timedelay ] , which was the time delay , was determined from the turning point of a second order polynomial weighted chi - square fit .",
    "the errors in the fitted parameters were estimated from the diagonal of the covariant matrix s inverse @xcite .",
    "the error in the location of the turning point , which is the time delay , was estimated from the errors of the second order polynomial coefficients using propagation of error formula .",
    "a summary of the determined time delay as a function of velocity for both 6.7- and 12.2-ghz is shown in figure [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_timedelay ] .",
    "the -89.400kms@xmath9   was present at both 6.7- and 12.2-ghz spectra , and was therefore used as a reference time series for each maser .",
    "it is seen in figure [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_timedelay ] that for both 6.7- and 12.2-ghz masers the delays are negative for the velocities less than -89.400kms@xmath9 .",
    "the 6.7-ghz maser starts with a delay of about -20 days delay at around 91.0kms@xmath9 .",
    "the delay decreases up to the reference velocity , then starts to increase into positive days to reach the local minimum .",
    "after the local minimum , the delay decreases to zero days . up to this point",
    ", the general behaviour for both 6.7- and 12.2-ghz maser time delays is similar . from this point ,",
    "the 6.7- and 12.2-ghz are different but both show well defined structure which appear to be continuous .",
    "one of the noticeable difference between the 6.7- and 12.2-ghz maser delays is around -88.3kms@xmath9  where the 12.2-ghz is at local minimum and the 6.7-ghz is almost at its absolute maximum .",
    "for velocities greater than -88.0kms@xmath9 , both shows an increase in the delays with 6.7-ghz increasing to about -66 @xmath0 29 days .",
    "the delays for the 6.7- and 12.2-ghz masers range from -66 to 28 , and from -12 to 4 days respectively .      in order to find the maser spot distributions and attempt to link it with time delays shown in figure [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_timedelay ] , the 6.7-ghz masers associated with the g339.986 - 0.425 data cube was deconvolved with common astronomy software applications ( casa ) .",
    "the positions of the maser features in each channel with emission were calculated with aips task jmfit which output the coordinates of the positions and their uncertainties .",
    "the declination ( dec ) and right ascension ( ra ) offsets were calculated from the following equations : @xmath15 where dec0 and ra0 are the position coordinates of the reference channel .",
    "the dec and ra offsets plot for the maser spots distribution is shown in figure [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_67_spotmap ] . the distributions do not show a simple morphology such as linear , elliptic or circular structures . the uncertainties of the maser spot coordinates suggest that the source is not resolved with atca .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_timedelay ] there are time delays across the channels which could suggest a structure which is correlated with velocity . in order to test for possible links between the measured time delays and maser spots relative spatial distribution , the velocity versus",
    "distance offset plot was made to test for velocity gradient and the results are shown figure [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_67_distance_offset ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the distance offsets were derived from the propagation of error formula .",
    "the offset distances were calculated from the dec and ra offsets using the distance formula given by equation [ eq : distance_offset ] .",
    "@xmath16 the error in the reference distance offset was undefined as the distance of the reference channel is zero .",
    "the uncertainty on the reference channel was therefore set to zero . the positional error in figure [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_67_distance_offset ]",
    "are too large to draw a conclusion about a velocity gradient of the 6.7-ghz masers associated with g339.986 - 0.425 .",
    "as already noted earlier , a number of hypotheses have been made in the past to explain the periodic behaviour of the methanol masers .",
    "the question now is whether the periodic behaviour of the masers in g339.986 - 0.425 can be explained within the framework of any these proposals .",
    "the main difficulty in trying to answer this question is that most of these proposals only broadly suggest a particular mechanism but do not predict a specific flare profile or waveform . at present only the colliding - wind binary model of @xcite allows for the explicit calculation of a flare profile . for two other proposals , i.e. that of @xcite and @xcite , is it possible to infer possible flare profiles or light - curves ? as for the model of @xcite , these authors explicitly state that their model is aimed to reproduce the characteristic features of the maser flares as seen in , for example , g9.62 + 0.20e .",
    "the flaring behaviour in g9.62 + 0.20e is , however , quite different from that of g339.986 - 0.425 and we therefore will not consider this scenario any further .",
    "the second scenario is the colliding - wind binary model of @xcite .",
    "although this model was originally developed to explain the flaring behaviour of the masers in g9.62 + 0.20e , @xcite also applied it to the smaller amplitude periodic masers in g188.95 + 0.89 . using the toy model of @xcite",
    "we explored the parameter space to try to produce a light - curve similar to that of g339.986 - 0.425 .",
    "light - curves or flare profiles that very much resembles that of g339.986 - 0.425 could be found for orbits with an eccentricity of about 0.3",
    ". however , lowering the eccentricity necessarily lowers the amplitude of the flaring behaviour and in all these cases it was not possible to reproduce the amplitude of the variations seen in g339.986 - 0.425 .",
    "lowering the eccentricity , reduces ionisation shock front variation range .",
    "this is expected to results in a small amplitude variations range .",
    "we therefore conclude that also the cwb model can not explain the periodic maser in g339.986 - 0.425 .",
    "the third scenario is that of @xcite , which suggests that the observed flaring is due to a pulsating young high - mass star . as in the case of @xcite ,",
    "these authors do not explicitly present a predicted light - curve .",
    "however , the underlying mechanism for pulsationally unstable is , according to @xcite , the @xmath17-mechanism which is the same as for many other pulsating stars .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect the light - curve of the pulsating high - mass star to be similar to that of other pulsating stars also driven by the @xmath17-mechanism like e.g. cepheids and the rr lyrae stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , we note that there are oh / ir stars with periods similar to that of g339.986 - 0.425 and that the light - curves of the associated oh masers can also be fitted quite well with asymmetric cosines @xcite as is also the case for g339.986 - 0.425 .",
    "thus , considering the shape of the light - curve of the methanol masers in g339.986 - 0.425 we conclude that it is compatible with what is expected from an underlying pulsating high - mass star . adopting the results of @xcite",
    "the mass of the star can be calculated from their equation 2 and in this case is found to be about 23 solar masses .",
    "the question may arise whether the measured delays can be explained under the consideration of the yso s pulsational instability as the origin of the periodicity .",
    "the masing cloudlets separations around high - mass yso are very small compared to the distance between the maser cloudlets and the observer .",
    "this implies that the emissions from masing cloudlets in the region will travel approximately equal distances to the observer .",
    "the measured time delay in the maser time series could be due to their relative spatial positions to the pulsating yso .",
    "this ignores the effects of radiation reprocessing .",
    "if the masing cloudlets and yso are projected onto a 2-d plane , then the time delays give the least separation distances of the masing cloudlets .",
    "if the disturbances travel with the speed of light in a vacuum , an 8 @xmath0 3 day time delay between the 6.7- and 12.2-ghz at -89.400kms@xmath9  implies that these masers are ( 1.4 @xmath0 0.5)@xmath18 au apart , which is larger than the diameter of the solar system",
    ". since the velocities are the same , the kinematics around these masers are more likely to be similar because the masers are expected to be close to each other in the molecular cloud . for a sound speed in a molecular cloud of @xmath19 0.5kms@xmath9 , derived using equation 15.22 in @xcite with",
    "the temperature assumed to be 100 k , and the disturbances travel at sound speed , then an 8 @xmath0 3 day time delay implies that the -89.400kms@xmath9  maser features at 6.7- and 12.2-ghz are @xmath19 ( 2.3 @xmath0 0.7)@xmath20 au apart .",
    "the separation is quite small .",
    "however , from the maser spot map ( figure [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_67_spotmap ] ) we approximate the total extent of the maser emission angular separation to be 0.4 arcseconds . the galactic longitude of g339.986 - 0.425 with a maser peak velocity of -89.0kms@xmath9  can be used to derive the near kinematic distance to the source using the rotation curve of @xcite , and it is @xmath19 5.6 kpc . using the derived near kinematical distance to g339.986 - 0.425 , @xmath19 5.6 kpc , and the total extent of the maser emission angular separation of @xmath19 0.4 arcseconds , the diameter of the total extent of the maser emission was calculated to be @xmath19 0.01 pc or @xmath19 12 light days .",
    "the diameter of the 6.7-ghz maser emission in g339.986 - 0.425 was found to be in good agreement with the typical methanol maser region linear size of 0.003 pc for the near kinematics distances of 6 kpc derived by @xcite . if the disturbances travel with a sound speed of @xmath19 0.5kms@xmath9",
    ", it will take about 2@xmath21 years to travel the distance of 0.01 pc . the maximum time delay measured in figure [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_timedelay ]",
    "is 66 @xmath0 28 days . in the case where the disturbances travel with the speed of light in a vacuum , the separation distance for the maser features would be ( 1.1 @xmath0 0.5)@xmath21 au or 0.06 @xmath0 0.02 pc which is larger than the approximated total masing cloudlets diameter .",
    "if the disturbances travel at sound speed then the separation between these maser features would be ( 1.9 @xmath0 0.8)@xmath22 au , which is much smaller than 0.01 pc . from this analysis ,",
    "it is clear that if the disturbances travel at sound speed , then the total extent of the masing region is in many orders of magnitude too small for a typical methanol masing region of about 0.003 pc @xcite . given that we see the masers in projection that strongly suggests that it is either the seed photons or something directly related to radiation that is causing the periodic changes .",
    "the measured delayed time delays in g339.986 - 0.425 are not easy to explain . for a better understanding of such large delays and the time delays structure seen in figure [ fig : g339.986 - 0.425_timedelay ] , interferometric data with a similar spectral resolution as the one obtained with the 26 m hartrao radio telescope and high spatial resolution of the source is vital .",
    "the spectral resolution of the atca data was 1.25 greater than the 26 m hartrao radio telescope data .",
    "a search for periodic methanol masers associated with high - mass ysos was conducted with the 26 m hartrao telescope and ten methanol masers from the 6.7-ghz mmb survey catalogues iii and iv were selected as the candidates for the search .",
    "the methanol maser associated with g339.986 - 0.425 at 6.7- and 12.2-ghz was the only source from ten source sample to show periodic variations with a 246 @xmath0 1 day period .",
    "the time series of the two brightest class ii methanol masers associated with g339.986 - 0.425 show strong correlations and time delays between the maser species and across the velocity channels .",
    "the calculated time delays show remarkable structure when plotted against velocities .",
    "the meaning of the structure is not clear as the interferometric maser distribution did not help , mainly due to , insufficient spatial and spectral resolution .",
    "another remarkable behaviour was the time delay of 8 days between the -89.400kms@xmath9  feature for both 6.7- and 12.2-ghz masers .",
    "the velocity was the same for both masers which suggests that the kinematics could be similar if not the same .",
    "the catalogue for periodic masers has been increased to sixteen sources and will certainly improve the statistical analysis of these sources .",
    "the g339.986 - 0.425 light - curves had lead to the proposal that high - mass yso pulsational instability could be the origin of the periodicity .",
    "however , the origin of the periodic variations in maser is still to be confirmed .",
    "numerical modelling could possibly help in narrowing the possibilities or introduce possible new model in the origin of the observed periodicity in methanol masers , e.g. , testing the maser - response to the wide variety of time - dependent dust temperature light - curves .",

    "<S> only masers associated with g339.986 - 0.425 were found to show periodic variability at both 6.7 and 12.2 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of periodic variation was tested with four independent methods . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical method gave the best estimation of the period , which was 246 @xmath0 1 days . </S>",
    "<S> the time series of g339.986 - 0.425 show strong correlations across velocity channels and between the 6.7 and 12.2 ghz masers . </S>",
    "<S> the time delay was also measured across channels and shows structure across the spectrum which is continuous between different maser components .    </S>",
