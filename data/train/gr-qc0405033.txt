    "in modern theoretical physics particle interactions are described by gauge theories .",
    "these theories are constructed by demanding that symmetries in the laws of physics should be local , rather than global , in character .",
    "the clearest expositions of this principle are contained in quantum theory , where one initially constructs a lagrangian containing a global symmetry . in order to promote this to a local symmetry ,",
    "the derivatives appearing in the lagrangian are modified so that they are unchanged in form by local transformations .",
    "this is achieved by the introduction of fields with certain transformation properties ( ` gauge fields ' ) , and these fields are then responsible for inter - particle forces .",
    "the manner in which the gauge fields couple to matter is determined by the ` minimal coupling ' procedure , in which partial ( or directional ) derivatives are replaced by covariant derivatives .",
    "this is the general framework that has been applied so successfully in the construction of the standard model of particle physics , which accounts for the strong , weak and electromagnetic forces .",
    "but what of gravity : can general relativity be formulated as a gauge theory ?",
    "this question has troubled physicists for many years  @xcite . the first work that recovered features of general relativity from a gauging argument was due to kibble  @xcite , who elaborated on an earlier , unsuccessful attempt by utiyama  @xcite .",
    "kibble used the 10-component poincar group of passive infinitesimal coordinate transformations ( consisting of four translations and six rotations ) as the global symmetry group . by gauging this group and constructing a suitable lagrangian density for the gauge fields , kibble arrived at a set of gravitational field equations  though not the einstein equations .",
    "in fact , kibble arrived at a slightly more general theory , known as a ` spin - torsion ' theory .",
    "the necessary modifications to einstein s theory to include torsion were first suggested by cartan  @xcite , who identified torsion as a possible physical field .",
    "the connection between quantum spin and torsion was made later  @xcite , once it had become clear that the stress - energy tensor for a massive fermion field must be asymmetric  @xcite .",
    "spin - torsion theories are sometimes referred to as einstein  cartan  kibble",
    " sciama theories .",
    "kibble s use of passive transformations was criticised by hehl _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who reproduced kibble s derivation from the standpoint of active transformations of the matter fields .",
    "_ also arrived at a spin - torsion theory , and it is now generally accepted that torsion is an inevitable feature of a gauge theory based on the poincar group .",
    "the work of hehl _ et al . _",
    "@xcite raises a further issue . in their gauge theory derivation hehl _",
    "are clear that ` _ coordinates and frames are regarded as fixed once and for all , while the matter fields are replaced by fields that have been rotated or translated _ ' .",
    "it follows that the derivation can only affect the properties of the matter fields , and not the properties of spacetime itself . yet , once the gauge fields have been introduced , the authors identify these fields as determining the curvature and torsion of a riemann  cartan spacetime .",
    "this is possible only if it is assumed from the outset that one is working in a riemann ",
    "cartan spacetime , and not in flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "but the idea that spacetime is curved is one of the cornerstone principles of general relativity . that this feature must be introduced _ a priori _ , and is not derivable from the gauge theory argument , is highly undesirable",
    " it shows that the principle of local gauge invariance must be supplemented with further assumptions before general relativity is recovered .",
    "the conclusions are clear : classical general relativity must be modified by the introduction of a spin - torsion interaction if it is to be viewed as a gauge theory , and the gauge principle alone fails to provide a conceptual framework for general relativity as a theory of gravity .    in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative theory of gravity that is derived from gauge principles alone .",
    "these gauge fields are functions of position in a single minkowski vector space .",
    "but here we immediately hit a profound difficulty .",
    "parameterising points with vectors implies a notion of a newtonian ` absolute space ' ( or spacetime ) and one of the aims of general relativity was to banish this idea .",
    "so can we possibly retain the idea of representing points with vectors without introducing a notion of absolute space ?",
    "the answer to this is yes  we must construct a theory in which points are parameterised by vectors , but the physical relations between fields are independent of where the fields are placed in this vector space",
    ". we must therefore be free to move the fields around the vector space in an arbitrary manner , without in any way affecting the physical predictions . in this way our abstract minkowski vector space will play an entirely passive role in physics , and what will remain are a set of ` intrinsic ' relations between spacetime fields at the same point . yet , once we have chosen a particular parameterisation of points with vectors , we will be free to exploit the vector space structure to the full , secure in the knowledge that any physical prediction arrived at is ultimately independent of the parameterisation .",
    "the theory we aim to construct is therefore one that is invariant under arbitrary field displacements .",
    "it is here that we make contact with gauge theories , because the necessary modification to the directional derivatives requires the introduction of a gauge field .",
    "but the field required is not of the type usually obtained when constructing gauge theories based on lie - group symmetries .",
    "the gauge field coupling is of an altogether different , though very natural , character .",
    "however , this does not alter the fact that the theory constructed here is a gauge theory in the broader sense of being invariant under a group of transformations .",
    "the treatment presented here is very different from that of kibble  @xcite and hehl _ et al . _",
    "these authors only considered infinitesimal translations , whereas we are able to treat arbitrary finite field displacements .",
    "this is essential to our aim of constructing a theory that is independent of the means by which the positions of fields are parameterised by vectors .",
    "once we have introduced the required ` position - gauge ' field , a further spacetime symmetry remains .",
    "spacetime fields are not simply scalars , but also consist of vectors and tensors .",
    "suppose that two spacetime vector fields are equated at some position .",
    "if both fields are then rotated at a point , the same intrinsic physical relation is obtained .",
    "we therefore expect that all physical relations should be invariant under local rotations of the matter fields , as well as displacements .",
    "this is necessary if we are to achieve complete freedom from the properties of the underlying vector space  we can not think of the vectors representing physical quantities as having direction defined relative to some fixed vectors in minkowski spacetime , but are only permitted to consider relations between matter fields .",
    "achieving invariance under local rotations introduces a further gauge field , though now we are in the familiar territory of yang  mills type interactions ( albeit employing a non - compact lie group ) .",
    "there are many ways in which the gauge theory presented here offers both real and potential advantages over traditional general relativity .",
    "as our theory is a genuine gauge theory , the status of physical predictions is always unambiguous  any physical prediction must be extracted from the theory in a gauge - invariant manner . furthermore , our approach is much closer to the conventional theories of particle physics , which should ease the path to a quantum theory .",
    "one further point is that discarding all notions of a curved spacetime makes the theory conceptually much simpler than general relativity .",
    "for example , there is no need to deal with topics such as differentiable manifolds , tangent spaces or fibre bundles  @xcite .",
    "the theory developed here is presented in the language of ` _ geometric algebra _ '  @xcite .",
    "any physical theory can be formulated in a number of different mathematical languages , but physicists usually settle on a language which they feel represents the ` optimal ' choice . for quantum field theory",
    "this has become the language of abstract operator commutation relations , and for general relativity it is riemannian geometry . for our gauge theory of gravity there seems little doubt that geometric algebra is the optimal language available in which to formulate the theory .",
    "indeed , it was partly the desire to apply this language to gravitation theory that led to the development of the present theory .",
    "( this should not be taken to imply that geometric algebra can not be applied to standard general relativity  it certainly can  @xcite .",
    "it has also been used to elaborate on utiyama s approach  @xcite . ) to us , the use of geometric algebra is as central to the theory of gravity presented here as tensor calculus and riemannian geometry were to einstein s development of general relativity .",
    "it is the language that most clearly exposes the structure of the theory .",
    "the equations take their simplest form when expressed in geometric algebra , and all reference to coordinates and frames is removed , achieving a clean separation between physical effects and coordinate artefacts . furthermore , the geometric algebra development of the theory is entirely self - contained .",
    "all problems can be treated without ever having to introduce concepts from other languages , such as differential forms or the newman ",
    "penrose formalism .",
    "we realise , however , that the use of an unfamiliar language may deter some readers from exploring the main physical content of our theory  which is of course independent of the language chosen to express it .",
    "we have therefore endeavoured to keep the mathematical content of the main text to a minimum level , and have included appendices describing methods for translating our equations into the more familiar languages of tensor and spinor calculus .",
    "in addition , many of the final equations required for applications are simple scalar equations .",
    "the role of geometric algebra is simply to provide the most efficient and transparent derivation of these equations .",
    "it is our hope that physicists will find geometric algebra a simpler and more natural language than that of differential geometry and tensor calculus .",
    "this paper starts with an introduction to geometric algebra and its spacetime version  the spacetime algebra .",
    "we then turn to the gauging arguments outlined above and find mathematical expressions of the underlying principles .",
    "this leads to the introduction of two gauge fields . at this point",
    "the discussion is made concrete by turning to the dirac action integral .",
    "the dirac action is formulated in such a way that internal phase rotations and spacetime rotations take equivalent forms .",
    "gauge fields are then minimally coupled to the dirac field to enforce invariance under local displacements and both spacetime and phase rotations .",
    "we then turn to the construction of a lagrangian density for the gravitational gauge fields .",
    "this leads to a surprising conclusion .",
    "the demand that the gravitational action be consistent with the derivation of the minimally - coupled dirac equation restricts us to a single action integral .",
    "the only freedom that remains is the possible inclusion of a cosmological constant , which can not be ruled out on theoretical grounds alone .",
    "the result of this work is a set of field equations that are completely independent of how we choose to label the positions of fields with a vector @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting theory is conceptually simple and easier to calculate with than the metric - based theory of general relativity .",
    "we call this theory ` _ _ gauge theory gravity _ _ ' ( gtg ) .",
    "having derived the field equations , we turn to a discussion of measurements , the equivalence principle and the newtonian limit in gtg .",
    "we end part  i with a discussion of symmetries , invariants and conservation laws .    in part",
    "ii we turn to applications , concentrating mainly on time - dependent spherically - symmetric systems .",
    "we start by studying perfect fluids and derive a simple set of first - order equations that describe a wide range of physical phenomena .",
    "the method of derivation of these equations is new and offers many advantages over conventional techniques .",
    "the equations are then studied in the contexts of black holes , collapsing matter and cosmology .",
    "we show how a gauge can be chosen that affords a clear , global picture of the properties of these systems . indeed , in many cases one can apply simple ,",
    "almost newtonian , reasoning to understand the physics .",
    "for some of these applications the predictions of gtg and general relativity are identical , and these cases include all present experimental tests of general relativity . however , on matters such as the role of horizons and topology , the two theories differ .",
    "for example , we show that the black - hole solutions admitted in gtg fall into two distinct time - asymmetric gauge sectors , and that one of these is picked out uniquely by the formation process .",
    "this is quite different to general relativity , which admits eternal time - reverse symmetric solutions . in discussing differences between gtg and general relativity , it is not always clear what the correct general relativistic viewpoint is",
    ". we should therefore be explicit in stating that what we intend when we talk about general relativity is the full , modern formulation of the subject as expounded by , for example , hawking  & ellis  @xcite and dinverno  @xcite .",
    "this includes ideas such as worm - holes , exotic topologies and distinct ` universes ' connected by black holes  @xcite .    after studying some solutions for the gravitational fields we turn to the properties of electromagnetic and dirac fields in gravitational backgrounds .",
    "for example , we give field configurations for a charge held at rest outside a black hole . we show how these field lines extend smoothly across the horizon , and that the origin behaves as a polarisation charge .",
    "this solution demonstrates how the global properties of the gravitational fields are relevant to physics outside the horizon , a fact that is supported by an analysis of the dirac equation in a black - hole background .",
    "this analysis also provides a quick , though physically questionable , derivation of a particle production rate described by a fermi  dirac distribution with the correct hawking temperature .",
    "we end with a discussion of the implications of gauge - theory gravity for cosmology .",
    "a study of the maxwell and dirac equations in a cosmological background reveals a number of surprising features .",
    "in particular , it is shown that a non - spatially - flat universe does not appear homogeneous to dirac fields  fermionic matter would be able to detect the ` centre ' of the universe if @xmath1 .",
    "thus the only homogeneous cosmological models consistent with gtg are those that are spatially flat .",
    "( this does not rule out spatially - flat universes with a non - zero cosmological constant . )",
    "a concluding section summarises the philosophy behind our approach , and outlines some future areas of research .",
    "there are many reasons for preferring geometric algebra to other languages employed in mathematical physics .",
    "it is the most powerful and efficient language for handling rotations and boosts ; it generalises the role of complex numbers in two dimensions , and quaternions in three dimensions , to a scheme that efficiently handles rotations in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "it also exploits the advantages of labelling points with vectors more fully than either tensor calculus or differential forms , both of which were designed with a view to applications in the intrinsic geometry of curved spaces .",
    "in addition , geometric algebra affords an entirely _ real _ formulation of the dirac equation  @xcite , eliminating the need for complex numbers .",
    "the advantage of the real formulation is that internal phase rotations and spacetime rotations are handled in an identical manner in a single unifying framework . a wide class of physical theories",
    "have now been successfully formulated in terms of geometric algebra .",
    "these include classical mechanics  @xcite , relativistic dynamics  @xcite , dirac theory  @xcite , electromagnetism and electrodynamics  @xcite , as well as a number of other areas of modern mathematical physics  @xcite . in every case",
    ", geometric algebra has offered demonstrable advantages over other techniques and has provided novel insights and unifications between disparate branches of physics and mathematics .",
    "this section is intended to give only a brief introduction to the ideas and applications of geometric algebra .",
    "a fuller introduction , including a number of results relevant to this paper , is set out in the series of papers  @xcite written by the present authors .",
    "elsewhere , the books by doran  & lasenby  @xcite , hestenes  @xcite and hestenes  & sobczyk  @xcite cover the subject in detail .",
    "a number of other helpful introductory articles can be found , including those by hestenes  @xcite , vold  @xcite , and doran & lasenby  @xcite .",
    "the conference proceedings  @xcite also contain some interesting and useful papers .",
    "geometric algebra arose from clifford s attempts to generalise hamilton s quaternion algebra into a language for vectors in arbitrary dimensions  @xcite .",
    "clifford discovered that both complex numbers and quaternions are special cases of an algebraic framework in which vectors are equipped with a single associative product that is distributive over addition . with vectors represented by lower - case roman letters ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , clifford s ` geometric product '",
    "is written simply as @xmath4 .",
    "a key feature of the geometric product is that the square of any vector is a scalar .",
    "now , rearranging the expansion @xmath5 to give @xmath6 where the right - hand side of   is a sum of squares and by assumption a scalar , we see that the symmetric part of the geometric product of two vectors is also a scalar .",
    "we write this ` inner ' or ` dot ' product between vectors as @xmath7 the remaining antisymmetric part of the the geometric product represents the directed area swept out by displacing @xmath2 along @xmath3 .",
    "this is the ` outer ' or ` exterior ' product introduced by grassmann  @xcite and familiar to all who have studied the language of differential forms .",
    "the outer product of two vectors is called a _ bivector _ and is written with a wedge : @xmath8    on combining   and   we find that the geometric product has been decomposed into the sum of a scalar and a bivector part , @xmath9 the innovative feature of clifford s product   lies in its mixing of two different types of object : scalars and bivectors .",
    "this is not problematic , because the addition implied by   is precisely that which is used when a real number is added to an imaginary number to form a complex number . but why might we want to add these two geometrically distinct objects ?",
    "the answer emerges from considering reflections and rotations .",
    "suppose that the vector @xmath2 is reflected in the ( hyper)plane perpendicular to the unit vector @xmath10 .",
    "the result is the new vector @xmath11 the utility of the geometric algebra form of the resultant vector , @xmath12 , becomes clear when a second reflection is performed .",
    "if this second reflection is in the hyperplane perpendicular to the unit vector @xmath13 , then the combined effect is @xmath14 but the combined effect of two reflections is a rotation so , defining the geometric product @xmath15 as the scalar - plus - bivector quantity @xmath16 , we see that rotations are represented by @xmath17 here the quantity @xmath18 is called the ` _ reverse _ ' of @xmath16 and is obtained by reversing the order of all geometric products between vectors : @xmath19 the object @xmath16",
    "is called a _",
    "rotor_. rotors can be written as an even ( geometric ) product of unit vectors , and satisfy the relation @xmath20 .",
    "the representation of rotations in the form   has many advantages over tensor techniques . by defining @xmath21",
    "we can write @xmath22 which relates the rotor @xmath16 directly to the plane in which the rotation takes place .",
    "equation   generalises to arbitrary dimensions the representation of planar rotations afforded by complex numbers .",
    "this generalisation provides a good example of how the full geometric product , and the implied sum of objects of different types , can enter geometry at a very basic level .",
    "the fact that equation   encapsulates a simple geometric relation should also dispel the notion that clifford algebras are somehow intrinsically ` quantum ' in origin .",
    "the derivation of   has assumed nothing about the signature of the space being employed , so that the formula applies equally to boosts as well as rotations . the two - sided formula for a rotation   will also turn out to be compatible with the manner in which observables are constructed from dirac spinors , and this is important for the gauge theory of rotations of the dirac equation which follows .",
    "forming further geometric products of vectors produces the entire geometric algebra .",
    "general elements are called ` multivectors ' and these decompose into sums of elements of different grades ( scalars are grade zero , vectors grade one , bivectors grade two _ etc .",
    "multivectors in which all elements have the same grade are termed _ homogeneous _ and are usually written as @xmath23 to show that @xmath24 contains only grade-@xmath25 components .",
    "multivectors inherit an associative product , and the geometric product of a grade-@xmath25 multivector @xmath23 with a grade-@xmath26 multivector @xmath27 decomposes into @xmath28 where the symbol @xmath29 denotes the projection onto the grade-@xmath25 component of @xmath30 .",
    "the projection onto the grade-0 ( scalar ) component of @xmath30 is written @xmath31 .",
    "the ` @xmath32 ' and ` @xmath33 ' symbols are retained for the lowest - grade and highest - grade terms of the series  , so that @xmath34 which are called the interior and exterior products respectively . the exterior product is associative , and satisfies the symmetry property @xmath35    two further products can also be defined from the geometric product .",
    "these are the scalar product @xmath36 and the commutator product @xmath37 the scalar product   is commutative and satisfies the cyclic reordering property @xmath38 the scalar product   and the interior product   coincide when acting on two homogeneous multivectors of the same grade .",
    "the associativity of the geometric product ensures that the commutator product satisfies the jacobi identity @xmath39    finally we introduce some further conventions .",
    "throughout we employ the operator ordering convention that , _ in the absence of brackets , inner , outer , commutator and scalar products take precedence over geometric products_. thus @xmath40 means @xmath41 , not @xmath42 .",
    "this convention helps to eliminate unwieldy numbers of brackets .",
    "summation convention is employed throughout , except for indices that denote the grade of a multivector , which are not summed over .",
    "natural units ( @xmath43 ) are used except where explicitly stated . throughout",
    "we refer to a lorentz transformation ( _ i.e. _ a spatial rotation and/or boost ) simply as a ` rotation ' .",
    "of central importance to this paper is the geometric algebra of spacetime , the _ spacetime algebra _  @xcite . to describe the spacetime algebra it is helpful to introduce a set of four orthonormal basis vectors @xmath44 , @xmath45 ,",
    "satisfying @xmath46 the vectors @xmath44 satisfy the same algebraic relations as dirac s @xmath47-matrices , but they now form a set of four independent basis vectors for spacetime , not four components of a single vector in an internal ` spin - space ' . the relation between dirac s matrix algebra and the spacetime algebra",
    "is described in more detail in appendix  [ app - dirac ] , which gives a direct translation of the dirac equation into its spacetime algebra form .",
    "a frame of timelike bivectors @xmath48 , @xmath49 is defined by @xmath50 and forms an orthonormal frame of vectors in the space relative to the @xmath51 direction .",
    "the algebraic properties of the @xmath48 are the same as those of the pauli spin matrices , but they now represent an orthonormal frame of vectors in space , and not three components of a vector in spin - space .",
    "the highest - grade element ( or ` pseudoscalar ' ) is denoted by @xmath52 and is defined as : @xmath53 the pseudoscalar satisfies @xmath54 . since we are in a space of even dimension , @xmath52 _ anti_commutes with odd - grade elements , and commutes only with even - grade elements . with these definitions , a basis for the 16-dimensional spacetime algebra is provided by @xmath55    geometric significance is attached to the above relations as follows .",
    "an observer s rest frame is characterised by a future - pointing timelike ( unit ) vector .",
    "if this is chosen to be the @xmath51 direction then the @xmath51-vector determines a map between spacetime vectors @xmath56 and the even subalgebra of the spacetime algebra via @xmath57 the ` relative vector ' @xmath58 can be decomposed in the @xmath48 frame and represents a spatial vector as seen by an observer in the @xmath51-frame .",
    "since a vector appears to an observer as a line segment existing for a period of time , it is natural that what an observer perceives as a vector should be represented by a spacetime bivector .",
    "equation   embodies this idea , and shows that the algebraic properties of vectors in relative space are determined entirely by the properties of the fully relativistic spacetime algebra .",
    "the split of the six spacetime bivectors into relative vectors and relative bivectors is a frame - dependent operation  different observers see different relative spaces .",
    "this fact is clearly illustrated with the faraday bivector @xmath59 .",
    "the ` space - time split '  @xcite of @xmath59 into the @xmath51-system is made by separating @xmath59 into parts that anticommute and commute with @xmath51 .",
    "thus @xmath60 both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are spatial vectors in the @xmath51-frame , and @xmath63 is a spatial bivector .",
    "equation   decomposes @xmath59 into separate electric and magnetic fields , and the explicit appearance of @xmath51 in the formulae for @xmath61 and @xmath62 shows how this split is observer - dependent .",
    "the identification of the algebra of three - dimensional space with the even subalgebra of the spacetime algebra necessitates a convention that articulates smoothly between the two algebras .",
    "for this reason relative ( or spatial ) vectors in the @xmath51-system are written in bold type to record the fact that they are in fact spacetime bivectors .",
    "this distinguishes them from spacetime vectors , which are left in normal type .",
    "further conventions are introduced where necessary .",
    "many of the derivations in this paper employ the vector and multivector derivatives  @xcite . before defining these , however , we need some simple results for vector frames .",
    "suppose that the set @xmath64 form a vector frame .",
    "the reciprocal frame is determined by  @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 and the check on @xmath67 denotes that this term is missing from the expression .",

    "the derivative of @xmath59 with respect to @xmath72 in the @xmath24 direction is defined by @xmath74 from this the multivector derivative @xmath75 is defined by @xmath76 this definition shows how the multivector derivative @xmath75 inherits the multivector properties of its argument @xmath72 , as well as a calculus from equation  .",
    "most of the properties of the multivector derivative follow from the result that @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the projection of @xmath24 onto the grades contained in @xmath72 .",
    "leibniz rule is then used to build up results for more complicated functions ( see appendix  [ app - results ] ) .",
    "the multivector derivative acts on the next object to its right unless brackets are present ; for example in the expression @xmath79 the @xmath75 acts only on @xmath24 , but in the expression @xmath80 the @xmath75 acts on both @xmath24 and @xmath70 . if the @xmath75 is intended to act only on @xmath70 then this is written as @xmath81 , the overdot denoting the multivector on which the derivative acts . as an illustration , leibniz rule can be written in the form @xmath82 the overdot notation neatly encodes the fact that , since @xmath75 is a multivector , it does not necessarily commute with other multivectors and often acts on functions to which it is not adjacent .",
    "we frequently make use of the derivative with respect to a general vector to perform a range of linear algebra operations . for such operations",

    "the basic idea is that all physical relations should have the generic form @xmath109 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are spacetime fields representing physical quantities , and @xmath0 is the spacetime position vector .",
    "an equality such as this can certainly correspond to a clear physical statement .",
    "but , considered as a relation between fields , the physical relationship expressed by this statement is completely independent of where we choose to think of @xmath0 as lying in spacetime . in particular , we can associate each position @xmath0 with some new position @xmath110 and rewrite the relation as @xmath111 , and the equation still has precisely the same content .",
    "( a proviso , which will gain significance later , is that the map @xmath112 should be non - singular and cover all of spacetime . )",
    "a similar argument applies to rotations .",
    "the _ intrinsic _ content of a relation such as @xmath109 at a given point @xmath113 is unchanged if we rotate each of @xmath2 and @xmath3 by the same amount .",
    "that is , the equation @xmath114 has the same physical content as the equation @xmath115 .",
    "for example scalar product relations , from which we can derive angles , are unaffected by this change .",
    "these arguments apply to any physical relation between any type of multivector field .",
    "the principles underlying gauge theory gravity can therefore be summarised as follows :    the physical content of a field equation must be invariant under arbitrary local displacements of the fields .",
    "( this is called position - gauge invariance . )",
    "the physical content of a field equation must be invariant under arbitrary local rotations of the fields .",
    "( this is called rotation - gauge invariance . )    in this theory predictions for all measurable quantities , including distances and angles , must be derived from gauge - invariant relations between the field quantities themselves , not from the properties of the background spacetime . on the other hand , quantities that depend on a choice of ` gauge ' are not predicted absolutely and can not be defined operationally .",
    "it is necessary to indicate how this approach differs from the one adopted in gauge theories of the poincar group .",
    "( this is a point on which we have been confused in the past  @xcite . )",
    "poincar transformations for a multivector field @xmath116 are defined by @xmath117 where @xmath118 @xmath16 is a constant rotor and @xmath119 is a constant vector .",
    "transformations of this type mix displacements and rotations , and any attempt at a local gauging of this spacetime symmetry fails to decouple the two  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the rotations described by poincar transformations include the displacement   ( with @xmath120 ) means that the rotations discussed under point  ( ii ) above are not contained in the poincar group .    as a final introductory point , while the mapping of fields onto spacetime positions is arbitrary , the fields themselves must be well - defined .",
    "the fields can not be singular except at a few special points .",
    "furthermore , any remapping of the fields in the must be one - to - one , else we would cut out some region of physical significance . in later sections we will see that general relativity allows operations in which regions of spacetime are removed .",
    "these are achieved through the use of singular coordinate transformations and are the origin of some potential differences between gtg and general relativity .",
    "we now examine the consequences of the local symmetries we have just discussed . as in all gauge theories",
    "we must study the effects on _ derivatives _ , since all non - derivative relations already satisfy the correct requirements .",
    "we start by considering a scalar field @xmath121 and form its vector derivative @xmath122 .",
    "suppose now that from @xmath121 we define the new field @xmath123 by @xmath124 and @xmath112 is an arbitrary ( differentiable ) map between spacetime position vectors .",
    "the map @xmath112 should not be thought of as a map between manifolds , or as moving points around ; rather , the function @xmath112 is merely a rule for relating one position vector to another within a single vector space .",
    "note that the new function @xmath123 is given by the old function @xmath125 evaluated at @xmath126 . we could have defined things the other way round , so that @xmath127 is given by @xmath121 , but the form adopted here turns out to be easier to implement in practice .",
    "if we now act on the new scalar field @xmath128 with @xmath88 we form the quantity @xmath129 . to evaluate this we first look at the directional derivatives of @xmath128 , @xmath130 where @xmath131 and the subscript on @xmath132 records that the derivative is now with respect to the new vector position variable @xmath126 .",
    "the function @xmath95 is a linear function of @xmath2 and an arbitrary function of @xmath0 . if we wish to make the position - dependence explicit we write this as @xmath133 . in general , any position - dependent linear function with its",
    "position - dependence suppressed is to be taken as a function of @xmath0 . also  as stated previously  the argument of a linear function should be assumed to be constant unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "from   we see that @xmath134 and it follows that @xmath135 the bracketed term on the right - hand side , @xmath136 , is the old gradient vector @xmath137 evaluated at @xmath126 instead of @xmath0 .",
    "this tells us how to modify the derivative operator @xmath88 : we must introduce a new linear function that assembles with @xmath88 in such a way that the @xmath106 field is removed when the full object is displaced .",
    "the resulting object will then have the desired property of just changing its position dependence under arbitrary local displacements .",
    "we therefore introduce the _ position - gauge field _",
    "@xmath138 , which is a linear function of @xmath2 and an arbitrary function of position @xmath0 . as usual",
    "this is abbreviated to @xmath139 when the position - dependence is taken as a function of @xmath0 . under the displacement @xmath140 , @xmath139 is defined to transform to the new field @xmath141 , where @xmath142 this ensures that @xmath143 transforms as @xmath144 this transformation law ensures that , if we define a vector @xmath145 by @xmath146 then @xmath145 transforms simply as @xmath147 under _ arbitrary _ displacements .",
    "this is the type of behaviour we seek .",
    "the vector @xmath145 can now be equated with other ( possibly non - differentiated ) fields and the resulting equations are unchanged in form under arbitrary repositioning of the fields in spacetime .",
    "henceforth , we refer to any quantity that transforms under arbitrary displacements as @xmath148 as behaving _ covariantly _ under displacements .",
    "the position gauge field @xmath149 enables us to form derivatives of covariant objects which are also covariant under displacements .",
    "when we come to calculate with this theory , we will often fix a gauge by choosing a labelling of spacetime points with vectors . in this way we remain free to exploit all the advantages of representing points with vectors .",
    "of course , all physical predictions of the theory will remain independent of the actual gauge choice .",
    "the @xmath149-field is not a connection in the conventional yang ",
    "mills sense .",
    "the coupling to derivatives is different , as is the transformation law  .",
    "this is unsurprising , since the group of arbitrary translations is infinite - dimensional ( if we were considering maps between manifolds then this would form the group of diffeomorphisms ) .",
    "nevertheless the @xmath149-field embodies the idea of replacing directional derivatives with covariant derivatives , so clearly deserves to be called a gauge field .",
    "a remaining question is to find the conditions under which the @xmath149-field can be transformed to the identity",
    ". this would be the case if @xmath149 was derived entirely from a displacement , which would imply that @xmath150 and hence @xmath151 but , from the definition of @xmath95 , it follows that @xmath152 and hence that @xmath153 so , if the @xmath139 field can be transformed to the identity , it must satisfy @xmath154 an arbitrary @xmath149-field will not satisfy this equation , so in general there is no way to assign position vectors so that the effects of the @xmath149-field vanish . in the light of equations   and   it might seem more natural to introduce the gauge field as @xmath155 , instead of @xmath143 .",
    "there is little to choose between these conventions , though our choice is partially justified by our later implementation of the variational principle .",
    "we now examine how the derivative must be modified to allow rotational freedom from point to point , as described in point  ( ii ) at the start of this section . here",
    "we give an analysis based on the properties of classical fields . an analysis based on spinor fields",
    "is given in the following section .",
    "we have already seen that the gradient of a scalar field is modified to @xmath156 to achieve covariance under displacements . but",
    "objects such as temperature gradients are certainly physical , and can be equated with other physical quantities .",
    "consequently vectors such as @xmath156 must transform under rotations in the same manner as all other physical fields .",
    "it follows that , under local spacetime rotations , the @xmath149-field must transform as @xmath157 now consider an equation such as maxwell s equation , which we saw in section  [ o - gc ] takes the simple spacetime algebra form @xmath158 .",
    "once the position - gauge field is introduced , this equation becomes @xmath159 where @xmath160 ( the reasons behind these definitions will be explained in section  [ max ] . the use of a calligraphic letter for certain covariant fields is a convention we have found very useful . ) the definitions of @xmath161 and @xmath162 ensure that under local rotations they transform as @xmath163 any ( multi)vector that transforms in this manner under rotations and is covariant under displacements is referred to as a _ covariant _",
    "( multi)vector .",
    "equation   is covariant under arbitrary displacements , and we now need to make it covariant under local rotations as well . to achieve this we replace @xmath143 by @xmath164 and focus attention on the term @xmath165 . under a position - dependent rotation",
    "we find that @xmath166 since the rotor @xmath16 satisfies @xmath20 we find that @xmath167 hence @xmath168 is equal to minus its reverse and so must be a bivector .",
    "( in a geometric algebra the bivectors form a representation of the lie algebra of the rotation group  @xcite . )",
    "we can therefore write @xmath169 to construct a covariant derivative we must therefore add a connection term to @xmath170 to construct the operator @xmath171 here @xmath172 is a bivector - valued linear function . to make the linear argument explicit we write @xmath173 so that @xmath174 is a linear function of @xmath2 with an arbitrary @xmath0-dependence .",
    "the commutator product of a multivector with a bivector is grade - preserving so , even though it contains non - scalar terms , @xmath175 preserves the grade of the multivector on which it acts .    under local rotations",
    "the @xmath170 term in @xmath175 can not change , and we also expect that the @xmath175 operator be unchanged in form ( this is the essence of ` minimal coupling ' ) .",
    "we should therefore have @xmath176 but the property that the covariant derivative must satisfy is @xmath177 and , substituting   into this equation , we find that @xmath172 transforms as @xmath178 in coordinate - free form we can write this transformation law as @xmath179 of course , since @xmath180 is an arbitrary function of position , it can not in general be transformed away by the application of a rotor .",
    "we finally reassemble the derivative   with the @xmath181 term to form the equation @xmath182 the transformation properties of @xmath139 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath180 ensure that this equation is now covariant under rotations as well as displacements .    to complete the set of transformation laws , we note that under displacements @xmath180 must transform in the same way as @xmath183 , so that @xmath184 it follows that @xmath185 as required for covariance under local translations .",
    "general considerations have led us to the introduction of two new gauge fields : vector - valued linear function @xmath138 and the bivector - valued linear function @xmath186 , both of which are arbitrary functions of position @xmath0 .",
    "this gives a total of @xmath187 scalar degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath139 and @xmath180 fields are incorporated into the vector derivative to form the operator @xmath188 , which acts covariantly on multivector fields .",
    "thus we can begin to construct equations whose intrinsic content is free of the manner in which we represent spacetime positions with vectors .",
    "we next see how these fields arise in the setting of the dirac theory .",
    "this enables us to derive the properties of the @xmath175 operator from more primitive considerations of the properties of spinors and the means by which observables are constructed from them .",
    "first , though , let us compare the fields that we have defined with the fields used conventionally in general relativity . to do this , we first construct the vectors",
    "@xmath189 from these , the metric is defined by @xmath190 note that the inner product here is the standard spacetime algebra inner product and is not related to a curved space metric . similarly , the @xmath149-field can be used to construct a _ vierbein _",
    ", as discussed in appendix  c. a vierbein in general relativity relates a coordinate frame to an orthonormal frame .",
    "but , while the @xmath149-field can be used to construct such a vierbein , it should be clear that it serves a different purpose in gtg  it ensures covariance under arbitrary displacements .",
    "this was the motivation for the introduction of a vierbein in kibble s work  @xcite , although only infinitesimal transformations could be considered there .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath149-field is essential to enable a clean separation between field rotations and displacements , which again is not achieved in other approaches .",
    "we now rederive the gravitational gauge fields from symmetries of the dirac action .",
    "the point here is that , once the @xmath149-field is introduced , spacetime rotations and phase rotations couple to the dirac field in essentially the same way . to see this , we start with the dirac equation and dirac action in a slightly unconventional form  @xcite .",
    "we saw in section  [ outline ] that rotation of a multivector is performed by the double - sided application of a rotor .",
    "the elements of a linear space that is closed under single - sided action of a representation of the rotor group are called _",
    "spinors_. in conventional developments a matrix representation for the clifford algebra of spacetime is introduced , and the space of column vectors on which these matrices act defines the spin - space .",
    "but there is no need to adopt such a construction .",
    "for example , the even subalgebra of the spacetime algebra forms a linear space that is closed under single - sided application of the rotor group .",
    "the even subalgebra is also an eight - dimensional linear space , the same number of real dimensions as a dirac spinor , and so it is not surprising that a one - to - one map between dirac spinors and the even subalgebra can be constructed .",
    "such a map is given in appendix  a. the essential details are that the result of multiplying the column spinor @xmath191 by the dirac matrix @xmath192 is represented in the spacetime algebra as @xmath193 , and that multiplication by the scalar unit imaginary is represented as @xmath194 .",
    "it is easily seen that these two operations commute and that they map even multivectors to even multivectors . by replacing dirac matrices and column spinors by their spacetime algebra",
    "equivalents the dirac equation can be written in the form @xmath195 which is now representation - free and coordinate - free . using the same replacements , the free - particle dirac action becomes @xmath196 and , with the techniques of appendix  [ app - results ] , it is simple to verify that variation of this action with respect to @xmath197 yields equation   with @xmath24=0 .",
    "it is important to appreciate that the fixed @xmath51 and @xmath198 vectors in   and   do not pick out preferred directions in space .",
    "these vectors can be rotated to new vectors @xmath199 and @xmath200 , and replacing the spinor by @xmath201 recovers the same equation  .",
    "this point will be returned to when we discuss forming observables from the spinor @xmath197 .",
    "our aim now is to introduce gauge fields into the action   to ensure invariance under arbitrary rotations and displacements .",
    "the first step is to introduce the @xmath149-field . under a displacement @xmath197 transforms covariantly , @xmath202 where @xmath110 .",
    "we must therefore replace the @xmath88 operator by @xmath143 so that @xmath203 is also covariant under translations . but this on its own does not achieve complete invariance of the action integral   under displacements .",
    "the action consists of the integral of a scalar over some region .",
    "if the scalar is replaced by a displaced quantity , then we must also transform the measure and the boundary of the region if the resultant integral is to have the same value . transforming the boundary",
    "is easily done , but the measure does require a little work .",
    "suppose that we introduce a set of coordinates @xmath85 .",
    "the measure @xmath204 is then written @xmath205 where @xmath206 by definition , @xmath204 is already independent of the choice of coordinates , but it must be modified to make it position - gauge invariant . to see how , we note that under the displacement @xmath207 , the @xmath208 frame transforms to @xmath209 it follows that to ensure invariance of the action integral we must replace each of the @xmath210 by @xmath211 .",
    "thus the invariant scalar measure is @xmath212 these results lead us to the action @xmath213 which is unchanged in value if the dynamical fields are replaced by @xmath214 and the boundary is also transformed .",
    "having arrived at the action in the form of   we can now consider the effect of rotations applied at a point .",
    "the representation of spinors by even elements is now particularly powerful because it enables both internal phase rotations and rotations in space to be handled in the same unified framework . taking the electromagnetic coupling first",
    ", we see that the action   is invariant under the global phase rotation @xmath215 ( recall that multiplication of @xmath191 by the unit imaginary is represented by right - sided multiplication of @xmath197 by @xmath216 . )",
    "the transformation   is a special case of the more general transformation @xmath217 where @xmath16 is a constant rotor .",
    "similarly , invariance of the action   under spacetime rotations is described by @xmath218 in both cases , @xmath197 just picks up a single rotor . from the previous section",
    "we know that , when the rotor @xmath16 is position - dependent , the quantity @xmath219 is a bivector - valued linear function of @xmath210 . since @xmath220 with a similar result holding when the rotor acts from the right , we need the following covariant derivatives for local internal and external rotations : @xmath221 for the case of ( internal ) phase rotations , the rotations are constrained to take place entirely in the @xmath216 plane .",
    "it follows that the internal connection takes the restricted form @xmath222 where @xmath24 is the conventional electromagnetic vector potential and @xmath223 is the coupling constant ( the charge ) .",
    "the full covariant derivative therefore has the form @xmath224 and the full invariant action integral is now ( in coordinate - free form ) @xmath225 the action   is invariant under the symmetry transformations listed in table  [ g - dtab1 ] .",
    "c|cccc & +    .__the symmetries of the action integral  . _ _ [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     &     +   +    at first sight , the equations of table  [ cos - tab2 ] do not resemble the usual friedmann equations .",
    "the friedmann equations are recovered straightforwardly , however , by setting @xmath226 with this substitution we find that @xmath227 and that the @xmath228 and density equations become @xmath229 recovering the friedmann equations in their standard form  @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic treatment has therefore led us to work directly with the ` hubble velocity ' @xmath230 , rather than the ` distance ' scale @xmath231 .",
    "there is a good reason for this .",
    "once the weyl tensor is set to zero , the riemann tensor reduces to @xmath232 and we have now lost contact with an intrinsically - defined distance scale .",
    "we can therefore rescale the radius variable @xmath25 with an arbitrary function of @xmath119 ( or @xmath25 ) without altering the riemann tensor .",
    "the hubble velocity , on the other hand , is intrinsic and it is therefore not surprising that our treatment has led directly to equations for this .    among the class of radial rescalings a particularly useful one is to rescale @xmath25 to @xmath233 .",
    "this is achieved with the transformation @xmath234 so that , on applying equation  , the transformed @xmath149-function is @xmath235 the function   reproduces the standard line element used in cosmology .",
    "we can therefore use the transformation   to move between the ` newtonian ' gauge developed here and the gauge of  .",
    "this is useful for later sections , where the maxwell and dirac equations are solved in a cosmological background described by  .",
    "the differences between these gauges can be understood by considering geodesic motion .",
    "a particle at rest with respect to the cosmological frame ( defined by the cosmic microwave background ) has @xmath236 . in the gauge of   such",
    "a particle is not moving in the flatspace background ( the distance variable @xmath25 is equated with the comoving coordinate ) . in the newtonian gauge ,",
    "on the other hand , comoving particles are moving outwards radially at a velocity @xmath237 , though this expansion centre is not an intrinsic feature .",
    "of course , attempting to distinguish these pictures is a pointless exercise , since all observables must be gauge - invariant .",
    "all that is of physical relevance is that , if two particles are at rest with respect to the cosmological frame ( defined by the cosmic microwave background ) , then the light - travel time between these particles is an increasing function of time and light is redshifted as it travels between them .",
    "the utility of the newtonian gauge in cosmology has been independently discovered by other authors  @xcite .",
    "here we illustrate its advantages for dust models ( @xmath238 ) . setting @xmath239 to zero implies that @xmath240",
    "so @xmath241 and @xmath242 we are therefore left with a single first - order differential equation for @xmath243 .",
    "explicit solutions of this equations are often not needed , as we can usually parameterise time by the density @xmath244 .    if we now look at the trajectories defined by the fluid , these have @xmath245 which implies that @xmath246 it follows that @xmath247 and hence that @xmath248 the fluid streamlines form a family of spacetime curves spreading out from the origin at the initial singularity ( when @xmath249 ) .",
    "the newtonian gauge therefore describes an expanding universe in a very simple , almost naive manner .",
    "since all points in a homogeneous cosmology are equivalent , we can consider ourselves to be located at @xmath250 .",
    "the newtonian gauge then pictures our observable universe as a ball of dust expanding outwards radially from us .",
    "while the picture provided by the newtonian gauge has no physical reality of its own , it does have some heuristic merit and can provide a useful aid to one s physical intuition .",
    "for example , consider the familiar relationship between angular size and redshift .",
    "an initially surprising feature of this relationship is that , beyond a certain redshift , angular sizes stop decreasing and start increasing .",
    "this result is easily understood in the newtonian gauge .",
    "consider the photon paths shown in figure  [ cos - fig1 ] .",
    "( these paths are for a @xmath251 and @xmath252 universe , though the comments are applicable more generally . )",
    "suppose that at some finite time @xmath253 we receive a photon from the distant past .",
    "this photon must have followed part of a path which begins on the origin at @xmath120 . before a certain time in the past , therefore , photons received by us must have initially travelled outwards before turning round and reaching us .",
    "the angular size of an observed object is then that appropriate to the actual @xmath25 coordinate of the object when it emitted the photons . since the value of @xmath25 decreases before a certain time , angular sizes appear larger for objects that emitted photons before this time .",
    "a radial null geodesic has a trajectory @xmath254 for these trajectories @xmath255 and the condition that @xmath256 reduces to @xmath257 since @xmath230 is positive in a cooling universe , the distance at which photons ` turn round ' is defined by @xmath258 ( in  @xcite we mistakenly referred to this distance as a particle horizon . ) for @xmath259 it is simple to show that this distance corresponds to a redshift of @xmath260 .",
    "this result relates physically measurable quantities , so is gauge invariant .",
    "the newtonian gauge presents a particularly simple picture for a closed universe ( @xmath261 ) .",
    "for @xmath261 the requirement that @xmath262 is positive means that @xmath263 this places a limit on the speed with which the dust can expand , so the solution describes a finite ball of dust expanding into a vacuum .",
    "this ball expands out to some fixed radius before turning round and contracting back to the origin .",
    "the turning point is achieved where @xmath264 so , for @xmath252 , this occurs when @xmath265 the maximum radius is therefore @xmath266 the time taken to reach the future singularity is given by  , since this cosmological model is a special case of spherical collapse in which the density is uniform .",
    "this picture of a model for a closed universe is both simple and appealing .",
    "it allows us to apply newtonian reasoning while ensuring consistency with the full relativistic theory .",
    "the finite ball model for a @xmath261 cosmology is clearly useful when considering experiments with particles carried out near the origin , but globally one must consider the boundary properties of the ball .",
    "a crucial question is whether the particle horizon ( the largest region of the universe with which an observer at the origin is in causal contact ) extends past the edge of the ball or not .",
    "it can be shown that this horizon always lies inside the radius at which @xmath267 becomes imaginary , except at the turnaround point ( the point at which the ball reaches its maximum radius ) , where the two radii coincide .",
    "a suitable choice of cutoff radius is therefore available in either the expanding or contracting phase separately , but what happens at the turnaround point is potentially ambiguous . when discussing field theory , however , the finite ball model is inadequate .",
    "one must instead use a global gauge so , in section  [ max - cos ] , we introduce the ` stereographic projection gauge ' .",
    "this provides a global solution which can be shown to be spatially closed .",
    "this solution is used in the study of electromagnetism ( section  [ max - cos ] ) and the dirac equation ( section  [ de - cos ] ) in a cosmological background .",
    "it is possible to treat the stereographic projection gauge solution in a form of the newtonian gauge , though this possibility is not explored here .",
    "in section  [ field ] we derived field equations for the gravitational and dirac fields .",
    "we now turn to the derivation of the maxwell equations in a gravitational background . a number of applications of these equations",
    "are then discussed , including a simple derivation of the characteristic surfaces for both the maxwell and dirac equations .",
    "the basic dynamical variable is the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath24 , for which the coupling to spinor fields was derived in section  [ g - dirac ] . under phase rotations of the spinor field , @xmath24 transforms as @xmath268 it follows that , under a displacement , @xmath24 must transform in the same way as @xmath137 , that is , @xmath269 the covariant form of the vector potential is therefore @xmath270 which is the term that appeared in the dirac equation  .    from @xmath24 , the faraday bivector @xmath59",
    "is defined by @xmath271 this definition implies that , under displacements , @xmath272 is transformed to @xmath273 , where @xmath274 it follows that the covariant analogue of @xmath59 is defined by @xmath275 which is covariant under position and rotation - gauge transformations , and is invariant under phase changes .    the same covariant quantity @xmath161 is obtained if one follows the route used for the construction of @xmath276 at  .",
    "in particular , the contracted commutator of two covariant derivatives gives ( in the absence of torsion ) @xmath277",

    "does not appear in this action .",
    "it follows that the electromagnetic field does not act as a source of spin .",
    "the action   is varied with respect to @xmath24 , with @xmath139 and @xmath162 treated as external fields .",
    "the result of this is the equation @xmath282 where @xmath283 equation   combines with the identity @xmath284 to form the full set of maxwell equations in a gravitational background .",

    "many phenomena , including the bending of light , can be understood easily in terms of the properties of the dielectric defined by the @xmath149-field .",
    "so far we have failed to achieve a manifestly covariant form of the maxwell equations .",
    "we have , furthermore , failed to unite the separate equations into a single equation . in the absence of gravitational effects the equations @xmath291 and @xmath292 combine into the single equation @xmath293 the significance of this equation is that the @xmath88 operator is invertible , whereas the separate @xmath93 and @xmath94 operators are not  @xcite .",
    "clearly , we expect that such a unification should remain possible after the gravitational gauge fields have been introduced . to find a covariant equation , we first extend the ` wedge ' equation   to include higher - grade terms . to make the derivation general we include the spin term , in which case we find that @xmath294 and , more generally , we can write @xmath295 we can therefore replace equation   by @xmath296 we next use the rearrangement @xmath297 to write equation   as @xmath298 equations   and   now combine into the single equation @xmath299 which achieves our objective .",
    "equation   is manifestly covariant and the appearance of the @xmath300 term is precisely what one might expect on ` minimal - coupling ' grounds .",
    "the appearance of the spin term is a surprise , however .",
    "gauge arguments alone would not have discovered this term and it is only through the construction of a gauge - invariant action integral that the term is found .",
    "equation   should be particularly useful when considering electromagnetic effects in regions of high spin density , such as neutron stars .    to complete the description of electromagnetism in a gravitational background",

    "we have now seen that gravitational interactions modify both these equations in such a way that the vector derivative @xmath88 is replaced by the position - gauge covariant derivative @xmath143 . as an illustration of the utility of first - order equations , both without and with gravitational effects",
    ", we now give a simple derivation of the properties of characteristic surfaces .",
    "consider , initially , a generic equation of the type @xmath304 where @xmath197 is some arbitrary field , and @xmath305 is some known function .",
    "suppose that an initial set of data is given over some three - dimensional surface in spacetime , and we wish to propagate this information off the surface into the adjoining region .",
    "we pick three vectors , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath306 , which are tangent to the surface . from our initial data",
    "we can construct @xmath307 , @xmath308 and @xmath309 . now define @xmath310 and use @xmath311 to decompose   into @xmath312 the right - hand side of   contains the term @xmath313 which is therefore known .",
    "it follows that we know all the terms on the right - hand side of equation   and can therefore construct @xmath314 .",
    "this gives us the derivative required to propagate off the surface .",
    "the only situation for which propagation is impossible is when @xmath10 remains in the surface .",
    "this occurs when @xmath315 it follows that the characteristic surfaces for any first - order equation of the type defined by   are null surfaces .",
    "these considerations automatically include the maxwell and dirac equations .",
    "it is notable how this result follows from purely algebraic considerations .",
    "the generalisation to a gravitational background is straightforward .",
    "equation is generalised to @xmath316 and we assume that a gauge choice has been made so that all the fields ( apart from @xmath197 ) are known functions of @xmath0 .",
    "again , we assume that the initial data consist of values for @xmath197 over some three - dimensional surface , so we can still determine @xmath307 _ etc . _ since @xmath317 it follows that the vector of interest is now @xmath318 this time we multiply equation   by @xmath319 and find that @xmath320 can be constructed entirely from known quantities",
    ". we can therefore propagate in the @xmath321 direction , so we now require that this vector does not lie in the initial surface .",
    "the analogue of   is therefore @xmath322 and the characteristic surfaces are now those for which @xmath319 is null .",
    "this is the obvious covariant extension of @xmath10 being a null vector .",
    "the problem of interest here is to find the fields generated by a point source held at rest outside the horizon of a radially - symmetric black hole .",
    "the @xmath149-function in this case can be taken as that of equation  .",
    "the solution to this problem can be found by adapting the work of copson  @xcite and linet  @xcite to the present gauge choices .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , that the charge is placed on the @xmath323-axis a distance @xmath2 from the origin ( @xmath324 ) , the vector potential can be written in terms of a single scalar potential @xmath325 as @xmath326 it follows that @xmath327 and @xmath328 the maxwell equations now reduce to the single partial differential equation @xmath329 where @xmath330 is a @xmath331-function at @xmath332 .",
    "this was the problem originally tackled by copson  @xcite who obtained a solution that was valid locally in the vicinity of the charge , but contained an additional pole at the origin .",
    "linet  @xcite modified copson s solution by removing the singularity at the origin to produce a potential @xmath325 whose only pole is on the @xmath323-axis at @xmath332 .",
    "linet s solution is @xmath333 where @xmath334 an important feature of this solution is that once   is inserted back into   the resultant @xmath161 is both finite and continuous at the horizon .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath335 is well - defined at the horizon , both @xmath59 and @xmath336 must also be finite and continuous there .",
    "working in the newtonian gauge has enabled us to construct a global solution , and we can therefore study its global properties .",
    "one simple way to illustrate the global properties of the solution is to plot the streamlines of @xmath337 which , from equation  , is divergenceless away from the source .",
    "the streamlines should therefore spread out from the charge and cover all space .",
    "since the distance scale @xmath25 is fixed to the gravitationally - defined distance , the streamlines of @xmath337 convey genuine intrinsic information .",
    "hence the plots are completely unaffected by our choice for the @xmath267 or @xmath338 functions , or indeed our choice of @xmath119-coordinate .",
    "figure  [ max - fig1 ] shows streamline plots for charges held at different distances above the horizon .",
    "similar plots were first obtained by hanni  & ruffini  @xcite although , as they worked with the schwarzschild metric , they were unable to extend their plots through the horizon .",
    "the plots reveal an effective contraction in the radial direction .",
    "it is not hard to show that the contraction is precisely that of a particle moving with the free - fall velocity @xmath339 relative to a fixed observer .",
    "the description presented here of the fields due to a point charge is very different from that advocated by the ` membrane paradigm '  @xcite .",
    "the membrane paradigm was an attempt to develop the theory of black holes in a way that , as far as possible , employed only familiar physical concepts . in this way",
    ", gravitational effects could be incorporated correctly without requiring an understanding of the full theory .",
    "the hope was that astrophysicists would adopt this paradigm when modelling regions where black - hole physics could be significant , such as at the heart of a quasar .",
    "the paradigm works by drawing a veil over the horizon ( the membrane ) and concentrating on the physics outside the horizon as seen by observers remaining at a fixed distance ( fiducial observers ) . our view",
    ", however , is that it is the newtonian gauge which provides the clearest understanding of the physics of black holes while requiring minimal modification to newtonian and special - relativistic ideas .",
    "furthermore , writing the maxwell equations in the form   removes any difficulties in applying conventional reasoning to the study electromagnetism in a gravitational background .",
    "there are other ways that our approach offers advantages over the membrane paradigm .",
    "when applying the membrane paradigm one has to work with quantities which are singular at the horizon , and this is hardly a recipe for applying traditional intuition ! as we have seen , once formulated in the newtonian gauge ( or any other gauge admissible in gtg ) all physical quantities are finite .",
    "the membrane paradigm also warns physicists against producing plots such as figure  [ max - fig1 ] , because such plots depend on the choice of radial coordinate .",
    "but our intrinsic approach makes it clear that such plots _ are _ meaningful , because @xmath25 is determined uniquely by the riemann tensor .",
    "presenting the plots in the form of figure  [ max - fig1 ] enables direct physical information to be read off . in short , the simple physical picture provided by our intrinsic method and newtonian - gauge solution disposes of any need to adopt the artificial ideas advocated by the membrane paradigm .",
    "an interesting feature of the above solution   is the existence of a repulsive ` polarisation ' force  @xcite , one effect of which is that a smaller force is needed to keep a charged particle at rest outside a black hole than an uncharged one . in their derivation of this force ,",
    "smith  & will  @xcite employed a complicated energy argument that involved renormalising various divergent integrals . here",
    "we show that the same force can be derived from a simple argument based on the polarisation effects of the dielectric described by a black hole .",
    "first , however , we must be clear how force is defined . in the presence of an electromagnetic field the equation of motion for a point particle",
    "is modified to @xmath340 we therefore expect that any additional force should also be described by a covariant bivector which couples to the velocity the same way that @xmath161 does .",
    "so , if we denote the externally applied force as @xmath341 , the equation of motion for a neutral test particle becomes @xmath342 now , suppose that @xmath341 is chosen so that the particle remains at a fixed distance @xmath2 outside the horizon of a black hole .",
    "the equation for the trajectory is @xmath343 where the constants @xmath344 and @xmath345 specify the angular position of the particle .",
    "the covariant velocity is @xmath346 and the condition that @xmath347 forces @xmath348 so that @xmath349 , and hence @xmath350 , are constant .",
    "equation   now reduces to @xmath351 where @xmath352 is the unit outward spatial vector from the source to the particle .",
    "the magnitude of the force is therefore @xmath353 and it is not hard to check that this result is gauge - invariant .",
    "equation   reduces to the newtonian formula at large distances and becomes singular as the horizon is approached , where an infinite force is required to remain at rest .",
    "we now want to see how this expression for the force is modified if the particle is charged and feels a force due to its own polarisation field . from   the extra term in the force",
    "is simply @xmath161 , and only the radial term contributes . from equation",
    "this is just @xmath354 . since the charge lies on the @xmath323 axis , we need only look at @xmath355 along this axis , for which @xmath356 the singular terms must be due to the particle s own coulomb field , and",
    "so do not generate a polarisation force .",
    "the only term that generates a force is therefore the final one , which is precisely the term that linet added to copson s original formula !",
    "this term produces an outward - directed force on the charge , of magnitude @xmath357 .",
    "the applied force is therefore now @xmath358 so a smaller force is needed to keep the particle at rest outside the horizon .",
    "this result agrees with that found in  @xcite , though our derivation avoids the need for infinite mass renormalisation and is considerably simpler .",
    "this result is a good example of the importance of finding global solutions .",
    "the polarisation force is felt outside the horizon , yet the correction term that led to it was motivated by the properties of the field at the origin .",
    "we saw in section  [ ss - cos ] that one form of the @xmath149-function for a homogeneous cosmology is defined by   @xmath359 where @xmath360 .",
    "when @xmath361 is positive , however , the function   is undefined for @xmath362 and so fails to define a global solution .",
    "a globally - valid solution is obtained with the displacement @xmath363 which results in the particularly simple solution @xmath364 this solution is well - defined for all @xmath0 and generates an ` isotropic ' line element .",
    "( the solution can also be viewed as resulting from a stereographic projection of a 3-sphere . )",
    "we want to find the fields due to a point charge in the background defined by  .",
    "since the @xmath149-function is diagonal we start with the obvious anstz @xmath365 so that @xmath366 and @xmath367 it follows that the equation we need to solve is simply @xmath368 where the charge @xmath369 is located at @xmath370 .",
    "this equation can be solved using the general technique described by hadamard ( see also copson  @xcite for a discussion of a similar problem . ) the solution to   turns out to be @xmath371 where @xmath372 as a simple check , @xmath355 reduces to the usual coulomb potential when @xmath251 .",
    "( 300,270 ) ( 0,270 ) ( 147,-10)@xmath0 ( 0,134)@xmath323    fieldline plots of the @xmath337 field defined from   are shown in figure  [ max - fig3 ] .",
    "the fieldlines follow null geodesics and clearly reveal the existence of an image charge .",
    "the reason for this is can be seen in the denominator of @xmath355 . not only is @xmath355 singular at @xmath373 , it is also singular at @xmath374 so , if the charge lies on the @xmath323 axis , the position of its image is found by solving @xmath375 from which we find that the image charge is located at @xmath376 ( this is the stereographic projection of the opposite point to the charge on a 3-sphere . )",
    "however , if we try to remove this image charge by adding a point source at its position , we find that the fields vanish everywhere , since the new source has its own image which cancels the original charge .",
    "the image charge is therefore an unavoidable feature of @xmath377 cosmologies .",
    "we comment on this further in section  [ cos ] .",
    "in this paper we began by introducing the gravitational gauge fields and minimally coupling these to the dirac action . for our final major application",
    "we return to the dirac equation in a gravitational background . in the absence of an @xmath378 field ,",
    "the minimally - coupled equation   is @xmath379 here we consider two applications : the case of a black - hole background ; and cosmological models in which the universe is not at critical density .",
    "we have already demonstrated that the newtonian gauge solution dramatically simplifies the study of black - hole physics , so this is the natural gauge in which to study the dirac equation .",
    "we therefore start with an analysis in this gauge , and then consider the gauge - invariance of the predictions made . with the gravitational fields as described in section  [ ss - bh ] , the dirac equation   becomes @xmath380 if we pre - multiply by @xmath51 and introduce the symbol @xmath381 to represent right - sided multiplication by @xmath216 , so that @xmath382 , then equation   becomes @xmath383 where @xmath384 .",
    "one feature that emerges immediately is that the newtonian gauge has recovered a hamiltonian form of the dirac equation ( see  @xcite for a discussion of operators , hamiltonians and hermiticity in the spacetime algebra approach to dirac theory ) .",
    "since the newtonian gauge involves the notion of a global time , it might have been expected that this gauge would lend itself naturally to a hamiltonian formulation .",
    "an open question of some interest is whether it is always possible to make such a gauge choice ( see  @xcite for an extension to the kerr solution ) .",

    "all normalised states the final term in   tends to zero as @xmath390 .",
    "but it can be shown from   that wavefunctions tend to the origin as @xmath391 , so the lower limit is finite and @xmath392 is therefore not a hermitian operator .",
    "this immediately rules out the existence of normalisable stationary states with constant real energy  @xcite .",
    "equation   can be used to propagate a spinor defined over some initial spatial surface , and numerical simulations based on this equation give a good picture of the scattering induced by a black hole . here",
    ", however , we wish to focus on an analytical approach .",
    "a result that follows immediately from the hamiltonian form of the dirac equation is that   is manifestly separable , so that we can write @xmath393 as usual , the solution of the @xmath119-equation is @xmath394 where @xmath395 is the separation constant .",
    "the non - hermiticity of @xmath392 means that @xmath395 can not be purely real if @xmath197 is normalisable .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath395 is determined by equation   and , for suitably normalised states , we find that @xmath396 this equation shows that the imaginary part of @xmath395 is necessarily negative , so the wavefunction decays with time .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the streamlines generated by the conserved current @xmath397 are timelike curves and , once inside the horizon , must ultimately terminate on the origin .    with the @xmath119-dependence separated out ,",
    "equation   reduces to @xmath398 to solve this equation we next separate out the angular dependence .",
    "this is achieved using the spherical monogenics , which are the spacetime algebra equivalent of the @xmath399 pauli spinors .",
    "these are described in detail in  @xcite and here we quote the necessary formulae .",
    "the unnormalised monogenic @xmath400 is defined by @xmath401 where @xmath402 , @xmath403 , and @xmath404 are the associated legendre polynomials .",
    "the two properties of the @xmath400 relevant here are @xmath405 now , the operator @xmath406 commutes with the hamiltonian defined by  . constructing eigenstates of this operator with eigenvalue @xmath407 , leads to solutions of the form @xmath408 where @xmath407 is a non - zero integer and @xmath409 and @xmath410 are complex functions of @xmath25 ( _ i.e. _ sums of a scalar and an @xmath216 term ) . substituting   into equation  , and using the properties of the spherical monogenics , we arrive at the coupled radial equations @xmath411 where @xmath412 @xmath413 and @xmath414 are the reduced functions defined by @xmath415 and the primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "( we continue to employ the abbreviation @xmath381 for @xmath216 . )",
    "to analyse   we first rewrite it in the equivalent form @xmath416 this makes it clear that the equations have regular singular points at the origin and horizon ( @xmath417 ) , as well as an irregular singular point at @xmath418 . to our knowledge , the special function theory required to deal with such equations has not been developed . without it",
    "we either attempt a numerical solution , or look for power series with a limited radius of convergence . here we consider the latter approach , and look for power - series solutions around the horizon . to this end",
    "we introduce the series @xmath419 where @xmath420 .",
    "the index @xmath26 controls the radial dependence of @xmath197 at the horizon , so represents a physical quantity . to find the values",
    "that @xmath26 can take , we substitute equation   into   and set @xmath421 .",
    "this results in the equation @xmath422 rewriting this in terms of a single matrix and setting its determinant to zero yields the two indicial roots @xmath423 the @xmath373 solution is entirely sensible  the power series is analytic , and nothing peculiar happens at the horizon .",
    "the existence of this root agrees with our earlier observation that one can evolve the time - dependent equations without encountering any difficulties at the horizon .",
    "the second root is more problematic , as it leads to solutions that are ill - defined at the horizon . before assessing the physical content of these roots , however , we must first check that they are gauge invariant .",
    "if , instead of working in the newtonian gauge , we keep the gauge unspecified then , after separating out the angular dependence , the equations reduce to @xmath424 we can still assume that the @xmath119-dependence is of the form @xmath425 , so that equation   becomes @xmath426 where @xmath427 now , since @xmath428 holds in all gauges , we obtain @xmath429 and substituting in the power series   and setting @xmath421 produces the indicial equation @xmath430_{r=2 m } = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the identity matrix . employing the result that @xmath431 we find that the solutions to the indicial equation are now @xmath432 but in section  [ ss - bh ] we established that @xmath433 at the horizon for all solutions with a forward time direction .",
    "this demonstrates that the indices are indeed intrinsic , with the sign of the imaginary term for the singular root picking up information about the time direction implicit in the presence of the horizon .",
    "the fact that @xmath373 is always a solution of the indicial equation means that solutions always exist that are analytic at the horizon .",
    "determining the split between ingoing and outgoing states of these solutions enables one to calculate reflection coefficients and scattering amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the question we wish to consider is whether the second , singular , root can be physically significant . to address this we look at the current .",
    "the covariant current @xmath162 is given by @xmath397 , and satisfies @xmath434 .",
    "the corresponding non - covariant quantity is therefore @xmath435 which satisfies the flatspace conservation equation @xmath436 .",
    "it is the streamlines of @xmath437 that are plotted as functions of @xmath0 and determine the flow of density .",
    "the crucial terms in @xmath437 are the time component and radial component , which ( ignoring the overall exponential decay term ) are given by @xmath438 the @xmath439 and @xmath440 are finite for all admissible solutions so , for the @xmath373 solution , the components of @xmath437 are well - defined at the horizon .",
    "furthermore , it is easily shown that for @xmath373 the radial flux at the horizon always points inwards .",
    "the @xmath373 root therefore describes the case where the flux crosses the horizon and continues onto the singularity .    for the singular root we must first decide on a branch for the solution so that @xmath197 is fully specified on both sides of the horizon .",
    "we can then assess whether the discontinuity in @xmath197 , and the discontinuity in the current generated by it , are physically acceptable .",
    "to do this , we first write @xmath441 as @xmath442 we can now write @xmath443 and for the choice of argument we take @xmath444 ( the choice of sign will be discussed further below . ) if we now take the limit @xmath445 from above and below we find that the @xmath51 component of @xmath437 is given by @xmath446 where @xmath447 is a positive - definite , finite term and we have split @xmath395 into real and imaginary parts as @xmath448 equation   is valid in all gauges for which @xmath449 at the horizon .",
    "while the density @xmath450 is singular at the horizon , the presence of the positive term @xmath451 ensures that any integral over the horizon is finite and the solution is therefore normalisable .",
    "this link between the properties of @xmath197 at the horizon and at the origin ( where @xmath452 is determined ) provides another example of the importance of finding global solutions to the field equations .",
    "the radial current now turns out to be @xmath453 and is therefore zero at the horizon , and inward - pointing everywhere inside the horizon .",
    "it appears that the existence of the imaginary contribution to @xmath395 does ensure that that the singular solutions have sensible physical properties , and the singularity in @xmath197 at the horizon is no worse than that encountered in the ground state of the hydrogen atom  @xcite .",
    "what is less clear , however , is the extent to which the properties of @xmath197 at the horizon are compatible with the original equation  . in particular , since @xmath197 is both singular and non - differentiable at the horizon , it does not appear that the singular root can be viewed as defining a solution of   over all space .",
    "a number of authors have attempted to give derivations of the hawking temperature and particle flux due to a black hole from an analysis of first - quantised theory , _",
    "i.e. _ from the properties of wave equations alone  @xcite .",
    "this work has generated some controversy  @xcite , so it is interesting to assess how the ideas stand up in gtg .",
    "these derivations focus on the singular solutions to the wave equation ( either klein  gordon or dirac ) , and study the properties of these solutions under the assumption that the energy is real .",
    "if one ignores the problems that @xmath454 introduces for the normalisability of @xmath197 and presses ahead , then from   there is now a non - zero current at the horizon and , furthermore , there is a net creation of flux there .",
    "the ratio of the outward flux to the total flux is simply @xmath455 which defines a fermi  dirac distribution with temperature @xmath456 remarkably , this is the temperature found by hawking  @xcite .",
    "the fact that both the correct fermi  dirac statistics and hawking temperature can be derived in this manner is astonishing , since both are thought to be the result of quantum field theory .",
    "but what can we really make of this derivation ?",
    "the first problem is that setting @xmath452 to zero means that the density is no longer normalisable at the horizon  any integral of the density over the horizon region diverges logarithmically , which is clearly unphysical .",
    "a further problem relates to the choice of branch  .",
    "had the opposite branch been chosen we would not have obtained   and , as pointed out in  @xcite , there is no _ a priori _ justification for the choice made in  .    for the above reasons , the ` derivation ' of   can not be viewed as being sound .",
    "the remarkable thing is that the same techniques can be used to ` derive ' the correct temperatures for the reissner ",
    "nordstrm and rindler cases , as well as the schwinger production rate in a constant electric field . this will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "these further analyses contain another surprise : the temperature at the interior horizon of a reissner ",
    "nordstrm black hole is necessarily negative !",
    "however , while these analyses are both interesting and suggestive , it is only through a study of the full quantum field theory in a black hole background that one can be sure about particle production rates .",
    "a final point in this section is that all our analyses have been based on working with the correct time - asymmetric solutions admitted in gtg . on attempting to force through the analysis in the ` schwarzschild ' gauge ( @xmath457 )",
    ", one discovers that the indices are now given by @xmath458 in this case no analytic solution is possible , and even the presence of an exponential damping factor does not produce a normalisable current at the horizon .",
    "this only serves to reinforce the importance of working with global solutions , since there is no doubt that the presence of non - singular , normalisable solutions is an intrinsic feature of horizons .      as a second application we consider the dirac equation in a cosmological background",
    "we have a choice of form of @xmath149-function to use , of which the simplest is that defined by  , @xmath459 the dirac equation in this background takes the form @xmath460 where the various functions are as defined in section  [ ss - cos ] .",
    "our question is this : can we find solutions to   such that the observables are homogeneous ? there is clearly no difficulty if @xmath251 since , with @xmath238 , equation   is solved by @xmath461 and the observables are fixed vectors which scale as @xmath244 in magnitude  @xcite . but what happens when @xmath1 ?",
    "it turns out that the solution   must be modified to  @xcite @xmath462 for the case of @xmath261 both @xmath139 and @xmath197 are only defined for @xmath463 .",
    "this problem is overcome by using the displacement   to transform to the global solution of equation  . in this case",
    "@xmath197 is given by @xmath464 which diverges as @xmath390 .",
    "in both the @xmath261 and @xmath465 cases , @xmath197 contains additional @xmath25-dependence and so is not homogeneous .",
    "furthermore , the observables obtained from @xmath197 are also inhomogeneous . in principle",
    "one could therefore determine the origin of this space from measurements of the current density .",
    "this clearly violates the principle of homogeneity , though it is not necessarily inconsistent with experiment .",
    "the implications for cosmology of this fact are discussed in the following section .",
    "( some consequences for self - consistent solutions of the einstein  dirac equations are discussed in  @xcite and , in the context of general relativity , in  @xcite . )",
    "the fact that quantum fields see this ` preferred ' direction in @xmath466 models , whereas classical phenomena do not , reflects the gauge structure of the theory .",
    "dirac spinors are the only fields whose action couples them directly to the @xmath467-function .",
    "all other matter fields couple to the gravitational field through the @xmath149-field only .",
    "dirac spinors therefore probe the structure of the gravitational fields directly at level of the @xmath468-field , which is inhomogeneous for @xmath1 models . on the other hand",
    ", classical fields only interact via the covariant quantities obtained from the gravitational fields , which are homogeneous for all values of @xmath361 .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the klein ",
    "gordon equation , for which the action does not contain the @xmath467-field , _ does _ have homogenous solutions in a @xmath1 universe .",
    "in section  [ ss - cos ] we discussed some aspects of cosmology as examples of the general treatment of time - varying spherically - symmetric systems .",
    "there we drew attention to the utility of the newtonian gauge as a tool for tackling problems in cosmology .",
    "in addition , in sections  [ max - cos ] and  [ de - cos ] we studied the maxwell and dirac equations in various cosmological backgrounds . in this section",
    "we draw together some of our conclusions from these sections . specifically , we discuss redshifts , difficulties with @xmath469 models , and the definitions of mass and energy for cosmological models .      as a final demonstration of the use of the newtonian gauge , consider a photon following a null path in the @xmath470 plane . in this case",
    "the photon s momentum can be written as @xmath471 and @xmath472 is the frequency measured by observers comoving with the fluid .",
    "we restrict to the pressureless case , so @xmath473 and @xmath474 , but will allow @xmath243 to be @xmath25-dependent .",
    "a simple application of equation   produces @xmath475 where @xmath476 .",
    "but , since @xmath474 , we find that @xmath477 , so @xmath478 which holds in any spherically - symmetric pressureless fluid .",
    "for the case of a cosmological background we have @xmath479 , so the angular terms drop out of equation  , and we are left with the simple equation @xmath480 which integrates to give the familiar redshift versus density relation @xmath481 other standard cosmological relations , such as the luminosity distance and angular diameter versus redshift formulae , can be easily derived in this gauge ( see also section  [ ss - cos ] ) .    in  @xcite equation",
    "was derived in the gauge of equation  , in which all particles comoving with the cosmological fluid are at rest in the background spacetime . in this gauge",
    "the redshift can be attributed to a loss of energy to the gravitational field , although this is a gauge - dependent viewpoint  the only physical statement that one can make is embodied in equation  .",
    "the explanation of cosmological redshifts in our theory has nothing to do with ` tired light ' , or spacetime playing a dynamic role by expanding , or even anything to do with doppler shifts .",
    "the redshift is simply a consequence of the assumption of homogeneity .",
    "ultimately , all physical predictions are independent of the gauge in which they are made , although certain gauges may have useful computational or heuristic value .      at the level of classical ( _ i.e. _ non - quantum ) physics",
    ", there is no doubt that @xmath1 cosmologies are homogeneous .",
    "this is true in both general relativity and gtg .",
    "no prediction derived for classical systems of point particles or for electromagnetic fields can reveal a preferred spatial direction in these models .",
    "however , we saw in section  [ de - cos ] that it is impossible to find homogeneous solutions of the dirac equation in a @xmath1 universe .",
    "the consequences of this are , in principle , observable , since the local density gradient will reveal a preferred radial direction .",
    "it has already been pointed out that it is impossible to find a _ self - consistent _ solution of the combined system of einstein ",
    "dirac equations for any case other than a spatially flat cosmology  @xcite .",
    "we believe that this is the first time that it has been pointed out that even a _ non_-self - consistent dirac field would be observably inhomogeneous .",
    "this is a more damaging result for @xmath1 cosmologies , since it reveals inhomogeneity without assuming that spin - torsion effects have anything to do with the dynamics of the universe .",
    "while the properties of dirac fields pose theoretical difficulties for @xmath1 models , there is no contradiction with present observations .",
    "furthermore , one could question the validity of inferences drawn in extrapolating the dirac equation to cosmological scales",
    ". there is , however , a purely classical effect that does lead one to question the validity of @xmath261 models .",
    "as we have seen , when looking at the properties of fields in a @xmath261 background it is necessary to work in a globally - defined gauge , such as that of equation  . in this case",
    "the maxwell equations show that each point charge must have an image charge present in a remote region of the universe .",
    "this is a consequence of a closed universe that we have not seen discussed , although it has doubtless been pointed out before .",
    "the necessity for this image charge raises many problems in attempting to take such a universe seriously .",
    "setting aside the problems with @xmath1 models , a further issue on which our theory sheds some light is discussions of the total matter and energy content of the universe . in section  [ colldst ]",
    "we discussed the distinction between the rest - mass energy and the total gravitating energy inside a sphere of radius @xmath25 .",
    "since cosmological models are a special case of the general theory outlined in section  [ ss ] , this same distinction should be significant in cosmology .",
    "in section  [ colldst ] we identified the total gravitating energy of a sphere of radius @xmath25 with the function @xmath482 .",
    "for all cosmological models , this is given by   @xmath483 in strictly homogeneous models the weyl tensor vanishes , and we lose an intrinsically - defined distance scale .",
    "but , if we consider cosmological models as the limiting case of spherically - symmetric systems , then there seems little doubt that   is still the correct expression for the gravitating energy within a sphere of radius @xmath25 surrounding the origin .",
    "moreover , attempts to discover the gravitating content of a region rely on perturbations away from ideal uniformity . in these cases",
    "an intrinsic distance scale is well defined , since a weyl tensor is again present .",
    "( determining the gravitating content of a region is important in , for example , determinations of @xmath484  the ratio of the actual density of the universe to the critical density . ) on the other hand , the total rest mass energy within a sphere of radius @xmath25 centred on the origin must still be given by   @xmath485 this remains a covariant scalar quantity , and is just @xmath244 multiplied by the covariant volume integral ( this is the volume one would measure locally using light paths or fixed rods ) .",
    "we have now defined two covariant scalar quantities , @xmath482 and @xmath486 , both of which are conserved along fluid streamlines in the absence of pressure .",
    "if the identifications made in the spherically - symmetric case remain valid in the homogeneous case , then the difference between these should give the additional contribution to the total energy beyond the rest - mass energy .",
    "for spatially - flat universes we have @xmath487 so there is no difference .",
    "( in terms of the newtonian - gauge description of section  [ colldst ] , the gravitational potential energy cancels the kinetic energy . ) but , for @xmath1 models , there is a difference because @xmath486 is now given by @xmath488 an interesting place to study the difference between @xmath30 and @xmath489 is in a @xmath261 universe at its ` turnaround ' point , as described in section  [ ss - cos ] .",
    "there one finds that , to lowest order in @xmath25 , the difference is given by @xmath490 which is precisely the newtonian formula for the self - potential of a uniform sphere of mass @xmath491 .",
    "this is what we would have expected since , at the turnaround point , the kinetic energy vanishes .",
    "the above should only be viewed as suggestive , but one idea that it appears to rule out is the popular suggestion that the total energy density of the universe should be zero  @xcite . if the above analysis is correct then there is no possibility of the total energy density @xmath482 ever being zero .",
    "furthermore , for spatially - flat models  which we consider the most likely  the total energy density resides entirely in the rest - mass energies of the particles in the universe and can not be cancelled by a negative gravitational contribution .",
    "in this paper we developed a theory of gravity consisting of gauge fields defined in a flat background spacetime .",
    "the theory is conceptually simple , and the role of the gauge fields is clearly understood  they ensure invariance under arbitrary displacements and rotations .",
    "while it is possible to maintain a classical picture of the rotation gauge group , a full understanding of its role is only achieved once the dirac action is considered .",
    "the result is a theory which offers a radically different interpretation of gravitational interactions from that provided by general relativity . despite this , the two theories agree in their predictions for a wide range of phenomena .",
    "differences only begin to emerge over issues such as the role of topology , our insistence on the use of global solutions , and in the interaction with quantum theory .",
    "furthermore , the separation of the gauge fields into one for displacements and one for local rotations is suggestive of physical effects being separated into an inertia field and a force field .",
    "indeed , there is good reason to believe that mass should enter relativistic multiparticle wave equations in the manner of the @xmath149-field  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that , in the development of a multiparticle theory , the @xmath492 and @xmath484 fields will be extended in quite distinct ways .",
    "such possibilities do not appear to be open to a theory such as general relativity , with its reliance on the metric as the ` foundation of all '  @xcite .",
    "probably the closest approach to the theory developed here is the spin-2 field theory discussed by many authors ( see box 17.2 of  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "this theory is usually viewed as reproducing general relativity exactly , albeit in a somewhat ugly form due to the existence of a background spacetime and the reliance on infinite series of the field variable . by contrast",
    ", we hope to have demonstrated that gtg has an internal attractiveness of its own , as well as simplicity due to its first - order nature .    a crucial question to address is whether any experimental tests are likely to distinguish between general relativity and gtg in the immediate future .",
    "the biggest differences between general relativity and gtg to emerge to date lie in the treatment of black hole singularities  @xcite , but these are unlikely to be testable for some considerable time ! a more promising area is the link between gravity and quantum spin .",
    "gtg makes a clear prediction for the type and magnitude of this interaction , whereas it is not uniquely picked out in general spin - torsion theories , or in more general poincar gauge theory .",
    "any experiment measuring this interaction would therefore provide a clear test of gtg .",
    "a partial exploration of the effects of spin interactions in gtg is contained in  @xcite .    the techniques developed here",
    "reveal some remarkable properties of spherically - symmetric systems .",
    "it has been known since the 1930 s  @xcite that , in the absence of pressure , the dynamical equations of cosmology can be cast in a newtonian form .",
    "we have now shown that a single , unified , newtonian treatment can be given for all spherically - symmetric pressureless fluids , whether homogeneous or not .",
    "furthermore , effects that have hitherto been viewed as the result of spacetime curvature can now be understood in a simple alternative fashion .",
    "the result is a physical picture in which the background spacetime has no effect on either dynamics or kinematics .",
    "this , we believe , is both new and potentially very useful . for example , simulations of black hole formation , and studies of the behaviour of the universe as a whole , can be carried out in exactly the same framework .",
    "all previous studies have relied on cutting and pasting various metrics together , with the result that no clear , global view of the underlying physics can be achieved .",
    "these advantages are exploited in  @xcite to model the growth of a spherically - symmetric perturbation in a homogeneous background cosmology , and to study the effect of the perturbation on the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the intrinsic method described here , and used to study spherically - symmetric systems , is quite general and can be applied to a wide range of problems . in  @xcite the method",
    "is applied to a restricted class of cylindrically - symmetric systems , and elsewhere we have presented treatments of axisymmetric systems  @xcite . in all cases studied to date , the intrinsic method has brought considerable clarity to what would otherwise be a largely mysterious mess of algebra .",
    "this is achieved by removing the dependence on an arbitrary coordinate system , and instead working directly with physical quantities .",
    "the same technique also looks well suited to the study of cosmological perturbation theory , about which there has been considerable recent debate  @xcite .",
    "the interaction between dirac theory and the gauge theory developed here revealed a number of surprises .",
    "the first was that consistency of the action principle with the minimal - coupling procedure restricted us to a theory that is unique up to the possible inclusion of a cosmological constant .",
    "the second was that spatially flat cosmologies are the only ones that are consistent with homogeneity at the level of the single - particle dirac equation .",
    "the final surprise was provided by a study of the dirac equation in a black hole background , which revealed a remarkable link with the hawking temperature and quantum field theory .",
    "much work remains to settle the issues raised by this final point , however .    as a final remark",
    ", we also hope to have demonstrated the power of geometric algebra in analysing many physical problems .",
    "many of the derivations performed in this paper would have been far more cumbersome in any other language , and none are capable of the compact expressions provided by geometric algebra for , say , the riemann tensor .",
    "in addition , use of geometric algebra enabled us to remove all reference to coordinate frames from the fundamental equations .",
    "this is a real aid to providing a clear physical understanding of the mathematics involved",
    ". we would encourage anyone interested in studying the consequences of our theory to take time to master the techniques of geometric algebra .",

    "note , however , that @xmath542 thus the derivatives of @xmath543 and @xmath544 give different results , regardless of any symmetry properties of @xmath492 .",
    "this has immediate implications for the symmetry ( or lack of symmetry ) of the functional stress - energy tensors for certain fields .",
    "we finally need some results for derivatives with respect to the bivector - valued linear function @xmath180 .",
    "the extensions are straightforward , and we just give the required results : @xmath545",

    "we can therefore write @xmath554 since @xmath555 we find that @xmath556 which recovers ` metric compatibility ' of the connection .",

    "equation   can be inverted to show that the connection contains a component given by the standard christoffel symbol .",

    "the contorsion is formed from @xmath562 by @xmath563 for our gauge theory of gravity , the torsion is exclusively of the type @xmath564 , where @xmath565 is the spin trivector , in which case @xmath566    if we now consider the covariant derivative of a covariant vector @xmath567 , we find that @xmath568 so that the components of the vector @xmath569 are those expected for tensor calculus .",

    "so , for example , @xmath161 can be decomposed to @xmath575 , @xmath576 or @xmath577 .",
    "tensor calculus is poor at revealing which , if any , of the components represent a physical observable .",

    "<S> a new gauge theory of gravity is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is constructed in a flat background spacetime and employs gauge fields to ensure that all relations between physical quantities are independent of the positions and orientations of the matter fields . in this manner </S>",
    "<S> all properties of the background spacetime are removed from physics , and what remains are a set of ` intrinsic ' relations between physical fields . for a wide range of phenomena , including all present experimental tests , the theory reproduces the predictions of general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> differences do emerge , however , through the first - order nature of the equations and the global properties of the gauge fields , and through the relationship with quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the gravitational gauge fields are derived from both classical and quantum viewpoints . </S>",
    "<S> field equations are then derived from an action principle , and consistency with the minimal coupling procedure selects an action that is unique up to the possible inclusion of a cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn singles out a unique form of spin - torsion interaction . </S>",
    "<S> a new method for solving the field equations is outlined and applied to the case of a time - dependent , spherically - symmetric perfect fluid . </S>",
    "<S> a gauge is found which reduces the physics to a set of essentially newtonian equations . </S>",
    "<S> these equations are then applied to the study of cosmology , and to the formation and properties of black holes . </S>",
    "<S> insistence on finding global solutions , together with the first - order nature of the equations , leads to a new understanding of the role played by time reversal . </S>",
    "<S> this alters the physical picture of the properties of a horizon around a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of global solutions enables one to discuss the properties of field lines inside the horizon due to a point charge held outside it . </S>",
    "<S> the dirac equation is studied in a black hole background and provides a quick derivation of the hawking temperature . some applications to cosmology </S>",
    "<S> are also discussed , and a study of the dirac equation in a cosmological background reveals that the only models consistent with homogeneity are spatially flat . </S>",
    "<S> it is emphasised throughout that the description of gravity in terms of gauge fields , rather than spacetime geometry , leads to many simple and powerful physical insights . </S>",
    "<S> the language of ` geometric algebra ' best expresses the physical and mathematical content of the theory and is employed throughout . </S>",
    "<S> methods for translating the equations into other languages ( tensor and spinor calculus ) are given in appendices .    </S>",
