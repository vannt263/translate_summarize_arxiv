    "the chiral anomaly  @xcite , which is a basic feature of quantum field theory , has been the subject of extensive theoretical investigations .",
    "there are a number of calculations for decays of the pseudoscalar mesons ",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5  @xcite ; however few experimental studies of this anomaly have been performed so far . with the increased interest in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite ,",
    "the chiral anomaly has attracted renewed attention . in particular ,",
    "non - leptonic kaon decays are well - suited for the study of chpt .",
    "it is known , however , that the genuine manifestation of the chiral anomaly in non - leptonic decays is restricted to the radiative decay of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) for the charged kaon  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) decay is hindered because it violates the @xmath8=1/2 rule . as a consequence , the internal bremsstrahlung ( ib )",
    "contribution to @xmath1 decay is suppressed , although it is still dominant .",
    "this feature , in turn , could enhance the direct photon emission ( de ) which is sensitive to meson structure .",
    "here , the chiral anomaly appears as the magnetic component of de . in terms of chpt",
    ", it enters the magnetic amplitude at @xmath9 ) , while ib arises from @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "also , the electric amplitude of de may arise from @xmath9 ) , which one can identify through the interference pattern ( int ) with ib .",
    "thus the @xmath11 decay channel is one of the most interesting and important channels in determining the low energy structure of qcd .",
    "three in - flight-@xmath12 experiments  @xcite and one stopped-@xmath12 experiment  @xcite have reported on the de branching ratio in the @xmath13 kinetic energy region of @xmath14 mev .",
    "these experiments restricted the @xmath15 region to avoid backgrounds from @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) decay , although the de component is significantly enhanced with decreasing @xmath13 energy .",
    "the weighted average of the in - flight @xmath12 experiments is @xmath18  @xcite which is much larger than the result from the stopped @xmath12 experiment @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "therefore , further experimental studies are necessary to settle this discrepancy of the de branching ratio .",
    "it is also desirable to check the existence of the int component which has not yet been observed .    in this letter",
    ", we present a new measurement of direct photon emission in @xmath1 decay .",
    "the experiment used a stopped @xmath12 beam in conjunction with a superconducting toroidal spectrometer with a 12-sector iron - core  @xcite .",
    "we measured the @xmath1 events by extending the @xmath15 region ( @xmath2035 mev ) below the @xmath17 upper threshold ( @xmath2155 mev ) .",
    "the experiment was performed at the kek 12 gev proton synchrotron .",
    "the experimental apparatus was based on the e246 experiment searching for @xmath22-violating transverse muon polarization in @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) decay  @xcite .",
    "besides the @xmath22-violation search , spectroscopic studies for @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath24 , and @xmath17 decays have been carried out using the same detector system  @xcite . a schematic cross sectional view of the detector is shown in fig .",

    "because of the rotational symmetry of the 12 identical gaps in the spectrometer and the large directional acceptance of the photon detector  @xcite , distortions of the @xmath1 spectra due to instrumental misalignment , if any , were drastically reduced .    a separated 660 mev/@xmath27 @xmath12 beam ( @xmath28 ) was used .",
    "each @xmath12 was discriminated from pion background by a @xmath29erenkov counter with an efficiency of more than 99% .",
    "the typical @xmath12 beam intensity was @xmath30 over a 2 s spill duration with a 4 s repetition rate .",
    "the kaons were slowed down by a degrader and stopped in an active target located at the center of the detector system .",
    "the @xmath1 events were identified by analyzing the @xmath13 momentum with the spectrometer and detecting three photons in the csi(tl ) calorimeter .",
    "charged particles from the target were tracked and momentum - analyzed using multi - wire proportional chambers at the entrance ( c2 ) and exit ( c3 and c4 ) of the magnet gap , as well as an array of ring counters  @xcite surrounding the active target system .",
    "the @xmath13s were discriminated from @xmath31 and @xmath32 by calculating the mass squared ( @xmath33 ) of the charged particles from the time - of - flight between tof1 and tof2 counters .",
    "counter tof1 surrounded the active target and counter tof2 was located at the exit of the spectrometer .",
    "the measurement was carried out for the central magnetic field strength b=0.65 t which was chosen to match the spectrometer acceptance to the @xmath13 momentum distribution due to the de process .",
    "the photon detector , an assembly of 768 csi(tl ) crystals , covered 75% of the total solid angle .",

    "timing information from each module was used to identify a photon cluster and to suppress accidental backgrounds due to beam particles . a pb - plastic sandwich detector with 2.6 radiation length was set at the outer radius of the magnet pole to monitor photons passing through the photon detector holes , as shown in fig .",

    "@xmath11 decays at rest were obtained by the following procedure which was carefully studied in a monte carlo simulation ( see below ) .",
    "the @xmath12 decay time , defined as the @xmath13 signal at the tof1 counter , was required to be more than 1.4 ns later than the @xmath12 arrival time measured by the @xmath29erenkov counter .",
    "this reduced the fraction of @xmath12 decays in - flight contamination to the level of @xmath34 .",
    "events with @xmath13 decays in - flight and scattering of charged particles from the magnet pole faces were eliminated by requiring the hit position in ring counters to be consistent with the charged particle track .",

    "the ib events with incorrect pairing mimic the de decay and might introduce a systematic error . in order to find the correct pairing , a quantity @xmath48 defined as , @xmath49 was calculated for the three combinations , and the pair with the minimum @xmath48 , @xmath50 , was adopted as the @xmath47 pair . here",
