    "the theory of general relativity has raised questions soon after it was formulated .",
    "even though it passed numerous experimental tests , it still poses problems at larger scales .",
    "for instance , already at the galactic scale , one has to invoke extra ingredient to understand the galactic rotational curve . on a more theoretical aspect ,",
    "gravity is a non renormalizable theory which is a major obstacle to a quantum formulation of gravity .",
    "all these reasons and many others call for a completion or modification to general relativity",
    ". there are essentially three possibilities , either adding new degrees of freedom , either changing the space - time dynamics or the matter to gravity coupling .",
    "there might be relations between these approaches and they can be mixed , but we do nt discuss this aspect here . in this proceeding , we focus on the last possibility , namely the matter to gravity coupling . in particular , we use a recently proposed model to discuss the coupling , namely the eddington inspired born infeld ( eibi ) model @xcite .",
    "the eddington inspired born infeld model of gravitation @xcite is described by the following action @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the metric , @xmath2 is the ricci tensor built from an independent connection , say @xmath3 , @xmath4 is a minimally coupled matter action , @xmath5 is essentially the newton constant and @xmath6 is the comsological constant .",
    "variation  la palatini leads to the following set of equations @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath1 and @xmath8 are the determinant of @xmath9 and @xmath10 and where @xmath11 are the matrix inverses of @xmath12 .",
    "interestingly , this theory identically reduces to general relativity in vacuum .",
    "in fact , it does not introduce additional degrees of freedom compared to general relativity .",
    "a direct consequence of these two ingredients is that the theory changes only _ inside _ matter .",
    "this leads to a bunch of interesting consequences , essentially regarding singularities in general relativity .",
    "for example , it was shown @xcite that the big - bang singularity might be avoided with such a model .",
    "it was also argued that astrophysical singularities may be avoided or softened in black hole formation processes @xcite      the eibi model of gravity can be reformulated in a way that makes the modification with respect to general relativity very explicit .",
    "in particular , the case of perfect fluids matter field is quite enlightening @xcite .",
    "indeed , equations can be rewritten in the following form @xmath13 = r^a{}_b - \\frac{1}{2 } \\delta^a{}_b r = \\gamma\\mathcal{t}^a{}_b - \\lambda\\delta^a{}_b , \\label{einstein_q}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and where we defined the apparent stress tensor @xmath15 defined as @xmath16 and the cosmological constant @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 plays the role of an isotropic pressure addition . for the case of a perfect fluid ,",
    "the metric @xmath1 can be eliminated explicitly , leaving a theory of pure general relativity coupled to a perfect fluid with a modified equation of state .",
    "more precisely , the metric determinant ratio is given by @xmath19^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] .",
    "this reformulation shows explicitly , at least in the case of a perfect fluid how the coupling between gravity and matter is changed in this theory .",
    "it should be noted however that in this reformulated case , matter is coupled ( in a modified way ) to the metric @xmath8 , which is an auxiliary metric in the original theory .",
    "however , since observations are usually performed from outside matter , since both metric are the same in vacuum , the effect of the modified coupling to @xmath8 affects measurements performed with @xmath1 in vacuum indirectly .",
    "interestingly enough , all the nice features of the eibi model can be understood in terms of the reformulated version and of the modification in the coupling @xcite .",
    "this motivates further studies in pure coupling modification .",
    "it should be mentioned that the set of equivalent equations can be obtained from the following action principle : @xmath20   - 2 \\frac{\\lambda}{\\kappa } + \\frac{1}{\\kappa } ( q^{ab}g_{ab } - 2 \\tau ) \\right ] \\ !",
    "+ s_m(g ) , \\label{equiv_action}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is minimally coupled to @xmath1 .",
    "this action is very similar to a bi - metric theory , apart from the fact that the metric @xmath1 is not dynamical .",
    "this is the particular case of the eibi theory of gravity , but it is tempting to use this action as a basis for investigating coupling modifications .",
    "theories effectively changing the coupling between matter and gravity pass most experimental tests of general relativity , provided they are equivalent in vacuum .",
    "note that most of the tests of gravity are in fact testing general relativity in vacuum .",
    "an interesting realization of such a theory is the eddington born infeld theory of gravity .",
    "we made an explicit correspondence between the modification of the matter / gravity coupling and the interesting features of the eibi model .",
    "in particular we showed that in the case of a perfect fluid , it is possible to fully reexpress the theory as a pure general relativistic model with a modification to the equation of state of the fluid . as a consequence , the fluid , keeps all its standard properties , except from a gravitational point of view where the geometry sees it differently .",
    "this results in an apparent matter content .",
    "it should be mentioned that the resulting apparent source displays interesting features towards energy conditions ( see detailed discussion in @xcite ) . +",
