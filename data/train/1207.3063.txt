    "studying the evolution of dense star clusters , such as old globular clusters ( gcs ) , is of great interest for a variety of branches of astronomy and astrophysics .",
    "the high central densities and high masses of gcs make them hotbeds for strong dynamical interactions facilitating formation of many exotic sources ( e.g. , x - ray binaries , millisecond radio pulsars , type ia supernovae , and blue straggler stars ) .",
    "gcs are important targets for extragalactic astronomy",
    ". detailed observations of their spatial distribution in a galaxy can constrain , for example , the potential of the dark matter halo , and give clues to the assembly history of the galaxy .",
    "the old ages of gcs provide a direct window into the major star - formation episodes in the early universe .",
    "one long - standing question regarding gcs concerns the nature of their progenitors .",
    "the observed young massive star clusters seem to be potential progenitors of the current gcs .",
    "the masses , typical sizes , and inferred dissolution timescales for the so - called  super star clusters \" , as observed , for example , in m51 , make them especially good candidates .",
    "interestingly , similar to the galactic gcs ( ggc ) , the sizes of observed super star clusters are typically a few parsecs independent of the cluster mass .",
    "however , the link between these super star clusters and the old evolved ggcs as well as gcs in other galaxies remains speculative .",
    "the main difficulty in establishing a link between the two populations is that almost a hubble time of evolution separates them .",
    "although the individual qualitative effects of each physical process in a gc has been known from decades of numerical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is impossible to estimate the collective effect of these interdependent processes unless a self - consistent simulation is done including them all .",
    "for example , two - body relaxation leads to a slow energy diffusion from the core to the halo in a gc leading to a slow and steady contraction of the core until the gravo - thermal instability occurs and the core collapses under gravity .",
    "since , due to equipartition of energy , the low - mass stars are scattered to higher velocities relative to their high - mass counterparts , two - body relaxation also leads to mass segregation in the cluster .",
    "the high - mass stars sink to the core and the low - mass stars escape to the halo and preferentially get stripped through the tidal boundary of the cluster . because of this preferential loss of low - mass stars , the stellar mf changes with time .",
    "the stellar mf , in turn , determines the fraction of low and high - mass stars in a cluster as well as the average stellar mass , affecting the mass - segregation timescale @xcite .",
    "the contraction of the core via two - body relaxation increases its density .",
    "the core density determines the interaction rate in the core .",
    "these rates affect the binary - single ( bs ) and binary - binary ( bb ) interaction probabilities at a given time .",
    "the bs and bb interactions in turn generate energy in the core and can support the core stopping further contraction , thus , affecting the central density . the bs and bb interactions also change the orbital properties of the binaries taking part in these scattering interactions .",
    "these changes in the binary orbits can alter the evolution pathways that would be taken by a given binary which in turn changes , for example , the rate of formation of exotic stellar populations such as x - ray binaries and blue straggles stars ( bss ) . due to this complexity in the evolution of dense star clusters , the only way to learn more about the possible initial properties of the observed gcs is to perform numerical simulations including all of the above physical processes in tandem with reasonable accuracy for a large enough @xmath0 .",
    "the study of gcs has a somewhat long and varied history during which numerical simulations and observations have complemented each other @xcite .",
    "in particular , understanding the physical processes in the cores of ggcs has been of prime interest since the evolution of these dense clusters are driven mainly by the energy generation in the core and the transport of this energy from the core .",
    "the ggcs are observed to show a clear bimodal distribution of the core sizes that separates the so - called  core - collapsed \" clusters from the non core - collapsed clusters @xcite .",
    "the core - collapsed clusters in general show a power - law slope in their density profiles near the center .",
    "in contrast , the density profiles of the non core - collapsed clusters are well described by a king profile @xcite and show a clear flat part near the center .",
    "theoretical analysis based on the current estimated relaxation times for the ggcs indicate that the majority of the ggcs should have had a deep collapse @xcite .",
    "thus , before it was found that all ggcs contain dynamically significant numbers of binaries , theoretical studies focused on understanding the process of core - collapse via the balance of outward diffusion of energy from the core due to two - body relaxation and post - collapse evolution due to dynamical formation of binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . after it was observed in the early 1990s that all ggcs contain sufficient number of binaries such that they must have been born with substantial primordial binary populations , theoretical studies focused on properties of clusters in the  binary - burning \" phase in which the outward diffusion of energy via two - body relaxation is balanced by production of energy via dynamical hardening of binaries ( e.g. , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was also realized that even a small primordial binary fraction can support the core from deep collapse for more than a hubble time @xcite .",
    "however , comparison between theoretical predictions and observations show that the theoretically predicted core radii during the binary - burning phase for these clusters are at least an order of magnitude smaller than the observed core radii for the bulk of the ggcs @xcite .",
    "additional energy sources were proposed to explain these large core sizes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , these scenarios need rather special conditions and seem unlikely to be satisfied by most of the ggcs .",
    "very basic questions remain .",
    "does the bimodal distribution for the ggc core sizes separating the core - collapsed and non core - collapsed clusters indicate a physical difference between these clusters ?",
    "what dynamical stage are the core - collapsed and non core - collapsed clusters in today ? can the large core sizes of the non core - collapsed ( majority of the galactic population ) be explained without any special conditions simply as a result of @xmath1 of evolution from realistic initial conditions ?    in this study",
    "we present the results from a large number of computer simulations ( 224 ) with initial conditions drawn from a multidimensional grid , spanning all relevant parameter ranges as suggested by observations of young star clusters , with the goal of reproducing a population of old clusters similar to the ggcs .",
    "we use cmc , a hnon - type monte carlo code including all physical processes such as single and binary stellar evolution , two - body relaxation , strong encounters comprising physical collisions and binary - mediated scattering , and tidal stripping due to the galactic tidal field .",
    "cmc has been extensively tested and the results from cmc show excellent agreement with those from direct @xmath0-body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our goal is to find whether starting from realistic initial conditions ( including @xmath0 , stellar mass function , central density , compactness parameter , binary fraction , and cluster size ) typical of the observed young massive star clusters and without any special treatment clusters similar in properties to the observed old ggcs are naturally obtained after @xmath1 of evolution . in particular , we focus on understanding the bimodal distribution of the observed ggc core radii to identify the dynamical stages of the so called core - collapsed and non core - collapsed clusters .    in section  [ sec : numerics ]",
    "we briefly explain our code and introduce working definitions for key structural parameters of a cluster . in section  [ sec : initial_conditions ] we describe the multidimensional grid of initial parameters explored in this study . in section  [ sec : results ]",
    "we present our key results . in section  [ sec :",
    "core - collapsed ] we show our results identifying the dynamical evolutionary state for the observed core - collapsed ggcs .",
    "finally we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we use our hnon - type cluster monte carlo code ( cmc ) to numerically model star clusters with single and binary stars including all physical processes relevant in globular clusters such as two - body relaxation , single and binary stellar evolution , strong encounters including physical collisions and binary mediated strong scattering encounters .",
    "this code has been developed and rigorously tested over the past decade @xcite . using a large grid of initial conditions over the range of values typical for observed young massive clusters we create over @xmath2 detailed star - by - star models and evolve them for @xmath3 .",
    "a handful ( about 6 ) of these models reach a very deep collapse phase . for these models",
    "the cmc time steps become minuscule and the code grinds to a halt .",
    "we stop our simulations at that point for these clusters . in reality",
    ", the deep - collapse phase is halted via formation of the so - called  three - body \" binaries and the cluster enters into the gravo - thermal oscillation phase . since in cmc we do not yet include the possibility of creating new binaries via three body encounters , we do not address this phase at this stage .",
    "this however , is not a serious limitation .",
    "all clusters that reach a very deep collapse stage before the integration is stopped at @xmath4 , had zero primordial binaries which is not realistic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ", we only include these clusters in our analysis as limiting cases .",
    "even a small non - zero primordial binary fraction ( @xmath5 ; lowest @xmath6 is used in our simulations ) can stop the cluster core from collapsing through the dynamical hardening of binaries preventing very deep core collapse . at this stage",
    "the core size remains more or less constant , which is also commonly referred to as  binary - burning \" stage .",
    "a more detailed description of the code , and the various qualitatively different dynamical stages for a cluster s evolution is presented in @xcite .",
    "since one key goal for this study is to compare the properties of our simulated models at about @xmath4 with the properties of observed ggcs , we have to make sure the same parameter definitions are used .",
    "in particular there are different definitions for the core radius and the cluster size commonly used by theoreticians and observers .",
    "the three dimensional core radius @xmath7 widely used in @xmath0-body simulations is a density - weighted measure related to the virial radius in the core @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the core radius for observed clusters , @xmath8 , is often defined as the distance from the center where the projected surface brightness profile drops to half its central value . alternatively ,",
    "when observations with sufficiently high resolution are available , the core radius can also be based on star - counts representing the radius where the projected surface number density is half the corresponding central value .",
    "if the core radius is calculated using the stellar number density profile , we will call it @xmath9 , while the core radius based on the brightness , or luminosity , density profile is denoted by @xmath10 . in real clusters",
    "the density profiles can have large scatter , especially close to the centre due to poisson noise and the presence of bright giants that dominate the light but are only few in number .",
    "hence , it is common practice to exclude the light from the brightest giants when calculating the luminosity density profile for real clusters to reduce noise ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the purpose of this study we define @xmath11 as the core radius obtained from a luminosity density profile excluding giants with @xmath12 .",
    "since the estimated value of @xmath8 is strongly dependent on the estimate of the peak luminosity density at the centre of a cluster , values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 can differ significantly . for real clusters",
    "even when star counts are available , only stars above a certain brightness can be counted due to completeness issues .",
    "hence , we define @xmath13 calculated using a number density profile including only stars that are on the main - sequence or on the giant branch with masses @xmath14 , representing the currently achievable completeness limit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we find that the @xmath13 values and the @xmath9 values are not much different for our simulated clusters .",
    "the three dimensional half - mass radius @xmath15 is defined as the radius that includes half of the total mass of the cluster .",
    "however , for real clusters this quantity is not directly accessible , rather , the two dimensional , projected distance enclosing half of the total light of the cluster is calculated and is defined as the half - light radius @xmath16 .",
    "we further define @xmath17 for the half - light radius for our simulated models by calculating the same quantity but excluding bright giants with @xmath12 .",
    "we find that the @xmath18 and @xmath17 values show only minor differences .",
    "our choice of initial conditions is based on observations of super star clusters .",
    "all our simulated clusters have initial virial radii between @xmath19 ",
    "@xmath20 independent of other cluster parameters .",
    "this range corresponds to initial three - dimensional half mass radii , @xmath15 , ranging from @xmath21  @xmath22 .",
    "these values are in agreement with observations of young , massive clusters that indicate that the effective cluster sizes are rather insensitive to the cluster mass , as well as metallicity and have a median value of @xmath23 . in addition",
    ", observations of old massive lmc clusters , old gcs in ngc  5128 , old clusters in m51 , as well as the ggcs indicate that the effective cluster radii show only a weak correlation with the distance from the galactic center .    to restrict the huge parameter space to a certain extent we place all our simulated clusters in a circular orbit at a moderate galactocentric distance of @xmath24 .",
    "we avoid modeling gcs very close to the galactic center , where the galactic field is so strong that the tidal stellar loss dominates the cluster s evolution . due to the assumption of spherical symmetry , monte carlo codes can not directly model the tear - drop shaped tidal boundary of a star cluster .",
    "instead these codes use some prescription based method ( see a detailed discussion and calibration in * ? ? ?",
    "if tidal dissolution is the dominant driver of the gc s evolution , the approximate method may not be accurate enough . choosing a circular orbit for the simulated clusters is a simplification ; however , the results should still be valid for eccentric orbits with some effective galactocentric distance ( @xmath25 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "although initially all binaries in our models are hard at their respective positions , some of these hard binaries can become soft during the evolution of the cluster .",
    "the cluster contracts under two - body relaxation and the velocity dispersion increases making initially hard binaries soft .",
    "moreover , binaries sink to the core due to mass segregation where the velocity dispersion is higher than that at the initial binary positions .",
    "we include these soft binaries in our simulations until they are naturally disrupted via strong encounters in the cluster .",

    "we find that the surface brightness profile for the binary - burning cluster shows a prominent power - law slope near the center ( figure  [ plot : example ] ) .",
    "the core collapsed clusters are observationally defined as the clusters that show this distinct feature in their surface brightness profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "thus our results clearly indicate that the so called core - collapsed ggcs are in fact at the binary - burning stage whereas , the non core - collapsed ggcs are still contracting under two - body relaxation .",
    "this also indicates that the majority of the ggcs ( since most ggcs are non core - collapsed ) are not in energy equilibrium as was expected by some earlier theoretical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one key implication for this finding is that analytical estimates of interaction rates in a ggc must take into account the fact that the present day observed structural parameters including @xmath53 has not been constant and is still evolving .",
