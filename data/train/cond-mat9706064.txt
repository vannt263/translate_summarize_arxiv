    "one of the aspects of bond percolation that has captured the imagination of researchers is the collection of scaling properties that a percolating system exhibits in the vicinity of the transition at which the spanning cluster emerges@xcite .",
    "these scaling properties manifest themselves in various correlation functions , which reveal the structure of large finite clusters , and through the moments of the cluster size distribution function .",
    "an adjunct of these scaling properties are quantities that are _ universal _ at the percolation transition .",
    "universality reflects the insensitivity of behavior at and near the transition to details , and follows from the dominating influence of long range correlations .",
    "the key feature of the percolation transition is the emergence of the spanning cluster , and the concepts of scaling and universality are of great help in the description of its characteristics in the vicinity of the transition .",
    "many of the scaling properties of the percolation transition , and all information regarding the moments of the cluster distribution , are contained in the generating function , defined in terms of the distribution of cluster sizes as follows @xmath1 in the above , the quantity @xmath2 is the average number of clusters containing @xmath3 sites , and @xmath4 quantifies the probability that a link between sites is `` active . ''",
    "an active link is called a bond . in the simplest versions of bond percolation only those links that couple nearest neighbor sites will , with any finite probability , be bonds .    in the standard version of percolation ,",
    "only bonds connecting close - by sites are allowed to be active . a version of percolation that lends itself to exact analysis is the infinite range model investigated by wu@xcite and , as an example of a random graph , by erds and rnyi@xcite . in this model",
    "the probability that a bond exists between two sites is independent of the distance from one to the other .",
    "if there are @xmath5 sites , the probability that a bond exists between any given pair is equal to @xmath6 . in the `` thermodynamic limit '' this quantity vanishes , but the effective coordination number of each site diverges as @xmath5 , and the net probability that two sites are connected does not necessarily approach zero , or any other trivial value .",
    "the infinite range model exhibits a percolation transition , in that the probability , @xmath7 , that that two arbitrarily chosen sites belong to the same cluster , which is equal to zero in the thermodynamic limit when , takes on a finite value when .",
    "the equation satisfied by the quantity @xmath7 is @xmath8 the only non - negative solution to this equation is @xmath9 when @xmath10 , while a non - zero solution exists when @xmath11 .",
    "this latter solution saturates at 1 in the limit .",
    "the quantity @xmath7 is also equal to the fraction of sites contained in the spanning cluster .",
    "this cluster contains a finite fraction of all the sites in the system find in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the connection between the generating function and the statistical mechanics of a particular model was established by fortuin and kasteleyn@xcite , who demonstrated the equivalence between the percolation generating function and the partition function of the @xmath12 limit of the @xmath13-state potts model@xcite . in particular , the generating function as given by eq .",
    "( [ generating ] ) is , to within uninteresting factors , equal to the limiting ratio @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the partition function of the @xmath13-state potts model .",
    "a number of field - theoretical treatments of percolation are based on the above relation@xcite .",
    "given the generating function one can , in principle , determine the values of the quantities @xmath2 .",
    "this is because the sum in eq .",
    "( [ generating ] ) has the general form of a laplace transform , and such transforms are readily inverted . given the dependence on @xmath16 of @xmath17 one obtains the mean number of clusters containing @xmath18 sites via @xmath19    in this brief note we show that results previously obtained for the partition function of the potts model with infinite range interactions lead directly to the cluster distribution function for the infinite - range version of percolation described above .",
    "this distribution function displays all the expected scaling properties , and in addition reveals the precise way in which the spanning cluster emerges from the the `` sea '' of of clusters that remain finite in the thermodynamic limit . as the model investigated is the `` mean field '' version of short - ranged percolation , the results to be displayed for the cluster size distribution represent zeroth order approximations to the corresponding results relating to the cluster size distribution function of the physically realizable , and therefore physically relevant , short - ranged percolation@xcite .",
    "the scaling laws that characterize the critical point have direct analogues in the percolation transition .",
    "for instance , given the critical value of @xmath4 , which we denote @xmath20 , the percolation generating function in the immediate vicinity of the transition takes on the following form @xmath21 the exponents @xmath22 and @xmath23 control the asymptotic behavior of various aspects of the cluster size distribution .",
    "for example the @xmath24 moment of the cluster distribution function , equal to the expectation valued of the @xmath24 moment of the cluster size @xmath3 , is given by @xmath25 as can be established by looking at eq .",
    "( [ generating ] ) .",
    "given the scaling form in eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , the dependence of the expectation value of @xmath26 on @xmath27 is @xmath28 the constant of proportionality depends on sign of @xmath27 . eliminating the denominator in eqs .",
    "( [ moments1 ] ) , we have the following relations @xmath29 when the power @xmath30 is equal to one , the right hand side is just the total number of sites in the system , and this quantity is clearly idependent of the clustering induced by the existence of bonds . this sum rule , which is violated in the thermodynamic limit if when @xmath31 plays the role of the symmetry that is violated when there is a symmetry - breaking transition .",
    "now , the scaling form in eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , along with the inversion formula ( [ inverse ] ) implies a cluster size distribution having the following scaling form @xmath32 at the percolation transition , where , equation ( [ scaling2 ] ) implies a distribution function having the following form : @xmath33 in the mean field limit , the two exponents @xmath22 and @xmath23 take on the following values : @xmath34 then , according to eq .",
    "( [ criticalscaling ] ) , @xmath35 .    when there is a finite number of sites in the system , the cluster size distribution incorporates the number of sites , @xmath5 , by taking on the more general scaling form @xmath36 in the mean field limit , the exponent @xmath37 is equal to 3 .",
    "( [ scaling3 ] ) implies that the relation ( [ criticalscaling ] ) applies at the percolation transition until @xmath38 .",
    "the distribution of cluster sizes in mean field percolation follows directly from a result for the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) .",
    "this result was basd on an analysis of the mean field version of the @xmath13 state potts model in the limit @xmath12@xcite . in the calculation leading to a closed form expression for the generating function of the mean field potts model limits",

    "( [ inverse ] ) is straighforward to carry out . shifting the integration variable by @xmath45 , rotating by 90@xmath44 in the complex plane , multiplying by @xmath46 and integrating , one obtains immediately @xmath47 \\right .",

    ", it ought to yield the distribution of cluster sizes on a lattice in more than six dimensions , six being the upper critical dimension for short range bond percolation@xcite .",
    "in addition , it constitutes the `` zeroth order '' distribution , about which one perturbs to obtain the cluster size distribution in bond percolation in lower dimensionality .    as a test of the validity of eq .",
    "( [ finitedistribution ] ) , we have measured the distribution of cluster sizes for mean field bond percolation on systems with various numbers of sites , @xmath5 . the results are displayed in figs .",
    "the fit between the simulations and ( [ finitedistribution ] ) is excellent below the percolation transition , and when the cluster size is not too large .",
    "when @xmath48 , so that the threshold for percolation in the `` thermodynamic limit '' has been exceeded , a feature appears in the distribution in the form of a peak in the upper reaches of the distribution .",
    "this peak  which can be demonstrated to have an integrated weight of unity when @xmath49 is large and positive  corresponds to the contribution to the distribution of what becomes the spanning cluster in the limit of an infinite system .",
    "as can be seen in figure 5 , perfect agreement with simulations is not achieved for any of the systems explored . on the other hand ,",
    "there is clear evidence for convergence between the expression ( [ finitedistribution ] ) and the results of numerical calculations as the number of sites increases to fairly large values .",
    "we are confident that a system with the sufficient number of sites will have a cluster distribution that is governed by eq .",
    "( [ finitedistribution ] ) . at this point",
    ", we do not understand the reason for the slow approach of the data to what appears to be its proper limiting form .",
    "the derivation of the form ( [ finitegenerating ] ) of the generating function for percolation on a finite lattice was not entirely rigorous@xcite .",
    "the test of the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ finitedistribution ] ) can thus be regardd as a test of that form . given the clear evidence for agreement between the predictions based on that form and the results of simulations , one there is increasing confidence for the validity of the arguments that underly it .",
