    "a new generation of radio telescopes will map the polarization of cosmic radio sources over a large range of wavelengths , from a few centimetres to several metres .",
    "since the plane of polarization of a linearly polarized wave is rotated by an amount that depends on the magnetic field and free - electron distributions and the wavelength ( @xmath4 ) , the resulting data will probe both the synchrotron - emitting sources and any intervening magneto - ionic medium in unprecedented detail .",
    "a useful way to characterize the intrinsic properties of magneto - ionic media is the faraday dispersion function , @xmath2 , which contains information on the transverse orientation of the magnetic field ( @xmath5 ) and on the intrinsic polarized emission as a function of faraday depth , @xmath1 .",
    "the faraday depth is proportional to the integral along the line of sight @xmath6 of the product of the density of thermal electrons , @xmath7 , and the component of the magnetic field parallel to the line of sight : @xmath8 hence , in principle , @xmath2 can be used to obtain both the perpendicular and the parallel components of the three - dimensional magnetic field .",
    "( our system of coordinates is such that the origin is at the far end of the source and the observer is located at @xmath9 .",
    "a magnetic field pointing towards the observer yields a positive faraday depth . )",
    "reconstruction of @xmath2 is usually done by taking advantage of the fourier - transform type relationship between the observed polarized emission and the faraday dispersion function .",
    "the _ observed _ complex polarization @xmath10 can be expressed as the integral over all faraday depths of the _ intrinsic _ complex polarization @xmath2 modulated by the faraday rotation @xcite : @xmath11 so that @xmath2 can be expressed in a similar way : @xmath12 @xmath2 is a complex - valued function : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fraction of polarized flux that comes from regions of faraday depth between @xmath1 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the intrinsic polarization angle ( perpendicular to the transverse component of the magnetic field , @xmath17 ) and may itself depend on @xmath1 .",
    "equation  ( [ eqf ] ) lies at the heart of methods to recover @xmath2 from multi - frequency observations of the complex polarized intensity ( called rotation measure , rm , synthesis ; ) .",
    "the rm synthesis has been used to recover faraday components of compact sources ( e.g. @xcite ) and diffuse structures in the milky way ( e.g. ) , in nearby galaxies ( e.g. ) and in galaxy clusters ( e.g. ) .",
    "several techniques have been proposed to deal with the limited @xmath18 coverage provided by real telescopes ( rm - clean ; @xcite ; sparse analysis and compressive sensing ; , @xcite ; multiple signal classification ; @xcite ) and with the missing negative @xmath18 ( e.g. using wavelet transforms ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "also used wavelets to analyze the scales of structures in faraday space and emphasized the need to combine data at high and low frequencies .",
    "because of the difficulty of the rm synthesis technique to recover multiple faraday components , it has been suggested to use direct @xmath19 and @xmath20 fitting , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the @xmath23 and @xmath24 stokes parameters normalised to the total intensity @xmath25 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this paper we show how observations , performed in the various wavelength ranges available at existing and planned radio telescopes , can be used to constrain the variation of @xmath0 ( and therefore the orientation of the magnetic field component perpendicular to the line of sight ) with @xmath1 .",
    "we use a fisher matrix analysis to quantify the precision that can be achieved for fitted parameters and investigate the degeneracies that exist between the different constituents of our model .",
    "recently , @xcite performed a similar analysis to evaluate the capability of new radio telescopes to constrain the properties of intergalactic magnetic fields through observations of background polarized sources .",
    "their work assumed two faraday components , each with a constant @xmath0 , a narrow one ( the compact radio source ) and a broad one ( possibly associated with the milky way ) .",
    "here we consider _ a linear variation of @xmath0 with @xmath1 _ and show how the degeneracies between pairs of model parameters can be broken using complementary datasets from different instruments in order to recover @xmath3 , using two simple models of @xmath2 , a constant and a gaussian .    in the simple cases we consider , the variation of @xmath26 can be produced by a helical magnetic field .",
    "magnetic helicity is a natural consequence of dynamo action and sophisticated statistical methods have been devised to try to infer its presence , although without inclusion of faraday effects ( , ) .",
    "anomalous depolarization ( an increase rather than the usual decrease of the degree of polarization with wavelength ) produced by an helical field was discussed by @xcite .",
    "helical fields have been invoked to explain the anomalous depolarization properties of the nearby galaxy ngc  6946 ( ) and polarization characteristics of the central part of the starburst galaxy ngc  253 ( ) .",
    "helical magnetic fields are also important in galactic and protostellar jets ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "bi - helical fields ( with opposite signs of helicity on small and large scales ) are produced in simulations of galactic dynamos and the signatures of such fields are discussed in a recent paper by @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the detectability of single - helical magnetic fields .",
    "we consider observations of the stokes parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 with the instruments listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we used a nominal integration time of 1 h for the low - frequency observations ( giant meterwave radio telescope , gmrt , westerbork synthesis radio telescope , wsrt , low frequency array , lofar ) and 10 min for observations with the more sensitive instruments ( jansky very large array , jvla , australian square kilometre array pathfinder , askap and square kilometre array 1 , ska1 ) .",
    "this allows an easy comparison of the sensitivities and makes it possible to display the confidence intervals of the parameters of interest on a common graph ( figs  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we used a channel width of 1  mhz for all instruments except the jvla for which a channel width of 2  mhz is more than sufficient in the wide s - band ( 20004000  mhz ) to resolve the main features of the spectral energy distribution of the polarization . note that all instruments allow the use of narrower channels ; however , there is an obvious trade - off between sensitivity per channel and total integration time .",
    "we have varied the channel width over two orders of magnitude between 0.1 and 10  mhz and observed that the resulting precision on the main parameter of interest , @xmath27 ( equation  ( [ eqbeta ] ) ) , changes by less than @xmath28 for a same total integration time of the ska1-survey .",
    "the quoted sensitivities are indicative since several instruments listed in table  [ tab1 ] are still in their design phase .",
    "also , some bands , especially the low - frequency ones , will be affected by radio frequency interferences and a fraction of the channels will be missing . with real data at hand it will be straightforward to include the actual frequency coverage and sensitivities in the modeling of a particular data set .",
    "we scaled the sensitivities @xmath29 quoted in the literature for a given effective bandwidth @xmath30 and integration time @xmath31 to new values of the channel width @xmath32 and integration time @xmath33 , as given in the table , for a given number of tunings @xmath34 to cover the whole bandwidth : @xmath35    the jvla will be used to carry out sensitive surveys of large parts of the sky .",
    "we use figures provided by steven t. myers [ national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) ] in the karl jansky vla sky survey prospectus ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) for the jvla in its b - configuration . in the s - band ( 24  ghz ) ,",
    "the effective bandwidth ( free from radio frequency interferences ) is 1500  mhz , and a noise level of 0.1  mjy can be achieved in 7.7  seconds .",
    "the size of the synthesized beam is @xmath36 at the centre of the band . in the l - band ( 12 ghz ) ,",
    "the effective bandwidth is 600  mhz and a noise level of 0.1  mjy can be achieved in 37 seconds of integration .",
    "the size of the synthesized beam is @xmath37 . in both cases we assumed a single tuning .",
    "we note that @xcite recently submitted a science white paper for a jvla sky survey in the s - band ( in the c - configuration ) , in which they consider several alternatives ranging from a shallow all - sky survey to ultra - deep fields of a few tens of square degrees .",
    "they estimate that a shallow all - sky survey of a total of about 3000  hours would lead to the detection of over @xmath38 polarized sources .",
    "according to the askap website , a continuum sensitivity of 29 to 37 @xmath39jy  beam@xmath40 for beams between 10@xmath41 and 30@xmath41 can be reached in 1 hour for a bandwidth of 300  mhz .",
    "four tunings would be required to cover the whole frequency band from 700 to 1800  mhz , so in a total of 1 h a noise level of 1 1.3  mjy per 1  mhz channel would be reached .",
    "a major polarization survey with askap ( possum ) is in the design study phase .    in its first phase",
    ", the ska will observe at low frequencies ( 50  350 mhz , ska1-low ) , mid - frequencies ( 0.35  3.05  ghz , ska1-mid ) and in a survey mode in the 0.65  1.67  ghz range ( ska1-survey ) . in 1 hour of observation and per 0.1  mhz channel , the sensitivity is expected to be 63  @xmath39jy for ska1-mid , 103  @xmath39jy for ska1-low , and 263  @xmath39jy for ska1-survey . we have assumed a single tuning for ska1-low and that for ska1-mid four tunings ( in a 770  mhz bandwidth each ) will be needed to cover the whole band ; for ska1-survey , the maximum bandwidth will be 500  mhz , so two tunings will be needed .",
    "the corresponding noise levels per 1  mhz bandwidth and after 10 minutes of observations are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "for the gmrt 610  mhz band , our sensitivity estimate is based on the figures quoted by @xcite who reached a noise level in @xmath23 and @xmath24 of 36  @xmath39jy per beam of 24@xmath41 in 180 minutes in a 16  mhz band centered at 610  mhz .",
    "four tunings would be required to cover the whole band .",
    "our estimate of the sensitivity of the gmrt in the 325  mhz band relies on a noise level of 2.7  mjy per beam per 1  mhz channel in 1  hour , based on polarization observations of a pulsar done in 2011 ( farnes , private communication ) and assuming that all 30 antennas would be available . assuming that 2 tunings would be necessary to cover the whole band , this gives a noise level of 3.8  mjy in a total of 1  h.    the wsrt also operates in the 320  mhz band ( called the 92  cm band ) .",
    "after 1 hour of observation , the theoretical noise level in stokes @xmath25 is 1.2254  mjy  beam@xmath40 in a 10  mhz band .",
    "this corresponds to about 3.9  mjy  beam@xmath40 in a 1  mhz channel .",
    "note that confusion noise is expected to be significant in observations of the stokes parameter @xmath25 but it can be neglected @xmath23 and @xmath24 . recently detected polarization with the wsrt towards the andromeda galaxy at 350  mhz .",
    "the high - band array ( hba ) of the lofar operates at frequencies between 110  mhz and 250  mhz with a filter between 190 and 210  mhz .",
    "lofar has detected polarization in the hba and rotation measures could be inferred ( e.g. in pulsars , , and in polarized sources in the field of m  51 , mulcahy et al . , in prep . ) . however , at the lofar frequencies depolarization is extremely strong and for the fiducial models presented in this paper the measurements at the quoted sensitivities do not provide improved constraints on the parameters related to the magnetic field . the lofar frequency coverage is displayed in fig .  [ fig1 ] but",
    "the lofar confidence intervals are therefore not shown in the other figures .",

    "the emission is significantly depolarized compared to the case of a constant magnetic field orientation ( @xmath124 ) . when @xmath128 , faraday rotation counteracts the intrinsic rotation of the field , which means that the polarized emission peaks at a wavelength different from zero ( dashed lines ) , where @xmath85 ( eqs .",

    "this is because the crucial effect is faraday _ differential _ rotation across the faraday component and not the magnitude of the central faraday depth .",

    "we show how degeneracies among the parameters describing the magneto - ionic medium can be minimised by combining observations in different wavebands .",

    "since the direction of @xmath133 can be easily inferred from rm measurements , it should be possible to recover the sign ( and , under some assumptions the magnitude ) of the helicity of the magnetic field .",
    "however , the additional effect of faraday dispersion by a random component of the magnetic field attenuates the variations of the polarized emission as a function of wavelength and may shift the peak of polarized emission towards shorter wavelengths if @xmath27 is negative .",
    "faraday depolarization effects ( both by differential rotation and by dispersion ) will have to be included in the modelling of real data in order to recover information on the helicity of the magnetic field .",
