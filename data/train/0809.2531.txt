    "the understanding of the role played by impurities on the nature of phase transitions is of great importance , both from experimental and theoretical perspectives .",
    "first - order phase transitions are known to be dramatically softened under the presence of quenched randomness  @xcite , while continuous transitions may have their exponents altered under random fields or random bonds  @xcite .",
    "there are some very useful phenomenological arguments and some , perturbative in nature , theoretical results , pertaining to the occurrence and nature of phase transitions under the presence of quenched randomness  @xcite .",
    "the most celebrated criterion is that suggested by harris  @xcite .",
    "this criterion relates directly the persistence , under random bonds , of the non random behavior to the specific heat exponent @xmath0 of the pure system . according to this criterion ,",
    "if @xmath1 is positive , then the disorder will be relevant , i.e. , under the effect of the disorder , the system will reach a new critical behavior .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath1 is negative , disorder is irrelevant and the critical behavior will not change .",
    "the value @xmath2 is an inconclusive , marginal case .",
    "the 2d ising model falls into this category , it is the most studied case , but is still controversial  @xcite . in general and despite the intense efforts of the last years on several different models , our current understanding of the quenched randomness effects is rather limited and the situation appears still unclear for both cases of first- and second - order phase transitions .",
    "the present paper aims to contribute to our knowledge of the effects of quenched bond disorder on second - order phase transitions . in this quite active field of research",
    ", the resort to large scale monte carlo simulations is often necessary and useful , and following this recipe , we applied some recently developed by our group numerical schemes - see reference  @xcite and references therein - on two types of random bond ising models .    in the first part of the paper we present an extension of our numerical investigation of a random bond spin model in 2d with competing interactions , known as the random bond square saf model  @xcite .",
    "details of the pure and random version of this model with competing interactions and the motivation of such a study will be given below in the corresponding section , but can also be found in our recently published letter  @xcite and in other related papers in the literature  @xcite . furthermore , in the second part of our work , by a parallel study - using the same numerical techniques - we attempt to shed new light into the well - known random bond version of the 2d ( simple ) ising model .",
    "our investigation will be related to the extensive relevant literature concerning this case  @xcite . in particular , our discussion will focus on the main point of the last two decades , concerning the two well - known conflicting scenarios , namely the logarithmic corrections  @xcite versus the weak universality scenario  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we outline an extensive entropic sampling program .",
    "this program is based on ( i ) the wang - landau ( wl ) method  @xcite , ( ii ) the dominant energy restriction scheme  @xcite , and ( iii ) a second stage improvement that combines the wl method  @xcite and some new ideas  @xcite , suitable for the study also of disordered systems .",
    "our fss analysis of the numerical data and the corresponding discussion of the random bond versions of the square saf model and the 2d ising model are presented in sections  [ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] , respectively .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "importance sampling methods have been for many years the main tools in condensed matter physics and critical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "however , for complex systems , effective potentials may have a rugged landscape , that becomes more pronounced with increasing system size .",
    "in such cases , these traditional methods become inefficient , since they can not overcome such barriers in the state space . a large number of generalized ensemble methods",
    "have been proposed to overcome such problems  @xcite",
    ". one important class of these methods emphasizes the idea of directly sampling the energy density of states ( dos ) and may be called entropic sampling methods  @xcite . in entropic sampling , instead of sampling microstates with probability proportional to @xmath3 , we sample microstates with probability proportional to @xmath4^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath5 is the dos , thus producing a flat energy histogram .",
    "the prerequisite for the implementation of the method , is the dos information of the system , a problem that can now be handled in many adequate ways via a number of interesting approaches proposed in the last two decades .",
    "the most remarkable examples are the lee entropic  @xcite , the multicanonical  @xcite , the broad histogram  @xcite , the transition matrix  @xcite , the wl  @xcite , and the optimal ensemble methods  @xcite .    in particular",
    ", the wl algorithm  @xcite is one of the most refreshing variations of the monte carlo simulation methods introduced in the last years .",
    "the algorithm has already been successfully used in many problems of statistical physics , biophysics , and others  @xcite .",
    "to apply the wl algorithm , an appropriate energy range of interest has to be identified and a wl random walk is performed in this energy subspace .",
    "trials from a spin state with energy @xmath6 to a spin state with energy @xmath7 , using local spin flip dynamics , are accepted according to the transition probability @xmath8.\\ ] ] during the wl process the dos @xmath5 is modified ( @xmath9 ) after each spin flip trial by a modification factor @xmath10 . in the wl process ( @xmath11 )",
    "successive refinements of the dos are achieved by decreasing the modification factor @xmath12 .",
    "most implementations use an initial modification factor @xmath13 , a rule @xmath14 , and a @xmath15 flatness criterion ( on the energy histogram ) in order to move to the next refinement level ( @xmath16 )  @xcite .",
    "the process is terminated in a sufficiently high - level ( @xmath17 , whereas the detailed balanced condition limit is @xmath18 ) .    in the last few years",
    ", there have been several papers dealing with improvements and sophisticated implementations of the wl iterative process  @xcite .",
    "the present authors have introduced a dominant energy subspace implementation of the above entropic methods , called critical minimum energy subspace ( crmes ) method  @xcite .",
    "this is a method of a systematic restriction of the energy space , with increasing lattice size , by which one can determine all finite - size thermal anomalies of the system from the final accurate dos , and also other ( magnetic ) anomalies of the system by accumulating appropriate histogram data in the final almost entropic stage of the process .",
    "the ( wl ) random walk takes place in a restricted energy subspace @xmath19 and this practice produces an immense speed up , without introducing observable errors .",
    "it has been shown that the method can be followed successfully in pure systems undergoing second- or first - order phase transitions  @xcite and also in more complex systems with complicated free energy landscapes , such as the 3d random field ising model  @xcite .    for the simulation of the random bond models considered in this paper",
    ", we followed the general framework of the implementation of the above described scheme .",
    "in particular , we followed most of the details of the implementation applied recently to the 3d random field ising model and outlined for the random bond version of the saf model in our recently published letter  @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "a two stage strategy has been followed . in the first stage , a multi - range ( multi - r )",
    "wl method was applied , where the total energy range was split in many subintervals  @xcite and the dos s of these separate pieces were then joined at the end of the process .",
    "the wl refinement levels used in this first multi - r wl stage @xmath20 , were as follows : @xmath21 for @xmath22 , @xmath23 for @xmath24 , and @xmath25 for @xmath26 . in the second stage of the simulation ( wl",
    "refinement levels : @xmath27 ) , a more demanding multi - r - but with larger energy pieces - or an one - range ( one - r ) approach was carried out .",
    "the identification of the appropriate energy subspace @xmath19 for the entropic sampling of each disorder realization was carried out by applying our crmes restriction  @xcite and taking the union subspace at both pseudocritical temperatures of the specific heat and susceptibility .",
    "this union subspace , extended by @xmath28 from each side , low- and high - energy side , is in most cases sufficient for an accurate estimation of all finite - size anomalies .",
    "the identification of the appropriate energy subspace was carried out in the first multi - r wl stage , using originally a very wide energy subspace .",
    "after the first identification , the same first stage process ( @xmath29 ) was repeated several times , typically @xmath30 times , in the new restricted energy subspace . from our experience , this repeated application of this first stage multi - r wl approach greatly improves accuracy , and then the resulting accurate dos is used again for a final and more accurate redefinition of the subspace @xmath19 , in which the final entropic scheme ( second stage ) is applied .",
    "thus , the final entropic wl stage @xmath31 , where @xmath32 in all cases , was carried out in this accurately defined subspace in an one - r or in a multi - r approach . for the present models",
    ", it was found that a final multi - r approach with large subranges ( see below ) is in fact sufficiently accurate .",
    "therefore , since the multi - r of the original wl scheme improves efficiency , we applied , for most of our simulations , this multi - r wl approach also in the final entropic stage , using three times larger energy subintervals than in the initial multi - r stage .",
    "the energy subintervals of the first stage where chosen to correspond to rather large subspaces , with their sizes depending on the disorder strength . taking the pure system as reference",
    ", these energy subintervals could be chosen of the order of @xmath33 to @xmath34 energy levels , depending on the lattice size . in the disorder case ,",
    "the subinterval sizes are multiplied by the factor induced due to the new multiplicity of energy levels , giving for instance , a factor 4 for the disorder strength @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the ratio of weak over strong bond interactions ( see also next section ) .    as pointed out above",
    ", the need of using in the final stage the described multi - r approach , instead of an one - r approach , is a consequence of the slow convergence at the high wl levels .",
    "it is possible to overcome this slow convergence by using a looser flatness criterion or an alternative lee entropic final stage , as proposed in reference  @xcite and applied by the present authors  @xcite . however ,",
    "recently a different alternative has been proposed by belardinelli and pereyra ( bp )  @xcite , which is free of the application of the energy - histogram flatness criterion . following their proposal ,",
    "one is using , in the final stage , an almost continuously changing modification factor adjusted according to the rule @xmath37 .",
    "since @xmath38 is the monte carlo time , using a time - step conveniently defined proportional to the size of the energy subinterval , the efficiency of this scheme is independent of the size of the subintervals and therefore the method provides the same efficiency in both multi - r and one - r approaches .",
    "furthermore , from the tests performed by these authors , and also from our comparative studies in the 2d pure ising model ( unpublished ) , the error - behavior of this method seems superior to the original wl process , improving to some extent the saturation - error problem of the wl method .",
    "accordingly , we have also applied this alternative route for the final stage of our simulations using an one - r approach .",
    "in particular , the disorder strength case @xmath39 of the random bond square saf model , and all simulations corresponding to the larger sizes @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the random bond ising model were carried out using this alternative . from our comparative tests",
    ", we found that both approaches ( the bp and the multi - r wl approach ) produced very accurate results , with the bp approach giving superior estimates for the pseudocritical temperatures of the models .",
    "both disordered models were simulated for two values of the disorder strength @xmath36 .",
    "for the random bond square saf model we chose the values @xmath39 and @xmath35 , whereas for the random bond ising model the values @xmath35 and @xmath42 have been considered .",
    "square lattices , using periodic boundary conditions , with linear sizes @xmath43 in the range @xmath44 or @xmath45 ( disorder strength case @xmath42 ) were used .",
    "a number of @xmath46 , disorder realizations was generated and simulated for each disorder case and lattice size . even for the larger lattice sizes the statistical errors of the wl method ( wl - errors ) , used for the estimation of thermal and magnetic properties of a particular realization , were found to be much smaller than the statistical errors of the disorder averaging , coming from the fact that we have used a finite number of @xmath46 disorder realizations .",
    "therefore , the wl - errors are not shown in our graphs , whereas the latter errors of finite disorder sampling are presented in our figures as error bars . the mean values over disorder",
    "will be denoted as @xmath47_{av}$ ] , the corresponding maxima as @xmath47^{\\ast}_{av}$ ] , and finally the individual maxima as @xmath48_{av}$ ] . since in the fitting attempts of the following sections ,",
    "we have used mainly data from the peaks of the disorder averaged curves ( i.e. @xmath49^{\\ast}_{av}$ ] ) , their finite disorder sampling errors are the relevant statistical errors to be used in the fitting attempts .",
    "these errors have been estimated by two similar methods , using groups of @xmath50 to @xmath33 realizations for each lattice size and the jackknife method or a straightforward variance calculation ( blocking method )  @xcite .",
    "the jackknife method yielded some reasonably conservative errors , about @xmath51 larger than the corresponding calculated standard deviations , and are shown as error bars in our figures .",
    "finally , let us point out that in all cases studied , the sample - to - sample fluctuations for the individual maxima are much large than the corresponding finite disorder sampling errors .",
    "in this section we extend our investigation on the effects of quenched bond randomness on the square ising model with nearest- ( @xmath52 ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath53 ) antiferromagnetic interactions . in zero field , the pure square saf model ,",
    "is governed by the hamiltonian : @xmath54 where here both nearest-",
    "( @xmath52 ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath53 ) interactions are assumed to be positive .",
    "it is well - known that the model develops at low temperatures saf order for @xmath55  @xcite and by symmetry the critical behavior associated with the saf ordering is the same under @xmath56 . for the case",
    "@xmath57 , that we deal with , the pure system undergoes a second - order phase transition , in accordance with the commonly accepted scenario for many years of a non - universal critical behavior with exponents depending on the coupling ratio @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "the recent numerical study of malakis  @xcite has refined earlier estimates  @xcite for the correlation length exponent @xmath59 and values very close to those of the 2d three - state potts model @xmath60(potts)@xmath61  @xcite were obtained . from the fss of the pseudocritical temperatures  @xcite",
    "it was found that @xmath60(saf;@xmath57)@xmath62 and the subsequent study of monroe and kim  @xcite , using the fisher zeroes of the partition function , yielded a quite matching estimate : @xmath60(saf;@xmath57)@xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , from the fss of the specific heat data an estimate for the ratio @xmath64 was also found  @xcite .",
    "finally , from the magnetic data and in accordance with an earlier conjecture of binder and landau  @xcite , malakis  @xcite found additional evidence of the weak universality scenario  @xcite and obtained the values @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "size dependence of the maxima of the specific heat for the pure ( filled squares ; data taken from reference  @xcite ) and the random bond ( filled and open circles for @xmath67 and open triangles for @xmath68 ) square saf model .",
    "the inset shows a power law fit for the case @xmath67 for @xmath69 giving a negative value for the exponent @xmath70 of the order of @xmath71.,width=12 ]    the values of the above three ratios of exponents satisfy the rushbrook relation , assuming that @xmath72 , which is very close to the estimate obtained from the shift behavior of the saf @xmath57 model , thus providing self - consistency to the estimation scheme . from these results , it is tempting to conjecture , as was pointed out in reference  @xcite , that the saf model with @xmath57 obeys the same thermal exponents with the 2d three - state potts model ( @xmath73 and @xmath74  @xcite ) , but the respective values of the magnetic critical exponents are different ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 for the 2d three - state potts model  @xcite ) .",

    "the suppression of the specific heat maxima is clear for both disorder strength values and of course it is much stronger for the case @xmath68 , for which a clear saturation is observed even for the smaller sizes shown ( @xmath81 ) . for the present value @xmath67 we show in the inset of figure  [ fig:1 ] a power law fitting attempt of the form @xmath49^{\\ast}_{av}\\sim c_{\\infty}+bl^{\\alpha/\\nu}$ ] for sizes @xmath82 which gives a negative value for the exponent @xmath70 of the order of @xmath71 .",

    "@xmath67 all the above @xmath90 mentioned pseudocritical temperatures are presented and are compared to the case @xmath68",
    "the lines show two sets of simultaneous fitting attempts , according to the shift relation @xmath91^{\\ast}_{av}}=t_{c}+bl^{-1/\\nu},\\ ] ] giving @xmath92 for @xmath67 and @xmath93 for @xmath68 , respectively , for the critical temperature of the disordered model .",
    "note that the corresponding critical temperature of the pure system is @xmath94  @xcite .",
    "the values for @xmath95/dof of the fits shown depend on the method used to evaluate the statistical errors ( jackknife or simple standard deviation errors ) and in all cases studied in this paper vary in the range @xmath96 .",
    "a first estimation of the critical exponent @xmath59 of the correlation length is obtained from the above shift behavior and is @xmath97 and @xmath98 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively , as illustrated in the graph . an alternative estimation of the exponent @xmath59 is attempted now from the fss analysis of the logarithmic derivatives of the order - parameter  @xcite with respect to the temperature  @xcite @xmath99 which scale as @xmath100 with the system size . in figure  [ fig:2](b )",
    "we consider in a log - log scale the size dependence of the maxima of the average second - order logarithmic derivative of the order - parameter for @xmath67 ( open circles ) and @xmath68 ( open triangles ) .",
    "the solid and dotted lines are corresponding linear fits whose slopes provides respectively estimates for @xmath101 and thus for the exponent @xmath59 .",
    "it is clear for the figure that the slopes of the lines are different and the results we obtain from the linear fits are are @xmath102 and @xmath103 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . in the corresponding inset of figure  [ fig:2](b ) we present the first- ( filled squares ) , second- ( open circles ) , and fourth - order ( open triangles ) maxima of the average over the ensemble of realizations logarithmic derivatives of the order - parameter for the case @xmath67 .",
    "the solid , dashed , and dotted lines shown are corresponding linear fits whose slopes provide an average estimate for the exponent @xmath59 of the order of @xmath104 .",
    "these results for the exponent @xmath59 for both values of the disorder strength @xmath36 compare favorably with the estimation of @xmath59 from the above shift behavior shown in panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "thus , in comparison with its value of the pure model , the exponent @xmath59 for the disordered model shows an increase of the order of @xmath105 for the case @xmath67 and @xmath106 for the case @xmath68 , reflecting , in both cases , the strong influence of the disorder on the thermal properties of the system .",
    "noteworthy that , our estimates for the exponent @xmath59 are in agreement with the inequality @xmath107 derived by chayes  @xcite for disordered systems .",
    "turning now to the magnetic properties of the model we present in figure  [ fig:3](a ) in a log - log scale the fss behavior of the average order - parameter for @xmath67 ( open circles ) at @xmath108 and @xmath68 ( open triangles ) at @xmath109 .",
    "the straight lines show linear fits for @xmath79 with a slope of @xmath110 for @xmath67 and @xmath111 for @xmath68 .",
    "thus , these two estimations for the ratio @xmath112 indicate that although the exponent @xmath113 increases with disorder , the ratio @xmath112 remains unchanged to its pure value , i.e. @xmath114  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , we show in panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig:3 ] the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility that provides estimates for the ratio @xmath115 .",
    "the open circles refer to the case @xmath67 and the open triangles to the case @xmath68 .",
    "the solid and dotted lines are linear fits giving the values @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath115 maintains the value of the pure model for both disorder strength values considered .",
    "the ratios @xmath112 and @xmath115 for the disordered square saf model appear to be the same with the corresponding ratios of the pure square saf model but different from those of the 2d three - state potts model . therefore , our results reinforce both the weak universality scenario for the pure saf model , as first predicted by binder and landau  @xcite , as well as the generalized statement of weak universality in the presence of bond randomness , given by kim  @xcite and concerning also the 2d random bond three - state potts ferromagnet .",
    "finally , having estimated the ratios @xmath112 , @xmath115 , and the exponent @xmath59 , we attempt to estimate the specific heat exponent @xmath118 using either the rushbrook ( @xmath119 ) or equivalently , since @xmath120 , the hyperscaling ( @xmath121 ) relation . for the case",
    "@xmath67 we find a value @xmath122 which is in agreement with the value @xmath123 estimated from the fitting of the larger specific heat data shown in the inset of figure  [ fig:1 ] . in the case of a non - divergent specific heat",
    "it is quite interesting to consider also , rather than the specific heat , the internal energy scaling at the estimated critical temperature .",
    "this provides an estimate for the exponent ratio @xmath124 , which may be more precise  @xcite .",
    "we finally carried out such a fitting using the larger sizes ( @xmath69 ) on the values of the critical energy ( at @xmath108 ) and we found @xmath125 .",
    "this result , when combined with the estimate for @xmath59 from the shift behavior ( @xmath97 ) gives a value @xmath126 , an intriguing coincidence , in full agreement with the above value obtained for this ratio , via the rushbrook relation .",
    "for the case @xmath68",
    "@xcite , the saturation effect is much more stronger and an even more negative value for the specific heat exponent @xmath118 is obtained @xmath127 . from the above and in agreement with our preliminary observation in reference  @xcite , it turns out that this strong saturating behavior of the specific heat is completely different from the behavior of the 2d random bond three - state potts ferromagnet  @xcite .",
    "there , a specific heat diverging behavior is obtained for disorder strengths @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130  @xcite and an increasing but progressively saturating behavior is obtained only for the very strong disorder @xmath131@xcite .",
    "this behavior of the specific heat of the random bond square saf model may presumably be attributed to the competitive nature of interactions , responsible for the observed sensitivity of the saf model to bond randomness .",
    "the hamiltonian of the random bond version of the 2d ising model system is given by @xmath132 where again the implementation of the bond disorder follows the binary distribution  ( [ eq:3 ] ) of ferromagnetic interaction strengths .",
    "with this distribution the random ising system exhibits a unique advantage that its critical temperature @xmath133 is exactly known  @xcite as a function of the disorder strength @xmath36 through @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "this gives the opportunity of carrying out the fss analysis at the exact @xmath137 , a practice that highly reduces statistical errors .",
    "furthermore , one may check for accuracy his numerical scheme by comparing the estimated critical temperature ( via the shift behavior ) with the exact result , as we have also done here .    at this is point , it is useful to briefly discuss the two main and mutually excluded scenarios  @xcite mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the logarithmic corrections scenario is based on the quantum field theory results of dotsenko and dotsenko  @xcite , and of shalaev  @xcite , shankar  @xcite , and ludwig  @xcite . according to this",
    "scenario - supported theoretically for the case of weak disorder - the presence of quenched disorder changes the critical properties of the system only through a set of logarithmic corrections to the pure system behavior .",
    "the specific heat @xmath138 is expected to diverge on approach to the critical temperature @xmath133 in a double logarithmic form : @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the reduced critical temperature .",

    "( a ) simultaneous fitting of two pseudocritical temperatures defined in the text and estimation of the correlation length exponent .",
    "( b ) fss behavior of the averaged specific heat at @xmath141 .",
    "the solid and dotted lines are corresponding double logarithmic and power law fits ( see equations  ( [ eq:9 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] ) in the text ) .",

    "( d ) log - log plot of the averaged magnetic susceptibility at @xmath141 . in both panels ( c ) and ( d )",
    "a linear fit is applied .",
    "note that all fitting attempts shown have been performed for @xmath143.,width=16 ]    on the other hand , according to the weak universality scenario  @xcite , critical quantities , such as the zero field susceptibility , magnetization , and correlation length display power law singularities , with the corresponding exponents @xmath144 , @xmath113 , and @xmath59 changing continuously with the disorder strength ; however this variation is such that the ratios @xmath115 and @xmath112 remain constant at the pure system s value .",
    "the specific heat of the disordered system is , in this case , expected to saturate  @xcite .",
    "two significantly different values of the disorder strength , namely the cases @xmath35 and @xmath42 have been investigated by our numerical scheme and our data will be presented and analyzed below . due to marginality , the case @xmath68 , that produced in the saf model a @xmath145 temperature decline , gives here , through equation  ( [ eq:8 ] ) a critical temperature @xmath146 , very close ( @xmath147 ) to the corresponding critical temperature of the pure system ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "thus , we may call the first case ( @xmath35 ) a weak disorder and the second case ( @xmath42 ) a strong disorder case , actually producing a significant temperature decline @xmath149 .",
    "our simulations are extended to lattice sizes in the range @xmath44 for the weak disorder and in the range @xmath45 for the strong disorder , in the hope that we will observe the true asymptotic behavior of the model . for the calculation of the statistical errors due to the finite number of simulated realizations",
    ", we have followed again the practice outlined in section  [ sec:2 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath95/dof of all the fits shown below are again in the range @xmath96 .",
    "we start the presentation of our results with the case @xmath35 and our fitting attempts are summarized in figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:4](a ) shows a simultaneous fitting - including all data points - using the shift behavior  ( [ eq:5 ] ) for the estimation of the critical temperature and the correlation length exponent .",
    "now , we have used the pseudocritical temperatures @xmath83^{\\ast}_{av}}$ ] of the specific heat ( @xmath84 ) and magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath85 ) . as shown in the panel ,",
    "the estimated value for the critical temperature is @xmath150 in excellent agreement with the exact value . respectively , the estimation of the inverse of the correlation length exponent is @xmath151 , which provides a value for @xmath59 of the order @xmath152 , very close to the value @xmath153 of the pure model .    in panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig:4 ]",
    "we illustrate the data of the averaged specific heat at the exact critical temperature .",
    "the solid and dotted lines are corresponding fits of the form @xmath154_{av}(t = t_{c } ) \\sim c_{1}+c_{2}\\ln{(\\ln l)}\\ ] ] and @xmath155_{av}(t = t_{c } ) \\sim c_{\\infty}+b l^{\\alpha/\\nu}.\\ ] ] as it clear from this graph , one may not easily discern between the two lines , although a more careful analysis indicates that the double logarithmic function is more stable .",
    "we have performed both kinds of fits for three sets of data points @xmath156 .",
    "we fixed @xmath157 and varied @xmath158 as follows : @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 .",
    "we have observed that although the values of @xmath95/dof are comparable between the two functions  ( [ eq:9 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] ) , the coefficient @xmath162 of equation  ( [ eq:9 ] ) seems to be stable ( @xmath163 ) , whereas the exponent @xmath70 of equation  ( [ eq:10 ] ) fluctuates , with increasing @xmath158 , in the range @xmath164 to @xmath165 : @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 .",
    "although for this case we can not conclusively discriminate between the two alternatives , the inset in panel ( b ) shows that the specific heat data fits well to the double logarithm for lattice sizes @xmath142 .",
    "finally , in panels ( c ) and ( d ) we plot the average magnetization and the average magnetic susceptibility at the critical temperature respectively , as a function of the lattice size @xmath43 in a log - log scale . in both cases",
    "a linear fit is applied for @xmath143 giving the values @xmath169 and @xmath170 , i.e. the ratios of the magnetic exponents @xmath112 and @xmath115 maintain the values @xmath65 and @xmath66 of the pure model .",
    "the same with figure  [ fig:4 ] for @xmath42 .",
    "now data for lattice sizes up to @xmath41 are presented .",
    "all fitting attempts shown are performed for @xmath171.,width=16 ]    we proceed to present our results for the strong disorder strength @xmath42 .",
    "as was already stated above , for this value of @xmath36 we have extended our simulations up to sizes @xmath41 .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] summarizes now the critical behavior for the case @xmath172 and , in particular , in figure  [ fig:5](a ) we estimate by a simultaneous fitting attempt for the larger lattices ( @xmath142 ) the critical temperature and the correlation length exponent .",
    "the estimated value for the critical temperature is @xmath173 in good agreement with the exact value .",
    "the production of the above accurate estimates for the critical temperatures , even in this strong disorder case , constitutes a concrete reliability test , in favor of the accuracy of our numerical scheme .",
    "the estimation of the inverse of the correlation length exponent is @xmath174 , providing a value for @xmath59 of the order @xmath175 , which within error bars agrees with the pure model s correlation length exponent value . in panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig:5 ] we plot the data of the averaged specific heat at the exact critical temperature .",
    "again , the solid and dotted lines are corresponding fits of the forms  ( [ eq:9 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] ) for the larger sizes ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "our analysis for the quality of the fits for the three sets of data points @xmath156 , with @xmath176 and @xmath159 , @xmath33 , and @xmath177 indicated a good trend for the values of @xmath95/dof for the double logarithmic fits  ( [ eq:9 ] ) in the range : @xmath178 . further reliability in favor of the logarithmic corrections scenario is provided by the stability of the coefficient @xmath162 : @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , whereas the value of the exponent @xmath70 of the power law  ( [ eq:10 ] ) approaches zero with increasing @xmath158 : @xmath182 , @xmath183 , and @xmath184 . from the above , we may conclude that our numerical data are more properly described , at least for the larger lattice sizes studied , by the double logarithmic form  ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "the inset in panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig:5 ] shows again the specific heat data as a function of the double logarithm of the lattice size for @xmath171 .",
    "the solid line shown is an excellent linear fit .",
    "it should be noted that , the above power law behavior ( @xmath185 ) is in full agreement with the earlier observation of wang  @xcite in the strong disorder regime ( @xmath186 and @xmath187 )  @xcite ) .",
    "note also that , analogous results have been presented in figure 2 of reference  @xcite for the site diluted ising model , where sizes up to @xmath188 have been considered .",
    "finally , in panels ( c ) and ( d ) we plot the average magnetization and the average magnetic susceptibility at the critical temperature respectively , as a function of the lattice size @xmath43 in a log - log scale . in both cases ,",
    "the solid lines shown are linear fits for @xmath142 giving again within error bars the values of the pure model , @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively .    summarizing ,",
    "we may point out that the difficulties observed in the case of weak disorder in discriminating between the two scenarios have been surpassed by considering the strong disorder case and larger lattice sizes .",
    "in particular , we take as evidence in favor of the picture emerged from the theoretical work of dotsenko and dotsenko  @xcite and the improved versions of shalaev  @xcite , shankar  @xcite , and ludwig  @xcite , the stability of our fitting attempts using the double logarithmic law .",
    "similar conclusions have also been reported by the extensive monte carlo studies of wang  @xcite for the random bond model and also of selke  @xcite , ballesteros  @xcite , and tomita and okabe  @xcite for the site diluted model , by the transfer matrix approach of aro reis  @xcite for the random bond case , and very recently by kenna and ruiz - lorenzo  @xcite via an alternative approach that involves the density of lee - yang zeros of the site diluted model .",
    "the effects induced by the presence of quenched bond randomness on the critical behavior of two ising spin models in 2d have been investigated by a sophisticated entropic scheme based on the wang - landau algorithm . for the random bond square saf model we have extracted accurate estimates for all critical exponents and two values of the disorder strength .",
    "these values verify hyperscaling , satisfy the chayes inequality  @xcite , and obey very well the weak universality scenario for disordered systems  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the strong saturating behavior of the specific heat clearly distinguishes this case of competing interactions from other 2d random bond systems studied previously . for the marginal case of the random bond ising model ,",
    "our findings favor the well - known double logarithmic scaling scenario and suggest that the pure system behavior , @xmath153 , is recovered in the asymptotic limit . here , the estimated critical temperatures , in both cases of disorder , are in excellent agreement with the exact values obtained by duality reflecting the accuracy of the implemented entropic scheme .",
    "encouraged by this latter observation , we are currently carrying out a similar study of bond disorder effects in 2d systems undergoing first - order phase transitions .",
