    "in recent years , charge correlations , i.e. , orderings and fluctuations have been one of the central issues in the physics of organic materials @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath11@xcite is one of the most interesting families of organic compounds that exhibit short- or long - range charge correlations .",
    "the crystal structure of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath11 , where bedt - ttf = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene , consists of a stack of alternating layers of bedt - ttf and the anion @xmath12 . in the bedt - ttf layers ,",
    "the molecules form an anisotropic triangular lattice , and the anion @xmath12 controls the angle between the bedt - ttf molecules , which in turn determines the band structure .",
    "mori and coworkers @xcite obtained the electronic phase diagram in the angle - temperature space as shown in figure [ fig1 ] , @xcite which shows the wide variety of this series of materials , ranging from charge - ordered insulators such as @xmath13rbzn(scn)@xmath14 to the superconductor @xmath13i@xmath15 .",
    "further interest in this series of compounds has arisen by the observation of giant nonlinear transport for @xmath13cs@xmath16(scn)@xmath14 ( @xmath17co ,  zn ) , which causes the material to act as an organic thyristor @xcite .",
    "there , it has been pointed out that the coexistence of two types of short range charge correlations with modulation wave vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( in units of the reciprocal lattice primitive vectors in the @xmath9 , @xmath20 , and @xmath5 directions ; the @xmath9 and @xmath5 directions are shown in figure [ fig2 ] ) plays an important role in this phenomenon .",
    "the @xmath19 charge modulation is often referred to as horizontal stripe ordering since this wave vector corresponds to a stripe - type charge modulation , where the stripes run in the horizontal direction ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath21 modulation corresponds to a @xmath22 charge correlation with respect to the @xmath9-@xmath5 unit cell , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] . at high temperatures ,",
    "a diffuse x - ray spot is observed at @xmath21 @xcite , while the @xmath19 structure develops as the temperature is lowered , and the system becomes more insulating ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "when an electric field is applied , the @xmath19 horizontal stripe ordering is degraded , resulting in a recovery of the metallic behavior and thus the nonlinear transport .",
    "related to this phenomenon is the observation of lattice modulation with wave vector @xmath23 for @xmath13csco(scn)@xmath14 at a pressure of 10 kbar , which has been attributed to a pressure induced @xmath24 charge density wave because the modulation wave vector coincides with the nesting vector of the fermi surface @xcite .",

    "@xmath129 decreases with increasing @xmath26 ( from @xmath131 to @xmath132 ) , and sharply drops when @xmath132 .",
    "in fact , the increase in @xmath26 induces several effects .",
    "first , the nesting of the fermi surface is degraded ( see figure [ fig13 ] ) , second , the nesting vector deviates from the region where @xmath98 is maximized , and third , the density of states near the fermi level becomes smaller .",
    "these factors together deteriorate the charge ordering .",
    "the decrease in the density of states with increasing @xmath26 has also been pointed out in ref .",
    "figure [ fig14 ] is reminiscent of the phase diagram of the @xmath0-(bedt - ttf ) family obtained by mori _",

    "however , note that in figure [ fig14 ] , the charge susceptibility diverges at a modulation wave vector close to the nesting vector of the fermi surface ( around @xmath133 for @xmath131 ) , while the charge ordering temperature in the experimental phase diagram is that for the @xmath134 ordering , i.e. , the horizontal stripe state .",
    "the resemblance between the two figures suggests a relationship between the horizontal stripe and the @xmath9-axis threefold correlations .",
    "this may also be consistent with an experimental analysis under uniaxial pressure , which concluded that the value of @xmath26 is the key factor that dominates the occurrence of horizontal charge ordering @xcite .",
    "a possible relation between the @xmath9-axis threefold and the horizontal stripe orderings will be mentioned in the next subsection .      since the distant electron - electron interactions @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32",
    "are found to be necessary to reproduce the experimentally observed @xmath9-axis threefold charge correlations , it is reasonable to assume that the related experimental observations have to be understood within such a model .",
    "one problem to be resolved is the temperature dependences of the two diffuse x - ray peaks observed in @xmath13csco(scn)@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "since the peak in the charge susceptibility partially originates from the fermi surface nesting in the scenario described in the previous subsection , the maximum value of the peak increases with decreasing temperature , which is inconsistent with the experimental observation that the x - ray peak corresponding to the @xmath9-axis threefold charge fluctuation is nearly temperature - independent below 90k @xcite . regarding this problem , it is possible that the anions , which are not taken into account in previously studied models , may play some role .",
    "namely , in the x - ray scattering experiment , diffuse sheets ( or planes ) along the @xmath135 and the @xmath136 directions are observed at room temperature below , which is considered to be due to the effect of anions ( the diffuse sheets are shown in the lower panels of figure [ fig5 ] and figure [ fig7 ] ) @xcite . actually , the wave vectors @xmath21 ( @xmath9-axis three fold ) and @xmath19 ( horizontal stripe ) are on these diffuse sheets , and they `` grow '' from these sheets as the temperature is lowered , suggesting the relevance of the anions .",
    "kuroki considered the effect of these diffuse sheets phenomenologically by adding a term that enhances the charge susceptibility along the line @xmath135 to the denominator of eq.([chargerpa ] ) , and he found that the maximum value of the charge susceptibility saturates at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "this is because the wave vector at which @xmath89 takes its maximum gradually moves away from @xmath137 toward @xmath138 as the temperature is lowered as shown in figure [ fig15 ] ( note that the nesting is less good for the case of @xmath13csco(scn)@xmath14 ) , so that the cooperation between the diffuse sheets and the fermi surface nesting becomes degraded .     for @xmath115 at @xmath116 ( @xmath139 k ) (",
    "left ) and at @xmath140 ( @xmath141 k ) ( right).,width=302 ]    another problem is the origin of the horizontal stripe charge correlation .",
    "as mentioned in the previous sections , in the absence of the distant interactions @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , the horizontal stripe state is shown to be favored by electron - lattice coupling that distorts the lattice structure into the @xmath10-type . nevertheless , it remains a future problem as to whether this conclusion holds in the presence of the distant interactions .",
    "moreover , even if the origin of the horizontal stripe in the rb salt is the lattice distortion , the development of the horizontal stripe correlation at low temperatures in the cs salt , where such a distortion has not been observed experimentally , remains puzzling .",
    "related to this point , kuroki pointed out the possibility that the horizontal stripe charge correlation arises from the @xmath9-axis threefold correlation @xcite . for the case of the cs salt , although the nesting vector is close to @xmath137 at high temperatures , it moves toward @xmath138 ( note that we are adopting the _ folded _ brillouin zone scheme here ) upon lowering the temperature as mentioned above .",
    "thus , at low temperatures , we have two different nesting vectors close to @xmath138 and @xmath142",
    ". their coexistence in the momentum space might result in a modulation having the wave vector @xmath143 , which corresponds to that of the horizontal stripe .",
    "this may be considered as a kind of `` @xmath144 '' correlation in that the wave vectors @xmath138 and @xmath142 are close to the nesting vectors of the fermi surface , namely , the `` @xmath24 '' wave vectors at low temperatures .",
    "investigation of the occurrence of the horizontal charge correlation due to the interplay between such a `` @xmath144 '' correlation and the electron - lattice couplings ( including the interaction with anions ) will serve as an interesting future area of research .",
    "there are several studies in which the pairing symmetry of superconductivity in @xmath13i@xmath15 has been discussed @xcite .",
    "since this superconductivity lies in the vicinity of the charge - ordering phase in mori s electronic phase diagram ( figure [ fig1 ] ) , one may expect the occurrence of unconventional superconductivity due to charge fluctuations .",
    "in such a case , the form of the gap function strongly depends on the wave vector dependence of the charge fluctuation .",
    "for instance , in a model that considers electron - electron interactions up to nearest neighbors , the coexistence of spin and charge fluctuations results in competition between spin - singlet @xmath145-wave - like pairing and triplet @xmath44-wave - like pairing @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the model that takes into account the next nearest neighbor interaction , the gap function can be more complicated @xcite . since it can be expected that the many body interactions do not depend strongly on the anions ( although the band structure does ) , one must discuss the pairing symmetry for @xmath13i@xmath15 using a hamiltonian with appropriate interactions that correctly reproduces the competition between the @xmath9-axis threefold and the horizontal stripe charge correlations in the case of rb and cs salts . in this sense",
    ", the superconducting pairing symmetry should be theoretically determined after the origin of the charge correlations is completely understood .",
    "in the present paper , we have reviewed theoretical studies on the charge correlations in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath146(scn)@xmath14 .",
    "it now seems clear that within the purely electronic model on the @xmath0-type lattice with the on - site @xmath2 and the nearest neighbor @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions , the diagonal stripe , @xmath5-axis threefold , and vertical stripe charge correlations are favored in the regimes @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , respectively . in the realistic parameter regime of @xmath7 , there is competition between the @xmath5-axis threefold state and the diagonal stripe state . since these are different from the experimentally observed @xmath9-axis threefold and the horizontal stripe charge correlations , additional effects have to be taken into account to understand the experimental results .",
    "the electron - lattice coupling , which tends to distort the lattice into the @xmath10-type , is found to favor the horizontal stripe state , suggesting that the occurrence of this stripe state in actual materials is not of purely electronic origin .    on the other hand",
    ", the inclusion of the electron - lattice coupling does not explain the presence of the short - range @xmath9-axis threefold charge correlation , and we have to add distant ( next - nearest - neighbor ) electron - electron repulsions to understand this phenomenon . related to this point , a transport experiment has indicated that the repulsive interaction in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath147zn(scn)@xmath14 ( @xmath148cs , rb ) is long - range @xcite . in fact ,",
    "the presence of such a distant interaction has also been pointed out theoretically @xcite for quasi - one - dimensional organic compounds ( tmtsf)@xmath149x in the context of coexisting @xmath24 spin and @xmath24 charge density waves @xcite and spin triplet pairing superconductivity @xcite . quite recently , tahara _ et al .",
    "_ estimated the electron - electron interaction in @xmath150-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1 from a first principles calculation , and also obtained a long ranged interaction @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible that the long - range nature of the electron - electron interaction may be common in these organic materials .",
    "so far there have been few theoretical studies that take into account the distant electron - electron interactions ; thus , it is not clear whether competition between the @xmath9-axis threefold and horizontal stripe states takes place in the presence of electron - lattice couplings in such models . at the present stage",
    ", one can not completely rule out the possibility that strong correlation effects that are not taken into account in rpa or mean - field analysis may result in the horizontal stripe state in the presence of distant interactions .",
    "also , as mentioned in section [ future ] , it is possible that the anions , which have not been taken into account in theoretical models so far , play some role in the occurrence of these charge correlations . the minimal theoretical model may be more complicated than expected , and more theoretical study must be carried out to fully understand the physics of charge correlations in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1 .",
