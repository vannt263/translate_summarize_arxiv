    "a phase transformation involves _ nucleation _ and _ growth_. when an intermediate metastable phase exists between the initial metastable phase and the final stable phase , the scenario of phase transformation becomes complex and has attracted much interest from more than a decade ago  @xcite .",
    "recently , renewed interest has emerged not only in the field of traditional metallurgy  @xcite but also in the field of soft - condensed - matter physics of proteins and colloids  @xcite . even for the simple lennard - jones system below the triple point ,",
    "it has recently been suggested  @xcite that the intermediate metastable liquid plays a crucial role in the vapor to solid phase transformation .",
    "the direct microscopic computer simulation of a phase transformation using molecular dynamics or the monte carlo method is possible  @xcite but is still a difficult task . to avoid the requirement of huge computational resources and to obtain a qualitative ( coarse - grained ) picture of the kinetics of a phase transformation",
    ", a mesoscopic approach called the phase - field model , which is based on density functional theory  @xcite , has been frequently used . using this phase - field model for the nonconserved order parameter , bechhoefer et al .",
    "@xcite and celestini and ten bosch  @xcite discovered the formation of a finite layer of an intermediate metastable phase at the growing front of the stable phase .",
    "their results were also confirmed for a different class of free - energy landscape  @xcite .",
    "later , these works were further extended to the conserved order parameter  @xcite .",
    "these previous works , however , focused on growth  @xcite rather than nucleation .",
    "usually the existence of a critical nucleus has been assumed from the outset of the simulation  @xcite .",
    "it has been customary to assume two - step nucleation when there is an intermediate metastable phase  @xcite .",
    "imagine that nucleation proceeds via two successive processes : the nucleation of a metastable liquid nucleus within a vapor phase , and the subsequent nucleation of a solid phase within the metastable liquid nucleus .",
    "figure  [ fig:1](a ) shows a schematic diagram of the free energy @xmath0 of nucleation along a fictitious one - dimensional reaction coordinate when an intermediate metastable phase exists where a metastable vapor phase ( v ) transforms into a stable solid phase ( s ) via an intermediate metastable liquid phase ( l ) .",
    "this diagram implicitly assumes that the reaction coordinate is one - dimensional .",

    "they assumed that these two nucleation processes occur successively ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) ) and derived a formula for the time dependence of the volume fraction of the stable phase .",
    "they found , in particular , that the nucleation of the stable phase can be delayed by the existence of an intermediate metastable phase .",
    "their result also suggests the appearance of the long - lived metastable intermediate phase predicted by the phase - field model  @xcite .",
    "similarly , valencia and lipowsky  @xcite derived a formula for the nucleation rate assuming the intermediate metastable phase using the double - barrier model by extending the theory of kramers on the stochastic process of nucleation  @xcite .",
    "their formula also suggests that the nucleation rate of the stable phase is lower if the intermediate metastable phase exists .",
    "on the other hand , nicolis and nicolis  @xcite showed that the nucleation rate of the stable phase can be enhanced by the existence of the metastable phase by using the theory of kramers  @xcite .",
    "a similar enhancement of the nucleation rate by the existence of an intermediate metastable phase was directly observed by a numerical experiment by sear  @xcite based on the lattice model . in these theoretical studies  @xcite , however , it was implicitly assumed that the nucleation reaction coordinate is one - dimensional ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) ) and that there are two distinct nucleation barriers ( a double barrier ) .",

    "it is , therefore , not apparent if two distinct saddle points really exist in the free - energy landscape as assumed by previous authors  @xcite .",
    "incidentally , our problem resembles that of the vapor phase nucleation of a binary droplet and , therefore , resembles that of the deliquescence  @xcite . in our problem , however , two components , the liquid and the solid , come from the same metastable vapor phase . on the other hand ,",

    "our simple capillarity theory can not include such a kinetic effect as ours is based on the quasi - equilibrium thermodynamics and can not include kinetic effect .",
    "we have used the classical capillarity approximation to study the whole process of nucleation when an intermediate metastable phase is involved . by following the minimum - free - energy path in the free - energy landscape of nucleation , we studied not only the critical nucleus at the saddle point of the energy landscape but also the whole process of nucleation starting from the initial embryo .",
    "we found that the critical nucleus can be solid , composite , or liquid depending both on the relative supersaturation of the metastable liquid phase and on the wetting properties of the liquid and solid phases .",
    "the compositions of solid and liquid in the composite nucleus depends strongly on the relative supersaturation of the intermediate liquid phase .",
    "although the free - energy barrier of the critical nucleus at the saddle point can also be studied using density functional theory , a comparison of the free energy only at the critical point does not reveal much about the nucleation process when an intermediate metastable phase is involved .    since we studied nucleation and not growth ,",
    "the appearance of a macroscopic metastable phase during growth is outside the scope of this work .",
    "for such a problem , various variants of the phase - field model  @xcite will be useful .",
    "finally , we stress that our simple model based on the capillarity approximation predicted that the intermediate metastable state ( liquid ) can survive even when the metastable liquid phase is not critical  @xcite .",
    "a divergent correlation length when the intermediate metastable liquid phase is critical  @xcite and the long - range intermolecular interaction  @xcite will certainly affect the conclusions derived from our simplified capillarity theory of nucleation based on the short - range interaction .",
    "these issues are left for future investigations .",
