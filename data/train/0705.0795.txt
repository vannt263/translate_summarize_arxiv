    "one of the most profound features of quantum mechanics is that composite quantum systems can exhibit nonlocality .",
    "such an effect can be interpreted as there exist some global quantum operations performing on a composite system can not be implemented by the owners of the subsystems using local operations and classical communication ( locc ) only .",
    "actually , it is well known that any locally realizable quantum operation is necessarily separable .",
    "the converse part , however , is not always true , as a consequence of the weird phenomenon of  nonlocality without entanglement \" discovered by bennet and coworkers @xcite . on the one hand , although many partial progresses have been made , the structure of locc operations is far from well understood . on the other hand ,",
    "the class of separable operations is rather restricted and is with rich mathematical structure .",
    "it is relatively easier to determine whether a given quantum operation is separable by employing the well developed tools for the separability of quantum states .",
    "thus , a deep understanding of separable operations is of particular importance in quantum information theory .",
    "a general strategy for studying quantum nonlocality is to consider what kind of information processing tasks can be achieved by locc . roughly speaking ,",
    "if a certain task is accomplished with different optimal global and local efficiencies , then we can construct a class of quantum operations that can not be realized by locc . among these tasks ,",

    "actually , even for an arbitrary set of multipartite orthogonal product states we still do nt know how to decide the local distinguishability analytically except for the special cases of @xmath10 and @xmath3 , which were solved in ref .",

    "very recently separable operations have been widely used in order to obtain useful criteria for local distinguishability . in particular , chefles employed separable operations as a tool to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a set of general quantum states to be probabilistically distinguishable by locc @xcite , see also ref .",
    "nathanson showed that the number of @xmath11 maximally entangled states distinguishable by separable operations is at most @xmath12 @xcite and the same result was independently obtained by owari and hayashi using a slightly different method @xcite , which extensively generalized the results obtained by ghosh _",

    "all these results suggest the following question:what kind of quantum states can be perfectly distinguishable by separable operations ? \"",
    "the answer to this question will not only lead to a better understanding of the nature of separable operations , but also accelerate the present research of quantum nonlocality .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the strength and the limitation of separable operations by considering the distinguishability of quantum states under separable operations .",
    "we present a necessary and sufficient condition for the distinguishability of a set of general multipartite quantum states . assisting with this condition",

    "first we show that there exists a large class of separable operations performing on a @xmath2 quantum system can not be realized by locc .",
    "this is somewhat surprising as it indicates that the capability of separable operations is much more powerful than that of locc operations even when only the simplest composite quantum system is under consideration , which settles an open problem recently posed by gheorghiu and griffiths @xcite and highlights the nonlocal nature of separable operations .",
    "it is also worth noting that before our work only nonlocal separable operations acting on @xmath3 systems are known @xcite .",
    "second we show that any basis of the orthogonal complement of a multipartite pure state is indistinguishable by separable operations if and only if this state can not be a superposition of @xmath4 or @xmath5 orthogonal product states , i.e. , has an orthogonal schmidt number not less than @xmath6 , thus provide a generalization of the result by watrous @xcite , who proved that any basis of the orthogonal complement of a @xmath11 maximally entangled state is indistinguishable by separable operations when @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , we also present an explicit construction of indistinguishable bipartite ( or tripartite ) subspaces of dimension @xmath7 ( resp .",

    "iii we present a necessary and sufficient condition for the distinguishability of a set of orthogonal quantum states on @xmath22 by separable operations ( theorem [ exactdis ] ) .",
    "many immediate but interesting consequences of this condition are discussed in details .",

    ", the orthogonal complement of @xmath23 ) , determine the distinguishability of @xmath26 by separable operations .",
    "we show this problem can be solved analytically .",
    "two special cases are most notable .",

    "when @xmath23 is maximally entangled , such a condition is also sufficient ( corollary [ 2me ] ) . the second case of interest is that any basis @xmath26 of @xmath25 is indistinguishable by separable operations if and only if the orthogonal schmidt number of @xmath23 ( the least number of orthogonal product states that can linearly express @xmath23 ) is not less than @xmath6 ( theorem [ indissubspace ] ) .",
    "section vi is of independent interest .",
    "we give an explicit construction of an indistinguishable subspace of dimension @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) when considering a composite quantum system consisting of two qutrits ( resp .",
    "three qubits ) .",
    "we conclude the paper in section vii , and put some additional proofs in appendix .",
    "a general quantum state @xmath31 is characterized by its density operator , which is a positive semi - definite operator with trace one on @xmath22 .",
    "the density operator of a pure state @xmath32 is simply the projector @xmath33 .",

    "now we are ready to introduce the notion of separable operation .",
    "intuitively , a separable operation is a trace - preserving completely positive linear map which sends separable states to separable ones . for completeness , we state a formal definition as follows .",
    "[ so - def]a separable operation is a quantum operation with product kraus operators .",

    "more precisely , let @xmath62 be any set of separable quantum states that can be perfectly distinguishable by locc , then the mentioned separable operation can be constructed as follows : @xmath63 one can easily verify that @xmath64 .",
    "the function of @xmath65 can be intuitively understood as performing a separable povm @xmath66 on @xmath31 and then preparing a separable state @xmath67 according to the outcome @xmath68 , finally forgetting the classical information .",

    "it would be of great interest to employ lis as a tool to give tighter upper of the capacity . in the asymptotic setting similar problem",
    "has been thoroughly studied by winter @xcite .",
    "hopefully , these efforts would reveal some deep properties of lis and testify the richness of the mathematical structure of this notion .",
    "first we recall a useful representation of the concurrence of a two - qubit pure state .",
