    "measurements modify the dynamics of a quantum system , and the quantum zeno effect ( qze ) @xcite is the suppression of transitions between quantum states by frequent measurement .",
    "this result has attracted much attention since it was first discussed .",
    "it has been pointed out that the opposite effect , _",
    "i.e. _ , acceleration of a transition , may also occur ; this is known as the anti - zeno effect ( aze ) .",
    "a number of experiments claim to have verified both the qze @xcite and aze @xcite and some others are planned  @xcite .",
    "the zeno and anti - zeno effects are not restricted to coherent ( reversible ) quantum systems : both have been discussed for irreversible decay processes @xcite .",
    "recently , maniscalco _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have investigated the qze ",
    "aze crossover in the model of a damped harmonic oscillator by controlling both the environmental parameters and the system  environment coupling .",
    "a similar study  @xcite was made for a two - level system interacting with a spin bath .",
    "somewhat curiously , the most remarkable practical application of the qze consists in reducing ( and eventually suppressing ) _ decoherence _ to control the state of a quantum system @xcite .",
    "a number of interesting schemes have been proposed in the last few years to counter the effects of decoherence . among these , there are quantum error - correcting codes  @xcite , schemes based on feedback or stochastic control  @xcite , quantum optimal control  @xcite , decoherence - free subspaces and noiseless subsystems  @xcite , and mechanisms based on frequent unitary `` bang - bang '' pulses and their generalization , quantum dynamical decoupling  @xcite . in this context , it has been proposed that dynamical decoupling can be unified with the basic ideas underlying the qze  @xcite .",
    "a general discussion of controlling the decay rate using the qze was given in refs .   and  ; here we restrict ourselves to the zeno dynamics of a two - level system , for the case that the measurements probe only the system but not the bath variables .",
    "however , we do allow for bath squeezing , which is interesting from an experimental viewpoint  @xcite and leads to particularly rich zeno dynamics : it was shown that measurements sometimes reduce the decay but not always  @xcite . moreover , by frequent measurements of properly chosen observables , a complete suppression ( total zeno effect ) of the decay is possible when the system is prepared in particular eigenstates of those observables  @xcite .",
    "the choice of observables depends on the squeezing parameters of the bath .    in refs .",
    ", the survival probability was calculated in the limit of high - frequency measurement and only selective measurements were considered ; we review some results in sec .",
    "[ sec : zeffect ] .",
    "however , non - selective measurements have also been found to be relevant in the context of quantum coherence control  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : zaz ] , we show ( for the same system ) that the characteristics of the zeno effect differ significantly between selective and non - selective measurement . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numethod ] , we study the issue in a numerical framework , valid for any finite number of measurements .",
    "section  [ sec:2qb ] contains the extension from the single- to the two - qubit case , where we see both zeno and anti - zeno effects for multiple states .",
    "we then discuss our main observations and make some concluding remarks in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusion ] .",
    "let us consider a closed quantum system evolving under a hamiltonian  @xmath0 , according to the schrdinger equation @xmath1 we restrict the discussion to a two - level system or qubit , and consider projective measurement of an observable @xmath2 having the spectral decomposition @xmath3 .",
    "the index @xmath4 represents a particular measurement direction on the qubit bloch sphere .",
    "suppose the system is initialized in eigenstate  @xmath5 , then the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue @xmath6 after evolving for a short time @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 if one considers @xmath10 successive projective measurements ( separated by time steps  @xmath11 ) within a time interval @xmath12 , then the probability for the system to remain in the state @xmath5 is @xmath13 for very frequent measurement @xmath14 , the survival probability is @xmath15 which goes to @xmath16 in the limit @xmath17 , corresponding to a complete zeno effect .",
    "quantum ( anti-)zeno effects have also been discussed recently for irreversible open systems  @xcite . for a closed system with hamiltonian dynamics ,",
    "all states exhibit the zeno effect under frequent projective measurements according to eq .",
    "( [ zeno - closed ] ) , but for an open system , only selected states show the qze depending on the environment . considering characteristic times much longer than the correlation time @xmath18 of the bath or reservoir with which it interacts , the evolution of an open quantum system is well described in terms of the liouville superoperator @xmath19 by the master equation @xmath20 for a short time interval @xmath11 , the density operator in terms of its initial value is given by @xmath21 taking the system to be a qubit , we next consider measurements of  @xmath2 .",

    ", it is assumed that @xmath11 is nonetheless long enough that ( @xmath29 )  the markov approximation is valid for evolution over time  @xmath11 and ( @xmath30 )  the measurement can be taken as instantaneous on the time scale  @xmath11 .",
    "these together define the regime considered in this paper .",
    "the freezing of the initial state for frequent measurements is achieved only if @xmath31 thus , the zeno effect in general depends on the dynamics of the system and therefore indirectly on the properties of the bath with which it interacts , as well as on the observable to be measured . for an open quantum system , it is interesting to ask why only selected states show the total zeno effect unlike the case of closed systems .",
    "a key reason is the markov limit  @xcite already implicit in eq .",
    "( [ master1 ] ) ; we shall return to the issue in sec .",

    "( [ prob3 ] ) that transitions out of the initial state in general are possible even in the zeno limit .",
    "since the system is constantly being monitored , such events can be observed if they occur , and one has a choice whether to discard instances that contain them .",
